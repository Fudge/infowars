[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Resistance to tyrants, his obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:52.000]  Well, I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that President Trump is working 20 hours a day, nonstop explosively,
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  not just on the ground, not just in the air, not just on the air, but on the phones.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  Telling out in the troops, maximum attack.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  We've got to win this midterm against the giant wall of Democratic Party fraud.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  It's almost late getting on air dealing with some of the stuff that's going on,
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  but everyone could cut the tension in the air like a knife.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  But I am totally aligned with President Trump. I am totally aligned with the American people.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  I am totally aligned to remove this outside globalist force that has hijacked our country.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  And I know you're aligned with America as well, and freedom, all over the world people are.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  They know the real America, not the captured America.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  And they know the real America is coming back from the dead.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  I've never felt so much tension, though, at the spiritual level.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's almost like a quote from Darth Vader, a presence.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  I've not felt since.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's amazing what's going on.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  It's an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  So I just have to pause here for a moment, looking at all of this constellation of information.
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  I saw a headline on NewsWars.com this morning, and it just really clicked for me.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  It was Prime of the Face show. It was totally true. It's not some new revelation.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  But I really saw it for the first time how crystal clear it is.
[02:25.000 --> 02:36.000]  President Trump is battling a literal zombie horde of dead people, literally and figuratively.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  The Democrat's secret weapon has been, has always been, and will continue to be,
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  until we have systems that track this and true voter registration and true voter ID to vote,
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  that they have millions and millions and millions of dead people.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  Some of them have been dead 20, 30 years, where they've caught Democrats voting
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  in the names of people dead for 30 years.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  They've caught a bunch just lately, but dead 20 years, 25 years, 15 years.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  We are battling an army of dead people.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  This is literally the zombie apocalypse.
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  Stop zombie voters. Stop zombie voting.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  You go, well, it didn't illegal aliens? Yeah, they're a big part of it.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  Now they've finally been recruited, mainline, because local news tells them it's legal for you to vote, even when it's not.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  The deception is just unbelievable.
[03:31.000 --> 03:42.000]  So President Trump is battling just for the country existing.
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  Doesn't mean he's an angel cake. Doesn't mean he is a perfect saint. None of us are.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  But he has goodwill towards this country, and this is the battle to retake our nation and the monsters.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  Like Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Schiff and all of them are bragging that if we get in,
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  we are going to run all these chairmen ships and we are going to persecute the living snot out of the American people.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  And of course, you know that means President Trump. And of course, yours truly.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  And that's fine. I'm a big boy.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  I stepped up to the challenge of this.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  And all the time say, you know, Robert Mueller is a gangster murderer that ran Whitey Bolger execution squads.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  You know, he just had obviously Bolger killed. There's an investigation of Mueller and Whitey Bolger.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  So they said, you know, terminate. And they did.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  I'm like, no, no, I know Mueller is a killer.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  And a killer since he's 18 years old. And that's why we've got to get this dog off our throat, off our children's throats.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  Where are the men in this country? They just cower. Oh, they're gangsters. Oh, it's pee-pee on ourselves.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  Let's get these gangsters off our back and Trump isn't a gangster. He's a man.
[04:50.000 --> 05:17.000]  And he's the tip of the spear and he's leading the assault to retake the Republic.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[05:24.000 --> 05:35.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[05:41.000 --> 05:52.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:56.000 --> 06:19.000]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[06:19.000 --> 06:28.000]  I'm going to step out of the hallway.
[06:28.000 --> 06:57.000]  I'm going to step out of the hallway.
[06:57.000 --> 07:20.000]  We need to build back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  We don't consist of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[07:31.000 --> 07:38.000]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want people out of the suburbs.
[07:55.000 --> 08:04.000]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[08:04.000 --> 08:14.000]  I never missed your show, any day. I mean, never.
[08:14.000 --> 08:29.000]  Five days. Five days in this revolution we've launched to retake America from the clutches of a consortium of pure evil.
[08:29.000 --> 08:49.000]  Yonker, the heir to the Nazi throne, the king of Luxembourg stands against us with his attack dog general, 32 billion into this election, committed George Soros, New York Times today, 32 billion to crush America's will.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  They will fail.
[08:51.000 --> 09:10.000]  Even if they're able to steal the House of Representatives back, the soul of the people is awake and the states are becoming aware of the zombie voting that's going on by the dead, by the hordes that never crawl out of their graves,
[09:10.000 --> 09:21.000]  their names, their identities go on to haunt the Republic. And that's why everybody has got to not just say they're going to do it.
[09:21.000 --> 09:30.000]  Patriots, conservatives, Christians, libertarians, capitalists, we do what we say we're going to do.
[09:30.000 --> 09:44.000]  We don't virtue signal. And we've all got to go fish grandma or grandpa out of the nursing home.
[09:44.000 --> 09:53.000]  He's seeing them more anyways. We all should when they're around or dad or mom and take them down there to vote.
[09:53.000 --> 10:04.000]  And whatever you do, get them out the voter rolls when they die or they'll be voting for the Democrats. Now, there's so much to get into here.
[10:04.000 --> 10:15.000]  I mean, here's just one article out of major global studies that I should just leave the show with not even election news, giving antibiotics to toddlers boost obesity.
[10:15.000 --> 10:27.000]  You know, I know folks that own turkey farms and chicken farms in East Texas. And I know the people that run the processing of it all.
[10:27.000 --> 10:37.000]  And I remember asking them why they had huge trucks outside the facilities of antibiotics that they had sprinkled into the feed.
[10:37.000 --> 10:47.000]  And I said, why do you give them some antibiotics? Make some fat. You can feed them half as many calories and they fatten up quicker.
[10:47.000 --> 10:58.000]  They're stupid. They don't live as long. We make a lot of money feeding them antibiotics. They don't give them antibiotics to keep them from getting sick.
[10:58.000 --> 11:08.000]  They give them the antibiotics to make their body bloat with water. So that's why they want us off the air.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  People go, you don't look so healthy. Doesn't mean I'm perfect. I'm not up here like some guru about how good I am.
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  I'm saying you don't want to give your children antibiotic fed food. That's one of the biggest problems in the world that destroys their immune system.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  You get cancer. So what we do here is we do public service announcements.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  And coming up later in the next hour, I'm going to do one that I shot yesterday that's called Alex Jones comes out of the closet as a gay frog.
[11:37.000 --> 11:45.000]  Now in this incredibly serious world, some will say, why are you being silly?
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  Because the way I'm going to get to the generation Z's and the millennials is doing that. It's these type of things that could seem 20, 30, 50, 100 million times.
[11:53.000 --> 12:09.000]  And then people go and find out that Astrazine really does sterilize you, reduce your fertility and cause even in humans, same of the same hormonal inclinations that confuse the sex drive.
[12:09.000 --> 12:21.000]  So there's more than one way to skin a cat is what I'm getting out here.
[12:21.000 --> 12:31.000]  We're going to play that piece. I hope people share it from infowars.com and newswars.com because if you don't, no one will see it.
[12:31.000 --> 12:40.000]  And it's something you can send to folks and they'll be intrigued by it and they'll say, what is this ridiculousness? But then they will then discover how deadly serious this is.
[12:40.000 --> 12:49.000]  Because if I get up here and read you 20 studies that Astrazine is one of the most deadly chemicals in the world and that they've got other chemicals that could do the same thing that aren't as harmful,
[12:49.000 --> 13:00.000]  but that it's done as part of a depopulation operation. And even the former White House science are admitted that in a book he wrote in 1974.
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  And they've got even PBS admits it and scientists and Berkeley scientists.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  Some of the scientists were hired by the chemical companies to cover it up and they found out, no, it's worse than what people are saying.
[13:13.000 --> 13:25.000]  So that's why they want to shut us down is I'll read you a study about antibiotic filled meat.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  You might as well give your kids a half bottle of Jack Daniels every day. It's probably better for them. This stuff is poisoning us and it needs to stop and there's alternatives.
[13:33.000 --> 13:47.000]  But I didn't need to read a study. Every chicken farmer I know that runs an industrial operation force feeds chicken antibiotics every meal needs to stop.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  I'd rather than just inject water into it after they're killed. You want to rip somebody off, don't rip them off and kill them at the same time.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  So see, I knew that when I was 16 years old because I've had experiences I've lived and the globalists don't like that.
[14:03.000 --> 14:13.000]  They want to hurt you and your family. I don't know why on earth people would want to engage in all this or live like this from the bottom to the top,
[14:13.000 --> 14:23.000]  screwing other people over. It's not a good idea. Again, it's like going to a public pool and you don't want to get up to go take a crap.
[14:23.000 --> 14:33.000]  So you take a crap in the pool. Now you're like, oh, people don't know that a lot. A lot of these third world populations come in and they'll get in your pool and they'll crap in it.
[14:33.000 --> 14:42.000]  Shut them down in Germany. We're all the time because in Iraq or wherever, that's where some farm boy would just go out in the river.
[14:42.000 --> 14:50.000]  That's where he had a bathroom. He'd take a crap. He likes taking a crap with water up to his neck and he's going to crap in your pool and he doesn't care if they shut the whole thing down.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  He's going to crap in it and crap in it and crap in it. Well, see, people go, why are you so nice? Why do you care about other people?
[14:56.000 --> 15:08.000]  I care about myself. Okay. I don't want to crap in your pool. I don't want my kid swimming in crap. And it's the same thing. The left and everything they do is embracing the destruction of civilization and selfishly
[15:08.000 --> 15:21.000]  crapping all over us. The Democrats are the party of crapping on people. The party of thugs and dishonest slime balls and narcissistic dishonorable garbage.
[15:21.000 --> 15:33.000]  I want chivalry. I want honor. I want strength. I want will. I want my children to grow up in an incredible science fiction future with yours and we can have it all.
[15:33.000 --> 15:45.000]  But we've got to embrace our responsibility to be strong in the face of evil. And this election in T minus five days is a referendum on the soul of America.
[15:45.000 --> 15:59.000]  Regardless of whether they can steal it or not, and I believe we're going to hold the house. Regardless, everywhere else, we're winning. The planetary wave of humanity is unstoppable.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[16:10.000 --> 16:21.000]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable.

[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Teen Company.
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  Deep State began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[17:51.000 --> 18:12.000]  1 of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[20:20.000 --> 20:30.000]  Remember, all the different Hollywood stars, they're stars.
[20:30.000 --> 20:49.000]  You know where that term star comes from? It comes from Alistair Crowley, how they all have their own planet, their own star, their own place in the heavens like the pantheon of the gods, the religion of narcissism.
[20:49.000 --> 21:07.000]  Like a computer program stuck on the wheel of death or like a record skipping forever, just staring into infinity and delusionally because you can feel the mind of God believing you are God.
[21:07.000 --> 21:24.000]  Instead of exploring the universe, going up the long path, the trail of trillions of years in the ascension to finally see the face of God.
[21:24.000 --> 21:39.000]  Amazing. I just thought about that because I was reading, Hollywood reporter, oh, the Hollywood stars are going door to door asking young people to vote. Oh, oh, the stars.
[21:39.000 --> 21:51.000]  And celebrities beg people to vote Trump administration, keeping children in cages. And it's all lies.
[21:51.000 --> 22:01.000]  And then who are all these idiots that we're supposed to bow down to because we watch them while we sit there and die.
[22:01.000 --> 22:15.000]  We watch the false reality that someone else that craves to run your life and run your mind is building for you. These are the slaves.
[22:15.000 --> 22:29.000]  These are the empty people that read off someone else's script. They don't have an original thought in their traitorous little brains.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  I really don't want to subject you to this, but I think we should probably play it.
[22:34.000 --> 22:51.000]  I'm going to put it off. It's kind of like putting off cleaning the garage or something like that. I just, it's hard to look at, but it will motivate you, though, to know these people lost to run your lives.
[22:51.000 --> 23:02.000]  You know, the left 30 years ago kind of had me in some ways. I'm a libertarian. I'm like, yeah, live and let live. I don't want, you know, Chipper Gore telling me what music I can buy or something.
[23:02.000 --> 23:12.000]  But think about the control freak garbage they've engaged in. That is 50 billion light years worse than anything a Republican moron ever thought up.
[23:12.000 --> 23:22.000]  Look at this. New American asked back in September, censoring the web. Who's next? I have the answer. Everyone.
[23:22.000 --> 23:36.000]  The people running this planet are obsessed with running the arts and culture. And every time they get control of a nation, there's almost no art and no culture because they want to run it and dominate it
[23:36.000 --> 23:50.000]  because they vampirically want to control the talent and to rule over it and to keep it in a dark tower because they can't compete with you.
[23:50.000 --> 24:04.000]  They don't collectively feel like your strength is their strength. They think only by trampling you down and silencing you and putting an iron cage over your head and big giant steel balls with chains around your legs.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  Could they be somebody? And then they can trot you out every once in a while from the dungeon, not even being able to see because it's so bright.
[24:11.000 --> 24:20.000]  And put you in the middle of a stadium so they can dance around their little gold tutu and slap you in the face. And I'm so powerful. That's what they do. That's their spirit.
[24:20.000 --> 24:32.000]  A little demon elf. We're all just chained down and they're just stabbing. I said, I want me to stab you again. I'm powerful. Look what I did.
[24:32.000 --> 24:45.000]  We're powerful. We are willing to kill a baby and take its essence and energy. We are selfish. We have the will to do it. You don't have the will, Alex Jones, to do what Robert Mueller does.
[24:45.000 --> 24:53.000]  You don't have the will to do what Obama does. You don't have the will to do what George Soros does. You don't have the will like we do. Yeah, right.
[24:53.000 --> 25:09.000]  I've got the will to defeat you. I've got the will to destroy you. And I've got the fire to set the blaze in the minds of men that has already consumed you.
[25:09.000 --> 25:26.000]  And in your devil worshiping narcissism, you were already fully on fire by the time you figured out what we'd done to you. And I don't say this is some arrogant, evil voice for the audience.
[25:26.000 --> 25:34.000]  I say it because these people couldn't command evil if they tried.
[25:34.000 --> 25:42.000]  You have been put in the positions of power by your master because you are weak. Your master is just like you.
[25:42.000 --> 25:51.000]  That's why you put in stupid people under you so you can feel powerful. You are losers.
[25:51.000 --> 26:06.000]  Satan, the devil, Lucifer, the morning star is a counterfeit of the real morning star, Jesus Christ. You are broken.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  You want the rest of the world to be broken and failed because misery loves company.
[26:12.000 --> 26:22.000]  You want to tell us we're broken and failed because we're not broken and failed like you are. You are consciously broken and failed.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  Now, I'm going to stop preaching when we come back. And I'm going to get into all the news. I have to control myself. There's a lot of it.
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  I got a bunch of guests joining us. Andrew Torba had people try to blow up his parents' house.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  Where's Gabb? Oh, you're right, Winger. You can have your own website. Oh, but now you can't.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  It's past censorship now. It's just shut down now. It doesn't matter if this game guy had accounts on Instagram and on Facebook.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  That's okay when somebody does that on theirs, just not on an independent one.
[26:59.000 --> 27:07.000]  Is Gabb back up? I guess they're still on Twitter. No, the site's not back up, so he's going to be joining us.
[27:07.000 --> 27:14.000]  And then Paul Joseph Watson and then somebody else that I think you're going to find exciting.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  I think we'll leave it until that person joins us here today.
[27:18.000 --> 27:24.000]  And then Mike Adams was hosting the fourth hour, and then the war room comes roaring back out of the gates with Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone,
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  three o'clock central. We are the most demonized, most censored, most feared broadcast in the world by evil.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  Not because we're perfect, but because we love God.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  Because the enemy knows that I'm going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  I'm going to see it through. I'm going to be faithful. I'm going to be committed.
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  The enemy sees that as dog-like. They see that as stupid because they didn't build anything.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  They don't have what it takes to go the long distance. They don't have what it takes to make the commitments.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  They don't have what it takes to stand against the evil, to get laughed at, to get demonized, to get attacked,
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  because they are weak and twisted and failed.
[28:10.000 --> 28:19.000]  So you can feel the spiritual energy in the planet raging.
[28:19.000 --> 28:32.000]  And we're going to remove these little gangsters that have been squatting on America for decade after decade and sucking the very life out of us.
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  We also have some other special guests joining us. As I said, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  We've got the latest on the caravan, the latest in the global libertarian revolution exploding,
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  the latest on anchor-baby births outnumbering natural births in the United States,
[28:48.000 --> 29:09.000]  and more straight ahead on the other side of the antidote to the globalists. Stay with us.

[33:25.000 --> 33:51.000]  Leading of Fondue Assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:51.000 --> 34:00.000]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., we're here live. This is the Infowar. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  Coming up, 8 a.m. every day, David Knight, The David Knight Show.
[34:06.000 --> 34:24.000]  And then, of course, The War Room. We've got nightly coverage with myself and many others, 8 to 10 p.m. right through the election and for another week after the election, and then soon thereafter, we're going to launch a new weeknight roundtable broadcast from 7 to 10 p.m.
[34:24.000 --> 34:36.000]  They're going to give everybody a little bit of a break after the election, though, with the crew here to reform and make that push. The globalists, but everything they can to stop us from going 24 hours a day, but they've been failing.
[34:36.000 --> 35:01.000]  But it is kind of like in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, when the knights that go, and that one knight's had his arms and legs chopped off and refuses to give up. I could sit around and joke about that, but Andrew Torbub is a really smart guy, a nice guy, and he launched the only independent social media network out there, and it is a major competitor,
[35:01.000 --> 35:19.000]  would be, because it's exponentially growing, and you can see the logarithmic growth, and so they are now shutting down, taking the banks away, the credit card processing away, the web hosting away, the attorney general of the state of Pennsylvania is investigating him.
[35:19.000 --> 35:32.000]  Even though the very same guy was on Instagram and on Facebook saying the same crap, and under law, Torbub's protected, the guy said, I'm going in four minutes before he shot the people.
[35:32.000 --> 35:45.000]  But again, they just look at that, that that's the site that helped him do it. It helped him, why he was able to have a, like a web posting area.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  They don't want you to be able to communicate, and then once they've set the precedent there, they're going to move through to everything.
[35:50.000 --> 36:18.000]  So, GAB founder, Don Sellers, I wrote about this for him, FullWars.com, GAB founder blames media after parents targeted in alleged murder plot. And then he's here to tell you what happened at their house, because this is what people do. They docks where you live, they docks where you live, and then they come after you.
[36:18.000 --> 36:31.000]  You saw GAB McGinnis on yesterday, they come to his house and say a terrorist lives there, and that they want you run out of the area, and then his wife comes out with her little kids, one of them holding a rag doll, and says, please be nice to us.
[36:31.000 --> 36:40.000]  And the liberals run back and go on Twitter and go, my God, five people just confronted me viciously. You're confronting them. They walk out and say, please, we have children here.
[36:40.000 --> 36:49.000]  And they go, my God, it was all five goons. They had baseball bats with nails. They don't say that, but that's the next level. Everything with them is inversion.
[36:49.000 --> 36:58.000]  Because the leftists are so stupid, they have no imagination. All they've learned, their one trick is, flip it.
[36:58.000 --> 37:10.000]  I mean, I don't, a lot of people get to hire the security of the guys, and I look at their tough bouncers or whatever, and they're like, oh, I weigh 500 pounds, and I'll stand right just behind the wrapper or whatever. That's not who we have for security.
[37:10.000 --> 37:24.000]  Because, you know, there's a lot of different types of security you can get. And me, I just get Blackwater veterans and people like that, because we've already been in the Army or the Marines or other groups, and then they got a lot of work in Blackwater.
[37:24.000 --> 37:37.000]  And so that's the type of folks we have. But see, the average person can't afford that. And it's a strain on info wars. And you know, at this point, I got them at my house all the time, all the time.
[37:37.000 --> 37:50.000]  And I'm not going to get any more after that. But that's what this country's turned into with the left. The left doesn't have to have Blackwater at their house.
[37:50.000 --> 38:05.000]  These people are terrorists. They're scum. They're harassing everybody. They're involved in mafia racketeering. Period.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  Period. And I'm tired of getting pushed around by them.
[38:11.000 --> 38:21.000]  I had a lawyer, a big lawyer, to tell me, you know how dangerous Robert Mueller is, how many people he's had killed. And I know he's a gangster from Boston.
[38:21.000 --> 38:31.000]  I know all about him running whitey bulgers and other hit teams all over the country. You don't think I don't know that Robert Mueller is the dirty tip of the spear of the FBI?
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.000]  You know, it starts out, you get guys that will kill other mobsters that are bad. And then it's pretty soon, let's just kill all the mobsters, be the mobsters ourselves.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  Somebody's got to stand up to Robert Mueller because here's the thing. I'm not a gangster. I'm a man.
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.000]  And that piece of crap is in the way of American success and exceptionalism. And I want him to, he's the one that works for Russia.
[38:49.000 --> 38:58.000]  He's the one that gave uranium to them on a tarmac. That's why he says Trump is because Robert Mueller is a dirty traitor. He hates this country.
[38:58.000 --> 39:10.000]  Let's go to Andrew Torba. Andrew, I'm sorry, I've got you on here and you're very, very busy. Recap what happened to your parents and then get into the latest and where Gab is.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  And when we can get it back up because I just hate to see the enemy have these victories.
[39:15.000 --> 39:31.000]  Well, Alex, I got a call from my mom yesterday, frankly, in the middle of the afternoon. And apparently the neighbors had smelled the gas. So she immediately called the gas company and in the midterm, my grandfather went up to the house and
[39:31.000 --> 39:50.000]  discovered that the gas grill in the back of my parents' home had been turned on. The propane tank had been turned on and the burner had been turned on and was not lit and allowed the propane to leak out into the neighborhood while my parents were not home.
[39:50.000 --> 40:09.000]  This is 100% terrorism and it's driven and propelled by the media. And what they are doing is they are projecting and they're trying to claim that because of Gab, this disgusting terrorist, Mr. Bowers, alleged terrorist, Mr. Bowers was radicalized.
[40:09.000 --> 40:29.000]  One of the reality is that he was already radicalized far before he was ever on Gab. And what they are doing, you know, by putting my face next to this terrorist and smearing it all over the internet and smearing it all over mainstream media and painting me as this terrorist and putting me alongside
[40:29.000 --> 40:49.000]  this terrorist, they are now targeting my family and it is absolutely disgusting. We are not afraid. We will not cower. We are going to continue to build. We are going to continue to fight for the fundamental human right to speak freely, for the fundamental human right to individual liberty.
[40:49.000 --> 41:06.000]  And these tactics, this terrorism is not going to scare us. It's not going to stop us. And what's going on now is we finished up yesterday late last night. We finished up getting all of the information that we needed to get to the FBI and to the Department of Justice.
[41:06.000 --> 41:19.000]  That was our top priority. We didn't even worry about getting the site back online until that was done. So now that that is completed, my team is working around the clock right now to get the site back online.
[41:19.000 --> 41:29.000]  We have secured a new domain registrar. We have secured a new hosting provider. We have numerous payment processors that have reached out. We're going to be in touch with.
[41:29.000 --> 41:39.000]  We have numerous engineers from around the world who have reached out and want to work with us and join our team to help us get the site back online and to continue to grow.
[41:39.000 --> 41:50.000]  And nothing is going to stop us. We have survived one of the most coordinated smear campaigns that I have ever seen in my life. And we are still standing.
[41:50.000 --> 42:00.000]  It's only rivaled by those on Trump and then those on InfoWars. But you're right. You now are in the third place, maybe even first place if it keeps getting worse, which I know you don't want to be in that position.
[42:00.000 --> 42:13.000]  But that's where we are. And I'm so glad that people are rallying to your aid. And let's be clear. They tried to smear Trump, but it didn't get purchased. It didn't get a toehold because the guy absolutely hated Trump in hundreds of horrible anti-Semitic posts.
[42:13.000 --> 42:22.000]  Because Trump's pro-Israel, which is just common sense. Why the hell? I mean, what the Islamists all just kill each other over there. And then you've got that going on.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  And if you expand on that, then they go, oh, because we can't blame Trump. Let's just blame the First Amendment and take out more of our competition.
[42:29.000 --> 42:45.000]  Right, Alex. And I think that's partly why the media has targeted myself and has targeted gas so viciously is because they don't have that narrative. They don't have the ability to attack Trump and to blame Trump for this horrific tragedy, which is what they normally would have done.
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.000]  That's right. GAB.com, Andrew Torbett, do five more minutes on the other side. I know you've got to go. You're very, very busy. You're about to move the next phase of getting GAB back up.
[42:51.000 --> 42:59.000]  We'll hear about the timeframe on that more. Now we support you. I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com, NewsWars.com. Tomorrow's News Today.
[43:21.000 --> 43:50.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it. It's an incredible discovery.
[43:55.000 --> 44:21.000]  X3, now available at M4WarsLive.com.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  We're looking at a way to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support your body.
[44:30.000 --> 44:39.000]  Using a proprietary process, we've managed to make this powerhouse formula into a delicious, concentrated drink mix that's loaded with high-quality ingredients.
[44:39.000 --> 44:48.000]  Perfect for a hot summer day or relaxing at home, vitamin mineral fusion is loaded with 34 different essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids and more.
[44:48.000 --> 45:00.000]  Supporting your body's needs in a great-tasting, natural and affordable drink mix with vitamin mineral fusion today, available at infowarsstore.com.
[45:00.000 --> 45:21.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[45:21.000 --> 45:30.000]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the M4. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[45:36.000 --> 45:46.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.000]  We need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[46:10.000 --> 46:18.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[46:18.000 --> 46:26.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[46:29.000 --> 46:38.000]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.000]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco bark and grape seed extract,
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.000]  our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at infowarslife.com.
[46:55.000 --> 47:11.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[47:25.000 --> 47:51.000]  Well, the globalists have been trying to keep the world in darkness.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  They've tried to plunge countries into abject poverty and enslavements they can spiritually feed on the people.
[47:57.000 --> 48:04.000]  But the light is coming back into the world and the darkness is receding.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  Alright, let's go back to Mr. Torba.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  And then I've got breaking election meddling news that's real election meddling that there's a particular story that if you get it out,
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  it may push Trump over the edge.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  And I need to do this quickly.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  Because the biggest reason they're trying to shut us down is that we're raising the alarm about the Chinese spy chips in our gear.
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.000]  Now the Chai comms, a lot of the Democrats taking over the universities and how the censorship is coming in.
[48:40.000 --> 48:48.000]  That drives the establishment crazy that you call the White House, that you talk to Trump at events, that you put pressure on the campaign people.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  And Trump keeps saying, give me answers on how we go after them and how we stop them.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  Because what they're doing is unconstitutional, it's illegal, it's wrong.
[48:56.000 --> 49:03.000]  So he says, give me a report on antitrust and they just kind of sandbagging.
[49:03.000 --> 49:10.000]  And Trump himself came up with the idea, other people that were involved in the conversation, I heard about a week before he announced it.
[49:10.000 --> 49:18.000]  When the Justice Department started suing Facebook, and Trump owns all these properties, and he was reading in the Wall Street Journal about how,
[49:18.000 --> 49:27.000]  then we're going to Andrew Torba, how they're allowed to discriminate on what color you are or your race or they have your whole medical history.
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.000]  And then they give you different prices for housing and things in different ads, depending on who you are.
[49:34.000 --> 49:44.000]  That came out like 10 years ago that big online companies would have cookies and know what, how wealthy you are or what type of spender you were.
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  And so they would show different prices to different people. That's illegal.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  And so this is way beyond that.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  So Trump got that going, but that'll take a year.
[49:57.000 --> 50:04.000]  Because Trump owns all these properties and he's saying, you can't discriminate against people like that, off what color they are.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  He said, do something about it right now, or you're fired.
[50:08.000 --> 50:15.000]  And that's who Trump is. He's the guy that opened the golf courses up to Jews and black people.
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  That's why black rappers are going to love Donald Trump until he ran as a Republican, because they know.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  And if some of those leftist rappers don't want to be real men and stand up or smile and stand up for them, go ahead and be punks.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  Go ahead. That's fine. We're not going to be punks here.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.000]  Now, Andrew Torba, when do you think GABS is coming back? Give us an estimate, other key points.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  You know, we're all rooting for you here. We're all in this together.
[50:40.000 --> 50:48.000]  Well, Alex, the media is going to be sorely disappointed as they write that GABS is finished and GABS shut down for good.
[50:48.000 --> 50:55.000]  Because we will absolutely be back and up and running this weekend before the midterm elections.
[50:55.000 --> 51:04.000]  Millions of people will be flooding to our site and they will find that the majority of our community, 98% of our community,
[51:04.000 --> 51:11.000]  is filled with great people who are posting about news and are posting about sports and are posting dog photos.
[51:11.000 --> 51:19.000]  And this narrative that this is this horrible Nazi website is going to be utterly destroyed.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  We will be back up and running by the end of this weekend.
[51:22.000 --> 51:28.000]  We're working around the clock and getting it done, and we're going to come back stronger and better than ever before.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  Before we got shut down, our growth was exploding, absolutely exploding.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  And I think that's part of the reason why they tried to shut us down multiple times over the past few years,
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  blocking us from app stores, going after our hosting providers, going after our domain registrar,
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  smearing us in the media for two and a half years straight, and none of it worked.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  None of it worked and we continue to explode in growth.
[51:51.000 --> 51:56.000]  And now that is going to be compounded a hundredfold after this situation.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  So they just shot themselves in the foot with this and they made GABS a household name as the home of free speech online.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  Well, Andrew, that's awesome.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  You know, Info Wars has got the most traffic it's ever gotten, and that's really angering them.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  I don't like the commenting section we have.
[52:13.000 --> 52:20.000]  Comments are way down, which the left celebrates because they got obviously discussed to dump us,
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  and now they're dumping other conservatives and other nationalists,
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  and it's killing the stock of these companies.
[52:27.000 --> 52:34.000]  But they just can't help it because these companies are pawns of the globalists.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  Absolutely, Alex, they're not in it for the money.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  They're not in it to make money, especially Twitter.
[52:38.000 --> 52:44.000]  Twitter just, I think, this year, after over a decade of being in operation,
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  finally turned a profit for the first quarter ever.
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.000]  So they've dumped billions and billions of dollars in these things because it's not a real business.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  It's a propaganda machine.
[52:57.000 --> 53:07.000]  It's a tool of the global elite to brainwash the masses and to push narratives to convince people to come over to their side.
[53:07.000 --> 53:12.000]  And that's why you see this censorship as well, because our ideas, the right ideas,
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  are much stronger and are much more powerful and resonate with the average working class person
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  than these ideas that these people are pushing.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  So they have no choice but to censor.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  They have no choice but to go after all media, like you, like us, like Breitbart, et cetera.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  And we're going to continue to win because people are fed up in the stick of it.
[53:32.000 --> 53:37.000]  And we don't do like the globalists on the left do, the delusionites, as I call them, the delusionals.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  We're the deplorable third of the delusionals.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  We don't just, like, hocus pocus, say something and hope it comes into being.
[53:42.000 --> 53:48.000]  All over the world for six years, they're losing every election.
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  And now they're in full, absolute, total meltdown.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  And they don't know what to do.
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  Well, I appreciate you and your busy schedule sticking to your guns and joining us and coming on
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  and continue right through the election to give us updates.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  And if it looks like you're going to be up, like you said, Saturday or Sunday night,
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  we're going to have coverage every day, seven days a week through this election.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  So please text me or call the producer or email, Andrew, because I want to be there
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.000]  to do a live special broadcast with you, you know, you can be in your office or wherever.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  When you go live, we're really excited.
[54:20.000 --> 54:27.000]  You're only out posting internet now is there at Get On Gab at Twitter.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  So thank you, Andrew Torba, for joining us.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  All right.
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  All right, I did a pretty good first hour, but I just, I feel like things are so momentous
[54:39.000 --> 54:44.000]  that I should be doing the very best broadcast of my life because this is just such a magic time.
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  And the stuff that happened before I even went on air today is so unbelievable.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  It's not even like stuff you see in movies.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  Okay.
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.000]  I mean, reality is so much cooler than virtual reality.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I can tell you that right now.
[54:59.000 --> 55:08.000]  And how could anybody be bored?
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.000]  The sky today is the most pure blue in Austin.
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.000]  I went for a walk with my wife through the woods early this morning.
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.000]  I made my baby daughter breakfast.
[55:23.000 --> 55:30.000]  I mean, God has just given us so much and it's so good and we just have to come together.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  The globalists say, oh, come together under what how we tell you how to live.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  No, come together under believing in freedom.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  Okay.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  The big news is on info wars.com.
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  And I know when I see an article and I know when it's got the teeth and the legs to really
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  do some damage to the globalist.
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.000]  And this one, election meddling, Google algorithm buries bligsit.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  And it's total proof that they're only putting negative news about bligsit and Kanye West.
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.000]  And when he really said is being buried, this is the type of thing that will drive Trump into a rage.
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  And I was wondering this morning how I was getting his hands and then it just, oh my gosh, the phone rang.
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  So a lot of good things are happening.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  A lot of really, really good things are happening.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  But Mueller is trying to figure out how to put me in prison.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  And you know, it's almost like a joke because I have zero connections to Russia or anything.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  He has total connections to selling us out and you hear it, you see it.
[56:33.000 --> 56:44.000]  But this is actually real though, this is a real criminal gangster, horrible person who, you know, ran child sex rings so he could set people up and surveil them and run blackmail rings.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  I mean, he's really bad.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  Well, of course, that's why I'm fighting him.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  You know, Bob Mueller is a murderer, right?
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  Exactly, I'm fully aware of that.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  What you don't think, I don't think that this is a suicide mission?
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  I'll never commit suicide.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  What suicide mission means, it's a very dangerous mission.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  See, this is a simulation here, me on air.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  This is the real, this is the real deal.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  That'll be funny.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  That'll be a nice little meme.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  If you're watching on TV, you saw that radio.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  I'll have to find out later.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  Uh, seriously, let me stop screwing around.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  He has a very nice looking nose though.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  Either that.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  Hey, I didn't even plug this hour.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  X3 is in, ladies and gentlemen, X3.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  It's unbelievable.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  I can't even describe how good it is.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  And it's 50% off out of the gate,

[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  Please, whatever you do realize
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts,
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  they say affiliated with Infowars.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  They even know we had like Infowars stores
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.000]  that just showed our products,
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  but they just banned them all yesterday
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  in punishment that I be in a Trump rally
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  Your excitement about America,
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  your excitement about this broadcast
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  But the globalists now want to target
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  where the resistance came from
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  so that we're not pesky in the future.
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[59:24.000 --> 59:25.000]  I want to keep going.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  I want to make them do the ultimate
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  not just destroy us financially.
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  I want to push all the way.
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  I've committed to do that.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  I've prayed for that.
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  But you've got to back us and I promise you this.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  I will never falter.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  I physically will.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  But I give you my commitment
[59:44.000 --> 59:45.000]  if you financially support us
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  at InfowarsLife.com
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  to give you my absolute total commitment.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Well, the great PJW is scheduled
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  to be joining us here in about five minutes
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  when he's missing in action right now.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  But that probably means he's beavering away
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  at something very important.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  So he'll be on.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  My little red coat never lets me down.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  So that's endearing when I say that.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Earlier, I like to defile Robert Mueller
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  because he takes himself so seriously.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  He thinks he's the president.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  He thinks he's God.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  So they had a big projection of him up on screen.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Can we do that again?
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  I'm like a little shrimp,
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  a little pilot fish that, you know,
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  goes over to a rotting carcass
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  I found at the bottom of the ocean.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  And I go over to my little feelers,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  little, little pincers.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Little, little shrimp.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  And I cast them off.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  I go, that's pretty tasty.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  And I swim back over and see that?
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  That's the new meme.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  The Alex Jones shrimp eating Robert Mueller's boogers.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Look at those blackheads.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  He's a squeeze that nose
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  and just a bunch of like inch long
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  little blackheads would come out
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  and you'd lick them all up.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  All right, it's a family show.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  And I don't normally do humor like that.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  But he takes himself real seriously.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  I kill people.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  I run things.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  America's mine.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Our mafia runs things.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  I run the FBI.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Now what you've done is you've hijacked it.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  You're not delivering uranium to the Russians.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  So takes himself real seriously.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson's here.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Paul, I just simulated being a shrimp
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  eating Robert Mueller's boogers.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Stunning and brave.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  What if I embrace myself
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  and my new identity as a booger eating shrimp?
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Well, I mean,
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  you've probably got more shrimp in your DNA
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  than Elizabeth Warren's got Native American in her.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  So it's all up for grabs at this point, right?
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Actually, I do.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  That's why I didn't identify as a peppermint shrimp
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  that was like swimming up to the dead political body.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  I don't mean literal dead.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  I went in and out into Mueller, I mean, I want him to...
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  I'm just saying, like, shrimp sometimes do,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  like, you're attracted to floating pieces of detritus.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  So that's the only reason, like, the smell
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  just brought me to him.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  What do you think?
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  I think the media matters a hit piece.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Aficionado's writing up that right now.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  Alex, as we speak.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  But you understand, like, the political metaphor
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  that Hillary Clinton is a political dead duck as well.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  She's a rotting body of political flesh
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  for us undersea buzzards to delight him.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  No, precisely.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  That's what I want to get into, Alex.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Even with all the help that she had from Google's algorithm,
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  which, according to Robert Epstein,
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  was probably about 12 million votes, she's still lost.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Now we've got this major story.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Stay there, because I want you to come out of the gates
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  with this, Paul.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  So you're going to get into Candace Owens and the Google,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  caught red-handed, engaging in election meddling.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  What else is coming up when you join us?
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Well, we can talk about the purge night riots in France.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  We've got that going on.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  We've got Target removing a black panther outfit
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  after one person complained that person was Mark Dice.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  It was a stunt just showing you the overwhelming stupidity
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  about this mob outrage culture.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  But yeah, the main thing is this election meddling from Google.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  It's absolutely massive.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  It's happening right now.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  Is it Mark Dice like wine just getting better and better?
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  I am.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  Sometimes when I'm laying there at night
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  and worried about something, I just think, oh,
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  but Mark Dice is there.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  And oh, Paul Watson and oh, Matt Drudge.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  I mean, is he not like a national treasure?
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  No, he's very effective.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And now he's actually targeting Walmart as well.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  And it is very racist for them to have this costume
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  where white boys wearing it and not all black boys.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  So hopefully it gets removed from there immediately as well.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  But of course, but they're about to have a black Superman,
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  which is fine with me.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Black James Bond, I don't care.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  The point is, is that this is incredible mind control.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  We're going to play that Mark Dice report coming up as well.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  All right.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Paul Joseph Watson is in the house.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  And yes, a new meme was born.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  The booger eating shrimp.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  That's right.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  It's true.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  OK, I've got the hots for Robert Mueller's boogers.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Yum, yum, yum.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  A little bit right back.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Nice.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  So there's no way that sensors can get between us with critical
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  articles to share the videos to tell people about the local
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  stations you're listening to.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  That's right, the Scorpions wrote Trump's theme song 30 years ago.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  For the best time of the year, the animating contest of Liberty,
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  baby.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  All Joseph Watts is about to take over and get into some of the
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  clearest election meddling you'll ever see that if this goes
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  viral, this is your mission.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  You choose to accept it.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  If this goes viral, this is why it almost has the feeling of
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  the last straw that breaks the camel's back.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And then we're going to get into this huge libertarian
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  nationalist populist Americana.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Our blueprint is the U.S.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Constitution and the Bible and Brazil first and Donald Trump.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Yeah.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  And then the same thing.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Already an army hero then survives being stabbed in the
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  liver and kidneys.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Now the other thing is the U.S.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  General Assembly in the United States.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Molucenaro and now Merkel out of power, but like a flatulence
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  out of church now that I've been in the room humor today.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  She's still the chancellor, but her party's out of power.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  She's just sitting there like a dead cicada hanging on to a
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  limb outside.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  So Paul, we're going to get into it all.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And just like they said that Hillary was going to win and she
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  didn't.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  And they pulled all the stops.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.040]  I'd say it's like 50 times the censorship,
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:22.040]  and they have mobilized a lot of young voters
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:24.040]  and they're saying, oh, those are traditionally Democrat,
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:26.640]  but that's not what I'm finding in a lot of areas.
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:28.800]  So this is really, really close
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:30.320]  because of the army of dead people
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:32.160]  that the Democrats have voting.
[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:33.280]  So before we get into candid silence,
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:37.280]  what is your gut level analysis and all the research you do?
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.280]  Trump seems to think it's neck and neck.
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:43.720]  Well, there's this new poll which you've probably seen
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:45.880]  on Drudge which is non-partisan,
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:49.120]  this Cook report which they've bumped up the number of seats
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:51.440]  that they think Democrats are gonna win in the House.
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.720]  So I don't know, it's very rare that they hold the House,
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:54.560]  isn't it?
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:56.040]  Only Bush did it after 9-11,
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:58.960]  so just going through history alone, it's very rare,
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:01.640]  but Pelosi was already out the other night on,
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:03.840]  I think it was Colbert basically saying
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:06.560]  that it was in the bag, and we've seen that before, haven't we?
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:08.600]  But again, as he said, this early voting
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:10.840]  is apparently going way in their favor.
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:13.120]  So again, we'll see if it's the backlash.
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:15.000]  In some ways, maybe they should take the House
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.600]  and make an almighty mess of it,
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:18.760]  and then Trump's gonna secure a second term,
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:22.080]  have a lame duck presidency with the Congress behind him.
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.360]  So maybe if that pendulum does swing their way,
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:25.320]  then it's at the right time,
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:26.680]  because then it'll swing back for Trump
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.880]  in his final lame duck term.
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:30.520]  Well, that's why I've looked at every angle of this.
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:33.640]  As long as Trump doesn't get killed, we can't lose.
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:36.280]  But that makes it more dangerous for him.
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:41.120]  Exactly, but again, it's the desperation that I'm seeing.
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.000]  They're so incredibly desperate.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.760]  All this fear mongering about fake news
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:46.040]  about election meddling.
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:49.280]  You had Russian bots or Russian agencies.
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:52.040]  They spent, this is the internet research agency,
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:56.120]  spent 0.05% as much on Facebook ads
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:09:58.080]  as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump did
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:09:59.920]  during the entire campaign.
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:02.600]  They spent $46,000 on Facebook ads
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:05.440]  during the entire campaign, which is basically nothing.
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:08.240]  And like half of those were for Black Lives Matter groups
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:10.080]  and all this leftist stuff anyway.
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:11.480]  So it was completely me.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.800]  Actually Paul, yeah, the Russian bot spent 80% for Democrats.
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:18.080]  Exactly, it's ridiculous.
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:21.800]  So we had this two year long fear mongering moral panic,
[1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:24.040]  contrived moral panic about fake news,
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:26.640]  which was used to ban their competitors.
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:28.360]  And yet nobody ever talks
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:30.840]  about Google algorithm manipulation, Alex.
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:32.120]  I've talked about it before.
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:33.840]  Sometimes I'm writing articles.
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:35.800]  I need to refer back to a previous article
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:37.480]  that I did for Infowars.
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:39.720]  I type in the exact headline
[1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:41.640]  and it's not even on Google.
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:44.160]  It's completely blacklisted, not every time,
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:45.000]  but many times-
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:45.840]  Sure, and that's what you know
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:47.360]  an article is very effective
[1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:49.960]  is they send it into the Phantom Zone.
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:51.680]  Yeah, I have to go on forums
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:53.480]  that have copied and pasted the text
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:55.200]  simply to find the original article
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:56.880]  that I wrote for Infowars.
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:10:59.680]  But this is so bigger than they can flash up a headline.
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:01.920]  Wired magazine, Google search algorithm
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:03.560]  could steal the presidency.
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:06.280]  Okay, this is not some right-wing conspiracy theory.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.360]  This is Robert Epstein,
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:09.880]  who's done the studies into this.
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:12.480]  Global studies with the Australian election,
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:13.960]  with the Indian election,
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:15.760]  showing, proving that the order
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:18.080]  in which Google search results are ranked
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.280]  affects swing voters in a massive, massive way.
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:23.880]  It can affect millions and millions of votes,
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:25.680]  especially on election day.
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:27.160]  So that's already established
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:29.000]  that that's a major problem.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.280]  But again, everyone's talking about Russian bots
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.880]  and the internet research agency
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:35.160]  spending next to nothing on Facebook ads,
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:36.880]  like that's an issue when it's not.
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:38.840]  They did the same thing for Brexit.
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:41.280]  And yet, what do we have happening now?
[1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:45.760]  So Candace Owens launches this, a Brexit campaign,
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:48.400]  which is, again, they've done the hit pieces.
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:51.200]  You know, we're attacked for saying that it's bad
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:53.880]  that George Soros funds political campaigns
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:55.120]  and movements across Europe
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:58.080]  that negatively affect the populations in those countries.
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:11:59.120]  We're bad.
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.560]  We're anti-Semites for criticizing George Soros
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:02.400]  for doing it.
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:04.640]  When a black woman in America, independently,
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:06.840]  independently does the exact same thing,
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:09.440]  tries to raise funds for a political project,
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:11.320]  she's completely demonized.
[1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:12.280]  And now on Google,
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:15.040]  and this is on infowars.com headline,
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:18.560]  election meddling Google algorithm buries Brexit.
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.560]  Oh, by the way, with the whole media narrative,
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:24.040]  she misspoke and said that Kanye designed the apparel
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:25.800]  when it was a friend of Kanye.
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:27.000]  And that completely blew up.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.600]  They manipulated the heck out of that.
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:30.920]  Kanye's not backing away from politics.
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:33.800]  This was just a miscommunication.
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:36.600]  But they've delisted it to the point where
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:40.480]  a website called Blacksit that's completely unaffiliated,
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:42.040]  this tiny organization,
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:45.120]  is now having to literally put out apology letters
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:48.400]  because people who want to support Candice Owens's campaign
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:50.720]  for black people to leave the Democratic Party
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:53.560]  are mistakenly donating to this small,
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:55.160]  unaffiliated organization.
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:56.000]  Why?
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.240]  Because it's the number one search ranking on Google
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:00.320]  when people are searching Blacksit.
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:02.680]  So this is political fraud
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:05.040]  and people can go to infowars.com.
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:06.840]  They'll try to block you sharing that URL,
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:08.800]  so share newswars.com.
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:09.680]  That shares a lot better.
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:10.760]  We're gonna launch some new sites soon.
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:13.480]  They're even easier to share than just the next few weeks.
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:16.520]  But you need to go there and look at the search results
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.480]  compared to DuckDuckGo or Bing.
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:19.920]  And Bing is the exact same search
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:21.480]  that Google used to have, okay?
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:25.120]  Which is an NSA clone, the NSA set it up.
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:26.000]  And if you look at this,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.720]  it shows 100% the fraud they're engaged in.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.280]  Describe this for people, Paul.
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:32.000]  Yeah, you search for Blacksit,
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.960]  which is the Blacksit wefreeblacksit.com result
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.480]  for Candace Owens's new outreach.
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:40.200]  Google, it doesn't even appear on the first three pages.
[1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:41.880]  It's all hit piece after hit piece.
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.600]  Then other websites that have nothing to do with it,
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:46.560]  which people are mistakenly donating to,
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:49.560]  you search the same thing on Yahoo, on Bing,
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:50.760]  and on DuckDuckGo.
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.360]  The official Blacksit website is the first result.
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:57.360]  So it's not because she's got her SEO wrong.
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:13:59.640]  It's because it's deliberately being blacklisted
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:01.560]  by Google.
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:03.520]  Even on these other searches,
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:06.640]  the news articles about her campaign are way more balanced.
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:09.640]  On the Google search, they're way more negative.
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:12.120]  So again, this is obvious election meddling.
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:15.360]  We've got polls that show Black voter approval
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:18.160]  for Trump has just hit a yearly high.
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:19.880]  So this is working, Alex.
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:22.120]  They need to get like 85% of Black people
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:24.920]  to vote for Democrats, otherwise they're in major trouble.
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:26.360]  So that's why they're doing this,
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:27.720]  because Candace Owens,
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:31.040]  this Blacksit campaign in addition to the Walk Away campaign,
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:34.520]  which is separate, but basically a similar idea,
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:37.280]  is having a massive, massive effect
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:39.040]  on causing people to think about
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:41.080]  how they've been basically taken for granted
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:42.680]  by the Democratic Party
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:45.560]  and how they should walk away or how they should Blacksit.
[1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:48.680]  So they're absolutely terrified about this,
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:50.800]  and that's why Googles delisted it.
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:55.240]  Well, this is the type of thing that will enrage Trump,
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:57.040]  and he's trying to figure out what to do
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:14:59.000]  and how to counter all this censorship.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.640]  And we've got direct lines to President Paul.
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:03.440]  What do you think we should do
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:04.600]  to really make this front and center?
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.400]  Because this is the issue, obviously.
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:09.440]  Well, I mean, we can only hope that Trump
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.920]  sort of gets a campaign and promote it
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:12.960]  as it should be promoted,
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:14.840]  because this is absolutely huge.
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:17.320]  You know, I featured the comments in the article
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:18.800]  from Robert Epstein,
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:21.440]  and this is when he was reacting to us being banned,
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:22.280]  by the way.
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:24.640]  He said, the fact that it's really just two or three companies,
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:27.480]  and they have similar politics makes this even crazier.
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:29.360]  He said, if these companies in November,
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:30.320]  which are now in November,
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:32.800]  all happen to be favoring the same political party,
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:34.760]  I estimate conservatively,
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:39.080]  conservatively they could shift up to 12 million votes.
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:40.080]  The election is what?
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.560]  Five days away, they want it to shift,
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:44.600]  manipulate 12 million votes.
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:45.920]  People are still undecided.
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:47.280]  This is what affects people
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.120]  making these decisions.
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.320]  This is again changing the truth in his studies.
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:51.160]  This is cheating.
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:53.440]  Well, let's come back and talk about Google openly bragged.
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:55.120]  We're about to steal the election.
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:15:59.000]  Hear that?
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.120]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:04.400]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:07.200]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:10.840]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:13.480]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device
[1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:16.720]  that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:18.360]  even when you're miles away.
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:19.920]  Security is a mindset,
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.000]  and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.440]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:58.560]  In these uncertain times,
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:00.760]  it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:02.160]  to cook food and boil water.
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:04.960]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:06.520]  or cooking over an open fire,

[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:13.560]  that only requires small quantities of sticks
[1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:14.560]  and twigs for fuel.
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:16.440]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use,
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:18.640]  smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:28.560]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:30.680]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:32.520]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:34.040]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:35.320]  I beat the IRS then
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.000]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.680]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.920]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:42.520]  they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:43.760]  I can help you too.
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:45.360]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay,
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:46.720]  don't wait another day.
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:48.920]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.840]  We need to build back
[1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:04.080]  and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:07.240]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:08.720]  that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:11.400]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.120]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights,
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:15.680]  the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:19.120]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.920]  and individuals taking those God-given rights
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:23.200]  from us as individuals.
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:24.320]  You better understand that
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:26.160]  because they're taking them right now.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.880]  We have seen what they want to do.
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.520]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:34.680]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:37.520]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:39.360]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:41.840]  They want to pack everybody into the cities
[1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:44.000]  because that's where it is easiest
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.120]  for them to control everyone.

[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:47.240]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria

[1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:10.840]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[1:20:10.840 --> 1:20:12.840]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:15.840]  We have a really important compilation
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:16.840]  of Trump speaking last night.
[1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:17.840]  We're in an intro.
[1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:20.840]  The start of the next segment, Paul leaves us.
[1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:22.840]  And then I go to the next segment,
[1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:24.840]  and I go to the next segment,
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:26.840]  and I go to the next segment,

[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:31.840]  and I go to the next segment,
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:33.840]  and I go to the next segment,
[1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:37.840]  and then I did a gay frog joke,
[1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:39.840]  because it will reach millions of young people
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:41.840]  if you get it out there.
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:43.840]  These have the memes that...
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:46.840]  that, get created, then we hijack back,
[1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:48.840]  expose male- braidathing in the water
[1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:50.840]  and sterilizing the population.
[1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:52.480]  See what we f that.
[1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:53.840]  What's going on?
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:55.840]  So that comedy piece,
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:57.840]  which is not very funny,
[1:20:57.840 --> 1:20:59.840]  and, I mean that, it's funny,
[1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:01.840]  but the subject's not funny,
[1:21:01.840 --> 1:21:05.920]  serious but you can't get a lot of young people involved unless it is funny and
[1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:08.720]  then once you do get them to watch because something's funny then they get
[1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:11.400]  very very serious so that's why another reason they've tried to shut down
[1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:15.920]  input wars is that outreach that we do thanks to all of you because the ball
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:19.480]  doesn't move down the field and the fight against these people that dream of
[1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:23.480]  running your life that we've almost gotten free of we don't move the ball in
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:28.600]  the field without you and we're seeing epic we're seeing historical we're
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:35.880]  seeing over-the-top coordinated racketeering cartels engaged in
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:41.480]  unbelievable authoritarianism and they've tested it in China that's what it is
[1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:46.000]  it's here this is the mark of the beast it's here and we have got to stop what
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:50.080]  Big Tech's doing it's got to be the central issue we're five days out of the
[1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:54.040]  election Paul Joseph Watson you were getting into Google I mean even wired
[1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:56.400]  even the New York Times we showed the articles earlier we'll put them back on
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:01.800]  screen said how Google could steal the election they're in the emails 2014 2015
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:07.920]  16 saying we will deliver the election to met to President Clinton and her
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:14.200]  ascension of our ideas and then they failed they said look we messed up last
[1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:18.440]  time we promised this time we could deliver it if they can't deliver this
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:22.640]  time Paul what do you expect the fallout to be and let's get back into the
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:27.600]  over-the-top bombshell that that intellectually they talk to their own
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:30.440]  tech people admit they're doing it they're proud of it and they go tell
[1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:36.320]  Congress we are doing no such thing what are you talking about some bar says
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:40.520]  yeah there's no bias whatsoever they say that every time don't they but yeah you
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:44.080]  can take it chronologically what was it the day after the election this leaked
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:49.200]  footage out with a bright bar meeting where their executive pitch eye says to
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:53.840]  counter misinformation and low information voters they always use these
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:59.280]  vague terms they can quote invest in machine learning and AI they call it a
[1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:03.520]  big opportunity to fix the problem then you had this you mentioned it with what
[1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:09.040]  Tucker Carlson spoke about a few weeks ago actively countering the Trump
[1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:13.200]  travel ban issue by gaming their own research results they're literally
[1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:17.680]  willing to break their own search engine they talked about quote actively
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:21.720]  countering Islamophobic algorithmically biased research results from
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:25.720]  search terms Islam Muslim Iran they also talked about doing the same thing
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:29.960]  other algorithmically biased search results from the search terms Mexico
[1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:34.120]  and what else start over sorry what else did to Tucker getting the emails that got
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:40.000]  leaked oh number one job stop it for wars exactly I mean I talked about that
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  before the break in fact I've got the exact headline here whether they fixed it
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.280]  I don't know but it was CNN refused us to report an attempted stabbing attack on
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:54.760]  Republican candidate by Democrats screaming f Trump I googled that they
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:58.720]  may have fixed it by now it may be up there but the only result was this weird
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.080]  forum called news central info was wasn't even on there so they literally
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:07.720]  delisted the entire article you know a couple of weeks ago they google blocked
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:12.000]  faith Goldie's ads for her being mayor again right before the mayoral election
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.800]  clear example of election meddling and to remind people it came out last month
[1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:22.840]  that employees of Google Facebook and Twitter they're given 2.4 million to
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:29.880]  House and Senate candidates just 8% of that went to Republicans so 82% of them
[1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:33.120]  are giving their money to Democrats there's a bottom line there is election
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:37.200]  meddling and it's by the chai comms big tech Hollywood the Democrats who have
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.920]  like you said that Russian group was like point zero zero two didn't get forty
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:46.600]  something thousand dollars in the last election cycle didn't even show up on the
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:51.160]  radar I mean it's not even a nap on the Nats but and then meanwhile the Russians
[1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:55.960]  are ruling everything oh my god meanwhile the Chinese are putting spy
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:00.600]  chips in everything stealing our national databases stealing the office of
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:04.560]  personnel management I mean it's just it's it's unbelievable trace number what
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:09.160]  the Democrats have done yeah and their own their own engineers that minute we
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:14.000]  had we had this last month as well VJ boy a patty former googling engineer who
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:17.160]  said quote the thing I find disturbing after all these years is the willingness
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:20.720]  of my former colleagues to not only comply with censorship but their
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:25.320]  enthusiasm their enthusiasm in rationalizing it that's exactly what's
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:28.840]  going on in China now with this new censored search engine which they're
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:33.280]  about to roll out we also had the good sensor report remember that again from
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:36.920]  last month they called themselves the good sensors and said that they
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:41.920]  basically had a responsibility to shift towards censorship that was
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:48.960]  literally the good demon the good devil the helpful death oh the helping China
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:52.800]  round up the Christians and kill them and now they're gonna do it here and we
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:57.120]  have good people in Google leaking continually and then their executives get
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:05.000]  up and lie spectacularly to Congress precisely and again former Google
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.840]  employee term whistleblower they all come out and admit this they all get
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.200]  regretful about it after the fact he said quote a handful of people working at
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:17.200]  a handful of technology companies through their choices will steal what a
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:22.120]  billion people a billion people thinking today that's Tristan Harris former
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:26.640]  Google executive turned whistleblower they did the same thing in Brazil people
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.800]  searching for the KKK Ku Klux Klan image of Donald Trump pops up so they get
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.400]  caught on this time and time again let's be clear they say Trump's KKK they
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:39.920]  want to learn what that is they learn they know it's the Democrats are KKK so
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:43.920]  then they totally game the results for Brazil to say it was Republicans founded
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:48.880]  the KKK and to have links in in in Portuguese and in Spanish saying the
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:54.360]  Republican Party was officially Nazi they didn't just do that in California so
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:59.320]  foreigners go to see who we are and that Republicans founded the KKK now this
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:03.720]  is pure fraud and just their PR people just write up the lie and that's the
[1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:09.360]  result or they can pick whatever why they want and link to that but remember
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:13.600]  Alex this is not political bias they merely seek to promote quote high
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:19.320]  quality content what's the high quality content is the New York Times and CNN
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:24.280]  well imagine my shot same with YouTube and owned by Google after every major
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:28.200]  news event you go on to YouTube second biggest search engine in the world by
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:32.640]  the way YouTube type in you know synagogue shooting mailbomb or whatever
[1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:38.200]  it's literally a wall of 50 mainstream news organizations on YouTube who have
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:43.080]  failed at YouTube by the way until YouTube through Google changed their
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:48.640]  algorithm to promote these mainstream news organizations above everyone else so
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:52.080]  again they literally broke their own search engine sometimes these videos
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:55.600]  from like CNN and the New York Times they've got more now because they've
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:28:00.000]  been given a leg up by YouTube but sometimes they get like 600 views and
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.240]  YouTube puts them on the trending page as if they're clear we can have three
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:07.720]  million we don't know the trending page they have 600 so it's a blood
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:11.360]  transfusion to a dying person but it doesn't work as both legs are chopped
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.240]  off and Carlos Slim puts money in and Obama puts money in and Google puts
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:19.760]  money in but the legs are chopped off telling the truth would put tourniquets
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.400]  on it but they won't do that Paul info wars.com news wars.com thank you for

[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:26.920]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:34:04.920]  we're five days out and I have never been more energized I've never felt more energy we are headed towards a major fork in the road and if we go down one road it's going to be a lot harder fight
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:24.920]  and it's going to be hellish and it's going to be horrible but we're going to win but we go down this other road it's going to be rough but it's going to be a lot better and for my children for your children can we just go down the nationalist patriot pro family pro success route that Trump wants to take us down because he's totally real
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:44.920]  and you know I mean I've been asked by people because there's hardly anybody that actually is loyal they're all double dealers they're all trying to make a deal in case Trump fails so they're back channeling and screwing Trump over which is what caused the country to fall apart to begin with
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:56.920]  and all this double dealing because evil doesn't just let you do a little bit of business with them they act like that but then they get you more more more more see I don't do that I don't double deal I don't do anything except do what I say I'm going to do
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:18.920]  and again to these leftist and people they think that's weak no that's called strength idiots and I'm not talking to I'm not talking to my regular listeners when I say that I'm talking to people out there that don't know their head from the
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:36.920]  home the ground Paul get into this huge situation in Europe because I know that the Islamists are raping and stealing and killing and you know gang raping and killing a young girl and then the left to say because you're not bringing enough Muslims in it's like they're trying to flip reality into this
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:54.920]  into this bizarro deception land like now in SMBC and CNN the new thing is there is no caravan so what would you call this well it's mass deception and going on to France which you mentioned
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:08.920]  literally there are 8000 Jews leaving Paris alone I think it's Paris maybe it's France but I think it's Paris alone every single year 8000 Jews fleeing we defend those people we say this is horrible that anti-Semitic attacks are increasing in
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:23.920]  France in all these European countries and then where called anti-Semites Alex now apparently if you use the word globalist or if you criticize George Soros funding political movements across the world that makes you an anti-Semite
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:38.920]  literally today there's going to be a big guardian hit piece on you and I calling as anti-Semites trying to link us in with this synagogue shooter who hated Trump who posted how much Trump was a globalist and that he won that's because he was going along with the Jews
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:54.920]  so we say the word globalist that means we mean Jews now we don't mean Jews we mean globalist we actually support Israel I've made numerous videos about it people say if you ask questions about him funding this migrant caravan that means you're an anti-Semite no it doesn't
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:09.920]  be clear if any Jews getting chased out of European countries and we get called anti-Semites is disgusting let's be clear Benjamin Netanyahu says Soros is anti-Israel and is the real anti person there Soros wants to get rid of Israel that's in the WikiLeaks and there's this huge
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:28.920]  article in the New York Times admitting that Soros has given 30 plus billion dollars when he really put into a tax-free foundation to take the profit from that each year that's up to a billion dollars just to try to take down Europe and the United States and they go on to say and then it shows
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:44.920]  it's so archetypal if you guys can pull the New York Times article it's better because it has it in color it shows Soros activists in Hungary pulling down paid for anti-Soros signs because that's what they do on the web here everywhere he trains the
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:38:02.920]  brigades he funds it billions of dollars a year to do this 32 billion total quadrupling down and it shows them tearing down paid for signs destroying free speech hidden in plain view oh Soros activists tear down stuff criticizing their daddy
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:17.920]  you know the guy that put you gives them the milk you know the guy that they hang off his tits like Romulus and Remus I mean this is sick and they attack of course attack me everybody else says anti-Semitic it's just pure garbage this guy was a Nazi collaborator they know that in
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:30.920]  Hungary they're sick of him so it's again Paul it's upside down world is it not yeah so what they think they're going to scare us away from criticizing George Soros no we're not going to show up about it so there's no point in even talking about it in
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:45.920]  France which we defend the Jews being chased out of the country basically last night there were more riots they called it the purge they based it on this movie which says based the plot is you can commit any crime for one night so they went on a rampage stores were looted
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:59.920]  they had flights with police in Paris as well this happened in San Denis which is the area where they have that's in Leon that you're showing now but it was on the same night also in San Denis Paris where they have 400,000 illegal immigrants in this one area
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:13.920]  of Paris alone they were throwing acid at the police they were robbing robbing grocery stores and this came like the day after Francis then interior ministry actually gave the interview back in February but it was just published a few days ago this is a
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:27.920]  fraud column who said basically they've got five years and after five years if they don't sort this out people aren't going to be living together they're going to be facing they're going to be going face to face and he admits that it's all due to mass immigration I went to
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:44.920]  Paris about five times over the past ten years Alex you could tell the difference post 2015 after this new influx of migrants from the Middle East it was literally I would go to the hotel and drive past all these little shanty towns all these tent cities where all the
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:58.920]  migrants were thinking oh this must be the outer ghetto area of Paris and it was like five minutes later you've arrived at your destination it was in the major tourist area there are mattresses on the streets the Calais migrant camp wasn't really broken up it
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:14.920]  just got dispersed out into all these major French cities as you can see there it's an absolute tip it's an absolute dump so they thought Macron was going to come in and do something because he you know he raised the migrant the Calais migrant camp but then he later
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:32.920]  gave interviews where he said no we actually want to turn Europe into Eurabia and have 150 million to 200 million Africans come in if you invite Africa into Europe Europe becomes Africa that's what happens whether that culture is better or worse we can debate that Alex I've
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:48.920]  certainly got my opinions on it but you will turn into that country so let's be clear people are fleeing literal societal collapse real road warrior conditions and then they don't want to get away from it to
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:41:02.920]  not be part of it they want to bring it to you because they're usually the worst and the weakest of the nightmare system so we're getting the worst of the worst of the worst
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:20.920]  they're chaperoned and captained by the left who believe this is some satanic ritual like defiling a baby or a virgin woman to defecate all over Europe and the US and instead they're destroying their own wealth the left is insane
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:36.920]  exactly and then when you actually look at it which I've done in all these major European countries the few pocket areas of wealthy white areas they've correlated it that's where the most pro immigration politicians and elitists live so this is all being foisted on predominantly white working
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:50.920]  class people who live in these areas which are being ghettoized and they're also the ones called racist by the elite even though it's being foisted on them the elite don't use public transport they don't have to mingle with these people they're chauffeur
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:42:05.920]  everywhere so again they don't only get the bad consequences of mass immigration they also get blamed and called racist if they complain about it well look it's a political conquering plan and the arguments are this is terribly scum wish we would exterminate them that's the left really
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:26.920]  this is a real Carnegie and Ford Foundation discussion is darn humans are so similar genetically if we release these bio weapons to wipe out the the the the Arabs in the blacks it'll jump into a lot of us and kill us and so that's the only reason it hasn't been done yet
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:43.920]  but don't worry everybody else is working on race specific bio weapons so it's only a matter of time Paul stunning job as usual at the helm of info wars dot com and news wars dot com I salute you in 1776 worldwide and thank you for both of our English roots and Scottish roots in launching 1776

[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:13.920]  we need to go back and revisit foundations of our freedom our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consists of the things that we're willing to fight for the First Amendment the bill of rights the rest of the bill of rights are prohibitions
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:29.920]  they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God given rights from us as individuals you better understand that because they're taking them right now we have seen what they want to do they called it you and
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:45.920]  21 now they call it the UN 2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's the David night show
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:44:11.920]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment from the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:27.920]  world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:43.920]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:57.920]  super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery X3 now available at infowarslife.com

[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:49.920]  I want to be troublesome and pesky I want to keep going I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially I want to push all the way I've committed to do that I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen but you've got to back us and I promise you this I will never falter I will never waver at the spiritual level I physically will

[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:08.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:20.920]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:43.920]  and less than one week Americans will go to the polls and one of the most important election of our entire lives our movement is about safe homes great jobs for every citizen our movement is about love for our fellow Americans
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:59.920]  our movement is for everyone and belongs to anyone who wants to build a better future you can do it right here in the USA right here
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:16.920]  just look at the amazing things that we have all done working together the unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:38.920]  more Americans are working today than at any point in the history of our country this is really an election between greatness and gridlock will be gridlock and it's a choice between an economy that is going strong and setting records at every level
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:47.920]  and the Democrats who are going absolutely crazy folks are going crazy
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:56.920]  this is such a great honor because together we will make America wealthy again
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:49:05.920]  we will make America strong again we will make America safe again
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:14.920]  we will make America great again thank you Florida
[1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:20.920]  we're going to put that video out compilation last night on infowars.com and I hope you'll get it out to everybody you know
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:29.920]  Trump wanted to be able to say by now keep America great but he doesn't tell you things that aren't true
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:36.920]  they call him a liar all day because it's the opposite but at first they meant he's crazy he's doing everything he said he did and they go people don't like that
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:48.920]  just saying he's a liar everyone Trump came on the show and he said I will not let you down I believe in one year we'll be able to turn things around will be evident maybe two
[1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:55.920]  because my goal is one but maybe two we're under a lot of attack it's going to take two three four
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:04.920]  and you notice what he said though there was we're going to make it great he wanted to be able to say now America's great again
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:09.920]  by breaking the will of the cancerous globalist we have not done it yet
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:19.920]  Trump's been in there for like eight rounds and twelve round match man and he has beat the living snot out of them but they keep putting new fighters in every round
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:26.920]  and they're cheating at every level it's just like the movie gladiator with a little sniveling wimp guy
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:39.920]  the little sniveling wimp guy he can't obviously fight anybody but he wants to beat the big gladiator who is also the former Roman general
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:51.920]  he wants you to beat him and so he stabs him in the heart with a stiletto because he's been advised while he's tied up you know just give him a poke in the heart
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:58.920]  he's so tough he'll take him a few minutes to die we can get him up and march him out while he's dying with a knife wound in his heart
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:06.920]  but still Maximus kills him and that story by the way is a composite of two true stories in Rome it's the whole story isn't one story
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:12.920]  it's kind of like the Patriots with Mel Gibson it's three famous stories but that all happened it's actually three stories together
[1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:19.920]  because you can't like do all three characters and build them up but the swamp fox and his kid getting killed and all that's true and it's all weaved together
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:31.920]  and that's how amazing all of this is is that they've got us basically tied down and stabbed and they've got Trump tied down and stabbed
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:40.920]  and they've been on top of us forever they got all the money because they stole it in our name and they still can't win because of one thing
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:52.920]  we're awake now we're not asleep anymore they got us into a trance and that's what this comes down to
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:57.920]  yeah there's the scene right there we got audio faded up this is a crazy time
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:09.920]  see Trump's big sin is that he doesn't want to run you into the ground to mount your head on the wall metaphysically so he feels big
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:19.920]  he doesn't need to do that he wants to see you be great because he already thinks he's great he thinks you're great and seeing you
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:24.920]  being dominated and run over makes him angry
[1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:30.920]  okay I'm gonna get to the gay frog thing which is a good a funny meme I'll explain it all next hour I'm a little bit behind
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:34.920]  we had a special guest joining us and that special guest is gonna be on tomorrow now
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:39.920]  there's a lot of stuff going on with time zones and other things and I totally understand that so special guest will be on us tomorrow
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:44.920]  but the next hour I also intend to open the phones up to take your calls
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:53.920]  now let me do this though first because I have it plugged in an hour and 52 minutes
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:53:00.920]  I've not plugged in that amount of time but for like 10 seconds and we won't be here if I don't plug because when I plug
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:05.920]  I start thinking like when I plug we bring in the money we need and when I don't we don't
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:10.920]  and I'm like please support us please help us we need help or Soros is gonna win because it's been neck and neck
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:19.920]  and I always sit back and go why won't you shut up and plug twice or three times an hour and then you get all the money you need to expand
[1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:26.920]  so the biggest problem around here is me it's just that I get so obsessed with the news that
[1:53:26.920 --> 1:53:31.920]  and then I'm sitting here right now I'm gonna be just completely honest with you
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:42.920]  it's like Providence it's not like Providence it is Providence I don't know how to describe years and years and years of research
[1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:52.920]  to bring you X1 to bring you X2 and now to bring you X3
[1:53:52.920 --> 1:54:00.920]  it's like the things that go on in my life your life they're so crazy truth strength and fiction I can't even get into
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:09.920]  how amazing this is how how the globalist are obsessed with you not having the good halogen iodine in your body
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:17.920]  and how almost all the fields and all the plants are depleted of iodine and the ocean has iodine but it's bound to iron and salt
[1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:26.920]  almost other crap and so it doesn't get into your bloodstream and how because they persecuted us five years ago six years ago
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:33.920]  and shut down our clean seaweed version that wasn't as good but was the best out there that's what I do the best
[1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:40.920]  I mean if I'm not giving you the best I feel like I'm going to hell seriously and I'm not some whip me spank me I feel guilty God
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:45.920]  it's not like that I feel totally good as long as I'm going with my total spirit and my gut to do the right thing
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:53.920]  when I'm not I'm in tortured agony that literally is what if I'm not saying Mueller you're a filthy demonic criminal that you will be defeated
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:55:02.920]  even though it's dangerous I can't sleep at night I'm trying to explain that about these products this isn't hype ladies and gentlemen
[1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:09.920]  we can't with the best seaweed base then they took our they took our supply away because leftist discovered it you've seen the harassment
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:16.920]  I never used to bitch about it because you know he wasn't existential threat I have to tell you now because you know sometimes they got my neck in the news
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:22.920]  and you get me out of it real quick and I'm right back in the next week I mean this is real touch and go like a football game you know
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:28.920]  sudden death overtime except for the future of your children and the whole world in every Google document they say
[1:55:28.920 --> 1:55:35.920]  Jones is to be stopped because they've got algorithms that show we will defeat them
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:44.920]  not hard we're promoting Americana we're promoting freedom red bloodedness men or men women or women that's what we want
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:53.920]  they can't compete with that so I prayed about this and I didn't want to announce it till we got a huge shipment of it because
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:56:00.920]  I wanted to get contracts it took time to get guaranteed contracts so anything successful we do the enemy shuts down
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:04.920]  so lawyers get involved and six months becomes a year a year becomes a year and a half
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:12.920]  but we got the deep earth crystal source from an even bigger oil company that goes even deeper so it doesn't even matter
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:14.400]  But it doesn't really matter.
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:19.400]  Now it's not 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99.
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:22.780]  It's now 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99.
[1:56:22.780 --> 1:56:26.240]  99, 99, 99, 99, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:27.740]  And we've got the contract.
[1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:29.860]  Because you think, oh, you're selling a lot of Iodine.
[1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:32.760]  These old companies, it's like, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft,
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:34.780]  $10 million of Iodine's and nothing.
[1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:36.860]  But there's like, you want us to extract that at 12,000
[1:56:36.860 --> 1:56:39.760]  feet and the guarantee delivery and blah, blah, blah?
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.300]  It's seen as like an aggregate.
[1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:42.900]  It's seen as like a side issue.
[1:56:42.900 --> 1:56:45.900]  seen as like, you know, a distraction for them. And he got to jump through all these
[1:56:45.900 --> 1:56:49.740]  issues. But now we have it, deep earth crystal source. But while we're talking to the chemists
[1:56:49.740 --> 1:56:53.380]  and scientists, everybody else, they said, but you know, like 1% of the public can't
[1:56:53.380 --> 1:56:58.700]  absorb pure atomic iodine, even though most people need the pure atomic, some can't. And
[1:56:58.700 --> 1:57:01.700]  you make it more absorbable, you need to put the two different types of iodine is a little
[1:57:01.700 --> 1:57:04.740]  bit in there and a little bit of vitamin C. And we checked around with other scientists,
[1:57:04.740 --> 1:57:10.700]  they said, absolutely this, we cannot think of a better formula for pure absorption of
[1:57:10.700 --> 1:57:19.860]  three types of iodine. We bring you survival field x3 tri iodine, literally providence.
[1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:27.460]  This is without a doubt, the ultimate iodine on the planet. And in forewarslife.com. And
[1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:31.460]  again, who like iodine schmaiadine, yeah, they're obsessed with giving you fluoride.

[1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:53.620]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Info
[1:58:53.620 --> 1:58:59.660]  Wars is being openly targeted by the Democratic party left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice
[1:58:59.660 --> 1:59:03.220]  department and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start a fight with
[1:59:03.220 --> 1:59:07.620]  them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground. And I
[1:59:07.620 --> 1:59:12.540]  knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success. But
[1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:17.460]  if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[1:59:17.460 --> 1:59:22.260]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[1:59:22.260 --> 1:59:27.540]  the word about our articles and videos info wars.com, we won't just continue to stand

[1:59:51.420 --> 2:00:08.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show one, two, one, two, three, four on the road again.
[2:00:08.860 --> 2:00:19.500]  Just can't wait to get on the road again. My love is making music with my head. I can't
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:30.500]  wait to get on the road again. On the road again. Going places that I've never been.
[2:00:30.500 --> 2:00:36.540]  Seeing things that I may never see again. I can't wait to get on the road again.
[2:00:36.540 --> 2:00:44.140]  Okay, here's what I want to do. I want to take your phone calls in the next few segments
[2:00:44.140 --> 2:00:49.140]  and I want to get you on air as quickly as we can. And then I want to go through all
[2:00:49.140 --> 2:00:53.500]  the big news that just broke in the last 30 minutes at info wars.com and news wars.com.
[2:00:53.500 --> 2:00:57.540]  In fact, I forgot to tell you guys, we print me the latest stories. Thanks. And then we're
[2:00:57.540 --> 2:01:03.820]  going to go through them all. Google drama, walkouts, protest, office harassment, inequity,
[2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:09.060]  eating their own. Clear evidence of cell phones caused cancer. Clear evidence that Fisher
[2:01:09.060 --> 2:01:12.980]  in the ocean, they really have a back end under terrorist control as us forced billions
[2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:17.060]  of the country. It's one of the few problems, but they don't want the Chinese to take over.
[2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:20.500]  I say let them have the quagmire. I think it's one of the few bad things Trump's done.
[2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:24.820]  He's not following his instinct and staying in Afghanistan. So that's just some of the
[2:01:24.820 --> 2:01:31.900]  news on that front. There's a mark dice report to that's up on info wars.com that I'm going
[2:01:31.900 --> 2:01:40.020]  to air when we come back to showing the virtue signaling, the extreme virtue signaling of
[2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:46.140]  the left. I'll just wait till next segment. My problem is I could never say it's coming
[2:01:46.140 --> 2:01:52.100]  up. I just start doing it right there, but it's, it's, it's insane. One tweet saying
[2:01:52.100 --> 2:01:58.620]  how dare you put a white person in black panther costume. That just shows the mind control
[2:01:58.620 --> 2:02:03.300]  and the anti whiteness that the establishment has promoted and is hoping minorities pick
[2:02:03.300 --> 2:02:10.180]  up. But most minorities are the majority of most areas and they were a member of Martin
[2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:14.700]  Luther King and they're like, this doesn't make sense. So, but it's a real demographic
[2:02:14.700 --> 2:02:21.620]  game the globals are playing. So that's coming up. That's coming up next segment. Also, well,
[2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:25.980]  with the US Senate panel examines former Trump aide Bannon campaign role, we're going to
[2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:30.260]  be looking at all these setups they're involved in these different TV ads they're running
[2:02:30.260 --> 2:02:35.180]  and what they plan to do if they take back to house. But I really don't think even though
[2:02:35.180 --> 2:02:40.060]  you've got record young people turning out to vote, I don't think from everything I've
[2:02:40.060 --> 2:02:45.700]  seen and what I feel and how scared and frantic the Democrats look and how they've pulled
[2:02:45.700 --> 2:02:50.420]  out all the stops and said, yes, fine, illegals vote. They'd always denied that they were
[2:02:50.420 --> 2:02:57.740]  doing that. But now they're like, yes, yes, yes, we're having illegal aliens vote. Dammit.
[2:02:57.740 --> 2:03:01.820]  And first they went from the caravans good and, you know, Trump's going to kill them
[2:03:01.820 --> 2:03:07.020]  when they get here to now. There is no caravan. I have, I have video clips. In fact, we should
[2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:13.100]  play some of these clips. I'm out of control. Where is my video list? I've got video clips
[2:03:13.100 --> 2:03:19.420]  where they're denying it exists like you have no memory. But really what they're doing is
[2:03:19.420 --> 2:03:25.660]  they're just training your brain to accept lying. So we're going to be looking at that
[2:03:25.660 --> 2:03:35.420]  coming up New York Times attacking me once fringe George Soros conspiracies new signature
[2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:47.460]  of the GOP. That's right. George Soros only gave $32 billion this year to stopping nationalist
[2:03:47.460 --> 2:03:51.500]  in Europe and the U.S. That's in the New York Times. It's like, well, the other biggest
[2:03:51.500 --> 2:03:56.140]  donors of the Koch brothers that give to both parties, but 60% Republicans, they gave $2
[2:03:56.140 --> 2:04:04.180]  billion in the last 20 years. I'm going, okay, $32 billion. $32 billion will buy a hamburger
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:13.900]  to Coke and a lot more. And I know personally, I've been told, hey, you know, let off Soros.
[2:04:13.900 --> 2:04:18.940]  He had enough yet. And I'm like, no, thank you, sir. May I have another? I have not had
[2:04:18.940 --> 2:04:25.380]  enough yet because I am not going to get down there on my knees when George Soros comes
[2:04:25.380 --> 2:04:33.740]  over and unzips his pants and worship this little piece of crap who's 88 years old and
[2:04:33.740 --> 2:04:39.900]  Satan's big, old, long, dirty tongue is like rolled out like a red carpet and George Soros
[2:04:39.900 --> 2:04:45.700]  is walking up towards the, towards the, towards the black opening. Him as little Pito Pope
[2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:50.060]  and all these people. So, hey, there's always going to be traders. There's always going
[2:04:50.060 --> 2:04:54.700]  to be people filling the role of the bad guys. Me, I'm not on that team. So whatever you
[2:04:54.700 --> 2:04:59.540]  can do to this body, the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump
[2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:04.020]  the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[2:05:04.020 --> 2:05:09.580]  that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring
[2:05:09.580 --> 2:05:15.140]  our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[2:05:15.140 --> 2:05:19.300]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source and the globalists
[2:05:19.300 --> 2:05:23.900]  tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[2:05:23.900 --> 2:05:28.660]  nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment
[2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:33.620]  trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[2:05:33.620 --> 2:05:38.300]  of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by
[2:05:38.300 --> 2:05:44.380]  combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[2:05:44.380 --> 2:05:50.340]  it and makes it even more bio available. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[2:05:50.340 --> 2:06:09.500]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:27.580]  Rising War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones. Well, the stock market's up. The Dow Jones
[2:06:27.580 --> 2:06:37.060]  industrial average, 179 points. And a lot of that, as we've seen a loss of half the
[2:06:37.060 --> 2:06:44.380]  gains we've gotten the last two years with Trump is because China and the trade war with
[2:06:44.380 --> 2:06:50.780]  the United States is getting its butt handed to it. That is the heart of evil, vampiric
[2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:58.940]  chai coms that crouch and sit and perch on top the poor Chinese people. And the word
[2:06:58.940 --> 2:07:05.620]  is, is that they're ready to capitulate. Now, we'll see if they zig when we zag, but they've
[2:07:05.620 --> 2:07:12.100]  been screwing us over and building infrastructure that is out of a science fiction movie while
[2:07:12.100 --> 2:07:20.740]  we get absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. And so Trump is just saying, you know, we're
[2:07:20.740 --> 2:07:32.740]  not going to starve America to death in some satanic leftist ritual. You know, crazy liberals
[2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:37.300]  don't just do rituals where they like sacrifice babies or rape virgins. They'll go out to
[2:07:37.300 --> 2:07:42.540]  some beautiful redwood and they'll cut it down and burn it in a ritual. That's been
[2:07:42.540 --> 2:07:47.220]  in the news before. They live to get the essence of some, you know, a thousand year old tree.
[2:07:47.220 --> 2:07:51.380]  These people are crazy. Donald Trump doesn't need to chop a tree down to get some power.
[2:07:51.380 --> 2:08:00.780]  It's not a mental patient. So the Shanghai composite stock index is going right in the
[2:08:00.780 --> 2:08:10.580]  toilet. They've had about four times the losses we have. So they want to fight. They got one
[2:08:10.580 --> 2:08:14.460]  because Donald Trump just doesn't get as a businessman. Why don't we negotiate a two
[2:08:14.460 --> 2:08:19.460]  way deal that makes everybody rich? Why? Why are we screwing America over? Oh, because
[2:08:19.460 --> 2:08:26.380]  the left has some weird anti Christian thing. And just wants to, I mean, you look at Hollywood,
[2:08:26.380 --> 2:08:29.980]  like why does Hollywood hate America? Why do they hate John Wayne? Why do they hate men
[2:08:29.980 --> 2:08:45.140]  being men? Why? Because they hate power. They're threat. They don't have it. Why do the globalists
[2:08:45.140 --> 2:08:58.820]  want total control of Russia? Because Russia for all its problems has high IQ and probably
[2:08:58.820 --> 2:09:04.020]  a lot. The establishment thinks of the touch, maybe some psychic genetics. That's the same
[2:09:04.020 --> 2:09:09.540]  thing. Anything that's got power, the globalists want to control. And everybody's like, yeah,
[2:09:09.540 --> 2:09:13.060]  tell us something we don't know. I'm not talking to the audience that knows everything. I know
[2:09:13.060 --> 2:09:19.420]  you know everything. I'm always worried about the prodigal son, the person that doesn't know.
[2:09:19.420 --> 2:09:25.020]  That's who we need to get. Now they're total idiots and scum move on from them, but we
[2:09:25.020 --> 2:09:34.740]  got to reach out to them. I think the selection at a gut level is on a razor's edge. I think
[2:09:34.740 --> 2:09:42.820]  it's going to come in super whoever wins is going to be super, super close. Razor's margins
[2:09:42.820 --> 2:09:47.900]  wins by a nose. Obviously, it's a huge red wave like it is globally, but there's going
[2:09:47.900 --> 2:09:57.740]  to be fraud. And so we've got to do even more to win. And if listeners don't get energized,
[2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:06.700]  which you are, and if you don't go out and really take action, we still win. But it's
[2:10:06.700 --> 2:10:14.300]  it's going to be rough. In fact, we might even win more spectacularly down the road.
[2:10:14.300 --> 2:10:22.060]  I just man, I really don't want to go down that road. Just the flesh in me would like
[2:10:22.060 --> 2:10:27.780]  to really, really secure this and drive the Democrats from power and really make them
[2:10:27.780 --> 2:10:32.780]  the regional party and really make them extinct politically. That's the right thing to do.
[2:10:32.780 --> 2:10:43.500]  The right thing to do is press the attack. We're going to play this Trump video coming
[2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:48.580]  up. Let me give you the number to join us on who do you think is going to win? What's
[2:10:48.580 --> 2:10:51.740]  your gut tell you? What are you seeing? What do you make of the fake polls saying Democrats
[2:10:51.740 --> 2:10:55.020]  are going to win? We've seen that before. We know they're over sampling 10, 15 percent
[2:10:55.020 --> 2:10:58.460]  depending on the poll for Democrats. What do you see in your tea leaves? And let's get
[2:10:58.460 --> 2:11:05.060]  to this first. This is a story up on info wars.com is extremely important. Mark Dice has done
[2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:13.700]  it again. He sent a tweet to target saying, I can't believe you have a white child in
[2:11:13.700 --> 2:11:21.460]  a black panther outfit. This is cultural appropriation. Black folks finally get a hero and you've
[2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:26.020]  done this. There's actual tweet. Why is this white boy pictured wearing a black panther
[2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:33.100]  costume on your website? This is black erasure. This is what's total university, by the way.
[2:11:33.100 --> 2:11:37.820]  People of color finally have a superhero of their own and you just respect them by using
[2:11:37.820 --> 2:11:44.220]  a white person to promote the costume. Shameful, I'm boycotting. And they pulled it with one
[2:11:44.220 --> 2:11:49.100]  tweet and people thought it was real. Even though it's Mark Dice, you know, in 10 seconds
[2:11:49.100 --> 2:11:57.460]  he's a conservative libertarian media analyst. Par excellence. But again, it shows the capitulation.
[2:11:57.460 --> 2:12:00.900]  The left is the most susceptible to their own mental illness where you're just supposed
[2:12:00.900 --> 2:12:06.740]  to absolutely capitulate. If someone says milk is racist, we go, no, it's not BuzzFeed.
[2:12:06.740 --> 2:12:12.540]  He says, yes, it's white. It's racist. They're teaching total mental illness. Here's the
[2:12:12.540 --> 2:12:18.940]  report. Well, not everyone had a happy Halloween this year. Target America's second biggest
[2:12:18.940 --> 2:12:25.860]  retailer took down this photo of a white boy modeling a black panther superhero costume.
[2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:31.140]  Someone complained that it's a costume for black children and it's cultural appropriation.
[2:12:31.140 --> 2:12:35.620]  How dare you think it's okay for a white boy to dress up as a black superhero? What do
[2:12:35.620 --> 2:12:40.940]  you think this is, the 1990s? And you're never going to guess who complained about it. I
[2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:45.340]  did. When it was brought to my attention last week by one of you awesome viewers that the
[2:12:45.340 --> 2:12:50.580]  white boy was pictured wearing the costume, I did my best social justice warrior impression
[2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:55.700]  and tweeted the target telling them how terrible it was. Why is this white boy pictured wearing
[2:12:55.700 --> 2:13:02.420]  a black panther costume on your website? This is black eraser. People of color finally
[2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:07.620]  have a superhero on their own. And you disrespect them by using a white person to promote the
[2:13:07.620 --> 2:13:14.020]  costume. Shameful. Boycott. And then added, I didn't mean to assume the child's gender.
[2:13:14.020 --> 2:13:19.380]  The point is that a white boy or girl or non binary or questioning or gender fluid, pen,
[2:13:19.380 --> 2:13:25.420]  gender queer, intersex individual has no business modeling a black panther costume.
[2:13:25.420 --> 2:13:29.380]  Path tag black lonely. And even though they didn't apologize, which is what I was hoping
[2:13:29.380 --> 2:13:34.420]  they would do when I checked the website yesterday, the photo of the white boy was gone and every
[2:13:34.420 --> 2:13:39.660]  single picture is a black kid modeling the costume. Now, if you thought that my liberal
[2:13:39.660 --> 2:13:44.180]  alter ego was the only one crazy enough to think that this was an inappropriate costume
[2:13:44.180 --> 2:13:50.420]  for kids, you would be wrong. This from People Magazine, cultural appropriation or not, parents
[2:13:50.420 --> 2:13:54.980]  speak out about black panther Halloween costumes. Parents of white children might want to think
[2:13:54.980 --> 2:14:00.260]  twice before purchasing a black panther Halloween costume this year. The blockbuster superhero
[2:14:00.260 --> 2:14:05.300]  film is sure to spawn some of the most popular getups this season. But many are advising
[2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:11.180]  parents to consider all angles before giving into their children's wishes, namely exploring
[2:14:11.180 --> 2:14:16.580]  the idea of whether a white child dressing up as any of the film's black characters
[2:14:16.580 --> 2:14:21.540]  would be considered cultural appropriation. Evan Narcy, the senior writer for I09, who's
[2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:26.220]  currently working on a comic series titled Rise of the Black Panther for Marvel, told
[2:14:26.220 --> 2:14:31.220]  The New York Times he feels conflicted about the issue. You want that white kid to be able
[2:14:31.220 --> 2:14:36.100]  to think that he can dress up in a black panther costume? Because to that kid, there's no difference
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:41.380]  between Captain America and black panther, he said, explaining that it also requires
[2:14:41.380 --> 2:14:47.700]  trying to explain what is special about T'Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it's like,
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:53.380]  I can't do it. I couldn't do it. Seven months ago, anticipating this problem, this black
[2:14:53.380 --> 2:14:59.380]  man tweeted out, Dear white people, yes, black panther came to cinemas in February. So yes,
[2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:05.140]  this Halloween will be prime time for black panther costumes. Please note, there are white
[2:15:05.140 --> 2:15:10.260]  characters in black panther for you. He went on to say that the point is that white people
[2:15:10.260 --> 2:15:16.020]  have many choices when it comes to who they can accurately portray. The black and brown
[2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:23.220]  people do not. So why encroach on their territory? Another blogger and podcaster for fatherly.com
[2:15:23.220 --> 2:15:29.940]  wrote, quote, I don't think my white son should wear a black panther costume this Halloween.
[2:15:29.940 --> 2:15:36.020]  In general, I don't think white children should wear black panther costumes for Halloween at all.
[2:15:36.020 --> 2:15:42.420]  My thinking is this, black panther is more than just another superhero film. It is a meaningful
[2:15:42.420 --> 2:15:48.740]  and important moment for people of a specific race. It's people like you, sir, who are ruining
[2:15:48.740 --> 2:16:14.740]  the next generation and possibly the entire country.

[2:20:22.820 --> 2:20:27.140]  our pen on the wars we fight
[2:20:27.140 --> 2:20:34.340]  driving about the way things ought to be I don't mind them and I don't mind them switching sides
[2:20:34.340 --> 2:20:42.020]  and standing up for things they believe in but when they're running down our country they're
[2:20:42.020 --> 2:20:50.020]  walking on the fighting side of me there's a fighting side now isn't it?
[2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:57.220]  running down a way of life our fighting men have fought and died to be

[2:21:09.700 --> 2:21:13.300]  the election what's your gut level or what do you think if they're gonna have this caravan
[2:21:13.300 --> 2:21:18.820]  hitting in just a few days before the election only five days out total false flag territory
[2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:24.100]  where do you think it's all going and any other issue long-time callers first-time callers whatever
[2:21:24.100 --> 2:21:30.900]  I'd love to hear from you all 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 I don't want to be rude I mean a little bit
[2:21:30.900 --> 2:21:35.220]  better going to callers quicker but to get to a lot of yet we need to just have 45 seconds a
[2:21:35.220 --> 2:21:40.420]  minute a piece and I can't pontificate which is like asking water not to be wet but I'll try
[2:21:41.700 --> 2:21:48.340]  877-789 alex 877-789-2539 on this live Thursday global transmission
[2:21:48.340 --> 2:21:53.620]  now let's get into it right now let's talk about it
[2:22:00.420 --> 2:22:08.900]  let's go ahead and discuss the topic of what is homosexual in Latin
[2:22:08.900 --> 2:22:17.300]  and then what is frog or amphibian in latin can we look that up because this would be the case of
[2:22:20.020 --> 2:22:26.580]  frogus homosexual us I mean I guess is what you would call it
[2:22:27.700 --> 2:22:33.060]  and we're gonna go to this moment now why am I doing something funny well because
[2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:39.460]  we can reach a lot of young people with these memes these tried and trusted memes
[2:22:40.100 --> 2:22:46.260]  so the alex jones comes out as a gay frog is on info wars.com you can share the video it's the
[2:22:46.260 --> 2:22:51.860]  only way it gets out to people and it's tailor-made with one of the number one memes I mean it's up
[2:22:51.860 --> 2:22:57.700]  there in the top view memes ever gay frogs and people can find out wow atrazine really does
[2:22:57.700 --> 2:23:02.020]  sterilize you it really can manipulate your sexuality and it's a big problem and people
[2:23:02.020 --> 2:23:10.900]  should be aware of what's going on so I thought that a gay frog a fictitious character played by me
[2:23:10.900 --> 2:23:17.140]  would then talk to mr. atrazine another real character who actually is out sterilizing and
[2:23:17.140 --> 2:23:22.500]  killing the frogs and causing male frogs to be homosexual and female frogs not even produce
[2:23:22.500 --> 2:23:30.820]  eggs it just it just kills you just and turns you upside down so here is the the report and this is
[2:23:30.820 --> 2:23:35.620]  the gay frog report for the election it's very very important it's on info wars.com here it is
[2:23:35.620 --> 2:23:55.220]  welcome to lily pad lane and here's your host geronimo frost
[2:24:06.020 --> 2:24:12.100]  atrazine thanks to atrazine don't be no more frogs but we're gay so it's cool thanks atrazine
[2:24:13.140 --> 2:24:14.980]  atrazine is a human sterilization agent
[2:24:18.260 --> 2:24:22.580]  before we go to our special guest atrazine I wanted you to hear from one of our biggest
[2:24:22.580 --> 2:24:28.500]  supporters david hog he understands the bigoted anti-semitic racist hatred of people like alex
[2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:33.940]  jones that have warned that frogs becoming sterilized and gay for major scientific studies of course
[2:24:33.940 --> 2:24:41.140]  we are it's so cool let's hear from david hog first i'm david getting um saying alex
[2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:46.660]  sorry I don't want to mention his name um when individuals say these things to us I think it's
[2:24:46.660 --> 2:24:50.020]  important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make money off them for
[2:24:50.020 --> 2:24:54.100]  example one of the main people in the situation that I don't want to name the name of but as you
[2:24:54.100 --> 2:24:58.900]  said it's from info wars um he shouts a lot I'll just give you that and he looks red um
[2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:05.540]  um he's advertising many of these things and the power lies in these advertisers to pull out of
[2:25:05.540 --> 2:25:10.820]  these fear mongering hate loving people that just want to spread hate and division in America
[2:25:10.820 --> 2:25:15.620]  for example on info wars one of the main things that he's but one of his famous things is saying
[2:25:15.620 --> 2:25:20.580]  that uh one of his most famous statements was saying that topwater is turning the frogs gay and
[2:25:20.580 --> 2:25:25.140]  will turn you gay too first off gay people are awesome I don't think that's a problem at all
[2:25:25.140 --> 2:25:33.460]  and secondly if you notice at the end of that video he advertises water filters interesting thank you
[2:25:33.460 --> 2:25:45.140]  david thank you alex does bad gay frogs good aphrodisiac good I have a I have trouble breathing
[2:25:45.140 --> 2:25:50.820]  in they say I'm gonna die soon but it's okay aphrodisiac I love you let's talk to aphrodisiac
[2:25:50.820 --> 2:26:05.860]  oh yes you've taken the bait okay well we'll go to you now then oh my god you still are wonderful
[2:26:05.860 --> 2:26:11.060]  okay what why are they lying about you and saying mean things about you and trying to keep you from
[2:26:11.060 --> 2:26:16.260]  the human children's water after all you give people such gifts why are they doing that mr
[2:26:16.260 --> 2:26:23.620]  aphrodisiac of course my son you're absolutely right there's nothing wrong with aphrodisiac
[2:26:24.260 --> 2:26:32.500]  and other carcinogens in the water to give you this gift that you now have a gift that's so
[2:26:32.500 --> 2:26:42.820]  special a gift that means the end of the frogs yes you are a product of collateral damage
[2:26:42.820 --> 2:26:49.860]  in a larger program and the fact that Stephen Colbert and my other agents have turned this
[2:26:49.860 --> 2:26:56.420]  into a joke is all the more delicious atrazine is what helps us become sterile and die it's liberal
[2:26:56.420 --> 2:27:02.580]  and don't be racist against atrazine ask any gay frog it's good to never have any more frogs
[2:27:02.580 --> 2:27:09.460]  it's good for us being seen to go away or your races I'm so cool now mr atrazine that I'm sterile
[2:27:09.460 --> 2:27:15.380]  and dying early and have four eyes but there's bigots out there who fight the transhumanist
[2:27:15.380 --> 2:27:20.740]  trans system and they say that the mutations are bad and that we should worry about deadly
[2:27:20.740 --> 2:27:26.740]  chemicals or sterilization why do they do that why are they against the gifts you've given us
[2:27:26.740 --> 2:27:35.220]  of after they every human watching not just frogs not just other animal life needs to know
[2:27:35.220 --> 2:27:40.100]  oh when I was first born I was saw my dad he had a big red neck he'll
[2:27:42.420 --> 2:27:46.660]  never filter your water cook with bisphenol a
[2:27:49.300 --> 2:27:56.020]  radiation is good for you the world government is good for you just submit

[2:34:01.380 --> 2:34:06.660]  information to cover a lot of new breaking news obviously around the country they're claiming
[2:34:06.660 --> 2:34:11.780]  these races are extremely close and i would tend to disagree with that because the polling is is
[2:34:11.780 --> 2:34:22.420]  historically so fake but you do have record record record turnout right now of young people
[2:34:23.460 --> 2:34:30.340]  and it's true that half of millennials call themselves communists or socialists in major polls
[2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:39.540]  but most generation z so i guess that's about under what's generation z under 20
[2:34:41.540 --> 2:34:47.140]  generation z or i guess under 18 generation z is is mainly libertarian or conservative
[2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:54.660]  but there is a 500 increase in texas
[2:34:54.660 --> 2:35:00.260]  of people who are millennial

[2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:49.300]  you're somebody but he's like uh chris kwomo he's a hit and run guy so you've got a hit and run
[2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:54.660]  under your belt you're either going to be a democrat president commentator or senator
[2:35:56.420 --> 2:36:00.820]  i don't know what are the here's a question for listeners what do the democrats do if they
[2:36:00.820 --> 2:36:09.300]  win going insane job all these committees and try to sabotage the economy we know what the
[2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:14.660]  fellow reserves are already up to what do they do they lose oh my gosh i think you're gonna see
[2:36:14.660 --> 2:36:20.180]  riots all over the country and they'd plan to send up the caravan see here's let me tell you what
[2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:27.940]  happened with the caravan obama began with just like they did in europe six seven years ago they
[2:36:27.940 --> 2:36:37.540]  began six seven years ago to send up giant caravans of people paid for by soros by taxpayers by the
[2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:44.180]  un and hundreds of buses a day would arrive just in mcallin texas show starting like five years ago
[2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:48.900]  we had took us about a year to learn about it nobody was even talking about it we would send our
[2:36:48.900 --> 2:36:53.860]  crew down to mcallin other places and there'd be like 20 buses at a time driving off and and four
[2:36:53.860 --> 2:37:00.580]  or five rounds a day and the board of patrol would actually have their union head because he could
[2:37:00.580 --> 2:37:04.660]  speak who also that was the head of the texas sector ago it's treason we can't even vet them
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:09.860]  they have diseases we're being told to load kids up on buses with people we even know our group
[2:37:09.860 --> 2:37:14.340]  started with certified this is child trafficking which it was later came out you know like wow
[2:37:14.340 --> 2:37:19.940]  the board patrol really went far in doing that well yeah i mean when you're like wanted to
[2:37:19.940 --> 2:37:23.780]  help children and people you're loading them up with adults you don't even know who they are
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:30.900]  and it turned out it was child smuggling and a bunch of the crap and then once they get these
[2:37:30.900 --> 2:37:35.460]  bus loads to chicago and dallas and everywhere else are going from texas and oklahoma city
[2:37:35.460 --> 2:37:40.500]  they go to democrat charities they sign the kit up and the local church local democratic group
[2:37:40.500 --> 2:37:51.140]  skims in some cases 100 percent of the welfare but it gets worse it's in the news that they then put
[2:37:51.140 --> 2:37:57.620]  them even child laborers in factories owned by democrats meatpacking you name it corrupt democrat
[2:37:57.620 --> 2:38:01.460]  towns they run where they run the inspectors they run everybody else is totally corrupt
[2:38:03.380 --> 2:38:06.980]  and they make them work and then when it's time to get their paycheck
[2:38:06.980 --> 2:38:10.100]  if they bitch they're fired
[2:38:12.820 --> 2:38:20.260]  and if they say anything they blow a whistle and report them to ice and then ice comes and gets
[2:38:20.260 --> 2:38:23.060]  them you think ice likes doing that
[2:38:25.940 --> 2:38:29.860]  go into some dirty apartment where there's a bunch of teenagers and people and there's
[2:38:29.860 --> 2:38:33.540]  everything else going on and you know there's girls be proven prostitution in the back room
[2:38:33.540 --> 2:38:38.100]  just to pay for the rent and all the money skimmed off hub there's a pimp running them for sex
[2:38:38.100 --> 2:38:43.860]  democrats are getting all the welfare money and then they don't even give them a paycheck at the
[2:38:43.860 --> 2:38:51.700]  meatpacking plant some 15 year old girl ice gets really pissed and they say we're quitting unless
[2:38:51.700 --> 2:39:03.060]  somebody does something about this and so trump he's done a lot of stuff behind the scenes let's
[2:39:03.060 --> 2:39:08.340]  just say these king pens mexican mafia ms-13 because the democrats don't like to get their
[2:39:08.340 --> 2:39:14.980]  hands dirty because see sometimes the hispanic particularly uh coming here legally they get
[2:39:14.980 --> 2:39:19.700]  organized kind of in a union and say no well then they just send in a gang and kill them
[2:39:20.580 --> 2:39:27.540]  and that's why Nancy Pelosi said they're all god's children we'll see then ms-13
[2:39:27.540 --> 2:39:35.060]  they got guns on them and a lot of times you know they pull those guns
[2:39:36.340 --> 2:39:41.140]  and then it just kind of comes a footnote when these guys get laid out and it's not a good thing
[2:39:41.140 --> 2:39:46.260]  i don't like it but we are in basically the civil war you don't usually even hear about these guys
[2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:50.660]  what happens to them and they're real scared right now they've been running their mouth out
[2:39:50.660 --> 2:39:53.700]  of tough there and everything else but they're they're not tough they're dead what they are
[2:39:53.700 --> 2:39:58.580]  they're six feet under they're getting chewed up and spat out
[2:40:03.220 --> 2:40:05.620]  because we're not going to turn the united states into mexico
[2:40:06.740 --> 2:40:11.860]  we're not going to go on the globalist model it's not going to happen so
[2:40:13.860 --> 2:40:20.340]  that's what's happening and that's just one small little window into all the things that
[2:40:20.340 --> 2:40:27.140]  are going on what are they going to pull what are they going to pull with these huge mobs of
[2:40:27.140 --> 2:40:34.900]  10 000 here 20 000 there 5 000 here 3 000 there marching up to crush the border so so i knew
[2:40:36.420 --> 2:40:40.820]  this was going on because we knew they were bringing up buses we knew the groups where Soros
[2:40:40.820 --> 2:40:45.700]  was in forbs bragging he was funding and and and and you know the un and trump gets in he says
[2:40:45.700 --> 2:40:51.460]  we're not under un control anymore controlling those agencies we're in control it stops and Soros
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:56.020]  goes no we're just going to make even bigger caravans and smash through it and say you're
[2:40:56.020 --> 2:41:00.900]  hurting little kids and have the compliant media say it but the public woke up to that so now they're
[2:41:00.900 --> 2:41:05.620]  in real trouble so they're like oh my god this this caravan backfired on us what are we going to
[2:41:05.620 --> 2:41:12.260]  do so now they're in the news saying the caravans do not exist that's in my stack they just think
[2:41:12.260 --> 2:41:17.780]  you'll just forget about that caravan now because see we've warned of false flags we've warned of
[2:41:17.780 --> 2:41:22.900]  what they might pull they know there's too many eyeballs and military intelligence defense
[2:41:22.900 --> 2:41:28.900]  intelligence army intelligence the marine corps the patriots that are in the cia not the bad ones
[2:41:28.900 --> 2:41:33.860]  they're all down there watching and they're all tracking the leaders of this and i bet some of
[2:41:33.860 --> 2:41:37.780]  the leaders the caravan from these ngos they're involved in a military action against the us
[2:41:37.780 --> 2:41:43.780]  because i bet some of them fell down the stairs in mexico in the last few days why i bet a few
[2:41:43.780 --> 2:41:52.500]  of them got ran into on the street g donnet durnit i bet some of them died with their
[2:41:52.500 --> 2:41:58.900]  military attack on the us i bet the heads of the snakes got cut off because that's what
[2:41:58.900 --> 2:42:03.620]  they're saying now suddenly there's like the leaders are all gone nobody knows where they went
[2:42:03.620 --> 2:42:10.660]  they just disappeared it's really sad that all these communists organized in venezuela
[2:42:10.660 --> 2:42:14.740]  marched up from their waving communist flags and their foreign flags so they're gonna piss all over
[2:42:14.740 --> 2:42:19.380]  the country i'm real sad to hear that soros is a little minions and some of these even some of
[2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:24.500]  these liberal professors that are you know basically foreign intelligence officers i'm i'm upset
[2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:29.460]  i'm upset that some of them might have like Humpty Dumpty fell down and busted their head and
[2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:35.460]  all the king's horses and all the king's men i'll never put them back together again what about

[2:43:55.220 --> 2:44:00.660]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[2:44:00.660 --> 2:44:06.020]  leilanias states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned
[2:44:06.020 --> 2:44:13.140]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[2:44:13.140 --> 2:44:19.220]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy
[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:25.380]  metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[2:44:25.380 --> 2:44:31.780]  metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[2:44:31.780 --> 2:44:37.620]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to
[2:44:37.620 --> 2:44:44.740]  optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[2:44:44.740 --> 2:44:51.300]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly

[2:47:46.820 --> 2:47:52.100]  the way they're rooting against the country just the energy they're putting out to not just have
[2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:58.100]  control but to run it in the ground they're not fighting like you fight for your baby's life
[2:47:58.660 --> 2:48:02.180]  because you love it they're fighting because they want to crap all over it

[2:48:10.100 --> 2:48:16.580]  such a thug that it gives me a headache to even like like if i want to start talking trash about her
[2:48:16.580 --> 2:48:21.220]  they just showed a clip of her if you're watching tv radio listeners didn't see it and i started
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:25.220]  thinking about all the stuff she's done bad and how evil she is now she rips off her constituents
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:34.420]  and steals their welfare money and i mean she is a cremo and that's what america has with a big old
[2:48:34.420 --> 2:48:44.900]  giant hard on to screw us over i mean it's like god almighty thank god god put term limits on people

[2:49:02.100 --> 2:49:07.620]  well i think about all the crimes she i mean she had no money when she went to congress she's given
[2:49:07.620 --> 2:49:11.700]  billions to her husband in government biotech money but they get away with it because they're
[2:49:11.700 --> 2:49:17.060]  democrats because they buy everybody off okay i said i go to your calls i just where do you start
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:23.140]  where do you start with these people nancy polosi ms-13's all god's children well they're
[2:49:23.140 --> 2:49:28.420]  certainly going to see god right now i heard they've not been having a very good day
[2:49:28.420 --> 2:49:36.340]  of course that isn't on your local action seven news though and people go oh my god

[2:49:40.180 --> 2:49:46.260]  governments attacking us in covert operations they're lucky that trump doesn't fly down there
[2:49:46.260 --> 2:49:53.220]  with a ten war dogs and destroy those columns but they have children with them they bring them as
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:58.900]  shields and you let them through it's the very groups exploiting kids most those kids they've
[2:49:58.900 --> 2:50:02.340]  kidnapped you look at those kids crying and screaming trying to get away with from who
[2:50:02.340 --> 2:50:07.540]  they're with those aren't their fathers and mothers in most cases those are child traffickers it's on
[2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:14.340]  record so i say we go down there and judiciously remove the children from them find who their
[2:50:14.340 --> 2:50:19.140]  parents are oh you can't do that that's taking a child away next time they catch some pedophile
[2:50:19.140 --> 2:50:25.620]  with a van full of kids don't take my kids away on the news the local police caught a known pedophile
[2:50:25.620 --> 2:50:29.860]  with six kidnapped kids but they show you said it's wrong because they they found out who the
[2:50:29.860 --> 2:50:35.940]  kids are and separated them that's right these are all my kids some fat white guys like little
[2:50:35.940 --> 2:50:40.260]  black kids usually is minority kids because they seem to think nobody cares about them those are

[2:51:36.740 --> 2:51:42.100]  but i've noticed a trend and there's this false confidence of the democrats again the same thing
[2:51:42.100 --> 2:51:49.380]  we saw in the 2016 election and now we see adam shift maxine waters nancy polosi they're all licking
[2:51:49.380 --> 2:51:54.340]  their lips thinking they're going to take back the house and they vowed investigations into what
[2:51:54.340 --> 2:51:59.700]  they and why they lost so it's up to us to counter the narrative and to counter their lies and on
[2:51:59.700 --> 2:52:05.540]  one way i deal it is with my youtube page but also it's through your t-shirts and your hats alex
[2:52:05.540 --> 2:52:12.100]  i want to promote your t-shirt everyone out there they are great ways to meet people who have like
[2:52:12.100 --> 2:52:17.700]  minds and they start conversations and you find patriots and it's a great way to spread good
[2:52:17.700 --> 2:52:23.140]  messages out there so i highly recommend it alex oh absolutely when i say these these shirts are
[2:52:23.140 --> 2:52:27.140]  like shoes you're on adventure wear a mo on lombay you'll only meet fellow patriots and

[3:00:40.900 --> 3:00:47.460]  but the fact that we've gotten the globalists to really show who they are is the victory
[3:00:48.500 --> 3:00:52.340]  we're going to go through some battles some are going to win some are going to lose
[3:00:52.340 --> 3:00:56.100]  but really it's about getting our soul back and that's what matters mike adams is coming in to

[3:01:17.460 --> 3:01:22.500]  talking about america coming back oh my you think that's ridiculous the left will promote it and
[3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:26.580]  believe it because they have a real blind sights that's why the most successful people on twitter
[3:01:26.580 --> 3:01:31.300]  are real sarcastic and i'm like that's screwed to another dad gary with the u.s stock market up
[3:01:31.300 --> 3:01:36.900]  the left goes i agree screw him i hate america you have to understand how mentally captured they are
[3:01:38.660 --> 3:01:44.100]  so we're gonna cover all that tim you're making a good point though about i thought this a few
[3:01:44.100 --> 3:01:47.700]  months ago i didn't say it on air but you just said i remembered it which which shows
[3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:57.540]  right minds think alike polosi more moeller hillary maxine waters they're all these macabre like
[3:01:57.540 --> 3:02:04.420]  ventriloquist dummy chucky dolls that never go away and they're hurting the party but they won't
[3:02:04.420 --> 3:02:09.700]  turn loose of power there's even worse socialist and scum behind them but we know these evil people
[3:02:10.980 --> 3:02:16.660]  and so yes that's in the cards too not just attack the the the illegal alien caravan the
[3:02:16.660 --> 3:02:22.500]  u and caravan but also take out one of these turds right before the election and blame trump
[3:02:22.500 --> 3:02:26.180]  five days out we've already seen stuff that looks like false flags what do you think they would do
[3:02:27.540 --> 3:02:32.100]  i think they'll do anything i think they'll take out one of those pawns you know the useful idiots
[3:02:32.100 --> 3:02:37.940]  that they that they are um because they are there they're walking liability for them and i i don't
[3:02:37.940 --> 3:02:44.180]  put anything past again in montana i received a flyer uh supporting a libertarian candidate for
[3:02:44.180 --> 3:02:50.180]  senate and uh he did not put that out he doesn't have the funds to put that out exactly libertarian
[3:02:50.180 --> 3:02:55.060]  ideas are great but let's face it the libertarian party are the ones that continue to let the
[3:02:55.060 --> 3:03:01.620]  democrats win so so again the democrats are backing libertarians now and he came out and
[3:03:01.620 --> 3:03:08.580]  has endorsed matt rosendale who is also uh uh ran paul was here in montana over the weekend
[3:03:08.580 --> 3:03:14.740]  dumping for matt rosendale and and the libertarian candidate came out and said if you're libertarian
[3:03:14.740 --> 3:03:20.020]  vote for rosendale vote republican otherwise you're gonna let the democrats win again and
[3:03:20.020 --> 3:03:26.020]  and he's he says i do not want to be a distraction well exactly let's be clear the libertarian idea
[3:03:26.020 --> 3:03:31.620]  that is taking over the republicans so now the libertarian vehicle is done and now libertarian
[3:03:31.620 --> 3:03:36.740]  leaders at the national party are democrats they are they used to be good they're total democrats
[3:03:36.740 --> 3:03:40.500]  now and they've been caught getting funded by them you're i'm glad you raised that because
[3:03:40.500 --> 3:03:44.900]  i wanted to do a whole hour a few weeks ago i forgot so that's what collars are so great
[3:03:44.900 --> 3:03:49.220]  to really go after the democratic party and their little stepchild that's been the siphon
[3:03:49.220 --> 3:03:53.220]  on republican votes like you which is libertarians you know they're gonna try to take down trump
[3:03:53.220 --> 3:03:58.340]  in a year and a half in the middle they're gonna run a major third party candidate as a democrat
[3:03:59.300 --> 3:04:02.980]  that yeah they're gonna they're gonna try to get somebody that they claim is an independent
[3:04:02.980 --> 3:04:08.900]  and they're just gonna be a puppet for george soros as usual and you know it's uh when it comes
[3:04:08.900 --> 3:04:14.340]  to when it comes to all their schemes and all their censorship alex is um you know i heard a
[3:04:14.340 --> 3:04:20.340]  quote one time i just every time i hear you on the radio which is every day um i think of this
[3:04:20.340 --> 3:04:24.980]  quote that they it's the tighter you squeeze the less you have the tighter they squeeze you the
[3:04:24.980 --> 3:04:29.540]  less they're gonna have in the palm of their hand when they're done and well exactly gently
[3:04:29.540 --> 3:04:36.180]  you're gently catchy monkey and oh it's just quite a battle god bless you great points all right

[3:04:42.820 --> 3:04:49.300]  rampage through those mike adams is coming in news wars dot com info wars dot com natural news dot com
[3:04:53.860 --> 3:04:58.260]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[3:04:58.260 --> 3:05:03.700]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[3:05:04.260 --> 3:05:09.380]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[3:05:09.380 --> 3:05:15.460]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[3:05:15.460 --> 3:05:19.940]  but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[3:05:19.940 --> 3:05:25.940]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to
[3:05:25.940 --> 3:05:30.900]  the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth
[3:05:30.900 --> 3:05:36.820]  crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[3:05:36.820 --> 3:05:43.780]  it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it even
[3:05:43.780 --> 3:05:49.700]  more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible
[3:05:49.700 --> 3:05:56.980]  discovery x3 now available at m4's live dot com
[3:06:07.220 --> 3:06:11.060]  this is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of texas the u.s. resistance
[3:06:11.060 --> 3:06:15.380]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist china ally with the

[3:07:51.540 --> 3:07:55.460]  destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming and out as much
[3:07:55.460 --> 3:08:01.780]  as i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical
[3:08:01.780 --> 3:08:07.300]  deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being
[3:08:07.300 --> 3:08:12.580]  sincere build me into an insincere person in the straw man i'm a person that cares about life and
[3:08:12.580 --> 3:08:17.060]  children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me
[3:08:17.060 --> 3:08:22.180]  into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a
[3:08:22.180 --> 3:08:28.340]  debate about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to
[3:08:28.340 --> 3:08:34.660]  serve them by being the main distraction i am now been captured by the enemy in the information
[3:08:34.660 --> 3:08:40.100]  warfare fulcrum has been used against you only your full understanding of this tea will break
[3:08:40.100 --> 3:08:45.060]  you free from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free
[3:08:48.660 --> 3:08:56.020]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[3:08:56.020 --> 3:09:05.300]  the mind of man thomas jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:09:05.300 --> 3:09:13.060]  austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones you know i could see for a long way and
[3:09:13.060 --> 3:09:19.460]  soak in our listeners and soak in my gathams i'm gonna take a few calls and let him take over
[3:09:19.460 --> 3:09:22.660]  i appreciate him coming in to guest us today and i apologize for running over but i promise to
[3:09:22.660 --> 3:09:29.380]  your calls but mike you know foresight can be distorted because
[3:09:32.420 --> 3:09:36.900]  you have a vision or you have an understanding of your subconscious prayers hundreds of times
[3:09:36.900 --> 3:09:41.540]  were powerful in the conscious mind and then you but then your conscious mind thinks it knows how
[3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:45.620]  to read that map and then it's actually something else down the road and then you start as you get
[3:09:45.620 --> 3:09:50.820]  older seeing how god works and then the whole mystery of the world gut level spiritually
[3:09:50.820 --> 3:09:55.220]  i feel that evil is being continued with worldwide good is beginning to wake up
[3:09:55.220 --> 3:10:00.100]  and you've got nationalists being elected that are real patriots in brazil and in italy and in
[3:10:00.100 --> 3:10:04.420]  england just all over merkel's been voted out but that's like barely even in the news she's
[3:10:04.420 --> 3:10:08.180]  still the chancellor but her party's out of power that's how their system works so it's it's it's
[3:10:08.180 --> 3:10:14.580]  total lame duck to duck with no legs and no beak and just basically a dead duck politically before
[3:10:14.580 --> 3:10:20.420]  they say i'm saying kill merkel so if you sit back and look at this i feel good about what's
[3:10:20.420 --> 3:10:24.820]  happening because the awakening and maybe that distorts what what happens next tuesday on the
[3:10:24.820 --> 3:10:29.460]  sixth four and a half days down and yeah they have a record level young people vote and the
[3:10:29.460 --> 3:10:36.340]  actuary show that 60 or 70 percent are democrats so that that that that could deliver with all the
[3:10:36.340 --> 3:10:41.700]  dead people voting the zombie army of the democrats that could deliver them victory um but but then
[3:10:41.700 --> 3:10:45.940]  that'll unravel as they try to sabotage the economy they get the blame that get trump
[3:10:45.940 --> 3:10:50.660]  reelected but they may kill him by then plus they've announced this jihad this is about power
[3:10:51.940 --> 3:10:58.020]  and so you've got not some negative it's good to look on the dark side to understand what the
[3:10:58.020 --> 3:11:02.580]  possibilities are in five days and what they'll do you see some things that he leaves i think that
[3:11:02.580 --> 3:11:09.060]  matt drudge is seeing as well that uh are are are very very foreboding well i i agree with you that
[3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:14.500]  this global awakening is very important and it is accelerating but at the same time it's also
[3:11:14.500 --> 3:11:19.700]  awakened the the deepening evil of those who are authoritarians and who are trying to crush
[3:11:19.700 --> 3:11:24.900]  human freedom and crush human consciousness and global liberty and some of the things that that
[3:11:24.900 --> 3:11:30.340]  i'm really concerned about right now alex are that this you know next tuesday the election is not i
[3:11:30.340 --> 3:11:35.780]  would not at this point consider it to be a fair and free election oh it's not because the the election
[3:11:35.780 --> 3:11:40.660]  meddling google bragging they're going to deliver it absolutely the tech giants have committed massive
[3:11:40.660 --> 3:11:45.140]  election fraud right now i mean for the last year and a half at least no you're right we should
[3:11:45.140 --> 3:11:48.900]  declare that this election is already a fraud even though we think we're still going to win
[3:11:48.900 --> 3:11:53.780]  doesn't matter if it's a fraud we have a moral responsibility to say it is if if republicans
[3:11:53.780 --> 3:11:58.740]  hold the house it's only by overcoming massive fraud that's the only thing look we cannot have
[3:11:58.740 --> 3:12:04.820]  fair and free elections unless we have both sides of every issue able to speak online and since the
[3:12:04.820 --> 3:12:10.020]  tech giants have selectively censored conservative voices for about two years or all coming up on
[3:12:10.020 --> 3:12:17.540]  two years now this is not a functioning democratic election this is a stilted election that has been
[3:12:17.540 --> 3:12:23.860]  largely stolen by the political left running the tech giants and committing massive info fraud
[3:12:23.860 --> 3:12:28.500]  even you might call it journal terrorism on the part of the left wing media when you have cnn's
[3:12:28.500 --> 3:12:33.380]  don lemon up there saying that white people are bad or essentially that needs to be laws against
[3:12:33.380 --> 3:12:39.860]  being white uh this is true race baiting hit larry absolutely absolutely and and it shows they're
[3:12:39.860 --> 3:12:44.820]  going for broke so so i'm gonna let you take over which is why i wanted you here because i'm not
[3:12:44.820 --> 3:12:48.580]  saying i'm feeling your thunder it's the opposite you you bring the thunder i always forget to
[3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:54.500]  bring the thunder i was thinking about a stunt like i tend to do this weekend four days ago seems
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:12:58.580]  like a thousand years ago now because you can cut the anticipation with a knife and i was thinking
[3:12:58.580 --> 3:13:03.940]  i'll announce republicans win midterms and put an article out like i did a few days before the
[3:13:03.940 --> 3:13:13.460]  2016 then i realized now to get people thinking dims win midterms after big tech steals elections
[3:13:13.460 --> 3:13:17.540]  right that's and i meant to do that on monday and we haven't even talked since then i just said
[3:13:17.540 --> 3:13:22.180]  please come in and host and boom you're saying that because i think we should go with that
[3:13:22.180 --> 3:13:26.740]  because that gives people thinking and voting and then if they do steal it people understand
[3:13:26.740 --> 3:13:30.900]  what happened because they want to say the russians stole this last election no we want it
[3:13:30.900 --> 3:13:36.260]  right right right but but but now the the election meddling of the tech giants dwarfs anything the
[3:13:36.260 --> 3:13:42.020]  russians could have even hoped to achieve it's not even close and i am i'm very concerned alex and i
[3:13:42.020 --> 3:13:46.020]  know that this this opinion might differ from others who've been guests on your show we don't
[3:13:46.020 --> 3:13:50.660]  have a homogenized views right i mean we all have our own various views i think we're not
[3:13:50.660 --> 3:13:53.780]  democrats we go into a room we go this is what you're going to say or you're not on the air
[3:13:53.780 --> 3:13:57.780]  doesn't work that way not a call no not at all nobody told you what you're going to say not at
[3:13:57.780 --> 3:14:02.180]  all no i just said hey get mike adams on you couldn't go on then doug hagman had a family
[3:14:02.180 --> 3:14:05.140]  issue could come on we called you this morning that's right that's right there was no discussion
[3:14:05.140 --> 3:14:09.220]  about what you're gonna talk about no just you're a smart guy you're coming on the air i've got my
[3:14:09.220 --> 3:14:12.740]  own notes you know i always write my own notes i have my own and i know that people like okay we
[3:14:12.740 --> 3:14:17.220]  know that but that's nowhere else does that go on that's true go ahead and so i might say something
[3:14:17.220 --> 3:14:21.620]  that you disagree with and that's okay that's part of the of the debate the algorithm that we have
[3:14:21.620 --> 3:14:26.180]  here which is transparency and truth so i think that right now as of today this is subject to
[3:14:26.180 --> 3:14:32.500]  change but right now i think that democrats have a slight advantage to take the house but
[3:14:32.500 --> 3:14:37.940]  i also think there's a very high possibility that those who lose on the gop side may not
[3:14:37.940 --> 3:14:43.300]  concede this right away and that the election results may be challenged and that challenging
[3:14:43.300 --> 3:14:48.500]  those results at a state by state basis could throw this thing into turmoil that exactly out
[3:14:48.500 --> 3:14:53.700]  of that comes the national debate that ends the democrat election stealing could it could be yes
[3:14:53.700 --> 3:14:57.860]  because not only do we have the tech giants meddling and committing massive election fraud
[3:14:57.860 --> 3:15:03.780]  we've got the entire issue of illegals voting dead people voting and if if the illegal votes are
[3:15:03.780 --> 3:15:08.660]  enough to take it over the edge and give democrats the house then that will ignite a nationwide
[3:15:08.660 --> 3:15:12.580]  debate exactly eagles voting so instead of conservatives and libertarians and corporate
[3:15:12.580 --> 3:15:17.140]  and business guys always being nice and conceding no we're going to make a big deal out of this either
[3:15:17.140 --> 3:15:21.700]  way right because if you're not a citizen in this country you should not have the right to vote we
[3:15:21.700 --> 3:15:25.540]  need national voter id laws for this very reason they have them in almost every other country in
[3:15:25.540 --> 3:15:29.860]  the world when i lived in ecuador i was a resident they didn't allow me to vote in ecuador i didn't
[3:15:29.860 --> 3:15:35.300]  even attempt to you and i can't walk down to mexico and demand to vote in mexico doesn't work that
[3:15:35.300 --> 3:15:42.020]  way they would kill you that probably so yes so we must protect our democratic processes and our
[3:15:42.020 --> 3:15:47.220]  republic by demanding free and fair and honest elections and i don't think that's what we're
[3:15:47.220 --> 3:15:55.300]  going to have here it's been stolen all right mike adam's coming up hear that that's the sound
[3:15:55.300 --> 3:16:01.380]  of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place and what they don't steal

[3:20:03.700 --> 3:20:23.140]  we're continuing on the fourth hour here at the alex jones show mic adam's filling in thank you
[3:20:23.140 --> 3:20:29.060]  for continuing with me today as i expressed in the previous segment with alex i'm very concerned
[3:20:29.060 --> 3:20:34.660]  that we're losing the very fabric of our democracy well our constitutional republic is more accurate
[3:20:34.660 --> 3:20:40.500]  that there are so many things about this coming election that appear to have been fraudulently
[3:20:40.500 --> 3:20:44.180]  manipulated up front and we have to start questioning that regardless of the outcome
[3:20:44.740 --> 3:20:50.500]  you see we all support fair and free elections all of us we all support the idea of public
[3:20:50.500 --> 3:20:55.300]  debates and conversations that help people determine how they're going to vote in elections
[3:20:55.300 --> 3:21:02.020]  we all support freedom of information so that we can engage in those conversations and we also
[3:21:02.020 --> 3:21:08.180]  recognize that this is an essential part of our democracy if we didn't have access to information
[3:21:08.180 --> 3:21:14.180]  how could we vote in a fair and free way and yet that's exactly what has happened the tech giants
[3:21:14.180 --> 3:21:20.020]  through their concerted determined and targeted censorship of conservative voices over the last
[3:21:20.020 --> 3:21:25.940]  two years they have denied america the chance to engage in public conversations and debate that
[3:21:25.940 --> 3:21:32.980]  are inherent in fair fair and free elections and part of the fabric of democracy so they have
[3:21:32.980 --> 3:21:38.580]  stolen this election ahead of the election by silencing just conservative voices primarily
[3:21:38.580 --> 3:21:44.740]  with a few exceptions but it's it's probably 99 silencing of conservative voices and i've
[3:21:44.740 --> 3:21:50.180]  warned about this election fraud is happening right now i've even posted a video about this at
[3:21:50.180 --> 3:21:54.660]  brightion.com that's that's the new name for real.video by the way info wars has
[3:21:55.700 --> 3:21:59.140]  i don't know a couple thousand videos on there now by the way so brightion.com is where you can
[3:21:59.140 --> 3:22:06.020]  find those but this is a crisis of our democracy and what i've said recently in a counterthink
[3:22:06.020 --> 3:22:11.620]  broadcast here on info wars.com on last sunday is that i believe that right now because of this
[3:22:11.620 --> 3:22:18.180]  election meddling in this election fraud i believe that if the election is somewhat close maybe five
[3:22:18.180 --> 3:22:23.860]  or fewer seat advantage by the democrats in the house that there actually is justification for
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:28.260]  the president i believe to challenge the outcome of this election along the lines of what i've
[3:22:28.260 --> 3:22:33.700]  mentioned here really three things number one tech giants selective censoring which denies us
[3:22:33.700 --> 3:22:39.860]  the ability to engage in public conversation and debate number two the left-wing media no longer
[3:22:39.860 --> 3:22:47.220]  functioning as a media but functioning as a propaganda arm of the democrat party 92 negative
[3:22:47.220 --> 3:22:52.340]  news against president trump and conservatives well that's not a functioning media that's not
[3:22:52.340 --> 3:22:59.700]  what was enshrined in the first amendment that is an activist anti-america very irresponsible
[3:22:59.700 --> 3:23:06.180]  propaganda organization that's pretending to be the media and the third thing is election voting
[3:23:06.180 --> 3:23:13.940]  fraud voting by illegal aliens voting by dead people voting by people who who are voting more
[3:23:13.940 --> 3:23:19.060]  than once and these are the classic tactics of the democrats so you combine those three things
[3:23:19.060 --> 3:23:25.620]  and we are looking at a midterm election that is going to be influenced in a very strong way by a
[3:23:25.620 --> 3:23:32.180]  tremendous amount of of deceit by the left a dishonest democracy you might say or dishonest
[3:23:32.180 --> 3:23:39.140]  tactics that threaten democracy and i think we have to start questioning these outcomes in advance
[3:23:39.140 --> 3:23:46.420]  and if we overcome that it's going to be the biggest news story in the history of politics in
[3:23:46.420 --> 3:23:51.940]  america if the republicans managed to hold the house it will only be by overcoming massive fraud
[3:23:51.940 --> 3:23:59.460]  even going back to the 2016 election that trump won if you discount the illegal alien votes in
[3:23:59.460 --> 3:24:05.380]  that election it's very likely that hillary clinton herself did not even win the popular vote and if
[3:24:05.380 --> 3:24:12.020]  you discount the stolen votes by the tech giants with their undue and biased influence hillary
[3:24:12.020 --> 3:24:17.060]  clinton wouldn't have even won the popular vote much less the electoral college so there is our
[3:24:17.060 --> 3:24:22.500]  democracy is being stolen from us by dishonest bad actors that are the tech giants the left wing
[3:24:22.500 --> 3:24:29.140]  media and illegal aliens voting in this election plus on top of that of course we have the
[3:24:29.140 --> 3:24:36.340]  entire fake pipe bomb distraction which was timed in order to take people's focus off of the honduran
[3:24:36.340 --> 3:24:41.860]  caravan the caravan story was something that the left wing media quickly realized would not serve
[3:24:41.860 --> 3:24:46.580]  the interests of the democrats in the coming election and so they found ways to change their
[3:24:46.580 --> 3:24:54.740]  focus and change the mental focus of the nation to take away momentum from the gop and make believe
[3:24:54.740 --> 3:25:00.180]  now that this caravan sort of has gone away or isn't happening even though they are marching
[3:25:00.180 --> 3:25:05.300]  closer to our border every day and the size of the caravan continues to grow and the severity of
[3:25:05.300 --> 3:25:10.900]  the criminals inside the caravan continues to be discovered that they are carrying weapons and some
[3:25:10.900 --> 3:25:16.500]  are carrying or have been involved in bombings before some are felony criminals some are violent
[3:25:16.500 --> 3:25:21.700]  criminals and have been prosecuted in their home countries and now are trying to get into the united
[3:25:21.700 --> 3:25:28.100]  states by latching on to this caravan hoping they can be granted entrance and perhaps eventually
[3:25:28.100 --> 3:25:34.180]  residency or citizenship in the united states of america so that story has been pushed aside
[3:25:34.180 --> 3:25:39.860]  in order to focus on these false allegations leveled against president trump and against gab
[3:25:39.860 --> 3:25:46.580]  founder andrew torba alleging that these two people are somehow responsible for the insane deranged
[3:25:46.580 --> 3:25:54.580]  acts of a lunatic jewish synagogue shooter who hated trump by the way but yet the media tries
[3:25:54.580 --> 3:26:00.980]  to tie his actions to the president and to gab founder andrew torba now about gab by the way
[3:26:00.980 --> 3:26:06.820]  i want to be on the record saying that these attacks against torba and his family by the
[3:26:06.820 --> 3:26:13.700]  left wing media this dishonest coverage that blames him for these attacks it is so disgusting
[3:26:13.700 --> 3:26:21.460]  this shooter he had attack he had accounts excuse me on facebook he had accounts on other i think
[3:26:21.460 --> 3:26:26.340]  he had a twitter account as well and he posted on these other social media accounts and yet
[3:26:26.340 --> 3:26:31.140]  there's no one in the media that blames facebook for the actions of this shooter because that would
[3:26:31.140 --> 3:26:37.780]  be insane and yet they blame gab somehow it's gab's fault even though the the person tweeted
[3:26:37.780 --> 3:26:42.260]  or i'm sorry posted on gab only four minutes before he started to carry out that attack
[3:26:42.260 --> 3:26:47.700]  in fact that very close timeline tells me that this seems coordinated it seems like the way that
[3:26:47.700 --> 3:26:55.860]  they take down alternative social media websites or independent media is to deliberately post
[3:26:55.860 --> 3:27:00.660]  something to those sites before carrying out an attack precisely for the purpose of being able
[3:27:00.660 --> 3:27:06.100]  to blame those websites even though it's irrational and illogical to do so you know it makes no sense
[3:27:06.100 --> 3:27:11.140]  to blame gab uh what are you going to do uh check the guy's underwear was he wearing fruit of the
[3:27:11.140 --> 3:27:15.700]  loom underwear does that mean fruit of the loom is responsible for the shooting no that would be
[3:27:15.700 --> 3:27:21.140]  insane if he's wearing nike's is nike responsible for the shooting no that would be insane uh he
[3:27:21.140 --> 3:27:26.020]  posted on gab his gab responsible for the shooting of course not but the media tries to create that
[3:27:26.020 --> 3:27:32.420]  false link and in doing so the left wing media is actually harming this nation and carrying out a
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:39.700]  great disservice to this great country a a twisting of the truth that is intended to be a weaponized
[3:27:39.700 --> 3:27:45.060]  form of media disinformation to alter the outcome of this election and that's just one more way
[3:27:45.060 --> 3:27:52.180]  that this election is being stolen in advance now if you were to ask me today what my analysis
[3:27:52.180 --> 3:27:56.500]  is of the outcome of this election for next tuesday i had previously said that the chance of
[3:27:56.500 --> 3:28:04.340]  republicans holding the house was as high as 60 today i think that's more like 40 or perhaps
[3:28:04.340 --> 3:28:11.300]  35 percent it's an estimate this is a very wild election cycle no one can say for sure and there
[3:28:11.300 --> 3:28:14.820]  can still be events that can happen over the next five days that could dramatically alter the
[3:28:14.820 --> 3:28:19.860]  election of this outcome so my certainty of such a prediction is very low in this case
[3:28:19.860 --> 3:28:24.420]  unlike previous predictions where certainty was much higher anything can happen in the next few
[3:28:24.420 --> 3:28:29.620]  days but i want you to be ready for what's going to happen on the other side of this election
[3:28:29.620 --> 3:28:35.620]  no matter who wins so when we come back in fact i'm going to talk about the coming chaos scenarios
[3:28:35.620 --> 3:28:40.020]  that could unfold regardless of the outcome of this election because i want you to be prepared
[3:28:40.020 --> 3:28:45.860]  for what's coming i want you to be safe and i want america to survive this is mike adams here on

[3:30:54.900 --> 3:31:00.180]  of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to
[3:31:00.180 --> 3:31:04.740]  find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm
[3:31:04.740 --> 3:31:11.460]  introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled
[3:31:11.460 --> 3:31:16.420]  with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it
[3:31:16.420 --> 3:31:21.940]  supports the informal war it is a classical 360 win this is the formula that i personally have
[3:31:21.940 --> 3:31:27.140]  been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to
[3:31:27.140 --> 3:31:32.180]  a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to yourself you want to your family and you owe it to
[3:31:32.180 --> 3:31:37.300]  the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as

[3:31:51.780 --> 3:31:56.820]  and in foreshore life dot com the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and
[3:31:56.820 --> 3:32:02.340]  pump the environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers
[3:32:02.340 --> 3:32:08.180]  iq it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the
[3:32:08.180 --> 3:32:14.580]  best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[3:32:14.580 --> 3:32:18.980]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[3:32:18.980 --> 3:32:25.300]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now
[3:32:25.300 --> 3:32:30.340]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[3:32:30.340 --> 3:32:35.540]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[3:32:35.540 --> 3:32:42.340]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[3:32:42.340 --> 3:32:48.340]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see
[3:32:48.340 --> 3:32:53.060]  it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's life dot com
[3:32:53.060 --> 3:32:59.060]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:59.060 --> 3:33:09.060]  so
[3:33:15.060 --> 3:33:21.060]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[3:33:21.060 --> 3:33:30.580]  hope you're ready to ride the red tsunami that's a new hashtag being put out by info wars
[3:33:30.580 --> 3:33:37.140]  hashtag ride the red tsunami check it out info wars dot com will have coverage of course on
[3:33:37.140 --> 3:33:42.580]  november 6th and is talking about not just a red wave but perhaps a red tsunami of course the
[3:33:42.580 --> 3:33:48.500]  democrats are claiming that there's going to be a massive blue wave and i'm claiming that there's
[3:33:48.500 --> 3:33:54.580]  a massive fraudulent wave by the democrats that i talked about in the previous segment but
[3:33:54.580 --> 3:33:59.380]  regardless of what happens i want you to be ready for the a couple of scenarios that i'll cover here
[3:33:59.940 --> 3:34:04.020]  scenario number one that maybe a lot of people haven't talked about is what happens if this
[3:34:04.020 --> 3:34:11.220]  election is really not decided in the sense that on november 7th we wake up and there is
[3:34:11.220 --> 3:34:16.580]  contention and people have not conceded and that we don't know who controls the house of
[3:34:16.580 --> 3:34:24.180]  representatives and this situation could persist for weeks or even months because let's say the
[3:34:24.180 --> 3:34:31.700]  scenario is that there are some very close calls in in state elections involving house of representatives
[3:34:31.700 --> 3:34:37.540]  members and the those who lose refuse to concede this could be on the republican side or the democrat
[3:34:37.540 --> 3:34:42.820]  side either way and that the the control of the house of representatives comes down to a very small
[3:34:42.820 --> 3:34:49.460]  number of votes or seats such as let's say fewer than five you know two or three seats could easily
[3:34:49.460 --> 3:34:53.460]  decide this race in fact if the republicans managed to hold the house i predict they would
[3:34:53.460 --> 3:35:01.220]  do so only by a very slim margin uh perhaps only one seat now if that happens then what you have
[3:35:01.220 --> 3:35:08.820]  to do is look at the the chaos and stress that will persist for several months as this this
[3:35:08.820 --> 3:35:14.180]  all this pre-election stress continues with not knowing the outcome and you'll have then
[3:35:14.180 --> 3:35:19.860]  leftists riding in the streets probably really amping up and escalating their calls for democracy
[3:35:19.860 --> 3:35:25.220]  or whatever they want to say or they'll they'll accuse the GOP of refusing to consent to the
[3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:29.220]  outcome of the of the election and then you'll have trump and the GOP saying no the democrats
[3:35:29.220 --> 3:35:34.260]  stole this election in this scenario you would probably see an emergency appeal to the united
[3:35:34.260 --> 3:35:39.140]  state supreme court combined with left-wing media lying about the facts of what's actually
[3:35:39.140 --> 3:35:43.540]  happening because that's what they do they lie and they deceive but now you understand the importance
[3:35:43.540 --> 3:35:48.740]  of the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the court before the midterm elections and you understand
[3:35:48.740 --> 3:35:54.980]  the desperation of the democrats why they fought so hard to prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed
[3:35:54.980 --> 3:36:00.980]  because they knew that probably some serious challenges would come up very soon on several
[3:36:00.980 --> 3:36:05.300]  different topics possibly the election itself and that when these go to the united state supreme
[3:36:05.300 --> 3:36:12.660]  court Brett Kavanaugh is of course the final vote in the majority of so-called conservatives on the
[3:36:12.660 --> 3:36:18.340]  court right now and he is active on the court and he will be part of hearing any challenge that goes
[3:36:18.340 --> 3:36:24.580]  to the court so you've got not only Neil Gorsuch but also now Brett Kavanaugh who both have been of
[3:36:24.580 --> 3:36:31.060]  course put there by by trump and confirmed by the senate and they will have a major decision
[3:36:31.060 --> 3:36:35.620]  in any emergency appeal now here's here's the nightmare scenario that becomes a civil war
[3:36:36.740 --> 3:36:41.140]  if there is contention and we don't know who's controlling the house and there is an appeal
[3:36:41.140 --> 3:36:45.540]  that goes to the supreme court and if and by the way this has happened before remember the
[3:36:45.540 --> 3:36:51.140]  hanging chads in florida with al gore remember that and the supreme court made that decision and
[3:36:51.140 --> 3:36:56.420]  decided in favor of the republicans at that time and the democrats said that presidency was stolen
[3:36:56.420 --> 3:37:02.580]  from them so this has happened before if it happens again if a decision from the high court
[3:37:02.580 --> 3:37:08.980]  comes down and says that the GOP has won these elections and the GOP controls the house of
[3:37:08.980 --> 3:37:15.460]  representatives i predict that first of all maxine waters head will actually explode and secondly
[3:37:15.460 --> 3:37:21.060]  uh there will be massive violence by leftists all across america might take a couple of weeks
[3:37:21.060 --> 3:37:26.020]  for them to coordinate and organize all of their terrorism and arson and so on but before long
[3:37:26.020 --> 3:37:31.700]  you're going to have outbreaks of violence and civil unrest and and eventually escalating into
[3:37:31.700 --> 3:37:37.700]  civil war probably in at least 20 cities across america so that's i call that the nightmare scenario
[3:37:37.700 --> 3:37:42.820]  none of us want to see that scenario happen what all of us really want of course is to have fair
[3:37:42.820 --> 3:37:48.180]  and free elections which we're not having by the way but we want fair and free elections where we
[3:37:48.180 --> 3:37:53.700]  we wake up the next morning and it's all decided and we can all go back to our business and we
[3:37:53.700 --> 3:37:58.020]  can go back to being americans and we can focus on other things because nobody wants to talk about
[3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:04.900]  politics 24 seven well maybe some people do but it stresses us all out right so we want to know
[3:38:04.900 --> 3:38:10.820]  we want to have some certainty in the future it's the uncertainty and then the idea that leftists
[3:38:10.820 --> 3:38:16.180]  believe that democracy is being stolen from them even as they themselves are conspiring to steal
[3:38:16.180 --> 3:38:22.900]  democracy from the rest of america but that is the idea that will drive them to violence and
[3:38:22.900 --> 3:38:29.140]  escalations of civil war so those are my concerns i'm on the record now saying those publicly
[3:38:29.780 --> 3:38:34.180]  i'm i want to be on the record also saying that of course i absolutely would honor the
[3:38:34.180 --> 3:38:41.380]  outcome of any fair and free election even if my party didn't win and i'm not really a hardcore
[3:38:42.020 --> 3:38:46.740]  GOP party person anyway you know i'm not i'm not a tribalist political person
[3:38:47.460 --> 3:38:52.580]  but you know i don't believe in in the rhino republicans for example but i do believe in
[3:38:52.580 --> 3:38:56.580]  democracy and i do believe in honoring election outcomes even if you don't win them as long as
[3:38:56.580 --> 3:39:02.820]  the elections themselves were free and fair but that is not what we have in this case so now a
[3:39:02.820 --> 3:39:07.940]  couple of things coming up here in texas voting machines in texas are reportedly switching votes
[3:39:07.940 --> 3:39:14.020]  right now and according to an article by the verge this is happening not because of any
[3:39:14.020 --> 3:39:18.020]  hacking attempt they say i haven't looked into this so i don't know if they're telling the truth
[3:39:18.020 --> 3:39:23.140]  or not they say it's due to a bad user interface design of the machines they say that voters are
[3:39:23.140 --> 3:39:30.100]  using them incorrectly and thus it's causing votes to switch now i don't know how that could be the
[3:39:30.100 --> 3:39:36.740]  case i don't know how i mean voting is not that complicated you're clicking one box or another
[3:39:36.740 --> 3:39:42.980]  or filling in one oval or another you know most people can figure that out i guess not everybody
[3:39:42.980 --> 3:39:48.100]  but most people can figure that out i don't see how votes can change or people could even perceive
[3:39:48.100 --> 3:39:53.860]  votes changing unless something is deliberately wrong with the software or the processing of
[3:39:53.860 --> 3:39:59.940]  the voting machine and personally i don't trust electronic voting machines because we we know how
[3:39:59.940 --> 3:40:08.900]  much hacking or you could say bad act let's say sinister engineering goes into it where they design
[3:40:08.900 --> 3:40:13.060]  them to steal votes and they know they only have to steal let's say one percent of the votes
[3:40:13.620 --> 3:40:17.380]  to overturn the outcome of the election they don't have to steal every vote so it doesn't have to
[3:40:17.380 --> 3:40:22.420]  happen to everybody that's why even hearing of these machines switching votes for just
[3:40:22.420 --> 3:40:27.700]  a few people is quite alarming and we also have a world that day the article here fed
[3:40:27.700 --> 3:40:33.220]  suit over hillary clinton's security clearance that she was allowed to keep access despite
[3:40:33.220 --> 3:40:39.620]  mishandling classified information uh judicial watch of course a very important organization
[3:40:39.620 --> 3:40:43.700]  for the future of our country is suing the state department to find out why hillary clinton was
[3:40:43.700 --> 3:40:48.340]  allowed to keep her security clearance after the fb i determined that she had mishandled
[3:40:48.340 --> 3:40:53.380]  classified information of course she had her own private email server that violated the rules of
[3:40:53.380 --> 3:40:59.780]  the state department and when her emails were subpoenaed by congress she engaged in the criminal
[3:40:59.780 --> 3:41:06.260]  unlawful well that's redundant the criminal felony destruction of evidence to destroy those emails
[3:41:06.260 --> 3:41:12.500]  so that they would never be known hillary clinton remember the the election chant before the 2016
[3:41:12.500 --> 3:41:17.380]  elections lock her up and you hear that chant continuing in many trump rallies around the
[3:41:17.380 --> 3:41:23.540]  country i think it's time to actually lock her up and part of my hope is that if the republicans hold
[3:41:23.540 --> 3:41:30.020]  the house and the senate which seems very likely that trump would fire jeff sessions after this
[3:41:30.020 --> 3:41:36.020]  election replace sessions with someone who's actually willing to be the head of the doj instead of
[3:41:36.020 --> 3:41:43.940]  just uh an obstructionist which is what sessions is and then indict and prosecute the hundreds
[3:41:43.940 --> 3:41:50.580]  of deep state criminals like hillary clinton and like even eric holder for that matter and
[3:41:51.380 --> 3:41:56.100]  peter strock and james comey and many others inside the obama administration who clearly
[3:41:56.820 --> 3:42:03.140]  and and quite evidently it's obvious that they engaged in criminal felony obstruction felony
[3:42:03.140 --> 3:42:08.500]  destruction of evidence corruption multiple felony crimes at many different levels throughout
[3:42:08.500 --> 3:42:21.380]  the government obama himself has okay are we going all right wrapping up we'll be back all right

[3:47:33.860 --> 3:47:39.540]  being with us here i apologize for the little slip up in the last segment uh my fault uh
[3:47:39.540 --> 3:47:44.260]  not reading the clock correctly you know look the thing about this is that we don't have teleprompters
[3:47:44.260 --> 3:47:49.940]  and i'm i'm never told what to say no one writes a script for me of what to cover this is authentic
[3:47:49.940 --> 3:47:56.180]  this is genuine you know and sometimes it's not a hundred percent perfect in terms of of the the
[3:47:56.180 --> 3:48:02.420]  host performance but you know what we're passionate authentic americans we're here for all the right
[3:48:02.420 --> 3:48:07.860]  reasons and we're trying to save our country so along the way it's it there's going to be some
[3:48:07.860 --> 3:48:12.820]  interesting comedy from time to time but you know on on another topic that's very important for us
[3:48:12.820 --> 3:48:17.780]  to understand i posted a video it was actually late last night that talked about what i called the
[3:48:17.780 --> 3:48:23.780]  universal solution to tribalism and racism and censorship and so-called hate speech and all
[3:48:23.780 --> 3:48:28.900]  these other things and this is a very good video to watch if you if you want to understand
[3:48:28.900 --> 3:48:36.100]  and really what's going on in why why censorship is the wrong solution or the wrong response to
[3:48:36.100 --> 3:48:41.300]  all of this and i'll summarize it here for you in this segment because it's very powerful you know
[3:48:41.300 --> 3:48:46.660]  liberty we talk about liberty all the time but where does liberty come from and if you think
[3:48:46.660 --> 3:48:52.100]  about it really liberty comes from this idea that we have free will as individuals we have the
[3:48:52.100 --> 3:48:57.620]  ability to make individual decisions and it's because of that free will that we have a culture
[3:48:57.620 --> 3:49:02.020]  of liberty because we recognize that we are each individuals and we're capable of doing unique and
[3:49:02.020 --> 3:49:08.420]  different and innovative things as individuals but where does that freedom to think come from
[3:49:08.420 --> 3:49:15.220]  and that free will comes from the fact that you have a unique human spirit a soul or you could
[3:49:15.220 --> 3:49:20.580]  say a consciousness and that this this consciousness actually has a divine connection you know in
[3:49:20.580 --> 3:49:26.740]  religion it's called your your spirit you have the body the mind and the spirit and other people
[3:49:26.740 --> 3:49:34.260]  have this spirit too and so part of this this acceptance of universal liberty has to be paired
[3:49:34.260 --> 3:49:39.700]  with what i call universal dignity which is respecting the fact that other people also
[3:49:39.700 --> 3:49:45.460]  have consciousness they have souls as well and they have the right to exist and and they have
[3:49:45.460 --> 3:49:50.340]  the right to function as free will individuals and it all ties back to this fact that we have a
[3:49:50.340 --> 3:49:57.540]  non-physical spirit that's part of our human beingness if i can use that term it's part of the being
[3:49:57.540 --> 3:50:02.980]  the human being is more than just the human physical part it's not just the biology and the
[3:50:02.980 --> 3:50:08.340]  bones there's there's more to who you are than just the physical matter and that's the spirit and
[3:50:08.340 --> 3:50:17.060]  that's the soul now the key bigotry and racism that exists in our society is actually by leftists
[3:50:17.060 --> 3:50:23.620]  who they denounce the existence of the soul they say that there's no such thing as a soul or spirit
[3:50:23.620 --> 3:50:29.780]  and thus they dehumanize everybody in the deepest way the most sinister way imaginable saying that
[3:50:29.780 --> 3:50:34.340]  you're not even a human being because you don't have a soul that there's nothing divine about you
[3:50:34.340 --> 3:50:39.700]  you don't have a connection to god because in their view they think there is no god and thus that
[3:50:39.700 --> 3:50:44.580]  it's the ultimate bigotry it's the ultimate discrimination and racism because they're
[3:50:44.580 --> 3:50:49.860]  saying that you you're not even really a fully qualified human being at all when the truth is
[3:50:49.860 --> 3:50:55.780]  there are some individuals on our planet who i would say are not fully qualified human beings
[3:50:55.780 --> 3:51:02.980]  and those would be the relatively small number of individuals who are demon possessed let's say or
[3:51:02.980 --> 3:51:09.460]  who are you know their bodies are occupied by non-human entities and i know it sounds a little
[3:51:09.460 --> 3:51:15.780]  farfetched but even the catholic church routinely carries out you know exorcisms they have priests
[3:51:15.780 --> 3:51:20.020]  that that run around and find people that they say are possessed by demons and then they exercise
[3:51:20.020 --> 3:51:25.460]  those demons there's one catholic priest i read recently that says that he alone has sent i think
[3:51:25.460 --> 3:51:33.060]  165 000 if the number is correct demons back to hell as he says and that's this is an accepted
[3:51:33.060 --> 3:51:38.420]  practice turns out in almost every major world religion you can go to indigenous religions in
[3:51:38.420 --> 3:51:43.300]  aborigine australia or the the south american rainforest you can go to different religions
[3:51:43.300 --> 3:51:47.700]  all around the world and one of the concepts they all have in common that they all share
[3:51:47.700 --> 3:51:54.180]  is this idea that there's such a thing as a possession a demonic or satanic possession of
[3:51:54.180 --> 3:52:00.260]  of a human body so that that person is no longer fully qualified human so it's up to you to decide
[3:52:00.260 --> 3:52:05.620]  whether you think that exists or not but for everybody else who's not an actual demon possessed
[3:52:05.620 --> 3:52:12.020]  entity everybody else is a human being and thus when we talk about liberty and we talk about
[3:52:12.020 --> 3:52:19.220]  dignity and we talk about the freedom to speak it has an underlying cause an underlying principle
[3:52:19.220 --> 3:52:25.220]  which is that we have human souls and that souls are divine souls have a connection to god and it
[3:52:25.220 --> 3:52:30.660]  is from this that all liberty springs and this is what our founding fathers really meant when they
[3:52:30.660 --> 3:52:36.100]  said that power of government comes from the people because it's the people that come from god
[3:52:36.660 --> 3:52:42.340]  and people grant limited power to the government to carry out certain things not to rule over us
[3:52:42.340 --> 3:52:46.980]  and not to give us rights but rather we give the government limited powers and we retain all of our
[3:52:46.980 --> 3:52:52.660]  rights as individuals as free people because we are divine and america was founded under
[3:52:53.300 --> 3:52:58.340]  christian principles america is a christian nation so it's founded under this principle of
[3:52:58.340 --> 3:53:03.060]  recognizing the importance of god in our lives and the importance importance of divine existence
[3:53:03.700 --> 3:53:10.580]  and so from that the contrast on the left is that you don't have a right to be an individual
[3:53:10.580 --> 3:53:16.660]  that we must all live under a totalitarian regime that tells you what you can think what you can
[3:53:16.660 --> 3:53:23.220]  speak what you're allowed to say or do in society because the left does not believe that you exist
[3:53:23.220 --> 3:53:28.900]  as a human conscious entity they believe that you must be told what to do that you are just a
[3:53:28.900 --> 3:53:34.580]  biological automaton that has no inherent freedom because you have no free will from their point
[3:53:34.580 --> 3:53:42.180]  of view and that's why leftism leads to atheism and also authoritarianism and if you look at left-wing
[3:53:42.180 --> 3:53:47.460]  countries and cultures such as communist china and communism in general north korea and others
[3:53:47.460 --> 3:53:53.860]  they always denounce god and they denounce religion they denounce even buddhism why is that because
[3:53:53.860 --> 3:54:01.220]  their authoritarianism and their philosophy of controlling people is incompatible with the
[3:54:01.220 --> 3:54:06.260]  embracing of the idea of consciousness and having a divine soul does that make sense
[3:54:07.140 --> 3:54:14.900]  let me just repeat that communism and left-wing countries and left-wing philosophies they realize
[3:54:14.900 --> 3:54:20.660]  that their authoritarian control is incompatible with the realization that we are divine beings
[3:54:20.660 --> 3:54:27.140]  with divine consciousness that have some connection to a divine entity god you see so they must denounce
[3:54:27.140 --> 3:54:32.020]  god they must denounce christians they must denounce jews they must denounce really all
[3:54:32.020 --> 3:54:37.060]  organized religion and they must denounce the very existence of the human spirit in order to convince
[3:54:37.060 --> 3:54:42.980]  people that they don't have a right to be free and thus when we talk about liberty when we talk
[3:54:42.980 --> 3:54:47.620]  about human dignity and when we talk about free speech and tolerance of of different ideas and
[3:54:47.620 --> 3:54:54.020]  all the things that we believe in as core principles of you know pro-liberty pro-america
[3:54:54.020 --> 3:54:59.540]  individuals i want you to understand that it's not just a flippant kind of comment it's not just
[3:54:59.540 --> 3:55:07.860]  a liberty bumper sticker it is an entire multi-layered fabric of understanding what it means to be
[3:55:07.860 --> 3:55:13.780]  human and that is why i have said and i've been criticized for this i have said that every every
[3:55:13.780 --> 3:55:18.980]  human being has a right to exist and some people some people were commenting on my on my podcast
[3:55:18.980 --> 3:55:24.180]  on this and they said well well why are you against the Honduran caravan then no i'm not against the
[3:55:24.180 --> 3:55:29.700]  caravan those people have a right to exist i i have compassion for those people they have every
[3:55:29.700 --> 3:55:34.900]  right to exist they do not have the right to invade america and steal your pocketbook and
[3:55:34.900 --> 3:55:39.060]  demand voting rights they do not have the right to cut in line in front of the other immigrants
[3:55:39.700 --> 3:55:44.420]  so i love the people of Honduras as i love any fellow brothers and sisters who are human beings
[3:55:44.420 --> 3:55:49.380]  around the world and the best way we can help those people is to spread liberty and dignity
[3:55:49.380 --> 3:55:54.500]  to their home countries so that they don't have to flee Honduras and these other people don't have
[3:55:54.500 --> 3:55:59.860]  to flee other central and south american nations if they have more economic freedom and they have
[3:55:59.860 --> 3:56:04.900]  more personal liberty in their home countries then their home countries will be more successful
[3:56:04.900 --> 3:56:09.300]  they will have less suffering less strife they will have economic liberty as well as political
[3:56:09.300 --> 3:56:14.420]  liberty and they will have no reason to flee like the people of venezuela the way to help the people
[3:56:14.420 --> 3:56:20.180]  of venezuela is to fix venezuela the way to help the people of Honduras is to fix their country
[3:56:20.180 --> 3:56:25.860]  it's not to just bring everybody into the united states and then ignore the source of the problems
[3:56:25.860 --> 3:56:30.500]  in their home countries because those problems are problems that frankly stem from radical
[3:56:30.500 --> 3:56:36.100]  left-wing ideology that denies the existence of the human soul denies the existence of god
[3:56:36.900 --> 3:56:40.740]  denies the existence of human consciousness from which free will and liberty spring
[3:56:40.740 --> 3:56:47.300]  so i i i've i've kind of covered this in in three different ways here but i want you to think about
