[08:46.120 --> 08:53.480]  coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas Austin we have unprecedented news
[08:53.480 --> 08:58.920]  unprecedented breaking information that affects basically everything on our globe
[08:58.920 --> 09:04.520]  that connects in to the TPP and other globalist treaties that circumvent
[09:04.520 --> 09:10.360]  sovereignty that are dictatorial the Bilderberg group founded in the early
[09:10.360 --> 09:16.720]  1950s in Oosterbeck Holland has been made up of British Dutch royalty European
[09:16.720 --> 09:23.200]  and US robber barons crony capitalist their own annals have been released to
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.200]  the BBC about eight years ago admitting that they founded the European Union by
[09:28.200 --> 09:35.240]  stealth just as the TPP ties a specific region into the American Union through
[09:35.240 --> 09:41.520]  NAFTA and GATT and ties into the EU this system was set up in secret and
[09:41.520 --> 09:46.680]  Bilderberg brags members of Bilderberg have bragged since they've been exposed
[09:46.680 --> 09:56.920]  that they created the European Union the G7 is meeting as we speak in Europe then
[09:56.920 --> 10:05.680]  they will segue into the Bilderberg group meeting in Austria in the mountains
[10:05.680 --> 10:13.280]  now in past Bilderberg group events they closed the hotel the day before this
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.360]  time they closed it over a week before and my reporters Rob do and Josh Owen
[10:20.360 --> 10:27.000]  who are about to talk to right now encountered roadblocks driving in from
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.920]  the airport 40 miles away in telfs at the base of the mountain range six miles
[10:33.920 --> 10:39.320]  from the hotel they searched their vehicles they pulled things out of the
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.960]  car they searched other people's vehicles they had the highway shut down two
[10:43.960 --> 10:50.000]  miles outside more checkpoints they had police at their little lodge hotel two
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.760]  miles away searching people as well so joining us from two miles from the
[10:56.760 --> 11:04.600]  Bilderberg group meeting is our reporters Josh Owens and of course Rob do
[11:04.600 --> 11:14.040]  in fours nightly news director this is this is unprecedented because ten years
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.320]  ago mainstream media would say this didn't exist but thanks to drugs report
[11:17.320 --> 11:22.160]  calm the London Guardian gets credit as well they began to link to our stories
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.600]  about a decade ago forcing national debate I've had the New York Times come
[11:26.600 --> 11:32.440]  out and say this doesn't exist well no the TPP does exist Obama ruling by
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.800]  executive action does exist and now that we're forcing an international
[11:38.800 --> 11:42.520]  national debate about this this whole agenda is in trouble
[11:42.520 --> 11:48.760]  Senator Paul is demanding Obama release the TPP right now a lot of exciting
[11:48.760 --> 11:53.240]  things are going on we're exposing the globalist shadow government that I
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.120]  like it to something like Specter from James Bond movies or or Hydra from
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.120]  Captain America I mean that's really pull it up in mainstream Austrian news
[12:04.120 --> 12:12.960]  guess who the security is this year for Bilderberg Cobra security and guess what
[12:12.960 --> 12:18.800]  they're based out of a castle nearby so the security whereas black uniforms
[12:18.800 --> 12:27.160]  calls themselves Cobra and comes out of a Germanic castle this is where reality
[12:27.160 --> 12:30.560]  is stranger than fiction we'll put up that article on screen later of your
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.960]  review or listener I know it sounds crazy but it's true joining us now from
[12:35.960 --> 12:43.840]  the tiny Hamlet up the mountain from Telf to give us the details is Rob do
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.640]  and to talk about what he's gone through Rob do of infowars.com thank you
[12:49.640 --> 12:53.400]  Alex Rob do reporting live from Telf Austria we actually to come back down
[12:53.400 --> 12:56.200]  into tells to get a better signal our cell phone signal was not too good up
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.920]  there on the mountain but let me tell you what I've seen today is so far blown
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.440]  out of proportion the security on here you just go right up right up the road
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.360]  here around the curve right outside of tells and you hit a giant roadblock
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.600]  they're diverting cars off to the side they stopped us they didn't like Josh's
[13:12.600 --> 13:16.360]  Texas driver's license so they said pull over so we pulled over then they
[13:16.360 --> 13:19.240]  wanted to see the papers of the car then they want to know what we were doing
[13:19.240 --> 13:22.800]  we showed them the booking check-in that wasn't good enough they wanted to see
[13:22.800 --> 13:26.080]  our passports and they said open up the trunk they wanted to see what was in our
[13:26.080 --> 13:30.840]  bags this is blows my mind Rob you're having a little bit of audio problem
[13:30.840 --> 13:34.480]  you're over driven if you can turn down your audio at source or back that
[13:34.480 --> 13:40.520]  microwave about a foot that'd be good Rob do Rob do of infowars.com joining us
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.400]  from the foot of the mountain with the Bilderberg group meeting is set to be
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.280]  about six miles out where they set up check checkpoints six miles out truly
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.000]  unprecedented Rob do that's right and right up that hill behind me is where
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.960]  the Bilderberg are meeting up that mountain
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.840]  you can't really stop and let me tell you it gets really weird when you get up
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.560]  there there's police bands everywhere and these aren't like the local police the
[14:05.560 --> 14:08.600]  local police here wear khakis and they kind of look like Boy Scouts that's a
[14:08.600 --> 14:11.720]  bell going off of a church right next to me you want to pan up there and see
[14:11.720 --> 14:14.520]  that we're right next to this giant church we decided to come down here and
[14:14.520 --> 14:19.120]  shoot but let me tell you Alex the amount of police presence here is
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.720]  ridiculous they were at our hotel when we arrived we were the only two people at
[14:23.720 --> 14:26.680]  this hotel the owners weren't even there they left the key under the doormat
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.160]  for us okay and so we see a police van they come out they start questioning us
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.040]  we're trying to call the owners to check in we couldn't even check into the hotel
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.840]  we had cops surrounding us we put a video up on info wars on the YouTube
[14:39.840 --> 14:42.240]  channel the Alex Jones channel you should be able to see it now it should be
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.800]  uploaded we're dealing with low bandwidth out here we're in the middle of nowhere
[14:46.800 --> 14:49.880]  this is the middle of the Austrian Alps which is I think why the Bilderberg
[14:49.880 --> 14:54.520]  show that chose this place because it's secret it's very secluded there's
[14:54.520 --> 14:57.960]  nothing surrounding that hotel but forest and a golf course and there's
[14:57.960 --> 15:03.440]  nothing else around it even the pass the hiking pass we saw police walking the
[15:03.440 --> 15:08.600]  hiking pass they're going on foot patrols they are serious about this and let me
[15:08.600 --> 15:11.080]  tell you after I talked to you Alex you said they're gonna come back and talk to
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.360]  you guess what they showed up at our door about eight of them show up and then
[15:16.360 --> 15:18.600]  more show up they just come marching down the hill they want to see our
[15:18.600 --> 15:24.200]  passports they want to start checking us over to info wars.com nightly news
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.000]  director I want you to start over from the beginning flying into Austria driving
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.360]  in A to Z tell us about what's happened in your last eight hours there on the
[15:32.360 --> 15:37.600]  ground where it's about to be evening okay yeah it's about six o'clock six
[15:37.600 --> 15:41.680]  thirty right now we flew in we first made a stop in O'Hare and I decided to
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.280]  shoot a report asked some people about Bilderberg nobody really knew about it
[15:45.280 --> 15:47.680]  nobody knew anything about it they thought it was a group and that's what I
[15:47.680 --> 15:52.840]  find most people just don't know what it is I was at a party with some buddies of
[15:52.840 --> 15:56.280]  mine told them I'm going to the Bilderberg conference in Austria and they
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.080]  go Bilderberg Bilderberg no it's not Bilderberg people it's the Bilderberg
[16:00.080 --> 16:06.200]  group it's some of the most influential people in Western culture Europe Canada
[16:06.200 --> 16:09.960]  United States they all get together and they all conspire in secret and they
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.880]  say it's a private meeting so they don't want you there but they make you pay for
[16:13.880 --> 16:17.160]  all the police presence there's two thousand cops crawling over this mountain
[16:17.160 --> 16:20.240]  right now that the people of Switzerland or in Austria I'm sorry the people of
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.680]  Austria are going to be paying for out of their tax dollars when they don't have
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.680]  taxes for roads that's right Rob do and so describe once you got to Austria
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.240]  right now what happened to you today all right so we pull it we pull into
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.480]  Telps we finally got here it took a long time long long flight across the
[16:36.480 --> 16:41.200]  Atlantic Ocean we pull into Telps everything looks fine we round the
[16:41.200 --> 16:47.440]  corner outside of Telps and boom giant security checkpoint they're diverting the
[16:47.440 --> 16:51.240]  traffic off to the right they're stopping people they have a canopy built over
[16:51.240 --> 16:54.200]  over this area I mean it wasn't something that they just built this wasn't
[16:54.200 --> 16:58.640]  just a couple of cones no it is a giant roadblock and this is the future this is
[16:58.640 --> 17:01.800]  the future people don't wake up and start demanding answers and demanding
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.160]  accountability from people who are part of the Bilderberg operation so we put we
[17:06.160 --> 17:10.160]  got pulled over and they asked to see Josh's license he shows him his Texas
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.520]  driver's license he goes Texas and then he wants to see our passports and then we
[17:14.520 --> 17:17.440]  show them the they don't like that we're going up that area so we show them the
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.800]  booking papers and say hey we're staying at a hotel right up the hill and they
[17:21.800 --> 17:24.440]  didn't like that they wanted to see my passport because my name is attached to
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.200]  the booking and then they go well get out let's see let's see the car so then at
[17:28.200 --> 17:31.920]  that point I pulled the camera out and start filming and then I guess he was a
[17:31.920 --> 17:35.680]  higher-ranking official there he had a different colored shirt on different
[17:35.680 --> 17:39.680]  hat he says no no no don't do that so he tapped me on the shoulder so I put the
[17:39.680 --> 17:43.440]  camera down because I don't know how these guys act here especially the police
[17:43.440 --> 17:46.920]  that are patrolling right now are a lot different than like the local police here
[17:46.920 --> 17:50.360]  the local police here kind of look like Boy Scouts they have tackies with green
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.720]  these guys are wearing blue yeah they're federal they're federal police and we're
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.360]  showing amazing footage of when they came to your hotel after so so go through
[17:58.360 --> 18:01.840]  all this first thing you go through a checkpoint they pull you over the
[18:01.840 --> 18:07.160]  they're searching continue right so we got through that we go up the hill we
[18:07.160 --> 18:10.760]  pass two or three other cars we see more of them on the trails just standing
[18:10.760 --> 18:15.120]  around just setting up perimeters then we get to where our hotel is as we pull
[18:15.120 --> 18:19.320]  in nobody's there except another police van there's another police van and we see
[18:19.320 --> 18:24.000]  guys walking down the trail they've been on a foot patrol so we're trying to
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.840]  unload our stuff figure out where we're going to put our stuff find our room we
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.600]  finally get into our room we start unloading stuff and during this time
[18:31.600 --> 18:34.600]  Josh had talked to a couple guys we were trying to call the owners to get the key
[18:34.600 --> 18:38.560]  and I you can see that footage it's there in the in the video they're
[18:38.560 --> 18:42.680]  surrounding in questioning what are you doing here who are you da da da da da so
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.080]  let's remember you're about two miles then from even the property line of the
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.640]  big resort where the Bilderberg group is going to be meeting in five days or four
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.680]  days now I mean they're not going to be there till Thursday Alex today is
[18:57.680 --> 19:01.800]  Monday it's Monday morning but they had the trails closed off last week they've
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.960]  had they've had these federal police out here for almost almost a week now and
[19:06.960 --> 19:11.040]  it's ridiculous this is taxpayer money well remember this supposedly this group
[19:11.040 --> 19:14.640]  didn't exist then when it did exist there's no governmental decisions being
[19:14.640 --> 19:17.800]  made but their own animals have been leaked they are making decisions this is
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.560]  just a continuation of the G7 we've got Jeb Bush in Europe right now reportedly
[19:22.560 --> 19:25.800]  deciding whether he's going to run or not this is where Bill Clinton went in
[19:25.800 --> 19:31.640]  1991 and came from nowhere it's where Tony Blair went in 1994 before becoming
[19:31.640 --> 19:36.680]  prime minister these are the major king makers when we come back Rob do is
[19:36.680 --> 19:42.920]  reporting from Austria six miles from Bilderberg with checkpoints all the way

[19:46.760 --> 19:50.960]  meeting and for a week Austrian papers have reported the federal presence there
[19:50.960 --> 19:55.720]  crawling all over the hills looking to stop any reporters that dare try to go

[22:21.640 --> 22:25.960]  transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad

[24:24.040 --> 24:29.800]  Rob Dew Info Wars nightly news chief of staff is up there with Josh Owen of
[24:29.800 --> 24:37.160]  Info Wars they're in Telves six miles away to get internet there is a another
[24:37.160 --> 24:40.800]  little town that they're staying in that's up on the top and you go over the
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.800]  mountain and Bilderberg's two miles away the hotel there tell us again the name of
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.520]  the little town up on the top of the hill where you're staying and then
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.160]  describe the hotel where Bilderberg huge luxury complex golf course you name it
[24:55.160 --> 25:01.880]  out in the middle of the Austrian Alps and this is truly unprecedented not even
[25:01.880 --> 25:08.080]  G20 sets up checkpoints six miles away not even G7 and of course we see G7
[25:08.080 --> 25:13.000]  meeting right before Bilderberg you'll have the very people that are at the G7
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.520]  at this event when I was in England two years ago of course the Prime Minister
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.520]  was there and they said oh he won't be there and then of course he did show up
[25:20.520 --> 25:25.320]  and became a national news story they do not want to be revealed because then
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.560]  their agenda of TPP and the rest of it starts getting exposed just like the
[25:30.560 --> 25:36.600]  exposure of Bilderberg is now forcing the UK to go for a vote and a referendum
[25:36.600 --> 25:42.240]  which they never had on being under the EU imagine being absorbed by another
[25:42.240 --> 25:49.200]  grouping of countries and you never had a vote so Rob do joining us again from
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.640]  Telfz Austria describe the topography describe the local geography and give
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.200]  us a 360 pan sure I'll do that the place where we're staying is called Buchan
[26:00.200 --> 26:04.840]  and it's a little hamlet probably where we're at is actually two lodges and a
[26:04.840 --> 26:07.360]  little small apartment and then across the street there's a couple other
[26:07.360 --> 26:11.280]  buildings but that's about it it also has a bus station there and then you go a
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.480]  little bit further down the road and you hit the hotel interalpin and that looks
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.800]  like a giant pyramid go figure that's where the elites would want to meet and
[26:19.800 --> 26:23.480]  something looks like a giant three-sided pyramid and there's a golf course up
[26:23.480 --> 26:25.880]  there and then there's nothing much else up there but let me give you a quick
[26:25.880 --> 26:30.600]  pan we're staying up the hill up the hill it's up the mountain but let me let
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.280]  me show you over here Alex look at this I mean nothing but beautiful tranquility
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.080]  mountains you hear birds chirping there's a car going by every once in a
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.400]  while but really peaceful and that piece is being totally decimated now by these
[26:44.400 --> 26:50.000]  federal cops you know why because small smog moved into the mountain that's
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.640]  right he liked the gold that was contained within the mountain and he
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.920]  doesn't like you being there so his his orcs are running around looking for any
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.840]  press that is a perfect metaphor for what is going on because they are orcs
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.800]  they gave they gave Josh the stink eye really bad at the end they go look we
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.080]  will tell you where you can go you can go here you can't go there you go down
[27:14.080 --> 27:19.640]  there you can't go over there it was really it was very orcish it was very
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.800]  orcish finish up with the federal police that are there that's that's
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.840]  Susan of itself that Austrian that's what they are looked them up federal
[27:27.840 --> 27:33.080]  police are there in their tactical outfits running around harassing reporters
[27:33.080 --> 27:36.320]  describe the whole catalog of what happened to you then we're gonna go to
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.000]  right come back with Josh Schoen get his take well so we were putting together
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.320]  footage of the interaction at the checkpoint and then the first interaction
[27:44.320 --> 27:48.200]  at the hotel and then all of a sudden Josh goes they're coming down and Josh
[27:48.200 --> 27:51.360]  how many were coming down at that point I was editing so I wasn't looking about
[27:51.360 --> 27:55.640]  eight coming down this beautiful prairie like something like a bizarro little
[27:55.640 --> 27:59.600]  house on the prairie these these giant federal troops coming down just looking
[27:59.600 --> 28:03.600]  like that and then they go we want to see your passport passport passport so
[28:03.600 --> 28:06.000]  they're getting in our face one of our passports we give them our passports they
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.560]  go who else is staying with you this place can house four people we go we have
[28:09.560 --> 28:13.320]  one other person on the reservation the the owner told us to put everybody on
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.520]  that we thought would come up so we had also a PJW Paul Joseph Watson on the
[28:17.520 --> 28:20.520]  reservation as well so he could get up the hill because let me tell you if
[28:20.520 --> 28:24.160]  you're not on that booking they're not letting you pass the checkpoint so then
[28:24.160 --> 28:27.760]  they took that I showed him my press pass I said here here I'm press you know
[28:27.760 --> 28:40.200]  we're here a couple we're having a sky break up let's let's fade him down for a
[28:40.200 --> 28:47.000]  moment tell him to start back over he started cutting out dude you're at the
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.640]  part about surrounded by cops and you were telling them that you were press
[28:52.640 --> 28:57.320]  and go ahead right I pulled out my press pass I said I'm with free speech
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.400]  systems info wars.com they're starting to write all this down they're really
[29:01.400 --> 29:05.040]  looking intent they're like you said you were on a trip I said well we had a
[29:05.040 --> 29:10.280]  couple days to kill and the real event isn't certain till Thursday so yeah we
[29:10.280 --> 29:13.360]  are on a trip right now we're we're shooting beautiful video of this
[29:13.360 --> 29:16.920]  beautiful countryside a very beautiful country the flying the flight in was
[29:16.920 --> 29:20.360]  amazing we were flying next to Mount we have footage of that we'll put up later
[29:20.360 --> 29:24.000]  tonight just getting here we're gonna have a whole montage but we and we
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.200]  thought we'd have time to finish up with the cops when we come back and then
[29:27.200 --> 29:31.240]  I'll give you a moment to switch Josh in front of the camera but juxtapose this to
[29:31.240 --> 29:34.960]  England certainly not free compared to the way it used to be where we had like
[29:34.960 --> 29:39.960]  3,000 demonstrators outside not one arrest not one problem with the cops the
[29:39.960 --> 29:44.440]  cops coming to our hotel having dinner with us 3,000 people showing up no
[29:44.440 --> 29:48.960]  problems you go to Austria and you know the stereotype rains true on the March
[29:48.960 --> 30:00.360]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network maybe I'm old
[30:00.360 --> 30:04.840]  fashioned but back in my day a school field trip consisted of a sack lunch
[30:04.840 --> 30:08.400]  and a trip to the zoo but now they've upped the ante in places like
[30:08.400 --> 30:12.960]  Minneapolis where a private school is taking their kids to a sex shop that's
[30:12.960 --> 30:17.040]  right multiple news outlets reporting that parents are demanding school
[30:17.040 --> 30:21.520]  cheats removal after she took a group to the smitten kitten for sex education
[30:21.520 --> 30:25.520]  class and as you might imagine a place like the smitten kitten has several
[30:25.520 --> 30:29.880]  objects that you won't find in gym class and while the school has not been
[30:29.880 --> 30:34.240]  available for direct comment they did issue a statement guy a democratic
[30:34.240 --> 30:38.160]  schools board of directors stands behind the premise of the field trip the
[30:38.160 --> 30:42.000]  statement said we view it as a legitimate learning experience that relates
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.560]  directly to the topics covered during our year-long sexual health class some
[30:46.560 --> 30:50.800]  parents like Steven straw Matt are mad as hell and have already removed their
[30:50.800 --> 30:55.280]  children from the school you can find more reports on the Alex Jones channel
[30:55.280 --> 31:01.400]  on YouTube ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms
[31:01.400 --> 31:04.800]  manufacturers and sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly
[31:04.800 --> 31:08.880]  news or the news website info wars.com because the companies I've been
[31:08.880 --> 31:13.360]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as
[31:13.360 --> 31:18.160]  they should be so I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the
[31:18.160 --> 31:23.080]  years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms

[34:49.760 --> 34:55.960]  fighting weight and I've lost 60 plus pounds since then I mean when I got my
[34:55.960 --> 34:58.760]  shirt off and stuff I've taken the photos and shown people it's at info

[35:08.600 --> 35:12.080]  have a six pack I've got a long torso so bending over there's still a small
[35:12.080 --> 35:19.720]  belly there but I've gone from being obese I've gone from being in perfect
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.640]  shape to being obese to now getting back towards it doing less exercise than I
[35:24.640 --> 35:28.600]  was three years ago I was swimming a mile almost every day trying to jog
[35:28.600 --> 35:32.840]  lifting weights and it just wasn't doing it because I didn't have the iodine in
[35:32.840 --> 35:39.520]  my body I needed and the photos we have on screen right there was just what I
[35:39.520 --> 35:45.320]  lost in 45 days taking supermal vitality and x2 religiously and not
[35:45.320 --> 35:52.920]  forgetting to do it and look I don't claim I'm some beach boy model the point
[35:52.920 --> 35:58.960]  is it's a dramatic effect info wars life calm info wars store calm I wasn't
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.080]  intending to plug survival shield nason iodine x2 and supermal vitality the two
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.840]  key products oxy powder helped as well it helped me do it but then we were
[36:07.840 --> 36:13.520]  looking at photos to illustrate that Bilderberg a couple years ago you know
[36:13.520 --> 36:18.120]  3,000 plus people show up everything's peaceful we exposed it newspapers all
[36:18.120 --> 36:21.800]  over the world report on it people say why are the elite meeting in secret it
[36:21.800 --> 36:27.440]  does violate British laws it violates US laws and so now they just meet in
[36:27.440 --> 36:34.400]  Austria famous for being a police state just like Germany is where they ban you
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.920]  know demonstrations against radical Islam well they can ban anything if you
[36:38.920 --> 36:45.800]  do that and then now I've got my friendly mild-mannered reporters that are
[36:45.800 --> 36:56.280]  simply there at Bilderberg 2015 and all they're trying to do is report on what's
[36:56.280 --> 37:02.720]  happening and the way the cops are acting unless they get word and in
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.920]  pressure to stop they're gonna probably end up setting the guys up giving them
[37:06.920 --> 37:10.840]  tickets arresting them throwing them out of the area something which will cause
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.920]  an even bigger incident for Bilderberg I mean if Bilderberg is smart because my
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.920]  guys are well-behaved so was I no problem in England told the cops I was
[37:19.920 --> 37:22.920]  coming there told them I wasn't gonna stir up any trouble I was gonna try to
[37:22.920 --> 37:27.720]  cover a legitimate event it's legitimate to want to cover 150 world leaders
[37:27.720 --> 37:31.520]  meeting in secret and I said if you want to be stupid and arrest me or set me up
[37:31.520 --> 37:36.200]  as Canada did and make it a big story you go ahead and do it I said if you want
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.480]  to be legitimate and act like a free country I'll buy you dinner the cops
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.360]  wouldn't let me buy them dinner but they did you know have a Coca-Cola with us but
[37:45.360 --> 37:48.000]  a lot of cops told us off record no we totally agree with you know this is
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.080]  criminal they're here to loot our country same thing happened in Switzerland
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.840]  same thing happened in the US the cops were on our side most of them because
[37:56.840 --> 38:01.200]  why wouldn't you be on free speech aside reporters aren't illegal cameras aren't
[38:01.200 --> 38:07.240]  illegal but no in Austria they are acting like famous thugs and this is
[38:07.240 --> 38:10.800]  what Estaline predicted when he was on a few weeks ago I guess a month ago
[38:10.800 --> 38:16.040]  with us he said Austria is a serious police state they like to cover it up
[38:16.040 --> 38:22.280]  but look out when your people are there I want to show some of the Watford
[38:22.280 --> 38:25.680]  newspapers it was all over British newspapers but I think we type in
[38:25.680 --> 38:32.120]  Bilderberg 2013 Watford or Alex Jones talks to press Bilderberg 2013 you'll
[38:32.120 --> 38:37.400]  get amazing press photos off the cover of newspapers the shots we're looking for
[38:37.400 --> 38:41.000]  I'm talking to my crew are our shots of newspapers we took them they're on in
[38:41.000 --> 38:47.520]  full wars.com and I want to show that in articles the difference I want to do a
[38:47.520 --> 38:52.560]  story the difference from England the difference from the US with the police
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.840]  versus Austria where they've got people shut down six miles out off major roads
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.960]  that go over the Alps and aren't letting people travel down those roads unless
[39:04.960 --> 39:08.120]  you are staying at one of the lodges nearby and then they come to your lodge
[39:08.120 --> 39:13.720]  and get in your face there this is just unprecedented but finally we did sell
[39:13.720 --> 39:19.200]  out of almost all survival shield nation I and our next to I walked in this
[39:19.200 --> 39:24.280]  morning and Weldon said yeah I took it off at 8 a.m. and then said sold out and
[39:24.280 --> 39:28.880]  I said she's sold out of every bottle and he said well we like to keep back
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.840]  about 200 for any breakage or any problems or any lost stuff and I said
[39:32.840 --> 39:36.920]  well it really be 200 well that many he goes no I just let keep a reserve and I
[39:36.920 --> 39:41.600]  said no sell them all I want to be totally sold out so there's 200 bottles

[40:08.280 --> 40:14.200]  product not as strong or pure it's not toxic and it doesn't have any additives
[40:14.200 --> 40:20.560]  or it's been tested it's totally clean it's just not 9999 iodine it's more

[41:23.280 --> 41:30.080]  amazing to be sitting here watching this but mainstream media it's come out on
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.000]  record is ordered not to cover Bilderberg they begrudgingly the last few
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.640]  years have been forced to cover it while making jokes about it they made jokes a
[41:37.640 --> 41:44.400]  few years ago about TPP being secret no one's laughing now when the top right
[41:44.400 --> 41:49.360]  hand story on drudge report.com is Bilderberg we salute drudge for helping
[41:49.360 --> 41:55.160]  break the blockade and get this information out we're going to expose
[41:55.160 --> 41:59.800]  the secret nature of this global private corporate government we're going to
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.320]  expose the entire agenda we're not going to back down this is news if 150 top
[42:05.320 --> 42:10.520]  movie stars were meeting in secret it'd be huge news if 150 soccer commissioners
[42:10.520 --> 42:15.440]  were meeting in secret it'd be big news if 150 NBA stars were meeting in secret
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.080]  it'd be big news if 150 NFL stars are meeting in secret it'd be huge news if
[42:20.080 --> 42:26.040]  150 top tennis players are meeting it'd be big news if 150 top scientists were
[42:26.040 --> 42:33.720]  meeting in secret it'd be big news the secret makes it even more sinister but
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.160]  the people have had the victory we forced it out in the open we forced to
[42:37.160 --> 42:41.080]  debate about it now we can get their annals now they're forced to release
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.000]  some of the information now they're forced out in the sun and what happens to
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.560]  Count Dracula when he is pulled out of his Austrian castle into High Noon
[42:49.560 --> 42:57.480]  Sun he politically lights up like a firebomb he explodes those are all
[42:57.480 --> 43:03.480]  allegories the vampires can't handle sunshine the vampires are predators
[43:03.480 --> 43:09.720]  well the vampire slayers politically peacefully are there covering the
[43:09.720 --> 43:13.920]  globalist that are taking over our world and the federal police of Austria are
[43:13.920 --> 43:19.640]  scurrying around like good little hunting wolves and it's not the first time
[43:19.640 --> 43:28.080]  Austria has served evil is it not the first time they had police dogs out
[43:28.080 --> 43:33.560]  harassing reporters not the first time you know we're in ended Austria it ended
[43:33.560 --> 43:37.520]  in a coup and the Nazi government coming and killing your your leader and
[43:37.520 --> 43:41.560]  overthrowing Austria well you're being overthrown by the EU you're being
[43:41.560 --> 43:46.680]  overthrown by Bilderberg group who set it up take your country back act with
[43:46.680 --> 43:55.840]  some honor not like disgusting filthy lap dogs and oh it was the Nazi Prince
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.640]  Bernhard the SS officer who founded Bilderberg so I guess you guys think
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.440]  it's cute that a million Austrians and 20 million Germans died in World War
[44:05.440 --> 44:12.320]  2 look what your black uniforms ended up costing you so don't act like fascist
[44:12.320 --> 44:17.640]  leave the press alone stop it that I need the phone numbers to the federal
[44:17.640 --> 44:21.000]  police in Austria I need the phone numbers of those local police as well
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.680]  I want to make a whole story out of that I want to call them on air today after
[44:24.680 --> 44:30.320]  the show and that they all speak English and demand demand that they act like
[44:30.320 --> 44:35.280]  human beings demand or at least get it on record that they're acting like SS
[44:35.280 --> 44:43.040]  thugs like Arnold Schwarzenegger's father all right let's go back to Rob do
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.240]  there in the Austrian Alps six miles away from Bilderberg where they've got
[44:48.240 --> 44:53.680]  checkpoints on the highways Rob do so while we were being interrogated right
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.320]  in front of our hotel they would a group would come up and they would talk to
[44:57.320 --> 45:02.680]  each other in German or Austrian German whatever whatever I like is and then the
[45:02.680 --> 45:06.200]  guy would translate in English I'm like well is he really saying that or are you
[45:06.200 --> 45:09.880]  just making that up I mean and it happens several times he would come up and say
[45:09.880 --> 45:16.840]  something to each over here now we don't want you to go up the road anymore you
[45:16.840 --> 45:23.680]  can only go down the road this is this is your cut-off yeah I would ask them
[45:23.680 --> 45:26.680]  while you're while your skype's breaking up I would ask them under what
[45:26.680 --> 45:31.480]  authority do you violate free movement so are you saying what areas in
[45:31.480 --> 45:37.080]  exclusion zone is there a Chernobyl taking place or something I mean are

[45:40.720 --> 45:45.760]  Austria under what authority do you operate I want your superior well and
[45:45.760 --> 45:49.040]  that is the whole secret they don't want anybody to know about this they just
[45:49.040 --> 45:52.000]  want to keep it under wraps and they get a lot of help from the media there's a
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.960]  publisher here of the it's called der standard his name's Oscar Bronner he's
[45:55.960 --> 46:04.360]  been to several Bilderberg meetings and he asked me not to oh okay 150 of the
[46:04.360 --> 46:07.960]  world's richest most powerful people get together and there's nothing to write
[46:07.960 --> 46:12.400]  about I mean that's just insane totally insane Rob you're Scott cut out what
[46:12.400 --> 46:17.920]  did you say about the publisher the publisher his name is Oscar Bronner and

[46:22.440 --> 46:26.240]  in Austria and he's been invited to several Bilderberg meetings and he is
[46:26.240 --> 46:29.920]  told that you don't write about this which is why he doesn't do it he goes
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.000]  well they asked me not to so I don't and that's his way of getting into the club
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.440]  and that's in the newspaper that's in the paper I mean they just admit all of
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.240]  this it's sick yeah but that's why you don't really hear about they talk about
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.680]  it in these esoteric terms they don't really get down to the meat and potatoes
[46:45.680 --> 46:48.680]  of what these guys are really discussing they go oh it's just they just want to
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.040]  get together and talk in private no big deal well no big deal why do you have
[46:53.040 --> 46:58.520]  2,000 cops running around the hillside climbing up the mountain bugging us when
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.960]  we're just in our apartment editing video I mean we're not criminals you know
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.480]  our our steak is a camera and our silver bullet is a microphone that's all we

[47:12.480 --> 47:15.800]  just they're just gonna keep ramping it up though I can already feel it there
[47:15.800 --> 47:19.040]  they're parked right as we left our apartment we shot a video going down
[47:19.040 --> 47:23.000]  from the apartment coming down to here past at least four different police
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.320]  vans and the checkpoint and they had some more out on the trails so it's just
[47:28.320 --> 47:31.360]  gonna keep continuing ramping up hey before we go to the break I just want
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.200]  to do a little x2 plug here I cut my finger on Saturday I put x2 on a bandaid
[47:36.200 --> 47:40.560]  almost completely healed up at this point but a little x2 on a bandaid wrapped
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.840]  it up two days almost gone I mean that it truly is by the way that is not a
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.480]  planned plug well everybody knows even the crummy iodine does miracles on
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.280]  cuts but yes that's what I use it for as well right and that happened on
[47:53.280 --> 47:57.960]  Saturday night so we're now Monday night two days later and it's it's you know

[48:20.800 --> 48:23.440]  prison-planet TV membership we really do appreciate it and we're gonna have a
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.800]  lot more to come I've got a whole the whole confrontation when the cops are
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.120]  asking us for our passports I have that on cell phone audio I started recording
[48:32.120 --> 48:35.960]  immediately as they started coming up well it looks like you have quite a bit
[48:35.960 --> 48:40.480]  of the video too we've already seen that it's on info wars calm right now right
[48:40.480 --> 48:43.560]  well I'm there's the second confrontation and if I could track that
[48:43.560 --> 48:46.200]  out other guy down who's at the guest stand at the apartment I think he was
[48:46.200 --> 48:50.040]  taking some pictures while we were surrounded by the cops absolutely well
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.400]  just just when you roll up the mountain to get footage at the checkpoint we've
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.440]  already got some of those photos they're on info wars calm now again if we can
[48:58.440 --> 49:02.800]  direct one of the document cams over here on the computer for TV viewers I
[49:02.800 --> 49:07.000]  can show you again over 3,000 people there to hear me speak and other speak
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.280]  and no arrest no problems and we're talking less than half a mile away up
[49:12.280 --> 49:18.240]  the hill to where Bilderberg was meeting outside London and Watford all you do is
[49:18.240 --> 49:24.800]  search engine Bilderberg Watford and you can see the whole thing there and all
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.040]  they needed was one car a police over the fence for us a fence that you could
[49:29.040 --> 49:33.440]  step over and it was no big deal that members of parliament come out and
[49:33.440 --> 49:38.360]  speak they have little fence they put up around the hotel itself which was
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.280]  pointless and there were no problems nothing happened this idea that
[49:42.280 --> 49:49.040]  demonstrators or media are somehow dirty and bad shows how to tell how to
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.960]  tell a terry in the leadership of these organizations are I mean it's simply
[49:53.960 --> 49:58.840]  disgusting in fact here's a great aerial photo of the 3,000 plus people of the
[49:58.840 --> 50:07.160]  police estimated from helicopter that were basically put in a area of the
[50:07.160 --> 50:11.600]  hotel's property in the corner for us to give our speeches that's how a free
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.080]  country operates I'm not saying England hasn't degenerated a lot but boy
[50:15.080 --> 50:19.240]  compared to Austria it's amazing Rob do take us out to break with any other
[50:19.240 --> 50:24.280]  points and I'm gonna come back and talk to Josh show and get his take yeah well
[50:24.280 --> 50:27.280]  I just want to say that we're not doing anything wrong we're just out here
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.600]  covering the fact that 150 of the biggest most powerful elites in the Western
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.840]  Hemisphere Europe Canada the United States are coming together for a meeting
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.200]  that they say is private yet they want to pay have forced taxpayers to pay for
[50:40.200 --> 50:43.960]  have to have 2,000 federal police running around here terrorizing people and
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.200]  that's wrong that's right and the people of Austria need to stand up and that's in
[50:47.200 --> 50:52.800]  the newspaper 2,000 federal police to guard a group that has no power but the
[50:52.800 --> 50:56.960]  media dare not report on it but drudge report dot com is reporting on it in

[54:17.560 --> 54:20.560]  try to settle down here a little bit because there's some really hardcore
[54:20.560 --> 54:25.040]  gun news you cannot make up this headline it's from right Bart this is
[54:25.040 --> 54:29.160]  exactly what the US code is now saying they put it in the federal register
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.240]  that's where laws come from now is out of Obama's mouth not even an executive
[54:33.240 --> 54:37.960]  order things just appear in the federal register Obama to circumvent Congress
[54:37.960 --> 54:43.200]  with gag order on firearm coverage and it says you will get government approval
[54:43.200 --> 54:47.600]  to talk about guns in any way that's what the NRA is saying about the
[54:47.600 --> 54:55.880]  analysis of it I agree with that analysis that is coming up truly insane
[54:55.880 --> 55:01.200]  meanwhile at this year's Builderburg meeting Google executive behind
[55:01.200 --> 55:05.840]  ingestible ID chips to attend Builderburg 2015 former DARPA director
[55:05.840 --> 55:10.600]  Regina Duggan to discuss artificial intelligence with global power brokers
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.440]  and we've got Josh Owen has been running camera but also a great journalist
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.800]  there on the ground with Rob do I wanted to get his take on what he's
[55:19.800 --> 55:26.240]  witnessed so far inside Austria compared to Builderburg he covered last year in
[55:26.240 --> 55:31.200]  what was it in Copenhagen Denmark and the footage he's seen from other events
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.600]  I've never seen personally such a police state response checkpoints six miles
[55:36.600 --> 55:44.120]  out and the police at your lodge simply amazing Josh Owens Josh Owens and
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.480]  fours.com yeah it's the juxtaposition here with how beautiful it is when we
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.360]  flew in I was you know jet lagged half asleep on the plane and all of a sudden
[55:53.360 --> 55:57.800]  through the clouds you see these snow peak mountains and these little rivers
[55:57.800 --> 56:01.520]  running down the mountain from the snow melting and it's just beautiful and then
[56:01.520 --> 56:05.320]  I was driving after we got our car I was driving through Innsbruck to Telfs and
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.160]  it was almost out of nowhere we had just started going up the mountain a ways
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.800]  away from our place we're staying and definitely a ways away from the interop
[56:14.800 --> 56:18.720]  in hotel where they're having Builderburg this year and all of a sudden we
[56:18.720 --> 56:23.160]  turned a corner and there's this big checkpoint with these huge cops just
[56:23.160 --> 56:30.480]  standing there and I don't know that the average demeanor of Austrian police but
[56:30.480 --> 56:36.480]  they didn't seem like they were messing around they seemed very angry and so they
[56:36.480 --> 56:42.200]  asked for our papers all all the while you're looking around at how beautiful
[56:42.200 --> 56:45.960]  this place is it's almost unbelievable it's almost cinematic like it's not
[56:45.960 --> 56:51.400]  even real like like it's a movie and then when we we go to our our little
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.240]  cabin and I'm looking out the window I have the window open letting the breeze
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.440]  blow in and all of a sudden you see them after what they've already confronted
[56:58.440 --> 57:04.440]  us once you see them marching down this hill eight or nine of them and I think
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.440]  the reason during the interaction I got so angry is because I didn't capture that
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.960]  on film because it looked literally like a movie they were marching down to our
[57:13.960 --> 57:17.680]  to our room and my a window was open and I had some of my equipment out getting
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.640]  ready to do the live show and they literally peered in the window and saw
[57:22.640 --> 57:25.560]  that we had a microphone and then they started speaking in German each other
[57:25.560 --> 57:30.920]  pointing out the microphone like I had some sauce like Ali Baba sword or some
[57:30.920 --> 57:33.680]  shotgun in there and they're like microphone microphone what is that what
[57:33.680 --> 57:40.520]  is that what is that and it's ridiculous it's completely I'm not saying that
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.680]  Copenhagen Denmark last year was was a cakewalk it was you know there were
[57:44.680 --> 57:50.360]  some issues there too they they detained me because the someone called the police
[57:50.360 --> 57:54.280]  to me for carrying a camera that was ridiculous but in the end you know they
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.080]  let us go and they weren't really being the Austrian intimidation that we've
[57:59.080 --> 58:04.160]  seen since we've been here well look out or Austria try to invasively invade us
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.680]  next invade the first amendment I mean I guess Hitler striking back it really
[58:08.680 --> 58:14.040]  shameful so any other observations we're gonna get to in 60 seconds 70 seconds
[58:14.040 --> 58:19.120]  when we start the next hour then we have a special guest joining us but you guys
[58:19.120 --> 58:24.360]  are welcome to go to other reports or go to bed I know it's been a long time
[58:24.360 --> 58:30.040]  since you've been asleep I know you left Sunday morning from Austin Texas but
[58:30.040 --> 58:34.280]  Doug Casey of Casey research can be joining us on the economy but when we
[58:34.280 --> 58:39.600]  come back we'll ask you how long it's been since Josh Owens slept you are
[58:39.600 --> 58:46.880]  listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today
[58:48.160 --> 58:53.720]  former DARPA director and now Google executive Regina Dugan will be
[58:53.720 --> 58:59.920]  attending the secretive 2015 Bilderberg conference this year in Austria Dugan
[58:59.920 --> 59:04.880]  who is helping to develop and promote the idea of implantable microchips will
[59:04.880 --> 59:09.760]  be there to head up the discussion on artificial intelligence Regina Dugan is
[59:09.760 --> 59:14.960]  also an advocate for ingestible microchips that's right tiny microchips
[59:14.960 --> 59:20.880]  inside little pills that users would swallow daily in order to obtain what
[59:20.880 --> 59:26.080]  Dugan describes as superpowers by having your entire body act as a
[59:26.080 --> 59:31.960]  biological authentication system for cell phones cars door locks and other
[59:31.960 --> 59:37.200]  devices and she is quick to point out that these microchip pills have already
[59:37.200 --> 59:42.240]  been approved by the FDA for the complete list of this year's Bilderberg
[59:42.240 --> 59:52.920]  attendees be sure to check out infowars.com you're listening to the Alex
[59:52.920 --> 59:55.800]  Jones show
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:11.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:19.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.880]  Alex Jones Bilderberg 2015 is kicked off with
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:32.480]  well some real sparks the horrible evil Josh Owens and Rob do men with no
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.720]  criminal records and long journalistic background histories have entered into
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.400]  Austria of course our names are all on list we announced who was going in to
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.120]  begin with and the Austrian police six miles away from where the Bilderberg
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:53.040]  groups can be meeting in four days have checkpoints on the roads and a bit
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.880]  harassing them going to their hotel sticking their head in their windows
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:05.120]  following them being I guess you could say aggressive and rude really
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:10.840]  unprecedented and Josh was getting to some of the other observations he made
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.560]  there Josh for me this is really big news that you got the group behind the
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.400]  EU the TPP the globalist the top globalist we're forcing the media to
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.080]  cover the Bilderbergs real and they're so arrogant they've ordered the police the
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.520]  federal police with taxpayers paying for it to harass reporters don't they know
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.720]  that continues to blow up in their face politically I mean the only other place
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.360]  that acted like this was Canada when they had me arrested for 15 hours for no
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.160]  reason and so I guess they might be dumb enough to actually arrest you so be
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.440]  really careful go ahead right yeah I mean I think it's almost as if they
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.920]  enjoy the villain appeal I mean look at this back here it's these the Alps with
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.880]  fog drifting up over the trees and then they're in this castle up there in the
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.040]  middle of nowhere I mean it really is like the villains layer in a movie it
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:10.760]  is it and don't forget who their security is cobra exactly it's it's
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.200]  unreal but just the icing on the cake and I know the guy who I'm who I'm
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.160]  about to mention is going to see this because he looked at the website there
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.880]  was literally a guy swear to God he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger the
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.160]  Terminator with his red eye popping out his machine eye popping out when he was
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.040]  telling us because we asked him what trails can we go on you know we were
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.400]  trying to comply and be nice because they were being so obsessively
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.800]  ridiculous and he was just like this is not for you this is not for you where
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.880]  you are now is as far as you can go this is not for you these trails are not for
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.840]  you all while his eye was pulsating this red like magma I I'm really upset that
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.040]  I didn't get any of this on they were trying to intimidate you and you know
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.160]  they saw what happened in World War two and I tried that I mean 20 million dead
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.800]  and we're not the ones they're threatening or being aggressive we're
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.560]  just simply trying to be free they want to follow the orders of evil people I
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.200]  don't know why they're obsessed with that but we're look there are a lot of
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.880]  good Austrians a lot of great Germans in fact probably more so than even
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.080]  Americans at least more Germans are awake politically they're either super
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.840]  evil or super good but I would talk to some locals and say do you like a secret
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:27.160]  global group meeting in secret and and and trying to run your life and I think
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.280]  you're gonna find the Austrians don't like it absolutely I'm sure that's
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.720]  definitely true and I'm in no way bashing every Austrian I'm just bashing
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.280]  this one guy I'm not really bashing I'm just telling him it's the stereotype
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.040]  it's what Estalyn said on air he said oh my gosh Austria is a horrible police
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.600]  state get ready and then off air he was like oh you better watch it Alex they're
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.640]  bad and now we're finding out man up you think I should it's not three miles
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.280]  down the road like the abortion clinic should I jump on there plenty come out
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:02.200]  there I don't know I think I'm tempted I mean I'm just gonna get my face I'm
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:07.840]  sick of it man I mean just say to him what's your problem I'm here trying to
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.000]  cover this this is of National Park are you saying I don't have access that's a
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.680]  human rights violation I think you should push him Josh if I was you push him
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.960]  politically with your rights as a as a citizen under the Geneva Convention tell
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.480]  him that so you're gonna violate the Geneva and Nuremberg conventions again
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.360]  ask him that all right absolutely I will after after 24 plus hours of no
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.920]  sleep I'm a little bit jet lag but let me get a no no yeah don't do it tonight

[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.440]  school field trip consisted of a sack lunch and a trip to the zoo but now
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.360]  they've upped the ante in places like Minneapolis where a private school is
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:15.120]  taking their kids to a sex shop that's right multiple news outlets reporting
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.240]  that parents are demanding school chiefs removal after she took a group to the

[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.040]  statement guide democratic schools board of directors stands behind the premise
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.600]  of the field trip the statement said we view it as a legitimate learning

[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:30.080]  we're going to be talking to a multi-time number one New York Times best-selling author
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.600]  Doug Casey he's been a guest here several times but familiar with his work
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.520]  for 25 years without a chance to speak at one of his events in San Antonio I
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:47.480]  guess it was last year time just flies KCresearch.com and of course he is the
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.960]  best-selling author known for exposing how to be an international person now
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.080]  that's the opposite of being a globalist the globalist want one global
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.200]  system that central banks control where there is no freedom the
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.560]  international man knows how to work outside of that system and stay one
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.920]  step ahead of them plus the globalists like to leave escape valves escape
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:17.400]  hatches kind of like and they live with the watches for themselves and his
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.840]  books his newsletters his information helps expose all of that he is the
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.120]  cutting edge of that we have so many expert guests on and they say you know
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.320]  who I listen to Doug Casey so we're honored to have him this would the
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:35.120]  backdrop of the globalist setting up the TPP that Congress can't read that sets
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.640]  up one-sided trade deals for insiders since there's the internet tries to
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.680]  in cash globally tries to track all transactions it's simply out of control
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.960]  we have our reporters at Bilderberg where these hundred to fifty crony
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.960]  capitalist are meeting and six miles out from the meeting house four days till
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.520]  it starts they've got checkpoints on the highways those videos all of that is up
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:05.040]  on info wars.com prisonplanet.com and drudgereport.com on the top of the
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.320]  right-hand side has Bilderberg 2015 full attendee list and agenda elitist
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.800]  confab discuss artificial intelligence so we'll be breaking that down coming up
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.640]  in the third hour getting into speaking of executive power grabs we reported on
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.680]  this Saturday you don't believe us or the NRA Breitbart has their headline
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:30.640]  Obama to circumvent Congress with gag order that's quote on firearm coverage
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.440]  so they're now saying firearms are so dangerous we'll decide what speech is
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.840]  allowed with guns we're going to put at the federal register by the state
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.760]  department the same people that banned putting the design for 3d 3d
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.640]  printable guns last year they said we'll indict anyone in the world who puts
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.240]  these designs on the internet as if they are the global power just like the US
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.600]  just indicted you know 40 plus FIFA members which I'm sure there's some
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.960]  corruption but this is like Satan sitting in judgment of a low level
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.240]  demon you know staker tail or whatever low level demon that can't even you know
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.440]  wipe its nose this is like Hitler sitting in judgment at Nuremberg on the
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.720]  Nazi Party I mean this is or Heinrich Himmler or Hermann Göring or Zeb
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:25.640]  Dietrich I mean this is just a mind-spinning joke to see all of this
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.840]  unfolding the good news is it's in the headlines today we'll talk about this
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.720]  Obama was to bring any legals give them free everything as a new voting block
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.000]  I'm for sovereignty but but I'm for having borders somewhat open
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.320]  international travel if you don't have welfare but if you have a bunch of
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.800]  welfare people will come there they'll use it they'll implode you and that's
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.880]  the plan of course but federal courts now three of them have ruled that Obama
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.000]  just saying borders are open magically is illegal so he's now publicly backed
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.320]  off that initiative but Soros is still funding it we've got that news as well
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.840]  Doug Casey is the chairman of Casey research best-selling author world-renowned
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.480]  speculator and libertarian philosopher Doug Casey has garnered a well-earned
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.480]  reputation for his insights into politics economics and investment markets
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.280]  that was widely respected as one of the preeminent authorities on rational
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.880]  speculation especially in the high potential natural resource sector Doug
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.720]  literally wrote the book on profiting from periods of economic turmoil which
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.360]  were entering big time his book crisis investing spent multiple weeks on the
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.000]  number one New York Times best-selling list and became the best-selling
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.600]  financial book of 1980 surpassing a big caliber names like free to choose by
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.080]  Milton Friedman and the real war by Richard Nixon and cosmos by Carl Sagan
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.560]  cosmos Casey research calm okay I threw out a cornucopia Doug of things that
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.720]  are happening things that are going on two weeks ago I tried to get you on the
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.840]  show about some international issues taking place but and the war on people
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:05.520]  trying to expatriate and capital control starting to go in big global banks are
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.240]  meeting openly saying in cash what do you make of all this activity where is the
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.160]  state of the world economy right now and what is Doug Casey doing to protect
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:23.040]  himself well Alex it's great to be here and I agree with everything you said so
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:29.640]  far and enjoy listening to you as far as what's going to happen let me give you a
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.720]  quote from Ray Bradbury he said something wicked this way comes and that's
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.280]  exactly what's going on in the world today I'm just about every front the
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:46.800]  military front the economic front the social front the political front we're
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:55.000]  really heading into something really nasty so it's a it's a matter of great
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.320]  concern and I think that your listeners shouldn't just be listening they should
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.080]  be acting about this because there's an excellent chance that even a year from
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.880]  now even six months from now it could be a month from now the whole world is
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:18.360]  going to be turned inside inside out and upside down a lot of different ways so
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.760]  where should we start what you want I'm going to give you the floor start
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.400]  wherever you want well I have to agree with you first of all what you said
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:36.520]  about pipe up most Americans really don't give a damn about soccer I mean
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:42.120]  most of what we know about soccer relates back to Brandy Chastain back in
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.840]  1999 when she ripped her jersey off and displayed a wonderful body yes when she
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.920]  scored that winning goal against the Chinese women team in a Pfeiffer tournament
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:58.480]  but you know so they're making a big deal out of a bribery scandal and Pfeiffer
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.160]  but you know most people are unaware that the Pfeiffer is a is a private group
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:10.880]  it's been around for a hundred years is controlled by the guys that run it okay
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:17.920]  that's fine their main job is to designate what the rules are for
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.320]  football and where the World Cup is going to be played and money's passed
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:29.920]  around because their obligation is to these 200 and some government
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.960]  organizations that control soccer in various countries so what's the big
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.640]  deal here I mean sure they're paying themselves well but it's nothing
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.760]  compared to the kind of theft that goes on with governments themselves well
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.360]  sure I mean I mean the big banks spend like two billion dollars of the three
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.960]  billion spent in a US election operation and really from what I've seen
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.280]  that's all they're doing is going in and giving money to local sporting
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.880]  organizations as part of a profit sharing operation it just seems like the
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:05.800]  mafia that runs our country thinks it controls the whole world well that's
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:12.120]  right Alex and that is the most disturbing thing about it 99% of all
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:18.560]  the people that watch soccer that play soccer all the soccer that's played it's
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:24.000]  all outside of the United States and these people they've indicted they're
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.920]  all foreigners and it's like the the US government of all people has become the
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:38.160]  world's of moral arbitar arbiter and the world's policeman where they're
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:44.960]  actually going to foreign governments and getting these foreign citizens
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:51.720]  extradited to stand trial back in the US for violating American laws and their
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:58.520]  nonsense laws like money laundering which only became a crime was
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:04.440]  manufactured as a crime only about 30 years ago and I mean this is this is
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.040]  this is all shocking I mean nobody's safe anywhere in the world from the the
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.680]  reach of the US government anymore this is just one more example it's the same
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:24.560]  classes last year when the US sent a swap team into New Zealand to attack him
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:30.360]  dot com was a German citizen and was violating no laws either in New Zealand
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.480]  or sure let's expand on that a law let's IRS these accounts on suspicion no
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.960]  crime required that's the money laundering law that's written to be so
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:44.120]  broad outside of law a 40-plus year Mexican restaurant that's got like eight
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.720]  seats deposits the cash every day they admit the cash is all clean they're
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.800]  putting it in the bank so they steal the woman's $37,000 life savings and I mean
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.480]  it's just crazy what our government's turned into yeah it is it's really it's
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:06.400]  really turned into a cancer that's metastasizing and it's taken on a life
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:13.080]  of its own at this point it's a great matter of concern it's one reason why I
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:20.080]  really emphasize internationalizing yourself so that you're not totally under
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.080]  the control of the US government I mean the risk in the financial markets is
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:32.400]  extreme but it's nothing compared to the political risk that you have from your
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:39.080]  own government is very very disturbing what is expiring the power trip to have
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.280]  art you know you're an expert on this our government starting a war with Russia
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.000]  starting a war with China and we're not lionizing Russia or China but they're not
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.600]  the ones aggressively especially Russia doing this and even came out mainstream
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.600]  news today that our government admits they tried to overthrow Egypt our ally
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:01.120]  and put the Muslim Brotherhood in so now Egypt's joined Russia and doing joint
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:08.000]  naval patrols why would they double cross 35 year allies and put radicals in
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.480]  the chop Christians heads off has our government gone criminally insane I think
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:20.200]  that's a reasonable way to describe it actually Alex and looking at this
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:27.360]  blue in the eastern Ukraine what we have there are two provinces that are
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.440]  populated mainly by Russian speakers the Ukraine isn't a real country anyway it's
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:42.040]  kind of a it's kind of a it's kind of a political title intertidal zone where a
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:50.360]  bunch of nationalities are caught between Russia and Romania and so forth so
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:56.120]  these two provinces want to split off from the bankrupt and corrupt Ukrainian
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:02.760]  government and become independent and the US is backing the corrupt Ukrainian
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:09.000]  government in making these two provinces stay part of the Ukraine I mean this is
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.480]  a this is just crazy and they're trying to implicate the Russians in this of
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.520]  course but the Russians are sympathetic to these people because they're they're
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:26.640]  also Russians and they'd like to see a border country in between them and the
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.480]  Ukraine which of course the Americans are trying to get into NATO but a
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.680]  you know this is like asking to start World War three it really is criminally
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:44.200]  insane you again are the best selling author who broke down how to be an
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.840]  international individual seeing this whole thing coming and you've seen
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.320]  booms and bust you've been credited for making folks a lot of money that listen
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.360]  to your strategies and I want to get some of those strategies with you coming up
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.520]  in the next segment but in the eight or nine minutes before we go to break Doug
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.520]  Casey of Casey research calm looking at all the world news and this
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.800]  acceleration towards classical totalitarianism do you think it's a
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.840]  conscious move or just the fact that different political elites have nothing
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.320]  holding them back they've gotten away with so much and so they're just
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.040]  slouching into a form of fascistic decadence well they're definitely doing
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:31.240]  that but I guess the question is is it a conscious move or is it just something
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:38.320]  that happens with a life of its own and I think it's a result of the fact that
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.840]  that you've got two kinds of people in the world you've got people that like to
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:49.120]  control physical reality and I like those kind of people they there would
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.960]  improve the world and then you've got another class of people and those are
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.520]  people that like to control other people and that's the type of person that gets
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:04.400]  into government that goes into politics so actually it's not the best and the
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.440]  brightest people to go into government it's the lowest and and mostly graded
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.240]  types that are attracted to the seat of power where they can control other
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:20.680]  people so since that's the nature of a government that it just that it that it
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:29.000]  attracts that type of personality it's inevitable that government becomes worse
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.520]  and more malignant as time goes on and sure and our system as you know was the
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:40.520]  founders who were the opposite true Renaissance men and women they wanted a
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:45.360]  small government set up to try to keep that at bay for a while the problem is
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:50.360]  the paradox that free system not perfect but freer than any other created so much
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:55.520]  wealth that the government even though it had a small tax became large and fat
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.440]  and arrogant the people became decadent and now we're about to wake up
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.240]  homeless on the continent our forebearers conquered yeah I agree with you
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:10.600]  the situation has actually gotten out of control and the government is so big
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.880]  and so powerful at this point that it can't be reversed you know even if Ron
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:22.360]  Paul was elected the last time it wouldn't have done any good because the
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.080]  first thing that would have happened to him I believe that he would have been
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:30.440]  sat down by the heads of various praetorian agencies like the NSA and
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:36.360]  the CIA and the FBI and a dozen others like that plus a bunch of generals and
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.400]  admirals and they would have told him the way the game is played and if he
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.040]  didn't play it his life would be at risk and if for some reason he dodged those
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:52.320]  bullets he'd be indicted by the by the US Congress and if for some reason that
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.880]  didn't work the average American would be out in the street rioting because his
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:00.560]  rice bowl was going to be broken because the average American at this point
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.800]  gets more from the government than he pays in taxes now that not that I believe
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.040]  we should even have taxes sure but that's where I was gonna go next is they
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.320]  probably he'd make some economic announcement they manipulate the stock
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.480]  market that's on record now they would just dive it for a week claim he did it
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.440]  and all these fools would then say run him out on a rail they would support his
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:26.800]  impeachment yeah I think you're right Alex and I'm afraid that when the next
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:33.920]  crisis really blows up in the next little while the American people
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.880]  boobus americana's HL Mike and said is gonna clamor for somebody to kiss it
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.600]  all and make it better we get very well wind up with some type of a military
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:49.040]  dictatorship in this country is the next step well that's what General Tommy
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:55.080]  Franks told cigar aficionado in 2013 hmm I'm a fan of cigar aficionado do you
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:01.120]  like cigars too I do like them and I and of course the type I like they try to
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.440]  embargo that's right well when I see you next we're gonna have to sit down over
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.800]  a whiskey and a cigar and chat about all this stuff at the at leisure but of
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:18.280]  course tobacco is becoming illegal in this country so we might have to smoke
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.640]  that cigar someplace outside of the US it's amazing from land of the free home
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.040]  of the brave to the land of what would you call America now there's still a lot
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.360]  of great people here you know I was running down I'd call most of them whip dogs
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.280]  at this point they're whipped dogs and when somebody in the uniform points a
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.880]  finger at them they roll over on their backs and wet themselves it's absolutely
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:47.800]  disgusting I mean the idea of America is dead in the United States at this point
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.560]  it certainly is and the constabulary itself are a bunch of whip dogs scared
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:58.000]  following orders I do see though in the federal government and at state levels
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.600]  we get a lot of leaks a lot of good intel as bad as the government is per
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.960]  capita there are more awake people I'm finding now in government because they
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.960]  know that things are getting really corrupt then I even see in the general
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:16.960]  population so I I do find that people in government finally realize and and
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.760]  understand something wicked this way comes yeah you're right Alex but what
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.280]  I'll tell you what concerns me it's that the good people that are in
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:34.360]  government I think they're being driven out by the bad people in other words a
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:40.240]  decent person is born more bad people gravitate towards the government he
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.960]  doesn't want to be in that environment it scares them with good reason he wants
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.840]  to go out to someplace else where he's not surrounded by criminal
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.760]  personalities so I mean that's another reason why I think it's getting worse I
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.920]  hate to be so negative we got to be honest and that's what founded America
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.560]  talk about your philosophy what made you come up with this international man idea
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:06.080]  that became you know really a sensation still is today for record number of ex
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.840]  patriots and others when did when did the worm turn for you or were you always
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:16.600]  that way Doug Casey well you know like yourself I'm a I'm a libertarian I
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:23.120]  believe in free minds and free markets and I think I was born that way quite
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:34.320]  frankly it may be some type of a genetic mutation for all I know but the thing is
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:40.320]  that all of our ancestors all of us who are Americans they all came here from
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:47.040]  foreign countries and everybody our ancestors came to America because they
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:52.800]  wanted to get away from being turned into slaves and different countries around
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:59.880]  the world the problem is is that the US government since it's going in the same
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  direction as those governments that our ancestors right ran away from now we have
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.080]  to run away from we have to go someplace else ourselves we have to like find a new
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:18.600]  America or someplace but King George the 10th knows we're running away and so
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.920]  now our own government's creating a global government to try to capture
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.760]  everyone yeah it's right that's that's right because we can try to run but we
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:37.200]  can't hide I mean the fact that at this point it's very very hard almost impossible
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:42.080]  for an American to open up a foreign bank or brokerage account means that
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.480]  we're trapped like lobsters here in the United States now of course most
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.040]  Americans think I say I don't want to leave America this is the greatest
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:57.320]  country in the world and it certainly used to be but you no longer even have
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.800]  the option of living somewhere else because if you can't open up a foreign
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.080]  bank or brokerage account how are you going to get your money out of the
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:14.640]  country I mean if the the the various exits possible exits if you want to take
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:19.840]  advantage of them are closing almost daily you're right Doug Casey Casey
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.240]  research.com stay there we're going to come back in the next segment and get
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.240]  into solutions and your prognosis for the future. What's wrong you don't like a

[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:04.240]  Former DARPA director and now Google executive Regina Dugan will be attending
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.680]  the secretive 2015 Bilderberg conference this year in Austria. Dugan who is helping
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:15.440]  to develop and promote the idea of implantable microchips will be there to
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:20.440]  head up the discussion on artificial intelligence. Regina Dugan is also an
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:25.560]  advocate for ingestible microchips that's right tiny microchips inside
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:31.320]  little pills that users would swallow daily in order to obtain what Dugan
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:37.080]  describes as superpowers by having your entire body act as a biological
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:43.440]  authentication system for cell phones cars door locks and other devices and
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.440]  she is quick to point out that these microchip pills have already been
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.960]  approved by the FDA. For the complete list of this year's Bilderberg attendees

[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:23.680]  them here in just a moment it has to be individual philosophy of liberty voting
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.040]  with your dollars promoting freedom defending it staunchly getting in the
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.760]  face of government or corporations or others that trample on those rights or
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:39.160]  you will be usurped you will be taken over like a vacuum you create a vacuum
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.600]  down at 100 feet underwater the water is going to figure out a way to get in
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.240]  there nature abhors a vacuum and if you don't stand up and promote the
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.000]  principles of freedom if you don't jealously guard that jewel as Thomas
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.080]  Jefferson said you will wake up homeless on the continent your forebearers
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.720]  conquered quote Thomas Jefferson yet again I was quoting him earlier and
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.440]  didn't want to plagiarize we are at that crossroads in fact we've already gotten
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.440]  to the crossroad and started going down the road to absolute serfdom the road
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.840]  to total tyranny we can still look back and see the fork but we go much further
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:24.800]  there if we go back it's going to be overgrown and there's a rock slide in
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:30.000]  the way that's what happens politically societally historically we've almost
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.600]  reached the point of a return and then there are avenues for us through the
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:41.200]  path we're going down if we survive it if pockets of freedom persist through the
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:50.480]  gates of hell that were entering Mordor Hades if we survive this trip across the
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:55.040]  River Styx from the death of freedom I guess there could be some fiery Phoenix
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.600]  on the other side that rises again it'll probably make our metal that much
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:05.960]  stronger it was great tyranny that caused our forebearers to stand up in 1776 but
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:13.560]  they faced a financial tyranny a military tyranny not a cultural malaise a
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:23.720]  diseased filthy decadence a soul rotting collectivism the welfare doll that was
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.320]  used to control citizens of Rome there was not a big welfare system in King
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.720]  George's day except for those allied with the throne there was not a general
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:39.800]  welfare system written in to be inverted to basically create a
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.080]  domesticated population so we'll talk about the way out of this with Doug
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:50.680]  Casey in a moment and if I use biblical and epic legendary terms it's because
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.720]  we're in an epic time I mean they're on the news now saying everybody's going to
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.400]  get microchips to buy and sell they're on the news announcing world government
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.560]  they're on the news we're releasing GMO salmon in the ocean that they say will
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.800]  extinct the natural salmon they're on the news just breaking down huge
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.440]  developments and the elite are on a power trip they think they're invincible
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:17.280]  my god we'll be lucky of any of us survive Hitler thought he was invincible
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.520]  Stalin linen I mean just there's hundreds of these guys and this elite is
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:28.440]  that much more megalomaniacal than even predecessors because the technology used
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:34.920]  by them is a double-edged sword it just allows them to really have a lot of
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:41.120]  omnipresent powers the problem is they're still humans using and that's what
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.560]  makes it that much more destructive we'll talk about that with Doug Casey
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.640]  Casey research comm in a moment about crisis investing and more but before we
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.440]  go any further we have the nightly news share that's getting ready to launch on
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.520]  cable and TV very very soon I've just got so many projects on my plate but it

[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.640]  minutes thank you for holding during that I know you don't ever want to come
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.040]  on and put your own horn about your books about your newsletters about your
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.160]  invaluable research that's cutting edge tell us about some of the research
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.440]  materials you've got available for the public at Casey research talk about some
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.880]  of your books and then get into what you're doing to get prepared what you
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:41.000]  think this monster is it's coming down the road at us this mad dog and how you
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.160]  and others are getting prepared why are the elites in the Guardian now buying
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.920]  armored redoubts underground bunkers running to New Zealand I mean when the
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:56.120]  elite themselves are split in the scene they may have cooked this goose a little
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:04.680]  too much man kill the golden goose Doug Casey where to start Alex you know one
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:09.840]  thing I was thinking about as you were talking earlier and there's it's the fact
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.680]  that governments around the world at this point are trying to get rid of cash
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:26.440]  in other words paper currency and there there's a movement on that since
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:35.520]  everybody has a cell phone today to use the cell phone to to aviate even credit
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.480]  cards and certainly aviate cash so that everything you buy or sell has to go
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.280]  through your bank account at that point the government knows exactly what you're
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.880]  doing what you're buying and what you're selling because there would be no cash
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:42:00.480]  anymore to to even buy a candy bar quite frankly now this is a very disturbing
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.880]  trend that's taken root just over the last year or two and accelerating
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:12.960]  rapidly all over the world but what do you do about that one thing that you
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:19.880]  should do about it I think is buy for your personal possession of gold and
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:26.640]  silver coins at this point gold and silver have been used as money throughout
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.640]  history for lots of good reasons and they will continue to be used as money in
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:40.480]  the future so for the sake of your personal privacy you want to own a lot
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:49.560]  of gold and silver I think it'll aviate the government's efforts to make all
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:56.560]  money transfers electronic so that's just a thought and I'll point out right
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:03.600]  now that as we speak right now both of those metals are once again in a very
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:09.820]  reasonable buying zone silver is about $16 gold is about $1,175
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:17.680]  an ounce I think the next step is up for both of them from this from this point
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:23.640]  forward so I think that all of your listeners ought to have a significant
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:29.560]  stash of gold and silver coins put away in the safest place that they can think
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:35.440]  of so that's one piece of advice that I'd recommend and by the way as you know
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.880]  it's come out in the news what you and others said years ago the big central
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.440]  banks have been naked shorting gold and silver artificially driving down its
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:51.760]  price while they buy it and hoard it well yeah it's it's very
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:59.280]  problematical in the world there are about six billion ounces of gold that
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.320]  have been mined since the dawn of history we don't know exactly how many
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:07.160]  ounces of gold there are in the world but the best estimates are about six
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.160]  billion ounces of gold in other words less than an ounce for every man woman
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:16.680]  and child in the country so I think it's incumbent upon everybody to have at
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:22.320]  least amounts of gold in their own possession better 10 or 20 or 100 or
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:28.240]  more ounces of gold in their possession I think the price of gold is going up
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:37.440]  and the price of silver perhaps even more so that's step number one but step
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:43.920]  number two is because all of these governments are creating trillions of
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:50.200]  new currency units this isn't just the US government starting with the QE one
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:55.280]  and QE two and the bailouts and tarp and all this type of thing but the
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.440]  Europeans are doing the same thing the Japanese and the Chinese so this is a
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:06.600]  worldwide phenomenon and the next step I think is the greater depression gets
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:12.080]  worse in the next few years it's going to be much higher levels of inflation it's
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:18.080]  going to be much worse than things were in 2008 and 2009 and also much
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.480]  different but one of the advantages I'm trying to look at the bright side of
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.880]  of they're destroying all these national currencies is it's going to create more
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:33.320]  bubbles in the economy and right now as we speak we're in the biggest financial
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.200]  bubble in history and it's in the bond market interest rates have been driven
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:47.280]  down to zero actually zero in some cases which means the bond prices are at an
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:53.360]  all-time high so I think the next step is that the bond market crashes and
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.760]  that's much more serious than the stock market crashing but it'll bring the
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.960]  stock market down to and it'll bring the real estate market down with it quite
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:07.600]  possibly because unfortunately in the US and most of the Western world real
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:12.720]  estate floats on a sea of debt and if you can't borrow at reasonable
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:18.040]  interest rates you really can't buy or sell interest rate real estate because
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:24.520]  most houses have mortgages against them today so it's a serious problem but it's
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:29.040]  a problem that presents opportunities because although most people are going
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.760]  to lose most of what they have it's going to be possible to capitalize on that
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:43.440]  and as a speculator to win from the unwinding of all these things and people
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.600]  can specifically go to KCresearch.com and see some of the strategies you've
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.200]  been employing well we have a lot of free publications we have paid
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.640]  publications too that have specific stock recommendations but in terms of
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:05.000]  general advice we've got a huge amount of free information that I urge
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.320]  people to access to start thinking about these things and start moving because
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:16.880]  you know the problem is that a lot of people that listen to you and for that
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:23.040]  matter listen to me they think about these things but they don't act and I
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.680]  think the time is getting short for action and what form of action should
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:37.200]  they take putting aside a significant amount of savings in precious metals is
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.440]  the first and most important thing second thing is if you can if you're in a
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:47.480]  financial position to do so diversify your assets internationally so all of
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:53.840]  your wealth isn't under the control of just the US government and three would
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:00.200]  be to look for ways to capitalize on what they're doing
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:07.200]  speculations that will profit from all the money creation going on so you don't
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:12.440]  want to be a deer in the headlights this is the time for action let's talk about
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.280]  deer in the headlights because every financial expert out there says
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.760]  obviously the trillions and derivatives the quadrillions the the velocity of
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.680]  money the QE unlimited the currency race at the bottom what's happening with the
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.440]  bond markets that it's a bubble bubbles that will pop and then it runs from bad
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:35.080]  to worse but because of all their high-frequency trading and plunge
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:39.360]  protection teams and other manipulations they're able to build this bubble I
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:45.160]  think to a level never before seen 80 you agree with that statement is it
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:56.320]  wrong and what's going on right now is is building up to something much bigger
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:04.200]  than what happened during the last depression from 1929 to 1946 it's much
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.480]  bigger much more serious and governments are much more powerful than they were
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:17.520]  back then so it's hold on to your hat time and I think we're right at the edge
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.520]  of the we're right at the edge of the precipice right now but I don't think
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.400]  both people are even aware of that because when you walk outside you do
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.920]  further shining children are still playing maybe the occasional cop is
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:38.760]  beating one with a night stick but you can go down to the Walmart and buy cheap
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:44.880]  goods everything looks pretty good on the surface but I think it's a hologram
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:51.320]  that's about to be exposed at this point and that's why the elite are digging
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.360]  into armored bunkers that well what are they thinking is going to come I mean we
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.760]  can now you talk to a lot of really wealthy people but these are real
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.640]  entrepreneurs that actually go out and explore and mine and drill and build
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:08.560]  things they're not the parasite variety but I know a lot of those folks that
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:15.040]  aren't parasites they're also preparing escape plans as well well so much of what
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.960]  goes on in the world today is financed by the US government in other words yeah
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:25.360]  you're you're quite correct about that there is cause for optimism of course it's
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:32.000]  that there are two reasons why things have been getting better despite the
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.760]  depredations of government with its taxes and its regulation that's current
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:40.760]  let's end on a positive note starting to rub Doug Casey Casey research calm let's
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.440]  come back and talk about the flip side for every action is an opposite and
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.840]  equal reaction we've been talking about the problem and some of the solutions
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.720]  but yeah what are the optimistic positive things with our final segment
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:58.240]  with Doug Casey the legend straight ahead I'm Alex Jones info wars dot com
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.000]  communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US

[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:26.360]  alright final second with Doug Casey I'm gonna get into economic news world news
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:31.280]  huge attacks on the second amendment and more and open the phones up in the
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.400]  third hour we're also gonna get another update and see if there's been some
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:37.960]  developments that may be taking place in Austria covering Bilderberg but Doug
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:42.520]  Casey getting into the optimistic good things that are happening despite
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:47.680]  corporate combines that work with government to basically freeze society
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.680]  in a new dark age the Renaissance continues so go ahead and finish up with
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:55:00.040]  some positive notes Doug Casey yeah thanks Alex two things actually are the
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:05.200]  main springs of human progress and cause for tremendous optimism number one is
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.760]  that the average person understands that he has to produce more than he
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.000]  consumes and save the difference and that builds capital the excess of
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.880]  production over consumption and every individual knows he has to do that for
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:28.120]  his own life and as you set that aside that builds capital which allows
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:34.560]  civilization to progress the second thing is science and technology there are
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:41.240]  more scientists and engineers alive today than have lived in all of previous
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.680]  history put together and they're inventing things they're discovering
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.880]  things and that's what really makes life better and that ties in with the
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:58.600]  capital saved by average people because you need capital in order to do science
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:04.200]  and engineering the problem is this and how the government could destroy these
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.760]  two main springs of human progress is when the average guy saves what does he
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:16.800]  save it he saves in his currency and he saves in dollars but what happens if the
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:22.800]  government destroys the national currency by inflating it you wake up
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.640]  you've got a hundred thousand dollars in the bank that you are planning on
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:32.040]  retiring on that's a hundred thousand dollars that's available for entrepreneurs
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:36.960]  to borrow or that you can invest in stocks and so forth but if that money is
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:42.400]  destroyed like a Zimbabwe dollar might was destroyed a few years ago that
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.320]  capital has vanished now your retirement is gone and the capital for the
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:54.440]  scientists and engineers is also gone so it's a double whammy and the force that's
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:02.600]  doing that is the government by inflating the currency so there's cause for lots of
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:09.600]  optimism for the two reasons I mentioned savings and technological progress but
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.920]  the state could destroy both of those things by destroying the value of the
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:19.800]  dollar I hope I've been clear as to how that would work but so it's kind of a
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:28.280]  good news bad news kind of thing well Doug I I agree with you I I mean I
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:34.040]  totally agree with you that that that this is going on and I just hope the
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.360]  general public realizes that they're in great peril if they don't get involved
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:44.120]  in trying to basically inform others but it almost seems like either somebody
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:48.040]  cares in Aintley or they don't care I mean I'm not really into predestination
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:52.560]  and when it comes to my soul or when it comes to other things but it does make
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.000]  you wonder why some people will not get involved promoting freedom even if their
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.680]  life depends on it like I try to tell people that major shopping carts have
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.280]  cookies they know whether you're a big spender they know of your smart shopper
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:12.160]  they will charge you more depending on your habits I put a video out on that a
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:15.520]  bunch of commenters said I was making it up even though it was in mainstream news
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.520]  I mean it's like there seems to be a inverse instinct to want to be cheated
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:25.120]  and screwed over maybe these people just don't want to believe they're being
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:31.600]  screwed over it's just crazy well I don't know where it's gonna end Alex but
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:35.480]  we're gonna find out the next couple years we are Doug Casey do five more
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.720]  minutes with us I know you gotta go I want you to finish up back in 60 seconds

[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:07.080]  good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:12.000]  experienced it for themselves the bad news is for the first time in more than
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.280]  a year supplies in info wars life comm of survival shield X2 nascent iodine are
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:22.160]  running low but what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:29.000]  crystals that exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.800]  info wars life comm and that supply is running low and is in question that's
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.480]  why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.360]  of survival shield nascent iodine X2 today available exclusively at info

[01:59:49.600 --> 02:00:08.280]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:15.880]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:22.760]  network and now and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Doug you were
[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:25.840]  trying to make a point as we hit that break again tons of news coming up the
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:32.000]  next segment Doug Casey Casey research is our guest Doug looking at this
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.680]  situation finish up that point you were trying to make and then I wanted to ask
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:42.080]  you in closing in your gut you know promoting liberty for 40-something
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:45.520]  years what do you think's gonna end up happening to humanity because we could
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.800]  have government crazies and others make mistakes of the past and then it would
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.800]  just be you know 100 million dead in World War two or it'd be mousing tongue
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:58.200]  killing 84 million of his own people because leftists in the CIA help put
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:03.000]  him in power but now with nuclear weapons and all the rest of it I mean
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.720]  these control freaks really could destroy everything we've got a report on
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.320]  info wars comm coming up in the next segment after you leave us where
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:15.920]  Bilderberg is inviting Hillary's chief of staff to the event she was at Bilderberg 20
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:23.640]  I mean 2008 I mean is this really the best the elite can give us Doug Casey I
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:29.360]  don't know Alex there's cause for optimism but perhaps at this moment a
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:38.120]  lot more cause for pessimism all I can tell you is what I do myself you know it's
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:44.920]  funny I go on shows like yours and I say these things and I ask myself why am I
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:51.480]  doing it I'm a rich guy I don't really have anything to gain I mean I have a
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:58.200]  publishing business where I talk about these things but the risk reward of
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:03.080]  saying things that run counter to the mainstream is getting a little bit out
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:07.640]  of whack and I ask myself why am I taking the risk to even say these things
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:14.720]  and I guess the reason is I actually believe in karma what goes around come
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:20.480]  comes around and I think that if out of the people that are listening only one
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:25.280]  or two people something twigs in their mind and they start thinking and start
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:31.200]  investigating it's a good karma thing on the one hand I believe in the French
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:38.400]  phrase which means basically what he you can save himself or every man for
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:46.200]  himself but on the other hand I really do believe in karma and trying to make
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:52.240]  people aware of the problems in the world today so they're in a position to
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.200]  save themselves I think things are gonna get really grim I think they're gonna
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:04.800]  get really grizzly over the next few years I mean that's all I can say and I
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:08.200]  say these things it's not particularly to my advantage it's not even to your
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:14.800]  advantage to say these things because it's pinning targets on our back on our
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.680]  backs in today's world but well Doug Doug I mean I mean I can answer your
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:24.680]  question for you so you don't know why you do it I've psychoanalyzed myself it's
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.640]  not that I'm some goody two-shoes fake bleeding heart they've got studies out
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:32.440]  that the fake bleeding hearts are six times more likely to actually rob from
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:35.680]  me or not to give in charity they have big studies out of the university in
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:41.000]  Canada that it's libertarians and then conservatives are the biggest givers to
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.720]  charity and you want to take care of yourself you want to help your friends
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:48.960]  and family by building them up you want to teach them how to fish not give them
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:55.920]  fish and you have a feeling of connection and empathy and you want to
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.640]  build up humanity and you want to teach people what you've learned you want to
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:05.680]  empower people but these control freaks see other people empowered as a threat
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.160]  to them because they're so weak anybody who's a real leader who's truly strong
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:15.240]  wants to build up others because you're so confident that's right I like to be
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:23.840]  surrounded by other people that are successful and moral and rich I mean it
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.920]  makes my life better and richer and easier what I'm surrounded by people
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.640]  like that and just as you said it's the social paths of the world that want to
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:37.000]  bring everybody else down because artificially makes them higher and those
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.080]  are exactly the kind of people that are drawn to to the government today it's
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:45.440]  very disturbing absolutely teamed up with select corporations to create a
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:49.960]  global monopoly under their control with a planetary casual society powerful

[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:07.280]  bandidos and federales the villagers realized that until they were able to
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.600]  defend themselves they would always be slaves and victims so they hired
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.640]  professionals not to be their protectors but to teach them how to defend
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:21.160]  themselves it's a timeless tale of the power of the community of Posse Kamatadas
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.360]  our founders knew that permanent standing armies would mean a permanent

[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:35.920]  standing army in the world we have had a permanent state of war if our

[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:08.960]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:34.120]  network I want to open the phones up to talk about Bilderberg 2015 the shadow
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:42.680]  government rats in the middle of the Austrian Alps with 2000 federal police
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:47.640]  running around harassing the locals harassing reporters coming to our
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:51.960]  little lodge getting in our people's faces after they'd already interrogated
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:57.680]  them on the highway the reason this is so important is they wanted to keep it in
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:03.080]  secret we force it out in the open they want their agenda secret we're forcing
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:07.560]  those out in the open because then the EU the TPP all their agendas come to a
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.600]  screeching halt there's a reason they try to keep it secret when Hillary and
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.360]  Obama went there in 2008 and then she stepped down two days later there's a
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:21.320]  reason the Secret Service waived MP5 HK's that is for no reason trying to
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  intimidate us because they were told get those people out of here what happens
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:34.200]  if when Alex calls ABC NBC CBS and Fox and local newspapers if the press shows
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:41.600]  up we'll be caught secretly colluding we stuck the reporters
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:47.840]  150 of them on an airplane to go to Chicago in a pool saying that Obama was
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.400]  going there and slam the door and Shanghai them that's in my thumb oh the
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:55.840]  Obama deception we ought to cue that up I mean I get breathless I need to settle
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:01.840]  down to cover this because if we could have gotten the press to cover that it
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:07.480]  would have been a major game changer Hillary and Obama meeting in secret
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:12.400]  deciding who would step down Hillary's chief advisor is now going to be at
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.040]  Bilderberg this week Jeb Bush guaranteed is going to be there that's our intel he
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:21.880]  just so happens to be in Austria but says he won't attend at least Rick Perry
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:27.600]  admitted he attended Clinton lost his career going to Bilderberg Tony Blair
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:33.680]  countless others the word is Obama went in 2006 that's why they had a
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.840]  diplomatic car pull under an armored limousine and and disgorge him and
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:45.200]  Hillary the intel is that was his second visit there remember Tucker going where
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:49.920]  it is they've got that up-and-coming senator well Obama whatever his name is
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.480]  I'm even knew he was 2006 where it is he's in there too and he wasn't even
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.880]  important enough then to hardly even mention my making fun of Jim that's how
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:05.160]  he talked I smoke lucky struck total us he was a sweetheart he died about a year
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:10.600]  and a half ago it's weird people like that die you've known forever and they're
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:16.240]  just gone it's just it's just sick the Henry Kissinger just keeps on going like
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:22.680]  a evil wind-up ghoul some kind of vampiric
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:28.920]  Zombo an old war-covered white zombie
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:35.440]  Bilderberg confab discuss Iran solution Kurt Nemo's writing on that Bilderberg
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:39.480]  2015 police harass reporter search vehicle visit hotel we're gonna play that
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:45.640]  video coming up Bilderberg back Hillary first 2016 presidency I remember
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:50.880]  calling Fox calling CNN because that was a story there just to show they
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:54.120]  wouldn't report going hey I saw the Secret Service driving in a motorcade of
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:59.520]  10 black SUVs we've got sources inside it's Hillary Clinton and Obama the
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.680]  media for a day was saying where are they in Virginia they just disappeared
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:07.080]  had their cars at high speed you know running away from the media do you want
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:13.120]  to know and they'd say no click but I guess who did show up the Washington
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:20.360]  Times and the epoch times and then drudge linked to the epoch times no one
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.600]  people ask why is drudge so popular because you'll link to important stuff
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.240]  that's alternative media and end up being proven right just like we do the
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:32.040]  mainstream media is dying because people know they're a bunch of decepticons I
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:38.360]  was watching the CBS or NBC that Stephanopoulos host of the morning show
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.600]  on ABC I don't even know anymore yeah it's ABC that's right I was gonna be on a
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:48.320]  stupid show and then they didn't then they claim I didn't show up but I was on
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.680]  the elliptical this morning at the gym and they had TVs on I was watching them
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:56.040]  and the fakeness of the reporters the fakeness of the women and the way they
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:00.440]  were looking at the camera and just all of it was like predators like like wolves
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:06.680]  stalking prey I mean these people are so bad they're so fake they're not
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:13.960]  authentic I'm just an American a Texan a person that loves freedom really getting
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:26.040]  freaked out by the usurpation of my basic freedom here is George Stephanopoulos
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:29.960]  now I want to address some news you may have seen about me over the last several
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.640]  years I've made substantial donations to dozens of charities including the
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:37.360]  Clinton Global Foundation those donations were a matter of public record
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:40.540]  but I should have made additional disclosures on air when we covered the
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:44.080]  foundation and I now believe that directing personal donations that
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:48.080]  foundation was a mistake even though I made them strictly support work done to
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:51.360]  stop the spread of AIDS help children and protect the environment in poor
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:55.320]  countries I should have gone the extra mile to avoid even the appearance of a
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.400]  conflict I apologize to all of you for failing that is a sickening fake
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:05.360]  apology he made a few weeks ago and the reason I bring it up is the Clinton
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.400]  Foundation I've been covering it for about five years six years how long go
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:17.520]  did the whole earthquake in Haiti happen four or five years ago yeah yeah four
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.600]  years ago I've been covering it since then because I just noticed that half the
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:25.680]  money people gave for little black kids and the news was promoting everywhere was
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.680]  going to their private jets hotels and their institution and then I began to
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:34.400]  notice that all these politicians and pundits were giving money to it and then
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.480]  they would get jobs at it later paid 10,000 a month 20,000 a month you name
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:45.960]  it so what it is you give money tax-free and then it's like a mafia group and
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:49.920]  then if you need a job later it'll give you a job where you put your money in
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:58.720]  tax-free so it is pretty sick ladies and gentlemen and and these are not
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.880]  liberals these are fascist and I want to be clear there are real liberals that
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:08.680]  will that are loving that are caring that really want a quality who really
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.480]  don't want gays persecuted who really think it's a woman's right you know to
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.680]  have an abortion who are misguided and I'm not getting into the whole sexual
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.880]  persuasion thing I'm saying there are a lot of really good liberals that are
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:26.920]  good people just like there are a lot of good conservatives but when they get to
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:33.360]  following the leadership of their parties they are turned over to pure
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:43.440]  evil there's a headline right there the Clintons had the most wasteful US funded
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  Haiti projects well they're not designed to help anybody they're payoffs where you
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:53.560]  pay your buddy to build a shelter the shelter cost $10,000 and they get a
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:16:00.320]  hundred thou it's money laundering you put your money in the Clinton Foundation
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:04.640]  and then it gives money to your company to have some work done and pays you five
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:12.600]  times what it was worth to giant criminal mafia operation Hillary Clinton gets
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:18.760]  money from third-world dictators to her foundation when she was the head of the
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:23.800]  State Department and then within green light weapons transfers this is in the
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:32.400]  news last week by the billions of dollars to those countries and then it
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.440]  gets better see that's all Bilderberg is look at Prince Bernhardt this is how
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:42.520]  sick he is he wasn't as rich as his wife the actual queen of the Netherlands
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:46.600]  Queen Beatrix who just stepped down to make her son King two years ago and
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:53.960]  attends every Bilderberg I've shot video personally twice of her going in just to
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:17:02.800]  get a flavor of this and he had mistresses all over Europe I mean this
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:06.320]  was big Lockheed Martin scandals and payoffs to US defense contractors you
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:15.600]  name it but he was so greedy for money he founded the World Wildlife Fund and
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:19.680]  of course sued the Wrestling Federation take the name away he founded it to run
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:23.720]  clandestine operations all over Africa that later came out in the news but then
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.440]  would also run the poaching operations to make sometimes tens of millions of
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:38.360]  dollars a month to him using WWF as the front to do the hunting you can't make
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:46.720]  up how villainous these people are you look that up and he was diverting the
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:53.120]  tens of millions just to mistresses in Paris and other areas I mean the highest
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.680]  end once he just paid for his women because his wife wouldn't give him
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.600]  enough money he was he was he's related to Prince Charles he's good buddies we
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:07.160]  died with Prince Philip that's Prince Charles his dad the guy that says he
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.280]  wants to come back as a virus to kill 80% of the world population you look that
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:16.720]  up he told AP Autobahn Society that and a bunch he's quoted four times saying
[02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:23.760]  in magazines to the reporters to call humanity see the British royalty is
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:29.080]  German royalty because their bloodlines died out about 300 years ago and then
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:33.480]  those lines are actually Transylvania but the but the funny thing is see he was
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:38.040]  an SS officer when Hitler started losing they got the princelings out and
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:44.120]  had them flip sides over to the Dutch and it's just it's just it's it's
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:48.480]  hilarious really it's it's completely hilarious that when you give money the
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:54.840]  World War it's a poaching organization set up by an SS officer I mean you can't
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:01.800]  make that stuff up the Clintons knowingly for more than a decade fenced
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.080]  tainted blood out of Arkansas State prisons to be sold worldwide filled with
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:11.000]  hepatitis and HIV but it turned out Bayer wanted the blood and would mix it
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.280]  with good blood up in Canada to sell it worldwide as factor eight and it turned
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:18.760]  out it was an initiative just to kill people came out in French court they
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:23.280]  knew and said all these people need to die anyway see these are villains that
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:27.240]  showing off around boardrooms they go you got tainted blood to kill some people
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:34.480]  yeah we'll ship it out to you we're liberal did you hear we want to help

[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:39.320]  federal register that's where our edicts come from now saying you have to get
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:43.880]  with the federal government and the State Department on any discussion of
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:48.680]  guns period not just technical stuff and the NRA says this is the biggest
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:52.480]  attack on the First Amendment ever remember they banned Cody Wilson from
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.360]  putting up the design of a 3d printable gun online even internationally they
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:03.200]  claimed omnipresent total power continuing update more school districts
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.320]  report chaos after white privilege theory influences discipline rules and they
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:12.360]  go in and hype up racial division and racial fight start and there's problems
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:20.080]  just like 2020 to their credit in a report back in 1997 about how once they
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.960]  started death education in high schools around the country suicide tripled
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:29.200]  little girls never thought about suicide man with little girls but they would go
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.280]  and strangle themselves with their shoelaces just as they were taught not
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:37.000]  to do the dare program ended up making kids use drugs because it showed you how
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.200]  to use it told you about it where to get it what it was created the incentive
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:45.840]  it's like if my parents would tell me whatever you do don't get in this
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:49.080]  liquor cabinet and drink the whiskey first thing I do as soon as they left
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:54.160]  was gonna try to drink the whiskey when I was 11 of course my parents didn't do
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:57.440]  that but other kids that were told not to they would my parents to be like you
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:02.640]  want to try this then I wouldn't want any but my aunt gave me a plaque it says
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.080]  if you want your children to listen to you whisper quietly to someone else it's
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.040]  true you'll talk right to them sometimes they ignore you but if you talk to
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.000]  someone like whispering they suddenly listen to every word my kids are pretty
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:24.760]  good but the point is that we're not in Kansas anymore 800 25 at 992 31 and
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:32.480]  notice it just gets more and more insane by the minute I'm gonna be going over
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:38.640]  that article more it's really important oh look at this world leaders promise at
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:44.040]  G7 to phase out fossil fuels does anyone even believe that they mean phase it
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:51.640]  out when you try to use fossil fuels and tax you more billionaire owner sees
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.640]  wealth gap fueling social unrest and the globalist call for more taxes in the
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:01.560]  middle class the very thing that will actually destroy people being able to
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:06.640]  become wealthy or even upwardly mobile I mentioned this Bilderberg Bax Hillary
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:11.520]  for 2016 presidency chief Hillary advisor to attend secret confab the
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.280]  Bilderberg 2015 conference scheduled for talks taking place this weekend in
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:19.360]  Austria will focus at least in part on American elections according to a press
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:25.000]  release on the secret of cabal's very limited public website the media will
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.320]  come out and say we made that up even though Bilderberg admits it which we
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:32.960]  forced him to do the factoid appearing along with a list of attendees one of
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:40.240]  one of which is Jim Messina of the Messina group who just happens to be
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:44.960]  chief advisor to Hillary Clinton Messina also heads up the super PAC
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:48.960]  priorities USA which supported Obama and is now firmly in the Clinton camp
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:53.600]  Messina also spearheaded Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 012 and has just
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.000]  come back to the US after leading a deeply unpopular UK election minister
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.040]  David Cameron to a surprise majority victory in British elections that is an
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:06.320]  expert on making sure elections go the way they need them to and he's been
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:13.800]  meeting Hillary's Hillary's chief advisor I'm sure that's not newsworthy
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:22.080]  with 2000 federal troops guarding them nothing to see there and after all they
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:26.520]  have American flags behind them on MSNBC they must they must care about us
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.520]  they're also pushing open borders Bilderberg confab to discuss Iran
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:35.360]  solution you know read their agenda they admit that's just a cover agenda but
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:40.640]  it's still bad enough that's just some of the news we have on that front but
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:43.840]  people are voting with their dollars and that's why the globalists are so upset
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:49.720]  AP reports McDonald's sales slump continues in May sales at locations open
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:55.440]  at 13 months edge down another 0.3% last month that's a plunge in one month
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:02.440]  McDonald's sales slump so people just aren't buying the GMO garbage like they
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:07.200]  used to I guess there should just be a law to do something about that and try
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:12.000]  to stop it bad news on the Second Amendment front yeah this new Supreme
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.640]  Court's come out blackmailed and totally controlled they've got whatever is going
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:21.120]  on in those closets ready to launch should wonder if it's has to have such
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:24.720]  stuff Supreme Court rejects in our race challenge the San Francisco gun
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.720]  regulation regulation requires anyone who keeps a handgun at home must enter
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:34.120]  either store it in a locked container or disable it with a trigger lock they're
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:37.400]  saying yeah I got to make your gun useless they agree with that so a big
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:46.440]  strike against the Second Amendment when we come back your calls and HD video of

[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:22.320]  airstrikes talk about a major shift in narrative since the beginning of serious
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:26.320]  so-called civil war the Obama administration has funded an armed
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:31.080]  radical Islamists under the guise of supporting moderate rebels last February
[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:35.120]  the president even handed the Free Syrian Army the ability to order US
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:41.680]  airstrikes and one jihadist told Al Jazeera in 2013 FSA fighters regularly

[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:50.520]  that's when the US isn't accidentally dropping weapons right in ISIS

[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:23.480]  special report Rob do reporting for info wars.com right outside Telfz
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.080]  Australia we're up the mountain a little bit from this small little hamlet and
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:30.800]  you can look around and see the tranquility now but that is not what is
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:36.120]  going on it is a major police presence here we've seen at least 50 cops already
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:41.080]  today there's cops patrolling around me right now in this area we hit a road
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:44.640]  block right at the base of the mountain just outside the town
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:54.820]  here you go Texas yep they call paper the rental agreement I need to see your
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:39:01.360]  papers for the car yeah I'm guessing it means like that maybe that that what you
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:12.160]  need yeah is this the hotel no you know how far the buccan is the hotel open
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:18.640]  the what's it open the open the back oh okay
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:34.560]  oh there might be a thing down there arts one here English yeah I don't know
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:38.560]  how to it's a riddle it might just be a hidden lock and then there's probably
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:56.800]  a thing in just a lot no okay we were just pulled over and talked to the place
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:59.440]  that showed a little bit in there but then they told me to stop filming and I
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:05.960]  don't want to mess around here just as we arrived but yeah I don't think people
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:10.320]  were getting past here we happen to get one of the last rooms at the place we're
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:16.240]  staying at up the hill and we were not expecting a checkpoint so soon I mean we
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:22.320]  just pulled out at a telse and we saw the enter helping hotel had an info
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:27.880]  wars bumper sticker on it they wanted a passport driver's license I wanted to
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:34.200]  look in the car yeah open the back yeah they gave us the the full money but I
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:40.360]  don't think there's gonna be much getting past these these uh police here
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:46.000]  that was crazy yeah I'm not sure the Austrian demeanor but those people weren't
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:50.080]  messing around they seemed no pretty angry yeah they want to know who the
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:54.360]  hell we were you know we came up here a couple days early to shoot some b-roll
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:58.560]  get some R&R and before you know we're doing the intensity of Bilderberg as you
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:01.640]  know we've covered it for many years we've never seen a police presence like
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:07.040]  this at all it is totally unprecedented we can't even get near the hotel at
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.320]  this point the hotel is probably a mile and a half up up the mountain that way
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:14.840]  and there is no way we're gonna get anywhere near it I mean there's just
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.920]  roadblock after roadblock there's cops everywhere and I tell you I've never
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:23.720]  seen anything like it so we're gonna stay here as long as we can to give you
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:27.480]  the best coverage we can get and if for some reason we are kicked out of here
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:31.760]  we'll relocate from outside the perimeter area and we will continue to
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:36.280]  broadcast so stay tuned to infowars.com infowars.com forward slash show for the
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.760]  live feed we're gonna be on the show today talking with Alex about this
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:44.080]  because what I saw today completely freaked me out we had cops surrounding
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:48.040]  our car they had their hands on their guns they were ready for anything and
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:53.480]  we're just a couple of guys you know with suitcases totally unprecedented this
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:56.440]  is it this is what it's gonna be like in the New World Order it's gonna be police
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:59.960]  presence everywhere protecting the elites while you are treated like a slave
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:04.560]  and a surf and then they tax you and man even the car we're driving today has
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:09.160]  this has a sensor built in so when the light turns red the car turns off and
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:13.520]  then it turns back on when it's green I mean totally crazy that's the kind of
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:16.640]  world you're gonna live in if these control freaks get in charge so just
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:21.760]  remember that pray for us out here we're doing our best we're gonna bring you
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:26.200]  more updates hopefully you've seen the footage now and it's freaked you out but
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:29.560]  this has been Rob Dew reporting from just outside Telves, Austria for info
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:35.200]  wars.com and info wars nightly news oh you're at the checkpoint now we're going
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:42.640]  to take you and your family away just thank God we've got a second amendment
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:46.720]  oh but they open the borders up of Austria and let anybody in who wants to
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:53.120]  come in that's okay but if you're there to be a reporter and cover legitimate
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:59.960]  story your trash and I guarantee you they try to walk around on those public
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:06.600]  National Park trails down towards where the Bilderberg Hotel is that they will
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:11.080]  get arrested and I'm not gonna instruct them to do that I personally got on the
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.440]  barge in England and did go through the blockade but the police were smart and
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:21.560]  did not arrest me I wanted to bullhorn up closer they knew that it would have
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.000]  drawn more attention to the confab plus they I talked to a bunch of them did not
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.600]  like what was going on either if you don't have an instinct to not like
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:36.640]  elites meeting and sacred decide your future you deserve to be a slave and I
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:41.120]  just don't know why the Austrians and the Germans have to follow the stereotype
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:47.360]  the only turkey they acted like that a little bit not not quite as bad and it
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:52.160]  they didn't act as hateful the Turkish police though they were scared and
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:57.040]  aggressive and we're following our camera people around like in a movie and
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:00.640]  we'd be waiting outside their hotel room to follow us we have footage of all
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:10.900]  that but it's just mind-blowing it's it's these are the people setting up the
[02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:15.840]  TPP I've talked to reporters that are international reporters they can go to
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:18.600]  Russia which has not been friendly the press compared to a lot of other
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:22.520]  countries you can go to any of the big events get in with a press pass even if
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:27.360]  you disagree with them you can cover events now that turns out you work for
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:30.800]  a Western NGO or George Soros sometimes you get a bullet in the back of your
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:37.080]  head and that's how much this whole thing has escalated now but it's just
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:43.080]  crazy absolutely crazy that we've now gotten to this point of course the
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:46.280]  Russians claim that last reporter they got killed was killed in a false flag
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:50.520]  they said we're not gonna kill that reporter no one listens to your spy
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:54.760]  reporters you know nobody believes what they're saying why would we kill and
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.360]  make them a victim your people killed that reporter but I don't know I mean
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:03.480]  the Russians have been caught killing reporters before my point is this is what
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:17.040]  you see in Russia and it's dangerous it's out of control and it's shameful
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:21.320]  that the criminals can have taxpayer money pay for them to keep their event
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:25.200]  secret and that the mainstream media would go along with this well guess what
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:30.480]  the mainstream media because drudge report comm info wars comm are covering
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:35.160]  this I haven't seen the Guardian do it yet you guys Google Bilderberg I haven't
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:39.600]  done it since yesterday and click news I've been doing a clicking web all I saw
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:48.720]  was German Dutch French Spanish Austrian Portuguese Greek Irish news I
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:59.760]  didn't see any US or UK news on Bilderberg but the Guardian just did a
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:06.000]  story forget the G7 Bilderberg is where the big guns go and who wrote that
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.320]  Charlie Skelton oh yeah you're asking who to get on from Bilderberg Skelton's
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:15.960]  a perennial we need to get him on get Charlie Skelton once he gets out there
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.880]  on we're the first that we know of dad people there I wanted to get Watson
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:23.720]  there early but he had a family event planned for six months his brother's
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:27.400]  birthday and his family came back in taxes are too high for them to live in
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:34.600]  the UK his folks so they've evacuated but they come back and see him sometimes
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:40.720]  I'm making see their sons that both live in London separately that's a great
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.600]  pair of reporters and writers right there I've been with us now 13 years Watson
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:50.760]  Paul has Steve for about 10 years but I segue into your phone calls now Michael
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:56.640]  in Texas you're on the year free for all go ahead hey Alex I haven't seen you
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:00.760]  since the the Fed demonstration just before the Kennedy fiftieth anniversary
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:05.760]  that's right protesting the private fellow reserve yeah yeah I was there
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:09.760]  when McGreen pulled up in the getaway vehicle and met all you folks so it was
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:14.320]  it's good seeing you hey real quick I'm going to telecommunications business I
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:18.920]  work for Time Warner such a big company I'm not worried about getting outed here
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:24.560]  but it's so funny that the Comcast merger got canceled and the only other buyer
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:31.120]  for the company was charter and what a surprise that the premium that charter
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:34.800]  is going to pay for the stock is way higher than Comcast was gonna pay and
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:40.320]  you say wait a second economically if there's only one buyer for the stock
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:44.840]  for the company how does the price go up in other words if the government says
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:52.600]  no and and we have all these regulatory blockades to the Comcast merger going
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:56.560]  through well that only leaves one buyer left charter well then how does the price
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:02.240]  go up for the stock these people knew from the beginning that they were going
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:07.160]  to do this I don't I don't know what the the ultimate you know payout was going
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.520]  to be but I know that the chief executive Rob wait a minute you're telling me
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:18.320]  between regulators and major fortune 100 that there's a rigging no no they now
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.400]  admit for those that just tuned in just the last month stock market interest
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:28.000]  rates bonds everything's rigged totally for the elite it's all it's worse than a
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.760]  cheesy Atlantic City casino yeah and I wanted to talk about something that you
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:39.120]  bring up every once in a while being in the telecommunications industry since
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:44.600]  1990 I was around when a certain law got passed this was even before the
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:50.520]  telecommunications act in 96 came around this was called Kalia it's with it
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:55.480]  which means communications access for law enforcement act that was passed in
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:49:03.840]  1994 and what it provided was foreign companies who provide the box that
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:11.080]  enables American law enforcement to have access to do exactly what they're doing
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:15.160]  now this new thing reading all your email gave mainly an Israeli company
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:18.880]  total control of everything and the capacity to spy on everyone as well
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:23.040]  that's why the NSA is totally secret and no one at the NSA is allowed to look at
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:29.320]  who's on the fiber because it's actually a turnover of the US and and I'd be
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:32.960]  sitting there working with this these Israeli companies in the middle of the
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:38.800]  night and I'd say well wait a second you folks can be a long distance whatever
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:44.280]  the access they have you can listen to in other words you have access to this
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:49.080]  same box that our law enforcement does and we're supposed to believe knowing
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:53.600]  what the Mossad has done with all their false flags and all of their tricks down
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:57.840]  throughout the years we're gonna believe that these Israeli companies don't
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:02.360]  provide Mossad well say it's political correctness it's political correctness
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:06.040]  it's like the school could take the 11-year-old girls to a porn shop
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:10.620]  because it was progressive and it's the same thing your anti-Semitic if you
[02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:14.800]  don't want black boxes so foreign governments can spy on you hooked in I
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:20.320]  don't care who it is the UK Israel whatever it shows how sick it is and
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:25.880]  don't worry Israel only has about 80% of the boxes in place Chinese companies
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:31.160]  and others have been given access to that market and so is the UK so basically
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:35.520]  we've been designed to be wide open and taken down and I've had the former head
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:41.920]  of NSA technical in here agreeing that it's a design takedown you understand the
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:48.120]  CIA the FBI the NSA cannot look at who is on the NSA grid it's designed to bring
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:52.560]  us down and destroy us it is a takeover system and the people pushing it in
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:57.520]  Congress are foreign agents publicly sworn to destroy the Republic stay with
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:02.880]  us what's your health worth to you you probably can't place an exact value on
[02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:06.360]  it but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older
[02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:10.000]  yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:14.040]  false promises that's never been the way supernatural silver has chosen to do
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:18.240]  business long ago we set out to create a product that was light years beyond
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:22.080]  colloidal and ionic silver through extensive research and testing we
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:26.800]  succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective some
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:30.760]  might call us a premium product but we simply strive to be a product that
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:35.480]  worked supernatural silver is strong enough to fight off viruses bacteria and
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:39.600]  fungus but safe enough to be used internally or topically and it's
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:43.240]  powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:47.520]  better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers go to supernatural

[02:52:01.880 --> 02:52:05.560]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:10.040]  info wars dot com because the companies I've been approached by were not the
[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:13.840]  highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I
[02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:18.560]  refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then

[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:36.520]  woke me up a long time ago when I was living near you in Austin I moved back
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  home to Louisiana I'm sharing all I mean all the wonderful you know information
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:46.480]  and you you you you've given but I know we're short on time so I want to speak
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:51.360]  about the book of Enoch and the trumpets and and how the Trump is really connected
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:57.120]  to the jubilee and that's something that Jonathan Conn the rabbi Jonathan Conn
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:01.120]  talks about and I think people are no I know he's got a best-selling book out
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:04.680]  saying the blood moons I've only read synopsis and the trumpets are gonna
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:09.160]  start and now they're hearing these giant trumpets in North America towards the
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:13.280]  north and in the UK and it's even on T like huge trumpet sounds that are heard
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:17.960]  for a thousands of miles and it's pretty scary might be some atmospheric might
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:22.920]  be harp I mean it's just crazy but a lot of biblical stuff's happening what do
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:28.600]  you think it is well I you know I wrote an article called a strange trumpet like
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:34.720]  sounds harp turn angels or something else and harp I mean I think now I'm
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:39.000]  unclear but I'm on because I was told harp was being shut down due to lack of
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.640]  funding the Air Force was time 2013 but I know they've got harp centers all over
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:49.880]  the world but is it not true that DARPA took over DARPA now is that is that is
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.560]  that possible DARPA DARPA's always been over it's just the Air Force was in
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:57.800]  charge here's the headline Google exec behind ingestible ID chip to attend
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.760]  Bilderberg former DARPA director Regina Duggan to address artificial
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:05.040]  intelligence with global power brokers and you look at this woman man she

[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:52.920]  hey I'm 68 year old grandma in Phoenix and I've been listening to you since 2012 my first time calling I didn't have your email I'd like to get that
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:58.000]  but a week ago this past Saturday when we were doing my morning meal I came across a
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:03.840]  very disconcerting one from drugs.com I think a message is wanting me to
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:09.920]  participate in an amputee support group I became a bilateral amputee back in 1998
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:14.640]  as a result of an adverse effect from a migraine medication versus an accident of
[02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:17.720]  public pressure sure sure you're having a little trouble understanding because
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:22.920]  your phone connection but you're saying explain to me what you're saying I got it
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:28.280]  I got a message from the mail from drugs.com on my morning meal and enjoying
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:32.320]  me participating in amputee support group all right well come back I'm gonna go
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.640]  to you I'm gonna come back don't hang up I want to so you got people need to be
[02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:38.800]  part of a support group what they're probably really doing is tracking people
[02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:43.080]  that have been customers on it let me tell you folks big brother is moving
[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:47.000]  something wicked this way comes
[02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:52.120]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as
[02:58:52.120 --> 02:58:55.760]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[02:58:55.760 --> 02:59:00.880]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:05.640]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[02:59:05.640 --> 02:59:10.360]  30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we
