[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.689]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:17.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:21.062]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:45.003]  Well, I normally get up at about 6 a.m., but I don't normally roll out of bed with my reporters calling me from the Alps in Austria, where there are federal police, helicopters, you name it, six miles away from Bilderberg, 2015.
[00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.946]  It's unprecedented.
[00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:48.767]  They shut down.
[00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:56.087]  The hotel a week before it even begins.
[00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:58.529]  Unprecedented, normally it's a day before.
[00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:11.119]  And then now, two towns away, six miles away, over the mountains, there are checkpoints, classic, from the home of Hitler, Austria.
[00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:25.288]  Checkpoints, searching cars, and looking at everybody's IDs, and putting you in a database, and then when they got up two miles from it, they did it again, and then the police came to their hotel.
[00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:28.492]  And then I didn't hear from Rob Due or Josh Owens for hours.
[00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:42.872]  Paul Watson is staying in London until Wednesday, the day before it starts, so he can more judiciously focus on the reports coming in from our reporters on the ground, Rob Dew and Josh Owens.
[00:01:42.872 --> 00:01:47.195]  But Paul Watson is in constant contact, hourly with them.
[00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:56.162]  Getting the latest photos, getting the latest data as it comes in for articles to go on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:56.162 --> 00:02:00.226]  To watch those guys work like a team is just amazing.
[00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:10.515]  And to watch Rob and Josh Owens communicating to Kit Daniels and others the way, right when they hit the ground, they were all communicating with each other and getting the intel.
[00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:14.819]  And Paul Watson's gotten the membership list and the agenda.
[00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.240]  Their public agenda.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.942]  We've also got their private agenda.
[00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:23.570]  It's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.313]  DrugsReport.com is linked to our story.
[00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.956]  Bilderberg 2015 full attendee list and agenda.
[00:02:29.918 --> 00:02:33.260]  Elitist Confed to discuss artificial intelligence.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.241]  Yes, that's the big obsession.
[00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:40.443]  Google exec behind ingestible ID chips to attend Bilderberg 2015.
[00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:53.469]  Former DARPA director Regina Duggan to discuss artificial intelligence with global power brokers as they race to get the super AI in control, which I believe from evidence is already operating.
[00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:54.450]  It's known as Google.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.561]  That woman doesn't even look human.
[00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:13.266]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we will be joined by Rob Dew, InfoWars Nightly News Director, and Josh Owens, our cameraman and reporter, on the ground from the mountains of Austria.
[00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:22.169]  We're going to show you a Google map, speaking of AI, and a shot of where they are located coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:23.814 --> 00:03:26.377]  We have other incredible news.
[00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:29.040]  We reported on this Saturday.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.184]  Breitbart had it on Sunday.
[00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:35.026]  I could care less who has it first.
[00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:36.608]  Point is, we're just telling you about it.
[00:03:36.608 --> 00:03:41.233]  Obama to circumvent Congress with gag order on firearm coverage.
[00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:49.823]  The State Department is announcing even verbal communications about guns must be approved by them or you'll be indicted with felonies.
[00:03:49.823 --> 00:03:55.386]  No judge, no law, no ruling, no Congress, simply the State Department.
[00:03:55.386 --> 00:04:05.312]  The same ones that told Cody Wilson last year, Austinite InfoWars listener, who put out a design for a AR-15 printable gun.
[00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:07.834]  Not a gun, but the design for one.
[00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:11.176]  The State Department threatened to indict him.
[00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:17.335]  And he's been in court since then for daring to put the file out internationally.
[00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:20.778]  They claim global hegemonic control.
[00:04:20.778 --> 00:04:36.612]  Well, now that that wasn't opposed, they're claiming, and the NRA says the way it reads in the Federal Register, communicating about the Second Amendment, telling you about legislation, mentioning any type of information about reloading, just basically any communication, they're going to come after you outside of law.
[00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:42.991]  Supreme Court rejects NRA's challenge to San Francisco gun regulation.
[00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.454]  Really bad news on that front.
[00:04:45.454 --> 00:04:46.976]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:51.902]  Rand Paul demands White House release trade deal text immediately.
[00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:52.764]  Stay with us.
[00:04:52.764 --> 00:04:54.906]  Bilderberg 2015 breaking.
[00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:57.349]  Frontline coverage is three minutes away.
[00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:03.958]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.
[00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:11.280]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.363]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:20.343]  The bad news is

[00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:20.099]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.080]  The bad news is
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.108]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:33.913]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.

[00:08:09.335 --> 00:08:11.996]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:17.079]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:22.462]  Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head.
[00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:26.764]  Wrapped up in silence, lost circuits are dead.
[00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:31.126]  Energy cold, my whole life spins into a frenzy.
[00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:43.887]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this Monday the 8th day of June 2015.
[00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:48.329]  I am your host Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:09:06.931]  We have unprecedented news, unprecedented breaking information that affects basically everything on our globe that connects in to the TPP and other globalist treaties that circumvent sovereignty that are dictatorial.
[00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:17.955]  The Bilderberg Group, founded in the early 1950s in Oosterbeek, Holland, has been made up of British, Dutch royalty, European and U.S.
[00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:20.817]  robber barons, crony capitalists.
[00:09:20.817 --> 00:09:29.143]  Their own annals have been released to the BBC about eight years ago, admitting that they founded the European Union by stealth.
[00:09:30.578 --> 00:09:50.325]  Just as the TPP ties the Pacific region into the American Union through NAFTA and GATT and ties into the EU, this system was set up in secret and Bilderberg brags, members of Bilderberg have bragged since they've been exposed, that they created the European Union.
[00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:55.167]  The G7 is meeting as we speak in Europe.
[00:09:56.803 --> 00:10:06.645]  Then they will segue into the Bilderberg Group meeting in Austria, in the mountains.
[00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:13.167]  Now, in past Bilderberg Group events, they closed the hotel the day before.
[00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:17.728]  This time, they closed it over a week before.
[00:10:17.728 --> 00:10:22.109]  And my reporters, Rob Doob and Josh Owen, who we're about to talk to right now,
[00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:36.906]  Encountered roadblocks driving in from the airport, 40 miles away, in Telfs at the base of the mountain range, six miles from the hotel.
[00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:43.872]  They searched their vehicles, they pulled things out of the car, they searched other people's vehicles, they had the highway shut down.
[00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:46.474]  Two miles outside, more checkpoints.
[00:10:46.474 --> 00:10:52.279]  They had police at their Little Lodge Hotel, two miles away, searching people as well.
[00:10:54.795 --> 00:11:07.570]  So joining us from two miles from the Bilderberg Group meeting is our reporters Josh Owens and of course Rob Due, InfoWars Nightly News Director.
[00:11:10.953 --> 00:11:16.275]  This is unprecedented because 10 years ago mainstream media would say this didn't exist.
[00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:25.237]  But thanks to DrugsReport.com, the London Guardian gets credit as well, they began to link to our stories about a decade ago, forcing national debate.
[00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:29.378]  I've had the New York Times come out and say, this doesn't exist.
[00:11:29.378 --> 00:11:31.599]  Well, no, the TPP does exist.
[00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:34.160]  Obama ruling by executive action does exist.
[00:11:36.966 --> 00:11:42.889]  And now that we're forcing an international, national debate about this, this whole agenda is in trouble.
[00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:47.651]  Senator Paul is demanding Obama release the TPP right now.
[00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:50.412]  A lot of exciting things are going on.
[00:11:50.412 --> 00:11:59.996]  We're exposing the globalist shadow government that, I like it, is something like Spectre from James Bond movies or Hydra from Captain America.
[00:11:59.996 --> 00:12:00.797]  I mean, that's really
[00:12:02.551 --> 00:12:04.353]  Pull it up in mainstream Austrian news.
[00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:09.839]  Guess who the security is this year for Bilderberg?
[00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:12.502]  Cobra security.
[00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:13.023]  And guess what?
[00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:16.767]  They're based out of a castle nearby.
[00:12:16.767 --> 00:12:23.335]  So their security, wears black uniforms, calls themselves Cobra, and comes out of a Germanic castle.
[00:12:25.492 --> 00:12:28.594]  This is where reality is stranger than fiction.
[00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:32.116]  We'll put up that article on screen later if you're a viewer or a listener.
[00:12:32.116 --> 00:12:34.638]  I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.
[00:12:34.638 --> 00:12:47.066]  Joining us now from the tiny hamlet up the mountain from Telth, to give us the details, is Rob Due, and to talk about what he's gone through, Rob Due of InfoWars.com.
[00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:49.997]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:52.458]  Rob Dew reporting live from Telz, Austria.
[00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:54.859]  We actually had to come back down into Telz to get a better signal.
[00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:57.240]  Our cell phone signal was not too good up there on the mountain.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.081]  But let me tell you, what I've seen today is so far blown out of proportion, the security on here.
[00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:07.943]  You just go right up the road here, around the curve, right outside of Telz, and you hit a giant roadblock.
[00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:09.644]  They're diverting cars off to the side.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.680]  They stopped us.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.161]  They didn't like Josh's Texas driver's license.
[00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:15.402]  So they said pull over.
[00:13:15.402 --> 00:13:16.162]  So we pulled over.
[00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.923]  Then they wanted to see the papers of the car.
[00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:19.984]  Then they wanted to know what we were doing.
[00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:21.645]  We showed them the booking check-in.
[00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:22.325]  That wasn't good enough.
[00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:23.565]  They wanted to see our passports.
[00:13:23.565 --> 00:13:24.926]  Then they said open up the trunk.
[00:13:24.926 --> 00:13:26.526]  They wanted to see what was in our bags.
[00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:28.887]  Blows my mind.
[00:13:28.887 --> 00:13:30.868]  Rob, you're having a little bit of an audio problem.
[00:13:30.868 --> 00:13:31.788]  You're overdriven.
[00:13:31.788 --> 00:13:36.609]  If you can turn down your audio at source, or back that mic away about a foot, that'd be good.
[00:13:36.609 --> 00:13:44.431]  Rob Due, Rob Due of Infowars.com, joining us from the foot of the mountain where the Bilderberg Group meeting is set to be.
[00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:48.992]  He's about six miles out, where they set up checkpoints six miles out.
[00:13:48.992 --> 00:13:51.753]  Truly unprecedented, Rob Due.
[00:13:51.753 --> 00:13:55.514]  That's right, and right up that hill behind me is where the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:13:55.514 --> 00:13:56.134]  Up that mountain,
[00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:02.980]  You can't really for up and let me tell you it gets really weird when you get up there.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.503]  There's police bands everywhere and these aren't like the local police.
[00:14:05.503 --> 00:14:08.345]  The local police here wear khakis and they kind of look like Boy Scouts.
[00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:10.748]  That's a bell going off of a church right next to me.
[00:14:10.748 --> 00:14:13.270]  If you want to pan up there and see that we're right next to this giant church.
[00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.292]  We decided to come down here and shoot.
[00:14:16.047 --> 00:14:20.450]  But let me tell you, Alex, the amount of police presence here is ridiculous.
[00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.391]  They were at our hotel when we arrived.
[00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:24.192]  We were the only two people at this hotel.
[00:14:24.192 --> 00:14:25.332]  The owners weren't even there.
[00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:27.513]  They left the key under the doormat for us.
[00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:28.214]  Okay?
[00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:29.795]  And so we see a police van.
[00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:30.235]  They come out.
[00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:31.956]  They start questioning us.
[00:14:31.956 --> 00:14:33.857]  We're trying to call the owners to check in.
[00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:35.118]  We couldn't even check into the hotel.
[00:14:35.118 --> 00:14:36.679]  We had cops surrounding us.
[00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:40.981]  We put a video up on InfoWars on the YouTube channel, the Alex Jones channel.
[00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:41.922]  You should be able to see it now.
[00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:42.622]  It should be uploaded.
[00:14:43.374 --> 00:14:45.655]  Um, we're dealing with low bandwidth out here.
[00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:46.835]  We're in the middle of nowhere.
[00:14:46.835 --> 00:14:59.497]  This is the middle of the Austrian Alps, which is, I think, why the Bilderbergers chose this place, because it's secret, it's very secluded, there's nothing surrounding that hotel but forest and a golf course, and there's nothing else around it.
[00:14:59.497 --> 00:15:04.519]  Even the paths, the hiking paths, we saw police walking the hiking paths.
[00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:06.579]  They're going on foot patrols.
[00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:08.359]  They are serious about this.
[00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:11.200]  And let me tell you, after I talked to you Alex, you said they're going to come back and talk to you.
[00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:12.679]  Guess what?
[00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.901]  They showed up at our door.
[00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:16.923]  About eight of them show up, and then more show up.
[00:15:16.923 --> 00:15:18.124]  They just come marching down the hill.
[00:15:18.124 --> 00:15:19.065]  They want to see our passports.
[00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:21.367]  They want to start checking us over.
[00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:24.710]  Rob Dew, InfoWars.com, Nightly News Director.
[00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.253]  I want you to start over from the beginning, flying into Austria, driving in.
[00:15:28.253 --> 00:15:35.219]  A to Z, tell us about what's happened in your last eight hours there on the ground where it's about to be evening.
[00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:35.860]  Okay.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.701]  Yeah, it's about 6 o'clock, 6.30 right now.
[00:15:39.151 --> 00:15:44.213]  We flew in, we first made a stop in O'Hare, and I decided to shoot a report, ask some people about Bilderberg.
[00:15:44.213 --> 00:15:45.314]  Nobody really knew about it.
[00:15:45.314 --> 00:15:46.294]  Nobody knew anything about it.
[00:15:46.294 --> 00:15:48.175]  They thought it was a group, and that's what I find.
[00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:50.616]  Most people just don't know what it is.
[00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:57.299]  I was at a party with some buddies of mine, told them I'm going to the Bilderberg conference in Austria, and they go, Bilderberg?
[00:15:57.299 --> 00:15:58.199]  Bilderberg?
[00:15:58.199 --> 00:15:59.400]  No, it's not Bilderberg, people.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.740]  It's the Bilderberg group.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.162]  It's some of the most influential people in Western culture, Europe,
[00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:15.127]  Canada, United States, they all get together and they all conspire in secret and they say it's a private meeting, so they don't want you there, but they make you pay for all the police presence.
[00:16:15.127 --> 00:16:24.795]  There's 2,000 cops crawling over this mountain right now that the people of Austria are going to be paying for out of their tax dollars when they don't have taxes for roads.
[00:16:24.795 --> 00:16:26.276]  That's right, Rob.
[00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:28.878]  Describe once you got to Austria, break down what happened to you today.
[00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:32.711]  So we pull into Telfs.
[00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:33.452]  We finally got here.
[00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.714]  It took a long time.
[00:16:34.714 --> 00:16:38.399]  Long, long flight across the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:39.521]  We pull into Telfs.
[00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:40.482]  Everything looks fine.
[00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:42.525]  We round the corner outside of Telfs.
[00:16:43.783 --> 00:16:46.724]  And boom, giant security checkpoint.
[00:16:46.724 --> 00:16:48.984]  They're diverting the traffic off to the right.
[00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:49.805]  They're stopping people.
[00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:52.085]  They have a canopy built over this area.
[00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:53.826]  I mean, it wasn't something that they just built.
[00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:55.866]  This wasn't just a couple of cones.
[00:16:55.866 --> 00:16:58.407]  No, it is a giant roadblock, and this is the future.
[00:16:58.407 --> 00:17:05.249]  This is the future if people don't wake up and start demanding answers and demanding accountability from people who are part of the Bilderberg operation.
[00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:06.669]  So we got pulled over.
[00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:09.204]  And they asked to see Josh's license.
[00:17:09.204 --> 00:17:10.826]  He shows them his Texas driver's license.
[00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:12.348]  He goes, Texas, eh?
[00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:14.030]  And then he wants to see our passports.
[00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:21.639]  And then we show them the... They don't like that we're going up that area, so we show them the booking papers and say, hey, we're staying at a hotel right up the hill.
[00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:22.340]  And they didn't like that.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.843]  They wanted to see my passport because my name's attached to the booking.
[00:17:25.453 --> 00:17:26.534]  And then they go, well, get out.
[00:17:26.534 --> 00:17:27.194]  Let's see.
[00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:27.834]  Let's see the car.
[00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:30.355]  So then at that point, I pulled the camera out and start filming.
[00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:34.117]  And then I guess he was a higher ranking official there.
[00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:35.898]  He had a different color shirt on, different hat.
[00:17:35.898 --> 00:17:37.499]  He says, no, no, no, don't do that.
[00:17:38.334 --> 00:17:46.956]  So he tapped me on the shoulder, so I put the camera down, because I don't know how these guys act here, especially the police that are patrolling right now are a lot different than the local police here.
[00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:48.816]  The local police here kind of look like Boy Scouts.
[00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:50.716]  They have khakis with green.
[00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:52.557]  These guys are wearing blue military fatigue.
[00:17:52.557 --> 00:17:57.458]  Yeah, they're federal police, and we're showing amazing footage of when they came to your hotel after.
[00:17:57.458 --> 00:17:58.678]  So go through all this.
[00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:03.139]  First, you go through a checkpoint, they pull you over, they're searching, continue.
[00:18:04.713 --> 00:18:06.093]  Right, so we got through that.
[00:18:06.093 --> 00:18:07.054]  We go up the hill.
[00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:08.674]  We pass two or three other cars.
[00:18:08.674 --> 00:18:13.055]  We see more of them on the trails, just standing around, just setting up perimeters.
[00:18:13.055 --> 00:18:14.636]  Then we get to where our hotel is.
[00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:17.757]  As we pull in, nobody's there except another police van.
[00:18:17.757 --> 00:18:21.258]  There's another police van, and we see guys walking down the trail.
[00:18:21.258 --> 00:18:23.398]  They've been on a foot patrol.
[00:18:23.398 --> 00:18:27.739]  So we're trying to unload our stuff, figure out where we're going to put our stuff, find our room.
[00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:28.780]  We finally get into our room.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.800]  We start unloading stuff.
[00:18:30.604 --> 00:18:32.945]  And during this time, Josh had talked to a couple of guys.
[00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.406]  We were trying to call the owners to get the key.
[00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.386]  And you can see that footage.
[00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:38.407]  It's there in the video.
[00:18:38.407 --> 00:18:40.507]  They're surrounding him, questioning, what are you doing here?
[00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:41.108]  Who are you?
[00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:43.028]  Da-da-da-da-da.
[00:18:43.028 --> 00:18:52.451]  And let's remember, you're about two miles then from even the property line of the big resort where the Bilderberg Group is going to be meeting in five days or four days now.
[00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:53.972]  I mean, simply incredible.
[00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.381]  Yeah, they're not going to be there until Thursday, Alex.
[00:18:57.381 --> 00:18:58.363]  Today is Monday.
[00:18:58.363 --> 00:18:59.905]  It's Monday morning.
[00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.668]  But they had the trails closed off last week.
[00:19:01.668 --> 00:19:06.916]  They've had these federal police out here for almost a week now.
[00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:07.797]  And it's ridiculous.
[00:19:07.797 --> 00:19:08.919]  This is taxpayer money.
[00:19:09.642 --> 00:19:12.063]  Well, remember, supposedly this group didn't exist.
[00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:16.406]  Then when it did exist, there's no governmental decisions being made, but their own annals have been leaked.
[00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.546]  They are making decisions.
[00:19:17.546 --> 00:19:19.967]  This is just a continuation of the G7.
[00:19:19.967 --> 00:19:24.570]  We've got Jeb Bush in Europe right now, reportedly deciding whether he's going to run or not.
[00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.431]  This is where Bill Clinton went in 1991 and came from nowhere.
[00:19:27.431 --> 00:19:32.594]  It's where Tony Blair went in 1994 before becoming Prime Minister.
[00:19:32.594 --> 00:19:33.975]  These are the major kingmakers.
[00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.736]  When we come back, Rob Dub.
[00:19:36.698 --> 00:19:47.405]  ...is reporting from Austria, six miles from Bilderberg, with checkpoints all the way up over the mountain to the other side, where the Bilderberg group is set to be meeting.
[00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:57.212]  And for a week, Austrian papers have reported the federal presence there, crawling all over the hills, looking to stop any reporters that dare try to go to this meeting that isn't important.
[00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:05.436]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[00:20:58.706 --> 00:21:03.871]  Alex Jones here with InfoWarsLive.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:09.155]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient.
[00:21:09.295 --> 00:21:11.176]  in clean forms of iodine.
[00:21:11.176 --> 00:21:19.259]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:28.262]  The bad news is, for the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of survival shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[00:21:28.262 --> 00:21:33.064]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[00:21:33.064 --> 00:21:33.964]  That exclusive
[00:21:35.265 --> 00:21:43.551]  999 Pure Source is proprietary and only available at Infowarslife.com and that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:50.557]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and long-time supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:21:50.557 --> 00:21:54.540]  Available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:21:58.462 --> 00:22:00.244]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:22:00.244 --> 00:22:02.106]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:22:02.106 --> 00:22:03.607]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:22:03.607 --> 00:22:05.129]  Mine has fallen apart.
[00:22:05.129 --> 00:22:11.315]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:14.538]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:15.079]  What is that?
[00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:24.907]  Well apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:22:24.907 --> 00:22:33.635]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:34.255]  Wow!
[00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:35.576]  That sounds scary.
[00:22:35.576 --> 00:22:40.020]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.841]  Are they more expensive?
[00:22:41.281 --> 00:22:41.802]  No.
[00:22:41.802 --> 00:22:49.489]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:22:49.489 --> 00:22:50.670]  Sounds great!
[00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.292]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:57.376]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:22:57.856 --> 00:22:58.816]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:00.657]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:00.657 --> 00:23:02.418]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:55.752 --> 00:23:56.613]  Come and take it!
[00:24:09.795 --> 00:24:12.878]  Alright, we're off to InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:24:12.878 --> 00:24:17.122]  Chief of Staff is up there with Josh Owen of InfoWars.
[00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:20.265]  They're in Telfz, six miles away to get internet.
[00:24:35.885 --> 00:24:44.632]  There is another little town that they're staying in that's up on the top and you go over the mountain and Bilderberg's two miles away, the hotel there.
[00:24:44.632 --> 00:24:55.940]  Tell us again the name of the little town up on the top of the hill where you're staying and then describe the hotel where Bilderberg, huge luxury complex, golf course, you name it, out in the middle.
[00:24:56.821 --> 00:25:01.466]  of the Austrian Alps, and this is truly unprecedented.
[00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:06.431]  Not even G20 sets up checkpoints six miles away, not even G7.
[00:25:06.431 --> 00:25:10.776]  And of course we see G7 meeting right before Bilderberg.
[00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:14.160]  You'll have the very people that are at the G7 at this event.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.022]  When I was in England two years ago, of course, the Prime Minister was there and they said, oh, he won't be there.
[00:25:19.022 --> 00:25:22.503]  And then, of course, he did show up and became a national news story.
[00:25:22.503 --> 00:25:29.486]  They do not want to be revealed because then their agenda of TPP and the rest of it starts getting exposed, just like
[00:25:30.492 --> 00:25:40.178]  The exposure of Bilderberg is now forcing the UK to go for a vote in a referendum, which they never had on being under the EU.
[00:25:40.178 --> 00:25:45.781]  Imagine being absorbed by another grouping of countries and you never had a vote.
[00:25:45.781 --> 00:25:51.284]  So, Rob Dew, joining us again from Telfs, Austria.
[00:25:51.284 --> 00:25:54.886]  Describe the topography, describe the local geography, and give us a 360 pan.
[00:25:56.837 --> 00:25:58.238]  Sure, I'll do that.
[00:25:58.238 --> 00:26:02.402]  The place where we're staying is called Bukin, and it's a little hamlet.
[00:26:02.402 --> 00:26:09.067]  Probably where we're at is actually two lodges and a little small apartment, and then across the street there's a couple other buildings, but that's about it.
[00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:16.694]  It also has a bus station there, and then you go a little bit further down the road and you hit the Hotel Interalpen, and that looks like a giant pyramid.
[00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.151]  Go figure.
[00:26:18.151 --> 00:26:22.335]  That's where the elites would want to meet in something that looks like a giant three-sided pyramid.
[00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:25.198]  And there's a golf course up there, and then there's nothing much else up there.
[00:26:25.198 --> 00:26:26.399]  But let me give you a quick pan.
[00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:28.361]  We're staying up the hill.
[00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:29.061]  Up the hill.
[00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:30.102]  It's up the mountain.
[00:26:30.102 --> 00:26:31.804]  But let me show you over here, Alex.
[00:26:31.804 --> 00:26:32.205]  Look at this.
[00:26:32.885 --> 00:26:41.650]  I mean, nothing but beautiful tranquility, mountains, you hear birds chirping, there's a car going by every once in a while, but really peaceful.
[00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.151]  And that peace is being totally decimated now by these federal cops.
[00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:46.132]  Well, you know why?
[00:26:46.132 --> 00:26:49.854]  Because Smog moved into the mountain.
[00:26:49.854 --> 00:26:50.794]  That's right.
[00:26:50.794 --> 00:26:53.416]  He liked the gold that was contained within the mountain.
[00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:59.179]  And he doesn't like you being there, so his orcs are running around looking for any press.
[00:27:00.404 --> 00:27:02.848]  That is a perfect metaphor for what is going on.
[00:27:02.848 --> 00:27:03.950]  Because they are orcs.
[00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.956]  They gave Josh the stink eye.
[00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:07.897]  Really bad at the end.
[00:27:07.897 --> 00:27:10.161]  They go, we will tell you where you can go.
[00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.925]  You can go here, you can't go there.
[00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:16.277]  You can't go down there, you can't go over there.
[00:27:16.277 --> 00:27:17.938]  It was really ugh, ugh, ugh.
[00:27:17.938 --> 00:27:19.178]  It was very orcish.
[00:27:19.178 --> 00:27:20.879]  It was very orcish.
[00:27:20.879 --> 00:27:24.660]  Finish up with the federal police that are there.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.521]  That's in and of itself an Austrian, that's what they are, I looked them up.
[00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:33.363]  Federal police are there in their tactical outfits, running around harassing reporters.
[00:27:33.363 --> 00:27:38.025]  Describe the whole catalogue of what happened to you, then we're going to go to break, come back with Josh Owen and get his take.
[00:27:39.073 --> 00:27:45.396]  Well, so we were putting together footage of the interaction at the checkpoint, and then the first interaction at the hotel.
[00:27:45.396 --> 00:27:47.717]  And then all of a sudden, Josh goes, they're coming down.
[00:27:47.717 --> 00:27:49.558]  And Josh, how many were coming down at that point?
[00:27:49.558 --> 00:27:51.199]  I was editing, so I wasn't looking.
[00:27:51.199 --> 00:27:57.022]  About eight, coming down this beautiful prairie, like something like a bizarro little house on the prairie.
[00:27:57.022 --> 00:28:00.484]  These giant federal troops coming down, just looking like that.
[00:28:00.484 --> 00:28:02.625]  And then they go, we want to see your passport.
[00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:03.505]  Passport, passport.
[00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:05.907]  So they're getting in our face, want our passports, we give them our passports.
[00:28:05.907 --> 00:28:07.487]  They go, who else is staying with you?
[00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:08.728]  This place can house four people.
[00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:11.890]  We have one other person on the reservation.
[00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.171]  The owners told us to put everybody on that we thought would come up.
[00:28:14.171 --> 00:28:18.773]  So we also have PJW, Paul Joseph Watson, on the reservation as well.
[00:28:18.773 --> 00:28:19.694]  So he could get up the hill.
[00:28:19.694 --> 00:28:23.876]  Because let me tell you, if you're not on that booking, they're not letting you pass the checkpoint.
[00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:24.816]  So then they took that.
[00:28:24.816 --> 00:28:26.017]  I showed them my press pass.
[00:28:26.017 --> 00:28:28.058]  I said, here, I'm press, you know.
[00:28:28.058 --> 00:28:30.519]  We're here a couple days.
[00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:34.021]  This thing doesn't start till Thursday.
[00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:39.138]  We're having a Skype break up.
[00:28:39.138 --> 00:28:43.001]  Let's fade him out for a moment.
[00:28:43.001 --> 00:28:44.142]  Tell him to start back over.
[00:28:44.142 --> 00:28:45.623]  He started cutting out.
[00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:50.748]  Dude, you were at the part about surrounded by cops and you were telling them
[00:28:52.277 --> 00:28:56.260]  I pulled out my press pass.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.341]  I said I'm with Free Speech Systems, Infowars.com.
[00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:01.002]  They're starting to write all this down.
[00:29:01.002 --> 00:29:02.483]  They're really looking intent.
[00:29:02.483 --> 00:29:04.425]  They're like, you said you were on a trip.
[00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:08.347]  I said, well, we had a couple days to kill and the real event isn't starting until Thursday.
[00:29:09.088 --> 00:29:11.229]  So, yeah, we are on a trip right now.
[00:29:11.229 --> 00:29:15.452]  We're shooting beautiful video of this beautiful countryside, a very beautiful country.
[00:29:15.452 --> 00:29:17.393]  The flight in was amazing.
[00:29:17.393 --> 00:29:18.814]  We were flying next to mountains.
[00:29:18.814 --> 00:29:21.035]  We have footage of that that we'll put up later tonight.
[00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:21.795]  Just getting here.
[00:29:21.795 --> 00:29:23.836]  We're going to have a whole montage.
[00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:25.237]  And we thought we'd have time to do that today.
[00:29:25.237 --> 00:29:29.260]  Finish up with the cops when we come back, and then I'll give you a moment to switch Josh in front of the camera.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:39.845]  Juxtapose this to England, certainly not free compared to the way it used to be, where we had like 3,000 demonstrators outside, not one arrest, not one problem with the cops.
[00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:45.489]  The cops come into our hotel having dinner with us, 3,000 people showing up, no problems.
[00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:48.290]  You go to Austria and, you know, the stereotype reigns true.
[00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.092]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.092 --> 00:29:54.774]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:06.393]  Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but back in my day, a school field trip consisted of a sack lunch and a trip to the zoo.
[00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:12.837]  But now they've upped the ante in places like Minneapolis, where a private school is taking their kids to a sex shop.
[00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:13.718]  That's right.
[00:30:13.718 --> 00:30:22.304]  Multiple news outlets are reporting that parents are demanding school chiefs' removal after she took a group to the Smitten Kitten for sex education class.
[00:30:22.304 --> 00:30:27.848]  And as you might imagine, a place like the Smitten Kitten has several objects that you won't find in gym class.
[00:30:28.488 --> 00:30:32.790]  And while the school has not been available for direct comment, they did issue a statement.
[00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:37.852]  Some parents, like Steven Straumat, are mad as hell and have already removed their children from the school.
[00:30:37.852 --> 00:30:40.313]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:30:58.928 --> 00:31:15.594]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:31:15.594 --> 00:31:19.095]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:31:19.435 --> 00:31:23.337]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:31:23.337 --> 00:31:25.037]  hdfirearms.com.

[00:33:06.165 --> 00:33:10.546]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:10.546 --> 00:33:18.049]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:20.310]  We see the earth.
[00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.011]  We've got it.
[00:33:23.011 --> 00:33:25.792]  We see the earth.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.123]  Talk about an ad for Super Mel Vitality and Survival Shield X2.
[00:33:38.123 --> 00:33:40.004]  You're watching us on TV.
[00:33:40.004 --> 00:33:59.298]  If you search engine Alex Jones Bilderberg 2013 or Alex Jones Watford England or thousands protest Bilderberg England you will see over 3,000 people covering a grassy knoll over the Bilderberg Group Hotel where they were meeting about a half mile away.
[00:34:01.471 --> 00:34:09.636]  3,000 plus people peacefully demonstrating against global shadow government and then the Prime Minister arrives.
[00:34:09.636 --> 00:34:13.579]  They try to sneak him in secretly but it becomes national news.
[00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:28.908]  But talk about super male vitality, if you're a radio listener, the photo of me at the 2013 Bilderberg event giving the speech, I've lost, I'd already lost about 15 pounds there, I've lost another 40 plus pounds since then.
[00:34:29.741 --> 00:34:34.105]  I mean, look at the belly on that creature.
[00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:37.088]  And that is what... I was doing more exercise then.
[00:34:37.088 --> 00:34:42.473]  Let me just do a plug right now and I'll go back to my reporters.
[00:34:42.473 --> 00:34:47.417]  I got up to 279 pounds, or I've gained 99 pounds from 180 pounds of my fighting weight.
[00:34:52.622 --> 00:34:55.283]  And I've lost 60-plus pounds since then.
[00:34:55.283 --> 00:35:00.606]  I mean, when I got my shirt off and stuff, I've taken the photos and shown people, it's at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:00.606 --> 00:35:02.267]  I almost have a six-pack now.
[00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:05.289]  On the sides of my stomach, muscles.
[00:35:05.289 --> 00:35:06.990]  I have bumps now, muscles.
[00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.691]  I lose like seven, eight more pounds, I'm gonna have a six-pack.
[00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:14.113]  I've got a long torso, so bending over, there's still a small belly there.
[00:35:14.113 --> 00:35:16.895]  But I've gone from being obese
[00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:25.580]  I've gone from being in perfect shape to being obese to now getting back towards it, doing less exercise than I was three years ago.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:35.106]  I was swimming a mile almost every day, trying to jog, lifting weights, and it just wasn't doing it because I didn't have the iodine in my body I needed.
[00:35:35.106 --> 00:35:46.134]  And the photos we have on screen right there was just what I lost in 45 days, taking Supramel Vitality and X2 religiously and not forgetting to do it.
[00:35:47.634 --> 00:35:52.637]  And look, I don't claim I'm some Beach Boy model.
[00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:54.838]  The point is, it's a dramatic effect.
[00:35:54.838 --> 00:35:58.660]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.822]  I wasn't even tending to plugs, Survival Shield, Nacinide, Ion-X2, and Super Mel Vitality, the two key products.
[00:36:03.822 --> 00:36:04.903]  Oxy Powder helped as well.
[00:36:04.903 --> 00:36:07.084]  It helped me do it.
[00:36:07.084 --> 00:36:10.326]  But then, we were looking at photos to illustrate that
[00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:15.324]  Bilderberg a couple years ago, you know, 3,000 plus people show up.
[00:36:15.324 --> 00:36:16.445]  Everything's peaceful.
[00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:17.425]  We expose it.
[00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.407]  Newspapers all over the world report on it.
[00:36:19.407 --> 00:36:21.769]  People say, why are the elite meeting in secret?
[00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:23.770]  It does violate British laws.
[00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:24.771]  It violates U.S.
[00:36:24.771 --> 00:36:26.332]  laws.
[00:36:26.332 --> 00:36:36.660]  And so now they just meet in Austria, famous for being a police state, just like Germany is, where they ban, you know, demonstrations against radical Islam.
[00:36:37.841 --> 00:36:39.962]  Well, they can ban anything if you can do that.
[00:36:39.962 --> 00:36:58.771]  And then now I've got my friendly, mild-mannered reporters that are simply there at Bilderberg, 2015, and all they're trying to do is report on what's happening.
[00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:03.513]  And the way the cops are acting, unless they get word and pressure to stop,
[00:37:04.878 --> 00:37:10.401]  They're going to probably end up setting the guys up, giving them tickets, arresting them, throwing them out of the area, something.
[00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:13.763]  Which will cause an even bigger incident for Bilderberg.
[00:37:13.763 --> 00:37:15.845]  I mean, Bilderberg is smart.
[00:37:15.845 --> 00:37:17.125]  My guys are well behaved.
[00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:19.207]  So was I. No problem in England.
[00:37:19.207 --> 00:37:20.387]  Told the cops I was coming there.
[00:37:20.387 --> 00:37:22.489]  Told them I wasn't going to stir up any trouble.
[00:37:22.489 --> 00:37:24.490]  I was going to try to cover a legitimate event.
[00:37:25.418 --> 00:37:29.159]  It's legitimate to want to cover 150 world leaders meeting in secret?
[00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:35.740]  And I said, if you want to be stupid and arrest me or set me up, as Canada did, and make it a big story, you go ahead and do it.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:41.222]  I said, if you want to be legitimate and act like a free country, I'll buy you dinner.
[00:37:41.222 --> 00:37:45.283]  The cops wouldn't let me buy them dinner, but they did, you know, have a Coca-Cola with us.
[00:37:45.283 --> 00:37:48.804]  But a lot of the cops told us off record, no, we totally agree with you, no, this is criminal.
[00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:49.784]  They're here to loot our country.
[00:37:50.672 --> 00:37:52.774]  Same thing happened in Switzerland.
[00:37:52.774 --> 00:37:54.355]  Same thing happened in the U.S.
[00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:56.637]  The cops were on our side, most of them.
[00:37:56.637 --> 00:37:59.039]  Because why wouldn't you be on free speech's side?
[00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:00.560]  Reporters aren't illegal.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.362]  Cameras aren't illegal.
[00:38:03.362 --> 00:38:06.825]  But no, in Austria, they are acting like famous thugs.
[00:38:06.825 --> 00:38:11.128]  And this is what Estalin predicted when he was on a few weeks ago, I guess a month ago with us.
[00:38:11.128 --> 00:38:15.171]  He said, Austria is a serious police state.
[00:38:15.171 --> 00:38:18.474]  They like to cover it up, but look out when your people are there.
[00:38:20.868 --> 00:38:22.910]  I want to show some of the Watford newspapers.
[00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:36.420]  It was all over British newspapers, but I think if you type in Bilderberg 2013, Watford, or Alex Jones Talks to Press, Bilderberg 2013, you'll get amazing press photos off the cover of newspapers.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.883]  The shots we're looking for, I'm talking to my crew, are shots of newspapers.
[00:38:39.883 --> 00:38:40.624]  We took them.
[00:38:40.624 --> 00:38:41.545]  They're on Infowars.com.
[00:38:43.042 --> 00:39:12.003]  uh... and uh... I want to show that in articles the difference, I want to do a story, the difference from England the difference from the US with the police versus Austria where they've got people shut down six miles out off major roads that go over the Alps and aren't letting people travel down those roads unless you are staying at one of the lodges nearby and then they come to your lodge and get in your face there this is just unprecedented but finally
[00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:18.690]  We did sell out of almost all Survival Shield Nation Iodine X2.
[00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:23.373]  I walked in this morning and Weldon said, yeah, I took it off at 8 a.m.
[00:39:23.373 --> 00:39:24.253]  and said sold out.
[00:39:24.253 --> 00:39:27.716]  And I said, so you sold out of every bottle?
[00:39:27.716 --> 00:39:32.639]  And he said, well, we like to keep back about 200 for any breakage or any problems or any lost stuff.
[00:39:32.639 --> 00:39:33.460]  And I said, well, it really be 200?
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.521]  We'll have that many?
[00:39:35.521 --> 00:39:36.862]  He goes, no, I just like to keep a reserve.
[00:39:36.862 --> 00:39:38.123]  And I said, no, sell them all.
[00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:40.259]  I want to be totally sold out.
[00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:47.742]  So there's 200 bottles left at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:47.742 --> 00:39:51.823]  And we may get a limited supply in, in the next week or so, and that's it for a while.
[00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:54.824]  They'll be sold out of Survival Shield Nateson Iodine X2.
[00:39:54.824 --> 00:39:57.885]  We're trying to get more of the crystals, the pure deep earth source.
[00:39:57.885 --> 00:40:00.146]  Other iodines are kelp based.
[00:40:00.146 --> 00:40:03.287]  We've got the purest kelp based out there with Classic Survival Shield.
[00:40:03.287 --> 00:40:04.127]  It's excellent.
[00:40:04.127 --> 00:40:05.287]  It's not as strong.
[00:40:05.287 --> 00:40:06.408]  Folks like to give it to their kids.
[00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:12.071]  It's still an excellent product, not as strong or pure.
[00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:16.594]  It's not toxic and it doesn't have any additives or it's been tested, it's totally clean.
[00:40:16.594 --> 00:40:20.156]  It's just not 9-9-9-9 iodine.
[00:40:20.156 --> 00:40:22.437]  It's more like 9-9-something.
[00:40:22.437 --> 00:40:30.102]  But it's the next cleanest out there after our flagship product, Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:40:30.102 --> 00:40:36.286]  And it's your purchase of the breaking ground, cutting edge,
[00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:39.465]  Groundbreaking's the word.
[00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:44.615]  Products at Infowarslife.com that funds us engaging in real journalistic efforts.
[00:40:44.615 --> 00:40:46.740]  Where's the mainstream media covering Bilderberg?
[00:40:48.143 --> 00:40:57.711]  See, we'll force it, then they'll finally report on it when we get footage of the world leaders, the helicopters, the jets, the checkpoints, the attendees list.
[00:40:57.711 --> 00:40:59.532]  We'll force it to be covered.
[00:40:59.532 --> 00:41:02.554]  DrudgeReport.com will force it to be covered.
[00:41:02.554 --> 00:41:13.403]  In fact, you can go to DrudgeReport.com right now and link through to Bilderberg 2015 full attendee list and agenda, elitist confab to discuss artificial intelligence and more.
[00:41:13.403 --> 00:41:17.226]  I'll be breaking more of that down, but if I'm a bit breathless here,
[00:41:21.155 --> 00:41:28.482]  Because this is so amazing to be sitting here watching this.
[00:41:28.482 --> 00:41:32.685]  But mainstream media, it's come out on record, is ordered not to cover Bilderberg.
[00:41:32.685 --> 00:41:36.929]  They begrudgingly, the last few years, have been forced to cover it while making jokes about it.
[00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:40.332]  They made jokes a few years ago about TPP being secret.
[00:41:40.332 --> 00:41:47.099]  No one's laughing now when the top right-hand story on DrugsReport.com is Bilderberg.
[00:41:47.844 --> 00:41:54.268]  We salute Drudge for helping break the blockade and get this information out.
[00:41:54.268 --> 00:41:58.871]  We're going to expose the secret nature of this global private corporate government.
[00:41:58.871 --> 00:42:01.573]  We're going to expose the entire agenda.
[00:42:01.573 --> 00:42:03.234]  We're not going to back down.
[00:42:03.234 --> 00:42:04.335]  This is news.
[00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:08.778]  If 150 top movie stars were meeting in secret, it'd be huge news.
[00:42:08.778 --> 00:42:12.381]  If 150 soccer commissioners were meeting in secret, it'd be big news.
[00:42:13.081 --> 00:42:17.064]  If 150 NBA stars were meeting in secret, it'd be big news.
[00:42:17.064 --> 00:42:21.468]  If 150 NFL stars were meeting in secret, it'd be huge news.
[00:42:21.468 --> 00:42:24.990]  If 150 top tennis players were meeting, it'd be big news.
[00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:29.034]  If 150 top scientists were meeting in secret, it'd be big news.
[00:42:29.034 --> 00:42:31.976]  The secret makes it even more sinister.
[00:42:33.643 --> 00:42:35.064]  But the people have had the victory.
[00:42:35.064 --> 00:42:36.625]  We forced it out in the open.
[00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.407]  We forced a debate about it.
[00:42:38.407 --> 00:42:40.168]  Now we can get their annals.
[00:42:40.168 --> 00:42:42.490]  Now they're forced to release some of the information.
[00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.132]  Now they're forced out in the sun.
[00:42:44.132 --> 00:42:51.157]  And what happens to Count Dracula when he is pulled out of his Austrian castle into high noon sun?
[00:42:51.157 --> 00:42:55.801]  He politically lights up like a firebomb.
[00:42:55.801 --> 00:42:57.102]  He explodes.
[00:42:57.102 --> 00:42:58.964]  Those are all allegories.
[00:42:58.964 --> 00:43:01.306]  The vampires can't handle sunshine.
[00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:03.560]  The vampires are predators.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:12.267]  Well, the vampire slayers, politically, peacefully, are there covering the globalists that are taking over our world.
[00:43:12.267 --> 00:43:18.552]  And the Federal Police of Austria are scurrying around like good little hunting wolves.
[00:43:18.552 --> 00:43:25.598]  And it's not the first time Austria has served evil, is it?
[00:43:25.598 --> 00:43:29.601]  Not the first time they've had police dogs out harassing reporters.
[00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:30.442]  Not the first time.
[00:43:31.394 --> 00:43:33.255]  You know where it ended, Austria?
[00:43:33.255 --> 00:43:39.539]  It ended in a coup and the Nazi government coming and killing your leader and overthrowing Austria.
[00:43:39.539 --> 00:43:41.321]  Well, you're being overthrown by the EU.
[00:43:41.321 --> 00:43:44.783]  You're being overthrown by Bilderberg Group, who set it up.
[00:43:44.783 --> 00:43:46.284]  Take your country back!
[00:43:46.284 --> 00:43:47.525]  Act with some honor!
[00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:52.608]  Not like disgusting, filthy lapdogs!
[00:43:52.608 --> 00:43:59.773]  And oh, it was the Nazi Prince Bernhard, the SS officer who founded Bilderberg.
[00:43:59.773 --> 00:44:01.114]  So I guess you guys think it's cute.
[00:44:02.534 --> 00:44:06.415]  That a million Austrians and 20 million Germans died in World War II.
[00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:10.536]  Look what your black uniforms ended up costing you.
[00:44:10.536 --> 00:44:12.656]  So don't act like fascists.
[00:44:12.656 --> 00:44:14.136]  Leave the press alone.
[00:44:14.136 --> 00:44:14.536]  Stop it.
[00:44:14.536 --> 00:44:18.777]  In fact, I need the phone numbers for the federal police in Austria.
[00:44:18.777 --> 00:44:21.098]  I need the phone numbers of those local police as well.
[00:44:21.098 --> 00:44:22.858]  I want to make a whole story out of that.
[00:44:22.858 --> 00:44:27.859]  I want to call them on air today after the show and they all speak English and demand
[00:44:28.871 --> 00:44:29.772]  Demand.
[00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:30.953]  That they act like human beings.
[00:44:30.953 --> 00:44:31.834]  Demand.
[00:44:31.834 --> 00:44:33.356]  Or at least get it on record.
[00:44:33.356 --> 00:44:36.279]  That they're acting like SS thugs.
[00:44:36.279 --> 00:44:38.542]  Like Arnold Schwarzenegger's father.
[00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:49.694]  Alright, let's go back to... Robb Due, there in the Austrian Alps, six miles away from Bilderberg, where they've got checkpoints on the highways.
[00:44:49.694 --> 00:44:50.175]  Robb Due.
[00:44:51.288 --> 00:45:01.391]  So, while we were being interrogated right in front of our hotel, they would, a group would come up and they would talk to each other in German, Austrian German, whatever the dialect is.
[00:45:01.391 --> 00:45:02.331]  Same thing.
[00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:04.572]  And then the guy would translate in English.
[00:45:04.572 --> 00:45:07.413]  And I'm like, is he really saying that or are you just making that up?
[00:45:07.413 --> 00:45:09.173]  I mean, and it happened several times.
[00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:14.134]  He would come up and say something to each other.
[00:45:14.134 --> 00:45:14.835]  We're here.
[00:45:14.835 --> 00:45:16.795]  Now we don't want you to go up the road anymore.
[00:45:16.795 --> 00:45:18.176]  You can only go down the road.
[00:45:18.176 --> 00:45:19.516]  This is, this is your cutoff spot.
[00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:29.580]  Yeah, I would ask them while your Skype's breaking up, I would ask them, under what authority do you violate free movement?
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.263]  So are you saying, what area is an exclusion zone?
[00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:36.366]  Is there a Chernobyl taking place or something?
[00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:41.871]  I mean, are you putting a travel advisory out that people aren't welcome in this region of Austria?
[00:45:41.871 --> 00:45:43.352]  Under what authority do you operate?
[00:45:43.352 --> 00:45:44.353]  I want your superior.
[00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:47.213]  Well, and that is the whole secret.
[00:45:47.213 --> 00:45:51.775]  They don't want anybody to know about this, they just want to keep it under wraps, and they get a lot of help from the media.
[00:45:51.775 --> 00:46:02.480]  There's a publisher here, it's called Der Standard, his name's Oscar Bronner, he's been to several Bilderberg meetings, and he... Trust me not to.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.080]  Oh, okay.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.742]  150 of the world's richest, most powerful people get together, and there's nothing to write about.
[00:46:08.742 --> 00:46:10.303]  I mean, that's just insane.
[00:46:10.303 --> 00:46:11.043]  Totally insane.
[00:46:11.043 --> 00:46:12.304]  Rob, you're Scott Conout.
[00:46:12.304 --> 00:46:13.685]  What did you say about the publisher?
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:23.488]  The publisher, his name is Oskar Brauner, and he's publisher of Der Standard, D-E-R Standard, which means The Standard here in Austria.
[00:46:23.488 --> 00:46:25.931]  And he's been invited to several Bilderberg meetings.
[00:46:25.931 --> 00:46:29.735]  And he is told that you don't write about this, which is why he doesn't do it.
[00:46:29.735 --> 00:46:32.518]  He goes, well, they asked me not to, so I don't.
[00:46:32.518 --> 00:46:34.240]  And that's his way of getting into the club.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.301]  And that's in the newspaper.
[00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:36.102]  That's in the paper.
[00:46:36.102 --> 00:46:37.723]  I mean, they just admit all of this.
[00:46:37.723 --> 00:46:38.144]  It's sick.
[00:46:39.295 --> 00:46:39.955]  Yeah.
[00:46:39.955 --> 00:46:43.938]  But that's why you don't really hear about, they talk about it in these esoteric terms.
[00:46:43.938 --> 00:46:47.080]  They don't really get down to the meat and potatoes of what these guys are really discussing.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.962]  They go, oh, it's just, they just want to get together and talk in private.
[00:46:49.962 --> 00:46:52.064]  No big deal.
[00:46:52.064 --> 00:46:52.644]  Well, no big deal.
[00:46:52.644 --> 00:47:01.290]  Why do you have 2000 cops running around the hillside, climbing up the mountain, bugging us when we're just in our apartment editing video?
[00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.751]  I mean, we're not criminals.
[00:47:02.751 --> 00:47:06.974]  You know, our, our steak is a camera and our silver bullet is a microphone.
[00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:07.755]  That's all we have.
[00:47:08.365 --> 00:47:11.467]  That's all we have, and that's all we're going to keep bringing.
[00:47:11.467 --> 00:47:14.750]  So, we could just... They're just going to keep ramping it up, though.
[00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.011]  I can already feel it.
[00:47:16.011 --> 00:47:17.892]  They're parked right as we left our apartment.
[00:47:17.892 --> 00:47:26.959]  We shot a video going down from the apartment, coming down to here, past at least four different police vans and the checkpoint, and they had some more out on the trails.
[00:47:26.959 --> 00:47:29.460]  So, it's just going to keep continuing ramping up.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.743]  Hey, before we go to the break, I just want to do a little X2 plug here.
[00:47:32.743 --> 00:47:34.264]  I cut my finger on Saturday.
[00:47:34.264 --> 00:47:35.565]  I put X2 on a Band-Aid.
[00:47:36.886 --> 00:47:38.769]  Almost completely healed up at this point.
[00:47:38.769 --> 00:47:42.674]  Put a little X2 on a band-aid, wrapped it up, two days, almost gone.
[00:47:42.674 --> 00:47:44.136]  I mean, it truly is amazing stuff.
[00:47:44.136 --> 00:47:46.039]  By the way, that is not a planned plug.
[00:47:46.039 --> 00:47:51.387]  Well, everybody knows even the crummy iodine does miracles on cuts, but yes, that's what I use it for as well.
[00:47:52.423 --> 00:48:01.126]  Right, and that happened on Saturday night, so we're now Monday night, two days later, and it's, you know, it's not going to rip open anymore, it's just a little red.
[00:48:01.126 --> 00:48:06.828]  Amazing stuff, you know, and we do appreciate everybody out there who's supporting us because you're the reason that we're here.
[00:48:09.438 --> 00:48:16.460]  You're the reason that we're here, able to see all this, expose it for what it is, and get it out to you and the rest of the people out there who can't make it here.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:22.002]  It's by all those little contributions, by going and supporting us at the store, by getting a Prison Planet TV membership.
[00:48:22.002 --> 00:48:24.703]  We really do appreciate it, and we're going to have a lot more to come.
[00:48:24.703 --> 00:48:28.844]  I've got a whole confrontation when the cops were asking us for our passports.
[00:48:28.844 --> 00:48:31.345]  I have that on cell phone audio.
[00:48:31.345 --> 00:48:33.606]  I started recording immediately as they started coming up.
[00:48:34.867 --> 00:48:36.697]  Well, it looks like you have quite a bit of the video, too.
[00:48:36.697 --> 00:48:37.501]  We've already seen that.
[00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:38.827]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:48:40.345 --> 00:48:49.333]  Right, well there's the second confrontation, and if I could track that other guy down who's at the guest stand at the apartment, I think he was taking some pictures while we were surrounded by the cops.
[00:48:49.333 --> 00:48:57.761]  Absolutely, well just when you roll up the mountain to get footage at the checkpoint, we've already got some of those photos, they're on Infowars.com.
[00:48:57.761 --> 00:49:05.468]  Now again, if we can direct one of the document cams over here on the computer for TV viewers, I can show you, again, over 3,000 people there to hear me speak.
[00:49:06.368 --> 00:49:17.803]  And others speak, and no arrests, no problems, and we're talking less than half a mile away, up the hill, to where Bilderberg was meeting, outside London in Watford.
[00:49:17.803 --> 00:49:22.809]  All you do is search engine, Bilderberg, Watford, and you can see the whole thing
[00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:31.915]  There, and all they needed was one car of police over the fence for us, a fence that you could step over, and it was no big deal.
[00:49:31.915 --> 00:49:34.357]  They had members of Parliament come out and speak.
[00:49:34.357 --> 00:49:40.481]  They had a little fence they put up around the hotel itself, which was pointless, and there were no problems.
[00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:41.321]  Nothing happened.
[00:49:41.321 --> 00:49:46.845]  This idea that demonstrators or media are somehow dirty and bad shows
[00:49:48.004 --> 00:49:52.851]  How totalitarian the leadership of these organizations are.
[00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:54.934]  I mean, it's simply disgusting.
[00:49:54.934 --> 00:49:59.720]  In fact, here's a great aerial photo of the 3,000 plus people the police estimated.
[00:50:00.816 --> 00:50:01.036]  Yeah.
[00:50:01.036 --> 00:50:04.919]  Well, I just want to say that we're not doing anything wrong.
[00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:07.161]  We're just out here covering the fact that
[00:50:29.011 --> 00:50:43.902]  150 of the biggest, most powerful elites in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, Canada, the United States, are coming together for a meeting that they say is private, yet they want to force taxpayers to pay to have 2,000 federal police running around here terrorizing people.
[00:50:43.902 --> 00:50:44.483]  And that's wrong.
[00:50:44.483 --> 00:50:44.903]  That's right.
[00:50:44.903 --> 00:50:46.784]  And the people of Austin Street need to stand up.
[00:50:46.784 --> 00:50:48.005]  And that's in the newspaper.
[00:50:48.005 --> 00:50:54.690]  2,000 federal police to guard a group that has no power, but the media dare not report on it.
[00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:56.952]  But DrugsReport.com is reporting on it.
[00:50:56.952 --> 00:50:57.813]  Infowars.com.
[00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:03.769]  So Mark and I were talking about these looters, you know, in Baltimore and in Ferguson.
[00:51:03.769 --> 00:51:07.252]  Seems like every time there's some kind of an upset, the looters come out.
[00:51:07.252 --> 00:51:09.954]  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I'm a small business guy.
[00:51:09.954 --> 00:51:11.815]  Mark's a small business guy.
[00:51:11.815 --> 00:51:21.302]  And we go to Guns80.com and we get our AR-15 kits and we get our 30-shot magazines and we're ready for the looters if you get my drift.
[00:51:21.302 --> 00:51:22.042]  Hello.
[00:51:22.042 --> 00:51:23.984]  Don't wait for the powers that be.

[00:53:36.852 --> 00:53:37.092]  Thank you.
[00:54:01.619 --> 00:54:08.261]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:08.261 --> 00:54:16.183]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.183 --> 00:54:17.283]  Alright, I'm pretty excited.
[00:54:17.283 --> 00:54:21.124]  I'm gonna try to settle down here a little bit because there's some really hardcore gun news.
[00:54:22.523 --> 00:54:23.784]  You cannot make up this headline.
[00:54:23.784 --> 00:54:24.804]  It's from Breitbart.
[00:54:24.804 --> 00:54:26.125]  This is exactly what the U.S.
[00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:27.986]  Code is now saying.
[00:54:27.986 --> 00:54:29.266]  They put it in the Federal Register.
[00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:33.628]  That's where laws come from now is out of Obama's mouth, not even an executive order.
[00:54:33.628 --> 00:54:36.450]  Things just appear in the Federal Register.
[00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:41.632]  Obama to circumvent Congress with gag order on firearm coverage.
[00:54:41.632 --> 00:54:46.094]  And it says you will get government approval to talk about guns in any way.
[00:54:46.094 --> 00:54:48.836]  That's what the NRA is saying about the analysis of it.
[00:54:48.836 --> 00:54:50.716]  I agree with that analysis.
[00:54:50.716 --> 00:54:51.697]  That is coming up.
[00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:56.531]  Truly insane.
[00:54:56.531 --> 00:55:11.774]  Meanwhile, at this year's Bilderberg meeting, Google executive behind ingestible ID chips to attend Bilderberg 2015, former DARPA director, Regina Duggan, to discuss artificial intelligence with global power brokers.
[00:55:11.774 --> 00:55:17.555]  And we've got Josh Owen, who's been running camera, but also a great journalist, there on the ground with Rob Due.
[00:55:17.555 --> 00:55:22.736]  I wanted to get his take on what he's witnessed so far inside Austria compared to
[00:55:23.942 --> 00:55:29.328]  Bilderberg he covered last year in, what was it, in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:55:29.328 --> 00:55:31.230]  And the footage he's seen from other events.
[00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:34.713]  I've never seen, personally, such a police state response.
[00:55:34.713 --> 00:55:40.359]  Checkpoints six miles out and the police at your lodge.
[00:55:40.359 --> 00:55:41.460]  Simply amazing.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.061]  Josh Owens.
[00:55:43.513 --> 00:55:45.314]  Josh Owens, Infowars.com.
[00:55:45.314 --> 00:55:48.995]  Yeah, it's the juxtaposition here with how beautiful it is.
[00:55:48.995 --> 00:56:01.379]  When we flew in, I was, you know, jet-lagged, half-asleep on the plane, and all of a sudden, through the clouds, you see these snow-peaked mountains and these little rivers running down the mountain from the snow melting, and it's just beautiful.
[00:56:01.379 --> 00:56:07.340]  And then I was driving, after we got our car, I was driving through Innsbruck to Telfs, and it was almost out of nowhere.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.921]  We had just started going up the mountain,
[00:56:09.944 --> 00:56:17.569]  A ways away from our place we're staying and definitely a ways away from the Interalpen Hotel where they're having Bilderberg this year.
[00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:24.253]  And all of a sudden we turned a corner and there's this big checkpoint with these huge cops just standing there.
[00:56:24.253 --> 00:56:33.218]  And I don't know the average demeanor of Austrian police, but they didn't seem like they were messing around.
[00:56:33.218 --> 00:56:35.900]  They seemed very angry.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.561]  And so they asked for our papers.
[00:56:39.687 --> 00:56:42.988]  All the while, you're looking around at how beautiful this place is.
[00:56:42.988 --> 00:56:44.588]  It's almost unbelievable.
[00:56:44.588 --> 00:56:46.869]  It's almost cinematic, like it's not even real.
[00:56:46.869 --> 00:56:48.389]  Like it's a movie.
[00:56:48.389 --> 00:57:03.352]  And then when we go to our little cabin, and I'm looking out the window, I have the window open, letting the breeze blow in, and all of a sudden you see them, after they've already confronted us once, you see them marching down this hill, eight or nine of them, and
[00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:12.518]  I think the reason during the interaction I got so angry is because I didn't capture that on film because it looked literally like a movie.
[00:57:12.518 --> 00:57:18.644]  They were marching down to our room and my window was open and I had some of my equipment out getting ready to do the live show.
[00:57:19.384 --> 00:57:32.252]  And they literally peered in the window and saw that we had a microphone, and then they started speaking in German to each other, pointing out the microphone like I had some, like, Alibaba sword or some shotgun in there.
[00:57:32.252 --> 00:57:33.553]  And they're like, microphone, microphone, what is that?
[00:57:33.553 --> 00:57:33.934]  What is that?
[00:57:33.934 --> 00:57:35.394]  What is that?
[00:57:35.394 --> 00:57:37.616]  And it's ridiculous.
[00:57:37.616 --> 00:57:43.940]  It's completely... I'm not saying that Copenhagen, Denmark last year was a cakewalk.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.801]  It was, you know, there were some issues there too.
[00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:51.347]  They detained me because someone called the police on me for carrying a camera.
[00:57:51.347 --> 00:57:52.890]  That was ridiculous.
[00:57:52.890 --> 00:58:00.062]  But in the end, you know, they let us go and they weren't really being the Austrian intimidation that we've seen since we've been here.
[00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:05.684]  Well, look out, or Austria will try to basically invade us next, invade the First Amendment.
[00:58:05.684 --> 00:58:08.447]  I mean, I guess Hitler's striking back.
[00:58:08.447 --> 00:58:09.528]  Really shameful.
[00:58:09.528 --> 00:58:16.176]  So, any other observations we're going to get to in 60 seconds, 70 seconds, when we start the next hour.
[00:58:16.176 --> 00:58:21.662]  Then we have a special guest joining us, but you guys are welcome to go to other reports.
[00:58:22.543 --> 00:58:23.343]  Or go to bed.
[00:58:23.343 --> 00:58:25.624]  I know it's been a long time since you've been asleep.
[00:58:25.624 --> 00:58:29.946]  I know you left Sunday morning from Austin, Texas.
[00:58:29.946 --> 00:58:33.988]  But Doug Casey of Casey Research is going to be joining us on the economy.
[00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:39.310]  But when we come back, we'll ask you how long it's been since Josh Owens slept.
[00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:42.792]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.792 --> 00:58:44.032]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:59.534]  Former DARPA Director and now Google Executive Regina Dugan will be attending the secretive 2015 Bilderberg Conference this year in Austria.
[00:58:59.534 --> 00:59:08.739]  Dugan, who is helping to develop and promote the idea of implantable microchips, will be there to head up the discussion on artificial intelligence.
[00:59:08.739 --> 00:59:13.141]  Regina Dugan is also an advocate for ingestible microchips.
[00:59:13.141 --> 00:59:16.483]  That's right, tiny microchips inside little pills.
[00:59:16.983 --> 00:59:33.375]  That users would swallow daily in order to obtain what Dugan describes as superpowers by having your entire body act as a biological authentication system for cell phones, cars, door locks, and other devices.
[00:59:33.375 --> 00:59:39.719]  And she is quick to point out that these microchip pills have already been approved by the FDA.
[00:59:39.719 --> 00:59:46.144]  For the complete list of this year's Bilderberg attendees, be sure to check out InfoWars.com.
[00:59:51.227 --> 00:59:53.852]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.131]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.131 --> 01:00:07.892]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:09.653]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.653 --> 01:00:11.233]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.794 --> 01:00:16.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.976 --> 01:00:22.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:27.362]  Bilderberg 2015 has kicked off with, well, some real sparks.
[01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:37.751]  The horrible, evil Josh Owens and Rob Dew, men with no criminal records and long journalistic background histories, have entered into Austria.
[01:00:37.751 --> 01:00:40.212]  Of course, our names are all on list.
[01:00:40.212 --> 01:00:42.793]  We announced who was going in to begin with.
[01:00:42.793 --> 01:00:58.182]  And the Austrian police, six miles away from where the Bilderberg group's going to be meeting in four days, have checkpoints on the roads and have been harassing them, going to their hotel, sticking their head in their windows, following them.
[01:01:00.114 --> 01:01:04.878]  Being, I guess you could say, aggressive and rude.
[01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:07.821]  Really unprecedented.
[01:01:07.821 --> 01:01:12.605]  And Josh was getting to some of the other observations he made there.
[01:01:12.605 --> 01:01:19.591]  Josh, for me, this is really big news that you've got the group behind the EU, the TPP, the globalists, the top globalists.
[01:01:20.489 --> 01:01:29.977]  We're forcing the media to cover that Bilderberg's real, and they're so arrogant they've ordered the police, the federal police, with taxpayers paying for it, to harass reporters.
[01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:34.060]  Don't they know that continues to blow up in their face politically?
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:40.225]  I mean, the only other place that acted like this was Canada, when they had me arrested for 15 hours for no reason.
[01:01:40.225 --> 01:01:43.828]  And so I guess they might be dumb enough to actually arrest you, so be really careful.
[01:01:43.828 --> 01:01:44.128]  Go ahead.
[01:01:45.905 --> 01:01:46.405]  Right, yeah.
[01:01:46.405 --> 01:01:50.469]  I mean, I think it's almost as if they enjoy the villain appeal.
[01:01:50.469 --> 01:01:51.730]  I mean, look at this back here.
[01:01:51.730 --> 01:02:01.277]  It's these, uh, the Alps with fog drifting up over the trees, and then they're in this castle up there in the middle of nowhere.
[01:02:01.277 --> 01:02:04.039]  I mean, it really is like the villain's lair in a movie.
[01:02:04.039 --> 01:02:05.480]  It is!
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.921]  And don't forget who their security is.
[01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:10.245]  Exactly.
[01:02:10.245 --> 01:02:11.386]  It's unreal.
[01:02:11.386 --> 01:02:13.367]  But just the icing on the cake.
[01:02:13.367 --> 01:02:19.071]  And I know the guy who I'm about to mention is going to see this because he looked at the website.
[01:02:19.071 --> 01:02:26.896]  There was literally a guy, I swear to God, he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Terminator with his red eye popping out, his machine eye popping out.
[01:02:26.896 --> 01:02:30.678]  When he was telling us, because we asked him, what trails can we go on?
[01:02:30.678 --> 01:02:33.360]  You know, we were trying to comply and be nice because they were being so
[01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.982]  Obsessively ridiculous.
[01:02:36.982 --> 01:02:39.542]  And he was just like, this is not for you.
[01:02:39.542 --> 01:02:40.643]  This is not for you.
[01:02:40.643 --> 01:02:42.163]  Where you are now is as far as you can go.
[01:02:42.163 --> 01:02:43.063]  This is not for you.
[01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.224]  These trails are not for you.
[01:02:44.224 --> 01:02:49.065]  All while his eye was pulsating this red, like, magma.
[01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:51.106]  I'm really upset that I didn't get any of this on film.
[01:02:51.106 --> 01:02:54.987]  Well, they were trying to intimidate you and, you know, they saw what happened in World War II and they tried that.
[01:02:56.445 --> 01:02:57.626]  I mean, 20 million dead.
[01:02:57.626 --> 01:03:00.688]  And we're not the ones they're threatening or being aggressive.
[01:03:00.688 --> 01:03:02.389]  We're just simply trying to be free.
[01:03:02.389 --> 01:03:04.710]  They want to follow the orders of evil people.
[01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.511]  I don't know why they're obsessed with that.
[01:03:06.511 --> 01:03:10.574]  Look, there are a lot of good Austrians, a lot of great Germans.
[01:03:10.574 --> 01:03:12.435]  In fact, probably more so than even Americans.
[01:03:12.435 --> 01:03:14.456]  At least more Germans are awake politically.
[01:03:14.456 --> 01:03:16.537]  They're either super evil or super good.
[01:03:16.537 --> 01:03:25.723]  But I would talk to some locals and say, do you like a secret global group meeting in secret and trying to run your life?
[01:03:26.783 --> 01:03:31.506]  And I think you're going to find the Austrians don't like it.
[01:03:31.506 --> 01:03:31.887]  Absolutely.
[01:03:31.887 --> 01:03:33.107]  I'm sure that's definitely true.
[01:03:33.107 --> 01:03:35.169]  And I'm in no way bashing every Austrian.
[01:03:35.169 --> 01:03:36.450]  I'm just bashing this one guy.
[01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:37.511]  I'm not really bashing him.
[01:03:37.511 --> 01:03:38.311]  I'm just telling him.
[01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:39.132]  I'm just telling you my perspective.
[01:03:39.132 --> 01:03:40.353]  Well, no, I mean, it's the stereotype.
[01:03:40.353 --> 01:03:42.074]  It's what Estalin said on air.
[01:03:42.074 --> 01:03:44.355]  He said, oh, my gosh, Austria is a horrible police state.
[01:03:44.355 --> 01:03:44.756]  Get ready.
[01:03:44.756 --> 01:03:47.458]  And then off air, he was like, oh, you better watch it, Alex.
[01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:48.238]  They're bad.
[01:03:48.238 --> 01:03:50.520]  And now we're finding out.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.801]  Man, you think I should?
[01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:55.183]  It's not three miles down the road like the abortion clinic.
[01:03:55.183 --> 01:03:56.484]  Should I jump on an airplane and come out there?
[01:03:58.274 --> 01:03:58.654]  I don't know.
[01:03:58.654 --> 01:04:00.556]  I think maybe... I'm tempted.
[01:04:00.556 --> 01:04:02.137]  I mean, I'm just going to get in those guys' face.
[01:04:02.137 --> 01:04:04.559]  I'm sick of it, man.
[01:04:04.559 --> 01:04:06.681]  I mean, just say to them, what's your problem?
[01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:08.342]  I'm here trying to cover this.
[01:04:08.342 --> 01:04:10.003]  This is a national park.
[01:04:10.003 --> 01:04:11.785]  Are you saying I don't have access?
[01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:14.047]  That's a human rights violation.
[01:04:14.047 --> 01:04:16.369]  I think you should push them, Josh, if I was you.
[01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:20.832]  Push them politically with your rights as a citizen under the Geneva Convention.
[01:04:20.832 --> 01:04:21.613]  Tell them that.
[01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:26.256]  Say, are you going to violate the Geneva and Nuremberg Conventions again?
[01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:26.697]  Ask them that.
[01:04:28.706 --> 01:04:29.566]  All right, absolutely.
[01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:30.527]  I will.
[01:04:30.527 --> 01:04:35.308]  After 24 plus hours of no sleep, I'm a little bit jet-lagged, but let me get a nice... No, no, no, yeah.
[01:04:35.308 --> 01:04:36.168]  Don't do it tonight.
[01:04:36.168 --> 01:04:38.049]  In fact, I meant to ask that question.
[01:04:38.049 --> 01:04:40.310]  How long since you've had no sleep?
[01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:40.730]  I don't know.
[01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.910]  Over 24 hours.
[01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:44.411]  Well, you've done well.
[01:04:44.411 --> 01:04:46.972]  So, you and dude, go get some sleep.
[01:04:46.972 --> 01:04:47.572]  Good job.
[01:04:47.572 --> 01:04:48.312]  Get up.
[01:04:48.312 --> 01:04:48.792]  Up and at them.
[01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:55.354]  They're probably going to roust you out of your beds tonight, so have those cameras ready and plugged in and on.
[01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:56.995]  It's definitely going to be fireworks, folks.
[01:04:59.494 --> 01:05:06.180]  Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but back in my day, a school field trip consisted of a sack lunch and a trip to the zoo.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:12.646]  But now they've upped the ante in places like Minneapolis, where a private school is taking their kids to a sex shop.
[01:05:12.646 --> 01:05:13.527]  That's right.
[01:05:13.527 --> 01:05:21.654]  Multiple news outlets are reporting that parents are demanding school chiefs' removal after she took a group to the smitten kitten for sex education class.
[01:05:22.074 --> 01:05:28.300]  And as you might imagine, a place like the Smitten Kitten has several objects that you won't find in gym class.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:33.164]  And while the school has not been available for direct comment, they did issue a statement.
[01:05:33.164 --> 01:05:38.949]  Gaia Democratic Schools Board of Directors stands behind the premise of the field trip, the statement said.
[01:05:38.949 --> 01:05:45.715]  We view it as a legitimate learning experience that relates directly to the topics covered during our year-long sexual health class.
[01:05:46.155 --> 01:05:52.067]  Some parents like Steven Strahmat are mad as hell and have already removed their children from the school.
[01:05:52.067 --> 01:05:55.814]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:05:58.872 --> 01:05:59.633]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:05:59.633 --> 01:06:00.214]  Good, brother.
[01:06:00.214 --> 01:06:01.935]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:01.935 --> 01:06:03.878]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:03.878 --> 01:06:07.922]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.525]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:10.525 --> 01:06:12.947]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:12.947 --> 01:06:20.836]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:21.096 --> 01:06:24.360]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.902]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:28.945]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:30.587]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:35.913]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:38.435]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:06:38.435 --> 01:06:50.445]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:06:50.445 --> 01:06:57.391]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:00.067]  Another major health threat.
[01:07:00.067 --> 01:07:05.049]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:05.049 --> 01:07:07.730]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:14.773]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:14.773 --> 01:07:17.754]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:17.754 --> 01:07:20.715]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:20.715 --> 01:07:22.716]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:22.716 --> 01:07:25.577]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:25.657 --> 01:07:31.381]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:34.884]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.986]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:42.269]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:45.290]  For every modern independently minded household.
[01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:48.512]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:07:57.496 --> 01:08:03.899]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.899 --> 01:08:06.740]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.079 --> 01:08:31.404]  We're going to be talking to a multi-time number one New York Times best-selling author, Doug Casey.
[01:08:31.404 --> 01:08:33.785]  He's been a guest here several times.
[01:08:33.785 --> 01:08:41.089]  Been familiar with his work for 25 years, but had a chance to speak at one of his events in San Antonio, I guess it was last year.
[01:08:41.089 --> 01:08:42.490]  Time just flies.
[01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:43.550]  caseyresearch.com
[01:08:45.265 --> 01:08:52.887]  And, of course, he is the best-selling author known for exposing how to be an international person.
[01:08:52.887 --> 01:08:54.687]  Now, that's the opposite of being a globalist.
[01:08:54.687 --> 01:09:00.128]  The globalists want one global system that central banks control where there is no freedom.
[01:09:00.128 --> 01:09:05.549]  The international man knows how to work outside of that system and stay one step ahead of them.
[01:09:05.549 --> 01:09:13.491]  Plus, the globalists like to leave escape valves, escape hatches, kind of like they live with the watches, for themselves.
[01:09:16.949 --> 01:09:21.452]  And his books, his newsletters, his information helps expose all of that.
[01:09:21.452 --> 01:09:23.194]  He is the cutting edge of that.
[01:09:23.194 --> 01:09:27.597]  We have so many expert guests on and they say, you know, who I listen to, Doug Casey.
[01:09:27.597 --> 01:09:28.898]  So we're honored to have him.
[01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:42.567]  This with the backdrop of the globalists setting up the TPP that Congress can't read, that sets up one-sided trade deals for insiders, censors the internet, tries to end cash globally, tries to track all transactions.
[01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:44.829]  It's simply out of control.
[01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:56.993]  We have our reporters at Bilderberg, where these 150 crony capitalists are meeting, and six miles out from the meeting house, four days till it starts, they've got checkpoints on the highways.
[01:09:56.993 --> 01:10:03.316]  Those videos, all of that is up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:10:04.557 --> 01:10:10.000]  On the top of the right-hand side has Bilderberg 2015 full attendee list and agenda.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.263]  The latest confab to discuss artificial intelligence.
[01:10:13.263 --> 01:10:16.424]  So we'll be breaking that down coming up in the third hour.
[01:10:16.424 --> 01:10:23.249]  Getting into speaking of executive power grabs, we reported on this Saturday, if you don't believe us or the NRA, Breitbart
[01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:30.751]  As their headline, Obama to circumvent Congress with gag order, that's a quote, on firearm coverage.
[01:10:30.751 --> 01:10:35.333]  So they're now saying, firearms are so dangerous, we'll decide what speech is allowed with guns.
[01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:37.554]  And we're going to put it in the Federal Register.
[01:10:38.393 --> 01:10:51.543]  By the State Department, the same people that banned putting the design for 3D printable guns last year, they said we'll indict anyone in the world who puts these designs on the internet as if they are the global power.
[01:10:51.543 --> 01:11:05.914]  Just like the US just indicted, you know, 40 plus FIFA members, which I'm sure there's some corruption, but this is like Satan sitting in judgment of a low-level demon, you know, Stinkertail or whatever.
[01:11:06.693 --> 01:11:09.874]  A low-level demon that can't even, you know, wipe its nose.
[01:11:09.874 --> 01:11:13.895]  This is like Hitler sitting in judgment at Nuremberg in the Nazi party.
[01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:19.856]  I mean, this is, or Heinrich Himmler, or Hermann Goring, or Zeb Dietrich.
[01:11:19.856 --> 01:11:27.318]  I mean, this is just a mind-spinning joke to see all of this unfolding.
[01:11:27.318 --> 01:11:30.399]  The good news is, it's in the headlines today, we'll talk about this.
[01:11:31.519 --> 01:11:34.920]  Obama wants to bring in illegals, give them free everything as a new voting bloc.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:42.641]  I'm for sovereignty, but I'm for having borders somewhat open, international travel, if you don't have welfare.
[01:11:42.641 --> 01:11:46.562]  But if you have a bunch of welfare, people will come there, they'll use it, they'll implode you.
[01:11:46.562 --> 01:11:48.342]  And that's the plan, of course.
[01:11:48.342 --> 01:11:59.025]  But federal courts now, three of them have ruled that Obama just saying borders are open magically is illegal, so he's now publicly backed off that initiative, but Soros is still funding it.
[01:11:59.025 --> 01:12:00.405]  We've got that news as well.
[01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:06.505]  Doug Casey is the chairman of Casey Research, best-selling author, world-renowned speculator, and libertarian philosopher.
[01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:12.890]  Doug Casey has garnered a well-earned reputation for his insights into politics, economics, and investment markets.
[01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:17.054]  Doug is widely respected as one of the preeminent authorities on rational speculation.
[01:12:17.674 --> 01:12:20.755]  Especially in the high potential natural resource sector.
[01:12:20.755 --> 01:12:26.637]  Doug literally wrote the book on profiting from periods of economic turmoil, which we're entering big time.
[01:12:26.637 --> 01:12:35.181]  His book, Crisis Investing, spent multiple weeks on the number one New York Times bestselling list and became the bestselling financial book of 1980.
[01:12:35.181 --> 01:12:41.263]  Surpassing big caliber names like Free to Choose by Milton Friedman and The Real War by Richard Nixon.
[01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.415]  And Cosmos by Carl Sagan.
[01:12:44.415 --> 01:12:45.275]  Cosmos.
[01:12:45.275 --> 01:12:47.217]  KCResearch.com.
[01:12:47.217 --> 01:12:53.301]  Okay, I threw out a cornucopia, Doug, of things that are happening, things that are going on.
[01:12:53.301 --> 01:13:01.348]  Two weeks ago, I tried to get you on the show about some international issues taking place, and the war on people trying to expatriate and
[01:13:02.088 --> 01:13:04.489]  Capital control starting to go in.
[01:13:04.489 --> 01:13:07.930]  Big global banks are meeting, openly saying, in cash.
[01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.790]  What do you make of all this activity?
[01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:11.931]  Where is the state-of-the-world economy right now?
[01:13:11.931 --> 01:13:15.912]  And what is Doug Casey doing to protect himself?
[01:13:15.912 --> 01:13:19.213]  Well, Alex, it's great to be here.
[01:13:19.213 --> 01:13:25.315]  And I agree with everything you've said so far and enjoyed listening to you.
[01:13:25.315 --> 01:13:31.197]  As far as what's going to happen, let me give you a quote from Ray Bradbury.
[01:13:31.815 --> 01:13:36.858]  He says something wicked this way comes, and that's exactly what's going on in the world today.
[01:13:36.858 --> 01:13:51.506]  On just about every front, the military front, the economic front, the social front, the political front, we're really heading into something really nasty.
[01:13:51.506 --> 01:13:57.849]  So it's a matter of great concern, and I think that your listeners
[01:13:58.704 --> 01:14:00.345]  It shouldn't just be listening.
[01:14:00.345 --> 01:14:18.272]  They should be acting about this, because there's an excellent chance that even a year from now, even six months from now, it could be a month from now, the whole world is going to be turned inside out and upside down in a lot of different ways.
[01:14:18.272 --> 01:14:19.252]  So where should we start?
[01:14:19.252 --> 01:14:20.452]  You know what?
[01:14:20.452 --> 01:14:21.533]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:14:21.533 --> 01:14:23.333]  Start wherever you want.
[01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:26.935]  Well, I have to agree with you, first of all, what you said about FIFA.
[01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:36.237]  Most Americans really don't give a damn about soccer.
[01:14:36.237 --> 01:14:51.930]  I mean, most of what we know about soccer relates back to Brandi Chastain back in 1999 when she ripped her jersey off and displayed a wonderful body when she scored that winning goal against the Chinese women's team in a FIFA tournament.
[01:14:53.618 --> 01:14:58.541]  You know, so they're making a big deal out of a bribery scandal in FIFO.
[01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:04.345]  But you know, most people are unaware that FIFO is a private group.
[01:15:04.345 --> 01:15:06.146]  It's been around for a hundred years.
[01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:10.649]  It's controlled by the guys that run it.
[01:15:10.649 --> 01:15:13.211]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:18.655]  Their main job is to designate what the rules are for football.
[01:15:19.756 --> 01:15:20.117]  We're good.
[01:15:37.458 --> 01:15:44.661]  Sure, they're paying themselves well, but it's nothing compared to the kind of theft that goes on with governments themselves.
[01:15:44.661 --> 01:15:50.583]  Well sure, I mean, the big banks spend like $2 billion of the $3 billion spent in a U.S.
[01:15:50.583 --> 01:16:01.147]  election operation, and really from what I've seen, that's all they're doing is going in and giving money to local sporting organizations as part of a profit-sharing operation.
[01:16:01.147 --> 01:16:04.928]  It just seems like the mafia that runs our country thinks it controls the whole world.
[01:16:05.393 --> 01:16:08.675]  Well, that's right, Alex, and that is the most disturbing thing about it.
[01:16:08.675 --> 01:16:20.803]  99% of all the people that watch soccer, that play soccer, all the soccer that's played, it's all outside of the United States.
[01:16:20.803 --> 01:16:24.985]  And these people they've indicted, they're all foreigners.
[01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:40.008]  It's like the US government, of all people, has become the world's moral arbiter and the world's policeman, where they're actually going to...
[01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:49.312]  Foreign governments and getting these foreign citizens extradited to stand trial back in the U.S.
[01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:51.473]  for violating American laws.
[01:16:51.473 --> 01:17:02.416]  And they're nonsense laws, like money laundering, which only became a crime, was manufactured as a crime, only about 30 years ago.
[01:17:04.136 --> 01:17:06.738]  This is all shocking.
[01:17:06.738 --> 01:17:10.801]  I mean, nobody's safe anywhere in the world from the reach of the U.S.
[01:17:10.801 --> 01:17:12.462]  government anymore.
[01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:15.164]  This is just one more example.
[01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:19.127]  It's the same class as last year when the U.S.
[01:17:19.127 --> 01:17:28.855]  sent a SWAT team into New Zealand to attack Kim Dotcom, who's a German citizen and was violating no laws.
[01:17:29.415 --> 01:17:33.157]  Either in New Zealand, or... Well sure, let's expand on that.
[01:17:33.157 --> 01:17:36.759]  Law lets IRS seize accounts on suspicion, no crime required.
[01:17:36.759 --> 01:17:40.060]  That's the money laundering law that's written to be so broad.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:46.824]  Outside of law, a 40 plus year Mexican restaurant that's got like 8 seats, deposits the cash every day.
[01:17:46.824 --> 01:17:48.605]  They admit the cash is all clean.
[01:17:48.605 --> 01:17:54.648]  They're putting it in a bank, so they steal the woman's $37,000 life savings.
[01:17:54.648 --> 01:17:57.069]  I mean, it's just crazy what our government's turned into.
[01:17:57.691 --> 01:18:00.453]  Yeah, it is.
[01:18:00.453 --> 01:18:07.857]  It's really turned into a cancer that's metastasizing, and it's taken on a life of its own at this point.
[01:18:07.857 --> 01:18:22.065]  It's a great matter of concern, and it's one reason why I really emphasize internationalizing yourself so that you're not totally under the control of the U.S.
[01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:22.466]  government.
[01:18:24.007 --> 01:18:33.133]  The risk in the financial markets is extreme, but it's nothing compared to the political risk that you have from your own government.
[01:18:35.808 --> 01:18:36.969]  Very, very disturbing.
[01:18:36.969 --> 01:18:53.161]  What do you think spurring the power trip to have our, I know you're an expert on this, our government starting a war with Russia, starting a war with China, and we're not lionizing Russia or China, but they're not the ones aggressively, especially Russia, doing this, and it even came out in mainstream news today that our government admits
[01:18:54.022 --> 01:19:02.606]  They tried to overthrow Egypt, our ally, and put the Muslim Brotherhood in, so now Egypt's joined Russia and doing joint naval patrols.
[01:19:02.606 --> 01:19:09.589]  Why would they double-cross 35-year allies and put radicals in that chop Christians' heads off?
[01:19:09.589 --> 01:19:13.231]  Has our government gone criminally insane?
[01:19:13.231 --> 01:19:18.773]  I think that's a reasonable way to describe it, actually, Alex.
[01:19:18.773 --> 01:19:22.135]  And looking at this brouhaha in
[01:19:22.765 --> 01:19:30.707]  The Eastern Ukraine, what we have there are two provinces that are populated mainly by Russian speakers.
[01:19:30.707 --> 01:19:33.307]  The Ukraine isn't a real country anyway.
[01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:49.391]  It's kind of a political intertidal zone where a bunch of nationalities are caught between Russia and Romania and so forth.
[01:19:50.265 --> 01:19:59.028]  So these two provinces want to split off from the bankrupt and corrupt Ukrainian government and become independent.
[01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:00.768]  And the U.S.
[01:20:00.768 --> 01:20:07.110]  is backing the corrupt Ukrainian government in making these two provinces stay part of the Ukraine.
[01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:11.972]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:20:11.972 --> 01:20:14.433]  And they're trying to implicate the Russians in this.
[01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:18.654]  Of course, the Russians are sympathetic to these people because they're
[01:20:19.378 --> 01:20:32.184]  They're also Russians, and they'd like to see a border country in between them and the Ukraine, which, of course, the Americans are trying to get into NATO.
[01:20:32.184 --> 01:20:36.606]  But, you know, this is like asking to start World War III.
[01:20:36.606 --> 01:20:37.887]  It really is criminally insane.
[01:20:40.583 --> 01:20:47.106]  You, again, are the best-selling author who broke down how to be an international individual, seeing this whole thing coming.
[01:20:47.106 --> 01:20:48.627]  And you've seen booms and busts.
[01:20:48.627 --> 01:20:52.549]  You've been credited for making folks a lot of money that listen to your strategies.
[01:20:52.549 --> 01:20:55.190]  And I want to get some of those strategies with you coming up in the next segment.
[01:20:55.190 --> 01:21:07.196]  But in the eight or nine minutes before we go to break, Doug Casey of caseyresearch.com, looking at all the world news and this acceleration towards classical totalitarianism,
[01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:22.870]  Do you think it's a conscious move, or just the fact that different political elites have nothing holding them back, they've gotten away with so much, and so they're just slouching into a form of fascistic decadence?
[01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:33.516]  Well, they're definitely doing that, but I guess the question is, is it a conscious move, or is it just something that happens with a life of its own?
[01:21:35.911 --> 01:21:42.555]  I think it's a result of the fact that you've got two kinds of people in the world.
[01:21:42.555 --> 01:21:47.578]  You've got people that like to control physical reality, and I like those kind of people.
[01:21:47.578 --> 01:21:50.120]  They're what improve the world.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:56.504]  And then you've got another class of people, and those are people that like to control other people.
[01:21:56.504 --> 01:22:00.867]  And that's the type of person that gets into government, that goes into politics.
[01:22:02.179 --> 01:22:06.940]  So, actually, it's not the best and the brightest people that go into government.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:15.822]  It's the lowest and most degraded types that are attracted to the seat of power where they can control other people.
[01:22:15.822 --> 01:22:27.784]  So, since that's the nature of the government, that it attracts that type of personality, it's inevitable that the government becomes
[01:22:28.855 --> 01:22:32.778]  Worse and more malignant as time goes on.
[01:22:32.778 --> 01:22:38.963]  Sure, and our system, as you know, was the founders who were the opposite, true renaissance men and women.
[01:22:38.963 --> 01:22:44.687]  They wanted a small government set up to try to keep that at bay for a while.
[01:22:44.687 --> 01:22:50.913]  The problem is, the paradox, that free system, not perfect but freer than any other, created so much wealth
[01:22:51.593 --> 01:23:03.638]  That the government, even though it had a small tax, became large and fat and arrogant, the people became decadent, and now we're about to wake up homeless on the continent our forbearers conquered.
[01:23:03.638 --> 01:23:05.959]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:23:05.959 --> 01:23:14.122]  The situation has actually gotten out of control, and the government is so big and so powerful at this point that it can't be reversed.
[01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:15.423]  You know, even if Ron Paul
[01:23:16.212 --> 01:23:19.435]  Uh, was elected, uh, the last time.
[01:23:19.435 --> 01:23:39.631]  It wouldn't have done any good, because the first thing that would have happened to him, I believe, is he would have been sat down by the heads of various praetorian agencies, like the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and a dozen others like that, plus a bunch of generals and admirals, and they would have told him the way the game is played.
[01:23:39.631 --> 01:23:42.653]  And if he didn't play it, his life would be at risk.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:49.203]  And if for some reason he dodged those bullets, he'd be indicted by the U.S.
[01:23:49.203 --> 01:23:50.503]  Congress.
[01:23:50.503 --> 01:24:03.549]  And if for some reason that didn't work, the average American would be out in the street rioting because his rice bowl was going to be broken, because the average American at this point gets more from the government than he pays in taxes.
[01:24:03.549 --> 01:24:07.051]  Not that I believe we should even have taxes.
[01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:09.812]  Well sure, but that's where I was going to go next, is they'd probably
[01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:22.578]  He'd make some economic announcement, they manipulate the stock market, that's on record now, they would just dive it for a week, claim he did it, and all these fools would then say, run him out on a rail, they would support his impeachment.
[01:24:22.578 --> 01:24:31.583]  Yeah, I think you're right, Alex, and I'm afraid that when the next crisis really blows up in the next little while,
[01:24:32.592 --> 01:24:36.155]  Uh, the American people, Ubus Americanus, as H.L.
[01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:42.259]  Mencken said, is going to clamor for somebody to kiss it all and make it better.
[01:24:42.259 --> 01:24:48.164]  We could very well wind up with some type of a military dictatorship in this country as the next step.
[01:24:48.164 --> 01:24:51.046]  Well, that's what General Tommy Franks told Cigar Aficionado in 2013.
[01:24:51.046 --> 01:24:53.187]  Hmm.
[01:24:53.187 --> 01:24:54.949]  I'm a fan of Cigar Aficionado.
[01:24:54.949 --> 01:24:57.210]  Do you like cigars, too?
[01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:58.511]  I do like them.
[01:24:58.511 --> 01:25:01.634]  And, of course, the type I like, they try to embargo.
[01:25:03.635 --> 01:25:04.156]  That's right.
[01:25:04.156 --> 01:25:12.640]  Well, when I see you next, we're going to have to sit down over a whiskey and a cigar and chat about all this stuff at leisure.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:20.565]  But of course, tobacco is becoming illegal in this country, so we might have to smoke that cigar someplace outside of the U.S.
[01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:22.641]  It's amazing.
[01:25:22.641 --> 01:25:26.383]  From Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, to the Land of... What would you call America now?
[01:25:26.383 --> 01:25:29.684]  Because there's still a lot of great people here.
[01:25:29.684 --> 01:25:32.865]  I'd call most of them whipped dogs at this point.
[01:25:32.865 --> 01:25:33.925]  They're whipped dogs.
[01:25:33.925 --> 01:25:40.368]  And when somebody in a uniform points a finger at them, they roll over on their backs and wet themselves.
[01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:42.248]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:25:42.248 --> 01:25:46.910]  I mean, the idea of America is dead in the United States at this point.
[01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:54.723]  It certainly is, and the constabulary itself are a bunch of whip dogs scared following orders.
[01:25:54.723 --> 01:26:01.004]  I do see, though, in the federal government and at state levels, we get a lot of leaks, a lot of good intel.
[01:26:01.004 --> 01:26:07.366]  As bad as the government is, per capita, there are more awake people I'm finding now in government because they know
[01:26:08.146 --> 01:26:11.728]  That things are getting really corrupt than I even see in the general population.
[01:26:11.728 --> 01:26:20.251]  So I do find that people in government finally realize and understand something wicked this way comes.
[01:26:20.251 --> 01:26:23.293]  Yeah, you're right Alex, but I'll tell you what concerns me.
[01:26:23.293 --> 01:26:33.737]  It's that the good people that are in government, I think they're being driven out by the bad people.
[01:26:33.737 --> 01:26:37.579]  In other words, a decent person is born more bad people
[01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:40.169]  Gravitate towards the government.
[01:26:40.169 --> 01:26:43.013]  He doesn't want to be in that environment.
[01:26:43.013 --> 01:26:45.657]  It scares him with good reason.
[01:26:45.657 --> 01:26:50.663]  He wants to go out someplace else where he's not surrounded by criminal personalities.
[01:26:51.696 --> 01:26:53.718]  I mean, that's another reason why I think it's getting worse.
[01:26:53.718 --> 01:26:54.759]  I hate to be so negative.
[01:26:54.759 --> 01:26:56.980]  No, but we gotta be honest, and that's what founded America.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:07.929]  Talk about your philosophy, what made you come up with this international man idea that became really a sensation and still is today for a record number of expatriates and others.
[01:27:07.929 --> 01:27:12.733]  When did the worm turn for you, or were you always that way, Doug Casey?
[01:27:12.733 --> 01:27:16.416]  Well, you know, like yourself, I'm a libertarian.
[01:27:17.142 --> 01:27:23.766]  I believe in free minds and free markets, and I think I was born that way, quite frankly.
[01:27:23.766 --> 01:27:45.338]  It may be some type of a genetic mutation for all I know, but the thing is that all of our ancestors, all of us who are Americans, they all came here from foreign countries, and everybody, our ancestors came to America because
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:55.082]  They wanted to get away from being turned into slaves in different countries around the world.
[01:27:55.082 --> 01:27:57.782]  The problem is, is that the U.S.
[01:27:57.782 --> 01:28:09.505]  government, since it's going in the same direction as those governments that our ancestors ran away from, now we have to run away from, we have to go someplace else ourselves.
[01:28:09.505 --> 01:28:12.946]  We have to, like, find a new America someplace.
[01:28:14.272 --> 01:28:24.540]  But King George X knows we're running away, and so now our own government's creating a global government to try to capture everyone.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.981]  Yeah, it's right.
[01:28:25.981 --> 01:28:26.882]  That's right.
[01:28:26.882 --> 01:28:29.484]  Because we can try to run, but we can't hide.
[01:28:29.484 --> 01:28:43.776]  I mean, the fact that at this point it's very, very hard, almost impossible for an American to open up a foreign bank or brokerage account means that we're trapped like lobsters
[01:28:44.657 --> 01:28:46.639]  Uh, here in the United States.
[01:28:46.639 --> 01:28:53.223]  Now, of course, most Americans are going to say, I don't want to leave America, this is the greatest country in the world.
[01:28:53.223 --> 01:29:07.193]  And it certainly used to be, but you no longer even have the option of living somewhere else, because if you can't open up a foreign bank or brokerage account, how are you going to get your money out of the country?
[01:29:07.193 --> 01:29:12.397]  I mean, the various exits
[01:29:13.112 --> 01:29:18.156]  Possible exits, if you want to take advantage of them, are closing almost daily.
[01:29:18.156 --> 01:29:18.616]  You're right.
[01:29:18.616 --> 01:29:21.558]  Doug Casey, caseyresearch.com.
[01:29:21.558 --> 01:29:21.999]  Stay there.
[01:29:21.999 --> 01:29:28.684]  We're going to come back in the next segment and get into solutions and your prognosis for the future.
[01:29:28.684 --> 01:29:29.865]  What's wrong?
[01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:33.507]  You don't like a small group of psychos hijacking your country?
[01:29:33.507 --> 01:29:37.691]  Well, become President of the United States and change it from the
[01:29:39.818 --> 01:29:40.499]  Never mind.
[01:29:40.499 --> 01:29:45.767]  Three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:29:45.767 --> 01:29:49.512]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[01:29:49.512 --> 01:29:54.780]  On the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.812 --> 01:30:09.537]  Former DARPA Director and now Google Executive Regina Dugan will be attending the secretive 2015 Bilderberg Conference this year in Austria.
[01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:18.722]  Dugan, who is helping to develop and promote the idea of implantable microchips, will be there to head up the discussion on artificial intelligence.
[01:30:18.722 --> 01:30:23.144]  Regina Dugan is also an advocate for ingestible microchips.
[01:30:23.144 --> 01:30:26.486]  That's right, tiny microchips inside little pills.
[01:30:26.986 --> 01:30:43.373]  That users would swallow daily in order to obtain what Dugan describes as superpowers by having your entire body act as a biological authentication system for cell phones, cars, door locks, and other devices.
[01:30:43.373 --> 01:30:49.715]  And she is quick to point out that these microchip pills have already been approved by the FDA.
[01:30:49.715 --> 01:30:55.798]  For the complete list of this year's Bilderberg attendees, be sure to check out InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.627 --> 01:31:03.788]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[01:31:03.788 --> 01:31:11.110]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:19.192]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:31:19.192 --> 01:31:20.192]  The bad news is
[01:31:20.532 --> 01:31:28.196]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[01:31:28.196 --> 01:31:32.999]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[01:31:32.999 --> 01:31:40.362]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:43.264]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[01:31:43.484 --> 01:31:50.468]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[01:31:50.468 --> 01:31:54.470]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:58.382 --> 01:32:18.112]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:32:18.112 --> 01:32:18.532]  Well then,
[01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:22.937]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.479]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:32:24.479 --> 01:32:27.802]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:32:27.802 --> 01:32:32.928]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:32.928 --> 01:32:33.729]  It's always about support.
[01:32:33.729 --> 01:32:34.289]  I think so.
[01:33:05.519 --> 01:33:11.766]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.772 --> 01:33:40.957]  Well, I think this song from The Who says it all.
[01:33:52.637 --> 01:33:54.759]  Won't get fooled again, baby.
[01:33:54.759 --> 01:33:56.261]  Won't get fooled again.
[01:34:16.255 --> 01:34:20.056]  CaseyResearch.com, Doug Casey, we're going back to him here in just a moment.
[01:34:20.056 --> 01:34:38.299]  It has to be individual philosophy of liberty, voting with your dollars, promoting freedom, defending it staunchly, getting in the face of government or corporations or others that trample on those rights, or you will be usurped, you will be taken over, like a vacuum.
[01:34:38.299 --> 01:34:42.800]  You create a vacuum down at a hundred feet underwater, the water's going to figure out a way to get in there.
[01:34:44.355 --> 01:34:46.196]  Nature abhors a vacuum.
[01:34:46.196 --> 01:34:56.919]  And if you don't stand up and promote the principles of freedom, if you don't jealously guard that jewel, as Thomas Jefferson said, you will wake up homeless.
[01:34:56.919 --> 01:35:00.101]  On the continent, your forbearers conquered, to quote Thomas Jefferson yet again.
[01:35:00.101 --> 01:35:03.682]  I was quoting him earlier and didn't want to plagiarize.
[01:35:05.148 --> 01:35:06.869]  We are at that crossroads.
[01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:14.075]  In fact, we've already gotten to the crossroad and started going down the road to absolute serfdom, the road to total tyranny.
[01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:26.264]  We can still look back and see the fork, but if we go much further, if we go back, it's going to be overgrown and there's a rock slide in the way.
[01:35:26.264 --> 01:35:29.726]  That's what happens politically, societally, historically.
[01:35:29.726 --> 01:35:34.510]  We've almost reached the point of no return, and then there are avenues for us through the path we're going down.
[01:35:36.184 --> 01:35:57.237]  If we survive it, if pockets of freedom persist through the gates of hell that we're entering, Mordor, Hades, if we survive this trip across the river Styx from the death of freedom, I guess there could be some fiery phoenix on the other side that rises again.
[01:35:57.237 --> 01:35:59.698]  It'll probably make our metal that much stronger.
[01:35:59.698 --> 01:36:03.440]  It was great tyranny that caused our forebears to stand up in 1776.
[01:36:05.848 --> 01:36:25.325]  But they faced a financial tyranny, a military tyranny, not a cultural malaise, a diseased, filthy decadence, a soul-rotting collectivism, the welfare dole that was used to control citizens of Rome.
[01:36:26.394 --> 01:36:32.616]  There was not a big welfare system in King George's day except for those allied with the throne.
[01:36:32.616 --> 01:36:41.439]  There was not a general welfare system written in to be inverted to basically create a domesticated population.
[01:36:41.439 --> 01:36:45.021]  So we'll talk about the way out of this with Doug Casey in a moment.
[01:36:45.021 --> 01:36:48.562]  And if I use biblical and epic legendary terms,
[01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:51.886]  It's because we're in an epic time.
[01:36:51.886 --> 01:36:56.088]  I mean, they're on the news now saying everybody's going to get microchips to buy and sell.
[01:36:56.088 --> 01:36:58.610]  They're on the news announcing world government.
[01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:04.233]  They're on the news releasing GMO salmon in the ocean that they say will extinct the natural salmon.
[01:37:04.233 --> 01:37:09.736]  They're on the news just breaking down huge developments.
[01:37:09.736 --> 01:37:11.377]  And the elite are on a power trip.
[01:37:11.377 --> 01:37:12.598]  They think they're invincible.
[01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:14.959]  My God, we'll be lucky if any of us survive.
[01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:18.602]  Hitler thought he was invincible, Stalin, Lenin.
[01:37:18.602 --> 01:37:31.089]  I mean, there's hundreds of these guys and this elite is that much more megalomaniacal than even predecessors because the technology used by them is a double-edged sword.
[01:37:31.089 --> 01:37:36.232]  It just allows them to really have a lot of omnipresent powers.
[01:37:37.298 --> 01:37:40.740]  The problem is there's still humans using them.
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.561]  And that's what makes it that much more destructive.
[01:37:42.561 --> 01:37:48.244]  We'll talk about that with Doug Casey of caseyresearch.com in a moment, about crisis investing and more.
[01:37:48.244 --> 01:37:53.907]  But before we go any further, we have the nightly news here that's getting ready to launch on cable and TV very, very soon.
[01:37:53.907 --> 01:37:57.849]  I've just got so many projects on my plate, but it will be before the year ends, in fact, sooner.
[01:37:57.849 --> 01:37:59.510]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:37:59.510 --> 01:38:01.912]  New website designs, so much more.
[01:38:03.027 --> 01:38:04.810]  Some cable and TV systems already carry it.
[01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:06.732]  It's on seven o'clock central every night.
[01:38:06.732 --> 01:38:07.934]  Boxee Roku.
[01:38:07.934 --> 01:38:09.316]  You can watch on your cable.
[01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:12.420]  If you're a subscriber, $5.95 a month.
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.022]  Get three months free if you sign up for a year.
[01:38:14.022 --> 01:38:15.464]  It's even less expensive.
[01:38:15.464 --> 01:38:17.647]  Twenty people can use each membership.
[01:38:19.286 --> 01:38:22.909]  It's subscription, so, because we can't pay for the bandwidth if everybody used it.
[01:38:22.909 --> 01:38:25.230]  We've got a billion views on YouTube.
[01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:31.595]  But it is for members that want to see stuff on HD, see the nightly news, see all the films, read a bunch of e-books.
[01:38:31.595 --> 01:38:32.855]  Takes about a minute to sign up.
[01:38:32.855 --> 01:38:33.696]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:38:35.197 --> 01:38:39.219]  It's the same price it was when I started it 14, 15 years ago.
[01:38:39.219 --> 01:38:46.642]  PrisonPlanet.tv, but now 20 people can use each membership because the bandwidth has become more affordable.
[01:38:46.642 --> 01:38:47.683]  We can do that.
[01:38:47.683 --> 01:38:49.764]  So I want to thank you all that are members.
[01:38:49.764 --> 01:38:52.265]  If you're not a member, become a PrisonPlanet.tv member today.
[01:38:54.013 --> 01:39:16.203]  Also, we have really popular nutraceuticals from Survival Shield, X2 nascent iodine that so many people are deficient in, the cleanest form of iodine out there, to super male and super female vitality, to the oxy powder that flushes out the upper and lower intestines, to high quality colloidal silver, to DNA force, to organic Mediterranean well of oregano,
[01:39:17.343 --> 01:39:27.685]  To Secret 12, Methylcobalamin, highest quality, absorbable, organic, Vitamin B12, and so many other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:27.685 --> 01:39:40.287]  Then we've got the books, the films, the liberty-based apparel to spread the word and meet like-minded people at InfoWarsStore.com, that is the umbrella site that also houses MadeIn1776.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:44.377 --> 01:39:53.571]  Then, of course, we have the entire family of high-quality longevity products that you can get 10% discounts on, 30% discounts on, depending on if you decide to be a distributor.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:07.187]  You can get free shipping when you sign up for AutoShip at InfoWarsHealth.com on that entire family of amazing products, and that supports the broadcast as well, InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:40:07.187 --> 01:40:11.089]  Or InfoWarsTeam.com if you want to become a distributor, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:13.990]  Okay, Doug, I've been ranting here for five minutes.
[01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:15.331]  Thank you for holding during that.
[01:40:16.638 --> 01:40:23.804]  I know you don't ever want to come on and toot your own horn about your books, about your newsletters, about your invaluable research that's cutting edge.
[01:40:23.804 --> 01:40:30.830]  Tell us about some of the research materials you've got available for the public at KC Research.
[01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:42.660]  Talk about some of your books, and then get into what you're doing to get prepared, what you think this monster is that's coming down the road at us, this mad dog, and how you and others are getting prepared.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.500]  Why are the elites
[01:40:44.494 --> 01:40:49.936]  In the Guardian now, buying armored redoubts, underground bunkers, running to New Zealand.
[01:40:49.936 --> 01:40:56.679]  I mean, when the elite themselves are splitting the scene, they may have cooked this goose a little too much.
[01:40:56.679 --> 01:40:59.220]  May have killed the golden goose.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.401]  Doug Casey.
[01:41:01.401 --> 01:41:04.262]  Way to start, Alex.
[01:41:04.262 --> 01:41:10.185]  You know, one thing I was thinking about as you were talking earlier is the fact that
[01:41:11.517 --> 01:41:16.701]  Governments around the world at this point are trying to get rid of cash.
[01:41:16.701 --> 01:41:20.244]  In other words, paper currency.
[01:41:20.244 --> 01:41:28.910]  There's a movement on that since everybody has a cell phone today to
[01:41:30.894 --> 01:41:43.918]  Use the cell phone to obviate even credit cards, and certainly obviate cash, so that everything you buy or sell has to go through your bank account.
[01:41:43.918 --> 01:41:56.262]  At that point, the government knows exactly what you're doing, what you're buying and what you're selling, because there will be no cash anymore to even buy a candy bar, quite frankly.
[01:41:59.342 --> 01:42:08.988]  This is a very disturbing trend that's taken root just over the last year or two and is accelerating rapidly all over the world.
[01:42:08.988 --> 01:42:12.289]  But what do you do about that?
[01:42:12.289 --> 01:42:14.491]  One thing that you should do about it, I think, is...
[01:42:16.311 --> 01:42:22.814]  Buy, for your personal possession, gold and silver coins at this point.
[01:42:22.814 --> 01:42:35.379]  Gold and silver have been used as money throughout history for lots of good reasons, and they will continue to be used as money in the future.
[01:42:35.379 --> 01:42:44.023]  For the sake of your personal privacy, you want to own a lot of gold and silver, I think.
[01:42:44.023 --> 01:42:44.763]  It'll obviate.
[01:42:45.806 --> 01:42:53.452]  Uh, the government's efforts to make all money transfers electronic.
[01:42:53.452 --> 01:42:55.374]  So that's just a thought.
[01:42:55.374 --> 01:43:05.802]  And I'll point out right now that as we speak right now, both of those metals are once again in a very reasonable buying zone.
[01:43:05.802 --> 01:43:08.204]  Silver is about $16, gold is about $1,175 an ounce.
[01:43:13.044 --> 01:43:18.786]  I think the next step is up for both of them from this point forward.
[01:43:18.786 --> 01:43:29.771]  So I think that all of your listeners ought to have a significant stash of gold and silver coins put away in the safest place that they can think of.
[01:43:31.909 --> 01:43:34.411]  Well, that's one piece of advice that I'd recommend.
[01:43:34.411 --> 01:43:46.658]  And by the way, as you know, it's come out in the news, what you and others said years ago, the big central banks have been naked shorting gold and silver, artificially driving down its price, while they buy it and hoard it.
[01:43:46.658 --> 01:43:52.662]  Well, yeah, it's very problematical.
[01:43:54.424 --> 01:44:01.588]  In the world there are about 6 billion ounces of gold that have been mined since the dawn of history.
[01:44:01.588 --> 01:44:08.812]  We don't know exactly how many ounces of gold there are in the world, but the best estimates are about 6 billion ounces of gold.
[01:44:08.812 --> 01:44:13.155]  In other words, less than an ounce for every man, woman, and child in the country.
[01:44:13.795 --> 01:44:19.857]  So I think it's incumbent upon everybody to have at least an ounce of gold in their own possession.
[01:44:19.857 --> 01:44:26.619]  Better ten or twenty or a hundred or more ounces of gold in their possession.
[01:44:26.619 --> 01:44:33.482]  I think the price of gold is going up and the price of silver perhaps even more.
[01:44:33.482 --> 01:44:35.943]  So that's step number one.
[01:44:35.943 --> 01:44:39.604]  But step number two is because
[01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:46.062]  All of these governments are creating trillions of new currency units.
[01:44:46.062 --> 01:44:47.342]  This isn't just the U.S.
[01:44:47.342 --> 01:44:55.024]  government, starting with QE1 and QE2 and the bailouts and TARP and all this type of thing.
[01:44:55.024 --> 01:44:58.984]  But the Europeans are doing the same thing, the Japanese and the Chinese.
[01:44:58.984 --> 01:45:01.705]  So this is a worldwide phenomenon.
[01:45:01.705 --> 01:45:07.126]  And the next step, I think, is the Greater Depression gets worse.
[01:45:07.822 --> 01:45:11.965]  In the next few years, it's going to be much higher levels of inflation.
[01:45:11.965 --> 01:45:19.529]  It's going to be much worse than things were in 2008 and 2009, and also much different.
[01:45:19.529 --> 01:45:29.735]  But one of the advantages, I'm trying to look at the bright side of their destroying all these national currencies, is it's going to create more bubbles in the economy.
[01:45:29.735 --> 01:45:36.239]  And right now, as we speak, we're in the biggest financial bubble in history, and it's in the bond market.
[01:45:36.957 --> 01:45:49.024]  Interest rates have been driven down to zero, actually zero in some cases, which means the bond prices are at an all-time high.
[01:45:49.024 --> 01:45:56.048]  So I think the next step is that the bond market crashes, and that's much more serious than the stock market crashing.
[01:45:57.107 --> 01:45:59.609]  But it'll bring the stock market down, too.
[01:45:59.609 --> 01:46:05.594]  And it'll bring the real estate market down with it, quite possibly, because, unfortunately, in the U.S.
[01:46:05.594 --> 01:46:10.377]  and most of the Western world, real estate floats on a sea of debt.
[01:46:10.377 --> 01:46:21.105]  And if you can't borrow at reasonable interest rates, you really can't buy or sell real estate, because most houses have mortgages against them today.
[01:46:22.727 --> 01:46:43.058]  It's a serious problem, but it's a problem that presents opportunities, because although most people are going to lose most of what they have, it's going to be possible to capitalize on that, and as a speculator, to win from the unwinding of all these things.
[01:46:43.058 --> 01:46:48.221]  And people can specifically go to kcresearch.com and see some of the strategies you've been employing?
[01:46:49.062 --> 01:46:51.684]  Well, we have a lot of free publications.
[01:46:51.684 --> 01:46:56.587]  We have paid publications, too, that have specific stock recommendations.
[01:46:56.587 --> 01:47:11.076]  But in terms of general advice, we've got a huge amount of free information that I urge people to access, to start thinking about these things and start moving.
[01:47:11.076 --> 01:47:17.840]  Because, you know, the problem is that a lot of people that listen to you and, for that matter, listen to me,
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:22.564]  They think about these things, but they don't act.
[01:47:22.564 --> 01:47:26.808]  And I think the time is getting short for action.
[01:47:26.808 --> 01:47:29.150]  And what form of action should they take?
[01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:39.239]  Putting aside a significant amount of savings in precious metals is the first and most important thing.
[01:47:39.239 --> 01:47:42.943]  Second thing is, if you can, if you're in a financial position to do so,
[01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:52.591]  Diversify your assets internationally, so all of your wealth isn't under the control of just the US government.
[01:47:52.591 --> 01:48:00.952]  And three, would be to look for ways to capitalize on what they're doing.
[01:48:00.952 --> 01:48:05.273]  Speculations that will profit from all the money creation going on.
[01:48:05.273 --> 01:48:09.354]  So, you don't want to be a deer in the headlights.
[01:48:09.354 --> 01:48:10.614]  This is the time for action.
[01:48:11.943 --> 01:48:29.878]  Let's talk about deer in the headlights, because every financial expert out there says obviously the trillions in derivatives, the quadrillions, the velocity of money, the QE unlimited, the currency race to the bottom, what's happening with the bond markets, that it's a bubble that will pop
[01:48:30.498 --> 01:48:41.822]  And then it runs from bad to worse, but because of all their high frequency trading and plunge protection teams and other manipulations, they're able to build this bubble, I think, to a level never before seen.
[01:48:41.822 --> 01:48:44.963]  A, do you agree with that statement?
[01:48:44.963 --> 01:48:45.803]  Is it wrong?
[01:48:45.803 --> 01:48:49.364]  And how do you see this thing coming down?
[01:48:49.364 --> 01:48:52.285]  Yeah, in other words, what's going on right now?
[01:48:54.442 --> 01:49:01.566]  Is building up to something much bigger than what happened during the last depression from 1929 to 1946.
[01:49:01.566 --> 01:49:10.191]  It's much bigger, much more serious, and governments are much more powerful than they were back then.
[01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:16.435]  So, it's hold on to your hat time.
[01:49:16.435 --> 01:49:19.297]  And I think we're right at the edge of the precipice right now.
[01:49:21.656 --> 01:49:39.312]  But I don't think most people are even aware of that, because when you walk outside, the sun is shining, children are still playing, maybe the occasional cop is beating one with his nightstick, but you can go down to the Walmart and buy cheap goods.
[01:49:39.312 --> 01:49:47.399]  Everything looks pretty good on the surface, but I think it's a hologram that's about to be exposed at this point.
[01:49:49.491 --> 01:49:53.753]  And that's why the elite are digging into armored bunkers.
[01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.054]  What are they thinking is going to come?
[01:49:55.054 --> 01:50:04.980]  I mean, I know you talk to a lot of really wealthy people, but these are real entrepreneurs that actually go out and explore and mine and drill and build things.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:12.644]  They're not the parasite variety, but I know a lot of those folks that aren't parasites, they're also preparing escape plans as well.
[01:50:13.874 --> 01:50:18.358]  Well, so much of what goes on in the world today is financed by the U.S.
[01:50:18.358 --> 01:50:18.858]  government.
[01:50:18.858 --> 01:50:22.741]  In other words, yeah, you're quite correct about that.
[01:50:22.741 --> 01:50:25.303]  There is cause for optimism, of course.
[01:50:25.303 --> 01:50:28.966]  It's that there are two reasons why things...
[01:50:36.885 --> 01:50:38.226]  Let's end on a positive note.
[01:50:38.226 --> 01:50:38.846]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:50:38.846 --> 01:50:40.628]  Doug Casey, CaseyResearch.com.
[01:50:40.628 --> 01:50:42.209]  Let's come back and talk about the flip side.
[01:50:42.209 --> 01:50:44.290]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:46.872]  We've been talking about the problem and some of the solutions.
[01:50:46.872 --> 01:50:53.918]  But yeah, what are the optimistic, positive things with our final segment with Doug Casey, the legend, straight ahead.
[01:50:53.918 --> 01:50:56.160]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:58.971 --> 01:51:03.075]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.075 --> 01:51:06.257]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.257 --> 01:51:07.879]  Does that sound right to you?

[01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:34.171]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.171 --> 01:51:36.991]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:36.991 --> 01:51:39.292]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:43.794]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:51:59.028 --> 01:52:15.543]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:52:15.543 --> 01:52:19.026]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:52:19.326 --> 01:52:23.169]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.870]  Hdfirearms.com.

[01:54:22.611 --> 01:54:24.133]  Alright, final segment with Doug Casey.
[01:54:24.133 --> 01:54:32.021]  I'm going to get into economic news, world news, huge attacks on the Second Amendment, and more, and open the phones up in the third hour.
[01:54:32.021 --> 01:54:37.687]  We're also going to get another update and see if there's been some developments that may be taking place in Austria covering Bilderberg.
[01:54:37.687 --> 01:54:38.367]  But Doug Casey.
[01:54:39.068 --> 01:54:51.578]  Getting into the optimistic good things that are happening, despite corporate combines that work with government to basically freeze society in a new dark age, the renaissance continues.
[01:54:51.578 --> 01:54:55.441]  So go ahead and finish up with some positive notes, Doug Casey.
[01:54:55.441 --> 01:54:57.783]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:54:57.783 --> 01:55:04.428]  Two things actually are the main springs of human progress and cause for tremendous optimism.
[01:55:04.428 --> 01:55:07.451]  Number one, is that the average person
[01:55:08.231 --> 01:55:13.613]  Understand that he has to produce more than he consumes and save the difference.
[01:55:13.613 --> 01:55:15.254]  And that builds capital.
[01:55:15.254 --> 01:55:18.115]  The excess of production over consumption.
[01:55:18.115 --> 01:55:22.597]  And every individual knows he has to do that for his own life.
[01:55:22.597 --> 01:55:27.659]  And as you set that aside, that builds capital.
[01:55:27.659 --> 01:55:29.760]  Which allows civilization to progress.
[01:55:31.104 --> 01:55:34.346]  The second thing is science and technology.
[01:55:34.346 --> 01:55:43.671]  There are more scientists and engineers alive today than have lived in all of previous history put together.
[01:55:43.671 --> 01:55:50.415]  And they're inventing things, they're discovering things, and that's what really makes life better.
[01:55:50.415 --> 01:55:53.997]  And that ties in with the capital saved by average people because
[01:55:55.336 --> 01:55:59.819]  You need capital in order to do science and engineering.
[01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:10.606]  The problem is this, and how the government could destroy these two main springs of human progress, is that when the average guy saves, what does he save in?
[01:56:10.606 --> 01:56:13.248]  He saves in his currency.
[01:56:13.248 --> 01:56:14.309]  He saves in dollars.
[01:56:14.309 --> 01:56:22.374]  But what happens if the government destroys the national currency by inflating it?
[01:56:22.374 --> 01:56:23.375]  You wake up, you've got a
[01:56:25.177 --> 01:56:28.859]  $100,000 in the bank that you were planning on retiring on.
[01:56:28.859 --> 01:56:36.243]  That's $100,000 that's available for entrepreneurs to borrow or that you could invest in stocks and so forth.
[01:56:36.243 --> 01:56:44.328]  But if that money is destroyed, like a Zimbabwe dollar was destroyed a few years ago, that capital has vanished.
[01:56:44.328 --> 01:56:50.532]  Now your retirement is gone and the capital for the scientists and engineers is also gone.
[01:56:50.532 --> 01:56:51.673]  So it's a double whammy.
[01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:59.955]  And the force that's doing that is the government by inflating the currency.
[01:56:59.955 --> 01:57:05.639]  So there's cause for lots of optimism for the two reasons I mentioned.
[01:57:05.639 --> 01:57:09.481]  Savings and technological progress.
[01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:14.704]  But the state could destroy both of those things by destroying the value of the dollar.
[01:57:14.704 --> 01:57:18.927]  I hope I've been clear as to how that would work.
[01:57:18.927 --> 01:57:21.549]  So it's kind of a good news, bad news kind of thing.
[01:57:24.278 --> 01:57:27.321]  Well, Doug, I agree with you.
[01:57:27.321 --> 01:57:41.937]  I mean, I totally agree with you that this is going on, and I just hope the general public realizes that they're in great peril if they don't get involved in trying to basically inform others.
[01:57:42.618 --> 01:57:46.300]  But it almost seems like either somebody cares innately or they don't care.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:57.945]  I mean, I'm not really into predestination when it comes to my soul or when it comes to other things, but it does make you wonder why some people will not get involved promoting freedom even if their life depends on it.
[01:57:57.945 --> 01:58:02.727]  Like, I try to tell people that major shopping carts have cookies.
[01:58:02.727 --> 01:58:04.528]  They know whether you're a big spender.
[01:58:04.528 --> 01:58:06.969]  They know if you're a smart shopper.
[01:58:06.969 --> 01:58:09.310]  They will charge you more depending on your habits.
[01:58:10.953 --> 01:58:15.799]  I put a video out on that and a bunch of commenters said I was making it up, even though it was in mainstream news.
[01:58:15.799 --> 01:58:22.226]  I mean, it's like, there seems to be an inverse instinct to want to be cheated and screwed over.
[01:58:22.226 --> 01:58:26.331]  Maybe these people just don't want to believe they're being screwed over.
[01:58:26.331 --> 01:58:26.992]  It's just crazy.
[01:58:29.122 --> 01:58:34.027]  Well, I don't know where it's gonna end, Alex, but we're gonna find out the next couple of years.
[01:58:34.027 --> 01:58:34.388]  We are.
[01:58:34.388 --> 01:58:36.049]  Doug Casey, do five more minutes with us.
[01:58:36.049 --> 01:58:36.690]  I know you gotta go.
[01:58:36.690 --> 01:58:39.393]  I want you to finish up, back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:39.393 --> 01:58:40.854]  Short break, and then the third hour.
[01:58:40.854 --> 01:58:43.817]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.817 --> 01:58:45.900]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:54.023]  Alex Jones here with an InfoWarsLive.com consumer alert report.
[01:58:54.023 --> 01:59:01.348]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[01:59:01.348 --> 01:59:09.433]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:59:09.433 --> 01:59:10.414]  The bad news is
[01:59:10.754 --> 01:59:18.417]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:23.219]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[01:59:23.219 --> 01:59:30.582]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:30.582 --> 01:59:33.483]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[01:59:33.703 --> 01:59:40.686]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[01:59:40.686 --> 01:59:44.948]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:59:44.948 --> 01:59:47.489]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.778 --> 02:00:06.079]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.079 --> 02:00:07.860]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:09.621]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.621 --> 02:00:11.183]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.183 --> 02:00:12.744]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.744 --> 02:00:16.947]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.947 --> 02:00:21.010]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.359 --> 02:00:24.581]  Doug, you were trying to make a point as we hit that break.
[02:00:24.581 --> 02:00:26.422]  Again, tons of news coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:26.422 --> 02:00:30.024]  Doug Casey, Casey Research, is our guest.
[02:00:30.024 --> 02:00:34.827]  Doug, looking at this situation, finish up that point you were trying to make.
[02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:39.390]  And then I wanted to ask you, in closing, in your gut,
[02:00:40.487 --> 02:00:44.630]  I mean, promoting liberty for 40-something years, what do you think is going to end up happening to humanity?
[02:00:44.630 --> 02:00:58.739]  Because we could have government crazies and others make mistakes of the past, and then it would just be, you know, 100 million dead in World War II, or it'd be Mao Tse-Tung killing 84 million of his own people, because leftists and the CIA helped put him in power.
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:05.982]  But now with nuclear weapons and all the rest of it, I mean, these control freaks really could destroy everything.
[02:01:05.982 --> 02:01:14.044]  We've got a report on Infowars.com coming up in the next segment after you leave us, where Bilderberg is inviting Hillary's Chief of Staff to the event.
[02:01:14.044 --> 02:01:19.565]  She was at Bilderberg 2008.
[02:01:19.565 --> 02:01:22.726]  I mean, is this really the best the elite can give us, Doug Casey?
[02:01:24.497 --> 02:01:25.958]  I don't know, Alex.
[02:01:25.958 --> 02:01:31.763]  There's cause for optimism, but perhaps at this moment a lot more cause for pessimism.
[02:01:31.763 --> 02:01:35.847]  All I can tell you is what I do myself.
[02:01:35.847 --> 02:01:38.669]  You know, it's funny.
[02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:45.515]  I go on shows like yours, and I say these things, and I ask myself, why am I doing it?
[02:01:45.515 --> 02:01:46.335]  I'm a rich guy.
[02:01:46.335 --> 02:01:50.759]  I don't really have anything to gain.
[02:01:52.108 --> 02:02:04.135]  A publishing business where I talk about these things, but the risk-reward of saying things that run counter to the mainstream is getting a little bit out of whack.
[02:02:04.135 --> 02:02:08.258]  And I ask myself, why am I taking the risk to even say these things?
[02:02:08.258 --> 02:02:13.561]  And I guess the reason is, I actually believe in karma.
[02:02:13.561 --> 02:02:15.722]  What goes around comes around.
[02:02:15.722 --> 02:02:16.603]  And I think that
[02:02:17.674 --> 02:02:29.056]  If out of the people that are listening, only one or two people, something twigs in their mind and they start thinking and start investigating, it's a good karma thing.
[02:02:29.056 --> 02:02:39.558]  On the one hand, I believe in the French phrase, sauve qui peut, which means basically, let he who can save himself or every man for himself.
[02:02:39.558 --> 02:02:47.180]  But on the other hand, I really do believe in karma and trying to make people aware
[02:02:48.081 --> 02:02:54.186]  of the problems in the world today, so they're in a position to save themselves.
[02:02:54.186 --> 02:02:56.628]  I think things are going to get really grim.
[02:02:56.628 --> 02:03:01.092]  I think they're going to get really grisly over the next few years.
[02:03:01.092 --> 02:03:02.533]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[02:03:02.533 --> 02:03:15.504]  And I say these things, it's not particularly to my advantage, it's not even to your advantage to say these things, because it's pinning targets on our backs in today's world.
[02:03:17.998 --> 02:03:23.103]  Well, Doug, I mean, I can answer your question for you, so you don't know why you do it.
[02:03:23.103 --> 02:03:24.624]  I've psychoanalyzed myself.
[02:03:24.624 --> 02:03:27.807]  It's not that I'm some goody-two-shoes fake bleeding heart.
[02:03:27.807 --> 02:03:34.033]  They've got studies out that the fake bleeding hearts are six times more likely to actually rob from you or not to give in charity.
[02:03:34.033 --> 02:03:36.154]  There have been studies out of the University of Canada.
[02:03:37.075 --> 02:03:42.380]  That it's libertarians and then conservatives are the biggest givers to charity.
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:43.881]  And you want to take care of yourself.
[02:03:43.881 --> 02:03:46.743]  You want to help your friends and family by building them up.
[02:03:46.743 --> 02:03:49.346]  You want to teach them how to fish, not give them fish.
[02:03:50.632 --> 02:04:00.198]  And you have a feeling of connection and empathy and you want to build up humanity and you want to teach people what you've learned.
[02:04:00.198 --> 02:04:02.339]  You want to empower people.
[02:04:02.339 --> 02:04:07.742]  But these control freaks see other people empowered as a threat to them because they're so weak.
[02:04:07.742 --> 02:04:14.046]  Anybody who's a real leader, who's truly strong, wants to build up others because you're so confident.
[02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:14.686]  That's right.
[02:04:14.686 --> 02:04:18.088]  I like to be surrounded by other people that are
[02:04:23.517 --> 02:04:29.303]  I mean it makes my life better and richer and easier when I'm surrounded by people like that.
[02:04:29.303 --> 02:04:36.750]  And just as you said, it's the sociopaths of the world that want to bring everybody else down because it artificially makes them higher.
[02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:39.513]  And those are exactly the kind of people that are drawn to
[02:04:40.586 --> 02:04:41.967]  To the government today.
[02:04:41.967 --> 02:04:43.087]  It's very disturbing.
[02:04:43.087 --> 02:04:43.747]  Absolutely.
[02:04:43.747 --> 02:04:49.610]  Teamed up with select corporations to create a global monopoly under their control with a planetary cashless society.
[02:04:49.610 --> 02:04:51.011]  Powerful interview, Doug Casey.
[02:04:51.011 --> 02:04:52.211]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:52.211 --> 02:04:53.592]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:04:53.592 --> 02:04:55.252]  It's always a pleasure talking to you.
[02:04:55.252 --> 02:04:55.853]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:55.853 --> 02:04:56.333]  You're amazing.
[02:04:58.666 --> 02:05:01.808]  The film, The Magnificent Seven, is about to be remade.
[02:05:01.808 --> 02:05:05.091]  A story of a village oppressed by both banditos and federales.
[02:05:05.091 --> 02:05:11.215]  The villagers realized that until they were able to defend themselves, they would always be slaves and victims.
[02:05:11.215 --> 02:05:17.119]  So they hired professionals, not to be their protectors, but to teach them how to defend themselves.
[02:05:17.119 --> 02:05:21.842]  It's a timeless tale of the power of the community, of Posse Comitatus.
[02:05:21.842 --> 02:05:28.187]  Our founders knew that permanent standing armies would mean a permanent state of war abroad and tyranny at home.
[02:05:29.039 --> 02:05:35.724]  And as we've maintained the largest standing army in the world, we have had a permanent state of war.
[02:05:35.724 --> 02:05:42.190]  If our increasingly militarized domestic law enforcement were an army, it would be the fourth largest in the world.
[02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:49.896]  The concepts of a militia and a posse kept power in the hands of the people, to be led as needed by a few professionals.
[02:05:49.896 --> 02:05:55.560]  Until we reclaim that constitutional heritage, we will remain helpless peons.
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:57.562]  For FOWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[02:06:28.408 --> 02:06:29.409]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:29.409 --> 02:06:38.695]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:06:38.695 --> 02:06:42.498]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:06:58.328 --> 02:06:59.569]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:59.569 --> 02:07:04.551]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:04.551 --> 02:07:07.233]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:07.233 --> 02:07:14.276]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:14.276 --> 02:07:17.278]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:17.278 --> 02:07:20.219]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:20.219 --> 02:07:22.240]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.062]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:25.162 --> 02:07:30.884]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:30.884 --> 02:07:34.386]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:34.386 --> 02:07:37.487]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:37.487 --> 02:07:44.790]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:07:54.414 --> 02:07:55.756]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:55.756 --> 02:08:02.786]  We are on the march.
[02:08:02.786 --> 02:08:05.931]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:08:05.931 --> 02:08:09.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:29.696 --> 02:08:38.800]  I want to open the phones up to talk about Bilderberg 2015, the shadow government rats!
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:55.306]  In the middle of the Austrian Alps with 2,000 federal police running around, harassing the locals, harassing reporters, coming to our little lodge, getting in our people's faces, after they'd already interrogated them on the highway.
[02:08:55.306 --> 02:08:58.127]  The reason this is so important is they wanted to keep it a secret.
[02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:01.360]  We forced it out in the open.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:02.601]  They want their agendas secret.
[02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:04.082]  We're forcing those out in the open.
[02:09:04.082 --> 02:09:08.586]  Because then the EU, the TPP, all their agendas come to a screeching halt.
[02:09:08.586 --> 02:09:16.111]  There's a reason they try to keep it secret when Hillary and Obama went there in 2008 and then she stepped down two days later.
[02:09:16.111 --> 02:09:20.955]  There's a reason the Secret Service waved MP5HKs at us for no reason.
[02:09:20.955 --> 02:09:22.396]  Trying to intimidate us.
[02:09:22.396 --> 02:09:25.499]  Because they were told, get those people out of here!
[02:09:26.772 --> 02:09:38.309]  What happens if when Alex calls ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox and local newspapers, if the press shows up, we'll be caught secretly colluding?
[02:09:38.309 --> 02:09:39.630]  We stuck the reporters.
[02:09:42.661 --> 02:09:51.026]  150 of them on an airplane to go to Chicago in a pool saying that Obama was going there and slammed the door and shanghaied them.
[02:09:51.026 --> 02:09:53.727]  That's in my film, The Obama Deception.
[02:09:53.727 --> 02:09:54.628]  We ought to cue that up.
[02:09:54.628 --> 02:09:55.428]  I mean, I get breathless.
[02:09:55.428 --> 02:09:59.250]  I need to settle down to cover this.
[02:09:59.250 --> 02:10:04.914]  Because if we could have gotten the press to cover that, it would have been a major game changer.
[02:10:04.914 --> 02:10:06.875]  Hillary and Obama meeting in secret.
[02:10:08.049 --> 02:10:09.950]  Deciding who would step down.
[02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:13.673]  Hillary's chief advisor is now going to be at Bilderberg this week.
[02:10:13.673 --> 02:10:15.535]  Jeb Bush, guaranteed is going to be there.
[02:10:15.535 --> 02:10:16.976]  That's our intel.
[02:10:16.976 --> 02:10:21.239]  He just so happens to be in Austria, but says he won't attend.
[02:10:21.239 --> 02:10:24.562]  At least Rick Perry admitted he attended.
[02:10:24.562 --> 02:10:27.124]  Clinton lost his career going to Bilderberg.
[02:10:27.124 --> 02:10:28.585]  Tony Blair, countless others.
[02:10:30.009 --> 02:10:31.690]  The word is Obama went.
[02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:40.392]  In 2006, that's when they had a diplomatic car pull under an armored limousine and disgorge him and Hillary.
[02:10:40.392 --> 02:10:44.113]  The intel is that was his second visit there.
[02:10:44.113 --> 02:10:53.736]  Remember Tucker going, word is they've got that up-and-coming senator, Obama, whatever his name is, I don't even know who he was in 2006, word is he's in there too.
[02:10:53.736 --> 02:10:57.817]  And he wasn't even important enough then to hardly even mention.
[02:10:57.817 --> 02:10:59.298]  I'm not making fun of Jim, that's how he talked.
[02:11:00.279 --> 02:11:01.720]  I smoked Lucky's truck.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:03.800]  Filterless.
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.520]  He was a sweetheart.
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:05.681]  He died about a year and a half ago.
[02:11:05.681 --> 02:11:09.702]  It's weird when people like that die.
[02:11:09.702 --> 02:11:11.643]  You've known them forever and they're just gone.
[02:11:11.643 --> 02:11:14.424]  It's just sick.
[02:11:14.424 --> 02:11:21.026]  Henry Kissinger just keeps on going like an evil wind-up ghoul.
[02:11:21.026 --> 02:11:25.667]  Some kind of vampiric zombo.
[02:11:25.667 --> 02:11:27.388]  An old wart-covered white zombie.
[02:11:29.738 --> 02:11:32.320]  Bilderberg confab to discuss Iran's solution.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.043]  Curt Nemos writing on that.
[02:11:35.043 --> 02:11:38.846]  Bilderberg 2015, police harass reporter, search vehicle, visit hotel.
[02:11:38.846 --> 02:11:40.588]  We're going to play that video coming up.
[02:11:40.588 --> 02:11:45.112]  Bilderberg backs Hillary for 2016 presidency.
[02:11:45.112 --> 02:11:45.593]  I remember
[02:11:46.894 --> 02:11:55.862]  Calling Fox, calling CNN, because that was a story there just to show they wouldn't report going, hey I saw the Secret Service drive in a motorcade of 10 black SUVs.
[02:11:55.862 --> 02:11:57.604]  We've got sources inside.
[02:11:57.604 --> 02:11:59.446]  It's Hillary Clinton and Obama.
[02:11:59.446 --> 02:12:01.868]  The media for a day was saying, where are they in Virginia?
[02:12:01.868 --> 02:12:03.049]  They just disappeared.
[02:12:03.049 --> 02:12:06.693]  Had their cars at high speed, you know, running away from the media.
[02:12:06.693 --> 02:12:07.393]  Do you want to know?
[02:12:07.393 --> 02:12:09.916]  And they'd say, no, click.
[02:12:11.084 --> 02:12:12.484]  But guess who did show up?
[02:12:12.484 --> 02:12:15.625]  The Washington Times and the Epoch Times.
[02:12:15.625 --> 02:12:20.507]  And then Drudge linked to the Epoch Times.
[02:12:20.507 --> 02:12:22.147]  People ask, why is Drudge so popular?
[02:12:22.147 --> 02:12:28.169]  Because he'll link to important stuff that's alternative media and end up being proven right, just like we do.
[02:12:28.169 --> 02:12:32.270]  The mainstream media is dying because people know they're a bunch of Decepticons.
[02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:35.851]  I was watching, is it CBS or NBC, the Stephanopoulos
[02:12:36.909 --> 02:12:39.792]  Host of the morning show on ABC.
[02:12:39.792 --> 02:12:41.093]  I don't even know anymore.
[02:12:41.093 --> 02:12:41.754]  Yeah, it's ABC.
[02:12:41.754 --> 02:12:42.155]  That's right.
[02:12:42.155 --> 02:12:43.956]  I was gonna be on a stupid show.
[02:12:43.956 --> 02:12:51.644]  Then they claimed I didn't show up, but I was on the elliptical this morning at the gym and they had TVs on and I was watching them.
[02:12:52.577 --> 02:13:02.222]  And the fakeness of the reporters, the fakeness of the women, and the way they were looking at the camera, and just all of it was like predators, like wolves stalking prey.
[02:13:02.222 --> 02:13:04.924]  I mean, these people are so bad.
[02:13:04.924 --> 02:13:06.265]  They're so fake.
[02:13:06.265 --> 02:13:09.527]  They're not authentic.
[02:13:09.527 --> 02:13:19.032]  I'm just an American, a Texan, a person that loves freedom, really getting freaked out by the usurpation of my basic freedom.
[02:13:23.663 --> 02:13:26.784]  Here is George Stephanopoulos.
[02:13:26.784 --> 02:13:29.304]  Now I want to address some news you may have seen about me.
[02:13:29.304 --> 02:13:35.386]  Over the last several years, I've made substantial donations to dozens of charities, including the Clinton Global Foundation.
[02:13:35.386 --> 02:13:41.687]  Those donations were a matter of public record, but I should have made additional disclosures on air when we covered the foundation.
[02:13:41.687 --> 02:13:45.968]  And I now believe that directing personal donations to that foundation was a mistake.
[02:13:45.968 --> 02:13:51.790]  Even though I made them strictly to support work done to stop the spread of AIDS, help children, and protect the environment in poor countries,
[02:13:52.410 --> 02:13:56.514]  I should have gone the extra mile to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.
[02:13:56.514 --> 02:13:58.877]  I apologize to all of you for failing to do that.
[02:13:58.877 --> 02:14:03.121]  That is a sickening fake apology he made a few weeks ago.
[02:14:03.121 --> 02:14:08.967]  And the reason I bring it up is, the Clinton Foundation, I've been covering it for about five years, six years.
[02:14:08.967 --> 02:14:13.331]  How long ago did the whole earthquake in Haiti happen?
[02:14:13.331 --> 02:14:13.932]  Four or five years ago?
[02:14:17.025 --> 02:14:17.845]  Yeah, yeah, four years ago.
[02:14:17.845 --> 02:14:29.069]  I've been covering it since then because I just noticed that half the money people gave for little black kids, and the news was promoting it everywhere, was going to their private jets, hotels, and their institution.
[02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:34.130]  And then I began to notice that all these politicians and pundits were giving money to it.
[02:14:34.130 --> 02:14:38.572]  And then they would get jobs at it later, paid $10,000 a month, $20,000 a month, you name it.
[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:46.332]  So what it is, you give money tax-free and then it's like a mafia group.
[02:14:46.332 --> 02:14:53.556]  And then if you need a job later, they'll give you a job where you put your money in tax-free.
[02:14:53.556 --> 02:14:57.878]  So it is pretty sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:57.878 --> 02:15:00.239]  And these are not liberals, these are fascists.
[02:15:00.239 --> 02:15:04.281]  And I want to be clear, there are real liberals that are loving, that are caring.
[02:15:05.503 --> 02:15:16.427]  That really want equality, who really don't want gays persecuted, who really think it's a woman's right, you know, to have an abortion, who are misguided.
[02:15:16.427 --> 02:15:19.108]  And I'm not getting into the whole sexual persuasion thing.
[02:15:19.108 --> 02:15:23.830]  I'm saying there are a lot of really good liberals that are good people.
[02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:26.171]  Just like there are a lot of good conservatives.
[02:15:26.171 --> 02:15:33.614]  But when they get to following the leadership of their parties, they are turned over to pure evil.
[02:15:37.432 --> 02:15:38.493]  There's a headline right there.
[02:15:38.493 --> 02:15:43.175]  The Clintons had the most wasteful U.S.
[02:15:43.175 --> 02:15:44.276]  funded Haiti projects.
[02:15:44.276 --> 02:15:46.677]  Well, they're not designed to help anybody.
[02:15:46.677 --> 02:15:48.198]  They're payoffs.
[02:15:48.198 --> 02:15:52.881]  Where you pay your buddy to build a shelter, the shelter cost $10,000 and they get $100,000.
[02:15:52.881 --> 02:15:53.521]  It's money laundering.
[02:15:58.476 --> 02:16:05.720]  You put your money in the Clinton Foundation, and then it gives money to your company to have some work done, and pays you five times what it was worth.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:09.463]  It's a giant, criminal, mafia operation.
[02:16:09.463 --> 02:16:28.014]  Hillary Clinton gets money from third world dictators to her foundation when she was the head of the State Department, and then with the green light, weapons transfers, this was in the news last week, by the billions of dollars to those countries.
[02:16:32.076 --> 02:16:34.057]  And then it gets better.
[02:16:34.057 --> 02:16:35.177]  See, that's all Bilderberg is.
[02:16:35.177 --> 02:16:36.138]  Look at Prince Bernhardt.
[02:16:36.138 --> 02:16:38.258]  This is how sick he is.
[02:16:38.258 --> 02:16:48.863]  He wasn't as rich as his wife, the actual queen of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix, who just stepped down to make her son king two years ago and attends every Bilderberg.
[02:16:48.863 --> 02:16:53.764]  I've shot video, personally, twice of her going in.
[02:16:53.764 --> 02:16:54.825]  Just to get a flavor of this.
[02:16:59.787 --> 02:17:02.573]  And he had mistresses all over Europe.
[02:17:02.573 --> 02:17:07.142]  I mean, this was big Lockheed Martin scandals and payoffs to US defense contractors, you name it.
[02:17:07.142 --> 02:17:10.669]  But he was so greedy for money, he founded the World Wildlife Fund.
[02:17:15.655 --> 02:17:18.295]  Of course, sued the Wrestling Federation, take that name away.
[02:17:18.295 --> 02:17:21.836]  He founded it to run clandestine operations all over Africa.
[02:17:21.836 --> 02:17:23.396]  That later came out in the news.
[02:17:23.396 --> 02:17:37.319]  But then would also run the poaching operations to make sometimes tens of millions of dollars a month to him using WWF as the front to do the hunting.
[02:17:37.319 --> 02:17:42.140]  You can't make up how villainous these people are.
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:42.840]  You can look that up.
[02:17:45.635 --> 02:17:52.442]  And he was diverting the tens of millions just to mistresses in Paris and other areas.
[02:17:52.442 --> 02:17:54.745]  I mean, the highest end ones.
[02:17:54.745 --> 02:17:58.709]  He just paid for his women, because his wife wouldn't give him enough money.
[02:17:58.709 --> 02:18:01.752]  He's related to Prince Charles.
[02:18:01.752 --> 02:18:02.613]  He's good buddies.
[02:18:02.613 --> 02:18:04.675]  He died with Prince Philip.
[02:18:04.675 --> 02:18:05.716]  That's Prince Charles' dad.
[02:18:06.684 --> 02:18:10.805]  The guy that says he wants to come back as a virus to kill 80% of the world population?
[02:18:10.805 --> 02:18:11.825]  You can look that up.
[02:18:11.825 --> 02:18:22.528]  He told AP, Autobahn Society, that, and a bunch, he's quoted four times saying it in magazines, to the reporters, to call humanity.
[02:18:22.528 --> 02:18:27.249]  See, the British royalty is German royalty because their bloodlines died out about 300 years ago.
[02:18:28.871 --> 02:18:31.352]  And then those lines are actually Transylvanian.
[02:18:31.352 --> 02:18:42.394]  But the funny thing is, see, he was an SS officer, but then when Hitler started losing, they got the princelings out and had them flip sides over to the Dutch.
[02:18:42.394 --> 02:18:45.375]  And it's just hilarious, really.
[02:18:45.375 --> 02:18:54.136]  It's completely hilarious that when you give money to the World Wildlife Fund, it's a poaching organization set up by an SS officer.
[02:18:54.136 --> 02:18:56.657]  I mean, you can't make that stuff up.
[02:18:57.861 --> 02:19:09.264]  The Clintons, knowingly for more than a decade, fenced agitated blood out of Arkansas state prisons to be sold worldwide, filled with hepatitis and HIV, but it turned out Bayer wanted the blood.
[02:19:10.452 --> 02:19:14.953]  They would mix it with good blood up in Canada to sell it worldwide as Factor 8.
[02:19:14.953 --> 02:19:17.434]  And it turned out it was an initiative just to kill people.
[02:19:17.434 --> 02:19:18.695]  It came out in French court.
[02:19:18.695 --> 02:19:21.375]  They knew and said, all these people need to die anyway.
[02:19:21.375 --> 02:19:27.437]  See, these are villains that showing off around boardrooms, they go, you got tainted blood to kill some people?
[02:19:27.437 --> 02:19:31.059]  Yeah, we'll ship it out to you.
[02:19:31.059 --> 02:19:33.839]  We're liberal, did you hear?
[02:19:33.839 --> 02:19:35.160]  We want to help the children.
[02:19:37.643 --> 02:19:41.345]  I love being liberal.
[02:19:41.345 --> 02:19:46.508]  Never mind secret groups meeting in the Austrian Alps with 2,000 federal troops.
[02:19:46.508 --> 02:19:48.249]  There's nothing going on here.
[02:19:48.249 --> 02:19:49.410]  Turn in your guns.
[02:19:49.410 --> 02:19:50.690]  Government wants to help you.
[02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:51.991]  Take vaccines.
[02:19:51.991 --> 02:19:52.831]  Yes.
[02:19:52.831 --> 02:19:53.992]  Take the shots.
[02:19:53.992 --> 02:19:55.653]  Watch the baby convulse.
[02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:57.854]  That's what Daddy Lucifer loves.
[02:19:57.854 --> 02:19:58.595]  Yes.
[02:19:59.155 --> 02:20:00.996]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[02:20:00.996 --> 02:20:10.944]  All over America, people are suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeat, clogged arteries, and high cholesterol.
[02:20:10.944 --> 02:20:16.489]  Can you live your life free from sickness, pain, and fear, and experience your body healing itself?

[02:20:49.835 --> 02:20:50.836]  Distributor inquiries welcome.
[02:20:58.937 --> 02:21:04.102]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.
[02:21:04.102 --> 02:21:11.428]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[02:21:11.428 --> 02:21:19.535]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:21:19.535 --> 02:21:20.536]  The bad news is
[02:21:20.856 --> 02:21:28.518]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[02:21:28.518 --> 02:21:33.320]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:40.682]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[02:21:40.682 --> 02:21:43.583]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[02:21:43.803 --> 02:21:50.787]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[02:21:50.787 --> 02:21:54.789]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:21:59.017 --> 02:22:05.762]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:05.762 --> 02:22:10.146]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:10.146 --> 02:22:13.649]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:13.649 --> 02:22:14.790]  Not fun!
[02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:23.176]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:23.176 --> 02:22:27.940]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:29.441]  My name is Errol.
[02:22:29.441 --> 02:22:30.962]  I'm 74 years old.
[02:22:30.962 --> 02:22:33.544]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:41.390]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:41.390 --> 02:22:47.695]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:22:47.695 --> 02:22:48.196]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:24:16.334 --> 02:24:25.637]  On any issue you want to raise that we've brought up or any other question or comment you have, all I ask is that you have a good clean telephone and that you not be drunk.
[02:24:25.637 --> 02:24:26.257]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:30.538]  Here are some of the headlines we haven't really gotten into yet.
[02:24:30.538 --> 02:24:34.059]  Obama to circumvent Congress with a gag order on firearm coverage.
[02:24:34.059 --> 02:24:35.459]  It's been put in the Federal Register.
[02:24:35.459 --> 02:24:37.200]  That's where our edicts come from now.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:41.381]  Saying you have to get with the Federal Government and the State Department.
[02:24:42.992 --> 02:24:44.954]  On any discussion of guns, period.
[02:24:44.954 --> 02:24:47.195]  Not just technical stuff.
[02:24:47.195 --> 02:24:49.957]  And the NRA says this is the biggest attack on the First Amendment ever.
[02:24:49.957 --> 02:24:57.283]  Remember they banned Cody Wilson from putting up the design of a 3D printable gun online, even internationally.
[02:24:57.283 --> 02:25:00.786]  They claimed omnipresent total power.
[02:25:00.786 --> 02:25:07.171]  Continuing update, more school districts report chaos after white privilege theory influences discipline rules.
[02:25:08.154 --> 02:25:12.896]  And they go on and hype up racial division, and racial fights start, and there's problems.
[02:25:12.896 --> 02:25:24.322]  Just like 2020, to their credit, did a report back in 1997 about how once they started death education in high schools around the country, suicide tripled.
[02:25:25.543 --> 02:25:28.084]  Little girls never thought about suicide.
[02:25:28.084 --> 02:25:33.425]  Mainly little girls, but they would go and strangle themselves with their shoelaces just as they were taught not to do.
[02:25:33.425 --> 02:25:33.785]  The D.A.R.E.
[02:25:33.785 --> 02:25:43.468]  program ended up making kids use drugs because it showed you how to use it, told you about it, where to get it, what it was, created the incentive.
[02:25:43.468 --> 02:25:47.789]  It's like if my parents would tell me, whatever you do, don't get in this liquor cabinet and drink the whiskey.
[02:25:47.789 --> 02:25:50.330]  First thing I'd do as soon as they left was go try to drink the whiskey when I was 11.
[02:25:53.285 --> 02:25:56.547]  Of course, my parents didn't do that, but other kids that were told not to, they would.
[02:25:56.547 --> 02:25:58.568]  My parents would be like, you want to try this?
[02:25:58.568 --> 02:26:00.029]  Then I wouldn't want any.
[02:26:00.029 --> 02:26:07.032]  But my aunt gave me a plaque, it says, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper quietly to someone else.
[02:26:07.032 --> 02:26:13.416]  It's true, you'll talk right to them, sometimes they ignore you, but if you talk to someone like whispering, they suddenly listen to every word.
[02:26:13.416 --> 02:26:16.998]  My kids are pretty good, but the point is that
[02:26:18.609 --> 02:26:20.910]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:21.730]  800-259-9231.
[02:26:21.730 --> 02:26:27.973]  And notice it just gets more and more insane by the minute.
[02:26:27.973 --> 02:26:33.295]  I'm going to be going over that article more.
[02:26:33.295 --> 02:26:36.677]  It's really important.
[02:26:36.677 --> 02:26:37.417]  Oh, look at this.
[02:26:37.417 --> 02:26:41.759]  World leaders promise at G7 to phase out fossil fuels.
[02:26:41.759 --> 02:26:43.239]  Does anyone even believe that?
[02:26:43.239 --> 02:26:46.941]  They mean phase it out when you try to use fossil fuels and tax you more.
[02:26:48.288 --> 02:27:04.892]  Billionaire owner sees wealth gap fueling social unrest, and then the globalists call for more taxes on the middle class, the very thing that will actually destroy people being able to become wealthy, or even upwardly mobile.
[02:27:04.892 --> 02:27:10.574]  I mentioned this, Bilderberg backs Hillary for 2016 presidency, Chief Hillary Advisor to attend secret confab.
[02:27:11.479 --> 02:27:24.104]  The Bilderberg 2015 conference scheduled for talks taking place this weekend in Austria will focus at least in part on American elections according to a press release on the secret of Cabal's very limited public website.
[02:27:24.104 --> 02:27:29.446]  But then the media will come out and say we made that up even though Bilderberg admits it, which we forced them to do.
[02:27:29.446 --> 02:27:33.407]  The factoid appearing along with a list of attendees, one of which is Jim
[02:27:36.857 --> 02:27:42.159]  Messina of the Messina Group, who just happens to be Chief Advisor to Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:42.159 --> 02:27:49.601]  Messina also heads up the Super PAC, Priorities USA, which supported Obama and is now firmly in the Clinton camp.
[02:27:49.601 --> 02:27:54.603]  Messina also spearheaded Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012 and has just come back to the U.S.
[02:27:54.603 --> 02:27:56.804]  after leading a deeply unpopular U.K.
[02:27:56.804 --> 02:28:01.666]  election minister, David Cameron, to a surprise majority victory in British elections.
[02:28:01.666 --> 02:28:04.807]  That is an expert on making sure elections go the way they need them to.
[02:28:05.816 --> 02:28:11.138]  That he's been meeting Hillary's chief advisor?
[02:28:11.138 --> 02:28:17.680]  I'm sure that's not newsworthy with 2,000 federal troops guarding them.
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.460]  Nothing to see there.
[02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:25.322]  I mean, after all, they have American flags behind them on MSNBC.
[02:28:25.322 --> 02:28:27.063]  They must care about us.
[02:28:27.063 --> 02:28:31.144]  They're also pushing open borders, Bilderberg confab to discuss Iran's solution.
[02:28:32.605 --> 02:28:33.686]  You can go read their agenda.
[02:28:33.686 --> 02:28:37.710]  They admit that's just the cover agenda, but it's still bad enough.
[02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:40.553]  That's just some of the news we have on that front.
[02:28:40.553 --> 02:28:44.356]  But people are voting with their dollars, and that's why the globalists are so upset.
[02:28:44.356 --> 02:28:48.500]  AP reports McDonald's sales slump continues in May.
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:54.166]  Sales at locations open at 13 months, edge down another 0.3% last month.
[02:28:54.166 --> 02:28:56.008]  That's a plunge in one month.
[02:28:56.008 --> 02:28:57.129]  McDonald's sales slump.
[02:28:58.857 --> 02:29:03.941]  So people just aren't buying the GMO garbage like they used to.
[02:29:03.941 --> 02:29:08.944]  I guess there should just be a law to do something about that and try to stop it.
[02:29:08.944 --> 02:29:11.306]  Bad news on the Second Amendment front.
[02:29:11.306 --> 02:29:14.248]  Yeah, this new Supreme Court's come out, it's blackmailed and totally controlled.
[02:29:15.350 --> 02:29:19.452]  They've got whatever is going on in those closets ready to launch.
[02:29:19.452 --> 02:29:21.753]  I wonder if it's Hester type stuff.
[02:29:21.753 --> 02:29:25.974]  Supreme Court rejects NRA's challenge to San Francisco gun regulation.
[02:29:25.974 --> 02:29:33.998]  Regulation requires anyone who keeps a handgun at home must either store it in a locked container or disable it with a trigger lock.
[02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:36.198]  They're saying, yeah, you gotta make your gun useless.
[02:29:36.198 --> 02:29:37.059]  They agree with that.
[02:29:37.059 --> 02:29:41.361]  So a big strike against the Second Amendment.
[02:29:41.361 --> 02:29:42.161]  When we come back,
[02:29:43.470 --> 02:29:48.396]  Your calls and HD video of the police going after our reporters in Austria.
[02:29:48.396 --> 02:29:52.040]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.723]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.959 --> 02:29:59.579]  The U.S.
[02:29:59.579 --> 02:30:02.962]  now claims the Syrian government is working with ISIS.
[02:30:02.962 --> 02:30:04.243]  Officials at the U.S.
[02:30:04.243 --> 02:30:18.492]  Embassy Syria Twitter account accused the regime of aiding ISIS in the takeover of Aleppo this week, alleging President Assad has not only avoided engaging ISIS targets, but has actively attempted to bolster their position with airstrikes.
[02:30:18.792 --> 02:30:21.073]  Talk about a major shift in narrative.
[02:30:21.073 --> 02:30:30.435]  Since the beginning of Syria's so-called civil war, the Obama administration has funded and armed radical Islamists under the guise of supporting moderate rebels.
[02:30:30.435 --> 02:30:35.397]  Last February, the president even handed the Free Syrian Army the ability to order U.S.
[02:30:35.397 --> 02:30:36.017]  airstrikes.
[02:30:36.337 --> 02:30:45.905]  And one jihadist told Al Jazeera in 2013, FSA fighters regularly sell their weapons to ISIS once receiving shipments from the U.S.
[02:30:45.905 --> 02:30:47.126]  Well, that's when the U.S.
[02:30:47.126 --> 02:30:51.530]  isn't accidentally dropping weapons right in ISIS territory.
[02:30:51.530 --> 02:30:55.353]  So, who's really trying to bolster their position in Syria?
[02:30:55.353 --> 02:30:57.956]  Read the full story at InfoWars.com

[02:32:29.204 --> 02:32:38.210]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:42.293]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:32:54.464 --> 02:32:59.328]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:59.328 --> 02:33:04.153]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[02:33:07.057 --> 02:33:16.280]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:20.602]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[02:33:20.602 --> 02:33:25.224]  I'm not observing what they're doing in their own safety!
[02:33:25.224 --> 02:33:26.204]  I don't understand what's going on!
[02:33:26.204 --> 02:33:34.747]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[02:33:35.819 --> 02:33:43.301]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[02:33:43.301 --> 02:33:45.141]  I was telling you to ask such a question.
[02:33:45.141 --> 02:33:48.082]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:33:48.082 --> 02:33:55.164]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[02:33:55.164 --> 02:34:02.786]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:06.157]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[02:34:06.157 --> 02:34:07.519]  What I say, go.
[02:34:07.519 --> 02:34:08.360]  See?
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:12.606]  I'm the law around here.
[02:34:12.606 --> 02:34:14.768]  He came, he saw, he died.
[02:34:18.016 --> 02:34:24.481]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[02:34:24.481 --> 02:34:26.302]  You just have to be repetitive about this.
[02:34:26.302 --> 02:34:33.587]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:34:33.587 --> 02:34:35.988]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[02:34:35.988 --> 02:34:37.690]  You really don't have to trust me.
[02:34:37.690 --> 02:34:38.490]  You shouldn't trust me.
[02:34:38.490 --> 02:34:42.693]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[02:34:42.693 --> 02:34:46.676]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[02:34:47.717 --> 02:34:53.710]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:54.432]  Okay, Ms.
[02:34:54.432 --> 02:34:56.897]  Hughes, well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[02:34:58.872 --> 02:35:02.933]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:35:02.933 --> 02:35:05.674]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:05.674 --> 02:35:09.375]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[02:35:09.375 --> 02:35:23.059]  What we have happening here is a feeding frenzy of globalist corporate interest, allied with government that are destroying the free market while blaming it, and who are trying to fund internal sectarian and racial warfare.
[02:35:24.246 --> 02:35:30.392]  So that we're so busy hating each other, we can't ever get together and try to take back our society.
[02:35:30.392 --> 02:35:35.898]  But on InfoWars.com, there is a great graphic done by an amazing cartoonist.
[02:35:35.898 --> 02:35:40.783]  I'm having trouble reading exactly who did it, but it's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:40.783 --> 02:35:43.285]  It says, whoa, whoa!
[02:35:43.285 --> 02:35:44.747]  We need to see what's in your underwear.
[02:35:45.697 --> 02:35:50.501]  And it's a little what looks like six-year-old boy with his luggage and his shoes off.
[02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:52.924]  And Uncle Sam's a TSA inspector.
[02:35:52.924 --> 02:35:55.406]  Says government oversight.
[02:35:55.406 --> 02:36:04.234]  And there's a Wall Street banker with his underwear filled with cash, a backpack on, and a suitcase packed with cash.
[02:36:04.234 --> 02:36:06.817]  Says Wall Street bankers.
[02:36:06.817 --> 02:36:08.478]  And that's it.
[02:36:08.478 --> 02:36:10.140]  The police state's for us, not for them.
[02:36:11.135 --> 02:36:22.982]  Of course, he really should just have bags of cocaine that he's about to sell and money launder and jets full of children that have been kidnapped that they sell on the world market because that's what's come out the big banks actually really do.
[02:36:22.982 --> 02:36:23.882]  Again, look it up.
[02:36:23.882 --> 02:36:29.565]  You cannot make the magnitude of their evil up.
[02:36:29.565 --> 02:36:30.246]  You cannot do it.
[02:36:31.596 --> 02:36:41.944]  Now I want to go to Sharon, Michael, Herm, Susan, John, and others here in just a few minutes, but I want to air this HD report that the guys got uploaded.
[02:36:41.944 --> 02:36:49.930]  The story's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:52.833]  Police harass reporter, search vehicle, visit hotel.
[02:36:53.953 --> 02:37:08.881]  And this is just some of the footage you're going to see them uploading today and tomorrow as 2000 federal police descend up to six miles away from where the Bilderberg groups meeting to really get aggressive and really hate on people and tell them you can't go in the National Forest.
[02:37:08.881 --> 02:37:10.282]  You can't hike around here.
[02:37:10.282 --> 02:37:11.423]  You can't go any direction.
[02:37:11.423 --> 02:37:13.084]  Oh, you know, you came in.
[02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:17.871]  rented a lodge up here on the edge of the park.
[02:37:17.871 --> 02:37:19.111]  You can't come in.
[02:37:19.111 --> 02:37:21.712]  There's no proclamation in the newspaper saying you can.
[02:37:21.712 --> 02:37:22.753]  There's no rule.
[02:37:22.753 --> 02:37:24.894]  They haven't declared an exclusion zone.
[02:37:24.894 --> 02:37:32.717]  You're just going to get threatened by federal police if you do, because a bunch of criminals are meeting, deciding the world's fate.
[02:37:32.717 --> 02:37:35.258]  Well, guess what, Bilderberg?
[02:37:35.258 --> 02:37:38.900]  You got the EU set up and you got England and others to join it without a vote?
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:39.800]  That's all being reversed.
[02:37:42.090 --> 02:37:46.454]  You fool the public that the Federal Reserve is federal, now folks know it isn't.
[02:37:46.454 --> 02:37:57.602]  We're exposing you, the genies out of the bottle, and no matter how big a police state you push, or how much social engineering you push, you are not going to get away with what you've done.
[02:37:57.602 --> 02:38:04.367]  I'm going to play this, get to some phone calls, and then Google Exec behind ingestible ID chips to attend Bilderberg.
[02:38:04.367 --> 02:38:06.609]  I'm going to break down this article.
[02:38:06.609 --> 02:38:08.110]  The former head of DARPA is there.
[02:38:09.684 --> 02:38:13.951]  They think super technology, super science is going to let them dominate the world?
[02:38:13.951 --> 02:38:16.255]  They're wrong.
[02:38:16.255 --> 02:38:19.240]  Let's go ahead and go to this special report.
[02:38:20.549 --> 02:38:24.170]  Rob Dew, reporting for InfoWars.com, right outside Telfs, Australia.
[02:38:24.170 --> 02:38:31.973]  We're up the mountain a little bit from this small little hamlet, and you can look around and see the tranquility now, but that is not what is going on.
[02:38:31.973 --> 02:38:34.153]  It is a major police presence here.
[02:38:34.153 --> 02:38:36.774]  We've seen at least 50 cops already today.
[02:38:36.774 --> 02:38:40.535]  There's cops patrolling around me right now in this area.
[02:38:40.535 --> 02:38:44.436]  We hit a roadblock right at the base of the mountain, just outside the town.
[02:38:44.436 --> 02:38:46.537]  Here you go.
[02:38:46.537 --> 02:38:47.557]  Texas?
[02:38:47.557 --> 02:38:47.697]  Yeah.
[02:38:47.697 --> 02:38:49.438]  Is it tall paper?
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:54.061]  Uh... A rental agreement?
[02:38:54.061 --> 02:38:55.201]  Need to see your papers, please.
[02:38:55.201 --> 02:38:56.441]  Yeah, the papers for the car?
[02:38:56.441 --> 02:38:57.261]  Yeah.
[02:38:57.261 --> 02:38:59.022]  Uh, I'm guessing it means like... Oh, like that.
[02:38:59.022 --> 02:39:00.462]  Maybe that.
[02:39:00.462 --> 02:39:01.142]  That?
[02:39:01.142 --> 02:39:01.782]  What you need?
[02:39:01.782 --> 02:39:05.843]  Yeah.
[02:39:05.843 --> 02:39:06.784]  Is this the hotel?
[02:39:06.784 --> 02:39:08.404]  No, I don't think we're anywhere near it.
[02:39:08.404 --> 02:39:11.425]  Do you know how far the Buchan is?
[02:39:11.425 --> 02:39:11.985]  The hotel?
[02:39:11.985 --> 02:39:14.425]  Open the... What's that?
[02:39:14.425 --> 02:39:16.486]  Open the... Open the back?
[02:39:16.486 --> 02:39:17.726]  Oh, okay.
[02:39:17.726 --> 02:39:17.846]  Um...
[02:39:23.035 --> 02:39:24.416]  There might be a thing down there.
[02:39:24.416 --> 02:39:31.960]  Or it's one here.
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:33.021]  English?
[02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:36.483]  Yeah, I don't know how to... It's a riddle.
[02:39:36.483 --> 02:39:36.943]  It's a riddle.
[02:39:36.943 --> 02:39:40.865]  It might just be... Hit unlock and then there's probably a thing you just unlock.
[02:39:40.865 --> 02:39:41.425]  No?
[02:39:53.454 --> 02:39:54.375]  Okay.
[02:39:54.375 --> 02:39:56.896]  We were just pulled over and talked to the police.
[02:39:56.896 --> 02:40:04.160]  I showed a little bit in there, but then they told me to stop filming and I didn't want to mess around here just as we arrived.
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:07.942]  But, yeah, I don't think people were getting past here.
[02:40:07.942 --> 02:40:15.926]  We happened to get one of the last rooms at the place we're staying at up the hill, and we were not expecting a checkpoint so soon.
[02:40:15.926 --> 02:40:18.007]  I mean, we just pulled out of Telfs.
[02:40:19.449 --> 02:40:23.891]  And we saw the Ender-Halpin Hotel had an InfoWars bumper sticker on it.
[02:40:23.891 --> 02:40:30.233]  They wanted a passport, driver's license, they wanted to look in the car, they wanted to open the bag.
[02:40:30.233 --> 02:40:31.573]  Yep.
[02:40:31.573 --> 02:40:33.974]  They gave us the full money.
[02:40:33.974 --> 02:40:40.396]  But I don't think there's going to be much getting past these police here.
[02:40:41.300 --> 02:40:42.341]  That was crazy.
[02:40:42.341 --> 02:40:46.523]  Yeah, I'm not sure of the Austrian demeanor, but those people weren't messing around.
[02:40:46.523 --> 02:40:49.065]  They seemed pretty angry.
[02:40:49.065 --> 02:40:50.686]  Yeah, they wanted to know who the hell we were.
[02:40:50.686 --> 02:40:58.370]  You know, we came up here a couple days early to shoot some b-roll, get some R&R in before, you know, we're doing the intensity of Bilderberg.
[02:40:58.370 --> 02:40:59.751]  As you know, we've covered it for many years.
[02:40:59.751 --> 02:41:03.253]  We've never seen a police presence like this at all.
[02:41:03.253 --> 02:41:05.555]  It is totally unprecedented.
[02:41:05.555 --> 02:41:07.696]  We can't even get near the hotel at this point.
[02:41:07.696 --> 02:41:09.337]  The hotel is probably a mile and a half up
[02:41:10.288 --> 02:41:14.273]  Up the mountain that way and there's no way we're gonna get anywhere near it.
[02:41:14.273 --> 02:41:16.195]  I mean, there's just roadblock after roadblock.
[02:41:16.195 --> 02:41:24.965]  There's cops everywhere and I tell you I've never seen anything like it So we're gonna stay here as long as we can to give you the best coverage we can get
[02:41:25.625 --> 02:41:32.807]  And if for some reason we are kicked out of here, we'll relocate from outside the perimeter area and we'll continue to broadcast.
[02:41:32.807 --> 02:41:37.188]  So stay tuned to Infowars.com, Infowars.com forward slash show for the live feed.
[02:41:37.188 --> 02:41:43.129]  We're going to be on the show today talking with Alex about this because what I saw today completely freaked me out.
[02:41:43.129 --> 02:41:44.569]  We had cops surrounding our car.
[02:41:44.569 --> 02:41:46.390]  They had their hands on their guns.
[02:41:46.390 --> 02:41:51.811]  They were ready for anything and we're just a couple of guys, you know, with suitcases.
[02:41:51.811 --> 02:41:52.811]  Totally unprecedented.
[02:41:53.351 --> 02:41:53.832]  This is it.
[02:41:53.832 --> 02:41:55.793]  This is what it's going to be like in the New World Order.
[02:41:55.793 --> 02:42:00.838]  It's going to be police presence everywhere, protecting the elites, while you are treated like a slave and a serf.
[02:42:00.838 --> 02:42:02.259]  And then they tax you.
[02:42:02.259 --> 02:42:09.325]  And, man, even the car we're driving today has this, has a sensor built in so when the light turns red, the car turns off.
[02:42:09.325 --> 02:42:11.026]  And then it turns back on when it's green.
[02:42:11.026 --> 02:42:12.948]  I mean, totally crazy.
[02:42:12.948 --> 02:42:16.391]  That's the kind of world you're going to live in if these control freaks get in charge.
[02:42:16.391 --> 02:42:17.152]  So just remember that.
[02:42:18.888 --> 02:42:20.169]  Pray for us out here.
[02:42:20.169 --> 02:42:20.949]  We're doing our best.
[02:42:20.949 --> 02:42:22.990]  We're going to bring you more updates.
[02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:26.092]  Hopefully you've seen the footage now and it's freaked you out.
[02:42:26.092 --> 02:42:33.356]  But this has been Rob Dew reporting from just outside Telfs, Austria for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:42:33.356 --> 02:42:34.696]  Oh, you're at the checkpoint.
[02:42:34.696 --> 02:42:37.058]  Now we're going to take you and your family away.
[02:42:37.058 --> 02:42:43.901]  Just thank God we've got a Second Amendment.
[02:42:43.901 --> 02:42:47.063]  Oh, but they opened the borders up of Austria and let anybody in who wants to come in.
[02:42:48.558 --> 02:42:50.559]  That's okay.
[02:42:50.559 --> 02:42:57.280]  But if you're there to be a reporter and cover a legitimate story, you're trash.
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:07.803]  And I guarantee you, if they try to walk around on those public national park trails, down towards where the Bilderberg Hotel is, they will get arrested.
[02:43:07.803 --> 02:43:10.284]  And I'm not going to instruct them to do that.
[02:43:10.284 --> 02:43:17.186]  I personally got on a barge in England and did go through the blockade, but the police were smart and did not arrest me.
[02:43:18.356 --> 02:43:20.958]  I wanted to bullhorn up closer.
[02:43:20.958 --> 02:43:24.721]  They knew that it would have drawn more attention to the CONFAB.
[02:43:24.721 --> 02:43:29.946]  Plus, they, I talked to a bunch of them, did not like what was going on either.
[02:43:29.946 --> 02:43:36.492]  If you don't have an instinct to not like elites meeting in secret to decide your future, you deserve to be a slave.
[02:43:36.492 --> 02:43:41.996]  And I just don't know why the Austrians and the Germans have to follow the stereotype.
[02:43:41.996 --> 02:43:44.979]  The only, Turkey, they acted like that a little bit.
[02:43:44.979 --> 02:43:46.020]  Not, not quite as bad.
[02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:59.962]  They didn't act as hateful, the Turkish police, though they were scared and aggressive, and were following our camera people around like in a movie, and would be waiting outside their hotel room to follow us.
[02:43:59.962 --> 02:44:08.209]  We have footage of all that, but it's just mind-blowing.
[02:44:08.209 --> 02:44:11.693]  These are the people setting up the TPP.
[02:44:13.533 --> 02:44:15.354]  I've talked to reporters that are international reporters.
[02:44:15.354 --> 02:44:26.282]  They can go to Russia, which has not been friendly to the press, compared to a lot of other countries, and you can go to any of the big events, get in with a press pass, even if you disagree with them, you can cover events.
[02:44:26.282 --> 02:44:31.986]  Now, if it turns out you work for a Western NGO or George Soros, sometimes you get a bullet in the back of your head.
[02:44:31.986 --> 02:44:36.389]  And that's how much this whole thing has escalated now.
[02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:39.411]  But it's just crazy.
[02:44:39.411 --> 02:44:40.552]  Absolutely crazy.
[02:44:41.616 --> 02:44:42.797]  That we've now gotten to this point.
[02:44:42.797 --> 02:44:46.300]  Of course, the Russians claim that last reporter that got killed was killed in a false flag.
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:48.942]  They said, we're not going to kill that reporter.
[02:44:48.942 --> 02:44:52.585]  No one listens to your spy reporters.
[02:44:52.585 --> 02:44:54.046]  You know, nobody believes what they're saying.
[02:44:54.046 --> 02:44:55.947]  Why would we kill him and make him a victim?
[02:44:55.947 --> 02:44:58.469]  Your people killed that reporter.
[02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:59.190]  But I don't know.
[02:44:59.190 --> 02:45:02.533]  I mean, the Russians have been caught killing reporters before.
[02:45:02.533 --> 02:45:04.194]  My point is, this is what you see in Russia.
[02:45:08.775 --> 02:45:10.835]  And it's dangerous.
[02:45:10.835 --> 02:45:16.577]  It's out of control.
[02:45:16.577 --> 02:45:24.739]  And it's shameful that the criminals can have taxpayer money pay for them to keep their events secret and that the mainstream media would go along with this.
[02:45:24.739 --> 02:45:25.799]  Well, guess what?
[02:45:25.799 --> 02:45:30.660]  The mainstream media, because DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com are covering this.
[02:45:31.926 --> 02:45:33.367]  I haven't seen The Guardian do it yet.
[02:45:33.367 --> 02:45:34.927]  You guys Google Bilderberg.
[02:45:34.927 --> 02:45:36.048]  I haven't done it since yesterday.
[02:45:36.048 --> 02:45:37.528]  And click news.
[02:45:37.528 --> 02:45:39.149]  I've been doing it clicking web.
[02:45:39.149 --> 02:45:48.954]  All I saw was German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Austrian, Portuguese, Greek, Irish news.
[02:45:48.954 --> 02:45:50.154]  I didn't see any U.S.
[02:45:50.154 --> 02:45:50.674]  or U.K.
[02:45:50.674 --> 02:45:53.075]  news on Bilderberg.
[02:45:58.701 --> 02:46:03.987]  The Guardian just did a story, forget the G7, Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[02:46:03.987 --> 02:46:06.851]  And who wrote that?
[02:46:06.851 --> 02:46:07.972]  Charlie Skelton.
[02:46:07.972 --> 02:46:09.894]  Oh yeah, you were asking me who to get on from Bilderberg.
[02:46:09.894 --> 02:46:11.156]  Skelton's a perennial.
[02:46:11.156 --> 02:46:16.522]  We need to get him on, get Charlie Skelton once he gets out there on.
[02:46:16.522 --> 02:46:18.665]  We're the first that we know of to have people there.
[02:46:20.029 --> 02:46:25.994]  I wanted to get Watson there early, but he had a family event planned for six months, his brother's birthday, and his family came back in.
[02:46:25.994 --> 02:46:31.178]  Taxes are too high for them to live in the UK, his folks.
[02:46:31.178 --> 02:46:35.261]  So they've evacuated, but they come back and see him sometimes.
[02:46:35.261 --> 02:46:40.345]  I can see their sons that both live in London, separately.
[02:46:40.345 --> 02:46:42.306]  That's a great pair of reporters and writers right there.
[02:46:42.306 --> 02:46:44.248]  They've been with us now 13 years.
[02:46:44.248 --> 02:46:46.610]  Watson, Paul has, Steve for about 10 years.
[02:46:47.625 --> 02:46:50.387]  But I segue into your phone calls now.
[02:46:50.387 --> 02:46:53.148]  Michael in Texas, you're on the air, free-for-all.
[02:46:53.148 --> 02:46:55.569]  Go ahead.
[02:46:55.569 --> 02:47:00.852]  Hey Alex, I haven't seen you since the Fed demonstration just before the Kennedy 50th anniversary.
[02:47:00.852 --> 02:47:04.514]  That's right, protesting the private Federal Reserve, yeah.
[02:47:04.514 --> 02:47:11.338]  Yeah, I was there when McBreen pulled up in the getaway vehicle and met all you folks, so it was good seeing you.
[02:47:11.338 --> 02:47:14.299]  Hey, real quick, I'm in the telecommunications business.
[02:47:14.299 --> 02:47:15.300]  I work for Time Warner.
[02:47:16.303 --> 02:47:17.123]  Such a big company.
[02:47:17.123 --> 02:47:18.984]  I'm not worried about getting out of here.
[02:47:18.984 --> 02:47:27.348]  But it's so funny that the Comcast merger got canceled and the only other buyer for the company was Charter.
[02:47:27.348 --> 02:47:34.711]  And what a surprise that the premium that Charter is going to pay for the stock is way higher than Comcast was going to pay.
[02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:35.691]  And you say, wait a second.
[02:47:36.548 --> 02:47:43.454]  Economically, if there's only one buyer for the stock, for the company, how does the price go up?
[02:47:43.454 --> 02:47:55.605]  In other words, if the government says no, and you have all these regulatory blockades to the Comcast merger going through, well, that only leaves one buyer left, Charter.
[02:47:55.605 --> 02:47:58.027]  Well, then how does the price go up for the stock?
[02:47:58.027 --> 02:48:00.710]  These people knew from the beginning
[02:48:01.596 --> 02:48:03.437]  That they were going to do this.
[02:48:03.437 --> 02:48:14.105]  I don't know what the ultimate, you know, payout was going to be, but I know that the Chief Executive... Wait a minute, you're telling me between regulators and Major Fortune 100 that there's rigging?
[02:48:14.105 --> 02:48:16.507]  No.
[02:48:16.507 --> 02:48:17.788]  No.
[02:48:17.788 --> 02:48:24.413]  I mean, they now admit, for those that just tuned in, just the last month, stock market, interest rates, bonds, everything's rigged.
[02:48:24.413 --> 02:48:26.474]  Totally for the elite.
[02:48:26.474 --> 02:48:30.377]  It's all... It's worse than a cheesy Atlantic City casino.
[02:48:31.502 --> 02:48:32.202]  Yeah.
[02:48:32.202 --> 02:48:35.064]  And I wanted to talk about something that you bring up every once in a while.
[02:48:35.064 --> 02:48:43.527]  Being in the telecommunications industry since 1990, I was around when a certain law got passed.
[02:48:43.527 --> 02:48:48.590]  This was even before the Telecommunications Act in 96 came around.
[02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:54.712]  This was called CALEA, which means Communications Access for Law Enforcement Act.
[02:48:54.712 --> 02:48:57.453]  That was passed in 1994.
[02:48:57.453 --> 02:49:00.935]  And what it provided was foreign companies
[02:49:01.536 --> 02:49:13.442]  Who provide the box that enables American law enforcement to have access to do exactly what they're doing now, the snooping, reading all your emails.
[02:49:13.442 --> 02:49:19.425]  Yeah, mainly an Israeli company, total control of everything, and the capacity to spy on everyone as well.
[02:49:19.425 --> 02:49:27.029]  That's why the NSA is totally secret, and no one at the NSA is allowed to look at who's on the fiber, because it's actually a turnover of the U.S.
[02:49:28.445 --> 02:49:35.453]  And I'd be sitting there working with these Israeli companies in the middle of the night, and I'd say, well, wait a second.
[02:49:35.453 --> 02:49:48.147]  You folks can, via long distance, whatever the access they have, you can listen to, in other words, you have access to this same box that our law enforcement does, and we're supposed to believe
[02:49:48.907 --> 02:49:49.488]  We're good to go.
[02:49:59.707 --> 02:50:01.367]  Well, see, it's political correctness.
[02:50:01.367 --> 02:50:02.448]  It's political correctness.
[02:50:02.448 --> 02:50:08.249]  It's like the school could take the 11-year-old girls to a porn shop because it was progressive.
[02:50:08.249 --> 02:50:08.969]  It's the same thing.
[02:50:08.969 --> 02:50:15.451]  You're anti-Semitic if you don't want black boxes so foreign governments can spy on you hooked in.
[02:50:15.451 --> 02:50:20.232]  I don't care who it is, the UK, Israel, whatever, it shows how sick it is.
[02:50:20.232 --> 02:50:23.953]  And don't worry, Israel only has about 80% of the boxes in place.
[02:50:25.093 --> 02:50:30.557]  Chinese companies and others have been given access to that market and so is the UK.
[02:50:30.557 --> 02:50:34.460]  So basically we've been designed to be wide open and taken down.
[02:50:34.460 --> 02:50:37.563]  And I've had the former head of NSA Technical in here.
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:41.141]  Agreeing that it's a designed takedown.
[02:50:41.141 --> 02:50:41.841]  Do you understand?
[02:50:41.841 --> 02:50:47.123]  The CIA, the FBI, the NSA cannot look at who is on the NSA grid.
[02:50:47.123 --> 02:50:49.685]  It's designed to bring us down and destroy us.
[02:50:49.685 --> 02:50:51.565]  It is a takeover system.
[02:50:51.565 --> 02:50:57.248]  And the people pushing it in Congress are foreign agents publicly sworn to destroy the Republic.
[02:50:57.248 --> 02:50:57.668]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.033 --> 02:51:01.055]  What's your health worth to you?
[02:51:01.055 --> 02:51:06.561]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older.
[02:51:06.561 --> 02:51:11.126]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[02:51:11.126 --> 02:51:14.470]  That's never been the way Supernatural Silver has chosen to do business.
[02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:20.013]  Long ago, we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic silver.
[02:51:20.013 --> 02:51:26.618]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective.
[02:51:26.618 --> 02:51:31.501]  Some might call us a premium product, but we simply strive to be a product that worked.
[02:51:31.501 --> 02:51:39.186]  Supernatural silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungus, but safe enough to be used internally or topically.
[02:51:39.426 --> 02:51:46.531]  And it's powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.
[02:51:46.531 --> 02:51:53.616]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off your order.
[02:51:53.616 --> 02:51:58.099]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[02:51:58.579 --> 02:52:15.085]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:52:15.085 --> 02:52:18.566]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:52:18.866 --> 02:52:22.731]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:52:22.731 --> 02:52:24.432]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:52:24.432 --> 02:52:27.756]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:52:27.756 --> 02:52:32.842]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:52:32.842 --> 02:52:33.763]  It's always about security.
[02:52:33.803 --> 02:52:34.263]  I think so.
[02:52:58.021 --> 02:53:00.123]  Not available in California, Louisiana, and Virginia.
[02:53:23.459 --> 02:53:30.206]  This area has a huge demand for fresh healthy organic snacks on the go and that's exactly what you'll be selling with your fresh healthy vending machines.
[02:53:30.206 --> 02:53:34.511]  We've already identified prime high traffic locations that are perfect for healthy vending machines.
[02:53:34.511 --> 02:53:39.376]  Now we just need the right people to join our franchise network and help fresh healthy vending continue to boom.
[02:53:39.376 --> 02:53:42.539]  If this sounds like you, go to readyforfresh.com today and enter
[02:53:42.679 --> 02:53:42.999]  We're good.
[02:54:00.022 --> 02:54:06.009]  All right, we got a little six-minute segment here.
[02:54:06.009 --> 02:54:09.274]  I'll do the customary five minutes overdrive to finish up some of the calls.
[02:54:09.274 --> 02:54:12.999]  Herm, Susan, John, Sharon, Ron, we'll get to all of you.
[02:54:14.221 --> 02:54:23.924]  Briefly, one of our most popular nutraceuticals, survival shield, nascent iodine, super pure iodine, X2.
[02:54:23.924 --> 02:54:28.025]  I came in this morning and they had sold out on the website.
[02:54:28.025 --> 02:54:29.105]  And I said, so it's sold out.
[02:54:29.105 --> 02:54:32.286]  And Wellness said, no, we got like 200 something bottles.
[02:54:32.286 --> 02:54:33.226]  I was just holding back.
[02:54:33.226 --> 02:54:36.367]  And I said, no, I know we're getting a smaller shipment in soon.
[02:54:36.367 --> 02:54:40.308]  And then that may be it for a while because we can't secure more of the crystals it looks like.
[02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:44.632]  For at least a while, I said, put them up to sell them.
[02:54:44.632 --> 02:54:46.413]  Well, they're almost sold out.
[02:54:46.413 --> 02:54:47.454]  Thank you for your support.
[02:54:47.454 --> 02:54:49.095]  That's how we fund the operation.
[02:54:49.095 --> 02:54:55.078]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:55.078 --> 02:55:01.702]  When it does sell out, we'll put a box up there to put your email in if you want to be contacted first when it comes back in.
[02:55:01.702 --> 02:55:04.144]  Again, I never knew this would be such a popular product.
[02:55:05.304 --> 02:55:11.750]  And it is proprietary to try to get even clean iodine from the ocean, much less a deep earth source.
[02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:14.852]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:14.852 --> 02:55:20.757]  Herm in Louisiana, go ahead.
[02:55:20.757 --> 02:55:25.921]  Called you previously, my real name is Christian, but I found Herm is easier with my nickname.
[02:55:25.921 --> 02:55:27.122]  Okay, well, Herm, that's great.
[02:55:27.122 --> 02:55:27.662]  You're on the air.
[02:55:27.662 --> 02:55:28.183]  God bless you.
[02:55:28.183 --> 02:55:28.463]  Go ahead.
[02:55:30.157 --> 02:55:31.539]  God bless you, sir.
[02:55:31.539 --> 02:55:36.046]  You don't want to hear it, but you woke me up a long time ago when I was living near you in Austin.
[02:55:36.046 --> 02:55:37.669]  I've moved back home to Louisiana.
[02:55:37.669 --> 02:55:41.515]  I'm sharing all the wonderful information.
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:52.467]  You know, you've given, but I know we're short on time, so I want to speak about the book of Enoch and the trumpets, and how the trumpet is really connected to the Jubilee.
[02:55:52.467 --> 02:55:59.131]  And that's something that Jonathan Cahn, Rabbi Jonathan Cahn talks about, and people are interested.
[02:55:59.131 --> 02:56:01.233]  No, I know, he's got a best-selling book out.
[02:56:01.733 --> 02:56:16.583]  Saying the blood moons, I've only read synopsis, and the trumpets are going to start, and now they're hearing these giant trumpets in North America, towards the north, and in the UK, and it's even on TV, like, huge trumpet sounds that are heard for thousands of miles, and it's pretty scary.
[02:56:16.583 --> 02:56:19.065]  Might be some atmospheric, might be harp.
[02:56:19.065 --> 02:56:20.666]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:56:20.666 --> 02:56:22.767]  But a lot of biblical stuff's happening.
[02:56:22.767 --> 02:56:23.548]  What do you think it is?
[02:56:24.861 --> 02:56:39.368]  Well, I, you know, I wrote an article called, uh, Strange Trumpet-Like Sounds, Harp, CERN, Angels, or something else, and, uh, harp, I mean, I think, uh, I'm unclear, but I'm on, um, because I was told harp was, uh, being shut down due to lack of funding.
[02:56:39.368 --> 02:56:44.051]  The Air Force was, uh, in 2013, but... Yeah, no, they've got harp centers all over the world.
[02:56:45.199 --> 02:56:49.262]  But is it not true that DARPA took over DARPA now?
[02:56:49.262 --> 02:56:50.684]  Is that possible?
[02:56:50.684 --> 02:56:52.525]  DARPA has always been over it.
[02:56:52.525 --> 02:56:54.887]  It's just the Air Force was in charge.
[02:56:54.887 --> 02:56:55.588]  Here's the headline.
[02:56:55.588 --> 02:56:58.610]  Google exec behind ingestible ID chip to attend Vilderberg.
[02:56:58.610 --> 02:57:03.935]  Former DARPA director Regina Duggan to address artificial intelligence with global power brokers.
[02:57:03.935 --> 02:57:04.956]  And you look at this woman, man.
[02:57:04.956 --> 02:57:06.197]  She looks like a villain.
[02:57:06.197 --> 02:57:08.199]  She looks like an android.
[02:57:08.199 --> 02:57:09.920]  Ex machina, or however you say it.
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:10.841]  Machina, how do you say that?
[02:57:12.085 --> 02:57:13.687]  Ex Machina?
[02:57:13.687 --> 02:57:14.627]  Machina.
[02:57:14.627 --> 02:57:16.910]  Machi Machina?
[02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:18.511]  How do you say it, CJ?
[02:57:18.511 --> 02:57:19.952]  Ex Machina.
[02:57:19.952 --> 02:57:22.875]  Ex Machina.
[02:57:22.875 --> 02:57:24.276]  Mano Padacuco!
[02:57:24.276 --> 02:57:25.257]  Well, God bless you, Herm.
[02:57:25.257 --> 02:57:26.358]  Good to hear from you.
[02:57:26.358 --> 02:57:27.139]  Who knows, man?
[02:57:27.139 --> 02:57:29.661]  We're living on a planet in the middle of deep space.
[02:57:29.661 --> 02:57:32.324]  All this craziness is going on.
[02:57:32.324 --> 02:57:35.026]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sharon in Arizona, then John and others.
[02:57:35.026 --> 02:57:36.748]  Sharon, you're our telegunner in this segment.
[02:57:38.442 --> 02:57:39.583]  Hello.
[02:57:39.583 --> 02:57:43.586]  Hello, welcome to our broadcast.
[02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:48.349]  Hi, I'm 68-year-old Grandma in Phoenix, and I've been listening to you since 2012.
[02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:49.170]  Welcome.
[02:57:49.170 --> 02:57:50.931]  This is my first time calling.
[02:57:50.931 --> 02:57:52.212]  I didn't have your email.
[02:57:52.212 --> 02:57:53.093]  I'd like to get that.
[02:57:53.093 --> 02:58:02.720]  But a week ago, this past Saturday, when reviewing my morning mail, I came across a very disconcerting one from Drugs.com, I think.
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:06.063]  A message inviting me to participate in an amputee support group.
[02:58:06.716 --> 02:58:15.343]  I became a bilateral entity back in 1998 as a result of an adverse effect from a migraine medication versus an accident of public record.
[02:58:15.343 --> 02:58:16.364]  Sure, sure.
[02:58:16.364 --> 02:58:21.148]  I'm having a little trouble understanding because of your phone connection, but you're saying... Explain to me what you're saying?
[02:58:22.469 --> 02:58:31.052]  I got an invitation in the mail from drugs.com on my morning mail, and enjoining me to participate in an amputee support group.
[02:58:31.052 --> 02:58:32.632]  Alright, when we come back, I'm going to go to you.
[02:58:32.632 --> 02:58:33.773]  I'm going to come back.
[02:58:33.773 --> 02:58:35.093]  Don't hang up.
[02:58:35.093 --> 02:58:37.234]  People want you to be part of a support group.
[02:58:37.234 --> 02:58:39.855]  What they're probably really doing is tracking people that have been customers of it.
[02:58:39.855 --> 02:58:43.236]  Let me tell you folks, Big Brother is moving.
[02:58:43.236 --> 02:58:45.056]  Something wicked this way comes.
[02:58:48.737 --> 02:59:05.408]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:59:05.408 --> 02:59:08.910]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:59:09.250 --> 02:59:13.155]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:59:13.155 --> 02:59:14.857]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:59:14.857 --> 02:59:18.160]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:23.286]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:59:23.286 --> 02:59:23.987]  It's always about
[02:59:24.187 --> 02:59:24.567]  Thank you.
[02:59:51.201 --> 03:00:01.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.432 --> 03:00:08.059]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.059 --> 03:00:11.042]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.117 --> 03:00:19.938]  We're back live, taking your phone calls.
[03:00:19.938 --> 03:00:22.259]  Sharon, so you got something in the mail.
[03:00:22.259 --> 03:00:28.562]  I think I made out that you had used a drug, a prescription drug, so they sent you something in the mail about being part of a support group.
[03:00:28.562 --> 03:00:29.522]  Did I hear that?
[03:00:29.522 --> 03:00:33.084]  No, back in, prior to that, no, I didn't use any drug.
[03:00:33.084 --> 03:00:35.685]  I used the library medication back before 1998.
[03:00:37.706 --> 03:00:39.327]  As a result of migraines.
[03:00:39.327 --> 03:00:43.309]  And I lost my legs as a result of that medication back then.
[03:00:43.309 --> 03:00:44.890]  So it wasn't a public record thing.
[03:00:44.890 --> 03:00:46.851]  It was a medication thing.
[03:00:46.851 --> 03:00:55.076]  And they said that I got this thing because I subscribed to Drugs.com, which I don't.
[03:00:55.076 --> 03:01:04.101]  And I was prompted to share this with you because when I was listening to your show last week with Senator Paul on the floor and somebody, you know, he said,
[03:01:04.542 --> 03:01:09.524]  He's saying, you know, they're watching you, and people are saying, I think Mark Rubio thinks it's absolutely not true.
[03:01:09.524 --> 03:01:11.065]  Well, it absolutely is true.
[03:01:11.065 --> 03:01:11.926]  Well, yes, ma'am.
[03:01:11.926 --> 03:01:20.630]  Under Obamacare, it basically makes all of your health records available to any corporation that wants to buy them, and then they sell that as per... Anything that has...
[03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:24.172]  Anything I have to do with my leg goes back 16 years.
[03:01:24.172 --> 03:01:24.392]  Period.
[03:01:24.392 --> 03:01:25.233]  I don't do anything about it.
[03:01:25.233 --> 03:01:32.237]  Ma'am, they're now getting into people's juvenile records and taking their guns when they're 60 years old for juvenile crimes outside of law.
[03:01:32.237 --> 03:01:34.218]  They are data mining everything.
[03:01:34.218 --> 03:01:39.641]  They are digitizing it all because the AI wants to go back in time and wants more data.
[03:01:39.641 --> 03:01:40.042]  I hear you.
[03:01:40.042 --> 03:01:41.182]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[03:01:41.182 --> 03:01:41.863]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:41.863 --> 03:01:43.183]  God bless you.
[03:01:43.183 --> 03:01:45.305]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in California.
[03:01:46.303 --> 03:01:50.346]  I can walk around as press in California, but not in Austria.
[03:01:50.346 --> 03:01:51.046]  Go ahead, John.
[03:01:51.046 --> 03:01:53.648]  Hi, Alex.
[03:01:53.648 --> 03:01:55.149]  How are you doing today?
[03:01:55.149 --> 03:01:57.510]  I'm doing well in the home line, there.
[03:01:57.510 --> 03:01:59.712]  Yeah, well, good.
[03:01:59.712 --> 03:02:00.372]  God bless you, brother.
[03:02:00.372 --> 03:02:02.814]  God bless you.
[03:02:02.814 --> 03:02:09.478]  I wanted to tell you thank you so much for your extreme passion for the truth.
[03:02:09.478 --> 03:02:12.300]  And the reason I was calling was
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:17.563]  Well, a couple of weeks ago you had a show and you asked people to call in in regards to it.
[03:02:17.563 --> 03:02:21.565]  And this was, this has been the last, oh I don't know, six years.
[03:02:21.565 --> 03:02:29.751]  This slow build up of feeling something bad is upon us that I can't get away from.
[03:02:29.751 --> 03:02:33.513]  And it's just, it got me to the point where I was, I'm just almost a nervous wreck.
[03:02:33.513 --> 03:02:34.754]  It's the end of free will.
[03:02:35.982 --> 03:02:40.705]  It's nanotech and the food, it's World War III, it's insane elites.
[03:02:40.705 --> 03:02:46.730]  We all pick up that people that really have bad will towards us are in control now.
[03:02:46.730 --> 03:02:51.313]  And it's been giving me this feeling of just impending doom.
[03:02:51.313 --> 03:02:55.456]  And I keep watching what's going on, I'm looking at the media, and I get bits and pieces.
[03:02:55.456 --> 03:02:59.459]  But instead, because I don't trust our media either because they're all a bunch of puppets.
[03:03:01.932 --> 03:03:07.295]  I go to the internet and find what I'm looking for and the answers to the questions that I have.
[03:03:07.295 --> 03:03:09.377]  And I stumbled across you.
[03:03:09.377 --> 03:03:11.738]  It's been about two months ago.
[03:03:11.738 --> 03:03:15.100]  And I've been an everyday watcher since.
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:16.041]  I love your show.
[03:03:16.041 --> 03:03:17.242]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[03:03:17.242 --> 03:03:19.703]  No, please don't thank me, brother.
[03:03:19.703 --> 03:03:21.384]  We're all in this together.
[03:03:21.384 --> 03:03:24.066]  I mean, listen, I know these people are evil.
[03:03:24.066 --> 03:03:25.067]  I know they're coming after me.
[03:03:25.067 --> 03:03:27.448]  I need to wake you up so together we can beat them.
[03:03:27.448 --> 03:03:30.070]  But they want to divide us because... Yeah, go ahead.
[03:03:32.098 --> 03:03:33.078]  You're exactly right.
[03:03:33.078 --> 03:03:33.819]  It's everybody.
[03:03:33.819 --> 03:03:36.800]  This whole country needs to wake up.
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:39.221]  This is a feeding frenzy by the globalists.
[03:03:39.221 --> 03:03:40.401]  There's no joke about it.
[03:03:40.401 --> 03:03:41.541]  They're making their move.
[03:03:41.541 --> 03:03:42.202]  They're committed.
[03:03:42.202 --> 03:03:43.822]  We are being assaulted.
[03:03:43.822 --> 03:03:45.003]  They're not backing down.
[03:03:45.003 --> 03:03:48.204]  It's toe-toe combat with eugenicist crazies.
[03:03:48.204 --> 03:03:48.804]  God bless you.
[03:03:48.804 --> 03:03:49.384]  Got to jump.
[03:03:49.384 --> 03:03:50.324]  Great call.
[03:03:50.324 --> 03:03:52.385]  Susan in California, sorry to Ron.
[03:03:52.385 --> 03:03:54.306]  Susan, you will be the tail gunner today.
[03:03:54.306 --> 03:03:55.286]  I'm glad we got you.
[03:03:55.286 --> 03:03:57.027]  He says you're pro-goat.
[03:03:57.027 --> 03:03:57.627]  I want to hear about that.
[03:03:59.181 --> 03:04:03.025]  Yes, hi Alex, thank you for taking my call and I also wanted to give you an update.
[03:04:03.025 --> 03:04:09.731]  I actually have Gingy Freeman here with me and she'd like to give you an update on what we're doing with our city here in Visalia, California.
[03:04:09.731 --> 03:04:11.473]  This is Gingy.
[03:04:11.473 --> 03:04:12.594]  Hey Alex!
[03:04:12.594 --> 03:04:14.276]  Hey, we got about 45 seconds, go ahead.
[03:04:16.092 --> 03:04:23.154]  Okay, well basically when I was trying to get my goats back that the city took from me that I was trying to basically feed my children because I can't breastfeed.
[03:04:23.154 --> 03:04:27.775]  Ma'am, I wanted, hold on a second, I wanted you on as a guest and I don't know if we've contacted you.
[03:04:27.775 --> 03:04:29.275]  Let me get your name and number.
[03:04:29.275 --> 03:04:33.436]  I wanted to cover the lady that can't have goats, you know, little tiny goats in her backyard.
[03:04:33.436 --> 03:04:34.916]  I wanted to get you on as a guest.
[03:04:34.916 --> 03:04:38.297]  Instead of just getting you on for 60 seconds, give me your name and number.
[03:04:38.297 --> 03:04:39.177]  We'll get it.
[03:04:39.177 --> 03:04:41.077]  Nico does an amazing job.
[03:04:41.077 --> 03:04:43.338]  We'll call you in the next hour and we'll set you up for the show.
[03:04:43.338 --> 03:04:43.858]  How does that sound?
[03:04:45.922 --> 03:04:53.816]  Alright, Scott, get her name and number and get her on the nightly news of this show for like 30 minutes because I want to talk about the war on microagriculture.
[03:04:53.816 --> 03:04:57.041]  That's the real war on humans by this AI takeover.
[03:04:57.041 --> 03:04:57.823]  Gotta beat the AI.
