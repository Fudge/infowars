[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.960]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.360]  None of this means the DOJ is going to stop prosecuting political dissidents, however,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.000]  they're full speed ahead on that.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.260]  The DOJ, the Biden administration, announced it's charging a host at InfoWars, a man called
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.380]  Owen Schroyer, with several federal crimes, including, quote, entering a restricted area
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.380]  on January 6th.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.120]  Well, that sounds bad.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.400]  What did Owen Schroyer do?
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.600]  He didn't go inside the Capitol building on January 6th.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.200]  He stood on the Capitol steps with hundreds of other people.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.200]  He didn't even loot Macy's, like Black Lives Matter.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.800]  He just stood there on the Capitol steps, a building he thought he owned as an American
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.160]  citizen.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400]  What's going on here, exactly?
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.160]  Well, Owen Schroyer's real crime appeared to have occurred in December of 2019, when
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.360]  he shouted mean things to Jerry Nadler during a congressional hearing.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.960]  The DOJ accused him of disorderly conduct and told him, never go near the Capitol again.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.460]  You don't want to hurt Jerry Nadler's feelings.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.680]  He disobeyed.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.600]  Now he's going to jail on Monday.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.740]  Are you cool with this, Dick Cheney's daughter?
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.880]  Is that all right with you?
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.200]  Is this the country you want to live in?
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.040]  How about that, Adam Kinzinger?
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.400]  Is this the democracy you fought for?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.400]  Please.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400]  Good evening.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.120]  Thank you for joining us on this emergency Saturday transmission.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.120]  I've been on air 27 years.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.080]  And if you go back a decade ago, I might have done one emergency broadcast a year.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.600]  And then the last few years, I started doing emergency broadcasts every few months.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920]  Now we're doing them almost every day.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.200]  And that's because our world is in crisis.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.280]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.800]  And everything I'm about to lay out here is documented and is incredibly illegal and
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.960]  unbelievably dangerous.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.900]  And so we're about to lay it out right now.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.400]  And this is only a small portion of what's going on.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.480]  But in the interest of really drilling down into all of it and fleshing it out, we're
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.120]  going to just cover four different topics here in this important news briefing.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.240]  And then we've got two big exclusive interviews with Dr. Francis Boyle, top lawyer, author
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.480]  of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law, the man that first exposed the Wuhan lab has been
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.480]  vindicated and proven completely right, a hero, the guy that stopped experimental shots
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.840]  two separate times at the Pentagon where they were giving our troops deadly anthrax shots.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.560]  He's going to join us and lay out the Nuremberg code violations that are taking place with
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.640]  this forced vaccine rollout and how to counter it legally.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.400]  So this is important for our military, for our police, for our citizens, for everybody,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.520]  because it's the first responders that are being targeted first.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.960]  So they'll then be happy to target us.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.880]  So we've got to stand with that front line as best we can.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.400]  Speaking of standing with that front line, when someone working for the federal government
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.360]  or state government or local government follows a constitution and does a good job, they're
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.640]  our brethren and we should defend them when Black Lives Matter and others try to defund
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]  them.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.920]  But we have to also be honest with ourselves about the fact that at the federal level,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.960]  most of the major institutions have been seized by a multinational criminal cabal, the globalists,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.400]  the Davos group, U.N. system that the Rockefellers set up.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.800]  And that's our first big piece of news here tonight before I get to all the other news.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.480]  And that's Owen Schroyer.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.400]  Owen Schroyer is a good friend of mine.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.040]  He's been here five years now or more.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.640]  And he, of course, was given the horrible news just yesterday that they have an arrest
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.840]  warrant out for him for attacking and breaching the Capitol and a bunch of other garbage on
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.880]  January 6th.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.680]  And what's incredible about this, and we're going to be putting reports out that document
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.720]  all that, we're going to play some of that evidence here in a moment, is that in their
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:26.560]  very filing, they lie throughout it and even source videos that show the exact opposite
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560]  in their filing.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:39.680]  It would be like if you turned in an essay in school and said that you wrote it, but
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:48.480]  then you turned in a memory stick with a video of you copying it down from the person's desk
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]  right next to you.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.920]  I mean, why would they lie like this and then put exhibits that just on their face show
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920]  that they're lying?
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.560]  I mean, this is really criminal activity, and I don't have some pointless hard on for
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.680]  the FBI to just run them down.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.160]  I want to live in a good, free country.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.480]  I am really freaked out by this.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.320]  So he's supposed to report to jail on Monday.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.520]  They're trying to put him in prison for more than five years.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.320]  And again, they say he attacked and physically breached the Capitol, didn't go in the Capitol.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.860]  They then just tell a whole bunch of other really bizarre lies, like he didn't finish
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.700]  his community service for when he was at a demonstration years ago and protesting and
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.220]  got arrested peacefully protesting.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.080]  He completed his community hours.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.080]  That's all done.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080]  That was discharged.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.380]  So that's what I'm saying is the whole thing is a lie and it's shocking.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.740]  And they source as the proof of him attacking and going into the building, footage of him
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.740]  with me when we show up in the middle of it and try to turn the crowds back so they don't
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.700]  go in and don't get set up.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.860]  And so there's not a new Kent State.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.740]  Now you're about to see body cam footage from just a few minutes after I got up on a pile
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.060]  of chairs on the lawn of the Capitol and tried to get some of the crowd going in the building
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.780]  to turn back and not go in because they didn't know they had to see people up front breaching.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.380]  They were being told that the police had opened up the Capitol and to go in.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.260]  So I was trying to stop them.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.220]  We then went around the other side of the Capitol and try to stop things.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.420]  And I talked to the police on body cam footage and said, get on your loudspeakers that you
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.420]  have set up.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.100]  Tell people to leave the building.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.380]  Let me get on the loudspeakers.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.780]  And they said no.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.540]  But then they said, but you can go up and use your voice to try to get people to come
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.620]  back down off of the Capitol steps.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.980]  And so Owen, who works for me, who's a journalist and a reporter with my security team and other
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.220]  reporters went up to the top.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.900]  It was so loud, so much music, so many bull horns.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.980]  Most people couldn't hear us, but we did get several thousand people to actually leave
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.260]  and to not go into the Capitol.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.540]  And that was our job.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.100]  And all those people that heard us, I've gotten so many compliments and so many thank yous
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.780]  from their families and them saying, Alex, we didn't know we were going to go in and
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.260]  they would have been charged and put in solitary confinement as well.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.860]  So now here's Owen Schroyer being charged, has to turn himself in on Monday for assaulting
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.740]  the Capitol when in their own exhibit, they say he's with Alex Jones trying to stop people
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.740]  going in.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.540]  And then we have the body cam footage of the police saying, you can go up there and use
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.420]  your voice to try to get people to come down.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.740]  I even got permission and they know this and they purposely misrepresented to the judge
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.740]  and the court.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.460]  And I am just shocked by this level of criminal activity.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.940]  For a long time, I thought it was just ineptitude or something by the FBI, but not anymore,
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.940]  man.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.700]  These are SJW liberal lawyers now at the Justice Department.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.900]  And they they would indict Mother Teresa, ladies and gentlemen, for saving a starving
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.900]  child.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:04.300]  I mean, I'm just flabbergasted that America is this bankrupt of a country morally.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:12.580]  We're not the communist people, we're patriots, we're peaceful, and we're here because we love America, and we love each other, and we love the truth.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.580]  We need to not have the confrontation with the police, we're going to make that the story.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.580]  I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.860]  peacefully.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.860]  Tell everybody behind you, march to the other side, march to the other side.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:50.860]  You guys are great, but the police provocateurs have caused a problem and the police are throwing
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.860]  flashbangs.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.860]  We don't want to have a Kent State here.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.860]  Yes, tell people behind you, come off the stage.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.140]  We're not stealing the stage like the Democrats did.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.140]  You've done a great job.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.140]  Come down off of there.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.140]  Let's peacefully go over here.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.140]  Tell everyone you know, do not be part of this.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.140]  Tell everybody to come onto this side.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.140]  Provocateurs are setting us up.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.140]  Let's talk to them and see if we can get you on the platform and de-escalate it.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.140]  Hey guys, let's take a break right here.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.140]  Let me talk to this cop and see if I can get Alex up there and de-escalate the situation.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.420]  Bubble up, take a pause.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.420]  Bro, no hand, nothing.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.420]  I'm with Alex Jones, man.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.420]  I'm telling you right now, he just tried to de-escalate this stuff.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.420]  If we can talk to someone and get him up there, we can get them to back off.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.420]  This is the problem?
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.420]  Okay, so we need to get him up there to tell people to...
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.420]  Is there a way that we can get him to a position...
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.420]  We didn't reach anything.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.420]  We just showed up.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.700]  They're trying to help.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.700]  We need somebody to run and coordinate that recce if that's where we're going.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.700]  I think we go talk to them and get him on these steps if we can.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.700]  You never know that.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.700]  There's a problem that they can't handle.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.700]  That's not good.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.700]  Let's go over here and regroup, Tim.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.700]  I want to talk to them and see if we can get you on these steps.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.980]  I don't think there's a problem out there.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.980]  I don't know.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.980]  There might be a fight going on over there.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.980]  There's some shit.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.980]  Tim, I'm going to talk to them real quick.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.980]  I'm with Alex Jones, man.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.980]  He's a big, big populist movement guy.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.980]  He will de-escalate this situation.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260]  We got to put him somewhere to speak to them.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260]  We just did it on that side to pull people off the scaffolds.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260]  If not, the mob's the mob.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260]  But I'm telling you, this entire crowd will listen to him.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260]  It's a fact.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260]  So where can we take him and talk to the people
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260]  so that this doesn't turn into
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260]  something that doesn't need to be?
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260]  Who can we coordinate with?
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260]  We got tons of law enforcement with us.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260]  Is there somebody we can speak to?
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260]  I get it. And we're trying to help, dude.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260]  And I'm telling you, you will see a miracle happen if it happens.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260]  He's a vest.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260]  Boss, I was told to speak to you.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260]  I want to talk to Alex Jones' security guards.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260]  He can de-escalate this entire situation
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260]  if you give him a little platform
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260]  to speak to the crowd. I promise you.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260]  I'm not authorized to do that.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260]  I know. I don't want it to turn into something that's not.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260]  I'm telling you, you can help.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260]  We got tons of law enforcement in our team, man.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.540]  They will listen to him.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.540]  Okay, what do you recommend?
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.540]  See what you can do.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.540]  I promise you he can make it happen.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.540]  We don't want to be rebellious.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.540]  He can fix this.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.540]  He can de-escalate the whole thing.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.540]  I'm telling you.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.540]  I would try it for 30 seconds and you'll see.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.540]  If not, we'll bounce.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.820]  I'm telling you it'll work, dude.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.820]  We're on your side.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.820]  He can move this whole populace.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.820]  They all follow him.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.820]  We do. We do.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.820]  I just want to put him in a place
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.820]  where they'll hear him and see him
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820]  and he'll tell everyone,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.820]  we're not here to be violent. Stop.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.820]  You're letting the provocateurs turn this
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.820]  into some shit they don't need to be.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.820]  And it's only going to get worse.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.820]  We all know that. We're all on the same team.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.820]  So you got to diffuse it before
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.100]  it's too late.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.100]  Nah, it's not good, dude. It's not good.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.100]  It's fucked.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.100]  It's fucked.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.100]  No way. No fucking way.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.100]  No way.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.100]  I'm telling you, man.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.100]  We can stop this shit right now, dude.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.100]  It's not going to be good.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.380]  Alright.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.380]  I know.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.380]  I know. He was talking to his hires
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.380]  to try to get him up here.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.380]  Well, they're going to go
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.380]  to jail.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.380]  Alright, man.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.380]  Slow and steady, dude.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.380]  Hands.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.380]  Yeah.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.380]  We can get you a couple steps up
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.380]  if you need to. Exactly.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.380]  Let's see what happens.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.380]  Right here. They're telling him
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.660]  to hold the line.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.660]  Guys, I don't know who's in charge.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.660]  We tried to get him to call.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.660]  If we can get Alex up there,
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.660]  we can de-escalate this whole thing.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.660]  They all follow him.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.660]  It'll all turn peaceful. He just has to speak.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.660]  I'm telling you, dude.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.660]  We're all on the same team.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.660]  This shit is not going to be good.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.660]  But I don't want to break the law.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.940]  That doesn't make it okay.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.940]  We got all retired special ops guys,
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.940]  law enforcement.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.940]  We're not trying to be wrong.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.940]  Who do we talk to
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.940]  to make this happen the right way?
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.940]  I think it looks too late.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.940]  We can de-escalate things.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.940]  They don't have enough numbers to do that.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.940]  I'm telling you right now.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.220]  I hear you.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.220]  See? It's not going to be good.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.220]  It's not going to be good.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.220]  What's up?
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.220]  Do what?
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.220]  I said go ahead and make your way that way.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500]  Are you getting your feet out?
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.500]  If you guys get a way
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.500]  to get him to speak to the crowd,
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.500]  I promise you he's going to de-escalate it.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.500]  What we don't want is it spun.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.500]  Alex Jones takes Capitol fucking grounds.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.500]  That's not good, dude.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500]  I could probably get those people off there
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500]  before they storm the whole Capitol.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500]  I'd already talked to one.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.500]  He was talking to somebody.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.780]  If anybody can do it, he can do it.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.780]  Just get him up there?
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.780]  Hey, Tim.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.780]  Just get him up there
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.780]  and just do it.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.780]  But we know we might catch a bang or two.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.780]  How big is the stage?
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.780]  I say we just go to the stage
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.780]  and just do speeches.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.780]  I'll do our best for the problem.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.780]  Let this happen
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.780]  and we'll do our thing.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.780]  So let that sink in
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.780]  that in America we have massive
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.780]  persecution
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.780]  and literal prosecution
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.780]  of innocent journalists
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.780]  and the FBI uses
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.780]  as the evidence
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.780]  of the fact that they need to go to jail
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.780]  footage of them trying to stop
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.780]  the commission of a crime.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.780]  I mean, is this really
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.780]  what we have become?
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.060]  Have turned into?
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.060]  Now I just showed you a short clip of Tucker Carlson from Friday night.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.060]  The whole show is extremely powerful
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.060]  and he nailed it with the documents
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.060]  and the proof that Biden and Pelosi
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.060]  are suppressing those thousands of hours
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.060]  of footage and the witnesses
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.060]  and the federal documents that have come out
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.060]  showing that the FBI had
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.060]  provocateurs inside that actually
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.060]  did lead the original
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.060]  group that actually helped
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.060]  break in so that then the hundreds
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060]  of thousands of people outside
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.340]  would think that everything was okay
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.340]  and to go inside once the police were then ordered
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.340]  to stand down and open up the gates.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.340]  And on this they're launching
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.340]  an announcement that Americans
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.340]  are terrorists. They're announcing
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.340]  that the new main threat is
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.340]  Trump supporters and people that question elections
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.340]  or lockdowns and they're rolling it
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.340]  all out based on the January 6
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.340]  lie and Owen Schroyer is a witness
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.340]  to this. He's on weekdays
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.340]  3pm, reaches millions of people
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.340]  and if they can target a journalist
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.620]  like him and punish someone
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.620]  who heroically went and tried to stop that
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.620]  disaster that the FBI
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.620]  clearly greased the skids for
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.620]  just like they did in the kidnapping plot
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.620]  of Governor Whitmer in Michigan
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.620]  if they can try to put him
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.620]  in jail for all these years and make him
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.620]  report while he waits for trial to some federal
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.620]  prison on Monday
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.620]  none of us are safe
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.620]  and that's why we have to find our soul
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.620]  again. We have to find our courage again
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.620]  we have to come together as a nation
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.900]  and say it doesn't matter if it's Michael Moore
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.900]  or whether it's Owen Schroyer
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.900]  or whether it's Bill Maher
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.900]  or whether it's AOC
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.900]  or whether it's Matt Drudge
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.900]  or whether it's Tucker Carlson
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.900]  we all have our free speech in this country
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.900]  and the press needs to be protected
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.900]  and speech needs to be protected
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.900]  because if you don't have speech you live
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.900]  in a tyranny and let's just face it
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.900]  we are now living in a very serious
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.900]  tyranny. Owen's fight is
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.900]  all of our fight. Infowars
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.180]  fight is your fight and it's my fight
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.180]  we are in this together
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.180]  and Infowars is maxed out on our
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.180]  spending in the fight against the globalists
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.180]  that's why when you buy the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.180]  the books, the films, the t-shirts
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.180]  all of it, it makes all this possible
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.180]  but that's also why we're a target
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.180]  because we are effective exposing
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.180]  the globalist agenda and the globalists
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.180]  are starting to fail not just here
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.180]  but around the world. So we need to
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.180]  raise a lot of money to get a top flight
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.180]  lawyer for Owen Schroyer
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.460]  we also need to file some defamation suits
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.460]  we're filing enough to do it because the mainstream media
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.460]  is saying he led the attack and
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.460]  did break in and praised people
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.460]  that broke in. This is open and shut
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.460]  defamation and at a certain
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.460]  point we have to start fighting back and that's going to
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.460]  cost money as well.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.460]  DefendOwen.com
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.460]  that's what Owen set up himself with his lawyer
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.460]  criminal lawyer Norm Pattis
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.460]  and if you go to Defend
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.460]  Owen.com and make a $5
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.460]  $100, $20 donation it doesn't matter
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.740]  it will go towards fighting
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.740]  the globalists and letting them know we're not
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.740]  going to roll over to this type of out of control
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.740]  tyranny. Now again, coming up in just a
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.740]  few minutes we're going to interview Dr. Francis
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.740]  Boyle and then we're going to be interviewing
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.740]  Owen Schroyer in the other studio as
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.740]  well. He'll exclusively break down
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.740]  what really happened and where he's planning to go
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.740]  from here. So that is
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.740]  all coming up. But right now
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.740]  before we get into the incredible
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.740]  information coming out of these so-called vaccines
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.740]  from even major governments admitting
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.740]  that they're killing record numbers of people
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.740]  before we do that let's look at
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.740]  these articles because this goes to the
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.740]  psychology and the motive
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.740]  of this soulless
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.740]  ruling class that
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.740]  are running things that have
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.740]  set the precedent to get away with whatever
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.740]  they want whenever they want.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.740]  Now you notice that
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.740]  the media makes jokes
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.740]  about pedophilia and basically says it doesn't exist.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.740]  While mainstream news and children's
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.740]  programs sexualize children
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.740]  and while we see record numbers of busts
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.740]  around the world not just here
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.740]  of elites and Hollywood
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.740]  scum and others trafficking
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.740]  in children and the Clintons
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.740]  have been caught smuggling children out of Haiti
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.740]  and so is the UN.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.740]  The list goes on and on.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.740]  But now it's finally all over the news
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.740]  even in the New York Times
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.740]  that the CIA
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.740]  starting around the time that Obama
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.740]  got into office
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.740]  began
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.740]  wait for this
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.740]  to supply little
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.740]  boys to the
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.740]  Afghan warlords because that's part of the culture
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.740]  in Afghanistan is pedophilia
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.740]  and that they
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.740]  would even put pedophiles in
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.740]  charge on purpose because they
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.740]  controlled them. The same thing
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.740]  MI6 and MI5 have done in England
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.740]  the same thing the CIA has
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.740]  been doing here to corrupt people and
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.740]  take over different institutions
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.740]  like the Catholic Church like Penn
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.740]  State. The list goes on and on.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.740]  It is pedophilia that
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.740]  binds these people together in their corruption
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.740]  and look at this report.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.740]  CIA officers kept Afghan warlords
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.740]  dependent on
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.740]  the agency by giving them Viagra to rape
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.740]  young boys. That's an interesting headline
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.740]  but that to me is a sub angle of this.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.740]  In the government reports
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.740]  this is now confirmed. They're
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.740]  not denying it. They chose to
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.740]  place pedophiles in charge
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.740]  and told tribal councils that
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.740]  they wanted pedophiles in charge
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.740]  and they would even supply them with the boys
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.740]  not the
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.740]  Viagra. You've got to go
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.740]  see this for yourself.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.740]  In 2015 in Afghanistan soldiers
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.740]  and marines were troubled that
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.740]  instead of weeding out pedophiles the American
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.740]  military was arming them and in some cases
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.740]  placing them with the commanders
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.740]  of villages. That's the
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.740]  New York Times.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.740]  So remember that that's what
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.740]  they admit they're doing and ask
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.740]  yourselves do these people
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.740]  have any soul at all?
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.740]  And the answer is
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.740]  yes. They have a soul of evil.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.740]  The people running the CIA
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.740]  now probably always
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.740]  was this way but the ones at the top
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.740]  and the ones doing this
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.740]  are absolutely corrupt and are
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.740]  using the abuse of children
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.740]  and using
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.740]  this psychic vampire behavior
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.740]  to basically
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.740]  create a network of pedophiles that they
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.740]  control. And
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.740]  it's the ultimate sin.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.740]  And I told you this decades ago
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.740]  and now it's out in the open just like it came out
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.740]  in Germany last year and it was finally in
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.740]  New Yorker magazine of all places last month
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.740]  that 30 plus thousand children in
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.740]  just one city it turned out it was all over Germany
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.740]  after the U.S. took over Germany
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.740]  after World War II
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.740]  sent in psychologists and psychiatrists
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.740]  who said pedophilia
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.740]  is good for children and gave
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.740]  tens of thousands of children as young as three years old
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.740]  to convicted pedophiles
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.740]  and they said we're creating a new form of
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.740]  love, nambla, and
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.740]  that this is the new family.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.740]  They would then hire the children
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.740]  out once they were trained
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.740]  at about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years of
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.740]  age to go to satanic rituals
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.740]  and orgies inside
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.740]  major churches and other facilities.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.740]  And this is how they blackmailed and got
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.740]  control. So when you wonder why these
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.740]  politicians look so evil
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.740]  when you wonder why they look so satanic
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.740]  and fake, why they're into such weird stuff
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.740]  because many of the
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.740]  top politicians you see, particularly Democrats
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.740]  major governors of west coast states
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.740]  are heavily into this
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.740]  and the type of stuff that
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.740]  Ed Buck was doing
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.740]  murdering black men
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.740]  in satanic rituals and then calling
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.740]  it drug overdoses is just the
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.740]  tip of the iceberg. So there you
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.740]  have it, ladies and gentlemen. Go research
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.740]  it and look at it for yourself and
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.740]  then you'll understand
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.740]  why the FBI is so satanic
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.740]  now and that they would invert
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.740]  reality
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.740]  and that they would then say that we
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.740]  attacked the Capitol when we tried to stop
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.740]  it and even use our own
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.740]  video that shows we tried to stop it
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.740]  and tell a judge that we did the
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.740]  opposite on the video as if the judge is too dumb
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.740]  to even look at it. But I guess that means they've got these
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.740]  judges in their pockets. I mean,
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.740]  why even put out fake evidence then?
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.740]  It's just crazy.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.740]  Why would you put pedophiles in charge?
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.740]  Why would you rape little kids?
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.740]  Why would you cover it up? And I'm not saying
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.740]  the FBI is as bad as the CIA when it comes to this
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.740]  but this group is taking over.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.740]  This group is kicking the good people
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.740]  out of every system in America
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.740]  and every culture around the world and putting
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.740]  their evil people in.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.740]  Now let's tie this into big tech
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.740]  because you've seen some of the
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.740]  lawsuits now dealing with Twitter
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.740]  knowing that pedophilia
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.740]  and exploitation of children take
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.740]  place. Child porn and as
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.740]  bad as Twitter is, it's nothing compared to Google
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.740]  and YouTube
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.740]  and Facebook and
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.740]  Apple. And so it came out
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.740]  a few weeks ago that Apple
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.740]  is scanning all your photos
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.740]  and basically reading through your phone
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.740]  with AI systems but also giving
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.740]  their own quote fact checkers
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.740]  and third parties that they hire
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.740]  access into your text messages, into
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.740]  your photos, into everything without a
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.740]  warrant reviewing and tracking
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.740]  everything you do. That's pre-crime
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.740]  that's the essence of tyranny.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.740]  And of course, Apple is doing
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.740]  this in the name
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.740]  of stopping and fighting
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.740]  pedophilia. And Bill Maher
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.740]  had an excellent angle on just
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.740]  how asinine this is.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.740]  And finally, new rule, Apple
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.740]  needs to think
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740]  different about our privacy.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.740]  Apple, the company that made it possible
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.740]  for men to show their women their
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.740]  dicks from thousands of miles away
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.740]  is releasing an update
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.740]  that will allow them to hack into your
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.740]  phone without your consent to snoop
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.740]  through all your pictures just in case
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.740]  you're a pedophile. Or as Matt
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.740]  Gates put it, I'm switching to Samsung.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.740]  Now, let me be clear, I'm against
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.740]  pedophilia. That's why I joined QAnon.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.740]  But nosing
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.740]  through everybody's private photo stash
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.740]  is casting an awfully wide
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.740]  intrusive net. It's like if the company
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.740]  that sold you a safe said,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.740]  oh, and we're going to stop by sometimes when you're not
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.740]  home to make sure you're not keeping
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.740]  naked pictures of kids in it.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.740]  Our phones should be like our wallets
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.740]  or purses, private.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.740]  Again, that is such a great analogy.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.740]  It'd be like a safe company that
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.740]  sells people safes, but then it wants
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.740]  a backdoor access to it with a camera
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.740]  basically mounted inside the safe
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.740]  so it can make sure inside your safe
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.740]  you're not doing something bad.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.740]  Our phones are extensions of ourselves.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.740]  They tell us we have this privacy
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.740]  and it gives us all this freedom, but the truth is
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.740]  it is a globalist window or
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.740]  a tentacle into our lives,
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.740]  into our homes, and it's run by
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.740]  ruthless evil predatory groups
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.740]  like Tim Cook and Apple that
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.740]  run giant slave camps in China,
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.740]  the worst in the world, and put up suicide
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.740]  nets around their factories and
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.740]  have forced abortions and
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.740]  have their components made with millions of people
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.740]  in death camps like the
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.740]  Uighurs. Oh, but
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.740]  if you tried to break into Tim
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.740]  Cook's house and surveil him, you get life in prison.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.740]  But when he tells you, hey,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.740]  I'm going to scan your
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.740]  photos and I'm going to read what you're writing and I'm going to
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.740]  listen to you. It's just one
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.740]  more level of Orwellian control
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.740]  that would have been unthinkable
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.740]  just a few years ago.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.740]  So the German government in every
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.740]  major city in Germany for
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.740]  decades placed
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.740]  tens of thousands of children
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.740]  per town and city with
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.740]  convicted child rapists
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.740]  to raise them into the pedophilia
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.740]  lifestyle and to use them to procure
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.740]  other children. And the CIA is doing
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.740]  the same thing, not just in Afghanistan, but around
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.740]  the world. It's similar things in
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.740]  MK Naomi and MK Ultra
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.740]  projects that have been partially
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.740]  declassified. This is
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.740]  nothing but an excuse for evil satanic
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.740]  groups to operate under
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.740]  the cover of national security.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.740]  And the CIA should be abolished
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.740]  and the National Security Act of 1947 should be abolished.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.740]  And it's these groups
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.740]  that should be brought out into the light of day
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.740]  with a spotlight of investigation
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.740]  a hundred times stronger than what we saw
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.740]  with Senator Frank Church's committee.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.740]  It is this shadow government. It is this bureaucracy
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.740]  that interfaces with the corporations
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.740]  of the world that has become a breakaway
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.740]  civilization and is above the law
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.740]  and is now telling us under the Great Reset
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.740]  we're non-essential. They're going to lock us in our houses
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.740]  and make us communicate with each other via virtual
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.740]  reality while they starve the third world to death
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.740]  and bring us forced inoculations.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.740]  You see the tyranny
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.740]  isn't coming.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.740]  The tyranny is here and it's only going to get worse
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.740]  until we start saying no to these
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.740]  people. And at the rock
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.740]  bottom of this is the abuse
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.740]  of children and innocents.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.740]  That's what the satanists want.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.740]  And every wives tale and every culture
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.740]  they warn about it and in reality it's there
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.740]  and now it's out of the open and the
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.740]  mask is off because we haven't stood up to it.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.740]  They think it's their right to come after us.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.740]  I had a very
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.740]  prominent doctor who's an acidic
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.740]  Jew on my show yesterday
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.740]  and he
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.740]  has treated over 40,000 patients
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.740]  and saved them all when he's been able to get
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.740]  access to them. He saw many of his patients
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.740]  taken forcibly and put in quarantine
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.740]  and then intubated and killed
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.740]  and he said this is
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.740]  a genocide
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.740]  that is taking place and that it is
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.740]  a cultic and that it is
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.740]  pagan and that that's basically who
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.740]  Klaus Schwab is. And he's a renowned
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.740]  medical doctor and he studied the history
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.740]  and he understands it.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.740]  And he basically talked about how this is
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.740]  modern child sacrifice now
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.740]  that they're coming at our children with these
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.740]  experimental shots that have already killed
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.740]  so many people. It's one thing to pressure
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.740]  and push adults into doing something
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.740]  that still violates the Nuremberg Code. But what they're
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.740]  doing is so much even more intense.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.740]  So here's a couple big articles. Here's one
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.740]  out of RT quoting the London
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.740]  Spectator magazine
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.740]  off the UK government's own reporting system.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.740]  30,000 plus women
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.740]  are having horrible menstrual cycles
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.740]  sloughing all sorts of bleeding.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.740]  They basically can't have children right now
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.740]  because their uteruses
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.740]  are in total turmoil
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.740]  and basically they're having their periods
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.740]  around the clock
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.740]  so they can't get pregnant. Surprise, surprise.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.740]  A lot of top scientists warned
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.740]  that looking at these vaccines when they first came
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.740]  out, so-called vaccines, that it would actually
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.740]  attack the uterus and the reproductive
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.740]  system. But of course they had
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.740]  snopes and others come out with no evidence to say
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.740]  that that wasn't the truth. And now women
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.740]  across the world are seeing the full horror
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.740]  of again this ritualistic
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.740]  assault on their fertility. Again, on
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.740]  our children, on our future. All right,
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.740]  in closing,
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.740]  I want to thank you all for tuning in on this Saturday
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.740]  evening. I want to thank the crew for coming in as well.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.740]  And I want to thank Dr. Boyle for coming
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.740]  on and I also want to thank Owen for
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.740]  coming on the air and talking to us.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.740]  Again, we taped it earlier. You're about to see it.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.740]  It was in the other studio.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.740]  But understand this.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.740]  We can beat these globalists.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.740]  We have responsibility to. And we also
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.740]  just from a pragmatic
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.740]  perspective need to because
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.740]  going along with the system up until now has gotten
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.740]  a lot of people ahead. But
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.740]  now that we're going into the real collapse cycle
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.740]  of tyranny, going along with it will
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.740]  get you basically destroyed.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.740]  And they are purposely collapsing civilization
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.740]  with the great reset right now. They
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.740]  are creating a very dystopian system
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.740]  that they sell us as
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.740]  necessary to save the earth. And
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.740]  if we don't say no to this and if we don't
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.740]  start not complying,
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.740]  all the incredible oppression
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.740]  and tyranny and contact
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.740]  tracers and emergency FEMA
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.740]  centers being built
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.740]  and drag queen storytime and
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.740]  all the racial division and all the devaluation
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.740]  of the currencies, the open borders and the diseases
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.740]  and all of it is just the tip
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.740]  of the iceberg. It is their plan
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.740]  by the year 2030
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.740]  to already have depopulated
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.740]  billions of people off the earth. It's
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.740]  in the plans. They're going to
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.740]  cure poverty, all right, because they're going to get rid of people.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.740]  And so the controlled collapse
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.740]  is accelerating and we've left beta
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.740]  and we're going into operational. So it's
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.740]  very important for everybody to realize that
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.740]  there is a major resistance to the
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.740]  globalist. And they had this
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.740]  plan set for further out in the future, but because
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.740]  of nationalism and populism
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.740]  and their agenda not going well and
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.740]  because of the shadow government being exposed,
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.740]  they are now trying
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.740]  to accelerate this plan, not out of strength,
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.740]  but out of weakness. So we're going to have a better
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.740]  world by fighting back. We're going to have a better
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.740]  world by saying no. We're going
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.740]  to have a better world by not being
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.740]  intimidated and not submitting.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.740]  The reason the FBI is openly
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.740]  doing corrupt things right now is to intimidate
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.740]  everybody. They want to be the bad guys.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.740]  They want you to be
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.740]  scared of them. They want
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.740]  you to be horrified and hide
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.740]  under the table basically. But
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.740]  if we do that,
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.740]  we then sign on to the CIA
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.740]  run by all these pedophiles
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.740]  and all these globalist organizations
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.740]  and
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.740]  the sociopaths
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.740]  and we deliver our children into a living hell.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.740]  But hey, a lot of people don't care about
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.740]  their kids or they don't have kids. Well, here's the news.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.740]  Even if you don't care
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.740]  about anybody but yourself, going along
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.740]  with the New World Order
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.740]  is going to destroy you.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.740]  There are no winners in this thing in the
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.740]  end. This is purely satanic.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.740]  Alright, please keep us on air.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.740]  Please take this report and share
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.740]  it on all different platforms you can.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.740]  You are the resistance. I salute you and I thank you.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.740]  And please research the Nuremberg
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.740]  Code for yourself and then share this report with others
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.740]  because truth
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.740]  is contagious. It's unstoppable, but
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.740]  somebody's got to carry the truth.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.740]  Somebody's got to get that truth out
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.740]  to people. So if you choose to take action,
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.740]  share this information,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.740]  tell others to share it, and tell them
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.740]  to tell others to share it and that
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.740]  creates the chain reaction.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.740]  Again, thank you so much for watching. Now, please
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.740]  start sharing this critical report.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.740]  And thank you for joining us on this very
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.740]  important Emergency Saturday
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.740]  Bulletin. I have gotten hundreds
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.740]  of calls on air the last few months
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.740]  and massive emails.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.740]  People on the street have said that Dr.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.740]  Francis Boyle, can you please
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.740]  get him back on about the Nuremberg Code
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.740]  about trying to make the military take
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.740]  experimental shots? What is the military's
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.740]  rights? How does the military challenge
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.740]  unlawful orders? How do you
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.740]  exercise the
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.740]  law? What do we
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.740]  do? So he's the author of the U.S. Biological
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.740]  Weapons Treaty. He contributed to the
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.740]  World Treaties. He's been a big UN
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.740]  head prosecutor that prosecuted Solomon
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.740]  Milosevic and others. So he's a
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.740]  lawyer's lawyer on this with
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.740]  multiple degrees from Harvard, you
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.740]  name it, to be able to lay all this
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.740]  out. And so I'm going to try to shut up here on
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.740]  the Saturday show and give him
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.740]  the floor to just walk
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.740]  through the
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.740]  Nuremberg Code, what's going
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.740]  on with these shots. But also, I
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.740]  know that Dr. Boyle doesn't like to digress,
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.740]  but for
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.740]  folks that didn't see the dozen or so interviews
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.740]  he did in the last 18 months here,
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.740]  he predicted everything
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.740]  that would happen. They come out with a vaccine that wouldn't work.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.740]  They'd have, quote, booster shots that didn't work.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.740]  He predicted it would cause everything
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.740]  that we've seen so far. So,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.740]  wow, wherever he wants to begin, it's great to have
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.740]  him here. And we really, really appreciate his
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.740]  time. Dr. Boyle, thank you.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.740]  Well, thank you very much
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.740]  for having me on, Alex, and
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.740]  my best to your
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.740]  viewing audience.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.740]  You just heard my preface, but you're the expert
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.740]  here. Where should we start with this
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.740]  fiasco that you predicted?
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.740]  Alex,
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.740]  right now, I want to
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.740]  sketch out a strategy
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.740]  for resistance
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.740]  that all of your
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.740]  viewers can undertake
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.740]  if they want to resistance
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.740]  to this
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.740]  medical tyranny.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.740]  And I hope people could
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.740]  pull out a pencil
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.740]  and paper at this time.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.740]  And I don't mean
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.740]  to sound too much like
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.740]  a law professor here.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.740]  I try to speak in
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.740]  plain English, and
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.740]  I will try to present this in
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.740]  plain English. If it departs
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.740]  from that, please interrupt
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.740]  me and ask me to explain.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.740]  But what
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.740]  we're seeing now is
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.740]  that the Biden
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.740]  administration is working
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.740]  in cahoots with
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.740]  Fauci and all the rest
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.740]  of them, imposing
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.740]  these
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.740]  Frankenshots on
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.740]  the American people.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.740]  And you can just see
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.740]  the deaths
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.740]  and disabilities rising
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.740]  up. So I want
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.740]  to
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.740]  point out then that there is
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.740]  a way we can fight back.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.740]  And the way we can fight back
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.740]  is the beauty
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.740]  of the 10th Amendment
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.740]  to the United States Constitution
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.740]  that says
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.740]  the powers
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.740]  not delegated to the United States
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.740]  by the Constitution,
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.740]  nor prohibited to
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.740]  it by the states, are
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.740]  reserved to the states respectively
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.740]  or to the people.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.740]  So
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.740]  I don't think we're going to get
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.740]  anywhere or much help from the
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.740]  federal government, because the federal government
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.740]  is after us on the
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.740]  Frankenshots. What I'm suggesting
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.740]  here then is
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.740]  that we exercise our rights
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.740]  under the 10th Amendment to the United
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.740]  States Constitution
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.740]  and try to get
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.740]  Fauci, Collins,
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.740]  Barrack,
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.740]  the Bat Queen, Menachery,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.740]  and everyone else
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.740]  involved in this indicted
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.740]  for murder
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.740]  and conspiracy
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.740]  to commit murder at
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.740]  the state and local
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.740]  levels of the
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.740]  United States government.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.740]  Likewise, I will
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.740]  go through a strategy here
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.740]  that the exact same
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.740]  thing be done
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.740]  over the Frankenshots.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.740]  So let me explain
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.740]  the first
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.740]  strategy to try to get
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.740]  Fauci, Collins,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.740]  Menachery,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.740]  the Bat Queen
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.740]  and Barrack
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.740]  and also
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740]  Dassack, indicted
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.740]  for murder and conspiracy
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.740]  to commit murder over
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.740]  the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.740]  Now, I was
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.740]  originally hired here to teach
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.740]  criminal law, and I
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.740]  taught it for seven or eight years
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.740]  before I
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.740]  moved over to teach international
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.740]  human rights law. But I still
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.740]  do criminal cases,
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.740]  both prosecution and
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.740]  defense on
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.740]  matters of principle.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.740]  Murder
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.740]  is defined
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.740]  at common law, and
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.740]  here I can't speak for all
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.740]  50 states of the
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.740]  Union, but we are a
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.740]  national law school here,
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.740]  and we train lawyers
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.740]  to practice law all over the country.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.740]  So what I am doing
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.740]  here is explaining to you
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.740]  general principles
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.740]  of criminal law
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.740]  that apply in all
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.740]  50 states of the Union.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.740]  And here, again, we have
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.740]  to focus on the state
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.740]  and local level
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.740]  because the federal government,
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.740]  the Department of Justice,
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.740]  is now all working in cahoots
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.740]  with Biden and Fauci
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.740]  and Collins
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.740]  and the rest of these people.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.740]  So at common law,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.740]  at the common law of most
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.740]  states of the Union,
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.740]  murder is
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.740]  defined as the
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.740]  unlawful killing
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.740]  of a human being
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.740]  with malice aforethought.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.740]  Okay, so let's go
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.740]  through those elements on the
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.740]  pandemic first.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.740]  On the
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.740]  unlawful killing of
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.740]  a human being, we have
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.740]  a violation of
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.740]  my Biological Weapons
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.740]  Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.740]  that is a
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.740]  federal crime punishable
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.740]  by life imprisonment.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.740]  Okay, so we have
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.740]  that element established.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.740]  Killing of a human being, yes,
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.740]  large numbers of people
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.740]  here in America
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.740]  have been killed
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.740]  by the
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.740]  coronavirus pandemic.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.740]  The probable
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.740]  estimate is well over
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.740]  now a million people,
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.740]  a million Americans in
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.740]  excess debts. All right,
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.740]  then we come malice
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.740]  of forethought. Malice
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.740]  of forethought is a legal
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.740]  term of art
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.740]  and I'm not going to spend a
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.740]  lot of time here lecturing
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.740]  you and your audience
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.740]  on all the elements
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.740]  of malice of forethought that would take
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.740]  me four or five days.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.740]  But my plan to come dump gasoline on your house at 2am
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.740]  and hope to burn you and your family out,
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.740]  does it mean premeditated plan to hurt
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.740]  somebody?
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.740]  I'm going to get into that and
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.740]  let me explain it here. There are
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.740]  different types, but in
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.740]  this case,
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.740]  with respect to the
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.740]  pandemic,
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.740]  one element of
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.740]  malice of forethought
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.740]  is manifesting grave
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.740]  indifference
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.740]  to human life, grave
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.740]  indifference to human rights.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.740]  Now, if you look at
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.740]  that smoking
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.740]  gun
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.740]  contract
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.740]  article that we went through before,
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.740]  SARS-like cluster
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.740]  of circulating bat coronavirus
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.740]  pose threat for human emergence.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.740]  We went through that. It is
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.740]  clear that Fauci,
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.740]  Menachery,
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.740]  the Bat Queen, Barak,
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.740]  Dassek,
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.740]  Collins knew
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.740]  they were manifesting
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.740]  grave indifference
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.740]  to human life.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.740]  Indeed, they had been told
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.740]  and they knew that this was
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.740]  extremely dangerous
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.740]  and hazardous.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.740]  There is no question
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.740]  at all about it. Indeed,
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.740]  that is why the Obama administration
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.740]  put a pause letter
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.740]  on this very
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.740]  dangerous, existentially
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.740]  dangerous type of gain
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.740]  of function work,
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.740]  whereupon Fauci and Collins
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.740]  then tried
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.740]  to whitewash it through Menachery
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.740]  by running it through
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.740]  the Wuhan BSL4.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.740]  So they knew
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.740]  that they were manifesting
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.740]  a grave indifference
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.740]  to human life.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.740]  So, yes,
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.740]  we have the elements
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.740]  for murder there. The unlawful
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.740]  killing of human
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.740]  being manifesting
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.740]  with malice of forethought
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.740]  a grave indifference
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.740]  to human life.
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.740]  And that is clear. Again,
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.740]  that would be the case for
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.740]  Menachery and Barak
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.740]  and their team. Everyone signed
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.740]  on to that article
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.740]  we discussed before, SARS-like
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.740]  cluster.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.740]  I'm glad you raised that, but just interject here.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.740]  You're going back to the last few exchanges
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.740]  with Senator Paul, where, as you said,
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.740]  he nailed Fauci. Fauci
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.740]  even put on conferences called gain of function
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.740]  and defended gain of function. Then he
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.740]  argued that he didn't do that. And so you're
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.740]  just going with, out of the different types of malice of
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.740]  forethought, the bare minimum
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.740]  if I secretly start building nuclear
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.740]  weapons next to your house and one of them
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.740]  leaks or poisons your neighbors,
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.740]  I had malice of forethought because I didn't care
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.740]  that I was doing something basically illegal
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.740]  right next to you. Is that what you're saying?
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.740]  That's exactly correct, Alex.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.740]  That is correct.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.740]  So all of them
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.740]  on the basis of
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.740]  just this article
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.740]  and the history of it
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.740]  and rate is in there, in my
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.740]  opinion, could be indicted
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.740]  for murder
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.740]  and conspiracy to commit murder.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.740]  Now, this is not going to happen by
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.740]  the federal government because
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.740]  the feds are all in on this
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.740]  with Biden and he controls the
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.740]  Department of Justice. So
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.740]  what do you have to do?
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.740]  Well, if you
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.740]  have lost a loved one
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.740]  as a result of the
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.740]  coronavirus pandemic,
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.740]  you have to go
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.740]  to your local state's
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.740]  attorney, district attorney,
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.740]  county prosecutor,
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.740]  or attorney general
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.740]  and demand
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.740]  that they convene
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.740]  a grand jury
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.740]  and present this evidence
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.740]  before a grand jury
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.740]  and seek an indictment
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.740]  for murder
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.740]  and conspiracy to commit murder.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.740]  Now, these local
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.740]  officials
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.740]  are accountable to you.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.740]  They are elected by the
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.740]  people of the community
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.740]  and they are paid for
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.740]  by the people of the community
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.740]  and they can be re-elected
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.740]  or dis-elected
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.740]  by the people of the
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.740]  community. And so
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.740]  they are going to listen
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.740]  to you. So my
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.740]  advice here
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.740]  is that everyone in this
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.740]  country, in the United
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.740]  States of America, who
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.740]  has lost a loved one,
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.740]  a million of them,
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.740]  as a result of this pandemic,
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.740]  go in personally
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.740]  to their state's attorney,
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.740]  district attorney,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.740]  county prosecutor,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.740]  attorney general, bring
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.740]  in that article and
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.740]  all the other evidence that
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.740]  has accumulated in the public
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.740]  record and
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.740]  demand that
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.740]  those local prosecutors
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.740]  convene
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.740]  a grand jury and
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.740]  present the case to a
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.740]  grand jury for
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.740]  indictments for murder
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.740]  and conspiracy to commit
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.740]  murder against Menachry,
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.740]  Barak,
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.740]  the Bat Queen,
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.740]  Fauci, Basak,
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.740]  and Collins, and
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.740]  everyone else that was involved
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.740]  in that project
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.740]  at the UNC BSL3.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.740]  This can
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.740]  be done. You have the power
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.740]  to do it. You will have
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.740]  to get organized
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.740]  to do it. Emails are
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.740]  not enough. My experience,
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.740]  lawyers, I hate to say,
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.740]  don't pay all that much
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.740]  attention to emails,
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.740]  but they do pay attention
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.740]  to personal appearances
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.740]  by the people
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.740]  of the community who
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.740]  elect them and pay for them
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.740]  and re-elect them
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.740]  with solid evidence
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.740]  and get them to convene those
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.740]  grand juries and
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.740]  indict them for murder
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.740]  and conspiracy to commit murder.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.740]  Now, you asked this
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.740]  other question about premeditation
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.740]  and deliberation. I want
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.740]  to make it clear, I do not support
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.740]  the death penalty. I'm a lifelong
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.740]  abolitionist myself
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.740]  and have worked against
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.740]  the death penalty. But
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.740]  that being said, since we are
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.740]  a national law school here,
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.740]  we train lawyers
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.740]  for all over the
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.740]  country. I also have
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.740]  to lecture
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.740]  my students, my law students.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.740]  I have had to lecture them on
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.740]  capital offenses.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.740]  A capital offense,
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.740]  death penalty, in addition
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.740]  to what
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.740]  I have
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.740]  discussed with you so far,
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.740]  also requires
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.740]  on top of unlawful
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.740]  killing of human beings with
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.740]  malice of forethought, premeditation
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.740]  and deliberation.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.740]  That is the
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.740]  additional element for a capital
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.740]  offense. And clearly
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.740]  what we have here
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.740]  with Menachery,
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.740]  Barrett,
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.740]  the Bat Queen, everyone
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.740]  else on that UNC
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.740]  team, this person
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.740]  from Harvard Medical School,
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.740]  this person from the Food
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.740]  and Drug Administration, which is why you
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.740]  can't believe anything the FDA tells
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.740]  you, and Fauci
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.740]  and Collins, I believe we have
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.740]  more than enough evidence here
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.740]  of premeditation and deliberation.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.740]  So if
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.740]  your
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.740]  state's attorney, district attorney,
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.740]  county prosecutor,
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.740]  attorney general,
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.740]  believes there is enough evidence
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.740]  there, sure, they could go
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.740]  for a capital offense as well.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.740]  Fortunately, I live here in the state of Illinois,
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.740]  we do not have
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.740]  the death penalty, and I oppose the death
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.740]  penalty. But as you know,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.740]  other states in the union
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.740]  do have the
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.740]  death penalty.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.740]  That would be how you would
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.740]  proceed to make a
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.740]  capital offense
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.740]  against these individuals.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.740]  Sure, well I'm not a top lawyer like you, but it seems like if you
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.740]  release a bioweapon, even by
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.740]  negligence because you knew it could happen, that seems like
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.740]  something you'd either go to prison for the rest of your life or get executed
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.740]  for. And that's why I'm glad you're here
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.740]  because you deserved a few weeks off
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.740]  during your summer vacation. You're back, everyone's been
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.740]  begging for you. They wanted you on about
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.740]  the move with these franken shots against the military
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.740]  and
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.740]  from your experience, because you helped get some of it
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.740]  stopped at the anthrax shot, how they
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.740]  would proceed. But I think you're right,
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.740]  striking at the root of
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.740]  the leak and what happened
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.740]  and now that you've been vindicated, you were here
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.740]  18 months ago with the first to report
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.740]  it, and then now it's happened
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.740]  and then now you sit on the
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.740]  show 18 months ago, 17
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.740]  months ago, you said that the shot won't work
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.740]  and then it's going to cause all these problems
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.740]  and now that's happened. So
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.740]  there's a whole waterfront to cover here, Dr.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.740]  Boylan. I've got your letter. We're going to
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.740]  repost on Infowars.com.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.740]  You're noticed by authority of the Nuremberg
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.740]  Code, the actual Nuremberg Code, which
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.740]  I see at city council meetings, your letters are being
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.740]  brought up. And so people are rediscovering
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.740]  this. There's a whole spectrum
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.740]  out there and people really want to hear what you have to say. So
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.740]  where do you want to start next?
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.740]  Right. Well, now I want to deal with the
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.740]  franken shots, Alex,
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.740]  how we can fight back on the
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.740]  franken shots.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.740]  And the legal analysis
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.740]  is pretty much the same with the franken
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.740]  shots. Unlawful
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.740]  killing of a human
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.740]  being with malice of forethought.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.740]  Unlawful. Let's start
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.740]  with that on the franken shots.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.740]  Clearly, we
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.740]  have a violation of the
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.740]  Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.740]  And that is a
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.740]  Nuremberg crime. And
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.740]  it is also a Nuremberg
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.740]  crime against humanity.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.740]  And this is the exact
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.740]  same
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.740]  statute we use to
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.740]  prosecute Nazis at
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.740]  Nuremberg. And let me
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.740]  read for you the appropriate
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.740]  passage here
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.740]  from the Nuremberg Charter,
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.740]  crimes against humanity,
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.740]  namely murder,
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.740]  extermination,
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.740]  and other inhumane acts
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.740]  committed against any civilian
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.740]  population. Clearly,
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.740]  that's what's going on here
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.740]  with the franken shots. We have a
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.740]  Nuremberg crime and a
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.740]  Nuremberg crime against humanity.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.740]  Second,
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.740]  that the killing of a human
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.740]  being from the franken
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.740]  shots. Well,
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.740]  we don't have the exact
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.740]  number here. Right
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.740]  now, there have been estimates
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.740]  in the tens of thousands
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.740]  now of Americans
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.740]  who have been killed
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.740]  by means of these franken
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.740]  shots. There are different
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.740]  I guess a lawsuit was just
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.740]  filed out there in
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.740]  California, a lawyer estimating
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.740]  40,000. I haven't
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.740]  seen the complaint there, the basis for
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.740]  his estimate.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.740]  Killing of human beings with
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.740]  malice aforethought. All right,
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.740]  here we get into
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.740]  two other variants
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.740]  of malice aforethought, namely
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.740]  an intention to kill
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.740]  or an intention to cause
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.740]  grievous bodily
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.740]  harm. Now, maybe
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.740]  the manufacturers of
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.740]  the franken shots are saying, well, you know,
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.740]  we didn't really intend to kill anyone,
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.740]  but they clearly intended
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.740]  to cause grievous bodily harm.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.740]  That is very clear
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.740]  from the adverse incidents
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.740]  that reactions
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.740]  now that are piling
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.740]  up that have been documented
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.740]  in the various reports
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.740]  and also the European
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.740]  Health Agency. And yet
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.740]  despite that, they are
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.740]  continuing
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.740]  to inflict
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.740]  franken shots
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.740]  on the American people
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.740]  despite these
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.740]  this grave
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.740]  harm,
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.740]  grievous harm
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.740]  to human bodies. So, yes,
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.740]  I think you can make
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.740]  out malice aforethought
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.740]  there, either intention to kill
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.740]  or intention to cause
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.740]  grievous bodily harm.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.740]  So, again,
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.740]  my advice, this would be a
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.740]  separate and second
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.740]  type of legal action
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.740]  different from
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.740]  the legal action
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.740]  with respect to the COVID
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.740]  pandemic itself.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.740]  I think this legal
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.740]  action would be after
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.740]  the
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.740]  SLAWI, the Operation
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.740]  Warp Speed and
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.740]  then the Chief
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.740]  Executive Officers for
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.740]  Pfizer, BioNTech
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.740]  and also
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.740]  Moderna and
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.740]  Johnson & Johnson. Those are the three
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.740]  franken shots administered
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.740]  here in the United
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.740]  States. And again,
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.740]  you would go into
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.740]  your state's
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.740]  attorney, district attorney,
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.740]  county prosecutor,
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.740]  attorney general and
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.740]  say, look here,
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.740]  we have had in
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.740]  your jurisdiction
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.740]  my loved ones
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.740]  who were killed
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.740]  as a result of these
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.740]  franken shots. And you would
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.740]  have to produce this evidence.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.740]  A coroner's report
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.740]  or an autopsy or something
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:56.740]  like that. And therefore
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.740]  I want you to convene
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.740]  a grand jury
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.740]  and request
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.740]  the indictment of
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.740]  the Chief Executive Officer
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:08.740]  SLAWI as well as the Chief
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.740]  Executive Officers for
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.740]  Pfizer. That's right, because
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.740]  they can give themselves under the 1986 Reagan
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.740]  Act that was terrible liability
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.740]  protection, but that's from civil. They don't have
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.740]  criminal protection.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.740]  That is correct. I'm dealing here
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.740]  with criminal accountability,
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.740]  Alex, that the civil
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.740]  protection is not going to help
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.740]  these people and Moderna
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.740]  and Johnson & Johnson
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.740]  for murder
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.740]  and conspiracy to commit murder.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.740]  And the state's attorney,
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.740]  county prosecutor, district attorney,
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.740]  attorney general would assemble
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.740]  the case, convene
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.740]  a grand jury, you know, under the Fifth Amendment
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.740]  to the United States Constitution.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.740]  They have a right.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.740]  It's a serious offense
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.740]  to an indictment for a grand
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.740]  jury. So I'm not saying we should
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.740]  short circuit any legal
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.740]  new process here.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.740]  Doc, it's great to have you here on
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.740]  Saturday. Everybody's tuning in. We're gonna give you the floor and it's
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.740]  amazing, but people need
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.740]  to hear this. So just digress because I don't want to go
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.740]  as a lawyer and a guy that you want to
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.740]  hit just the facts. But how
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.740]  did you 18, 19 months
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.740]  ago predict they bring out
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.740]  shots that didn't work, predict they'd have boosters,
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.740]  predict it would cause all these health
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.740]  problems and predict
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.740]  this breakdown? I mean, you were the first
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.740]  so we're
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.740]  always want to know what's coming next. So
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.740]  if you told us what was going to happen 18
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.740]  months ago and it came true,
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.740]  I want to focus on how we stop them. And I get
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.740]  that. But if we don't stop them or we don't take
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.740]  action or if legislators and prosecutors
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.740]  don't, what comes next? I mean,
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.740]  what is what is and I know as a
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.740]  prosecutor, you don't get into the mindset of the
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.740]  killer. We know they did it. So go
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.740]  after him. But for the public, they have to
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.740]  understand why somebody would do something like this. That's why
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.740]  so much. The public just can't believe this is happening.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.740]  Just like half the Germans live right
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.740]  next to death camps. They didn't believe that Hitler was killing
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.740]  people till they took them and Eisenhower made a look
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.740]  at the dead bodies. I mean, people just can't
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.740]  believe this is happening.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.740]  Excuse
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.740]  me. I understand. I mean, I'm
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.740]  here. So just what is the
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.740]  big picture? Because I know you want to focus on
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.740]  as a respected top lawyer and a guy
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.740]  that wrote the U.S. weapons law and former top
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.740]  U.N. prosecutor. You want to focus on what
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:20.740]  you can prove court law. People are listening. But just
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.740]  as a father, I've got four children as
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.740]  a person. I still can't
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.740]  wrap my mind around how you predicted
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.740]  all this. And I had other scientists on it as well.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.740]  It's all coming true like a nightmare.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.740]  And then you're getting censored and I'm
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.740]  getting censored. And what does Google think
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.740]  it's doing? What is the Democratic Party
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.740]  or Trump who hasn't come out against this? What
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.740]  do they think they're involved in? Because this is serious.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.740]  This isn't like old fashioned vaccines
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.740]  and had some side effects. This is
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.740]  devastating. This is premeditated.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.740]  Biden is going to
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.740]  recommend and they'll soon require
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.740]  a third round of
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.740]  Franken shots for everyone. So
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.740]  if if the first two didn't kill
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.740]  you, the third will get you for sure.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.740]  But Alex, what I've just
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.740]  outlined here is
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.740]  what I believe common
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.740]  ordinary everyday
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.740]  American citizens
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.740]  can do to fight back
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.740]  now. Go
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.740]  to your state's attorney, district
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.740]  attorney, county prosecutor,
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.740]  attorney general and
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.740]  demand they convene
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.740]  grand juries for both
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.740]  the Franken shots and
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.740]  the pandemic itself. I think
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.740]  this can be done. It should
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.740]  be done. And if we start
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.740]  doing it now, we
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.740]  will be fighting back. We will
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.740]  be resisting and we will
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.740]  be going after the perpetrators
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.740]  for sure. You're right. So go right
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.740]  at the fact that it violates the Nuremberg code.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.740]  They skipped all the trials up front.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.740]  This is insanity. Just attack
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.740]  it right at its base.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.740]  It's how to stop them.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.740]  Right. And I that's
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.740]  why I'm appearing here for
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.740]  you today
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.740]  to outline this dual
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.740]  legal strategy to go
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.740]  after the people behind the pandemic
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.740]  to hold them legally accountable
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.740]  on a state and local basis
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:12.740]  and also the
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.740]  Franken shots to hold
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.740]  those people legally accountable
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.740]  on a state and local basis.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.740]  And despite whatever
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.740]  civil immunity
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.740]  they might have, this is not
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.740]  going to protect them from criminal
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.740]  indictments for murder
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.740]  and conspiracy. And I get the fact
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.740]  you're only as a legal scholar going on what
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.740]  legally is happening. I get it. I'm asking you as
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.740]  an American, why do
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.740]  something so bold and so reckless
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.740]  when even the majority of
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.740]  top scientists say this is terrible and it cause
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.740]  all these problems. And now it's happening and they just
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.740]  keep bullying forward. Like, why
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.740]  would they do something so insanely
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.740]  aggressive and reckless?
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:59.620]  Well, because we haven't fought back yet, I'm here to explain how I think common, ordinary,
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.020]  everyday Americans can start to fight back.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:08.380]  Indeed, there are some states in the Union, I know Massachusetts is one, where people
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:14.220]  can go into court and file their own criminal complaints as well.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:23.380]  So if you have loved ones who have been killed, murdered, by either the pandemic or the frankenshots,
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:30.420]  you have a standing to go into the state's attorney, district attorney, county attorney
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:40.540]  and say, my loved one died in your jurisdiction, your jurisdiction here, it was murder, I want
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:45.620]  you to convene a grand jury and present the evidence to the grand jury.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:51.380]  Now, of course, maybe the grand jury will not agree, but I think both you and I conclude
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.860]  the evidence is out there.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:58.340]  It certainly is, so spend as much time as you want, Dr. Boyle, on that two-pronged approach
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.620]  to stop this with the criminal investigations, criminal indictments.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.860]  But then separately, the military has been begging for you to come on.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.940]  I appointed him at previous interviews, and I pointed him towards your letter in the Nuremberg
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:12.300]  Code, and it's being brought up at city council meetings in Texas and in California and other
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.500]  areas, your letter, but specifically to the military.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:20.660]  You helped twice get this infract shot suspended and expose the Gulf War illness, what was
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.780]  really going on.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:26.180]  So the military is calling me, and I'm not a lawyer, and I just point them at your interview,
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.100]  and I know nothing's perfect, but the Pentagon is saying, oh, well, if you have a exemption
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.220]  and they make it very hard to get the exemption, what is the real legal position for those
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:41.940]  in the military when they're trying to make them take this experimental injection?
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:51.460]  My advice is that under military law, you do not have any obligation to obey an illegal
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.460]  order.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:02:00.900]  I've been involved myself over the years, Alex, in defending pro bono publico, five
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:11.100]  G.I. resistors against war or torture or war crimes, and you have no obligation to obey
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:16.780]  an illegal order, which in this case would be a violation of the Nuremberg Code of Medical
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:21.740]  Experimentation to take these franken shots.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:30.700]  So of course you need to get yourself a lawyer, and we've discussed this before.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.180]  I dealt with JAG lawyers.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:37.780]  I mean no disrespect to JAG lawyers, but at the end of the day, they are in the chain
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.980]  of command.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.580]  There's only so much they can do for you.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.540]  So you'll need to get a lawyer.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:50.700]  You could get a retired JAG lawyer or JAG judge or civilian counsel willing to push
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:56.700]  the envelope for you and just invoke your rights in my Nuremberg notice and say I am
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:05.660]  not going to follow this order because it's an illegal order.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:13.820]  Now then what would happen is if they want to introduce court martial proceedings, you
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:20.060]  have enormous protections under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.460]  Now I'm just speaking my own personal experience.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:30.820]  Obviously it's not what we would expect as civilians, but I think our UCMJ is pretty
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:35.300]  good if you're a member of U.S. armed forces.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:42.020]  But you're going to need a lawyer to assert all of your rights under the Uniform Code
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.900]  of Military Justice.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:50.340]  Now the last I've read, there are at least 30 percent or more of members of U.S. armed
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:55.180]  forces who have so far not taken these frankensteins.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:02.300]  Well imagine if 30 percent of U.S. armed forces assert their right to disobey an illegal order
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:09.420]  in violation of the Nuremberg Code of Medical Experimentation and say I'm very sorry but
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.660]  I'm under military law.
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.780]  I have no obligation to obey an illegal order.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.740]  Then what is the military going to do?
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:24.900]  Are they going to court martial 30 percent of U.S. armed forces?
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.940]  I don't know.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:31.500]  But that would be the dilemma that the military would be in today.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:37.260]  Are they going to court martial 30 percent of U.S. armed forces or not?
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.900]  So I think you've hit the heart of the matter.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.060]  They wanted to get 80, 90 percent of the public to do this because they got about half the
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.220]  U.S. public, 70 percent of the military to do it.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:50.300]  They've got a real problem bullying a giant minority that also has a law on their side.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.300]  That's correct.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:05:01.580]  And so again if you want, I wrote a book protesting power, law, resistance and war, Rahman and
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:11.620]  Littlefield Inc. that has a case in there on failure to obey an illegal order.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.180]  And I want it.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.140]  This can be stopped because you don't ever tell the story to your horn.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.020]  Go back for me as you were on over 15 years ago, I remember reading the news articles
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.460]  how we first got you on.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:26.860]  You helped stop the experimental anthrax shot that killed tens of thousands of people.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.860]  They admit that.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.540]  So this is not your first rodeo here.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:39.740]  If you read my book, Protesting Power, War, Resistance and Law, I wrote that for lawyers
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:48.740]  to explain to them, to lawyers, how to use international law, the laws of war, U.S. constitutional
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:06:00.660]  law and human rights law to defend GI resistors as a matter of principle, GI resistors who
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:07.620]  have opposed illegal criminal wars or war crimes or torture or things of this nature
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.540]  or illegal orders.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.340]  It's all there in my book.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:18.540]  And so all your lawyers have to do is get a copy of that book and read through it.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.140]  And they'll know how to make out this type of defense.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:30.860]  I helped defend U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Jeff Patterson, who was the first military
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:38.140]  resistor to Bush Senior's war against Iraq.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:50.020]  And Corporal Patterson refused to go to Saudi Arabia in August, right after the Bush Senior
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:59.060]  was ordering U.S. armed forces to Saudi Arabia on the grounds that he believed this was just
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:03.780]  another U.S. war for oil, which was, of course, correct.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:13.420]  But in any event, we defended him on the grounds that the Bush Senior order to ship off to
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:22.100]  Saudi Arabia was not authorized by law because it violated the War Powers Clause of the Constitution
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:27.540]  and Congress's 1973 War Powers Resolution.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:33.420]  I was out there at Kanahoe Bay in Hawaii for the court martial.
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:41.340]  It took about three hours and the judge took the matter under advisement and Corporal Patterson
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.100]  was dismissed from the Marine Corps.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:52.460]  They did not want to go to the final court martial, to the formal court martial with
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.780]  the posture of that case.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.020]  So your experience is that people have decent counsel and they're on the right, usually
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.900]  they're able to exercise their freedom.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]  Right.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.500]  So I'm just saying these are very complicated issues.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:10.620]  Sure, you can't set up here in generalities and give people the one size fits all, back
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.420]  of the envelope thing to do.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.900]  You're just saying, here's the history of it, here's what I've done in the past and
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.940]  here's what you might want to look at.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.940]  Right.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:27.020]  I think the grounds are for military personnel to say, you know, I'm exercising my right
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:33.020]  under military law not to obey in a legal order that would clearly violate here the
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:37.700]  Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation to take these.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.180]  And is it the Nuremberg Code?
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.220]  That's storied in one of the most respected laws in the world.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.700]  That's so well known, even the general public knows that.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.220]  That's a pretty strong international agreement.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.220]  And that's bad.
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:50.620]  I know U.S. law then follows that.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.620]  Explain how that works.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.980]  But that's a very strong thing to hang your hat on, isn't it?
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.700]  Yes, of course.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:01.700]  And, you know, if it were to come to a court martial, I think we do quite well arguing
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.700]  that point.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:03.700]  Yes.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:09.540]  But the point is, we're talking about mass civil resistance here by 30 percent of the
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:14.660]  U.S. armed forces who don't want to take these Franken shots.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:18.900]  They're not doing their rights under U.S. military law and say, I'm not going to do
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.900]  it.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:25.640]  And then if they are court martial, they get civilian counsel and make these types of arguments
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:30.140]  that, you know, have successfully been made in military court martial.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.140]  Sure, sure.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.400]  Let me just digress, doctor, because this is an important professor.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.740]  It's just so interesting as you've been on my show probably 50, 60 times in the last
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.740]  15 years.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.980]  You never like to repeat yourself, but you did predict that the vaccine wouldn't work
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.700]  because you couldn't make one for a coronavirus, which they now admit.
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.140]  You did predict these attempts at the passports, the controls.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.220]  I mean, so so it's rare to get you to make predictions.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.380]  But you were here over a year and a half ago and predicted the world we live in now.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.380]  You can go wherever you want right now, but the listeners want to hear what you think's
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.860]  coming next if we don't oppose this, because I know you 99 percent of the time you want
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.900]  to do legalese and the actual facts of the cases.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.900]  You can talk about them.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:12.420]  But what do you see as an American, as a citizen about the world we live in right now?
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:18.540]  Well, we're going to be living under a medical dictatorship, a totalitarian dictatorship,
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.540]  for sure.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.180]  So we have to fight back.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:26.700]  And that's why I'm appearing here on your show today to give a strategy.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:33.380]  I've given three different strategies here, two for civilians on the pandemic and the
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:40.180]  Franken shots and one for the military on the Franken shots that they can use to fight
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.340]  back and resist the Franken shots.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.260]  Yes.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.260]  Wow.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.260]  OK, well, amazing.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:50.380]  So we've been talking here about 35 minutes, got about 30 minutes left with you and your
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.180]  time on the special Saturday show.
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:57.220]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle, wherever you want to go next, dealing with this medical tyranny
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.460]  you just talked about how we oppose it and what we can do.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.860]  I think you're saying it's time for the public to get informed and to start saying, no, it's
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:03.860]  really up to us.
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:10.100]  Well, I'm not just saying no, but to fight back legally, as I'm saying, I'm not saying,
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.460]  you know, take up arms here or anything like that.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:18.140]  But based on my experience, legally, this can be done.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.180]  It should be done.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:22.220]  I think we can succeed and we can fight back.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]  Yes.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.300]  Well, please continue then.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:33.500]  Well, that that's the strategy I had here, those three points I had one for the military,
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.820]  two for civilians.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:42.220]  We can control this resistance at a state and local government.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:49.220]  We do not have to rely on the federal government that is under the control of Biden.
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:52.380]  And he's working in cahoots with Fauci.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.340]  He's made that very clear.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:12:03.540]  And I myself, I've been up against Biden twice in my professional career in his capacity
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.220]  as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:13.820]  The first time I beat him out, the second time I stopped what he was doing and protected
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.180]  the interests of of my people.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.620]  You can't believe anything Biden's telling you.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:28.340]  My experience, he's very ruthless, cunning, despite the Uncle Joe type image, he's very
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:35.900]  ruthless, cunning, unprincipled and typical machine politician.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:43.660]  And we now see that in the tyranny of Biden imposing the Franken shots to whatever extent
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:54.060]  he can, and then also basically hijacking those in the private sector to impose these
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.540]  Franken shots.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:13:01.860]  So again, for our future, the future of our children, we have to resist the Franken shots
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:06.420]  and we have to fight back against the instigators of the pandemic.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:11.100]  Now, Dr. Boyle, I know because you don't have all the facts, I don't have all the facts.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.140]  You don't want to go there before we start this interview and I respect that.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.620]  But we've learned it's in the news.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:20.140]  Owen Schroyer has been indicted, they say, for being on the steps of the Capitol.
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.540]  He was with me on January 6.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.180]  We went up to try to stop it.
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.180]  We bullhorned it.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.180]  It's on record.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:26.820]  But that's so chilling.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.620]  I want to raise the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism of Joe Biden
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.700]  from June two and a half months ago.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:40.500]  And it says in here, you put up NBC graphics that are out of this, protesting COVID measures,
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.300]  any claims of election fraud, you have the full weight.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.700]  It says the Pentagon and CIA see you as the main terror threat.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.300]  You wrote books on this.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.300]  You warned of this.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.740]  You were put on a no-fly list yourself.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:57.940]  Now we see other people that are totally peaceful, Republicans and others, and liberal anti-war
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:00.860]  activists being put on a no-fly list again.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:01.860]  This is all going on.
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:08.180]  What do you, just as a citizen looking at this, make of this?
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.740]  Because I mean, I don't even know what to say about this.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.140]  I wake up, there's a top Reuters story, FBI finds scant evidence U.S. Capitol attack was
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.980]  coordinated, says Alex Jones and Roger Stone did not coordinate.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.900]  They've investigated me for six months, they subpoenaed us, they know that.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.340]  And then they indict Owen hours after this.
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:27.420]  I know you can't speak to that specifically, but what do you make in general of this move
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.660]  to declare protesting and the American people terrorism?
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:37.940]  To me, this sounds like the pages of 1984 have come true in the real world.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.940]  It's the next step.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:45.780]  As I said, I'm establishing a totalitarian dictatorship here in the United States.
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:52.660]  We do not need any type of domestic terrorism statute.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:15:04.140]  We have already enough statutes on the books to deal with whatever acts might be the case.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.980]  You're correct to point out this concept of domestic terrorism here in the United States
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:16.780]  would simply be used by the United States federal government to repress and persecute
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:25.100]  any type of dissent against United States government federal policies.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:35.740]  I listened to Attorney General Garland's speech on this, and he was completely disingenuous.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:45.340]  He tried to cover up the fact that the Levy guidelines still apply to the FBI.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.340]  They do not.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:53.380]  I think we've discussed this before on one of the many interviews we gave years ago.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:16:01.420]  The Levy guidelines were established by Attorney General Edward Harris Levy to try to stop
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:13.020]  FBI COINTEL operations, which, as you know, is basically infiltration of what otherwise
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:20.220]  might be peaceful law-abiding groups exercising their First Amendment and encourage them to
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:24.620]  commit illegal activities, agent provocateurs.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.220]  That's what COINTELPRO was all about.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:36.140]  That came out in the Watergate hearings, the church hearings, and all the scandals related
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:36.540]  to that.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.140]  President Ford appointed Levy.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:45.580]  Levy had been dean of the University of Chicago Law School when I was an undergrad there,
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.260]  so I followed this quite closely.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:56.140]  Levy adopted the Levy guidelines that were supposed to eliminate COINTELPRO.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:17:01.020]  I don't know if they did or they didn't, because I suspect the FBI was still out there
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:05.180]  in any event, but they did rein them in seriously.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:15.020]  Now, everyone knows after 9-11-2001, the Attorney General Ashcroft, who went to the University
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:21.900]  of Chicago Law School, probably when Levy was dean, revoked the Levy guidelines.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:30.940]  Everyone knows that, and the FBI was back into COINTELPRO operations officially,
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:36.300]  and they've been involved in COINTELPRO operations ever since.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:40.220]  And for those who don't know, COINTELPRO means harassing and setting up citizens.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.260]  You're the legal scholar, but how would you define COINTELPRO in one line?
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:52.060]  Oh, spying, agent provocateur, entrapment, whatever.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.700]  It's basically war on domestic political opposition.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.300]  That's correct.
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:05.340]  All right, so Garland, in his speech, covered for the FBI and said, well, as we all know,
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:11.180]  the FBI has been adhering to the Levy guidelines since they were promulgated.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.220]  That's a total lie.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:19.020]  Everyone knows that Ashcroft repudiated the Levy guidelines, and the FBI has been involved
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:25.580]  in COINTELPRO operations ever since Ashcroft, after 9-11, repudiated them.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:34.220]  They've inflicted massive COINTELPRO operations on Muslims all over the United States.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:41.820]  And this is not to excuse any type of violent activity here.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.100]  100%, I'm all against it.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:49.580]  It's just that I'm experiencing them setting me up and my friends and family in lifetime,
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.580]  but I had nothing to do with it, so I'm not placing myself as a victim, but I'm
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.260]  really starting to enjoy a little bit of what Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy and others,
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:03.020]  I guess, were enjoying because to have this agency literally up my rear end constantly,
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.700]  hovering over me, trying to set me up, it's just outrageous.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:08.700]  Right.
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:12.540]  Well, as I told you before, they put me on all the U.S.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:19.580]  government's terrorist watch list because I refused to become an informant for the FBI and
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:25.900]  the CIA and my Arab and Muslim clients in violation of their constitutional rights.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.060]  For those that don't know, they came and visited, didn't they?
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.060]  You never like to repeat something you said once, but they came and visited you and you
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.340]  wouldn't do it, so they came after you.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.980]  Well, they came right to my office in the law school, right?
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:43.820]  I mean, can you believe that agents of the FBI and the CIA come to the office of a law
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.100]  professor at a law school?
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.020]  They've come to this office off record before.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.220]  Yeah, they did the same thing here.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:49.580]  Right.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:20:01.260]  So but the point is, domestic terrorism is being used to oppose any resistance to what
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.220]  the United States federal government might want to do.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.220]  We don't need any domestic terrorism statute.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.860]  This is just, as you said, Orwellian.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:21.740]  Even after the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, as a result of the bombing
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:27.100]  of the Murrah federal building, there was more than enough on the books there to deal
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.940]  with domestic terrorism.
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:38.380]  And then after 9-11, 2001, they adopted the USA Patriot Act, which basically set up an
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:42.540]  American police state, which is what we live under today.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.740]  There's no question about it.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:50.220]  Indeed, I've lectured to lawyers on the USA Patriot Act.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.380]  And so this will be the next step.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:21:01.100]  Domestic terrorism to use to go after peaceful, nonviolent American citizens, left, right,
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:07.820]  middle, exercising their First Amendment rights to oppose whatever policies the United States
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.820]  federal government is engaged in.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:17.420]  Like today, the Franken shots, this is domestic terrorism and we will have to prosecute them.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:17.920]  Right.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.520]  All right.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.840]  We've got you here on this emergency broadcast.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.360]  Millions are going to watch it.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.720]  And I just want to shut up then for 10 minutes, Dr. Boyle, just in the main, what you want
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:36.080]  to say about America, the world, Afghanistan, China, geopolitics, just anything that you
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.080]  want to impart to viewers and listeners.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:38.960]  People really respect you.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.040]  They want to hear from you on that.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.720]  And then just answer my question.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.680]  I don't like to speculate, but sometimes you do do it.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.560]  It's been very accurate.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.880]  You said this was a very deadly virus and I thought it was real as well.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.040]  But I looked at the statistics and the numbers weren't that high.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.880]  Now I can tell you that I personally have people that I know that have died.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.920]  I have everybody I know who knows people that have died.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.240]  My mother and father right now are literally fighting for their lives.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.240]  Almost everybody else I know is sick.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.360]  The hospitals are all completely full and it's all variants.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.920]  And the scientists I talked to, the experts I talked to have been very, very clear that
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.840]  it's sloughing and mutants out of this GMO live virus.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.520]  Just like with the polio vaccine, it causes shedding.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.400]  And so that's the best numbers we've got is that this is you're right.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.280]  It was a real virus.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.720]  Very bad out of Wuhan.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.080]  And you said that 18 months ago.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.840]  Now it's just I talked to the hospitals.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.720]  I talked to medical doctors.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.080]  I was just talking to one while you were talking.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.680]  This is a real bio attack.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.120]  I've talked to my Pentagon sources.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.480]  They've all confirmed it.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.080]  And this year is it looks like five times worse than
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.280]  where we were last summer at this time as we're about to go into the fall.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.320]  I mean, I'm a guy that's a tough guy, but I'm scared.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.080]  I mean, I'm really shook up right now.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.080]  I know how serious this is.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.880]  Almost everyone I know in the last two months has been sick.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.280]  Some people, like I said, I'm not getting better in two, three weeks.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.480]  So that's your lawyer and a scholar.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.240]  But just in general, looking at this and what they've done and in the Fauci
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.000]  and we know it was made in the lab and we know they let's start there.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.520]  What is it like to be vindicated?
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.440]  And everything you said 17, 18, 19 months ago has come true.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.040]  Peter Daszak on video saying, yeah, we were developing a vaccine.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.480]  We can bind five viruses.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.760]  You already have their documents.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.880]  They didn't hide it.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.320]  And then the lying to Congress.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.520]  And then they get away with it because I'm not I'm not a homicidal person.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.440]  I'm a loving guy and I'm not going to kill anybody.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.000]  I'm just saying I'd like the courts to arrest these people.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.480]  I like to see them on death row.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.840]  They are assaulting us.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.160]  And I feel like a coward and a pathetic worm sitting here taking it.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.040]  So I feel better getting you on to talk about the legal parameters here.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.520]  So that's a lot I just threw out there.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.200]  What do you want to take that?
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:52.480]  Right.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:24:00.800]  Well, Alex, I remember at the very beginning of our conversations, I did mention how lethal
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.440]  I thought the Wuhan coronavirus was.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.560]  I said it was about in the area 15 percent.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.000]  I noticed that in his last interchange with Dr.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:23.280]  Fauci, Senator Ron Paul also said 15 percent definitely listening to you because you've
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.000]  got the best info.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:24.480]  So continue.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.920]  Well, I don't know if Senator Paul is listening to me or not.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.880]  As you know, Senator Paul is a medical doctor.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.440]  He's an ophthalmologist.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.360]  That's a highly specialized area of medicine board certified.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.240]  He explains in that last confrontation that he was first going to be basically a pathologist
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.560]  and then went into eye surgery for money.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.480]  So his original training is in all that.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.160]  Right.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.120]  So Senator Paul said 15 percent.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.680]  And that's what I said originally.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.160]  And I know one of your colleagues there said, well, he thought that was an exaggeration.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.160]  But this is extremely dangerous.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:04.640]  Yes.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.400]  And we have to treat it that way.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:15.360]  And again, that's why I appear here on your show today to come up with three different
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.280]  strategies for fighting back here.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:24.160]  One, the indictment state and local basis against Fauci and Collins and Barak and the
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.040]  rest of them for murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:35.120]  Second, a separate indictment against Slaoui and the chief executive officers there at
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:43.760]  Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson for murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:49.760]  And then the third legal strategy for the members of our U.S. armed forces, now the
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:54.400]  30 percent or so who don't want to take the Franken shots.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.560]  So we're all in this together.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.640]  We have to fight back together.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:04.880]  Yes, we also have to resist this whole concept of domestic terrorism that is going to be
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.800]  turned against all of us.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.160]  I mean, as far as the U.S.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.960]  government is concerned, I'm a domestic terrorist.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:22.880]  When I applied to get out my Social Security benefits, I filled out the form online.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.680]  No problem.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.360]  And what happened?
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:32.400]  I got a call from the Social Security agency up there in Chicago saying, well, you're on
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:39.680]  the computer alert system here and you are going to have to go into a personal interview
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.440]  to Social Security down here in Champaign.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:50.400]  So I had to go in there to a personal interview for about an hour and convince the Social
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.160]  Security agent that I was not a terrorist.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.040]  I kid you not.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.640]  This is what is going on in in this country.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.440]  If they've done this to me, you can imagine what they're going to do to you.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.640]  We have to fight back.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.360]  We have to stop the pandemic.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.400]  We have to stop the Franken shots.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:18.320]  We must stop the further development of a totalitarian police state that is clearly
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.960]  coming under the guise of this medical tyranny.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.960]  I mean, you can just listen to Fauci.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.800]  He's he always speaks up out of both sides of his mouth.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.640]  I mean, Senator Paul and I want to go.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.440]  I want to get back to that.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.120]  But what you said here a year ago over here, he said we're in a two front war.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.360]  Now I think we're in a three front war.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.080]  What was the two fronts you said like 15 months ago?
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.760]  The two front war was the pandemic and the Franken shots.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.720]  And now I'd say it's this whole notion of domestic terrorism.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:50.960]  Right.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:57.600]  As I said, we don't need any concept of domestic terrorism here in the United States.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.360]  We do not need a law.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.000]  There are more than enough laws on the books.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:12.240]  My guess is that under the currently operative COINTELPRO, the FBI has everyone
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.280]  infiltrated up the kazoo in any way.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.480]  Oh, listen, listen.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.520]  I wake up this morning at five thirty and I go to Google alerts and there's my name
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.240]  and it says Jones cleared and then I get a call by one of my crew members going,
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.760]  hey, they went and visited a lady I know who I don't even know.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.840]  And they were asking her about me three days ago.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.880]  So I know you as a lawyer don't want to get into the facts.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.680]  I don't either.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.560]  It's just bizarre to be like top news story Jones cleared and then oh, and no criminal
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.200]  record, former sports broadcaster, Mr.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.680]  America is indicted for being there with me.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.440]  I mean, he was there with me.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.320]  We didn't do anything.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.160]  We tried to stop it on video.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.880]  So I'm not even scared because I'm innocent.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.080]  It's a very weird feeling like when I'm going 70 in a 60.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.760]  Oh, God, there's a compliment ticket.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.880]  I am sorry.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.920]  I take the ticket.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.280]  I it's a weird feeling, Dr.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.480]  Boyle and law as a human to have not done anything wrong and actually not have fear.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.160]  It's more of just like sadness for the country.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.360]  Like, really?
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.080]  You've indicted Owen for being a journalist outside the Capitol.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.400]  Who was I know I just I'm I'm just freaked out for that.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.840]  I can't believe America's turned into this.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:32.320]  Well, to give an example, when the FBI and the CIA came to interrogate me in my own office,
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:38.800]  the first question was, why are you giving all these interviews all over the world?
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.840]  So much for the First Amendment, right?
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.040]  They couldn't care less.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.200]  You know, the problem was, was your what was your was your positions?
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:48.640]  Right.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.560]  And I feel it's preposterous.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.320]  They didn't care about the First Amendment.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.840]  They didn't care about the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment,
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.800]  the Seventh Amendment.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.720]  It just in my case alone.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.480]  This is what we're dealing with.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.920]  The FBI is completely out of anyone's control.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:06.640]  Whatever.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.520]  Let me just tell you the story, because with you, they were at least up front.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.600]  And this is happening like seven or eight times where it's a national TV host or an
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.440]  international newspaper editor.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.240]  They want to interview.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.840]  They go, let's go to dinner.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.720]  And I don't do this anymore after the last time this happened was like eight years ago
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.440]  and I quit doing it.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:22.800]  And you're at dinner.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.160]  They make sure your phone's not on.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:24.800]  They go, listen.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:29.600]  I'm really here with the CIA and we just want you to stop this right now.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.880]  We can really work with you.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.560]  Another time it was a Mossad agent.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.560]  Another time it was the FBI.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.920]  And later, like they had people contact me about, hey, you can do what we said.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.920]  And then when I do what they said, bad things happen.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.840]  But I mean, it's like the mafia.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.440]  And so I just I just it's like I guess most people, Dr.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.360]  Boyle, will put ourselves in the club that doesn't.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.120]  We get those visits and don't roll over.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.440]  Can you imagine how many Americans and I don't blame them.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.840]  Don't know how to deal with stuff like that.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.640]  Well, that's correct.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.960]  You should never meet with any of these people without having a lawyer with you.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.920]  That's correct.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:05.920]  Because they don't tell you they tell you they tell you they're the editor of the Atlantic
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.240]  or they there you go or they tell you they're with, you know, Vanity Fair or whatever.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.360]  And then they're really inoperative.
[01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:26.310]  Sure. After 9-11, 2001, there had been before then a presidential order that covert agents
[01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:32.030]  should not be members of the press or working with the press or things of that nature. And
[01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:39.470]  after 9-11, 2001, Bush Jr. lifted that order. So yeah, you have to understand you're dealing
[01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:43.390]  with media. You could be dealing with some type of covert agent. That's correct.
[01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:50.110]  You know, the weird thing is they're playing spy harassing a prominent, respected lawyer
[01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:54.910]  or a talk show host. We're just normal people. I mean, you've got a PhD that hardly anybody else
[01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:59.630]  has. You're a special guy. But it's like they think just because they're in the CIA or the FBI,
[01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:04.430]  we're supposed to be a doormat to them like we don't have any rights. And I've even saw Saki say,
[01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:10.110]  oh, U.S. citizens don't get priority out of Kabul. They've got to pay money, but others don't.
[01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:14.430]  Where is this pissing on Americans, too? I just why do they do that?
[01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:23.390]  Well, I guess they just don't care, Alex. They have all the power and they figure they can get
[01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:29.630]  away with it. And that's that's what's happening. But the real danger is here now are the Franken
[01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:35.630]  shots that Biden's now going to they will recommend and soon they're going to require
[01:32:35.630 --> 01:32:40.030]  a third round of Franken shots for everyone that that's going to kill a lot of people off
[01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:45.470]  that they haven't killed off already. And remember, based on my experience,
[01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:52.990]  having defended pro bono publico Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn, who refused to give the
[01:32:52.990 --> 01:33:01.550]  Franken shots in go for one out of five hundred thousand. And these are ballpark figures because
[01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:07.150]  the Pentagon still lies about them because they know they committed a Nuremberg crime on our own
[01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:13.390]  troops. But out of five hundred thousand troops inoculated, eleven thousand were killed,
[01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:21.470]  one hundred thousand were disabled. And those were healthy young men and women in U.S. armed
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:27.630]  forces. So you can extrapolate from there what a third round of these Franken shots are going to
[01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:34.590]  do to people. The go for sickness produced the the first set of Franken shots. We're already seeing
[01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:45.390]  massive adverse reactions to the current covid Franken shots. And it's just begun. Indeed,
[01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:53.710]  as I said before, it took me two years to figure out that the go for Franken shots
[01:33:54.590 --> 01:34:01.630]  had produced this humanitarian catastrophe known as the go for syndrome, the go for sickness.
[01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:13.070]  And those Franken shots also they infected health care workers and next of kin that and members.
[01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:18.750]  Sorry. And yeah, members of the family. And that indicated there was a biological warfare
[01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:26.510]  agent at work, probably going back to those first go for Franken shots. So I'm I'm afraid
[01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:33.150]  certainly in the next two years, if we don't stop these Franken shots now,
[01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:39.070]  who knows how many will die and how many will be disabled?
[01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.510]  I'm
[01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:43.390]  about to say it here on Saturday, and I appreciate your time, but Boyle,
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:47.870]  that thank God you and others were able to stop the experimental anthrax shots before.
[01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:53.070]  So we should be able to do it now. The numbers vary from the swine flu vaccine that killed 20
[01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:58.270]  or 30 people. They debated, but they suspended that over a few deaths. But already the deaths
[01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:03.310]  in the VAERS reporting system is in the tens of thousands. And so I just again wonder why
[01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:10.510]  they're doing this exercise of power. I think it is all they're going for broke, Alex. I think
[01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:17.390]  that's all we can say that's going on here. This is a massive push by the financial elite,
[01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:23.230]  the power elite, and they're going for all the power. This is it. Absolutely. You never you
[01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:26.750]  plugged one of your books finally, and I've read three or four of them. But how do people find
[01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:30.190]  your books that you've written? So many people really should read them, especially lawyers out
[01:35:30.190 --> 01:35:37.470]  there. Well, you can just hit my name on Google or Amazon and all the books will come out.
[01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:44.190]  But for the members of U.S. armed forces and their lawyers, the important book is
[01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:53.150]  protesting power, war, resistance and law. And it explains how to make these arguments in U.S.
[01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:58.350]  military court martial proceedings. It's basically written for lawyers,
[01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:05.630]  but you can read it on your own. And certainly if 30 percent of U.S. armed forces just say,
[01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:14.510]  I'm not taking the Franken shots, I have a right under U.S. military law to resist an illegal order.
[01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:21.470]  And, you know, if you're going to court martial me, so be it. And then you proceed to exercise
[01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:27.630]  all the rights you have under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Well, if 30 percent of U.S.
[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:33.790]  armed forces do that, the whole system will break down. Yeah, even if 10 percent did. All right.
[01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:36.830]  And again, we're going to post this interview is going out Saturday evening. We're going to post
[01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:41.710]  an archive of this at info wars dot com and free world news dot TV. We'll put the Nuremberg code
[01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:49.550]  up there and the short, very simple and sweet letter also that Dr. Boyle has put out for folks,
[01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:55.230]  because that is very, very important, letting people know the basics of their right. As usual,
[01:36:55.230 --> 01:36:59.150]  thank you for joining us. I hope you had a great vacation. It's good to have you back, Dr. Boyle,
[01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:04.830]  and to have a rest this weekend. Thank you so much. Well, thanks for having me on, Alex. And
[01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:12.030]  to get the message out to all of my fellow American citizens who are in dire danger now
[01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:22.990]  from these Franken shots, we must resist. And also the members of our military who also are in
[01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:28.990]  great danger here. They have to resist, too. Thank you, Dr. Boyle. We salute you. God bless.
[01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:35.870]  Thank you. You, too, Alex. All right. So here I am and I'm not a drama queen, but I am somebody
[01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:38.990]  that's theatrical because I really care about what I'm saying. I believe what I'm saying.
[01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:42.510]  I am literally surrounded at this point. And that's OK, because they're coming after our
[01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:45.630]  veterans are coming after our troops, are coming after our children with these deadly
[01:37:45.630 --> 01:37:50.110]  Franken shots. Dr. Boyle just eloquently laid out. I mean, Owen has been indicted
[01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:58.590]  for being at the Capitol with me on January 6. And you have a separate huge announcement by the FBI
[01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:07.950]  that, oh, Owen Schroyer or Alex Jones and Roger Stone didn't say, oh, and Trump weren't involved
[01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:12.510]  planning that. Of course we weren't. It totally destroyed us wanting to have an investigation of
[01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:19.230]  the election. So we're going to come back in a moment and I'm going to get Owen in here with us
[01:38:19.230 --> 01:38:27.310]  in studio because he's reporting to jail on Monday. And they are that they've indicted him.
[01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:34.030]  And so that's where we are in this country. That's where this world is. And I'm a tough guy.
[01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:41.630]  I can handle this. I'm sad for America that I know Owen was with me in D.C. and had no plan
[01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:47.070]  to attack the Capitol and was with us with me the whole time and did nothing wrong. And they have
[01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:52.350]  indicted him. And absolutely, that is a message to me. And I don't know what the message is.
[01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:55.790]  Our government's run by criminals already know that. I mean, I don't know what you're supposed
[01:38:55.790 --> 01:39:00.270]  to like. I'm not giving up. I'm not going away. What am I supposed to do? Join your war crimes?
[01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:05.070]  Join your poison shots? Join Fauci and kill a bunch of kids? I mean, at a certain point,
[01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:08.910]  you people are crazy. I'm talking to the system, but they're not going to stop. I get it. They're
[01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:14.830]  a hierarchical system that follows orders just like the damn Nazis did. And it's a shame.
[01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:21.390]  It is a shame. So I'm going to drag Owen in here. We're going to get his take on this before we
[01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:25.550]  have to put him in jail. And they'll probably throw him under the D.C. jail. They'll probably
[01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:30.110]  diesel him around the country. He'll probably die in there. They've already got people in
[01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:35.790]  there for seven damn months that didn't even raise a hand to the police. Sure. The people
[01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:39.150]  that beat up a few cops give them five years in prison. They don't even give them a trial.
[01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:44.190]  Their trial dates have now been canceled. So I'm getting ready to send Owen Schroyer,
[01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:50.990]  my good personal friend of five years, to a damn gulag. And I feel dirty as an American.
[01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:55.630]  I love our country, but I tell you, I am disgusted right now. I appreciate Dr.
[01:39:55.630 --> 01:39:58.910]  Bull coming on with us. We're going to go to break. We're going to drag Owen in here.
[01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:02.270]  I appreciate the crew. And this could be our last show any day. I don't know how long we're going to
[01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:07.790]  be on air this country. This is this is historical stuff happening, folks. All right. Thank you so
[01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:12.590]  much. We'll be right back after the break. The purpose of fear is to call us into action.
[01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:18.190]  And there is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:22.830]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an
[01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:28.350]  invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of
[01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:33.950]  having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than
[01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:39.310]  nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening
[01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:43.470]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But there is only two things to do.
[01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:48.830]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awakened from
[01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:54.830]  the cult spell, then we win. But even when we win and we eventually will, the days of convenience
[01:40:54.830 --> 01:41:00.590]  are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:09.390]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:16.590]  So here we are on this special Saturday evening transmission with a thought criminal, Owen Schroyer,
[01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:22.510]  who's supposed to report to jail or his federal prison on Monday, just a few days away,
[01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:29.390]  for being with us peacefully for Trump's speech on January 6 and then going to the capital and
[01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:33.550]  trying to stop what happened there. I'm so blown away. So many people are blown away.
[01:41:34.190 --> 01:41:41.150]  We had a big article on InfoWareStore.com breaking InfoWare's host Owen Schroyer charge
[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:47.470]  for peacefully standing on steps near Capitol building. Owen, we can all laugh at this,
[01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:51.710]  but this is not a joking matter. I know you can't get into too many details, but you were there with
[01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:56.590]  me that day. You did nothing wrong. What do you make of this? Well, let me just first say this,
[01:41:56.590 --> 01:42:00.590]  because I know millions of people are going to be watching this anytime you do a special report.
[01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:06.910]  You know, Alex is doing this with a heavy heart and teary eyes today, folks. We won't get into why,
[01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:12.110]  but we're in the heart of this war. I mean, we're in the throes of this war right now. It's getting
[01:42:12.110 --> 01:42:19.870]  really too real, quite frankly. But to digress from that, it's kind of hard to sit here seven
[01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:26.110]  months after this event and think that we're still supposed to be panicked over all the lies we're
[01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:32.110]  being told about January 6th, but Biden does a television interview and he says, oh, that was
[01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:36.110]  four days ago in Afghanistan. Don't worry about that. That was four days ago. Just discount that,
[01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:40.750]  but they're still focused. People falling off airplanes just four days ago. They have almost
[01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:45.310]  600 people in jail right now that were in DC on January 6th, being held as political prisoners,
[01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:49.390]  being tortured, some of them. They're still planning on going after more. I think that
[01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:53.230]  that's very indicative that this move was made against me so late in the game. I think that
[01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:55.950]  they're just going through, getting more people lined up.
[01:42:56.830 --> 01:43:01.390]  I was about to ask. I mean, obviously, it's totally... Why would they announce Roger Stone,
[01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:05.630]  Alex Jones didn't premeditate an attack on Capitol, which we all know, you're with me,
[01:43:05.630 --> 01:43:09.470]  totally peaceful, doing nothing wrong. They invite you. I mean, what is that?
[01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:14.190]  I don't know. I don't know. There's obviously something else. There's obviously some other
[01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:20.430]  nefarious stuff going on that I could point out. I won't do it today, but I think that there's some
[01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:25.870]  other stuff going on that is kind of odd that I think this is the way it's happening. It's the
[01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:31.230]  same story every time when stuff like this happens to us and we bring in lawyers to handle it.
[01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:34.750]  Every time they look at a case and they're like, okay, they take it at face value with all their
[01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:40.110]  experience of being lawyers and cases they've researched and cases that they've settled and
[01:43:40.110 --> 01:43:44.430]  they think, okay, it's going to go like this. It never goes like that. It's always a different
[01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:49.630]  story when we're involved. There's always crooks and crannies and crevices and back doors and
[01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:58.750]  chutes and ladders. It's always some way just handled differently. Lawyers getting involved in
[01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:03.310]  this stuff and they're like, wow, this is odd. Why is it happening this way, this case with you? Why
[01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:06.430]  is this happening? Why is that happening? How could this be? This doesn't make sense.
[01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:10.670]  I think that this is going to be a lot of the same, but that day, Alex,
[01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:19.390]  I mean, it's a blessing. It'd be impossible to find the police that we talked to that day,
[01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:27.950]  but from the minute that we had body cams. From the minute we got on the Capitol area,
[01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:33.070]  you started telling people to stand down. The second we got on there, you got up on stacks
[01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:38.430]  of chairs. You said, we can't do this. Stand down. Don't go in. In the indictment that says,
[01:44:39.150 --> 01:44:43.150]  Jones tries to stop attack of Capitol and you're behind me and they go, look, it's Owen.
[01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:49.070]  As you were pointing out, I'm silent during all of this. I'm just going with you because
[01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:54.030]  we have a security detail. DC is insane. I can't break out of the security detail.
[01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:57.150]  There's millions of people everywhere. I'm sticking with the security detail. I'm sticking
[01:44:57.150 --> 01:45:01.950]  with you. You're getting up on steps. You're telling people to stand down, leave the building.
[01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:05.790]  At one point in time, we tried to actually multiple times, but there's one point in time
[01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:08.670]  where we tried to work with the Capitol police and the Capitol police said, look,
[01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:12.430]  why don't you go up onto these steps with the bullhorn and see if you can't shout people down.
[01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:15.550]  We have that footage. That's what you're indicted for is going on the steps.
[01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:18.910]  Yeah. Again, it's just a picture of me standing there.
[01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:24.750]  Literally just standing there. That's what they're claiming my offense is. Then again,
[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:28.430]  there's some other stuff that's boiled into this that is very odd as well.
[01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:32.110]  We haven't shown that footage. I don't know if the crew has it, but you went when they said
[01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:35.950]  nobody can demonstrate except that they were like Black Lives Matter. You wore a tape over
[01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:40.910]  your mouth. You got arrested and that type of stuff. They're using that as the excuse.
[01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:46.270]  Here's the footage. Well, he was ordered not to be on the Capitol. You weren't in the Capitol.
[01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:51.310]  They say you were in the Capitol disrupting. No, you were not in the Capitol. You were standing
[01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:56.670]  there with me. And by the way, that's that's just more weirdness of old cases that are still
[01:45:56.670 --> 01:46:00.910]  lingering against me that you can't even get through the system that if it wasn't for all
[01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:05.070]  the COVID crap would already be off the system anyway. All this would have been off the docket
[01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:09.390]  years ago if it wasn't for. And again, right here in this footage from give us the day.
[01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:16.990]  This is literally when they let code pink throw pain on people and block elevators.
[01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:20.590]  This is you arrested for no reason. Oh, there's all kinds of videos of the the
[01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:25.470]  arrest Trump people and impeach 45 people and everything from inside Capitol buildings and
[01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:30.030]  inside government buildings. And they're allowed to stage their massive protests. But
[01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:33.790]  one guy with a piece of tape over his mouth. And let me just say this is how they're using
[01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:39.070]  that, though. They say that the indictment like, well, he was here before. So now he's out on the
[01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:43.230]  grass. Well, we got to like, you know, well, and and here's the thing, and I won't go too much
[01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:48.430]  into the new developments, but but they tried to ban me from D.C. entirely and they couldn't get
[01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:53.790]  a judge to do that. So they wrote this weird language up basically saying, well, you can't
[01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:58.030]  be on the Capitol, but you can be on the Capitol. So it's kind of like an entrapment type of thing,
[01:46:58.030 --> 01:47:02.830]  it looks like because I'm a journalist. And so you can't tell a journalist that he can't do his job.
[01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:10.270]  But to insinuate whether Alex Jones or Owen Troyer was in D.C. or whether Alex Jones or
[01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:15.150]  Owen Troyer ever said anything about January 6th, it all would have gone the same way. Everybody
[01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:18.430]  still would have been there. Trump still would have been there. The millions of people still
[01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:23.070]  would have been there. And so that's what they're also trying to do here is say, oh, look, it was
[01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:26.750]  actually in force. They couldn't pin it on Trump. They wanted to pin it on Trump. They still are.
[01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:30.590]  They couldn't do it. So now that just looks like they're moving down the ladder, moving down to
[01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:33.630]  find other people. Who can we blame this on? But why would they put out a statement,
[01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:38.990]  Alex Jones, Trump and Roger Stone did not preplan it, which we know is true. My God,
[01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:42.430]  that just destroyed our plan to have a peaceful investigation by the Senate.
[01:47:43.150 --> 01:47:46.510]  And then they go, but oh, the same day, let's indict Owen Troyer.
[01:47:47.230 --> 01:47:53.390]  I don't know. It certainly seems like an odd coincidence. If you could even believe that it's
[01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:59.230]  a coincidence, I don't think that many people would. But the timing of this is very odd. Again,
[01:47:59.230 --> 01:48:03.710]  not just the eight months later, a factor of it, but yeah, the fact that they just,
[01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:07.950]  let's talk about this. It's in, it's meant to intimidate the crew up here. They think at an
[01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:11.950]  animal level like this makes the crew want to cut and run. Does the crew want to cut and run after
[01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:16.350]  this? You guys want to like roll over now? And I don't think you do think you're like me. This,
[01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:21.550]  this pisses you off more, but Oh, and talk about what you're facing. You're supposed to turn
[01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:27.550]  yourself in on Monday. Yeah. So a Monday is a, I think that the time they said was if I don't turn
[01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:33.470]  myself in by 11 a.m. Monday, that, uh, I guess that would result in the warrant being given to,
[01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:38.350]  I don't know whoever, if they wanted to come swat. Okay. Well turn yourself into like six or seven
[01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:42.670]  because Tucker Carlson is going to want to interview you before then. Well, uh, hopefully
[01:48:42.670 --> 01:48:47.150]  get that interview in first. Yeah. Already you were on show tonight. Couldn't these, you know,
[01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:51.390]  but uh, yeah, hopefully, uh, I don't know what, I don't know what's really looming here. There's
[01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:55.950]  a lot of, there's a lot of questions still. This all came down today. Obviously we've been busy.
[01:48:55.950 --> 01:49:02.190]  I've been on the show. Um, by the way, I've kind of bashed on you a little bit. You were like,
[01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:06.990]  let's wait till Trump drives the Capitol. And I'm like, no, no, it's already going on. Let's go to
[01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:12.030]  the Capitol. And once we got there, the provocateurs had already attacked and gone in,
[01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:16.510]  but you, you, you were like wanting to wait back for Trump and go with Trump. Well, we were,
[01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:21.950]  cause I mean, we've talked about this a little bit on air. After we left the ellipsis, we were
[01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:26.750]  standing outside, uh, the, the area around these barricades for maybe five or 10 minutes.
[01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:29.870]  And we were debating, okay, how do we want to do this? Do we want to go up this street? You want
[01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:34.590]  to go up this street? When do we want to go? And um, I mean, my, my, my point of view at the time
[01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:39.630]  was, Hey, let's wait for Trump. Let's get behind Trump and have him lead this. And, and you, I
[01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:43.710]  think at your time, the instincts, your spidey senses were going off like, Hey, we need to be
[01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:48.430]  there to try to stop anything bad from happening. Uh, you know, stop, stop from any setup from
[01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:52.190]  happening. And so that's what I said too. Yeah, you did. And so we kind of ended up in kind of
[01:49:52.190 --> 01:49:56.990]  this middle ground position. And then we stopped just outside. Yeah, that's the footage right there.
[01:49:57.710 --> 01:50:03.470]  And by the way, there's also, I w we'll see how this all goes, but there's footage that I think
[01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:08.350]  may be brought up here where it's, we're not even on Capitol grounds. There's certain areas called
[01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:12.110]  considered Capitol grounds or the Capitol buildings. And it's, uh, you know, it's,
[01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:17.230]  it's all up for interpretation, I suppose. But we're talking about we're like a half a mile or
[01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:24.110]  a mile down before we even March. And they're saying, Oh, look, this is, this is them. This
[01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:28.510]  is Owen Troyer up here leading the March on Capitol ground, not on Capitol ground. Again,
[01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:32.510]  there were already hundreds of thousands of people at the Capitol. Sure. Everyone knows
[01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:38.830]  it's asinine. So the fact that they would say we did not purposely attack the Capitol today,
[01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:43.390]  and then indict you, I think that's a civil war of the system. But I think that's the no brainer
[01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:49.550]  answer. Well, I hope that there are good people inside the system that are fighting. I hope there
[01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:53.710]  are, but they're going to serve you up to a DC judge and we're going to support you full best
[01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:58.110]  lawyers, everything, you know, they're feeding you and right in the same place. I'm going brother.
[01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:03.390]  Yeah. And, and Roger shows their arrogance, man, like you literally didn't do anything
[01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:08.110]  and tried to stop the riot. And now they've indicted you. I mean, that is like chutzpah,
[01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:12.190]  man. That's where we're at though, Alex. I mean that, that at the end of the day,
[01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:16.670]  that's really where we're at. When we talk about being in an info war, we talked about being when
[01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:22.110]  freedom fells, the best men rot in filthy jails. And those that cry to peace appeased are hung by
[01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:27.150]  those that tried to police. And you can take a look at, you know, whether it's a legal case here
[01:51:27.150 --> 01:51:32.510]  at info wars or whether it's what's going on with all the medical tyranny. That's totally illegal.
[01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:36.990]  I mean, I guess my biggest mistake, Alex, was I shouldn't have been in DC on January 6th. I should
[01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:41.870]  have been in DC on June 20, 2020, burning buildings and assaulting Capitol officers.
[01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:47.790]  I mean, if I came on air and I said, Hey, I was in Washington, DC on June 21st, 2020,
[01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:53.230]  and I burned a statue and I attacked five Capitol police officers and I assaulted five
[01:51:53.230 --> 01:51:56.750]  more rows would bail you out tomorrow. Oh, I wouldn't even have to worry about. And that's
[01:51:56.750 --> 01:52:02.670]  the thing. If we did call for war, people would be there, but we didn't because we understand it's
[01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:07.870]  all trap. Well, and that's what's so frustrating about this too. It's almost as if, if we could
[01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:11.790]  have foreseen this better and we have the best foresight here in info wars, I would say,
[01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:15.230]  and we didn't even see this, this set up coming, but if we could have foreseen it better, we could
[01:52:15.230 --> 01:52:19.150]  have, we could have laid it out much better and said, Hey, look, it's already out there. It's just
[01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:24.110]  a matter of the breadcrumbs. It's like the whole purpose was that they were going to launch a
[01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:28.990]  congressional investigation and they were going to do a congressional review of the election.
[01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:34.030]  That's what we were there for. We literally wanted that process. That was the entire purpose
[01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:39.310]  to, to, so to insinuate that I didn't want that process to happen when that's exactly what we
[01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:45.150]  were there to do was to support Congress in the review of the election and to make a decision
[01:52:45.150 --> 01:52:49.150]  about how they're going to go about certifying it or not. Why, why would I want to stop that?
[01:52:49.150 --> 01:52:53.710]  And then it ended up scuttling that and doing the exact opposite of what we desired. It doesn't make
[01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:58.190]  any sense on its face. People know that people see through that. And the truth of the matter is
[01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:02.590]  these headlines today, like the one at Reuters and you know what? Fine. They put the story out
[01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:13.150]  to insinuate that there was ever a coordinated plan by anyone on January 6th for violence is
[01:53:13.150 --> 01:53:18.670]  an outright lie. If we had a coordinated plan, we'd have had weapons. We would have taken over.
[01:53:18.670 --> 01:53:22.670]  You would have been beaten. There have been a hundred different, but then in that civil war,
[01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:26.350]  the Chi comms and others would have invaded, which was a plan. We didn't do that. I mean,
[01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:33.150]  here's the thing. We could already military defeat you. We understand though, they have
[01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:40.910]  enemies. We Alex, we are politically trying to defeat you. You, you godless pieces of crap.
[01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:45.150]  We're there. They're trying to build there. And what it is is they're building the case. They
[01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:49.870]  manufactured the event. They had the national guard stand down. They had the Capitol police
[01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:54.670]  wave us in that. I mean, it's all on record. Pelosi and Mario Bowser didn't want added.
[01:53:54.750 --> 01:54:01.470]  And now they have indicted you for peacefully standing with me. I mean, it's, it's a pissing
[01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:06.030]  in the face. But again, so, so the stories come out today, like, Oh wow. They did not. I don't
[01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:10.590]  want to give a Jesus. You're not Jesus, but we're all trying to be Christ like, but imagine Jesus
[01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:15.710]  has done nothing wrong. And it's on the Jewish holiday and there's Pontius Pilate. And they say,
[01:54:15.710 --> 01:54:19.630]  it's the holiday. We'll let you have someone go free. And the murderer and the rapist and the
[01:54:19.630 --> 01:54:25.470]  killer, they go give us Barabas. Wow. Literally you've done nothing wrong. And the left says,
[01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:32.590]  give us Owen Schroyer, kill him. And I mean, it's literally where these people want innocence.
[01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:39.470]  They want innocence put on trial and destroyed. And the, the, this, this notion that there was ever
[01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:44.750]  any coordination or pre-planning for January six is so ludicrous and they know it. And that should
[01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:49.870]  be the headline is that the it's the feds. It's the Democrats. The pre-planning was by them.
[01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:53.790]  That's what I'm saying. They're the ones that manufactured it with the security stand down.
[01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:59.070]  I mean, we have the Capitol police on video waving people into the building,
[01:54:59.070 --> 01:55:04.750]  removing the barricades. I mean, what, what this, none of this should even be. And now these chicken
[01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:11.470]  shits literally go, let's just indict their number two host. He'll maybe roll over. But imagine Alex
[01:55:12.110 --> 01:55:16.270]  I mean, it's just like, it's like roll over to death. I mean, I mean, what,
[01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:22.270]  what is it you're offering? Well, like Marilyn Monroe, we don't want you. We reject you. They said
[01:55:22.990 --> 01:55:26.590]  when the guy died from the COVID vaccine, they said, well, it was better way to go.
[01:55:26.590 --> 01:55:29.390]  It could have been worse. He gets the vaccine, he dies. Oh, it could have been worse. No,
[01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:32.990]  the woman in San Antonio gave her mother and father the shot. They both died. She said,
[01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:37.470]  well, it was good. There was a better death. I mean, that's the insanity level, but imagine Alex,
[01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:40.990]  and we can go back and find the footage. If we, I'm sure if we wanted to go through hundreds of
[01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:47.710]  hours where we've talked about this before Alex and I are literally outside of the ellipsis
[01:55:47.710 --> 01:55:51.950]  debating what we're going to do. I mean, that's, that's our little coordination.
[01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:55.950]  There was no coordination. It was okay. We're going to be here and then, and then we're going
[01:55:55.950 --> 01:56:00.750]  to be here. And that was it. And so we're sitting there outside of the ellipsis and we're like, hey,
[01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:04.350]  should we go now? Should we go, should we go this way? Should we go that way? Should we wait for
[01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:09.310]  Trump? So it's like literally right before the thing that they're alleging happens,
[01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:13.390]  we still were coordinating. Like we still didn't even know where we were going to do. We still
[01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:18.030]  didn't even know where we were going to walk or what stage, where the stage even was at the
[01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:23.230]  Capitol that we had set up to speak at. I mean, we had a stage that we had paid for at the U S
[01:56:23.230 --> 01:56:28.430]  Capitol on the, on the far side away from, from, uh, from where the ellipsis was. And that's where
[01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:34.110]  we were trying to go was to our stage that we had set up for speakers. I was going to speak,
[01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:37.390]  Alex was going to speak, and there were going to be some other people speaking there. And,
[01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:41.230]  and by the time we got to the Capitol, everything had already unraveled and the ball game had
[01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:46.350]  changed. And, and the new, the new, uh, mission was, Hey, we got to stop this from getting out
[01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:49.390]  of control. We got to get people out of the building. We got to stop people from going in
[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:53.470]  because this is going to scuttle what we want to happen, which is the investigation into the
[01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:59.630]  2020 election. That's what we want. And so that just shows the insane psychology of where we're
[01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:06.110]  at, where obviously we didn't do that. Everybody knows that. And the system knows that. So
[01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:12.270]  the FBI comes out and says, well, Alex Jones and Roger Stone were not part of a conspiracy.
[01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:17.550]  And then another group says, Oh yeah, we're ready to pounce. We're going to indict Owen.
[01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:23.550]  Owen, they've got over 500 people in solitary confinement, many of which did not attack
[01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:27.710]  anybody. They admit that I don't believe they're going to try that, but we're going to back you
[01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:32.190]  110%. And if that means I have to move to DC when you're in that solitary confinement,
[01:57:32.190 --> 01:57:36.830]  I'll be there every day broadcasting from the front lines of that. But I don't think
[01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:40.670]  they're going to try that. I think this is, I think they think we're like cowards like them
[01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:45.070]  are like, Oh God, Owen's in trouble. I better roll over that. They don't get like that. Makes
[01:57:45.070 --> 01:57:49.710]  me 10 times more aggressive. Well, I'll get this. I want you to know, brother, there's not anyone.
[01:57:49.710 --> 01:57:53.710]  I've seen it. I mean, you know, Alex shouldn't even be here doing this broadcast right now,
[01:57:53.710 --> 01:57:56.990]  folks. There's some other stuff going on. You should be handling, but he is here. And let me
[01:57:56.990 --> 01:58:01.310]  just say, this is the most important thing, but let me just say this too. You know, the,
[01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:05.870]  the support that I've gotten with people reaching out since this came out and the people saying
[01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:10.270]  they're praying for me and the people saying that they love me, it really fills my heart.
[01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:15.070]  It fills my soul. And, uh, you know, thank, thank you for the prayers. Thank you for the words of
[01:58:15.070 --> 01:58:19.230]  support. And, uh, you know, that at the end of the day, Alex, that's like what you said. This
[01:58:19.230 --> 01:58:23.950]  is, this is bigger than info Wars. This is bigger than Owen Schroyer. This is a war for humanity.
[01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:27.630]  Just to be honest, Owen, don't you feel more powerful than ever?
[01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:33.550]  I can't, I I'm, I'm almost, I'm almost numb, Alex, to, to just, it's almost like,
[01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:38.190]  it's almost like, uh, you know, when, when you're in the heart of battle and, and you just go into
[01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:42.750]  autonomous mode, you know, you're just, it's just, everything's blowing up around you and
[01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:46.750]  you don't even notice it. Like in the scene from full metal jacket, it's like, you're so
[01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:51.310]  used to the warfare. It's almost like you have tunnel vision. And it's just, all you can see
[01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:56.110]  is the end. All you can see is that this is a war for humanity. This is a war for truth. This is a
[01:58:56.110 --> 01:59:00.670]  war for planet earth. I mean, that's really what this is. This we're in a great world war right
[01:59:00.670 --> 01:59:05.710]  now. And it's tyrants and elitists against this is the great, this is the greatest war in human
[01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:10.750]  history. This is the great war brother. This is all, this is the true end war. This is every,
[01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:15.790]  this is everything. Exactly. That's it. That's what I'm saying. People need to get rid of that.
[01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:19.550]  Hey, the movies are over. The football games are over. I told everybody that works here.
[01:59:20.190 --> 01:59:26.350]  You think I like this? No, this is what it is. It's over. This is the takeover. And then this is
[01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:30.430]  the fight. And as soon as people, cause let me tell you, humanity is going to win. I already
[01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:35.470]  know this, but it's what, how, when do we wake up? When do we realize that there's nothing left to do
[01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:39.550]  but fight? That's the point we're going to get to. And it's like, you know, in a video game or
[01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:44.030]  something where you have, you know, okay, there's, let's say there's a hundred levels of this game.
[01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:50.750]  I mean, we're on level 98, 99, like we're going, like we're going on from level 98 to level 99.
[01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:57.470]  And there's only one level after facing the boss and that's it. And so look, when they can force
[01:59:57.470 --> 02:00:02.190]  you to take an experimental vaccine against your will. And then they, and then they have the videos.
[02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:07.470]  You couldn't even ask for more beating up children, beating up people going to grocery
[02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:13.150]  stores. I mean, dude, exactly. It's the final level. Like it does it, dude, this is it. This
[02:00:13.150 --> 02:00:18.510]  ain't a joke. They released a goddamn bio weapon on us. Think about it. Alex, a nurse takes the
[02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:22.670]  vaccine, goes on TV, passes out on live TV. That should have been enough right there. Wasn't a
[02:00:22.670 --> 02:00:27.070]  health minister takes the vaccine, goes live on TV, passes out on live TV. That wasn't enough.
[02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:33.310]  People sit in the after vaccine room passing out. You have to have an after-vax room because people
[02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:37.390]  just faint and have seizures. We have videos of that. That wasn't enough. The Australian minister
[02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:42.510]  takes it. His face is paralyzed. Not enough. Still not enough there. And then there was a video where
[02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:48.830]  they had a vaccine clinic and, and, and we played it earlier on the, on the war room today. And,
[02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:53.950]  and they had a vaccine clinic and someone has a vaccine, starts seizing up immediately
[02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:59.470]  and someone films it. And all these doctors rush over and they put a cover and a curtain over the
[02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:04.590]  person because you're not allowed to see because they're already normalizing the death. You're not
[02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:09.710]  getting us to adapt to the killing. I mean, imagine that covering it up, covering up the
[02:01:09.710 --> 02:01:14.910]  vaccine side effects. So that's what I'm saying is big tech is covering it up. Doctors are covering
[02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:21.390]  it up. That's all the system knows is the attempt to intimidate you. So I know you got mad at me
[02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:26.750]  earlier. It was the last in part of your show on Friday and we're sitting there and I'm like,
[02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:32.190]  listen, Owen, this is as bad as it is. This is a big deal that came after you. This is a sign of
[02:01:32.190 --> 02:01:36.990]  victory or like, yeah, whatever. I don't care about that. But in a larger spectrum, I had all
[02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:42.030]  these people texting me famous talk show hosts saying, wow, they've really misstepped. Wow. This
[02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:46.910]  is a good thing for Owen. I know you don't want to go to prison. I know you've done nothing wrong.
[02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:52.430]  I know it, but I'm saying you realize this is a real badge of honor to have the enemy do this.
[02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:56.270]  This is, they didn't do this out of weakness. They, they did this out of desperation. They had
[02:01:56.270 --> 02:02:01.950]  to do this. Well, and I think what it is, is that aside from whatever selfish notions I have, I just
[02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:07.310]  realize that like when I see what's happening in Australia or I see what happens to Alex Jones
[02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:12.350]  being censored, all this stuff, I just realized that my fate is the fate of everyone. Alex Jones
[02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:17.790]  fate is the fate of everyone. Australia's fate is the fate of every used. I'm the same way where I
[02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:21.710]  don't care about Hollywood or movies ring famous, but to the people we still matter. So we're not
[02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:26.350]  like a globalist Hollywood star. We're now an example to others. So you're like, I don't care
[02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:30.590]  about being destroyed, being built up. If you understand the fact that they had to do that
[02:02:30.590 --> 02:02:34.750]  is an example that they think you're going to bow to this and you not bowing to this is going
[02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:39.550]  to be a strong weapon against them. This is desperation. Owen, the fact that they indicted
[02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:44.590]  you, they're not ready to get me yet, which don't worry. They will. Don't worry. I'll stand up when
[02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:51.630]  the time comes. But the fact is this is a big deal, man. This is a success. This is, this is like,
[02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:58.910]  I mean, yeah, the enemy of humanity wants to put you in prison for nothing. This is a big deal.
[02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:01.950]  I mean, if you want to talk about, you know, the mountain Rushmore of fighting for America,
[02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:06.430]  I guess this is just another, another star on my resume for it. But like you said, I never
[02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:10.110]  wanted this. I just wanted to tell the truth. I just wanted people to wake up and be healthy and
[02:03:10.110 --> 02:03:15.150]  live. The country's being taken over by satanic communists and they want to destroy you and
[02:03:15.150 --> 02:03:18.990]  silence you and, and scare other people that look what happened. No one Schroeder because
[02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:24.110]  they're satanic. They think if someone's crushed, they're weak. They think Christ is weak because
[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:28.670]  Christ was destroyed. They don't even get it. Oh, that's cause they're satanic. They're blind.
[02:03:29.150 --> 02:03:34.990]  Whereas you're being risen up right now. Alex, they have on TV. Now they cut away on an ABC
[02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:42.990]  news show to a live satanic ritual. They have celebrities on TV doing like promos for live
[02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:49.070]  because they're calling out to their God because they're losing literally though. I mean, like it's,
[02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:54.670]  it's one thing for, for the satanists in the underbelly of society to be running things,
[02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:58.350]  but now they're like, I mean, they're, they're coming out in public.
[02:03:58.350 --> 02:04:01.630]  I mean, they're coming out in public, man. They're doing drag queen story time. They're,
[02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:06.030]  they're, they're, they're telling you, they want to chop your kid's testicles off. They're saying
[02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:11.710]  they're going to take parents from kids and force them to take experimental. This message to you
[02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:17.150]  is a message to this whole crew. They think this crew's made out of cowards.
[02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:23.310]  They think these men and women in here on this special broadcast are scared. They think doing
[02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:28.430]  this, they go, we can't get Jones. He won't back down in his people indict Leanne McAdoo
[02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:36.590]  indict Owen Troyer, Sue them all attacked them. Go after people, go out and see, but do you think
[02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:40.270]  you're going to be safe when she bowed down to these people? No, I don't think they intimidated
[02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:45.390]  this group. I don't think these people, I'm serious. I know who they are because they already
[02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:51.470]  understand you'll lose everything with that attitude. America for all it says, believe in
[02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:58.990]  the individual and Americans aren't cowards and their great moment of attempted intimidation
[02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:04.510]  is going to be our greatest moment. Owen. That's why this is our greatest moment right now,
[02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:08.750]  where we go through the flame together and let them know that we're committed to this fight.
[02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:13.550]  As it all comes out, as the wheels come off the enemy, all these servants of evil are about to
[02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:20.030]  lose everything they've got. I think the biggest thing is going to be asking God for guidance
[02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:26.030]  that he can guide us through this great war, praying for his solace in it as well, because
[02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:33.790]  it's going to be a tormented experience, but in the end, God will win. If we are willing and we
[02:05:33.790 --> 02:05:40.510]  ask God to use us as his tools to defeat this satanic new world order, then we will. These
[02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:46.670]  regimes don't typically last too long. Hopefully we can stop this satanic pedophile cult from
[02:05:46.670 --> 02:05:51.790]  dominating and conquering the planet so that future generations of humans, Americans worldwide,
[02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:57.070]  humans don't have to live under this tyranny. But regardless, we ourselves are going to give
[02:05:57.070 --> 02:06:03.150]  them a good run. We have no option. There's no other option. Exactly. All right. Well,
[02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:09.070]  we already had your co-host indicted set up. He got to get a presidential pardon.
[02:06:09.070 --> 02:06:13.630]  You're the lone survivor on the war room. I guess you're supposed to turn yourself in on Monday.
[02:06:13.630 --> 02:06:18.110]  We'll see what happens with that. I hope you wait till you get on Tucker Carlson before that
[02:06:18.110 --> 02:06:23.550]  happens and before you disappear into the fucking black sea of death. They're coming for me too,
[02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:30.590]  brother. I just think no weapon formed against is going to prosper. Everybody should pray for you
[02:06:30.590 --> 02:06:35.310]  and pray for him for us right now. But you've been here five plus years. I knew you way before that.
[02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:39.150]  We love you, brother. Thank you, Alex. It's all good. All right. It's all going to be good. It's
[02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:44.270]  all in God's plan. I appreciate the crew, and I appreciate Dr. Francis Boyle earlier
[02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:48.670]  for that critical intel. Now it's up to you, the viewers, to decide whether you want to share this
[02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:52.510]  in your email, your text message, Facebook, Twitter, wherever else. It's up to you whether
[02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:56.910]  this dog hunts. It's up to you whether our sacrifice counts. We're counting on you right now.
[02:06:56.910 --> 02:07:00.750]  Share this video, and please give everybody a prayer and prayer for Owen and prayer for
[02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:04.350]  everybody that are political prisoners of this satanic system. Thank you.
[02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:15.790]  By the lies we are told, and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses,
[02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:21.630]  which is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate
[02:07:21.630 --> 02:07:26.990]  crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions,
[02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:32.030]  which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system. The
[02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:37.950]  chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye. Also described as the seat of the soul,
[02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:43.790]  the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen
[02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:50.430]  dimensions of reality. Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:56.110]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[02:07:56.110 --> 02:08:01.710]  free, and the ProPure showerhead will seal the deal. Get them both today for yourself
