[00:34.320 --> 00:39.600]  these are becoming back home on one of the latest police officers killed and we
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.080]  have a Austin attorney who's really at the center of both sides with the
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.320]  situation with the crisis with police brutality but also the crisis of police
[00:48.320 --> 00:52.460]  being executed all over the country he'll be joining us in studio to look
[00:52.460 --> 00:56.840]  at the race war that I can really officially say has been artificially
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.360]  started in this country and it's truly despicable we're gonna get into the
[01:01.360 --> 01:04.600]  latest on Donald Trump the latest on Hillary the latest on the giant immigrant
[01:04.600 --> 01:09.680]  waves slamming into every western country it is an intensifying globalist

[01:22.160 --> 01:28.440]  alex jones here's John bounds report on obama's al-qaeda buddies
[01:28.440 --> 01:34.440]  and yet another document of human history in war there are essentially three
[01:34.440 --> 01:38.920]  ways that historic monuments are destroyed either in a hail of gunfire as
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.600]  it's exchanged by warring soldiers or demolished by bombs dropped from the air
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.160]  or more recently by a Frankenstein monster of religious zealots arrogantly
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.680]  expressing their domination of a captured area and destruction of idols
[01:52.680 --> 01:59.000]  hundreds of casualties in air raids on Syrian market and the media is demonizing
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.480]  the Syrian government saying how dare they it looks like a bunch of civilians
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.880]  got killed because al-qaeda ISIS as they always do base their head base in the
[02:07.880 --> 02:11.600]  city they've taken over this is admitted in the middle of the market because
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.600]  there's buildings within the market Syria has now turned the tide against the
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.400]  rebels two years ago now they've had the tide turned against them the rebels
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.080]  hold more than 60% of the country they're taking major towns and cities every
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.000]  week Russia is basically starting to withdraw support from Syria it looks
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.200]  like it's going to fall to al-qaeda and they are going to murder every christian
[02:37.200 --> 02:41.640]  and jew they get their hands on and then you'll hear our media go gee Syria is so
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.240]  failed they're killing everyone it's so sad just like Libya recently Syrian
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.320]  scholar Khalid al-Assad was beheaded by ISIS militants as a stark message to
[02:52.320 --> 02:57.800]  president Bashir al-Assad as ISIS wages its United Nations and CIA backed
[02:57.800 --> 03:03.240]  horror across the Middle East into the jowls of Damascus the legendary 82-year-old
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.280]  scholar had been interrogated for a month over the location of treasures from
[03:07.280 --> 03:11.600]  palmyra his beheaded and mutilated corpse was hung from one of the Roman era
[03:11.600 --> 03:16.760]  column ruins in the ancient Syrian city with him dissipates decades of world
[03:16.760 --> 03:22.600]  history an irreplaceable relics that stood for thousands of years before the
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.720]  destruction of palmyra the ancient assyrian city of Nimrod the site
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.160]  believed to have been where the Tower of Babel was built was destroyed in March
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.480]  secretary of state John Kerry said he was disturbed by the destruction in
[03:35.480 --> 03:39.480]  Nimrod yet none of this would have happened without Kerry's hidden hand
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.800]  allowing the ISIS monster to grow on his watch mark Alta wheel professor of
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.120]  archaeology at University College of London said I would describe Nimrod as
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.560]  one of the really unique archaeological sites in the entire ancient Near East
[03:53.560 --> 03:58.920]  Nimrod is the capital of the first empire in this long series of empires
[03:58.920 --> 04:03.600]  that have profound significance in the way this region develops and ultimately
[04:03.600 --> 04:10.040]  how it affects our own society in March of 2015 ISIS ravaged Iraq's antiquities
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.920]  destroying the ancient royal city of Sargon and Corzabad northeast of Mosul
[04:14.920 --> 04:19.240]  the ancient city of Hatra and the Mosul Museum where many of the Assyrian
[04:19.240 --> 04:24.080]  artifacts were housed was destroyed the multi-million dollar Mosul library that
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.360]  housed thousands of ancient books and manuscripts were looted and used for
[04:28.360 --> 04:34.200]  firewood and Jonas was blown up Jonas story being one that is spread among all
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.520]  faiths meanwhile the United Nations stands by and rings its hands deeming
[04:39.520 --> 04:44.520]  the destruction of war crime refusing to own up to any of the blame while
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.840]  supporting the New World Order in its bid for global dominance bursting with the
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.160]  demons of the United States and United Nations supported obliteration of human
[04:55.160 --> 05:02.360]  history all right we'll be back a humanitarian crisis of a magnitude not
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.760]  seen since the Second World War is happening right now across the globe
[05:06.760 --> 05:11.480]  Syrian refugees streaming into Europe refused to be put into camps and our
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.000]  boarding trains for Germany where the government has pledged billions of
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.840]  dollars in euros to support them to cover the cost of social benefits
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.640]  language courses and refugee integration into the labor market Germany
[05:23.640 --> 05:28.960]  expects 800,000 refugees this year up from 200,000 last year more than 4
[05:28.960 --> 05:33.840]  million more wait to enter Europe from camps in Turkey Jordan and Lebanon most
[05:33.840 --> 05:37.880]  of the refugees are Sunni Muslims but yet these wealthy Sunni Muslim countries
[05:37.880 --> 05:42.760]  like Qatar United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Bahrain have refused
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.240]  to take in refugees the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Europe the
[05:47.240 --> 05:51.720]  largest since the Second World War is a direct result of the effort by the
[05:51.720 --> 05:55.780]  United States and the Gulf Emirates to overthrow the Syrian government

[08:02.240 --> 08:07.240]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak just let me think
[08:07.240 --> 08:12.560]  even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns supposed to be on their way
[08:12.560 --> 08:18.680]  to transfer something. Damn it! Why? Because while the truncheon may be used at lieu of conversation
[08:18.680 --> 08:24.360]  words will always retain their power words are for the means to meaning and
[08:24.360 --> 08:30.400]  for those who will listen the enunciation of truth. There is something
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.600]  terribly wrong with this country isn't there? You designed it sir you wanted it
[08:34.600 --> 08:41.000]  foolproof you told me every television in longer. Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression and where once
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.280]  you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit you now have
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.040]  sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.960]  cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more
[08:55.960 --> 09:01.160]  responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told if
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.320]  you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror. I know why you
[09:07.320 --> 09:14.000]  did it I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror and disease there were a
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.680]  myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[09:18.680 --> 09:23.520]  common sense. Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now
[09:23.520 --> 09:29.360]  high Chancellor Adam Sutler. He promised you order he promised you peace and all
[09:29.360 --> 09:43.200]  he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent. There is a war happening now. It will
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.740]  decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come. We are the
[09:48.740 --> 09:57.320]  resistance. We are the Info War. Thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen on
[09:57.320 --> 10:05.880]  this Thursday the third day of September 2015. We'll be live tomorrow with the
[10:05.880 --> 10:11.600]  Friday transmission. We'll be live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. as well and I'm going to
[10:11.600 --> 10:17.000]  tape and also put together a best of show that'll be a mix of new reports and
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.120]  also some of our best ofs coming up on Monday over the holiday long weekend and
[10:23.120 --> 10:30.000]  of course there's Info Wars Nightly News 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time that
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.400]  you'll be able to tune into Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 the Nightly News of
[10:35.400 --> 10:45.600]  course 7 o'clock weeknights. I am just so incredibly frustrated and outraged by
[10:45.600 --> 10:53.320]  the clear naked open promotion of racial division and race war in this country
[10:53.320 --> 10:59.480]  and the shocking rhetoric of Lewis Farrakhan and other organizations that
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.600]  if any other organization or group was saying it you would have investigations
[11:04.600 --> 11:09.800]  you would have indictments but because we have a Justice Department and a
[11:09.800 --> 11:18.080]  White House and then George Soros above that quarterbacking the operation it is
[11:18.080 --> 11:25.880]  seen as acceptable by the minions in the government who then won't respond or
[11:25.880 --> 11:30.960]  do anything about the promotion of what is clearly terrorism in this country
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.080]  going out and shooting and killing and executing people and regardless of what
[11:36.080 --> 11:40.080]  you think about some of the police out there they have a right to a judge they
[11:40.080 --> 11:43.760]  have a right to a jury they have a right to do process and I know the argument
[11:43.760 --> 11:47.600]  is some of these judges and juries and grand juries are corrupt and cops get
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.400]  away with a lot and in some jurisdictions that's certainly true in
[11:51.400 --> 11:56.600]  some jurisdictions the good cops get targeted all I know is there is an
[11:56.600 --> 12:04.200]  organized planned program to start a civil war in this country ignited by race
[12:04.200 --> 12:09.560]  war right at the time that the global of social engineers are causing conflicts
[12:09.560 --> 12:16.560]  all over the planet and they'll take any division they can exacerbate it to create
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.320]  divide and conquer they'll come in and hype Crip versus blood to get blacks
[12:21.320 --> 12:31.920]  killing each other and now look where that is today so it's a very serious
[12:31.920 --> 12:42.440]  situation and I know that the audience of this broadcast is fully aware of that
[12:42.440 --> 12:49.640]  I know that the audience of this radio show TV show understands that but we
[12:49.640 --> 12:57.320]  have to get that information out to everyone else in the country and the
[12:57.320 --> 13:02.400]  world and we have tens of millions of regular listeners we've probably got
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.760]  upwards of 10 million hardcore listeners and fans of liberty that tune in
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.880]  each and every week we've got four or five million people we have all the
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.960]  metrics that tune in every day we have over 10 million people that kind of
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.280]  passively come through the show and the different platforms of the broadcast
[13:22.280 --> 13:26.840]  every week and those are the real people we're trying to shake out of their
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.640]  doldrums shake out of their trance to realize the big picture and understand
[13:31.640 --> 13:36.400]  the epic historical developments that are taking place right now when they're
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.960]  bold enough to start renaming mountains and the president is operating as a
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.880]  dictator shutting down power plants opening borders funding ISIS when they're
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.960]  bold enough to be selling body parts of babies and whole babies when they're
[13:52.960 --> 13:56.320]  bold enough to be put in fluoride in the water known to lower IQ and cause
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.640]  brain damage and bone cancer when they're bold enough we have new footage
[14:00.640 --> 14:06.360]  out of Mexico of girls convulsing and collapsing and writhing after they're
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.160]  given the Gardasil shot that video is up on info wars.com and this is the
[14:12.160 --> 14:15.880]  response that's happened in other parts of the world they push it is trendy
[14:15.880 --> 14:20.720]  cool wonderful from Australia to the United States and a good minority of
[14:20.720 --> 14:29.280]  the girls that take it have convulsions within an hour of taking it a smaller
[14:29.280 --> 14:34.940]  minority die. Others have autoimmune disorders others get
[14:34.940 --> 14:40.760]  guion beret narcolepsy it is admittedly a super dangerous vaccine that has been
[14:40.760 --> 14:48.440]  banned in many countries and they're forcing every girl in Mexico every
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.560]  school-age girl to take it they do it at the school and they give it to them in
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.760]  the morning and by lunchtime their infirmary is full of girls writhing
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.880]  around having convulsions blood coming out of their noses and they can just do
[15:02.880 --> 15:08.840]  this and just push it as establishment and get away with it just like yesterday
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.640]  in the fourth hour we reared a David Knight interview from the nightly news a
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.480]  few months ago with a whistleblower nurse she sent us her ID she sent us all
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.600]  her proof from the major hospital that she's a senior nurse at of course we
[15:20.600 --> 15:24.200]  didn't show all that on air another whistleblower report the woman did use
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.240]  her name and they said we run the premium departments they could be six
[15:28.240 --> 15:32.200]  months seven months they could even be doing well for a week we get the order
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.240]  inoculate them all and we get ready to get respirators defibrillators we get
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.440]  ready to fight for their lives we hold their hands we give them the vaccines
[15:41.440 --> 15:46.720]  and the poor little things start convulsing and they start losing them
[15:46.720 --> 15:54.560]  this is the modern firing squads and it's done hidden in plain view and they
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.440]  don't care if you're an FBI agent's baby girl they don't care if you're an
[15:58.440 --> 16:02.480]  auto mechanics baby boy they don't care if you're Hispanic they don't care of
[16:02.480 --> 16:05.800]  your black they don't care of your white they don't care if you're an immigrant
[16:05.800 --> 16:10.760]  from Russia or Mexico the new world order wants to inject you and just
[16:10.760 --> 16:15.320]  normalize all the death all the mental illness all the brain damage all the
[16:15.320 --> 16:19.920]  neurological disorders all the autism all the autoimmune disorders and just
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.840]  normalize that suddenly there's all these sick people everywhere and we had
[16:23.840 --> 16:29.960]  one in 25,000 with autism 30 years ago and now it's one in 58 CDC's own numbers
[16:29.960 --> 16:42.200]  they estimate 1 in 10 then 1 in 3 1 in 10 by 2025 1 in 3 by 2030 just type it in
[16:42.200 --> 16:46.440]  you can pull it up yourself and it'll be normal just to don't be against
[16:46.440 --> 16:49.640]  everybody that's in wheelchairs and can't talk why you being hateful of the
[16:49.640 --> 16:54.240]  cripple people don't use the word crippled be politically correct use the
[16:54.240 --> 16:59.520]  term handicap see it's all about don't use the word crippled but don't care
[16:59.520 --> 17:07.920]  why everybody is crippled see how they play these games oh we don't sell the
[17:07.920 --> 17:13.800]  embryonic tissue of babies in the first three weeks we just saw the fetal tissue
[17:13.800 --> 17:21.600]  up to nine months it's all semantical games all little jokes all little scams
[17:21.600 --> 17:27.480]  all so funny gaming all the unconscious TV heads they're like little
[17:27.480 --> 17:30.760]  children I walk around to see the general public my little kids their eyes
[17:30.760 --> 17:38.160]  was kind of open like oh in a trance day oh just just putting on fronts of how

[18:14.600 --> 18:19.080]  I've looked at it closely it's it's very alien and I have no proof of aliens I
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.040]  don't get into UFOs but the more I research this and look at it this is
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.080]  not of this world man I'm a Christian it's the devil I just that's what that's
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.200]  all I can handle it's the devil every culture said there's this evil force
[18:32.200 --> 18:36.160]  that gets people to do bad things and that there's a master design behind it
[18:36.160 --> 18:39.680]  that's beyond humans and I'm telling you I've looked at this and it's so
[18:39.680 --> 18:46.640]  sophisticated and the formulae is so sickening that I want to believe it's
[18:46.640 --> 18:51.400]  it's an entity a spirit and not my fellow humans but the truth is you get

[18:59.720 --> 19:04.440]  that'll sell their mama out for a stick of bubblegum and then there are very
[19:04.440 --> 19:09.480]  small groups of people that have super high IQs and are almost like ass burgers

[30:04.800 --> 30:09.360]  a close associate the GOP candidate intends to sign the loyalty pledge that
[30:09.360 --> 30:13.080]  would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would preclude him a
[30:13.080 --> 30:16.960]  third-party run the Republican National Committee has made it clear that they
[30:16.960 --> 30:21.120]  want every candidate running for nomination to sign a pledge not to
[30:21.120 --> 30:25.560]  break off and run as a third-party candidate under any circumstances the
[30:25.560 --> 30:29.360]  GOP is worried that third-party campaigns will jeopardize the party's
[30:29.360 --> 30:33.660]  chances against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate and as he's
[30:33.660 --> 30:37.800]  currently the most popular candidate the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may
[30:37.800 --> 30:41.560]  break off from the pact and he has repeatedly threatened to do so
[30:41.560 --> 30:45.400]  Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul reminded everyone that it was
[30:45.400 --> 30:49.560]  Ross Perot who ended up giving us the first Clinton and if Trump breaks off

[34:50.840 --> 34:55.280]  going door to door again throughout the neighborhoods right across from where the
[34:55.280 --> 34:59.960]  police officer was shot and killed now earlier yesterday morning the police came
[34:59.960 --> 35:03.920]  out and said that they had suspended the search in this area but then they started
[35:03.920 --> 35:07.880]  following up on leads that they were getting through social media which brought
[35:07.880 --> 35:11.760]  them back to the neighborhood across to there and I had the opportunity to go
[35:11.760 --> 35:15.960]  through take some pictures and video of these guys going door to door now these
[35:15.960 --> 35:19.440]  guys weren't dressed up in regular cop gear these guys had on you know bullet
[35:19.440 --> 35:25.320]  proof vest ooze ease assault rifles shotguns everything you could think of
[35:25.320 --> 35:29.720]  and they said hey we're going door to door we're looking for a suspected cop
[35:29.720 --> 35:34.080]  killer we have to treat each home like there could be a violent person in there
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.840]  so these guys are going around doing that and during that time there was a
[35:38.840 --> 35:42.320]  vigil that was going on as well for the police officer which had a lot of folks
[35:42.320 --> 35:45.480]  distracted a lot of people were gone there was about a thousand people who
[35:45.480 --> 35:52.120]  showed up for Lieutenant Glenevich is a vigil that was going on so I had the
[35:52.120 --> 35:54.680]  opportunity to walk up and down the street without a lot of traffic and
[35:54.680 --> 35:59.600]  watch these guys as they went from house to house following leads and you know
[35:59.600 --> 36:03.600]  whatever you have you with that during that time a lady came out from her house
[36:03.600 --> 36:07.520]  with a cell phone and said that a friend of hers called her that works at the
[36:07.520 --> 36:09.440]  dollar
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.120]  Joe your skype's breaking up wait a minute till it gets better and then go
[36:17.120 --> 36:20.480]  back about 10 seconds a lady came out of her house with a cell phone please
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.880]  continue yes the lady came out of her house with a cell phone and a friend of
[36:25.880 --> 36:28.840]  hers had called who worked at the dollar general which is not too far off the
[36:28.840 --> 36:33.080]  road from where we were at about a five minute drive and the lady said that two
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.000]  girls had walked into the store and were bragging about who had killed the
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.320]  cops they knew who it was so she handed the phone over to the US Marshals the
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.840]  marshals talked to that lady the dollar general and they had a further walk they
[36:46.840 --> 36:49.960]  took their time they had a good you know quarter of a mile walk to get back to
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.880]  their vehicle my vehicle was only a hundred yards away so I talked to the
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.080]  lady I said hey what information did you just tell the marshals she says yeah my
[36:58.080 --> 37:01.600]  friend's working up here at the store some girls came in bragging that they
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.600]  knew who you know killed the cops so I jumped in my vehicle and beat feet over
[37:05.600 --> 37:08.800]  there and got there before the police said and when I walked up the lady goes
[37:08.800 --> 37:13.680]  she just seemed freaked out I said hey did you just call someone and say that
[37:13.680 --> 37:19.440]  you saw someone talking about who killed the cop and she flipped out she says I
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.800]  can't talk to you the US Marshals tell me not to talk to anybody so at that
[37:22.800 --> 37:26.080]  point in time that's when things started to heat up because the marshals pulled
[37:26.080 --> 37:29.200]  up they started talking and then that's when he started seeing more police
[37:29.200 --> 37:33.440]  presence coming out then a few hours later you get this bogus call coming in
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.560]  it's about 9 20 p.m. last night this lady calls in says that she was driving
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.840]  down the road her car broke down and she was on the side of the road two guys
[37:42.840 --> 37:48.560]  approached her asking if they could get a ride until Milwaukee and she said by
[37:48.560 --> 37:52.360]  her story is that they ran because they were scared that she was gonna call the
[37:52.360 --> 37:55.360]  cops on them and she gave the description of what the police were
[37:55.360 --> 37:58.640]  looking for we know that there's two white male suspects on the loose and a
[37:58.640 --> 38:01.880]  black male she said there was a white male and a black male that tried to
[38:01.880 --> 38:07.920]  see essentially rock and take her car so this began an all-night manhood I
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.240]  stayed there for 24 hours straight yesterday haven't eaten and quite
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.000]  honestly I'm pissed I hope they filled this woman under the jail because if the
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.200]  suspects weren't out of town and they were in Fox Lake yesterday guess what
[38:20.200 --> 38:23.320]  they're sure as hell gonna be gone now because all they had to do was turn on
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.200]  the TV and see all the helicopters flying overhead the airplanes hundreds you
[38:28.200 --> 38:32.040]  know not if not even maybe one or two thousand police officers running around
[38:32.040 --> 38:35.280]  up and down the streets through cornfields which I was involved in I'm
[38:35.280 --> 38:38.820]  going through cornfields looking around I'm not scared to go out there so we're
[38:38.820 --> 38:42.720]  out there running around looking for this because we thought this was a
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.240]  credible threat and the next thing you know you start getting people are calling
[38:47.240 --> 38:50.280]  and saying hey there's suspicious people walking through our yards this and
[38:50.280 --> 38:53.000]  that so next thing you know there was this wild goose chase going on all
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.680]  night and till about two three o'clock in the morning and it was all because a
[38:57.680 --> 39:01.200]  lady lied because she wanted attention she was a nanny and she was looking for
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.920]  attention from a family that she was working for and essentially threw the
[39:06.920 --> 39:10.280]  entire thing away now because of a lot well she's gonna get attention now I
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.440]  mean I've never seen one of these cross-burnings in modern times where it
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.520]  wasn't people doing it for attention I mean there's been some real Nazi
[39:18.520 --> 39:22.640]  murders and clan murders but but not really cross-burnings in yards every
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.200]  Jewish center we've seen without exception with the swastikas put on it
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.840]  has been fake every time a dorm gets a swastika put on it it's been fake I
[39:31.840 --> 39:36.080]  mean it's almost always I think there's been a few real ones total it's almost
[39:36.080 --> 39:40.780]  always a false flag and same way women that's claimed three black guys rape
[39:40.780 --> 39:45.680]  them and you know carve stuff on their face turns out that's a lie or a black
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.120]  lady claims white people raped them that's a lie there is a penchant in
[39:50.120 --> 39:54.560]  criminology just like men commit most murders women commit most of the making
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.200]  stuff up to get attention it's just bizarre they'll claim they're raped all
[39:58.200 --> 40:02.000]  the time and that's why so many time the police don't believe a woman when
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.520]  she's claims that they've been raped if there isn't hardcore evidence because so
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.720]  many women lie and say they've been raped I mean I just don't get the
[40:08.720 --> 40:12.960]  psychology of claiming that you know you get carjacked or you get attacked if you
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.360]  didn't job at the end of the day this is just so sad especially for this
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.980]  community there was a thousand people who showed up to this police officer's
[40:21.980 --> 40:25.480]  vigil that's a lot of people I hope that many people show up if I die to
[40:25.480 --> 40:29.400]  something you know that's amazing to show you that the community really liked
[40:29.400 --> 40:32.640]  this person you know we hear about a lot of bad police officers but this was a
[40:32.640 --> 40:35.600]  good police officer I mean there were people that have known to have been
[40:35.600 --> 40:39.480]  scumbags in this town who showed up people respected this guy and showed up
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.400]  for him and this lady threw it all away she disrespected the community she
[40:43.400 --> 40:46.840]  screwed up the entire manhunt because like I said all these guys would have
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.240]  had to have done last night was turn on the TV and see that these guys were
[40:50.240 --> 40:53.720]  south and they could have just walked out of here free because there was no cops
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.240]  up here they were all down here and all the news was up here at the police
[40:57.240 --> 41:00.680]  station about 15 minutes away or 10 minutes away from where everything was
[41:00.680 --> 41:04.640]  going on lying woman blows manhunt Joe Biggs I'm gonna go to call his great
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.640]  job are you planning to come home today or tomorrow yeah today all right well
[41:09.640 --> 41:12.440]  anything else you want to add about what you've seen what you've taken away from
[41:12.440 --> 41:17.760]  this well I do find it's very interesting the fact that the police said
[41:17.760 --> 41:21.600]  that they were gonna come at this arm door-to-door and treat every home they
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.880]  go to like there is you know some armed suspect especially when we have rights I
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.400]  mean you're innocent until proven guilty so I think that's a little messed up that
[41:29.400 --> 41:32.920]  that's the message that they put out that they're gonna go around armed like
[41:32.920 --> 41:38.040]  every home they go to is a potentially a violent situation well these guys are
[41:38.040 --> 41:41.000]  hiding there that's certainly the case but there's always bad guys hiding
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.400]  somewhere so absolutely it's an escalation of the threat continuum and
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.400]  basically turning everyone into suspects in a police state which is going to so
[41:50.400 --> 41:54.920]  distrust and only cause the war between the people and the police to
[41:54.920 --> 42:00.560]  accelerate Joe Biggs great job we'll see you back here tomorrow in studio to
[42:00.560 --> 42:03.920]  break things down thank you thank you for having me on Alex you bet thank you
[42:03.920 --> 42:06.720]  great job going up there now we're gonna go to your phone calls and then
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.120]  coming up speaking of that there is a dead police officer memorial just about a
[42:11.120 --> 42:16.000]  mile away from where the deputy was executed last Friday in the county where
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.560]  Houston's based Harris County and folks have been egging that and there's been
[42:22.560 --> 42:27.840]  more calls on radio and TV to kill police I mean this is insane asylum level
[42:27.840 --> 42:35.280]  and it's only being allowed by the White House to start a civil war and I
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.160]  know I keep repeating that but I've been saying it the last few years every day
[42:39.160 --> 42:42.960]  now it's clear it's happening we're trying to stop it this thing has
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.560]  basically been on slow burn now the fuse is burning very very fast and for all
[42:47.560 --> 42:52.080]  intents and purposes this stuff is already begun if it goes one level higher
[42:52.080 --> 42:58.520]  of escalation it's gonna chain reaction we are right on the verge of hundreds of
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.480]  police getting killed and then the police are just gonna go completely
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.160]  crazy they're gonna stop responding to regular crime as they've done in
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.080]  Baltimore and other areas and then crime is just gonna explode especially in the
[43:12.080 --> 43:16.520]  areas where people are disarmed but even in areas where we have guns crime is
[43:16.520 --> 43:22.360]  gonna go up right as the economy falls apart and you can just see the riding on
[43:22.360 --> 43:27.560]  the wall this is a sickening situation I'm going to your phone calls now I knew
[43:27.560 --> 43:32.400]  it'd be a hit we came out with our own Hillary Clinton for present t-shirts and
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.400]  we've already sold about a third of those we've got more on order but if you do
[43:36.400 --> 43:39.320]  want to support the broadcast and also wake people up the fact that Hillary
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.240]  Clinton is a criminal it's a collector's item we're only gonna make these in the
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.240]  last few months of this year we've had a lot of special edition t-shirts this is
[43:47.240 --> 43:54.800]  one of them Hillary for present 2016 on the back it says info wars com legalized
[43:54.800 --> 44:02.920]  freedom using Iran Paul quote so people can say what do you mean Hillary for
[44:02.920 --> 44:06.560]  present well here's the thing she's done and you know if we punish her we can
[44:06.560 --> 44:09.200]  start punishing other politicians we need to bring the fear of God into these
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.640]  people legally and lawfully and well well who are you with what do you stand
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.240]  for well info wars com well what's it well it wants to legalize freedom it's
[44:19.240 --> 44:24.160]  a movement of people that are sick of corruption want common sense and judge
[44:24.160 --> 44:28.000]  individuals on the character of their deeds what they stand for not what
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.560]  color they are not not what group they're part of but what they stand for
[44:31.560 --> 44:37.760]  what how they live what they do so the Hillary for present 2016 Rob do had a
[44:37.760 --> 44:40.400]  great idea when he was hosting in the fourth hour yesterday we brought that
[44:40.400 --> 44:44.320]  hour back but now kind of a wrap-up roundtable show fire it will we're
[44:44.320 --> 44:47.200]  thinking of the name of it should be just the wrap-up show should it be
[44:47.200 --> 44:51.800]  overdrive fire it will or should there be sections in overdrive like fire it
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.960]  will we're each reporter in here covers 10 stories and you know two minutes or
[44:55.960 --> 44:59.160]  something I don't know but we're really gonna heavily program that fourth hour

[45:06.280 --> 45:09.360]  formulating it right now but it's gonna be probably one of the hottest hours of
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.080]  the four hours every single day here and it's up on the satellite for all of our
[45:14.080 --> 45:17.320]  radio affiliates to pick it up if they would like to the fourth hour will now

[49:49.640 --> 49:53.880]  truth to yeah I found it you can document right in here okay go ahead yeah
[49:53.880 --> 49:57.720]  FEMA capstone 2014 national exercise begins yes we covered this at info wars
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.560]  calm and then they've got the army training manuals to put us in FEMA
[50:01.560 --> 50:07.960]  camps no I know sir it's all public yeah yeah and I just wanted to point out you
[50:07.960 --> 50:11.400]  know for the people that have any doubt as to what is coming the military puts a
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.200]  name on the face of the enemy they're going to fight under section 6.1 quote
[50:16.200 --> 50:20.600]  this is the scenario story setting the US Northern Command mission of defense
[50:20.600 --> 50:24.400]  support to civil authorities has led to increased activity by some anti-government
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.160]  organization currently the most vocal organization is free American against
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.360]  socialist tyranny using social media they advertise anti-us rhetoric focusing
[50:34.360 --> 50:38.320]  on the Department of Defense as well as to recruit like-minded individuals to
[50:38.320 --> 50:42.480]  join their cause and they go on to say that their number one focus is
[50:42.480 --> 50:48.080]  sympathizers within the government and military to the cause of free Americans
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.080]  against socialist tyranny I mean this is this is bold right here yes I remember
[50:52.080 --> 50:55.680]  whenever this came out in full wars wrote a story about it homeland security
[50:55.680 --> 50:59.840]  exercise targets free Americans against socialist tyranny Paul Joseph Watson
[50:59.840 --> 51:05.640]  wrote about that in March of 2014 sir I'm glad you're freaking out about this
[51:05.640 --> 51:10.320]  I'm glad you're upset I'm glad you're concerned do you understand we have the
[51:10.320 --> 51:16.080]  emergency centers establishment act we have the civilian inmate labor camp
[51:16.080 --> 51:21.440]  program we have the interment resettlement army document we have the
[51:21.440 --> 51:25.840]  military telling us they're training for this and so they're gearing up to go
[51:25.840 --> 51:30.600]  after gun owners and veterans and local police officers you name it while
[51:30.600 --> 51:34.880]  funding a race war they're clearly gearing up for something big and I just
[51:34.880 --> 51:39.040]  wonder how do all these crooks and the Obama administration and people above
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.640]  them think they're gonna get away with this but they've certainly got some
[51:43.640 --> 51:50.480]  plan and the answer is false flags to be blamed and that's why they kind of
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.320]  gave like a catch all fictional name so that Homeland Security people reading
[51:55.320 --> 52:00.120]  that document would try to search that and wouldn't find any real groups bearing
[52:00.120 --> 52:05.320]  that or would then find doppelgangers run by the Feds that put out hateful
[52:05.320 --> 52:09.000]  rhetoric understand that's not really a real group from my research last year
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.440]  back at the time it's just a catch all so the people reading it for themselves
[52:13.440 --> 52:17.480]  can't go out and find out if it's true or not it's just to owe people against
[52:17.480 --> 52:23.560]  socialists and yes they are preparing this and that's why you add the move
[52:23.560 --> 52:27.880]  with the White House protected groups saying kill police how are they gonna
[52:27.880 --> 52:32.680]  then say kill the police but then still blame the Patriots well how are they
[52:32.680 --> 52:36.200]  gonna create al-Qaeda and ISIS turn them loose all over the Middle East to kill
[52:36.200 --> 52:42.880]  everybody and then turn around and say we've got a bomb Assad to stop ISIS when
[52:42.880 --> 52:48.000]  Assad is fighting ISIS see that's how crazy this is is the public is so
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.600]  illiterate when it comes to politics and in terms that's what George Arwell
[52:53.600 --> 52:58.080]  said you destroy language you destroy people's minds it's like trying to talk
[52:58.080 --> 53:03.120]  to and I'm not being mean but it's like trying to explain algebra to somebody
[53:03.120 --> 53:07.600]  that's got down syndrome I mean I have trouble doing algebra I don't have a
[53:07.600 --> 53:12.440]  very mathematical brain but I can figure it out I can pass the class I can do
[53:12.440 --> 53:17.560]  some trigonometry but you try to teach it to somebody with a 70 IQ it ain't
[53:17.560 --> 53:22.440]  happening well they've artificially with chemicals and TV and the culture done
[53:22.440 --> 53:26.920]  this to people now where they might say that you know groups killing hundreds of
[53:26.920 --> 53:32.280]  cops even though it you know it's it's black lives matter connected groups they
[53:32.280 --> 53:37.040]  might come out and say the Patriots did it I mean they say I'm behind the Boston
[53:37.040 --> 53:43.440]  bombing they say I want cops dead with no proof I said at the time they'll end up
[53:43.440 --> 53:50.200]  within a year blaming Assad for al Qaeda and ISIS and they did exactly that so so
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.240]  I actually believe once they start a wave of cops being killed they're going
[53:55.240 --> 54:00.200]  to have some Patriot group they run be set up for killing a bunch of cops at
[54:00.200 --> 54:05.040]  some you know police event or something a bomb who knows and then they're gonna
[54:05.040 --> 54:09.880]  say we're done with cops being killed we're arresting the Patriots and the
[54:09.880 --> 54:15.320]  average person will just say okay do it I mean it's so warped it's so sick it's
[54:15.320 --> 54:20.120]  so upside down it's so illogical I don't even know what to say at this point
[54:20.120 --> 54:26.280]  brother but it's definitely happening anything else um yeah I would like to
[54:26.280 --> 54:31.720]  add my friend is in the Detroit State Police I played hockey with him I can
[54:31.720 --> 54:36.120]  give you his name off air he specifically my friends were asking him at
[54:36.120 --> 54:40.080]  the bar this was in October of 2013 they're asking him hey are you still
[54:40.080 --> 54:43.080]  being trained to go after the Libertarians and the Royal Paul supporters
[54:43.080 --> 54:47.200]  and he Joe and he kind of like laughed it off and then he straight up told us
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.600]  that they're being prepared by the DHS for all out civil war in 2017 I just
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.080]  and I mean I vetted that for quite a while and now it just it really seems
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.600]  to be coming to fruition I just thought that was interesting I know it is coming
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.840]  to fruition I don't wish any black people harm any cops harm I don't wish
[55:06.840 --> 55:10.920]  any Hispanics harm I don't miss any Asians harm I just want to have free
[55:10.920 --> 55:14.480]  market and have a country and let us have power plants and let us grow food
[55:14.480 --> 55:18.160]  and let us eat good food that didn't GMO and don't shoot kids up with deadly
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.240]  vaccines and let us be healthy and not have a surveilled all the time and you
[55:23.240 --> 55:26.320]  know just have a basic decent prosperous country but that isn't what the
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.840]  globalists want they want to capture and break the back of this country and
[55:29.840 --> 55:34.520]  this is modern globalist warfare right now and I really appreciate you Taylor
[55:34.520 --> 55:39.160]  for calling in you know short of breath a FEMA document says it wants to go
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.080]  after the Patriots and round us up with the military it's a it's a FEMA dot
[55:43.080 --> 55:48.400]  gov and I can't believe you're not we didn't talk about it but I should be

[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.560]  three points and they're extremely corrupt out here by the border and I
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:45.280]  take care of my disabled mother on dirt roads and that it's run by you know
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:53.160]  liberals out here and we like have no roads to drive on and no trash services
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.720]  and I have to take care of my disabled mother while the borders are down and
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.640]  I'm like the only defense out here and the police ignore all of the complaints
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.760]  out here complain so many times about them it's unbelievable and I'm targeted
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.440]  by them and another driver claimed to have seen my gun and they're trying to
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:18.640]  give me six years in prison and I have no criminal record whatsoever and oh yeah
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:22.920]  they're using all sorts of laws BLM laws you name it to just go after everybody

[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.280]  now and the cops need to realize that they can't go along with this anymore

[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.000]  transparency the huge political advantage and basically you know call
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.840]  the stupidity American voter or whatever you understand you're living in a
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.280]  science fiction I'm living in the government has just approved the use of
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.720]  a computer chip that would be implanted under your skin when complete
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.120]  everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity number at DNA is stored even
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.840]  without your consent but I mean today point blank say we're putting a chip in
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:15.760]  I guess it was an interior barcode if you will this makes my head explode that
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.280]  your television could be e-dropping on your conversations and then sharing it
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.480]  over the web all the cars now have tracker boxes that can remote control
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.160]  your vehicle in them the Justice Department is building a national
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.280]  database to track in real time the movement of vehicles around the US
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.560]  storing hundreds of millions of records about motorists it's like see a leader
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.000]  space aliens or something with a master plan it's so evil it's so sadistic
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  no it's the devil I mean that's it this galactic force of destruction that's
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:54.680]  animating people to do this the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.240]  Alex Jones show ladies and gentlemen as promised we're taking a lot of phone
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:07.040]  calls today and then we're gonna have a lawyer in studio who I met downtown
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.320]  years ago and learned he was a listener and then we ended up having him on as a
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:16.200]  guest before and he manually sues police departments in questionable police
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.680]  actions so I think it's important to get a perspective from someone that's
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.280]  upset with the police and the way they're behaving who isn't calling like
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.520]  Lewis Farrakhan for going after him and he's a pretty smart guy and you know
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.040]  basically looks at both sides of it but I think it's important to really
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.440]  investigate this so he's gonna go over some cases with us in studio in the
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.240]  next hour right now we've got open phones there is a lot of important news
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:50.120]  obviously up on info wars calm Donald Trump is saying he will sign the GOP
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.720]  pledge promising not to run as a third party that means he's even more of a
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.240]  serious candidate because if he runs he'll mainly pull conservatives away and
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.760]  put a Democrat in so that's a really good sign now if somebody more liberal
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.040]  ran third party and pull away from the Democrats but Democrats work like such a
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.680]  herd that that isn't the case you know it was some of the other perennial
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.880]  candidates like Ralph Nader and others they just only pull a few percentage
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.760]  points so it doesn't it doesn't do anything there's an amazing video up on
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.480]  info wars calm where John Bown ask are they using neutron bombs in Yemen I
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.000]  mean their explosions just so big it's no way it's conventional bombs he's not
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.200]  saying it's it it is he's questioning because we know these weapons exist these
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.280]  are weapons that basically send out a huge radiation wave but then don't
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.840]  damage too much actual material but they don't even look like neutron bombs to
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.280]  me it looks like a comic bomb or something it just really wild video of
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:54.880]  what's going on over there that's up on info wars calm right now ladies and
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.080]  gentlemen let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls Otter in Massachusetts
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.400]  you're on the air go ahead well greetings terms of liberty 2.0
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:11.680]  constitutionalist how you been man I'm doing alright brother I'm I'm just can
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.200]  feel the quickening I can I can just see it intellectually but also feel the
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.640]  fact that we're all in great great peril can you feel it and feel it it is just
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:29.680]  thick as mud I don't know what to call it anymore ditto ditto and ditto
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.440]  synchronicity I can't really get into talking about anything because you're
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.240]  covering it all you're on it you're just you're hitting every thought I have
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:45.040]  bam bam bam so I'm gonna say that in June I did the detox the gallbladder and
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.880]  liver and it was extended due to different things that were happening in
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.720]  life and it went on for two and a half weeks that I was prepping for it and my
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.000]  goodness I'm knocking on 67 and the things that came out of me and I have
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.760]  lived a relatively clean life non smoking non meat eating red meat since I
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.360]  was like 13 I'd begun to do supplementation because I knew that the
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:19.240]  nutrients and food were going down having come up on the farm exposure to
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:25.720]  DDT exposure to Agent Orange exposure to the geoengineering and everything
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:31.680]  including what Dr. Group was talking about yesterday clearly has the air the
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:38.000]  water the soil the foods had taken a toll on me and I do feel considerably
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.880]  younger and I'm actually seeing hair follicles come in that weren't a lot of
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:48.480]  marked places I particularly need them my arms and chest but as well my hair is
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.640]  sticking on my head the products that you're selling are fanatical and in
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:00.600]  your efforts and they are proven through their use so I wanted to thank you all
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.280]  for all that effort and I guess I'm gonna let you go on to the next person I
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.800]  would go on to labels and I would go on to Bilderberg Jr. that just went down
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:15.040]  here where I am go ahead go ahead well Bill was walking around all over the
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.840]  place you know I saw Bill six blocks away from where I sit right this moment
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:25.680]  probably yep yep I would say that he probably from what you could tell had
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.800]  more one-in-one FaceTime physically but this place just became you could not go
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:41.840]  anywhere that it wasn't propagandist media authors politicians musicians you
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.520]  name it all groveling it was just gravel central and it was it was mind
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.000]  boggling I mean in one sense I ran into a fellow I was talking in a grocery
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.160]  store and a number of people were around me and you could tell some of them
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.360]  were listening and were proving and some weren't and some were entering into the
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.120]  dialogue and then this little skinny chicken neck guy who was probably 20
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:09.520]  years older than he looked comes in and says you think Obamacare screwing you
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:19.920]  now wait until you see what happens in the future I know I mean they are
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.080]  really planning to drop the hammer on this country they brag about it they're
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.800]  very arrogant about it and it's just just amazing the good news is people are
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.960]  waking up but that's the bad news is making them move quicker they're not
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.080]  going to give up so it's like two freight trains coming at each other down the
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:43.200]  same track thank you Otter wild in Wisconsin you're on the air go ahead
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:49.680]  and mr. Jones before I get to my first point I'm curious know how it feels for
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.800]  you when you hit that pedal to the metal in that Hellcat well I don't like to do
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.360]  it a lot because I have three children the salesman sold me on it when I was
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:04.560]  just there trading in an old Jeep and because you could get the equivalent of
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:12.440]  a top Ferrari for 120th or 130th the price it just seemed like pure Americana
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.280]  I had to have it and I've driven other people that I know who have 600 horsepower
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:21.360]  Porsches my cousin likes to take his friends really fast car out to the track
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.120]  I haven't done that because I don't want to endanger myself but it is fun to be
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.160]  able to be going 55 and a lonely stretch of highway because I don't like to take
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.440]  off fast from a stop because I can be dangerous and to hit the accelerator and
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.400]  you're going 150 in seconds I mean the car will slam you back in your seat and
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.440]  that's just in regular drive if you put it in a lower gear and hit it it is it's
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.600]  just it's it's it's faster than most NAS cars because they have to dial those
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.080]  back now people get killed in them and it's just an example the rest of the
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.600]  world's I got it because of the little things like easy cars or car to go that
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.960]  are designed not to even really save gas but to just put you in a tin can and
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:09.120]  lower our standard of living as kind of a middle finger to Al Gore and the rest of
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.200]  them as just a piece of Americana and it's kind of why I have 250 caliber
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.360]  rifles you know plus they would they've gone way up in value so they're a good
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.880]  investment if I ever have to I'll sell them to keep the the radio slash network
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:26.160]  going so the Hellcat's war with investment because it basically doubled in
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.360]  value right after I bought it you can buy them for like $63,000 you could I
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.840]  had offers for to buy it on week after I bought it for 120 they wanted to buy it
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.720]  back exactly like legally sell it for the price listed by Dodge or they won't
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.760]  get any more well all of Austin only got like three I hardly ever see them and
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.760]  so now they're coming out with more they're gonna be a lot more but it's
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.040]  just a piece of Americana I kind of treated myself but I think I might
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.040]  actually sell it because God let it on my heart that it's not really prudent
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.120]  for somebody like me that's got so much riding on what I'm doing people
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.240]  counting on me to put myself in something like that but I tell you what I
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.000]  really love about it I'm going to this whole plug about that car I love it like
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.760]  a woman the problem is is that it's absolutely me it doesn't look like
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.040]  anything and it's got you know big backseat put the kids in there I don't
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.920]  like super fancy standout stuff like I love Ferrari's but I even I had the
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:37.240]  money I wouldn't spend it on that but it's just too flashy so the understated
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:41.600]  stealth nature of it and the fact that it's 780 horsepower because it's supposed
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.960]  to be 707 the truth is they tested the drivetrain and they wanted to get under
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.640]  some government standards it's really 780 something horsepower according to
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:54.960]  car and driver and others so you're sitting in a 780 horsepower car it's

[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:11.480]  global absolutely and it I guess it's just judgment we've all gotten corrupt
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.560]  we've gotten decadent myself included nobody's perfect where our government is
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.760]  allowing the secret cell of body parts than trying to deny the little babies
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.520]  they're keeping them alive they're harvesting them I mean the sky's the
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.560]  limit imagine what we don't know that's going on it is about population
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.760]  reduction it is about the humanization it's about the decision by the culture
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:38.560]  that we're crap collectively and we're gonna abort humanity and that's the sick
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.760]  feeling we have is the bottom is falling out and I'm not trying to be
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:51.680]  negative we should be honest about where we are so we can do something about it I
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.360]  appreciate you sorry go ahead okay I don't think they look at us like crap
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:02.160]  unfortunately I think they look at us lesser than this but you know it's
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.160]  kind of I'm not saying anything by this I have a strong father but it's kind of
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.360]  like how in certain ways the father controls the son you know you look at
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.360]  the control you know God controls man father controls the son yeah there's
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.920]  free will but there's still the control we are being fathered and trained by our
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.640]  government father the problem is here is that that father the government father
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.860]  is not in control of himself or herself or the group as a large it's
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:36.520]  intoxicated by his own actions and ego and bound by his mind you're absolutely
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:43.800]  right brother you hit the nail directly on the head appreciate your call cash in
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.880]  Missouri thanks for holding her on the air worldwide I want to ask you a favor
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.320]  Alex but first I'd like to say that my wife and I have been listening to you
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:58.320]  for years and we actually refer to info wars is the real strength media we but
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.520]  we've never heard more financial experts say that the physical cliff is getting
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.760]  closer and closer and closer so with our limited physical assets and our income
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.640]  we're stepping up our prepping mainly we're stocking up on food and water
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:18.280]  silver coins firewood and ammo and a lot of your health products and now we're
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:22.320]  even building a chicken coop but last night we were watching several YouTube
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:27.560]  videos of hundreds and hundreds of tanks on railroad cars and mile-long
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.640]  convoys of armored vehicles and over a dozen different states across America
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.480]  today and I just wonder how many of these soldiers practicing martial law
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.280]  drills will follow the orders to confiscate our guns mow down innocent
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.320]  Americans that they have been brainwashed to believe that that we the people are
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.800]  the enemies of America simply for standing up for our God-given rights but
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:58.120]  my wife and I believe that info wars has become the largest military or has the
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.040]  largest audience of military active duty soldiers as listeners and so info wars
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.720]  has the bully pulpit or maybe better said the anti bully pulpit so here's
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:14.320]  here's my my request is please take at least one day a week to dedicate the
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.280]  entire show or at least the fourth hour now that you have that to look these
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.440]  soldiers in the eye grab their ear and help them see past that compartmentalization
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.840]  and help them connect the dots we may have the guns behind every blade of
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.960]  grass in this country but the military guns are bigger than ours and we've been
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:37.080]  chopping off the tail of this snake but if we had their support and their big
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.040]  guns and their billions of rounds of ammo we could blow the head off of the
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.880]  snake and the top of the pyramid where these Satanist bankers make high we
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.760]  believe that the good military outmembers the bad military members so well
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.760]  that's definitely true and look but the globalist strategy is built around two
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.480]  things we're gonna go to break I'm gonna come back and try to tell what you've
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:04.920]  said historically and why it's not one of the main options we want to go with
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.040]  at least until everybody's educated we've got to get more people educated
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.000]  before you would even look at anything like that but clearly the crimes the
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.840]  people that have taken over well justify removing the people at the top of the
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.480]  government the problem is they're set up for that and set up to stop that and
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:30.200]  set up to demonize that so there's alternatives see you look at how their
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:36.880]  attack defense profiles set up then you find their weaknesses and it's two
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.680]  fold and we'll break it down when we come back I bless you sir we appreciate
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.640]  you cash we'll be back stay with us
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:55.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:30:03.760]  network will Donald Trump sign the GOP pledge precluding a third-party run
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.600]  according to a close associate the GOP candidate intends to sign the loyalty
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.080]  pledge that would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.000]  preclude him a third-party run the Republican National Committee has made
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.240]  it clear that they want every candidate running for nomination to sign a pledge
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:25.440]  not to break off and run as a third-party candidate under any circumstances the
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.200]  GOP is worried that third-party campaigns will jeopardize the party's
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.520]  chances against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate and as he's
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:37.680]  currently the most popular candidate the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.280]  break off from the pact and he has repeatedly threatened to do so Republican
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.360]  presidential candidate Rand Paul reminded everyone that it was Ross Perot who
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.480]  ended up giving us the first Clinton and if Trump breaks off he could give us

[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:54.920]  national exercise and it just says in the document that we're preparing to
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.560]  basically take on the tea party and the number one enemies of the government
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.920]  and it's just completely treasonous it's what you think you'd see in a science
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.040]  fiction movie like they find the document the government's planning to go
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.600]  after real Americans who stand for the Bill of Rights and Constitution it's a
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.400]  martial law plan oh my gosh get this information to the president he'll
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:19.560]  stop the group in Congress but instead it's just that's out in the open yeah the
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:28.080]  armored vehicles over the constitutionalist and it's just like wow because
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:33.160]  we know they're the takeover we know they're the criminals and so it just
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.160]  becomes open and shut it's just completely cut and dry and now they're
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.720]  pushing groups to say kill the police to start a civil war I mean they're just so
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.960]  villainous it's gotten the point where I almost can't even talk about anymore in
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:53.840]  fact I'm not doing this for theatrics I'm not doing this to I love doing this
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.680]  radio show and I just really enjoy it and I love fighting tyranny I love
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:05.160]  covering issues but some days it doesn't happen very often I get in here and I
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:11.560]  look at the girls from the Gardasil shot having convulsions and at a certain
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:18.000]  point I can't be on air in fact I just told them during the break go get Rob do
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.120]  he does a great job he can interview this lawyer about the police and
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.160]  everything that's happening in studio and then they can do a whole fourth hour
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.200]  if they don't have to do it today I just can't be here and you know what I
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.960]  think it's really just gotten to that point where the evil is so over the top
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:44.280]  I just need to go pray for a few hours and I just need to really get my head
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.800]  screwed on straight because every indicator is something big is about to
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:52.720]  happen and it's like the last caller said
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.080]  you know wow you really are this is the tip of the spear and then there's that
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:04.040]  realization of I don't feel worthy to be sitting here talking to tens of millions
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.720]  of people and I don't know what the lever is we pull or what we do to try to
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:15.360]  stop these people it's like watching a giant evil spider with big stinking
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:20.280]  fangs creeping towards little babies in their cribs and it's already eaten a
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.560]  whole bunch of them because he's a little suck dry skeletons with the skin
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.320]  sucked on to the face and the eyes sucked in and the spiders singing this
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:33.400]  evil happy song and then it goes over to the next baby and sucks it dry and the
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:39.080]  next one and I mean spiritually that's what it's like watching it and then
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.960]  just covering this and sitting here I just I get to the point where I can't
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.440]  look at it anymore I feel like I should go out in the desert for you know six
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  months or something or the mountains and just get my head straight and what to do
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.600]  about these people I just can't handle it anymore I mean God they're so bad and
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:02.040]  they've gotten us in a trance where we're just accepting what they do by
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.960]  increment to now all this incredibly macabre stuff is out brain damaged
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.880]  children everywhere body parts of dead babies being sold open borders total
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:17.080]  insanity world government GMO killing the rats they feed it to fluoride in the
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:22.800]  water all these giggling simpering trendies banning free speech but there's
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.440]  good news taking place you know I'm gonna go to some phone calls I got my
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.600]  video list here I saw this a few days ago but it's back in the news today where
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.880]  Missouri teenagers protest a transgender student use of the girls bathroom and
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.360]  it's just some it's some guy there by nose in the school and now he's in the
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.280]  girls bathroom and the argument is OB nice of what he thinks he is but the
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.480]  truth is with all the issues in the world this is just an assault to confuse
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.720]  everybody and and create you know all these problems like making taxpayers pay
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:38:00.680]  for sex changes it's just all part of the weird fog that's injected and I see
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.960]  students protesting having to wear biometric ID cards and stuff the
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:09.560]  students are fighting back they get what's happening they're saying no and
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.400]  the number one issue in America is not men with a bunch of chemicals and I'm
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.000]  thinking they're women and I don't dislike these people that are like this
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.920]  don't don't don't bring me down to that level of of of actually buying into all
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:31.320]  this it's just complete fruitcake land this country is being sabotaged I mean
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.200]  they've spent how many hundreds of billions on a fighter plane that didn't
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:40.840]  even as good as an F-16 that's all to sabotage everything to end human flight
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:46.320]  it's all going robot human programs are being sabotage I've had top astronauts
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:52.080]  on repeatedly concurring humans are being sabotaged humans are being
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.600]  sabotaged you call whatever you want some you know weird globalist projection
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.320]  because they hate themselves so they hate the general public want to eradicate
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.640]  us or it's the devil or it's whatever it is that's what's going on our
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.840]  prosperity our will our creativity our honor is so great that if we just stand
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:15.280]  up for what's good humans can transcend we are incredible we're made the image
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:20.920]  of God but instead we are watching the great sink we're watching the great
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:31.240]  fall and it's it's just absolutely unspeakable so let's go to this piece
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:43.240]  let's go to this piece right here out of the local news KMOV here it is but why
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:47.960]  would you want to I mean I think it's good when you say somebody's a he or a
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:53.160]  she and then he called me that kind of tells somebody something if you go I'm
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.640]  gonna go meet Z somebody's thinking you're meeting somebody from a different
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.800]  planet I guess for some like state representative Bill Dunn it's a foreign
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:06.600]  concept using words like Z instead of he or she but UT vice chancellor of
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.760]  diversity and inclusion says these pronouns have been around for a while
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.000]  and they have been part of campaigns and dialogues at other campuses in the
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.360]  country they're not so new they've been around you know if you do a Google
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.120]  search for under inclusive language you know what to come up it's a way to be
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.960]  respectful of students who identify as gender and non-conforming I thought
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:34.080]  somebody was sending an email around that that somebody was just you know fooling
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.000]  people with it and then when I found out it was true that we actually have people
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.080]  getting paid a lot of money to sit around and come up with this nonsense
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.080]  during the first week of class UT suggested teachers ask students to provide a
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:49.600]  name and pronoun instead of calling role that's because a name on a roster may
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.800]  not reflect the same gender the student uses now it makes me think about how
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.200]  might this impact climate pursuits who are gender non-conforming how might it
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:05.560]  impact retention you know when people don't feel as though they matter that
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.800]  you're not trying welcome me this is about everyone changing their language
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.480]  getting rid of the English language to adopt cult speak with a weird guy with
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.400]  like weird cult eyes going we want to make them feel like they're included as
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.240]  if so that people start seeing the language as in as going to that it's
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.600]  making the whole school a giant reeducation camp while they're putting
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:33.600]  chemicals in the food to say you're a girl when you're a boy you're a boy when
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.600]  you're a girl and you can't use that language anymore and it's happening all
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.400]  over the country and I'm grieving what's happening what you're seeing with me
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:46.680]  here on air is an ongoing situation where I constantly have guilt that I'm
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.960]  not figuring out what to do with this incredible platform that I'm not doing
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.680]  enough to articulate to people just how over the top all this is and I know you
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:02.240]  know but it really does take getting retrospective and getting off the
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:07.360]  treadmill of life getting off the hamster wheel and really getting down to
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.040]  brass tacks because I'm a guy that doesn't go to calls but most the time
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.640]  doesn't have a lot of gas because I like to talk I love to cover news but
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.200]  every once in a while when this stuff really hits me and it's happening more
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.520]  often it is incredibly painful like watching my family killed in a firing
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.080]  squad to focus on these people and I just need to get out in nature and I just
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:36.320]  need to just pray to God because the betrayal of this age and the evil that's
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:43.600]  rising I can feel it in my soul and I just want to live in peace with everybody
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.200]  I want to see humans work together and I know you want to see that as well we
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.840]  have very bad people that don't let's back this up 10 seconds and go back to
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:59.000]  this bizarre old person I mean this is just some of the most disgusting brain
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.480]  washing and I told you they'll start getting rid of the language this is it
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.720]  this is a real cult takeover this is what the colleges are putting out what
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.480]  the churches are putting out this is the big move the pope's about to show up
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:17.240]  he's saying abortions okay it's no problem world government's good I mean
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.200]  you're seeing the globalist uncloak they're making their moves something
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:24.960]  big's about to happen is it a big war worldwide financial class probably all
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.440]  of it we've been holding them back holding them back they finally decided
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:35.520]  to make their move the battle's on let's go to the clip I need to sit around and
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:38.960]  come up with this nonsense during the first week of class UT suggested
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:43.120]  teachers asked students to provide a name and pronoun instead of calling role
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.440]  that's because a name on a roster may not reflect the same gender the student
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:53.360]  uses now it makes me think about how might this impact climate for students
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.960]  who are gender non-conforming how might it impact retention you just got to
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.680]  think about that when people don't feel as though they matter that you're not
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.240]  trying to be welcoming while the university says it's about inclusion and
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.720]  sensitivity others believe it's taking things a little too far people need to
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:17.920]  toughen up they probably need to have the office of suck it up oh man so again
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.720]  they get everybody to be inclusive which most people are I mean whatever live
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.880]  let live most Americans are libertarian at heart and major surveys they're not
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:28.720]  Democrat or Republican you ask them dry questions that identifies libertarian
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:35.960]  I mean America's been the freest country ever in many respects but that's not
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:42.920]  what this is that's not what this is this is change the language mother father
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:49.320]  boy girl he she this is trying us to talk exactly how they say I told you it
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.400]  wasn't whacked out we're when they said we're gonna ban brown bags or don't use
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:45:00.200]  the term brown bag I told you it was whacked out when again it supposedly
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.760]  comes off as whacked out I'm saying it's not whacked out it's scientifically
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:11.400]  designed and we're the clutches of these mind warriors just jacking with
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:19.560]  everybody cold-bloodedly they don't adopt and believe what they've been pushing
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:34.000]  what they've been doing no they absolutely think their gods are gonna
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.520]  emerge with machines and live forever and all this other crazy garbage that
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.560]  we've covered here where they say it themselves I mean I'm not really coming
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.360]  up with any of this on my own I've just read what they have to say and it's
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.960]  crazy and what's even crazier is the general public is faced with this and
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.720]  they think it's a joke they think it's funny it's not the next segment we're
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:58.320]  gonna air John bounds were neutron bombs used in Yemen if you're a radio

[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.440]  with myself it's kind of a ridiculous question you have how do they get away
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.320]  with how do they think they're gonna get away with George Bush murdered a
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:03.720]  million Muslim you know he and Donald Rumsfeld Paul Wolfowitz and how did they
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:09.400]  get away you know Ronald Reagan brought you know thousands of pounds of cocaine
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.680]  into the black community how did he get away with Lyndon Johnson lied about the
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.560]  incident in the Gulf of Tonkin led to a million and a half can't be in the
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.560]  meetings and fifty-eight thousand dead Americans how did he get away with because
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.640]  they always get away with now the reason I called is because I'm gonna take
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.320]  issue with you about what you've been saying about minister Farrakhan because
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:36.080]  you've been being just people okay if you play what he said what he said is
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:41.960]  absolutely on point he said if we are murder but if you could probably tell
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:47.360]  the black guy if we are murder and we have no retreat from the federal
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:55.480]  government we should talk and hunt and kill those who kill now you have
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:01.000]  attempted to take what you know that was integrated in clearly at police in
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.360]  general not at the actual close and I've said I agree with a lot of stuff was
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:08.720]  fair con says was fair con said he agreed with my 1776 comment there's some
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.480]  stuff I disagree with I think that rhetoric from my perspective I
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.560]  disagree with your perspective I don't think he's calling for as much as the
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:21.400]  blog talk radio guy saying go out and kill cops clearly but I mean I took that
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.720]  as just in general they are white they are cops and I agree there's a bunch of
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.280]  globalists that are above the law and I've made films about Lyndon Johnson and
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.600]  the bushes and the cocaine drugs being brought in I think Reagan knew about that
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.040]  but George Bush senior was running it I'm so I've exposed that sir I totally
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.840]  agree with you but the thing is I just attack all the stuff that I see is
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.280]  corrupt and I don't think Lewis fair con would be able to get away with that
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.440]  unless he's either intimidated the government which may be or whether he's
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.400]  been given a green light by Obama I mean I played the clip whenever he said
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.280]  that Obama basically murdered Gaddafi and it was wrong that was absolutely true
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:00.000]  so I just call like I see it you may disagree with me that's fine I mean
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.120]  either Lewis fair con is just really angry and wants to go ahead and have a
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:08.400]  war which I cannot you know get that or he's with the globalist and I don't know
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:14.160]  which one it is what do you think it is you you can't you can't take what he
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.320]  says out of context you constantly complain about MSNBC CNN taking things
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:24.240]  you say out of context what he said in context is absolutely correct and I
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.320]  promise you if some cop holds your wife over and put a gun on her head and blew
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:33.560]  her head off and you had no redress from the Department of Justice the federal
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:38.320]  government anybody else you would take matters into your own hands also yeah
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.440]  well I would take my matters into my own hands I would take matters in my own
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.880]  hands against the individual I wouldn't do it with a cop pumping gas that's
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:54.120]  exactly what he said he said kill those who kill us that is specific to go after
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:59.120]  the individual that I was saying it in the context that he should condemn the
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:03.200]  Black Lives Matter chant of give the pigs wings and all that stuff he should
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:06.800]  condemn people shooting innocent cops in the back of the head and then say
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:10.880]  specifically that the people getting away with murder need to get in trouble
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:14.440]  like I said the cops shoot the Hispanic shooting the Hispanic for no reason in
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:18.640]  San Antonio better get in trouble or the white cops shooting the black guy only
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.840]  getting two years that was a travesty of justice I agree with you on a lot of
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:28.000]  those points but in the main debate the way fair cons been taken for a month and
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.960]  once he said that the change reaction began so I can see your point I think
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.680]  it's fair but I think it's fair from my perspective I'm not being deceitful or
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:38.800]  twisting here's the clip itself
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:49.960]  so if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs then we must
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:59.040]  rise up and kill those who kill us stop them and kill them what's happening
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.920]  that comes in stock to kill feel the pain okay that's enough we're ready to play
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.400]  it twice your state now let's before I'll let you have another word sir but I
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.600]  just want to finish up with us since you're articulate and make some decent
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.720]  points and I could see 30% of what you're saying I could have said it even
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.760]  better that's the part of this I'm just exhausted the sick of it you know at a
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.800]  fundamental level hearing white people are bad white people are gonna pay
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:24.440]  that doesn't intimidate me it makes me upset and then I know what weak minded
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:28.320]  people are gonna do they're gonna do some bad things so I'm very very sad I'm
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.840]  very very nauseated he's following the narrative that's why I said he might be
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.600]  in with the feds of where Al Sharpton said the goals to get the feds to come
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.600]  in and federalize police remember that clip two months ago when the feds
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.560]  themselves have been taken over by the globalist and the feds are the ones that
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:49.840]  killed the millions of Muslims that I was against and that's the feds funding
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:55.200]  the Wahhabi is right now to kill the non-radical Muslims so so that's what's
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:59.200]  going on and he's saying feds better come in and do something about this or
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.920]  we're gonna go after the people he's talking about locals and the locals
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.800]  are a patchwork a good departments bad departments mediocre departments some
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:10.240]  good some bad and it's just I mean I disagree with you fundamentally about
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.840]  the overall thing he's saying I can see your perspective but if you're honest I
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.280]  think you can see my perspective but go ahead you got 60 seconds this is the
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:22.680]  problem okay
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:30.040]  since the 1970s okay cold-cushed crew apricot bambada there are songs from
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:35.920]  the 70 rap songs about cops murdering black people okay in the movie the
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:41.280]  party the lean out of the caprio mark warwick talk about how Irish police
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.640]  men join the force so they can split a nigga's head open this is not our
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.080]  imagination you I have been living under tyranny when it comes to police for
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:54.480]  the last 10 15 years we've been living under it but decades and we're sick of
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:54:00.080]  my son but this past summer he's 17 years old we live in a decent middle-class
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.560]  stable it he walks home from the pool with his friends he's been approached by
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:11.880]  a police this summer here it's harassment and it's because and it's
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:16.760]  because of a lot of different factors old customs racism things like that but
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.680]  also movements the gangster hip-hop culture pushed by MTV the the whole
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:25.680]  cop-killing narrative then gets stereotyped and projected onto your son
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:29.880]  which is going to get worse I'm saying the cold-blooded social engineers sir
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.880]  are manipulating us all against each other I tell you what I'm gonna do Rob
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:38.560]  do is coming up I got to check out of here this is just too depressing and I
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:41.840]  do this every once in a while I'm checking out of here we're gonna hold
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.360]  you over after this John Bowne report and then Rob do will come back in that
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.080]  first five minutes segment let you finish up then we got a guest coming in
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:51.680]  and I'm gonna go out I didn't eat breakfast this morning I also got low
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:57.080]  blood sugar so that's part of what happens here so I've got to eat and I
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:08.600]  got to take care of this issue but let's go to John Bowne's report Samuel Cohen
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.080]  the inventor of the neutron bomb once said the question I ask of myself was
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:17.240]  something like we're going to go on fighting these damned full wars in the
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.600]  future shelling and bombing cities to smithereens and wrecking the lives of
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:25.920]  their surviving inhabitants might there be some kind of nuclear weapon that
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.080]  could avoid all this Cohen went on to invent a hydrogen bomb without the
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:41.440]  uranium 238 real early on I began to see radiation nuclear radiation as an
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:50.160]  effective means of waging ground warfare in a relatively moral way because the
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:55.240]  neutron bomb is the most discriminant weapon ever devised there's a very
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:03.560]  sharp cut off between the radius out to which the enemy will be killed and
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:08.560]  where the friendly troops are positioned the neutron bomb would
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:13.320]  essentially increase the radiation output to as high as 80% without the
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.120]  massive destructive blast the relatively small kill zone would spread into
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:22.880]  enemy troops liquefying their living tissue with the emitted massive dose of
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:27.360]  neutrons in 1975 the Ford administration under the guidance of
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:32.080]  Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger proceeded to build the neutron bomb
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:37.200]  protests in an arms race soon followed anti-nuke president Jimmy Carter dropped
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.960]  the program but president Ronald Reagan eagerly supported it saying very simply
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:46.400]  it is the dreamed of death ray weapon of science fiction it kills enemy soldiers
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.640]  but doesn't blow up the surrounding countryside or destroy villages towns and
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:55.240]  cities here is a deterrent weapon available to us at a much lower cost than
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:00.080]  trying to match the enemy gun for gun tank for tank plane for plane however
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:05.160]  support for the neutron bomb had changed by the time Reagan took office and
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.800]  military leaders were skeptical of its use on the battlefield and the potential
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:15.080]  it had to affect civilians plus the bomb had only reached a small percentage of
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.920]  its intended neutron radiation output the bombs were then dismantled by the
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:26.400]  Bush administration or were they back in 2012 UK ex-Defense Secretary Lord
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.560]  Gilbert suggested dropping a neutron bomb on the border of Pakistan and
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.600]  Afghanistan up in the mountains of the borders between Afghanistan and Pakistan
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.440]  nobody living there except a few goats and how many people are having them if you
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.520]  told them that they're going to be some ERRB warheads drop there and very
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.840]  unpleasant place to go they wouldn't go there now as President Obama desperately
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:55.960]  gathers support for his one-sided deal with Iran the Saudis are waging a full
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:58:00.760]  scale campaign of genocide against the people of Yemen among the banned US
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:05.800]  supplied cluster bombs used by Saudi airstrikes there is now unconfirmed
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:11.160]  evidence of a neutron bomb in play who is supplying these bombs remains to be
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:17.520]  seen it could be the US France Israel or China which have all detonated at least
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:23.080]  one neutron bomb the bottom line is Obama's pending deal with Iran will
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:28.640]  only heat up the arms race in the already volatile Middle East John bound for

[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.880]  Lee and Macadoo and Jakari Jackson joining me if you are listening to this

[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:45.680]  slash show and you can watch a video of everything that's going on here you can
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:49.960]  see the studio that was helped paid for by prisonplanet.tv members and also
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.560]  supporters of the info wars store.com we're gonna go back to Nathaniel in South
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:01:00.680]  Carolina who is I was listening to this just this in my office and very angry
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:05.840]  and I and I and I think you know very justified why he's angry I just want to
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.920]  say this before I go back to him if you start a shooting war with the police
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.920]  it's not gonna end well on either side and we have to defeat this with the
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:19.280]  info war using cameras putting this stuff out and just inching forward it's
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:22.880]  not gonna change overnight I can tell you that but Nathaniel go ahead finish
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.880]  with what you were talking about. I can't speak for the the idiot number of
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:33.880]  black lives matter that had that obscure a blog talk radio show that probably 50
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.600]  people didn't hear and so Alex put it on his airwaves and you know millions of
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.320]  people here which you know I got a question with the motive behind that
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:46.760]  but again we're dealing with an obscure blog talk radio guy that probably didn't
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.000]  have 50 lists okay I'm not defending that you don't indiscriminately go out
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.560]  kill anybody. What minister Farrakhan is talking about is that 12-year-old boy in
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:03.800]  Ohio where the cops roll up and shoot him dead there's no retrace there's no way
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:08.720]  to get justice I absolutely understand taking a weapon and going out and
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:13.920]  serving justice on that police officer on anybody who would kill somebody
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:20.240]  unfairly and indiscriminately without and and them having no redress at the
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:26.160]  family having no redress okay that's what any man would do so my problem is
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.480]  Alex Jones constantly attacks the mainstream media and rightfully so for
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.140]  developing narratives and then running with it whether it's climate change
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.880]  gay rights whatever they're doing well so the right wing media has developed a
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:43.160]  narrative also and they're running with it which is that black lives matters is
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.760]  the new third right if you have some idiot members of that organization
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.920]  talking about murdering people indiscriminately absolutely are they
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:57.060]  funded by so I haven't looked into that but I can assure you it's not an
[02:02:57.060 --> 02:03:02.480]  organization of millions of people looking to kill white people indiscriminately
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.760]  okay just like if you go to any party rally you can say you know the left
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:12.040]  wing will always record the two or three we talk about the Nick Rose and and the
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:16.440]  no-good Mexican and then Alex complains that all of the tea party is
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.080]  playing with that broad brush the same thing here and I didn't even call it to
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.120]  been black lives matter I personally am not concerned with them I'm concerned
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:29.080]  with taking with minutes the fire concept and twisting it and then tying it
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:33.640]  with that idiot at black lives matter said they're two completely different
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.960]  things okay completely different and that's indefensible he can't complain
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.720]  about his words being taken out of context when it comes to the Boston
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:47.600]  bombing and being deeply racist and then he twists the words of somebody up
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:54.920]  that's my issue okay I understand how dealing with the police and and things
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:04:00.440]  of that nature I can't do this for my son well I am Nathaniel I could tell you
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:05.480]  this this what what that that radio talk show that we played that that was not
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:09.560]  an isolated incident we have video that we shot ourselves of a open carry march
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.120]  and it wasn't I don't think it was the new Black Panthers it was a different
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:17.920]  group but they were shouting the same things while they were armed I think it
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.400]  was only going bang bang that's that's what they were saying and there is
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.880]  there's other talk shows and those were new Black Panthers that were saying you
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:30.200]  know you should go out and it's gonna be open season on white people this is not
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.720]  a isolated incident but I hear what you're saying too I mean this is why we
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.960]  have to come together and have this open discourse and I thank you for calling
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:42.920]  we're gonna be back with Attorney Adam Lowry to talk about a case of you know
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:49.440]  where the police murdered a guy shot him in the neck just for going to a bank so

[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.360]  hardest the heart most hardcore radio station or radio show in the country

[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:36.480]  hours and this is my guest Adam Lowey does that pronounce that right? Lowey sorry
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.000]  he's gonna be joining us yeah I'm gonna and I'm gonna get to his story and he's
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.680]  he's an attorney representing the family of Larry Jackson and this was a story
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.680]  that no about two years ago hit Austin let Mr. Jackson went into a bank trying
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:55.880]  to try to cash a check or do something do some business at the bank the doors
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:59.880]  were locked he was confronted by a police officer he ran off there's a
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:04.280]  scuffle and I'll let Adam tell you more about it coming up in the
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:08.240]  fourth hour I'm gonna show some of the shocking video that I posted yesterday
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:14.160]  on info wars.com of the young girls in Mexico convulsing on the floor after
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:19.840]  receiving HPV shots and there's at least 10 to 15 girls on the floor having
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:25.040]  these convulsion attacks and this is just one of the ways people are being
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:29.240]  attacked is through these soft kill vaccines another way is through overzealous
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:34.280]  warrior cops who come after people and and are trying to be judge jury and
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:38.040]  executioner all at once we saw this earlier in the week when we showed the
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:43.560]  video of the the man being killed in San Antonio put his hands up and he gets
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:47.800]  shot he is standing still with his hands up for at least two seconds and he was
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:53.320]  murdering cold blood but first I want to go to that video from KXAN that give
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:55.880]  it'll give you a little bit of context of the story it's a couple years old now
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.480]  so let's run that video you can see around four o'clock that afternoon Larry
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:05.000]  Jackson Jr. peers into a bank it had been robbed earlier that morning after he
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.080]  speaks to a bank employee detective Kleiner walks out of the bank and starts
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.800]  talking to Jackson two minutes later Jackson decides to take off you can see
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.600]  Kleiner run after him from three different camera angles the chase ended
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:23.240]  near Shull Creek with Jackson shot dead prosecutors have charged Kleiner with
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.320]  manslaughter his lawyers say his gun went off accidentally Kleiner is now
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:32.080]  awaiting a decision from a federal judge about whether the case can be tried in
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.640]  federal court at the time of the bank robbery Kleiner was working on a federal
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:43.320]  task force there you go so overzealous cop I think he
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.320]  commandeered a vehicle too didn't he and it's it absolutely is the worst police
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.280]  shooting case I've handled and I would submit one of the worst police
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:54.280]  shooting cases in this country and I think that's evidenced by the fact there
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.960]  was an indictment over what happened the very quick summary is Larry goes to the
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:04.800]  bank he does run Kleiner chases him Kleiner a senior detective with the
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.960]  awesome police department literally commandeered a civilian car it was an
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:12.960]  older woman something you see in the movie out of a 1970s movie yeah tells
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.480]  her to start driving her testimony as she was terrified she testified she
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:22.240]  didn't even realize or think he was a cop he was going crazy she was telling
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.840]  him to calm down eventually Kleiner saw Larry said stop stop gets out of the car
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.120]  chases him under the bridge what happens under the bridge is he attacks him
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:37.200]  starts beating him and then while Larry was on his hands and knees Kleiner put a
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:41.000]  gun to the back of Larry's neck and pulled the trigger and when I say the
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.720]  back of his neck the autopsy report confirms and we saw the body there is
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.920]  literally a muzzle imprint that was on the back of his neck it was an
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:54.960]  execution style killing and he murdered him I think that the indictment while we
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:58.640]  are grateful there at least was an indictment the indictment is wrong it
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.400]  should not have been a manslaughter indictment it was not an accident it was
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:07.320]  not reckless it was intentional and it was deliberate and I think that because
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:10.680]  of those facts it's without question the worst police shooting in the history of
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.120]  this city and one of the worst in the nation and so you've had to deal with
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:19.240]  the city and the police department in this what are some of the things that are
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:23.680]  not coming out about this case that you can see publicly in press and on TV but
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:27.080]  that they're not really telling you that you know of well the the biggest thing
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:31.920]  is the position of Larry's body what you hear the narrative from the city and
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:35.680]  the police department is this was an accidental shooting they keep repeating
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.240]  that it clearly was not accidental and there's a lot of reasons why it was not
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.080]  accidental was he handcuffed he was not handcuffed and here's an important point
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.880]  to the grand jury testimony has leaked or was filed by the district attorney's
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:54.040]  office Kleiner himself in the grand jury testimony stated that Larry Jackson
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.520]  was not a threat so unlike other police shooting cases where the police officer
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:02.400]  says this guy was a threat I was in danger Kleiner it's not saying that
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.800]  here so he wasn't a threat he was shot in the back of the neck and he was on his
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:12.360]  hands and knees when he was shot and I think that put together the city and the
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.360]  police department simply have not educated the public about what happened
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:20.360]  here I will tell you if it wasn't for the work of my law firm and the forensic
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.040]  experts that we've hired this family would have never known the actual facts
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:27.960]  here we have gone done extensive investigation and done a lot of
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:31.960]  reconstruction about how he would have had to been shot if he was shot in the
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:35.000]  way the bullet went through his body and we have no doubt that he was on his
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.320]  hands and knees and you know this goes by there was another case in I think
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:44.800]  Oakland where the cops were arresting some people I don't I don't know all the
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.880]  details of it but the guy he says he was pulling at his taser to tase a guy and
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:51.720]  he shot him through the back and killed him right he used his gun it was the
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:55.560]  ox Oscar Grant case this is actually fairly similar to that in certain
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.480]  respects except there's video of that right there was there was video of that
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:03.720]  and that officer was eventually convicted this is different I think this
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.400]  case is much worse than that case because I think this was so deliberate he was
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.480]  tracked down I think the Oscar Grant case was one in which the officer
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:15.920]  literally was unjustified in the use of force but it was a type of situation
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:20.560]  that evolved very quickly this was a case in which the situation evolved
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:24.680]  quickly due to the actions of a police officer that was out of control and so I
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.640]  think it's absolutely one of the worst cases we have seen here and I'm very
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:34.560]  cautious about how this thing's gonna play out and I'm very nervous about how
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:39.280]  or whether this officer is going to have to face a jury over this and so
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:42.000]  there people they're trying to get this case thrown out right how is that
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.160]  working so the police officer he had worked for the police department Austin
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.160]  Police Department but he also was on a federal task force and there's a lot of
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.920]  these federal task force around related to a variety of things but because of
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:59.840]  that he and his lawyers were able to argue he has what's called supremacy
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:05.000]  clause immunity and this is a type of immunity that literally is from the 1800s
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.160]  there's literally only about 20 cases about this type of immunity and in short
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:14.240]  what it is it was created for when we were a frontier nation and the federal
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.840]  government was worried about peace officers federal agents doing something
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.880]  in the West and being prosecuted in state court the government at the time
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.280]  said no they should be prosecuted in federal court they should have the
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.000]  protection of a federal court and so what's happening now is that this officer
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.960]  who killed a resident in Austin who is a Austin resident the case should be in
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:39.320]  Austin he was able to remove it to federal court and the problem with that
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.600]  is he is trying to argue he has supremacy clause immunity which means if
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:48.960]  it's granted he cannot be prosecuted for manslaughter that is the current
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:53.160]  argument before the court and sadly they have some cases to support that I'm
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:57.480]  confident that the judge is going to let this go to a jury but you never know
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:02.280]  just the very fact we have to worry about this is very disturbing I think it
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:08.240]  shows the lengths in which it is so difficult to hold government accountable
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:13.160]  when they kill someone obviously if I killed a police officer I would have no
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:17.720]  immunity claim I would be prosecuted first-screen murder as I should be but
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.400]  in this case you have an officer who clearly committed a crime who wasn't
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:25.120]  dead for manslaughter but he's allowed to use all of these defenses these
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:29.960]  immunity defenses which I think are very troubling very troubling and I think
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:33.560]  that's something we're going to see more in the future as you see the federal
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:36.560]  government and state governments especially in the police forces coming
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:40.680]  together you're going to see a lot more of this well hey I'm on a federal task
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:43.880]  force I can do certain things that I couldn't do as a police officer but now
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:46.840]  I can do them because I have this federal protection and they seem to be
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.760]  using this the federal government does it if you go out into the to the woods and
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:54.360]  in a force a Forest Service guy comes up these guys think they have the power of
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:58.320]  God right there it's a very little understood part of the law unless you
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:01.800]  actually deal with it and that is immunity people don't realize the
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:07.160]  government by and large is immune from being held criminally or civilly
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:12.160]  responsible for anything they do and it's a long set of laws that's created by
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:15.920]  the government because the government creates the laws right it's it's fairly
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:19.120]  obvious one if you do something to a federal agent it's like worse than if
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:22.360]  you were to do it just to it another person absolutely if you go up and hit a
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.240]  regular person in the jaw it's it's assault if you go up and do it to a
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:29.960]  federal officer it's assault of a federal officer and that takes there's
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.720]  more penalties than that correct and I think that there's some arguments as to
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.720]  why the government should be protected legally from a situation like you
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:41.280]  described but the problem is on the other side of the coin when the government
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:47.200]  kills mm-hmm and to have the local authorities be so inhibited from getting
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:51.160]  this guy convicted have so many hurdles to get over it's almost like they've
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:55.600]  created a situation in which they are dissuading district attorneys from
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:59.080]  bringing these cases against police officers because the district attorney's
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:01.920]  office is going to think this is going to be really difficult we're not going
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:06.400]  to be able to do this so they let that pass they get a no-bill they forget about
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:10.120]  it and so that's why this case is so important no matter how it plays out I
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:14.120]  think it is very important that this case goes to a jury trial I think it will
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:19.320]  be a travesty of justice if this officer is allowed to get off literally get off
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:22.560]  on an immunity defense and I think it needs to go to a jury trial we're going
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.120]  to see I think I think we'll find out is the officer currently working now the
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:31.560]  officer actually retired and I put that in quotes retired he was going to face
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:35.960]  a disciplinary hearing and the evidence shows the chief Osservato was going to
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:41.240]  fire him but this officer who is a 20-year veteran elected to retire in
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:46.080]  order to preserve his pension so the city or more specifically the taxpayers
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:51.360]  now are paying this guy $7,000 per month for the rest of his life because he was
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:55.760]  able to preserve his pension and that's really a whole another topic conversation
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:01.560]  that I think is a very sad aspect of this case but he was he is not working in
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:05.480]  law enforcement anymore and he never was officially fired because he retired
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:09.320]  before that happened yeah and they that's that seems to happen in all forms of
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:13.040]  government they know actions about to come down so they either resign or retire
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.800]  so they don't have to face the music they don't have to answer and I'll come
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:20.080]  before grand juries I guess in this case he would if at some point you this case
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:24.120]  does go to trial so what what is the status of the case at this point so the
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:28.080]  status of the case is it is two years old yeah literally over two years now
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.640]  which is really unbelievable if you think about how long that is there is a
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:36.480]  trial set in November but we are all waiting on the immunity decision which
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.000]  should be around October but even if the decision says it has to go to trial we
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.760]  are anticipating that his lawyers will appeal that decision which they
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.080]  legally can do to the Fifth Circuit mm-hmm so I don't see this thing ending for
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:52.240]  another year or two oh wow well we're gonna be back here with Adam Loewe

[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:17.400]  we are back live it's the Alex Jones show I'm your host Rob do join Adam
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:21.160]  lowey he's with me he's an attorney representing the family of Larry Jackson
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:26.840]  who was killed by an Austin police detective back in 2013 for simply not
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:30.900]  wanting to sit there and be hassled as he was going through his daily business
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:36.480]  and of course the cops did kind of run a demonization campaign against him after
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:42.040]  they said he had passed indiscretions and yeah that's that's always the MO
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:45.680]  and a police shooting case you're not an angel so therefore absolutely shot in
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:49.200]  the neck the police automatically will pull the criminal record they will
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.240]  automatically contact their mainstream media sources haven't put it out there
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:57.240]  and make no mistake about it it's planned it's deliberate they know what
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:02.040]  they're doing and so in this case they claim that he went to the bank to commit
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:06.120]  an identity theft that he was going to pass a fake check or had a fake ID and
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.640]  that they had this whole story about what he was going to do but here's the
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.440]  interesting thing there was a guy with him that they know was with him they
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.040]  were looking for him they eventually arrested this guy that other guys never
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:20.960]  been charged so they're telling the public that this was some sort of bank
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.800]  robbery or an identity theft a federal crime but his alleged partner has never
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:30.320]  been charged the truth of the matter it wasn't and when you start looking at
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:34.120]  start digging into the details I think that what you pointed out is correct they
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:39.160]  will always attack the character of the victim because it helped shape the
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:43.160]  narrative in how they were going to have this thing play out right and it also
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:46.920]  stops the the public response like well maybe maybe he was a bad guy maybe we
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:51.440]  should just stand down there was just a it looks like they had a protest at
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:56.960]  the end of August here were you involved in that and that was a meeting a
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.040]  panel that the mayor was on that I was on that the police chief was on over
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.360]  700 people showed up it was extremely well attended there were some protesters
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.680]  but most of all it was a pretty good dialogue and I think by you know I've
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.800]  done this for 10 years and I've been a lot of these town hall type meetings five
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:17.840]  years ago you would have had 50 people there now you have 700 people there I
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:22.120]  think that it's obvious this is a huge issue for people not just in the
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.440]  minority communities which it's been an issue for decades for those folks but
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:30.880]  so-called white America now realizes how bad this issue is and I think we're
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:35.160]  living a very interesting and important time in our nation's history because of
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:39.360]  that well that and people getting on social media and making a stink about
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:42.640]  stuff like this right and in all the different avenues that you have you know
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:45.800]  you have email lists you have newsletters you have Facebook Twitter I
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:48.880]  mean you could just go on and on and you keep flooding it out there and you
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:53.080]  keep people aware of what's going on and that that gets them interested instead
[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:55.960]  of like well I should just go and watch TV well maybe I should go get involved
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.240]  in something about my community because maybe I don't want to be on the wrong
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:03.760]  end of a gun at some point because I was just walking up to a bank and that's the
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.440]  big thing if you think about five years ago especially ten years ago if you had
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:12.560]  a police shooting you would have the shooting the police narrative and then
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:17.600]  the media would control the entire narrative the media relies exclusively
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.360]  for their sources on the police so they're gonna repeat what the police
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:25.600]  say the difference now is with Twitter with social media with shows like y'all
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.680]  have here there's other voices the people can listen to and that's why it's a
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:34.200]  truly revolutionary time because it's people don't just have to accept what
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:38.640]  the government's telling them and that generally was the case until the rise of
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:41.840]  the Internet exactly and there are no government officials here telling us
[02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:45.760]  what to say although they probably like to do that we're gonna take calls in the
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:49.080]  next segment Adam you ready for that you ready here's I have callers all right
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:53.680]  we had Samuel earlier who was very very angry and I think justifiably so but I
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.760]  want callers who are coming up we got Dion, Kristen, Chris and Jimmy I want you
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:02.720]  guys to have a a question or comment for the guest and and then if you want to
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:07.080]  bring up something else real quick or you know ancillary to that feel free to
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:10.080]  but he's worked with you've worked on CPS cases you've worked in police
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:12.760]  brutality cases like what are some of the cases you've you've done in your
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.840]  career the main focus what I do is personal injury which is the traditional
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:21.080]  car crash truck crash things of that sort the subspecialty I have is police
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:25.120]  brutality so I've handled everything from wrongful imprisonment police
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:29.920]  shootings taserings I was on the show about a year ago when Noe Nino de
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:34.360]  Rivera was tased in a high school in Bastrop who was the young man that was
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:38.680]  taking his head brain injury and so we look at all cases and we've handled many
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:42.000]  of them and they're very important cases they're very important cases most
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.800]  lawyers will not touch these cases needless to say these cases are very
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:49.560]  difficult you're suing the government you're up against public opinion you
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:54.240]  have issues of race you must deal with when you try these cases because often
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.800]  especially here in federal court the jury is generally all white and generally
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.120]  it's minority victims and so it makes it very complicated but I think it's
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.760]  extremely important that these cases are brought because the government must be
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:10.520]  held accountable and if the government is not held accountable in some way the
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:13.520]  government will continue to do worse things and so I think that's why these
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:17.520]  cases are so important and you know what the work you're doing isn't flashy it's
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:21.000]  not exciting I mean I guess when you're in the courtroom it is but the overall
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.280]  general approach but this is the way we have to do this if we're gonna live in a
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:28.720]  civilized society we have to follow the rules that are set up and do it the
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:33.240]  right way but you can get justice I think if you really work at it our guest
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:38.440]  Adam Lowey Adam Lowey we'll be right back it's Rob do with the info wars dot
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:44.600]  com Alex Jones show and we'll be right back after this short break stay tuned

[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:04.560]  will Donald Trump sign the GOP pledge precluding a third-party run according to
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:09.120]  a close associate the GOP candidate intends to sign the loyalty pledge that
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:12.840]  would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would preclude him a
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:16.720]  third-party run the Republican National Committee has made it clear that they
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:20.880]  want every candidate running for nomination to sign a pledge not to
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:25.360]  break off and run as a third-party candidate under any circumstances the
[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:29.560]  GOP is worried that third-party campaigns will jeopardize the party's chances
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:33.440]  against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate and as he's
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:37.600]  currently the most popular candidate the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:41.320]  break off from the pact and he has repeatedly threatened to do so
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:45.480]  Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul reminded everyone that it was Ross
[02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:50.040]  Perot who ended up giving us the first Clinton and if Trump breaks off he could

[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:54.240]  ready Jimmy from Michigan you've been holding the longest what is your
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:37:02.440]  question for our guest Adam Lowey hey yeah I was involved with the I've been
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:06.960]  involved with the militia for several years Mark Horky and what have you and
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:13.040]  I was also involved with the Uchari militia which were accused of basically
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.800]  trying to do the same thing that's going on right now in our country yeah they
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:21.640]  put out some interesting videos at one point that looked they looked a little
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:25.200]  suspicious they kind of a green screen whatnot is that is that the videos you're
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:30.760]  referring to I didn't refer to anybody I guess I refer to them but is that the
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:34.760]  same Hattari militia that you're that did they put out those videos oh yeah
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:38.440]  that night the nine people all nine of those people were very good friends of
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.880]  mine they did two years in prison and were let go on me to the day yeah years
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:51.320]  to the day anyway that's beside the point yeah I understand you you know you
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:58.280]  defend people that have been revised by police you probably you know and you see
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:03.360]  that sometimes police officers are justified and absolutely they are how
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:11.240]  do you really look at the case do you decide it on the merits or the
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:16.120]  circumstance because I understand that the the law says one thing but the
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:21.840]  circumstances could certainly say another you know that's what I mean
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.160]  that's what I'm getting that I think it's a very good question and I would
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:29.960]  first answer it by saying that I look at a lot of these cases and I would say
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:34.680]  without a doubt the majority of them are justified meaning that the police
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.240]  officer is justified in the use of force and there's people who do civil rights
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:42.440]  cases who would strongly disagree with that but I don't look at myself as an
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.080]  activist I look at myself as a lawyer and I focus on the facts so I think most of
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:52.640]  the time on cases you often don't hear about there is a justification and so
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:55.960]  when you're talking about the 20% that may not be justified and I think it's
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:02.040]  about that number I think it's a very very fact specific analysis the law very
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:06.520]  much favors the police officer if you look at a jury charge the law is very
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:11.360]  much in the favor of a police officer in what the police officer can say to get
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:16.320]  off and so you must be very careful about what cases you're taking and you
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:20.600]  have to look specifically at each factual circumstance and so I've done this
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:25.160]  long enough to have a pretty good feel on how the case is being reported from
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:29.000]  the beginning what the police officers excuse me what the police department is
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.040]  saying or not saying to raise a red flag in my mind about this this doesn't
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:37.920]  sound right and this is a case that we should look at there you go Jimmy hey I
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:41.760]  got one question for you they those guys were all released afterwards and they
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:44.880]  had no charges after that is that correct it was all like gun charges that
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.800]  ended up getting dropped is that correct no no they did not have there were
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:56.000]  there were they there was three of them that pled guilty to crimes that they
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:05.040]  actually did commit but the but the but the other six were completely set free
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:11.200]  now one of these guys I've known for over 20 years he's now the constable the
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:18.360]  constable I'm not lying he got out of jail ran for constable and won to change
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:24.360]  the system right to work on changing the system from within exactly and and all
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.600]  of them a lot of these people were precinct delegates for the republican
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:32.400]  party where we've been fighting to try and change the republican party for a
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:38.160]  very long time you know and this is what the militia does the militia is
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:44.360]  about citizenship it is not about violence totally agree with you need to
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:49.200]  understand that and anybody that's in the militia right now when you see a cop
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:55.880]  fill him up scarlet death getting stuff in a grocery store whatever watch his
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:02.520]  back because if you do and he understands that he's gonna watch yours when
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:06.680]  all of this breaks down yeah hey that's great advice Jimmy thanks for calling in
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:12.440]  Kristen in PA what is your question thanks for calling yes hi what's up
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:16.000]  thank you for taking my call I just want you guys to know you guys rocked
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:26.320]  seriously I had a question and then for your gentleman guest and then a comment
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:34.440]  do I apologize I lost my train of thought anyway do you I've noticed that a
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:39.880]  lot of these cases you know they dragged them out it seems like they do it on
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:47.440]  purpose trying to get people to forget what you know what it happened you we
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.240]  were just saying that this is already going on over a year it's gonna be two
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:57.240]  to three more years hello so I guess that's your question it what is absolutely
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:03.280]  person spot-on it's a deliberate strategy to delay to drain the pockets I
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:06.880]  think well it's also just so people forget about what happened yeah I mean at
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:11.880]  the end of the day the longer something goes on the more the public doesn't pay
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:16.320]  attention and in this day and age of Twitter of instant media people forget
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:20.600]  so Kristen's exactly right here in Austin they always say that we have six
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:24.320]  months to investigate the shooting and in six months we will report to the
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:29.160]  public what what the results are and then they will often want an extension
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:33.360]  of that six months right and then it'll go six months eight months here's the
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:36.680]  truth of the matter whenever you see a police shooting on television something
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.800]  just happened when the police department comes to the scene they know what
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:45.080]  happened within 20 minutes maybe an hour they always have their top
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:49.440]  investigators on it this stuff is not rocket science it's very obvious what
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:54.280]  happened whether it was a clean shoot whether it was a suspicious shooting the
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:58.160]  very idea this needs to take six months or a long time is nonsense but the
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:02.600]  government does it for Kristen's exact reason so people forget about it then so
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:07.480]  lawyers can wordsmith the investigation and go well we've we've ended up we've
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:10.960]  calculated that there is no culpability in this point right the longer it goes
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:14.520]  on the more it benefits the government people forget about it witnesses
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:17.880]  disappear it's just not that big of an issue I think you've seen that in other
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:22.400]  cities that have made national news and that is an absolute strategy all right
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:29.200]  and Kristen anything else yes I just said I also Alex was talking about some
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:36.400]  things and you know I've my I feel the same way my spirit has been heavily
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:43.320]  heavily burdened here lately and you know I'm a God fearing woman you know I
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:49.320]  read the Bible and always took to look to the Lord first and as much as I want
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:56.800]  to see things change I just see that this is you know things are heading
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:01.920]  predestined you know that that things are going to get so bad that there's
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.560]  only one person who can fix it and that's God and it's it's awesome to see
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:14.400]  people coming together and I do believe that you know the Lord is showing people
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:19.120]  you know the truth and he wants people to take a stand with the you know the
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:24.240]  Planned Parenthood issue with you know the violence on on civilians against the
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:28.360]  police you know the corruption in our government the list goes on and on but I
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.160]  really see more than anything you know we all consistently talk about a great
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:36.480]  awakening happening happening and it's I believe the Lord is showing these
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:41.280]  things he's allowing these things to come to light so that yeah he's casting
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.360]  light on them so they just you know so people good honest people can go hey
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:49.000]  this isn't right we have to take a stand at this point because if we don't we
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.080]  only have ourselves to blame in the end if we sit back and go well you know
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:58.080]  God's gonna take care of it no God is showing us so we take care of it we're
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:01.080]  the ones here we're the ones put here on this earth to take care of it hey
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:05.500]  thanks for calling Kristen really appreciate that how FEMA Region 3 what
[02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:11.880]  is your question hello can hear me yes go ahead yeah I want to start off by
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:16.720]  saying the reason why people need to watch him for worse is one reason and
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.320]  that's because nobody else really understands what the term new world
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:26.000]  order means and can explain it like you guys and until people do they just
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:30.920]  cannot debate your platform on an intellectual level with that being said
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:36.400]  I have a question and then a serious prediction on the next false flag first
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:43.280]  my question is let me start by saying a lot of people get stopped because a cop
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:50.040]  can ask them for their idea whatever but a lot of times there's instances where
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:54.080]  people just get stopped walking in the street where you're not even required to
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:58.800]  have an idea on you and then what do you do at that point you be subservient just
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:04.120]  do what they tell you or do you risk you know getting shot in the back of the
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:08.920]  neck and I have a real prediction after that question all right you answer that
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:12.320]  question and I have a little story about the same about that type of incident
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:15.360]  but go ahead right well I think at the end of the day you need to use common
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:19.360]  sense I understand is someone that practices constitutional law that there
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:22.480]  is a series of rights that the citizens have that they don't have to show a
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:26.400]  police officer an ID they don't have to stand and talk to a police officer so on
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:30.320]  and so forth but at the end of the day if you want to get home I would talk to
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:33.440]  the police officer I mean there's one thing about proving some sort of a
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:37.680]  constitutional principle in theory or in law school when you're debating it well
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:41.920]  you're on the street I would just be respectful to the police officer show
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:47.000]  him the ID and treat him professionally I think a lot of these issues arise and
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.360]  when people don't do that and the whole situation escalates and it gets to the
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.760]  point which the police officer then overreacts yeah do you want to turn it
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:47:00.440]  into a three-year chapter of your life right over an ID and and I'm hey I've
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:04.360]  totally respect people who stand up for their rights I do it there was one
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:07.760]  incident though I was in Detroit Michigan with Aaron Dykes and we were
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:12.320]  shooting B roll a time lapse of the city at night of Detroit and we were at a
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:16.920]  park across across a river actually on a little island and we were shooting this
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:20.520]  footage cops roll up they get out they start talking to us one's a good cop
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:25.320]  one's a bad cop and they want to see ID and and Aaron's like I don't have to
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:29.080]  show you my ID and they're like yes you're actually you don't you're right
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:33.280]  and I actually I just pulled on my idea said I know I don't have to show it to
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.800]  you either but I'm gonna give you this so you will figure out that we're no
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:40.640]  we're no problem here we're all we're doing a shooting video and then you're
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:43.800]  gonna leave us alone they said yeah they looked at my ID handed it back to me
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:46.880]  they got in their car and left right so we could have turned that into a big
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:51.120]  incident but we didn't and we went on with our lives and they went on with
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:53.640]  their lives so there's something to be said with you know using a little bit of
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:59.600]  common sense in these situations so how go ahead with your prediction thank you
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:05.280]  for that answer pretty much got what I was looking for there um yeah what what
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:09.600]  I was predicting though is something that I've been kind of picking up on and a
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:14.840]  lot of subliminals about like an assassination and I know you guys had a
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:18.840]  guest on I can't remember who it was predicted that whenever the final
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.920]  false flag came in it was actually gonna be in female region three where I'm
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:29.760]  calling from and then it's just all this weird timing in September and with
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:35.720]  Obama going to Alaska to shoot this weird episode with Bear Groves in Alaska
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:41.120]  and change in the Mount McKinley yeah research to President McKinley was and
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:46.640]  there were some striking coincidences between similarities between McKinley
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:54.440]  and Obama and McKinley was assassinated in his second term of presidency by a
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:59.440]  don't say it was a guy named Denali if you say that I'm gonna freak out
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:05.720]  yep and with the pope coming in Philadelphia which is in female region
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.360]  three that was my question yes I just I just thought that basically this is how
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:13.480]  I predicted a long time how that how would go down was that it would be an
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:20.080]  assassination on somebody like a sniper assassination and that person would be
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:23.920]  wounded everybody would think he was dead but really he would be in critical
[02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:28.240]  condition for a while and I'm not sure what happened after that and that's my
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:32.040]  prediction and thanks a lot you guys love you guys all right we'll mark it as
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:36.520]  a prediction and if it comes to pass you will be known as a profit how in female
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:41.140]  region three see who's next here Scott in Nebraska what is your question for our
[02:49:41.140 --> 02:49:45.960]  guest Adam Lowy I've got the statement then I got two questions
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:49.960]  they've been using these false flags and this MK ultra they've been winding them up
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:54.960]  and basically starting a war you know and they're starting a war now between
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:58.480]  the police Department military and the citizens the ultimate goal the
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:05.600]  confiscations the gun to confirm to conform to the New World Order and you
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:08.440]  know Obama's saying the same thing that we got to be like the rest of the world
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:12.640]  that nobody can have guns and all that and ultimately that's gonna end up with
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:17.000]  the mark of the beast where you have to have a mark to the fire cell don't we
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:21.120]  need an army of lawyers to stop this war because when we're talking military
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:25.400]  and police we're getting dangerously close here and the other part of this
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:31.520]  is do you have someone that you can recommend as an MK lawyer MK ultra
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:37.200]  lawyer do you know what MK ultra is I don't well I'm gonna tell you after the
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  break because it's gonna take a little bit longer than the the 10 15 seconds we
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:44.320]  have here Scott we're gonna we're gonna answer that question when we come back
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:49.040]  and take a couple more calls and then that'll be end of the show and then we're

[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:18.160]  once again you can watch this on TV at info wars.com forward slash show and the
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:20.840]  reason I keep pushing that is because I was one of the people that helped put
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:25.280]  this studio together in terms of wrangling construction people and
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:29.520]  designers and light it's a gorgeous studio I'm gonna tell you I'm in love
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:34.400]  with this studio I really do like it we've had I love the shiny floor it is a
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:39.920]  pain to clean every once in a while but we do it and it looks great and to me it
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:45.440]  helps enhance the image of what we're you know putting out against our our
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:49.160]  information more credibility absolutely so absolutely and having lawyers on
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:53.000]  sometimes helps I have a love-hate relationship of lawyers although I do
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.840]  love my old lawyer Stuart Rhodes who helped me out and I got arrested for in
[02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:04.240]  2009 at the G20 in Pittsburgh so Scott you were asking about MK ultra and that
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:08.240]  was the that was the mind control program run by the CIA where they would
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.160]  use LSD to dose people up to make them more suggestible and then get them to
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:18.320]  control their actions there's people take his NC was in the MK ultra program
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:22.240]  even wrote that in his manifesto some people think the shooter in Colorado the
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:25.800]  Batman shooter was also involved in this because he was in some weird mind
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:30.840]  control stuff too in his college but so Scott was asking if you could recommend
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:35.600]  a lawyer for these types of cases Scott I cannot recommend a lawyer for those
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.200]  types of cases but I'm certain lawyers are out there that do them I would just
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  Google MK ultra lawyer but I do not focus on that type the big thing is being
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:48.160]  able to show damage right at the end of the day you have to be able to show you
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:53.440]  you've been damaged some way and have some sort of proof of that right and you
[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:58.880]  know that is hard right and I also say this I can't overstate this point the
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:04.600]  hardest thing to do in the legal system in my opinion is suing the government
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:08.440]  yeah when you look at the hurdles that you have to deal or defend yourself from
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:11.840]  the government right that's coming up to you it's absolute you're dealing with
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:16.000]  an entity with unlimited money with unlimited resources and this is what
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:21.280]  the public often doesn't realize the way they write the laws completely favor
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.000]  the government now and because the government writes the laws so the
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:28.880]  government is not going to make it easy for you to sue the government right and
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:32.680]  that is a fundamental fact that I often have to explain to people and explain to
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:36.280]  my clients that it's difficult it's challenging and so a case like that
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:39.480]  would be extra challenging because you'd be up against the federal government
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:43.360]  right dealing with classified information and they could hide behind that
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:47.400]  very easily very easily yeah always do it let's go to Chris and Florida Chris go
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:55.360]  ahead well counselor are you do handle my first question do you handle civil
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:03.320]  rights cases yes great and maybe I missed this but did you mention is it
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:08.560]  different the first question I have is is it difficult for a attorney to be a
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:13.560]  civil rights attorney not because are afraid of going in front of the judges
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:19.320]  and losing their you know they're they're basically being muted by by the
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:24.760]  same judge in the same jurisdiction there are certain jurisdictions where I
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:29.360]  think that's true I think here in Austin Texas that's not true I've never
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:33.800]  experienced that I think the most judges realize that we have civil rights for a
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:38.520]  reason and they properly adjudicate the cases and truthfully the judges don't
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:41.880]  need to make it extra hard than it already is it's already difficult because
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:45.600]  the way the laws are written and so I haven't personally experienced that I
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:49.440]  have had colleagues that I have talked to that have experienced that though in
[02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:52.640]  other cities and if you want to get in contact with Adam you can reach him

[02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:56.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:01.400 --> 03:00:07.200]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:14.920]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network my guest attorney Adam
[03:00:14.920 --> 03:00:19.040]  lowe was just asking me you have secret service come here and they've been here
[03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:24.320]  I think at least once maybe twice Texas Rangers have been here FBI usually
[03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:29.040]  because of some you know jerk puts a weird comment about killing police on
[03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:33.800]  our message board and you know they want the information on it a couple times
[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:36.840]  they've come here I think it was the Texas Rangers and David Knight takes
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:42.160]  on his camera and he starts filming the guys because please don't film me sir and
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:48.960]  David goes I hear you just kept filming him you know that's what that's the one
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:53.920]  thing I think if you can give any advice to me it's have a camera ready at all
[03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:59.280]  times and anytime you deal with authorities film it well I think that
[03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:03.800]  the filming of police officers is a game changer and I think that I've seen
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:07.760]  this in ten years of doing this kind of law is that ten years ago there never
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:11.920]  was going to be a film and now there is and so I think that at the end of the
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:17.600]  day it's healthy for the democracy for transparency the chief in Austin Texas
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:20.880]  always talks about that it's healthy for transparency yeah whether he believes
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:24.480]  it or not is in for debate but I think that the cameras are a very big issue
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.040]  and I think that it is in the long-term a good thing that more of these things
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:32.760]  are being filmed perfect hey John Mike and Sherry you guys are each gonna have
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:37.240]  one quick question John I'm going to you first what's your question well
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:42.640]  actually I have a I have a statement in a brief account because I've had I've
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:48.160]  had several bad incidents right there in Texas with DPS hitchhiking to spend
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:52.400]  spring break with a girl I met at college right there in Austin I was I was
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:57.000]  coming to Austin from the University of Alabama a DPS officer picks me up on the
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:02.200]  interstate and it had been a cold windy day or cool windy day but very sunny I
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:06.200]  was windbeat tired I asked him if he minded if I went to sleep for a few
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:10.440]  minutes or took a nap he said just fine I wake up the car is bolting around I
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:15.120]  look around we're in the desert he pulled I look over at him to and ask him
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:19.920]  where where are we and he's got a gun pointed at me he gets me out of the car
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:23.600]  out in the desert I don't know where I am and pistol whipped me and left me in the
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:27.760]  desert with two concussions and it was about four o'clock in the afternoon when
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:31.840]  I finally came to and woke up he's gone and I had to end up spending my spring
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:37.160]  break in the hospital in Austin with two concussions I don't have a whole lot of
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:43.200]  sympathy for these police they randomly pick us out brutalize us for no apparent
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:48.440]  reason and then when somebody does the same thing to you to them it's all of a
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:52.040]  sudden a national problem and a national issue quite frankly they're
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:57.000]  reaping the whirlwind they're so it see a reaping the seeds that they sowed this
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.640]  is that I don't buy this at all and if there were good cops they would rein
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:05.280]  in the bad cops and refuse to work with them and I'm sorry but that's my
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:09.240]  position I don't have any sympathy for them all right John you kind of echo
[03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:13.920]  the sentiments of Samuel earlier and you know I think there is a little bit of
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:17.200]  the chickens coming home to roost the cops have been able to hide behind the
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:22.120]  blue line for so long the bad ones and it's finally it's finally coming out
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:27.960]  Mike are we going to Mike Sherry Sherry go ahead what is your question what I'm
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:31.880]  curious about if he could speak to the difference between an attorney and a
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:36.240]  lawyer because when you look up a lawyer in the phone book it says see
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:40.800]  attorneys so there must be a difference between the two and what is their
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:48.480]  allegiance is it to the court or to their client and and let them answer
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:51.440]  those two first go with us what's the difference between attorney and a lawyer
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:55.560]  that's a good that's a that's a that's a century-old riddle then it's very
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:59.520]  difficult to answer I don't know the answer to that question I think that
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:03.040]  it's semantics I think it's the same thing so I'm not really quite sure how
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:07.760]  to answer where is your allegiance lie lawyer so that also is a very interesting
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:12.680]  question ethically my allegiance lies to my client my duties to my client but
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:15.640]  I'm also an officer of the court so you have to respect the laws respect the
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:20.160]  court there has been millions of pages written about various examples and
[03:04:20.160 --> 03:04:23.640]  hypotheticals in which there's contradictory allegiances and that's why
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:27.640]  we have that hundreds of law school and law school professors that debate that
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:30.800]  all day all right Mike and Sherry I'm sorry I'm gonna jump Mike go ahead real
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:36.600]  quickly what's your question hey Mike Parsons.org is the website so you can
[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:40.800]  read the narrative because we can't cover it now but basically just average Joe
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:45.280]  got fed up with the corruption ran for office one they split to vote still the
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:50.160]  election so I sued then I'm reloaded into jail when a man that's partners with
[03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:54.120]  the guy I was suing attacked me and shot at us and killed our dog in front of us.
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:57.640]  Mike send me an email on that it sounds interesting we'll be back with
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:05:02.600]  overdrive robdueinfoors.com. A humanitarian crisis of a magnitude not seen

[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:15.520]  to pick issue with you anti-vaxxers, right wingers, rednecks. It's about big
[03:08:15.520 --> 03:08:19.440]  brother but on the other hand some things do require some involvement of big

[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:45.560]  want to tell anybody out there if you get a shot you're a fool. Meanwhile the
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:51.960]  insert says it can make you get measles. We have to break through our kind of
[03:08:51.960 --> 03:08:56.000]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.960]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities. But I think the parents
[03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:03.280]  should have some input the state doesn't own your children parents own the
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:07.520]  children and it is an issue of freedom. But the 10% can't go to school unless you
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:13.200]  get vaccinated. The science of vaccines which work effectively 100% of the time and
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:17.320]  the widespread. Oh wait a minute I'm sorry you haven't read the CDC memo have you?
[03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:21.760]  It was 99% last week now they're telling people it's 97% so it's not a
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:25.280]  hundred percent even by their own statistics. Meanwhile the outbreak was
[03:09:25.280 --> 03:09:35.280]  caused by vaccinated people. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:09:35.280 --> 03:09:40.040]  That's right and we are now in Overdrive. This is Rob Dew hosting the Alex Jones
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:43.480]  show the Overdrive Hour. We're out in Chicago. We've got Liam McAdoo, Jakari
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:48.160]  Jackson. I want to thank our guest Adam Lowy. You can check him out at loyferm.com.
[03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:54.440]  L-O-E-W-I-F-I-R-M.com and appreciate all the callers calling in with their
[03:09:54.440 --> 03:09:59.520]  questions. Now you know since we just had the vaccine intro and I do a lot of
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:04.160]  vaccine research. You know I don't know if you can call me a doctor but I do a lot
[03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:09.640]  of vaccine research. And yesterday I was floored by this video that was sent to me.
[03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:15.960]  It was a link to a Facebook page. It was sent to me via Twitter and it was I
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:19.000]  quickly shot a version of it because I couldn't figure out how to get the video
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:23.160]  off Facebook so I just shot it with my camera on my phone, talked about it,
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:26.880]  immediately put it up. I don't know how many hits it has now. It had 26,000 this
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:31.560]  morning which is 26,000 more people that are awake to the fact that these
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:36.360]  vaccines cause damage. And these are young girls. Go ahead and roll that
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:41.720]  video. The young girls convulsing on the floor after HPV shot. And I'm going to
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:46.640]  read to you guys the translation. There's a Facebook post. You can see the
[03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:54.040]  you guys are actually playing my, I actually put actual video from the
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:57.560]  Facebook page. I actually screenshotted that. So that's what I want you all to
[03:10:57.560 --> 03:11:04.100]  bring up. And not the special report because it's actually clearer. It's the
[03:11:04.100 --> 03:11:08.400]  actual video. So we'll see if you all can come in. And as we talk about these vaccines
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:12.720]  do, I know we've seen the stuff down in Mexico also places like Syria. And people
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:16.760]  say, well, if it's that serious, if it can potentially harm you, why don't you
[03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:19.120]  hear about it on the news? Because they don't want you to hear about it on the
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:22.520]  news. They don't want you to know about the World Health Organization going
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:25.800]  to giving these vaccinations to the Syrian kids. And then they die. And then you
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:30.160]  have the situations in Mexico and other places. And then Washington on TV,
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:34.240]  Washington on TV, when they put the young lady on Katie Kirk show, and she's
[03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:37.520]  saying, hey, I took the vaccine. I was sick for a year. And then they have a
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:40.480]  lady sitting next to like, well, these side effects are very mild and they
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:43.400]  don't happen to most people. Meanwhile, the girls, you know, spent thousands of
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:47.440]  dollars at the doctor. It has all these health defects from the vaccines, but they
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:51.280]  don't ever want to talk about that. And this Gardasil shot is what's bad. That's
[03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:54.760]  actually, there should be two videos that look like that. I want the one with all
[03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:58.400]  the kids on the floor. There you go, guys. Play that one. That's the one that is
[03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:02.520]  really shocking. There's, and turn the audio down because this guy talks really
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:07.800]  loud. But you could just see, and people were telling me that this was fake
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:11.160]  because some of these, they, it looks like they recruited young boys here to
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:14.480]  help hold the girls down while they're convulsing because you could really hurt
[03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:18.280]  yourself. You could break your neck, pushing yourself back into a wall or
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:21.720]  something. It's a couple of these kids smile, but this is because this is not
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:24.880]  something they see all the time. If this is something they saw all the time, they
[03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:29.480]  would probably be, you know, a little more freaked out. But this looks like an
[03:12:29.480 --> 03:12:32.560]  occurrence. You know, these kids at least haven't seen this. There's a doctor in
[03:12:32.560 --> 03:12:35.480]  there. There's several adults in there. There's no way this is fake, first of all.
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:40.800]  I mean, these poor girls have all been given the Gardasil shot. And now, or
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:46.000]  either that, or either the Gardasil or the cervix, cervix is what they call it,
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:52.680]  is the other HPV vaccine. But you can really, I mean, it's, this is the damage
[03:12:52.680 --> 03:12:56.040]  that is going on in their brains right now. This is their body reacting to their
[03:12:56.040 --> 03:12:59.160]  brains being damaged. And that's what you're saying. You'll hear people say,
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:03.520]  oh, well, this, this reaction, it's subsides after a little bit. You know,
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:07.080]  they're just convulsed for a little bit. Don't worry. Hopefully they'll be fine.
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:10.440]  Hopefully they're fine. And then just the dovetail and what Leanne said, they said,
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:14.480]  well, this type of reaction is normal. It may be normal, but is that healthy? Yeah.
[03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:18.120]  What is normal about that? Well, first of all, that's not normal. Watch this girl.
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:20.680]  She's going to slam her head back here in a second. The girl that's sitting up,
[03:13:20.680 --> 03:13:24.600]  she's going to go through another round of seizures. And these are febrile
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:28.120]  seizures as well. And this is a documented side effect of this vaccine.
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:31.880]  Right. So she's recovering right now. Bam, slams her head back. That is not
[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:37.600]  acting. That is, it, it sickens me that this is, that this type of video is out
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:40.400]  here and this is what our government is man trying to mandate that people take.
[03:13:40.400 --> 03:13:45.560]  Mandate. They're trying to mandate HPV vaccines. Governor Perry tried to make all
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:49.040]  girls get it. And there was a huge outcry. I tried to say that was a law and he
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:54.960]  lied. And you have some women here are suing the makers now because they had
[03:13:54.960 --> 03:14:01.160]  their pre-menopausal, you know, old, they can never have kids. And,
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:04.120]  and, and that's what they're, these are designed to do. This is designed to be
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:08.480]  population control. These girls are at Carmen de Boulevard district. That's what
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:14.080]  I did a translation of what it says. And this guy's saying the population is
[03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:18.680]  completely neglected by the health system. There's anguish that exists in the
[03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:21.960]  population. How can this keep happening? Do you not understand how the interest is
[03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:24.760]  clearly not the protection of underage girls? It's violating the right of
[03:14:24.760 --> 03:14:29.000]  healthy. Where is the international human rights UNICEF? Because all these
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:33.440]  people are in on it. That's why you don't see that. And then at the end, no more
[03:14:33.440 --> 03:14:37.440]  Russian roulette. These images are real and speak for themselves. No human
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:44.720]  papillomavirus. So no shots. He has a little icon, emoji of a shot. No
[03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:48.560]  shots for the human papillomavirus. Right. Now this other video, it was right
[03:14:48.560 --> 03:14:51.200]  underneath it on the Facebook post. And I put a link to the Facebook post there.
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:54.080]  You can go check it out yourself. I mean, I put the links right there. It's all
[03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:57.320]  sourced. If you scroll down a little bit more, go to that other video. And this is
[03:14:57.320 --> 03:15:00.600]  a girl in a hospital bed who's having a seizure. So her parents were obviously so
[03:15:00.600 --> 03:15:05.200]  concerned they brought her to the hospital at some point. And you guys
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:08.480]  actually have that video. Y'all can, y'all had it up right before that. It's the
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:12.440]  girl in the hospital bed. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, she's doing the same thing. And
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:17.480]  then she's going to stop and her body is in recovery. This is like, if you've
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:21.480]  ever seen someone give birth, they're going through contractions. The body's
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:24.240]  going up and down. And then it goes up and has the seizures again, then comes
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:29.240]  back down to a little bit of rest. But I mean, this is what these drugs or these
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:33.640]  vaccines are doing to people. And it's disgusting. It's not a necessary vaccine.
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:37.240]  I mean, yes, I know, obviously you want to protect young girls from potentially
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:42.680]  getting cervical cancer. But just like we've seen a rise in breast cancer after
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:47.640]  so many women are on birth control, it has the adverse effect. In most people,
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:52.840]  HPV clears itself from the system after about two years. As long as you have a
[03:15:52.840 --> 03:15:58.520]  healthy immune system, it's one of the most common STDs that's out there. And
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:16:02.440]  it's not necessarily sexually transmitted. You can get it from sitting on a
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:07.880]  bench at the gym and someone has a sweat on the bench at the gym. So that's
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:11.320]  why it's so common. It's so prevalent and a lot of people don't even know they
[03:16:11.320 --> 03:16:15.440]  have it. But they put out the myth that everybody's giving it to everybody and
[03:16:15.440 --> 03:16:19.360]  it causes cancer and we could help eliminate cancer. And it's just a big,
[03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:23.640]  it's a big BS story to get more people to get injected with vaccines so they
[03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:26.400]  can make more money. And now they're creating patients right there. Look at
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:30.200]  all the patients they're going to have. Oh, well, now you have narcolepsy.
[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:34.440]  You got something to treat you for that. It actually makes you more
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:38.880]  susceptible to other strains of HPV. If you go and get this Gardasil, yeah, it
[03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:42.760]  might protect you from this one strain, but there's like 17 different strains of
[03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:48.560]  HPV. So in your actually more likely to catch one of those other strains, because
[03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:52.400]  your body, the defense is, you know, just like it is when you get a vaccine from,
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:58.080]  you know, chicken pox or just like if you can go to Walgreens CVS and get an
[03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:01.600]  insert. We have several in the back right now where you can get the flu vaccine
[03:17:01.600 --> 03:17:05.960]  insert and it says on the insert that this can potentially give you nausea,
[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:09.800]  headache, diarrhea, but it sounds just as bad if not worse than the flu that you
[03:17:09.800 --> 03:17:14.440]  would have got anyway. You know, and in people, it's like this disparity.
[03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:17.200]  People can't understand that like, yeah, you can get it from the shop, but I have
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:20.320]  to go, have to go get it. And what's wrong with you? I want my herd immunity. I'm
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:23.360]  like, bro, you can, you can get a, the flu from that shot you're taking right now.
[03:17:23.360 --> 03:17:27.920]  Right. Herd immunity is a myth and people should, there's plenty of videos out
[03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:30.240]  there of people who used to work for these drug companies who come out and
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:33.680]  said, look, I even did the own research because when I had kids, I wanted to make
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:36.640]  sure there's one guy who, who did it in the 90s before the internet was around.
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:40.640]  And he was looking at stories. The ant, the, the stuff he found that vaccines
[03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:43.560]  were damaging was about this tall at the stack. And he said the stuff that said
[03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:47.040]  they were fine was about this tall. And that was in the 90s when people really
[03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:50.720]  weren't, you know, weren't able to get this information out as widespread as we
[03:17:50.720 --> 03:17:55.440]  can now. And that's the great thing. Like, you know, I saw this on Twitter late last
[03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:58.880]  night. I was about to leave. It's like 715. I said, you know, I got to shoot a
[03:17:58.880 --> 03:18:03.920]  video on this. This is so disturbing. It really, it makes me angry that this is
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:08.240]  going on in our world and it's being done by people who claim that they have
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:11.120]  your best interests in heart and they don't, they do not have your best
[03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:14.480]  interests in heart. Their, their interests lie elsewhere and in other
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:20.160]  realms. Yeah. It's definitely not on earth. So, um, you know, now we've gone
[03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:22.560]  through that. We're actually going to cover that again tonight on the infowars
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:25.280]  nightly news. I'm going to come in with Darren and I'm going to look, I'll look
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:29.200]  up some more stuff. I want to see about what is causing these, um,
[03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:32.720]  febrile seizures, like what is actually going on in the brain and why that
[03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:36.160]  happens. Because that is where the damage is being done. It's being done in the
[03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:38.800]  brain and that your body's just reacting to it right there.
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:42.240]  You're damaging. Obviously you're doing nerve damage and you're having seizures
[03:18:42.240 --> 03:18:45.840]  like that. And later at the second half of the hour, I want to take some calls
[03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:48.960]  at the bottom of the hour. So we, I guess we can go ahead and start loading up
[03:18:48.960 --> 03:18:56.160]  the phone lines again, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. On any topic, uh, you want
[03:18:56.160 --> 03:18:58.400]  to bring up unless you guys have anything specific, you want to,
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:00.960]  Oh no, just whatever they got. All right. And, and what do you want to talk
[03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:05.200]  about next, uh, in our next segment? Well, I saw something on the top of
[03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:09.440]  drugs. This may not be a whole segment, but I saw the headline for the Kentucky
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:13.520]  Clerk that was jailed for refusing the, uh, the gay marriage licenses. And I
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:17.200]  thought that was kind of interesting that they would jail her instead of firing
[03:19:17.200 --> 03:19:20.720]  her. You know, if it came down to it, if it was, you know, that big of a deal,
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:23.440]  you know, why would they fire her instead of her putting her in jail? But,
[03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:28.320]  Uh, it's very odd in my opinion. Oh, so she's a government employee.
[03:19:28.320 --> 03:19:32.960]  She might even get fired. And that's in Kentucky. Yeah. You know, forcing people
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:36.720]  to do things they don't want to do. That's what, you know, that's what you're
[03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:38.960]  going to get when you try to force people to do something they don't want to do.
[03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:44.080]  And it's going to end up worse as this PC culture ramps up and we're living in

[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:34.240]  So I found out the other day that at guns 80.com, a lot of people don't get the
[03:20:34.240 --> 03:20:38.800]  ghost AR 15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the
[03:20:38.800 --> 03:20:43.840]  machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower. Well, listen, guys,
[03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:48.080]  gals, I am not that good of a machine as I promise you, but I was able to take a

[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:27.760]  All right, we are in the midst of the overdrive hour of the Alex Jones show. I'm your host Rob
[03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:35.440]  Dew, Brian Chagun, Liam McAdoo, Jakari Jackson. You can watch this live at enforce.com forward slash
[03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:39.040]  show. I think that's amazing that we have the technology to just shoot it out over the internet.
[03:24:40.640 --> 03:24:44.720]  The middle of the month though, we're going to be launching into space, right? We got the
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:52.000]  Money Bomb September 16th and 17th. We're going to start at 11 a.m. on the September 16th. Go
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:57.200]  overnight and then finish up at the end of the show, which will now be not 2 p.m., like we
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:07.680]  normally do. It'll be 3 p.m. on the 17th, so 28 hours of live, live, power-packed radio. I forget
[03:25:07.680 --> 03:25:11.920]  how many Money Bombs this will be for me, but we haven't done one in a couple years, so I'm really
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:18.160]  excited to get on the air and just, especially in those later hours, it's commercial free.
[03:25:18.160 --> 03:25:21.600]  So we're just going to go. There's not going to be any stoppage of breaks. The only time we're
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:27.760]  going to get a stop is when we play a video report or something. So join us September 16th and 17th.
[03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:32.960]  Go to infowars.com forward slash Money Bomb to learn all the information about what we're doing,
[03:25:32.960 --> 03:25:37.040]  why we're having a Money Bomb, because we haven't had one in a couple years. And we're doing this
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:42.640]  to get infowars on satellites to shoot it over to networks all over North America.
[03:25:42.640 --> 03:25:47.760]  And if you look at the distribution of channels, there's about 2,500 independent
[03:25:47.760 --> 03:25:54.960]  stations in the United States. You've got about 15, 1700 in Mexico, a few hundred up in Canada.
[03:25:54.960 --> 03:25:59.680]  All of those can potentially be reached with the satellite stream that we're going to be sending
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:04.560]  out. Right now, we're going to start at five hours a day, four hours for the Alex Jones show,
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:09.200]  and then one hour of the nightly news. And we're going to let, we're putting it out. It's called
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:14.640]  Free to Air. We're just going to put it out there and let people grab it and put their
[03:26:14.640 --> 03:26:20.560]  commercials in at the designated spots. And so it's a great way to spread the message,
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:25.280]  to wake people up, and to get rid of this left right paradigm mentality that people have been,
[03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:30.720]  you know, spellbound under for so long. So I'm looking forward to it. And I think,
[03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:34.640]  Jakar, you're going to be talking about during the nightly news, you're posting the news. But what's
[03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:38.720]  interesting is that night is the debate. So we're going to do that mystery science theater 3000,
[03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:44.560]  basically talk over the goons while they're trying to tell us why we need to elect one of them
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:51.280]  to the highest office in the land. Getting back to that, finishing up on the vaccines.
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:59.360]  Here's a story. China finds GlaxoSmithKline nearly 500 million for bribery. And if you're
[03:26:59.360 --> 03:27:02.960]  the UK company who's on guilty of offering bribes to boost its business, then we'll have to pay the
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:10.160]  fine to the Chinese government, a 3 billion yuan, which is 489 million. So, but what do they make
[03:27:10.160 --> 03:27:16.080]  per year? Don't we have that link up as well? How many billions do they make per year?
[03:27:16.080 --> 03:27:21.440]  It's like three points something. Yeah. So this is a, this is a drop in the bucket for these guys.
[03:27:21.440 --> 03:27:28.800]  This is probably, yeah, 3.4 billion. Geez. Yeah, that's not going to hurt them too much at all. And
[03:27:28.800 --> 03:27:32.960]  this had to do, this didn't even have to, they were just raising prices on people. No, that's what
[03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:39.200]  this is all about. I think that billion was just in the fourth quarter. Right? Oh yeah, there it is.
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:45.520]  It went up in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Oh, wow. Wow. Wow, sir. That looks like
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:52.560]  pounds too. Find out their revenue for the year 2014. I didn't think it's probably in the realm of
[03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:57.440]  12 billion. Yeah, I didn't think 3.4 billion worldwide. And you know, that's what they want to
[03:27:57.440 --> 03:28:02.000]  do. That's their end goal is to make more money. So that's why they go out and fund politician
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:08.880]  campaigns. They fund ads. They fund studies that aren't true to prove that vaccines are safe and
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:13.520]  effective. Then they try to force them down everybody's throat. And then they run this PSYOP
[03:28:13.520 --> 03:28:17.600]  campaign of making people who don't want to vaccinate their kids seem like they're crazy
[03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:21.920]  because they actually read the insert. Right. Yeah. And they don't want to teach you about
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:27.280]  proper nutrition and proper pH balance. What was that?
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:34.400]  23.1 billion. Yeah, there you go. I was wrong. I said 12 billion.
[03:28:36.320 --> 03:28:39.200]  Pretty big. That's a drop in the bucket. It's always going to be more than you can even see.
[03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:42.800]  That's the cost of doing business for GSK. And they're like, you know, when we get caught,
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:45.760]  we'll pay them off. That's what the banks do. And they get caught laundering drug money.
[03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:49.840]  You know, they launder billions. They pay several hundred million. Yeah. It's as if they
[03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:53.600]  got a slap on the wrist for two days worth of business. Hey, you robbed that bank
[03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:59.920]  for $50,000. You're going to have to pay a fine of 3000. It sounds worth it to me. Yeah.
[03:29:00.800 --> 03:29:06.560]  So, hey, next segment, we're going to be taking your phone calls 800-259-9231. We have CJ in
[03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:11.680]  Michigan, Denise, Dion, Gerald, Patricia. We will be going to all your calls. Looks like some
[03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:17.520]  people want to talk about vaccinations, which is good. We got a CPS call in there. Gerald also
[03:29:17.520 --> 03:29:22.160]  has something about lawyer versus attorney. Maybe he found out what the difference is between a
[03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:29.600]  lawyer and an attorney is. They both suck blood. Yes. But Adam was one of the good guys. So,
[03:29:29.600 --> 03:29:33.120]  it was great to have a good, we do need more good guy attorneys in here. We need more that are going
[03:29:33.120 --> 03:29:37.600]  to fight on the side of good and not for the side of evil. It's Rob Do, Leigh Ann McAdoo,
[03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:48.720]  Jakari Jackson, infowars.com, overdrive hour. It's the Alex Jones show, and you can catch it infowars.com, forward slash show.
[03:29:48.720 --> 03:30:18.640]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Kill whites and cops. Black Lives Matter affiliated radio show calls for a race war. In a disgusting audio broadcast via blog talk radio yesterday, an individual who admitted affiliation with the Black Lives Matter movement called for listeners to murder white people
[03:30:18.640 --> 03:30:39.600]  and police declaring it open season for executions. Open season on killing whites and white police officers. And I want to talk about the shooting of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas. It's open season on killing whites and white police officers and probably killing cops period. It's open season picking them off.
[03:30:39.600 --> 03:30:51.120]  Today we live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's nothing he can do about it. His day is up. His time is up. We will witness more executions and killing of white people and cops than we ever have before.
[03:30:51.120 --> 03:31:16.080]  For updates on this story and breaking news as it happens, go to infowars.com.

[03:33:08.720 --> 03:33:37.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:38.720 --> 03:33:58.720]  We're at the bottom of the hour of the Overdrive Hour for the Alex Jones show. We're going to be doing this regularly now, so hope you enjoy it. One more hour to cover the stories that Alex couldn't cover. Play some of the videos he didn't get to play.
[03:33:58.720 --> 03:34:11.720]  Today he took off an hour early and was feeling low blood sugar. I think the weight of everything that's going on in his personal mission is just getting weighed down.
[03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:12.720]  It's heavy.
[03:34:12.720 --> 03:34:30.720]  Yeah, it is. It's a lot of horrible information. We just showed you some of the shocking video of those girls on the floor convulsing after getting the HPV shot. Over on Infowars, take a look over here. Trump says U.S. would have to defend Iran against Israel attack.
[03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:49.720]  It's from Kurt Nemo. Sites terms of nuclear agreement. Special report. This is from Joe Biggs. He just filed this this morning. Hoax since police on Wild Goose Chase in Fox Lake, Manhunt. If you were on our Ustream channel last night, you could watch the adventures of Joe Biggs on the police scanner following the cops around.
[03:34:49.720 --> 03:34:53.720]  He even, he got so fed up that they weren't going and looking for these guys. He started looking for them.
[03:34:53.720 --> 03:35:05.720]  Yeah, he went through a cornfield and got freaked out. You could watch it all on Alex Jones live on our Ustream channel and we're going to be putting some of that footage over his report and playing it tonight on the nightly news.
[03:35:05.720 --> 03:35:19.720]  Also, report Trump to sign GOP pledge precluding a third party run. You know, this could hurt him in some ways because if he does sign this, then they can easily just dismiss him and then he has no recourse to come back and say, well, I'm not a third party.
[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:23.720]  Well, that's when they think they're really going to start exposing all of his bad things.
[03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:31.720]  And if he does run third party, then we have Queen Hillary. So it doesn't look good for the American people are screwed either way.
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:40.720]  Refugees from US, Saudi sponsored Syria and war flood into Europe. This is truly becoming almost biblical with the amount of people they're picking up.
[03:35:40.720 --> 03:35:50.720]  There was a horrible picture on Drudge yesterday of the Williams Drown. Yeah, you know, those images are designed to pull on your heartstrings and say, invite the whole world into your country.
[03:35:50.720 --> 03:35:54.720]  Don't fix their problems. But you know what? We caused a lot of the problems.
[03:35:54.720 --> 03:36:01.720]  Oh, absolutely. They're even coming here now. I saw they were coming to Dallas is someone of a hub for the people from Syria.
[03:36:01.720 --> 03:36:08.720]  And I definitely understand they want to get out there. But as you're pointing out, you know, Obama gets out there and he says they crossed a red line referring to Assad.
[03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:16.720]  They say, well, I didn't say that somebody else said that. And then at least in one of the videos of the chemical attacks, it has the al-Qaeda al-Qaeda watermark on the video.
[03:36:16.720 --> 03:36:21.720]  They think we're that dumb. Exactly. And they do. They do think we're that dumb. They don't think we don't pay attention.
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:35.720]  They do think we don't have, we have an army of intelligence officers and it's the American people and citizens worldwide who don't want to come to the tyranny, who call in with their tips, who shoot video, who make it a point to point out the hypocrisy.
[03:36:35.720 --> 03:36:44.720]  Let's see. Neutron bomb used in Yemen. Question mark. That's a John Bound report. This is one that I filed last night. Shocking young girls can fall on the floor after HPV shot.
[03:36:44.720 --> 03:36:53.720]  Rise of the Inhumans. And Dave Stockman is taking a very not Lego movie look on the economy. He's saying the economy is not awesome. So everything is not awesome.
[03:36:53.720 --> 03:36:54.720]  Everything's not awesome.
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:37:02.720]  Yeah. I'm sorry to tell you, but the economy is not doing too well. So, but Leanne, you brought this article in from Science News. Very creepy article.
[03:37:02.720 --> 03:37:09.720]  I like right here. Ask not what your gadgets can do for you. Ask what you can do for your gadgets.
[03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:16.720]  So what is this about these nanogenerators? They want to implant into your body to power your wearables.
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:23.720]  Yes. Well, they're implantable. But I guess in these first stages, they're just going to be kind of stuck on you like a Band-Aid or something like that.
[03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:41.720]  They're nanogenerators. They're going to harvest the body's energy to power your devices. And I mean, this is, it just makes me think of the matrix in this scene where all the humans are actually in these pods and the aliens are like harvesting their energy.
[03:37:41.720 --> 03:37:55.720]  I mean, we are these energy conductors and here they're already working on ways that we can, through our moving our arms around or even breathing, it's harvesting that energy. And so now you won't have to plug in your devices anymore.
[03:37:55.720 --> 03:38:03.720]  The things we do for convenience, can I remember that office? I think David did the report about it where they had people have chips to use the copy machine.
[03:38:03.720 --> 03:38:08.720]  You can walk up to the, I can walk up to the copy machine right now and use it without that chip in my head.
[03:38:08.720 --> 03:38:17.720]  Well, some companies, not this one though, let me tell you, Info Wars definitely prints a lot of paper, but in some companies, they actually have quotas at what you can print.
[03:38:17.720 --> 03:38:23.720]  So you would have to put in a card and it would measure how many copies you made. And if you went over your limit, then they would take it out of your pay.
[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:36.720]  So that is why you see that in some areas, not that I'm condoning the use of chips for copy machines, but that's how crazy it's become and how like penny pinching some of these companies are just like, well, we can only have 12 copies of this.
[03:38:36.720 --> 03:38:42.720]  And that's it. And we don't do that here. We definitely unfortunately kill a lot of trees.
[03:38:42.720 --> 03:38:49.720]  But it really does it. You do see, you know, just laying out the articles before you can see all all the madness that's going on.
[03:38:49.720 --> 03:38:54.720]  Let's go to a caller CJ Michigan in Michigan. What's on your mind?
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:03.720]  How's it going, man? Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll touch on this because I saw you guys talking about earlier the vaccine video where all the girls are convulsing on the floor.
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:12.720]  I actually had a friend over last night who happens to speak Spanish and he was I asked him to translate from he's kind of out of the loop a little bit.
[03:39:12.720 --> 03:39:22.720]  So I was trying to have him watch some stuff and he was I was like, can you translate that for me? And he was like, yeah, they're pretty much saying, you know, it's a big problem in the country.
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:32.720]  And it doesn't even tell me that, you know, they know that the shots are causing it or any of that, you know, they like and so they just have girls convulsing on the floor.
[03:39:32.720 --> 03:39:37.720]  But they don't they're not putting two and two together. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[03:39:37.720 --> 03:39:47.720]  And they're like asking like they're pretty much asking for help on the video, you know, like, does anybody know what's causing this, you know, they're pretty much.
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:53.720]  Yeah, the doctor said it's safe and effective. Young girls fall down all the time and start convulsing on the floor.
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:39:57.720]  It's called beetle mania. Well, they're going to tell them they're possessed or something. Yeah.
[03:39:57.720 --> 03:40:03.720]  You know, that's some I think one of the comments somebody did say that it looked like it was an exorcism or something like that.
[03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:09.720]  Right. And that's what they'll tell them if they don't, they might. And if you're in, you know, if you're not educated enough to go, no, wait a minute, I just took a shot.
[03:40:09.720 --> 03:40:16.720]  Right. You know, there's there's people in in these African villages, they're chasing off the health care workers because they're like, no, we don't want your damn shots.
[03:40:16.720 --> 03:40:22.720]  We don't want your we don't even need to read the answer. We know they're bad. Right. You know, and so kudos to them.
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:29.720]  Thanks for calling CJ Denise in Texas. You're in our state here. What's going on in Texas?
[03:40:29.720 --> 03:40:35.720]  Hey, I just wanted to tie in everything with the CPS, what was going on.
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:38.720]  Okay.
[03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:45.720]  Well, with my family, my grandson started having seizures. Okay.
[03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:53.720]  He has like a abnormal brain. It grows bigger than it's growing bigger than it should. Okay.
[03:40:53.720 --> 03:41:04.720]  A dog seems to think that, you know, it was because of a vaccine when it got, but we don't know, they're not going to tell us anything.
[03:41:04.720 --> 03:41:09.720]  But every time he had the seizure, seizure, CPS is called in.
[03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:17.720]  Really? Okay. So they call the hot, they call the hospital or the ambulance to come get him because of the seizures and then CPS shows up.
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:21.720]  The school will. Okay. Oh, somebody has him at school. Okay.
[03:41:21.720 --> 03:41:28.720]  This is, I don't know if you know anything about whether for Texas, but it is the most awful town in Texas.
[03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:36.720]  It's like the left has taken over the whole whole city. It is horrible. I went to visit my daughter. That's where she lives.
[03:41:36.720 --> 03:41:44.720]  Well, okay. Now, now CPS says, you know, they have to go with their dad. Okay.
[03:41:44.720 --> 03:41:52.720]  And they will not let me see him. The CPS lady says that she does not know me.
[03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:59.720]  I am, I have cooperated with her. I gave her my driver's license, my social security and everything.
[03:41:59.720 --> 03:42:07.720]  She told my daughter that she cannot believe that I am not a felon. Okay.
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:17.720]  I've never been in trouble. I am serious. The CPS people are right in there with what, what the rest of this country is doing.
[03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:23.720]  Oh yeah. Absolute power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. And they think they have absolute power over you.
[03:42:23.720 --> 03:42:28.720]  Right. The thing you need to do, and this is, this is what I would do. This is what I would do.
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:32.720]  Anytime you have interactions with these people, I would be recording it in some way, shape or form.
[03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:38.720]  Texas is a single party consent state. So only one party has to consent to the recording.
[03:42:38.720 --> 03:42:41.720]  So anytime you're on the phone with these people, that's what I would be doing.
[03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:45.720]  I'm not a lawyer, but you know, you got to protect yourself with dealing with CPS.
[03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:50.720]  Like you have to be on the, you, you have to assume that they're going to try and take your kids.
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:54.720]  Exactly. And they will use anything. They will come into your house and go, you have dirty dishes.
[03:42:54.720 --> 03:43:00.720]  The kids having seizures. Oh, we have to come in, you know, and it's, it's caused by these vaccines.
[03:43:00.720 --> 03:43:03.720]  And they're doing that so they could get your kids and then they get money for them.
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:10.720]  It literally is a bounty system. They get money for placing kids in foster care and that keeps more money coming into the system.
[03:43:10.720 --> 03:43:16.720]  It's disgusting. And I'm sorry you're having to deal with it right now, but that's, that certainly is very sad.
[03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:20.720]  But that is the times we live in and we have to protect ourselves and we have to speak out against it.
[03:43:20.720 --> 03:43:25.720]  I'm glad you're speaking out Denise. Dionne, Illinois. What's going on? You want to talk about mandatory vaccination?
[03:43:25.720 --> 03:43:31.720]  Yeah, there's a mandatory vaccination passed August 3rd in Illinois.
[03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:35.720]  Great six through 12 had to take the meningitis vaccine.
[03:43:35.720 --> 03:43:43.720]  There's a school in Lake Forest where 95% of the seniors have been vaccinated.
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:48.720]  I just wanted to know, you think this is going to be a trend throughout schools?
[03:43:48.720 --> 03:43:54.720]  And what do you think these people are going to go through after they take the vaccine? Thank you.
[03:43:54.720 --> 03:44:00.720]  Well, this is definitely going to be a trend that continues. California is the place where trends start in our country.
[03:44:00.720 --> 03:44:03.720]  They start out West in California and they come this way.
[03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:05.720]  And what you're going to see, I think you're going to see two things.
[03:44:05.720 --> 03:44:10.720]  You're going to see a rise in adverse reactions because these kids are going to start getting a bunch of these at once.
[03:44:10.720 --> 03:44:16.720]  And so parents need to be aware that if you are going to give your kid one of these, you better be aware of what the adverse reactions are.
[03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:19.720]  And two, you're going to see a rise in homeschooling, which I think is a positive thing.
[03:44:19.720 --> 03:44:25.720]  I think we need to see more kids in homeschooling because you're not under that oppressive system
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:30.720]  that is basically teaching you to be a cog in the wheel of a giant corporation
[03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:35.720]  instead of a free-thinking person who can solve problems with ingenuity.
[03:44:35.720 --> 03:44:40.720]  Speaking of ingenuity, there's some interesting stuff going on out in Burning Man,
[03:44:40.720 --> 03:44:47.720]  but it's not what you would normally think, it's not girls in bikinis and art, it's the FBI using spy technology.
[03:44:47.720 --> 03:44:49.720]  What's going on in Burning Man this week?
[03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:51.720]  Yeah, so the Burning Man Festival happens every year.
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:57.720]  It's been going on for about 29 years and it's basically like an free expression arts festival.
[03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:01.720]  People head out there and for a week, they don't exchange any money.
[03:45:01.720 --> 03:45:03.720]  Everything's on the barter system.
[03:45:03.720 --> 03:45:11.720]  It's all about sort of kindness and shedding your ego, shedding the old self and just, you know, living free from the state basically.
[03:45:11.720 --> 03:45:14.720]  So here we have this culture out there.
[03:45:14.720 --> 03:45:19.720]  Well, now the undercover FBI agents are spying on the Burning Man Festival.
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:27.720]  They say to prevent terrorism, but they're also testing out new intelligence collection technology.
[03:45:27.720 --> 03:45:33.720]  And of course, the document where it shows where they're kind of speaking back and forth to the law enforcement there in Nevada,
[03:45:33.720 --> 03:45:39.720]  that part's redacted so we don't know exactly what type of intelligence collection technology they're using.
[03:45:39.720 --> 03:45:47.720]  But here we have these people that are out there figuring out how to live free from the state.
[03:45:47.720 --> 03:45:49.720]  It's the barter system, free expression.
[03:45:49.720 --> 03:45:55.720]  Our government is funding terrorists all over the world, but they're doing anti-terror stuff at Burning Man.
[03:45:55.720 --> 03:45:56.720]  Right.
[03:45:56.720 --> 03:45:57.720]  It's ridiculous.
[03:45:57.720 --> 03:45:58.720]  It's a terrorist.
[03:45:58.720 --> 03:45:59.720]  I'm back.
[03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:00.720]  Hey, you feeling better?
[03:46:00.720 --> 03:46:01.720]  Yeah, I'll tell you what happened.
[03:46:01.720 --> 03:46:02.720]  I'm not complaining.
[03:46:02.720 --> 03:46:03.720]  They got me breakfast tacos and I didn't like them.
[03:46:03.720 --> 03:46:04.720]  Yeah.
[03:46:04.720 --> 03:46:05.720]  So I didn't eat.
[03:46:05.720 --> 03:46:08.720]  And then when I don't eat, it uses all the sugar up in my brain.
[03:46:08.720 --> 03:46:09.720]  Exactly.
[03:46:09.720 --> 03:46:10.720]  I'm mildly hypoglycemic.
[03:46:10.720 --> 03:46:12.720]  I don't have a serious case of it.
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:13.720]  And you exercised this morning.
[03:46:13.720 --> 03:46:15.720]  And I exercised super hard.
[03:46:15.720 --> 03:46:17.720]  I climbed a mountain, pretty much.
[03:46:17.720 --> 03:46:19.720]  I'm, you know, hiked up one today.
[03:46:19.720 --> 03:46:24.720]  And I mean, but we calculated it was like 34 minutes straight up, never stopping.
[03:46:24.720 --> 03:46:25.720]  Yeah.
[03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:26.720]  It was like a deal.
[03:46:26.720 --> 03:46:27.720]  The point is, is that I didn't eat.
[03:46:27.720 --> 03:46:28.720]  I've been up since 6am.
[03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:32.720]  And then I just get super doomy and gloomy and it's like torture being on air.
[03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:35.720]  And then you're reading all this doom and gloom and it's not making it any easier.
[03:46:35.720 --> 03:46:36.720]  Yes.
[03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:38.720]  But I'm not pouty when I'm not here tomorrow.
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:39.720]  I'll be honest.
[03:46:39.720 --> 03:46:42.720]  I think I have sleep apnea because I'll get a massage or something.
[03:46:42.720 --> 03:46:43.720]  I say I quit breathing for like a minute.
[03:46:43.720 --> 03:46:45.720]  So I'm finally doing a sleep study tonight.
[03:46:45.720 --> 03:46:46.720]  Oh, that should be.
[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:47.720]  And I won't get any sleep.
[03:46:47.720 --> 03:46:48.720]  So I won't be here tomorrow.
[03:46:48.720 --> 03:46:51.720]  I plan to come in later on the show and be a guest on the show.
[03:46:51.720 --> 03:46:52.720]  Good shard.
[03:46:52.720 --> 03:46:54.720]  He's going to be hosting tomorrow and you guys are going to be in as well.
[03:46:54.720 --> 03:46:55.720]  Pays and Alex Jones out.
[03:46:55.720 --> 03:46:56.720]  Don't worry.
[03:46:56.720 --> 03:46:58.720]  I'm coming in Sunday to be live, by the way.
[03:46:58.720 --> 03:46:59.720]  So it balances out.
[03:46:59.720 --> 03:47:00.720]  Like I got my walk here.
[03:47:00.720 --> 03:47:01.720]  We got to carry yourself.
[03:47:01.720 --> 03:47:04.720]  Literally the hardest working man in show business.
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:05.720]  No, no.
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:06.720]  You are.
[03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:07.720]  Not in show business.
[03:47:07.720 --> 03:47:08.720]  But as that's a saying that people say.
[03:47:08.720 --> 03:47:09.720]  In crazy business.
[03:47:09.720 --> 03:47:10.720]  Well, anyway.
[03:47:10.720 --> 03:47:11.720]  In news.
[03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:12.720]  So I didn't mean to interrupt you on the Burning Man thing.
[03:47:12.720 --> 03:47:13.720]  Jakari and Leigh Annan.
[03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:15.720]  Did you know I went to Burning Man back in.
[03:47:15.720 --> 03:47:16.720]  I know.
[03:47:16.720 --> 03:47:17.720]  Ten years ago.
[03:47:17.720 --> 03:47:18.720]  That's how old I am.
[03:47:18.720 --> 03:47:20.720]  I tried to talk about crew members that went into filming.
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:21.720]  Yeah.
[03:47:21.720 --> 03:47:22.720]  I hope he's filming.
[03:47:22.720 --> 03:47:23.720]  I'm going to be relaxing.
[03:47:23.720 --> 03:47:24.720]  Yeah.
[03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:25.720]  What?
[03:47:25.720 --> 03:47:31.720]  He doesn't realize that the FBI is gathering intelligence on all these activities out there.
[03:47:31.720 --> 03:47:32.720]  Yeah.
[03:47:32.720 --> 03:47:33.720]  There's definitely feds.
[03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:36.720]  And there's a lot of rich people there too who kind of skirt the system.
[03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:37.720]  Yeah.
[03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:38.720]  Everything gets tarnished.
[03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:42.720]  The only thing I had to worry about when I was in Burning Man was somebody stealing
[03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:43.720]  my bike.
[03:47:43.720 --> 03:47:44.720]  And that was it.
[03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:45.720]  That was what happened once.
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:46.720]  But I found it.
[03:47:46.720 --> 03:47:51.020]  Well, for me, I just kind of thought this was tied into the whole Jade Helm geospatial
[03:47:51.020 --> 03:47:52.020]  intelligence.
[03:47:52.020 --> 03:47:53.020]  Yeah.
[03:47:53.020 --> 03:47:58.520]  And because here, there, of course, they're going to be very interested in a society of
[03:47:58.520 --> 03:47:59.520]  people.
[03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:00.520]  Yeah.
[03:48:00.520 --> 03:48:01.520]  If you had a tie on, it would look better.
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:02.520]  This could be the new way.
[03:48:02.520 --> 03:48:03.520]  You know, I went and ate some Mexican food.
[03:48:03.520 --> 03:48:04.520]  Yeah.
[03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:05.520]  I'm fine now.
[03:48:05.520 --> 03:48:06.520]  There you go.
[03:48:06.520 --> 03:48:09.020]  It's a t-shirt, Alex Jones.
[03:48:09.020 --> 03:48:10.020]  You could act on it.
[03:48:10.020 --> 03:48:11.020]  I like Salacious Crumb.
[03:48:11.020 --> 03:48:12.020]  He sits on Jabba Thud.
[03:48:12.020 --> 03:48:13.020]  I don't see your Jabba Thud.
[03:48:13.020 --> 03:48:14.020]  I don't like Jabba Thud.
[03:48:14.020 --> 03:48:17.200]  Like, you know, Salacious Crumb sits there and like, kind of just makes comments.
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:20.020]  You can watch all this on infowords.com for slash show.
[03:48:20.020 --> 03:48:27.600]  See Alex Jones in studio in a t-shirt, his white t-shirt, he just got done eating.
[03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:28.600]  He needed to go.
[03:48:28.600 --> 03:48:30.100]  I guess he didn't like your breakfast tacos.
[03:48:30.100 --> 03:48:31.100]  Is that what happened?
[03:48:31.100 --> 03:48:33.320]  Well, you're working on it, though.
[03:48:33.320 --> 03:48:34.320]  That's the thing.
[03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:38.660]  If you're working on it, you know, you can't really get down on yourself because you're
[03:48:38.660 --> 03:48:39.660]  working on it.
[03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:41.160]  Well, look, it does put on me because I'm saving my body a lot of weight.
[03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:43.760]  And then these pants bunched up, but I may say I'm awesome.
[03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:44.760]  There he goes.
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:45.760]  I mean, I'm not stupid.
[03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:46.760]  I'm not that good.
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:50.200]  What do they call, they have the skinny bodies, they have the middle size bodies, they have
[03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:51.200]  the fat style bodies.
[03:48:51.200 --> 03:48:52.200]  They say big boned.
[03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:53.200]  No, they have the endomorphs.
[03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:54.200]  What's the middle one?
[03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:57.200]  I mean, I have the middle type body.
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:48:59.120]  You never know what's going to happen.
[03:48:59.120 --> 03:49:00.120]  You never do.
[03:49:00.120 --> 03:49:01.120]  Now, we need to get your car.
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:02.120]  He's got the good.
[03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:07.120]  Well, you have the body of like a guy that's 6'4", 6'5", but it's your legs that are
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:08.120]  short.
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:09.120]  Because you really, you should be about 6'5".
[03:49:09.120 --> 03:49:10.120]  So I'm like a bassid hound.
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:14.120]  You don't have the ears of a bassid hound.
[03:49:14.120 --> 03:49:19.480]  Hey, we do have a guy's Google, Alex Jones turns into a dog.
[03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:20.960]  Oh yeah, rough, rough Jones.
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:22.920]  Or Alex Jones changes species.
[03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:24.920]  You were a trans species there for a few days.
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:26.800]  That's your new identity.
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:30.680]  We actually, we had to take him out and walk him every couple hours.
[03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:32.480]  He refused to use the bathroom.
[03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:36.840]  It was crazy here at Info Wars, but it was all, it was, it was the weight of the world,
[03:49:36.840 --> 03:49:40.240]  I think, coming upon Alex Jones.
[03:49:40.240 --> 03:49:41.560]  It's always an adventure.
[03:49:41.560 --> 03:49:42.560]  I can't remember.
[03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:46.440]  I can't remember who it was, but we had a guest in one day.
[03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:50.320]  And it was the day we were shooting the SuperMail commercial with Shane Steiner.
[03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:54.760]  So we had this big guest in and Shane walked around like a caveman with a sword.
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:55.760]  Yeah.
[03:49:55.760 --> 03:49:56.760]  And they're like, what is this?
[03:49:56.760 --> 03:49:58.200]  I'm like, this is what we do, man.
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:49:59.200]  This is what we do.
[03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:01.200]  We're setting up as a crazy looking lab and we had drive-in.
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:03.640]  Hey, what about the quarterback getting reinstated?
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:04.640]  Oh, Brady.
[03:50:04.640 --> 03:50:06.840]  Oh, well, Joe Biggs is probably rejoicing about that.
[03:50:06.840 --> 03:50:07.840]  That was always a scam.
[03:50:07.840 --> 03:50:08.840]  Yeah.
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:09.840]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:50:09.840 --> 03:50:12.520]  That was, that was just to keep people interested in that.
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:13.520]  Nothing.
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:15.520]  And really it ended up being a whole show about nothing.
[03:50:15.520 --> 03:50:16.520]  Yeah.
[03:50:16.520 --> 03:50:17.520]  Sort of like a giant Seinfeld episode.
[03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:18.520]  Yeah.
[03:50:18.520 --> 03:50:19.520]  You got to keep people talking about the NFL.
[03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:23.520]  When I was a kid, speaking of the NFL, my parents had parties at their house.
[03:50:23.520 --> 03:50:24.520]  I watched TV.
[03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:26.520]  I was standing in front of the TV.
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:27.520]  Ah.
[03:50:27.520 --> 03:50:28.520]  So I'm kind of still doing it this time.
[03:50:28.520 --> 03:50:29.520]  There it is.
[03:50:29.520 --> 03:50:30.520]  There it is.
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:31.520]  Yeah.
[03:50:31.520 --> 03:50:32.520]  Look.
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:33.520]  Oh.
[03:50:33.520 --> 03:50:35.800]  He had those, those ears were surgically attached and then we had to surgically unattach
[03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:36.800]  them after we talked.
[03:50:36.800 --> 03:50:37.800]  Oh, and they found the version.
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:38.800]  He talked him off the.
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:39.800]  My version has more than seven of you.
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:40.800]  No, well, yeah.
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:41.800]  That's someone else took that.
[03:50:41.800 --> 03:50:42.800]  That's someone else took that.
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:43.800]  Yeah.
[03:50:43.800 --> 03:50:44.800]  They lubed your.
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:48.720]  You guys got to type in Alex Jones channel because Google loves to try to keep the truth
[03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:50.720]  from the people to show how popular it is.
[03:50:50.720 --> 03:50:52.220]  We'll be back with more.
[03:50:52.220 --> 03:50:53.220]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[03:50:53.220 --> 03:50:54.220]  I'm Rob Doot.
[03:50:54.220 --> 03:50:58.440]  Liam McAdoo, Alex Jones and Jakari Jackson all in studio right now and my head is being
[03:50:58.440 --> 03:50:59.440]  squished.
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:07.640]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:07.640 --> 03:51:09.480]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:09.480 --> 03:51:10.680]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:10.680 --> 03:51:12.760]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:12.760 --> 03:51:13.760]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:13.760 --> 03:51:15.640]  Well, I've been taking extendivite.
[03:51:15.640 --> 03:51:18.360]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:18.360 --> 03:51:19.360]  Extendivite.
[03:51:19.360 --> 03:51:20.360]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:20.360 --> 03:51:22.120]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:22.120 --> 03:51:25.760]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:25.760 --> 03:51:26.760]  Herbal.
[03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:27.760]  How can that help?
[03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:31.640]  Well, actually we've taken herbs for thousands of years and extendivite is doing the job
[03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:32.640]  for me.
[03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:34.600]  Does your doctor know about extendivite?
[03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:35.600]  Yeah.
[03:51:35.600 --> 03:51:37.760]  My doctor knows and he said it seems to be working for you.
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:38.960]  So don't stop taking it.
[03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:40.760]  I feel great taking extendivite.
[03:51:40.760 --> 03:51:42.000]  I don't want to stop.

[03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:17.600]  During the break CJ popped in and said it's like Bohemian Grove for the masses and in
[03:54:17.600 --> 03:54:18.600]  a way it is.
[03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:23.480]  There is a lot of giving yourself up we're not gonna but there's no redwoods and then
[03:54:23.480 --> 03:54:27.200]  they do burn a giant effigy actually they burn several things while you're there at
[03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:28.200]  Burning Man.
[03:54:28.200 --> 03:54:32.280]  It's very pagan even the way that everything's set up it's like a big sundial and it is and
[03:54:32.280 --> 03:54:37.320]  you know they're just taking you know the the symbols that we've had in our world throughout
[03:54:37.320 --> 03:54:40.160]  time summer pagan summer Christian.
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:45.040]  There's a guy there that builds some amazing he changes the names of him every year but
[03:54:45.040 --> 03:54:49.120]  he builds them out of the these puzzle because the puzzle piece factories and gets these
[03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:52.520]  intricate looking wood cutouts that are like gonna be thrown away.

[03:54:57.160 --> 03:55:00.120]  name is David Best if I remember.
[03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:03.640]  But getting away from Burning Man let's try to get through another couple callers got
[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:07.960]  Gerald in Arkansas are you gonna tell us the definition or the difference between lawyer
[03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:13.840]  and attorney Gerald yes I want to say you guys are doing a great job but can you hear

[03:55:34.840 --> 03:55:39.280]  the people need now here's the thing on the attorney you look you can look this up under
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:47.040]  Google the word attorney comes from the French word a torn ATOR in which means to take from
[03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:52.800]  the people and get to the landowner that's the old feudal system but what we're under
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:59.040]  here and I hear on anybody ever bring it up we're in a common law right that's where
[03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:07.560]  the all of our laws are the constitution was written on common law but anybody talking
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:12.880]  about it but they subverted this it's still in force is what I'm trying to get across
