[00:00.000 --> 00:15.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:15.200 --> 00:19.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.040 --> 00:28.760]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly
[00:28.760 --> 00:29.760]  what they are.
[00:29.760 --> 00:32.760]  There are two pairs of bunk beds in each bedroom and the living room.
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.200]  They are concentration camps.
[00:34.200 --> 00:39.440]  HHS provides the teens with six hours daily classroom instruction, access to arts and
[00:39.440 --> 00:45.080]  crafts, three meals a day in snacks, access to call centers to reconnect with family,
[00:45.080 --> 00:47.080]  then legal services.
[00:47.080 --> 00:51.560]  And as the contractor running the holding facility describes, most importantly, they
[00:51.560 --> 00:53.080]  provide playtime.
[00:53.080 --> 01:02.520]  Is it schools sports day, summer camp, with freshly made beds, eat all you can buffet
[01:02.520 --> 01:04.200]  and the inevitable video games?
[01:04.200 --> 01:13.800]  The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home of
[01:13.800 --> 01:17.200]  the free is extraordinarily disturbing.
[01:17.200 --> 01:22.200]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[01:22.200 --> 01:30.280]  Some protesters replace three flags at the front of the facility with a Mexican flag
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.280]  and an upside down U.S. flag spray-painted with a bombish eyes.
[01:35.280 --> 01:41.480]  You are more concerned with a f***ing piece of cloth than people who are locked in cages.
[01:41.480 --> 01:43.480]  Show it right in front of you.
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.480]  You know there's a flag in those two f***ings, right?
[01:47.480 --> 01:53.480]  There were American flags hanging all over these facilities that children were being
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.960]  separated from their parents in front of an American flag.
[01:57.960 --> 02:01.000]  Mr. Speaker, we do have a crisis at our border.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.400]  It is one of morality.
[02:03.400 --> 02:08.280]  As we have seen this current strategy unfold intentional and cruelly created by the Trump
[02:08.280 --> 02:09.280]  administration.
[02:09.280 --> 02:12.280]  If you're not happy here, then you can leave.
[02:12.280 --> 02:20.280]  White supremacists, white supremacists.
[02:20.280 --> 02:26.640]  The United States is running concentration camps.
[02:26.640 --> 02:27.640]  That's what she says.
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.880]  The United States is running concentration camps that doesn't matter that we've got
[02:32.880 --> 02:39.640]  video for the last three years of AP Unainment going inside these attention centers and
[02:39.640 --> 02:46.160]  they're nicer than most elementary school facilities around the country, but they don't
[02:46.160 --> 02:47.160]  care.
[02:47.160 --> 02:51.360]  They're doubling and tripling down, calling the guards murderers, saying they're killing
[02:51.360 --> 02:53.080]  children, they're drinking out of toilets.
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.040]  All of it is lies and they're getting away with it.
[02:56.040 --> 03:01.040]  The whole corporate media is getting away with this entire thing and it just shows you
[03:01.040 --> 03:05.840]  they'll just intensify the lies even more and the weakest-minded people out there, the
[03:05.840 --> 03:12.440]  most deranged, are now trying to kill border patrol and ICE officers because they believe
[03:12.440 --> 03:14.840]  that they're really killing children inside.
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.960]  Truth is, we're being totally rushed by tens of millions of people because they've been
[03:18.960 --> 03:19.960]  offered free stuff.
[03:19.960 --> 03:26.360]  I played local Texas newscast where they talk to the illegal aliens and they say, I've
[03:26.360 --> 03:29.840]  come here because I'm supposed to get free stuff and they look at whose paying for the
[03:29.840 --> 03:30.840]  ads.
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.240]  It's the U.S. State Department.
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.040]  You know, why doesn't Trump stop it?
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.960]  It was put into federal endowments by Obama and Trump can go stop it, but he's got so
[03:41.960 --> 03:43.360]  many things going on.
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.160]  The money's also fenced out to George Soros, who then distributes it back.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.920]  There was a Candace Owens rant where she's saying, I want this to go the most viral of
[03:51.920 --> 03:52.920]  any video I've ever done.
[03:52.920 --> 03:57.400]  And she's on her own now, she doesn't have anyone turning point USA, and she's a handheld
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.560]  camera shot, but it's a powerful rant.
[03:59.560 --> 04:03.960]  She speaks for all of us in her anger and makes the same points I make that these videos,
[04:03.960 --> 04:08.400]  these facilities where they're letting third party journalists in show that it's nicer
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.400]  than the summer camp.
[04:09.400 --> 04:16.240]  I just dropped my daughters off at a few weeks ago and it's very nice.
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.280]  And there's one problem with her video.
[04:19.280 --> 04:20.760]  She doesn't show the proof.
[04:20.760 --> 04:25.560]  So we just posted the video to infowars.com, I mean a minute ago they gave me the green
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.960]  light with her rant with all the added proof added to it.
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.720]  So that's coming up next segment and it's going to be posted to infowars.com.
[04:35.720 --> 04:37.040]  Has been posted.
[04:37.040 --> 04:41.120]  Every single person listening who's mad about this need to get the video with Candace Owens
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.880]  with the added proof because she doesn't have a crew or anybody to help her.
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.760]  Well, we'll help Candace.
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.200]  Paul first helped launch this great lady and infowars is proud that we helped incubate
[04:51.200 --> 04:54.640]  the work she's done as she's now reaching tens of millions of people.
[04:54.640 --> 04:55.640]  We're still here helping Candace.
[04:55.640 --> 04:56.640]  We'll be right back.
[04:56.640 --> 05:09.720]  So the info wars model is a self fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.640]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[05:14.640 --> 05:15.640]  one another.
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.280]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach.
[05:20.280 --> 05:25.040]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting, self sustaining,
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.280]  self structured, little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[05:29.280 --> 05:33.640]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.440]  and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[05:37.440 --> 05:41.800]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[05:41.800 --> 05:46.200]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.840]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[05:50.840 --> 05:55.140]  see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[06:20.840 --> 06:30.320]  It's Wednesday, July 19th, the year 2019, I'm your host Alex Jones and I say this every
[06:30.320 --> 06:35.240]  day because it's true, every day gets more intense, every day gets more insane.
[06:35.240 --> 06:44.680]  Let me tell you what's coming up today, incredible, powerful to the point grant by Candace Owens
[06:44.680 --> 06:50.840]  after she toured her third or fourth migrant detention center.
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.680]  But she's on her own now, she's not returning to point USA, she was too popular, the left
[06:55.680 --> 06:59.080]  attacked her so you know the conservatives all put their tail between their legs and
[06:59.080 --> 07:03.680]  peed on themselves and threw her under the bus, that's okay, that's what they do.
[07:03.680 --> 07:12.520]  So we're now Fox News host in Phoenix, who's an Emmy award winner, they caught her with
[07:12.520 --> 07:18.960]  a parlor account, which is just a conservative or open Facebook alternative and she got caught
[07:18.960 --> 07:22.640]  on tape being admonished that you're not supposed to say you're conservative, you'll
[07:22.640 --> 07:29.360]  get called extreme, so you can't even be a Republican now, FM, Fox 10 host responds
[07:29.360 --> 07:36.080]  to bosses who asked her to hide her right wing views and that's the attitude to this,
[07:36.080 --> 07:39.240]  you got to have because they're always moving the goalpost, you know, one day it's Alex
[07:39.240 --> 07:49.520]  Jones' band next gets, oh, Bible verses are now banned, Paul Watson answers his own question
[07:49.520 --> 07:53.440]  in this article on news wars.com that you might want to send every church you know of
[07:53.440 --> 07:57.640]  and maybe if they're real Christians they'll stand up and say that up is enough, hate speech,
[07:57.640 --> 08:02.240]  Facebook deletes post quoting peaceful Catholic theologian Bible passage to be banned next,
[08:02.240 --> 08:11.280]  well I don't think Paul's that big of a theologian, so he doesn't know, two of the things said
[08:11.280 --> 08:20.400]  by the priests that are banned are Bible verses, yes, so they are banning Bible verses, Canada
[08:20.400 --> 08:26.080]  is already doing this, areas of Europe are doing this, they're taking Christians children
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.080]  and giving them to Muslims as part of cultural enrichment and Poland's giving people from
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.120]  Sweden and other areas political asylum because the governments are saying Christianity's
[08:36.120 --> 08:40.440]  bad, I'm not kidding, we're going to take your children away and give you the Muslims
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.560]  their good and the BBC runs TV shows where for children where young people learn to convert
[08:45.560 --> 08:54.320]  to Islam and find peace, again the quote from the Catholic saint who expresses the opposite
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.200]  of hate speech he's essentially re-sign the words of Jesus Christ, that's exactly what
[08:59.200 --> 09:04.600]  he's doing and we're printing those Bible verses up right now where he said that men
[09:04.600 --> 09:13.320]  are hopeless creatures, the actual quote is hopelessly wicked, fallen, I'm going to
[09:13.320 --> 09:18.960]  give you those quotes coming up, anybody can just type in Bible verses about humanity
[09:18.960 --> 09:27.680]  being fallen, being hopelessly wicked, Romans 7, 24, 25, wretched men that I am who shall
[09:27.680 --> 09:40.080]  deliver me from the body of death, now, yet I'm going to print those and I'll be covering
[09:40.080 --> 09:45.440]  that coming up a little bit later, now that's just some of the things we have to cover here,
[09:45.440 --> 09:52.200]  oh and speaking of Facebook now banning Bible verses and reviewing and saying oh yes this
[09:52.200 --> 09:59.280]  is hateful to say humanity's fallen, now you know what's really going on here right, once
[09:59.280 --> 10:05.520]  you let them have the power in government or in academia or anywhere to say we don't
[10:05.520 --> 10:13.920]  have free speech anymore if we define it as hate speech, well then they're going to define
[10:13.920 --> 10:20.400]  everything they want to is that, hate speech is no speech, hate speech is authoritarianism,
[10:20.400 --> 10:28.920]  hate speech is the only truly dangerous hateful speech, it's the song of tyrants, it's the
[10:28.920 --> 10:34.480]  hurricane of tyranny, it's what knocks down its opposition and creates nightmare scenarios
[10:34.480 --> 10:44.040]  and real death camps and real concentration camps, remember YouTube just removed a video
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.960]  of Tommy Robinson defending himself saying he shouldn't go to prison for journalism,
[10:48.960 --> 10:53.920]  they removed that as hate speech and so people go to YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and
[10:53.920 --> 10:59.240]  they go it's not hateful to quote Jesus, they go yes it is and then you argue with them
[10:59.240 --> 11:05.200]  that it's not hate speech, hate speech is whatever the left says it is to take your speech and
[11:05.200 --> 11:08.560]  instead of saying you're the tyrant, you're the threat, you're the bad guy, you're the
[11:08.560 --> 11:16.680]  dick dastardly, you're the villain, you're the joker, you're the devil, you're the Hitler,
[11:16.680 --> 11:22.520]  you're the bad guy, you're the mousey tongue, they go oh please no I'm not hateful, I just
[11:22.520 --> 11:30.560]  quoted Jesus, well Jesus is bad, I guess you're right, see the trick, you know I like Joe
[11:30.560 --> 11:33.720]  Rogan, he's a good friend of mine, really smart guy and I like listening to him and
[11:33.720 --> 11:39.160]  he's Smith's some smart things but man he constantly has guests thought about the censorship
[11:39.160 --> 11:46.640]  and no debate, well that's not hateful what Alex said, making fun of the governor of Virginia,
[11:46.640 --> 11:53.280]  he's talking about keeping born babies comfortable, I mean that's hilarious, remember they had
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.960]  the head of Twitter on Jack Dorsey and Jack was talking about bad things I'd done, where
[11:58.960 --> 12:04.040]  I'd made fun of people and stuff and Joe goes well that's hilarious, that's not hate speech,
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.240]  Joe don't give them the moral authority to define something as evil so it doesn't have
[12:09.240 --> 12:14.680]  free speech, Joe will sit there constantly with banned comics and go over well that's
[12:14.680 --> 12:19.040]  not really bad, you're not really just like black people or you're not really against
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.160]  gay people, they should be able to say bad things, black people should be able to say
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.160]  whatever they want, white people, if you disagree with them don't like it then don't be friends
[12:27.160 --> 12:34.480]  with them, that's what speech is all about and I know everybody understands it when you
[12:34.480 --> 12:41.160]  step back two feet and go wait a minute, I remember I used to hear about the war on
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.840]  Christmas 20 years ago and I thought my listeners were exaggerating and I'd see news articles
[12:45.840 --> 12:51.920]  where they'd go, this eighth grade girl was suspended for a week for giving out Christmas
[12:51.920 --> 12:59.160]  cards, the school has a zero tolerance on violation of church and state and now it's
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.440]  everywhere, now they tell people don't wear a cross in the workplace, it might offend
[13:03.440 --> 13:11.080]  someone, separation of church and state means the government doesn't say we have an official
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.720]  religion like leftist environmentalism and carbon taxes and political correctness, that
[13:15.720 --> 13:21.040]  is the state religion now, they admit it's a religion, they just removed one religion
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.960]  as an operating system and brought in a new anti-human religion, see how that works and
[13:27.960 --> 13:31.880]  the little girl and her parents remember we had her on, there's been countless cases
[13:31.880 --> 13:38.400]  like this, I had to call them and so you need to get a lawyer and I said you understand
[13:38.400 --> 13:42.120]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, primitive for exercise
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.680]  thereof or the press or the right to a symbol and all that, I said you have a right to personally
[13:47.680 --> 13:53.120]  give people anything you want, to be a Harry Potter book was an example I used, Harry Potter
[13:53.120 --> 14:00.680]  was just coming out then, they're like oh you are right, well yeah, yeah you can hand
[14:00.680 --> 14:05.160]  out Buddhist cards, you can hand out Christian cards as long as it's at recess or after
[14:05.160 --> 14:10.400]  school or in between things, that's human interaction, prisoners in prisons are supposedly
[14:10.400 --> 14:16.280]  able to exchange notes unless it's a maximum security, I mean are these maximum security
[14:16.280 --> 14:23.720]  prisons where you can't give somebody a Christmas card or Starbucks gets in trouble, because
[14:23.720 --> 14:32.160]  now just Santa Claus iconography is seen as Christian which it's not, it's pagan, oh
[14:32.160 --> 14:39.840]  Tannenbaum, oh Tannenbaum, so this is an incredible time to be alive ladies and gentlemen, it's
[14:39.840 --> 14:47.960]  super dangerous and that's just some of the censorship news, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut
[14:47.960 --> 14:52.600]  admits that he's the former state attorney general and that he got into office on the
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.720]  back of Sandy Hook and that Senator Murphy did and that his son is running the operation
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.360]  to try to shut down info wars and he admits that and then he lies about me to the Google
[15:03.360 --> 15:09.320]  executives and says I want him 100% off Google, unsearchable and they said sir we're going
[15:09.320 --> 15:17.760]  to get it done soon, incredible admission of total censorship by a evil thug who wants
[15:17.760 --> 15:23.800]  to silence my speech and he does it on the backs of Sandy Hook victims, twisting what
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.960]  I ever said or did and then using it and how about Robbie Parker who's shooing me with
[15:28.960 --> 15:35.400]  his voice shaking like Robbie Parker is just Elvis, Jesus and the Loch Ness monster all
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.560]  rolled into one or unicorns or whatever and it's just like he is mean to Sandy Hook and
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.640]  they go we will have him banned, how Hitler basically is what the Google people say, I
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.880]  mean it is just so authoritarian, you want Hitler this is it, you want authoritarianism
[15:50.880 --> 15:56.360]  baby this is it, all pretty with a big old bow on it, wow and there's so much more coming
[15:56.360 --> 15:59.640]  up, I mean this is going to be one hell of a transmission.
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.520]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[16:03.520 --> 16:08.080]  my mother's house, I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.120]  them ever since, I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.120]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved, I can help you too, if you
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.400]  owe taxes you can't pay don't wait another day, there's no such thing as a hopeless tax
[16:20.400 --> 16:29.200]  case, call 800 34 no tax or go to my website DanPilla.com that's DanPilla.com DanPilla.com
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.440]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.680]  backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up this will be the most
[16:38.680 --> 16:42.600]  important message you'll ever hear, Bill Hyde here I want to tell you about a huge sale
[16:42.600 --> 16:47.440]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.040]  endless supply of electricity off the grid, the clearance price is a result of the historic
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.920]  flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi, because of the flooding

[18:03.000 --> 18:07.080]  Hey Alex, yeah I just wanted to say your show is a breath of fresh air, I talk to a lot
[18:07.080 --> 18:11.160]  of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody
[18:11.160 --> 18:15.560]  agrees with these wars, I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go
[18:15.560 --> 18:19.600]  to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the
[18:19.600 --> 18:22.160]  eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.560]  That's it, I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency, it's the only
[18:25.560 --> 18:28.840]  way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him, it's the time to be praying
[18:28.840 --> 18:29.840]  my friend.
[18:29.840 --> 18:32.520]  I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.200]  to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man, I would love to see you on air
[18:37.200 --> 18:40.120]  until you're 80 years old, I would love to see what you're talking about when you're
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.600]  80 but if they do shut you down, no you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles

[20:03.520 --> 20:29.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:29.920 --> 20:42.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up, they've got a big Democrat debate, it's part two on
[20:42.240 --> 20:47.160]  the 27th, we'll be here covering it live, talk about the circus coming to town.
[20:47.160 --> 20:55.760]  Okay, let's get to something that is incredibly important but also amazingly frustrating and
[20:55.760 --> 21:02.640]  really gets my blood boiling, Candace Owens, formerly Attorney Point, USA, great citizen
[21:02.640 --> 21:10.120]  activist and journalist and podcaster, she went and toured multiple facilities for herself,
[21:10.120 --> 21:14.240]  randomly went and picked some, they let her in as a journalist, they let anybody in, as
[21:14.240 --> 21:19.000]  long as you have signed paperwork not to show the children's faces.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.560]  I mean I remember when they were saying Trump was putting kids in concentration camps three
[21:22.560 --> 21:29.000]  years ago, AP and others went, we went, we got in and it looks like a nice elementary
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.800]  school and for the older kids it looks like a nice middle school or high school and we're
[21:34.800 --> 21:42.320]  paying for it, they're coming here and many of them up to a third are not with their biological
[21:42.320 --> 21:46.400]  family, we've got to find out what the hell's going on with the three or four or five-year-old
[21:46.400 --> 21:51.240]  being brought in, a lot of them being rented by their families as a soccer ball, as a football
[21:51.240 --> 21:56.320]  to get them across the border and I've played newscasts with the migrants admitting that,
[21:56.320 --> 22:01.680]  remember that famous footage, the woman going, I got ten kids, I'm having another one, somebody
[22:01.680 --> 22:06.560]  needs to take care of all these kids, remember that famous video, we'll play it in a minute,
[22:06.560 --> 22:12.680]  well it's the same thing here, look at all these kids, somebody needs to take care of
[22:12.680 --> 22:20.520]  these kids, so Candace Owens comes out, she's really pissed, she's outside the lavish facility,
[22:20.520 --> 22:30.600]  a lot of these are like at former nice hotels and stuff, we've gone and covered it and she
[22:30.600 --> 22:35.640]  gets angry and so she wants it to go viral, it is going viral, things got like a million
[22:35.640 --> 22:40.800]  views but only about a few hours but the problem is she's not returning point USA anymore,
[22:40.800 --> 22:46.040]  she doesn't have any crew, she's hand shooting this, well guess what, I saw the left this
[22:46.040 --> 22:51.280]  morning at 5am, I was first up looking at this, on her twitter going screw you, no it's
[22:51.280 --> 22:57.120]  a camp, you're lying, where's the proof, even though it's all over the internet, not on
[22:57.120 --> 23:04.800]  the nightly news showing that these aren't camps, but a little on Fox, but if you go
[23:04.800 --> 23:10.040]  to the actual local reports and the AP and our reports you can see the truth, so we've
[23:10.040 --> 23:18.840]  added the proof to the Candace Owens rant, so it's Candace Owens Powerful Migration
[23:18.840 --> 23:26.080]  Detention Center rant with video proof, we've posted it to YouTube, we're posting it to
[23:26.080 --> 23:31.360]  Twitter, you need to get this out because sitting members of Congress, all four of the
[23:31.360 --> 23:40.560]  four horsemen, AOC, Ilhan Omar, all of them, Presley, they're all saying that they're
[23:40.560 --> 23:46.240]  killing children, they're drinking out of toilets and that they're death camps, these
[23:46.240 --> 23:55.200]  are concentration camps and the guards are Nazis, and MSNBC shows photo shops of the guards
[23:55.200 --> 23:59.880]  as Nazis, this is outrageous, these people show up, we take care of them better than
[23:59.880 --> 24:04.680]  anybody in the world, Europe doesn't take care and they just dump them on the street,
[24:04.680 --> 24:10.960]  in many cases, other cases they take Section 8 housing from old people and give it to
[24:10.960 --> 24:16.280]  them, this is just crazy, but instead of oh look how loving and good we are, it turns
[24:16.280 --> 24:22.920]  into we're bad, all the disease coming in, by the way, separated migrant families are
[24:22.920 --> 24:28.040]  suing US government demanding 3 million for each child, that's the Democrat lawyers that
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.440]  they're sending into these to lie about conditions, sign off the Davids that senators then use
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.520]  against the border patrol and they go border patrol, kids don't have toothpaste, they don't
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.160]  have food, I know you're doing it, and the border patrol goes that's not true show proof,
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.200]  they go don't you talk back to me, I've played the clips, don't you talk back, are you telling
[24:47.200 --> 24:54.320]  me lawyers that are down there lying, one guy looks like a cartoon character, he's
[24:54.320 --> 25:02.960]  banging his fist and he goes well senator, I'm just telling you that's not true, think
[25:02.960 --> 25:09.640]  about the fraud of that, the dirty lawyers that are suing for 3 million for each kid
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.560]  that came here so that we could pay for them, by the way, big national poll in Mexico, the
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.040]  vast majority of Mexicans are upset about the open borders and say it's got to be shut
[25:20.040 --> 25:25.200]  down, but let's go to this powerful Candace Owens breakdown, the videos on M4s.com, spread
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.680]  it, get it out, if you want to resist, this is how you do it, this is the Candace Owens
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.280]  rant with the proof, here it is.
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.600]  I hope this is the most viral periscope video that I do, I genuinely hope that every single
[25:37.600 --> 25:43.480]  person retweets this, because what I have just seen, I am incensed, I am horrified and
[25:43.480 --> 25:52.920]  I am angry, okay, children are being mistreated in this country, they are not the children
[25:52.920 --> 25:58.560]  that are sent to ICE immigration centers, okay, they are the children that are in Chicago,
[25:58.560 --> 26:02.920]  they are the children that are in Baltimore, they are the children that are in Detroit,
[26:02.920 --> 26:08.320]  they are the children that are being ignored while the leftist drum up a bullshit narrative
[26:08.320 --> 26:13.720]  that these immigration centers are somehow harming people, the United States is running
[26:13.720 --> 26:21.440]  concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly what they are, two pairs
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.400]  of bunk beds in each bedroom and the living room, they are concentration camps, HHS provides
[26:26.400 --> 26:32.320]  the teens with six hours daily classroom instruction, access to arts and crafts, three meals a
[26:32.320 --> 26:38.800]  day in snacks, access to call centers to reconnect with family, then legal services and as the
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.400]  contractor running the holding facility describes, most importantly, they provide play time.
[26:44.400 --> 26:53.880]  Is it schools sports day, summer camp, with freshly made beds, eat all you can buffet
[26:53.880 --> 26:55.560]  and the inevitable video games?
[26:55.560 --> 27:04.880]  The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.640]  of the free is extraordinarily disturbing.
[27:08.640 --> 27:11.880]  Let me tell you what I just saw when I walked in there, okay, and by the way, I'm with an
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.800]  entire film crew, so I'm about to blow up this narrative in a way that the left is
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.720]  not expecting because they are filthy, disgusting liars and I'm sorry that I am so angry right
[27:20.720 --> 27:26.360]  now, but what I just saw was astonishing, okay, this place is nicer than where I went
[27:26.360 --> 27:30.760]  to the public school system, I went to Stanford, Connecticut public schools, this place is
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.800]  like an elementary school, there are colors on the wall everywhere, there's a nursing
[27:35.800 --> 27:41.240]  station that is so clean and so nice, where they dine, they're sitting down laughing,
[27:41.240 --> 27:45.880]  eating food, they have people that go to the counter that can participate, if they want,
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.040]  they can help cook, if they want, let me tell you what the activities they have here.
[27:50.040 --> 27:55.040]  I walked in on the woman that were in their arts and crafts session, they had just concluded
[27:55.040 --> 28:01.440]  their f***ing Zumba class, okay, in the same room that they do their f***ing Zumba, they
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.680]  also have to do their arts and crafts, okay, that's just for the woman side.
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.640]  All these immigrants say they came because free American services and assistance are
[28:10.640 --> 28:13.240]  being advertised in their home countries.
[28:13.240 --> 28:19.520]  They're all welcome, there is a sand volleyball court, there is a sand volleyball court which
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.560]  they're all welcome to play at any time that they want to in the center of the section.
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.360]  There are phones that line the entire place where there's a sand volleyball court, a foosball
[28:30.360 --> 28:32.800]  table, what else did I see?
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.040]  There are pool tables, there's a soccer field, okay, because in case they want to play soccer
[28:37.040 --> 28:42.040]  when they're outside, there should be a soccer field that is adjacent to the sand volleyball
[28:42.040 --> 28:43.800]  court where they can play.
[28:43.800 --> 28:47.720]  They're all laughing, they're having a good time, and listen, I'm not saying that people
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.480]  that come here should not be treated well, that's not the argument here, okay, but these
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.080]  people are treated great, they are treated fantastically.
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.880]  Everything I just saw there was somewhere, I thought I was...
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.400]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.640]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.560]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[29:14.560 --> 29:17.080]  that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.600]  I wonder how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:21.600 --> 29:22.800]  across America.
[29:22.800 --> 29:26.520]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.160]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:30.160 --> 29:33.800]  healthier I feel, I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.800 --> 29:39.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.480]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[29:58.360 --> 30:06.160]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[30:06.160 --> 30:10.720]  Yours and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented
[30:10.720 --> 30:12.440]  evil attacks as you've seen.
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.160]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how
[30:16.160 --> 30:20.360]  much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things
[30:20.360 --> 30:23.640]  you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and
[30:23.640 --> 30:24.640]  found out the truth.
[30:24.640 --> 30:29.000]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  in my heart.
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  I want you to know that love is right back at you, and I want to thank you for all you've
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.920]  to fight to the end, but I want to win, and without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and
[30:41.920 --> 30:44.440]  it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[30:44.440 --> 30:45.720]  The enemy could win.
[30:45.720 --> 30:47.840]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:47.840 --> 30:49.080]  We're being used by God.
[30:49.080 --> 30:50.320]  You're being used by God.
[30:50.320 --> 30:54.160]  This is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[30:54.160 --> 30:55.160]  of my heart.
[30:55.160 --> 31:00.440]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.440 --> 31:04.640]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators.
[31:04.640 --> 31:05.680]  They are technocrats.
[31:05.680 --> 31:09.480]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your
[31:09.480 --> 31:14.000]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  with AI gods.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.200]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[31:17.200 --> 31:20.840]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[31:20.840 --> 31:26.120]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[31:26.120 --> 31:31.400]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[31:31.400 --> 31:35.760]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[31:35.760 --> 31:41.480]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[31:41.480 --> 31:46.360]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[31:46.360 --> 31:47.360]  to find anywhere.
[31:47.360 --> 31:52.520]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[31:52.520 --> 32:01.120]  Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[32:01.120 --> 32:02.920]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[32:02.920 --> 32:06.320]  A Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because
[32:06.320 --> 32:10.760]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political, or legal for their illicit activities
[32:10.760 --> 32:11.760]  over two decades.
[32:11.760 --> 32:15.160]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[32:15.160 --> 32:18.440]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[32:18.440 --> 32:22.680]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[32:22.680 --> 32:25.760]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change, and they will become the
[32:25.760 --> 32:29.800]  Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[32:29.800 --> 32:34.080]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[32:34.080 --> 32:35.080]  the Great Depression.
[32:35.080 --> 32:40.080]  The infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[32:40.080 --> 32:44.840]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[32:44.840 --> 32:45.840]  free press.
[32:45.840 --> 32:50.240]  This collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[32:50.240 --> 32:54.000]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts, and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[32:54.000 --> 32:57.040]  time it's not happening, it's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[32:57.040 --> 33:03.560]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.
[33:03.560 --> 33:21.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.520 --> 33:34.960]  Well, tyranny's making its move, censorship is exploding all over the world, but these
[33:34.960 --> 33:40.400]  automated AI systems on Google and Facebook and Twitter, they can erase somebody's voice,
[33:40.400 --> 33:46.400]  somebody's name just by hitting a button, and Google has announced that they have algorithm
[33:46.400 --> 33:56.560]  systems in AI ready to remove my name, my voice print, my likeness from the internet.
[33:56.560 --> 34:03.000]  Facebook's already begun by announcing my image is illegal on their systems, they have
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.840]  the same filters that block child porn, unless it's a negative light, if it's disparaging
[34:08.840 --> 34:15.880]  or if you're organizing for my death, I'm not joking, this is not a Twilight Zone episode.
[34:15.880 --> 34:23.240]  If you're organizing my murder, that is authorized, now they changed it back last week saying only
[34:23.240 --> 34:28.640]  calling for violence is okay, not the murder, because of course that was illegal.
[34:28.640 --> 34:33.480]  So we're not kidding, a quick correction, because I go through a lot of videos in the
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.000]  morning and I was watching this Candace Owens video like five in the morning and I was like,
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.800]  oh, she left hurting point USA, look, she's shooting this video with her own hand held.
[34:41.800 --> 34:46.920]  I thought, oh, let's add the video proof, because we've got all the video inside these
[34:46.920 --> 34:49.640]  centers, to show it super nice.
[34:49.640 --> 34:54.120]  Then I missed the two seconds where she's like, this is coming out, I got a film crew.
[34:54.120 --> 34:58.640]  And then you see two film crew guys like 50 feet behind her, so that's good.
[34:58.640 --> 35:01.240]  But I was wondering like, wow, why is she showing all this?
[35:01.240 --> 35:06.800]  And we already know this, I'm glad she's angry, we all should be angry, I'm angry.
[35:06.800 --> 35:08.280]  Why is she showing the video inside?
[35:08.280 --> 35:15.600]  Well, notice from Texas and California and Arizona, we spliced in footage that AP released
[35:15.600 --> 35:23.600]  yesterday, showing exactly what she said she found in Florida and is going to be showing,
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.600]  because all the facilities are the same.
[35:28.600 --> 35:35.000]  That's the facility for women and children and unaccompanied children.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.440]  And I'm going to say it again, one third are either alone or not with a family member.
[35:42.440 --> 35:47.000]  And we're just supposed to take five year olds and 10 year olds and eight year olds
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.360]  and three year olds and just let them wander down the street.
[35:51.360 --> 36:02.000]  That's concentration camps, collapsing hellish Guatemala, collapsing hellish Venezuela, MS-13,
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.840]  thousands of murders a week in Central America.
[36:05.840 --> 36:14.160]  I have an article today out of AP about it, hundreds of machete deaths a day in El Salvador
[36:14.160 --> 36:21.360]  in Nicaragua, massive attacks here in the US, same thing happening, severed heads being
[36:21.360 --> 36:27.280]  dropped off and delivered at police stations, barely makes the news.
[36:27.280 --> 36:37.960]  And then AOC gets up there on television and she says, just give back Candace Owens back
[36:37.960 --> 36:38.960]  to the beginning.
[36:38.960 --> 36:41.440]  We already heard about three minutes of, but I want to hear the last minute, but let's
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.320]  just, let's hear the whole thing, unedited ears, we don't, you know, run into a break
[36:45.320 --> 36:46.320]  again, my fault.
[36:46.320 --> 36:54.080]  I looked at the clock wrong and she's angry, you should be angry too, because you're being
[36:54.080 --> 36:59.040]  called a Nazi, your taxpayer money pays for this.
[36:59.040 --> 37:01.680]  Our board patrol has one of the hardest, roughest jobs there is.
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.040]  They work their butts off, compared to the average beat cop or FBI agent who work a lot
[37:07.040 --> 37:08.040]  too.
[37:08.040 --> 37:13.520]  I mean, it's grueling, it's rough, it's, in some areas, one person is processing up
[37:13.520 --> 37:17.280]  to 50 people a day, can you imagine?
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.240]  And they're sick and they've got diarrhea and they're vomiting all over themselves and
[37:22.240 --> 37:29.160]  the guards are getting, and the board patrol are getting all sorts of diseases, typhus
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.760]  and TB and can you imagine?
[37:34.760 --> 37:38.360]  Have you ever been around a car wreck or something and you, you see a car wreck, you see somebody
[37:38.360 --> 37:43.000]  hurt, how stressful that is when you go home, how you're exhausted, you ever see somebody
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.560]  with their leg cut off or something and you put a tourniquet around them or whatever and
[37:46.560 --> 37:48.520]  you go home and you collapse, you're exhausted.
[37:48.520 --> 37:49.640]  I've done a few things like that.
[37:49.640 --> 37:53.440]  I've, I've seen stuff like that and you go home, you're just exhausted.
[37:53.440 --> 37:59.160]  Imagine doing that all day long, eight, nine, 10 hours a day in 110 degree heat, 115 degree
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.200]  heat, 120 degree heat and you're being told, you're a piece of crap.
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.760]  You're getting shot at, you're getting killed and you get to turn the TV on and you get
[38:08.760 --> 38:14.920]  to hear how you're a Nazi and AOC knows damn well she's a liar.
[38:14.920 --> 38:24.680]  Yeah, they captured 15,000 people this year in one Texas area and had it one facility
[38:24.680 --> 38:30.040]  15,000 and it turned out that the board patrol had to work seven days a week for a month
[38:30.040 --> 38:31.040]  then.
[38:31.040 --> 38:37.000]  Some of them were working 20 hour shifts, people were collapsing, loading them on buses and
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.360]  feeding them and just getting them into the United States and other centers.
[38:41.360 --> 38:52.800]  It was 14,000 plus people, the board patrol reported in one day, 14,000 people.
[38:52.800 --> 38:59.160]  You imagine 14,000 people showing up at your church, let's say your church is 1,000 people.
[38:59.160 --> 39:05.440]  What if 14,000 showed up and said, wipe my ass, cook me dinner and if you don't get it
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.200]  just write, just write on time, you're a Nazi, you're a concentration camp guard.
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.960]  This is the most viral periscope video that I do.
[39:13.960 --> 39:19.680]  I genuinely hope that every single person retweets this because what I have just seen,
[39:19.680 --> 39:25.960]  I am incensed, I am horrified and I am angry, okay?
[39:25.960 --> 39:29.400]  Children are being mistreated in this country.
[39:29.400 --> 39:34.480]  They are not the children that are sent to ICE immigration centers, okay?
[39:34.480 --> 39:38.560]  They are the children that are in Chicago, they are the children that are in Baltimore,
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.920]  they are the children that are in Detroit, they are the children that are being ignored
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.440]  while the leftists drum up a bullshit narrative that these immigration centers are somehow
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.440]  harming people.
[39:49.440 --> 39:58.240]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly
[39:58.240 --> 39:59.240]  what they are.
[39:59.240 --> 40:02.040]  Two pairs of bunk beds in each bedroom and the living room.
[40:02.040 --> 40:03.680]  They are concentration camps.
[40:03.680 --> 40:08.880]  HHS provides the teens with six hours daily classroom instruction, access to arts and
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.640]  crafts, three meals a day in snacks, access to call centers to reconnect with family,
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.960]  then legal services and as the contractor running the holding facility describes, most
[40:19.960 --> 40:22.480]  importantly they provide play time.
[40:22.480 --> 40:31.960]  Is it school sports day, summer camp, with freshly made beds, eat all you can buffet
[40:31.960 --> 40:33.680]  in the inevitable video games?
[40:33.680 --> 40:43.000]  The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.760]  of the free is extraordinarily disturbing.
[40:46.760 --> 40:49.080]  Let me tell you what I just saw when I walked in there, okay?
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.280]  And by the way, I'm with an entire film crew.
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.800]  So I'm about to blow up this narrative in a way that the left is not expecting because
[40:54.800 --> 40:59.600]  they are filthy, disgusting liars and I am sorry that I am so angry right now, but what
[40:59.600 --> 41:02.560]  I just saw was astonishing, okay?
[41:02.560 --> 41:06.240]  This place is nicer than where I went to the public school system.
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.480]  I went to Stanford, Connecticut public schools.
[41:08.480 --> 41:10.400]  This place is like an elementary school.
[41:10.400 --> 41:13.240]  There are colors on the wall everywhere.
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.560]  There's a nursing station that is so clean and so nice where they dine.
[41:17.560 --> 41:20.240]  They're sitting down laughing, eating food.
[41:20.240 --> 41:24.000]  They have people that go to the counter that can participate if they want.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.160]  They can help cook if they want.
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.120]  Let me tell you what activities they have here.
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.160]  I walked in on the woman that were in their arts and crafts session.
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.200]  They had just concluded their f***ing Zumba class, okay?
[41:36.200 --> 41:41.040]  In the same room that they do their f***ing Zumba, they also have to do their arts and
[41:41.040 --> 41:42.280]  crafts, okay?
[41:42.280 --> 41:43.760]  That's just for the woman side.
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.960]  All these immigrants say they came because free American services and assistance are being
[41:48.960 --> 41:51.320]  advertised in their home countries.
[41:51.320 --> 41:52.480]  They're all welcome.
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.160]  There is a sand volleyball court.
[41:56.160 --> 42:00.280]  There is a sand volleyball court, which they are all welcome to play at any time that they
[42:00.280 --> 42:03.640]  want to in the center of the section.
[42:03.640 --> 42:08.440]  There are phones that line the entire place where there's a sand volleyball court, a foosball
[42:08.440 --> 42:09.440]  table.
[42:09.440 --> 42:10.880]  What else did I see?
[42:10.880 --> 42:12.000]  There are pool tables.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.040]  There's a soccer field, okay?
[42:14.040 --> 42:16.480]  Because in case they want to play soccer when they're outside, there should be a soccer
[42:16.480 --> 42:21.880]  field that is adjacent to the sand volleyball courts where they can play.
[42:21.880 --> 42:22.880]  They're all laughing.
[42:22.880 --> 42:23.880]  They're having a good time.
[42:23.880 --> 42:28.160]  I'm not saying that people that come here should not be treated well.
[42:28.160 --> 42:30.200]  That's not the argument here, okay?
[42:30.200 --> 42:32.000]  But these people are treated great.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.400]  They are treated fantastically.
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.920]  Everything that I just saw there was somewhere, I thought I was touring a place to send my
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.880]  child to elementary school.
[42:39.880 --> 42:42.720]  And by the way, I would have sent my child to this elementary school.
[42:42.720 --> 42:45.680]  This is an ICE facility in Broward County.
[42:45.680 --> 42:49.600]  The source of so much debate and anger, and everyone came down the Florida because the
[42:49.600 --> 42:51.160]  left did what they do best.
[42:51.160 --> 43:00.080]  They made up a fucking narrative that is completely false and untrue.
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.960]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[43:03.960 --> 43:07.720]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago
[43:07.720 --> 43:10.880]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.120]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were,
[43:14.120 --> 43:16.800]  and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[43:16.800 --> 43:20.200]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[43:20.200 --> 43:21.200]  shut us down.
[43:21.200 --> 43:23.560]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[43:23.560 --> 43:24.560]  wonderful they were.
[43:24.560 --> 43:26.400]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[43:26.400 --> 43:29.320]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[43:29.320 --> 43:30.720]  He claims they're supplements.
[43:30.720 --> 43:36.080]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[43:36.080 --> 43:38.560]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[43:38.560 --> 43:41.160]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[43:41.160 --> 43:45.040]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate
[43:45.040 --> 43:46.040]  it and do different things.
[43:46.040 --> 43:47.360]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[43:47.360 --> 43:51.320]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[43:51.320 --> 43:53.200]  God's medicine chest.
[43:53.200 --> 44:00.320]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[44:00.320 --> 44:06.240]  Serving with Infowars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[47:13.280 --> 47:30.640]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[47:30.640 --> 47:35.880]  Okay, I've just spent a lot of the hour on the hopes that we have children in concentration
[47:35.880 --> 47:36.880]  camps.
[47:36.880 --> 47:40.120]  Now, I know you know that that's all a fraud.
[47:40.120 --> 47:48.160]  After Clinton, they actually built FEMA camps for a civil war and tasked Delta Force to
[47:48.160 --> 47:54.120]  go in and take over cities and capital cities if governors fought back against a federal
[47:54.120 --> 47:55.620]  takeover.
[47:55.620 --> 47:58.320]  That was Clinton's delusion of grandeur.
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.560]  Now, how did I know about that?
[48:01.560 --> 48:04.640]  I got told about it by the military.
[48:04.640 --> 48:08.880]  Then once I got heavily involved in it, some of the military that was being ordered to
[48:08.880 --> 48:14.240]  do it came to me and said, Jones, we know you're like 25 years old and everything, we'll explain
[48:14.240 --> 48:15.240]  something to you.
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.680]  We're the ones that told law enforcement, so they told you.
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.400]  So stop acting like we're the bad guys, dumbass.
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.600]  And I was like, oh, really, yeah, yeah, we were given the orders.
[48:28.600 --> 48:32.760]  We leaked the information so people know about it, the soldier of fortune and others.
[48:32.760 --> 48:37.040]  So when you get off our ass, I was like, oh, yeah, well, thanks for telling me.
[48:37.040 --> 48:44.360]  So that's the learning process in life, ladies and gentlemen, because you can be intelligent,
[48:44.360 --> 48:47.960]  but you don't have all the pieces, so you make bad assumptions.
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.560]  But still, I was going in the right direction that Bill Clinton was trying to prepare and
[48:52.560 --> 48:58.040]  test to see if he could get the military to bring in martial law.
[48:58.040 --> 49:00.640]  That's a real danger when you've got a bad leadership.
[49:00.640 --> 49:02.640]  That happens all over the world and in history.
[49:02.640 --> 49:05.600]  That's a real thing.
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.760]  Including Latin America, collapsing North Africa, collapsing Middle East, collapsing
[49:11.760 --> 49:18.960]  near Asia, Central Asia, coming into Europe, coming into here, the UN funding it.
[49:18.960 --> 49:22.280]  That's an artificial globalist outside attack.
[49:22.280 --> 49:30.480]  And our government's designed and constitutionally built to deal with that.
[49:30.480 --> 49:37.960]  So see, that's not tyranny, that's normal operation of constitutional government.
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.920]  So it really is incredible to see them trying this, but the good news is the wheels are coming
[49:41.920 --> 49:42.920]  off of it.
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.440]  The Democrat real poll numbers are going straight down, even then the CNN admits Trump's officially
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.440]  broken Washington.
[49:49.440 --> 49:52.200]  No, you broke yourselves.
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.920]  But even Obama, remember a few years ago before he left office was saying, hey, just
[49:56.920 --> 50:02.560]  be in poor or whatever, it's not a prerequisite to come here and to get asylum.
[50:02.560 --> 50:03.800]  That's not what asylum is.
[50:03.800 --> 50:04.800]  Here it is.
[50:04.800 --> 50:10.320]  I felt like some of the stories were a little overprint.
[50:10.320 --> 50:19.040]  And as I explained to my fellow presidents, under U.S. law, we admit a certain number
[50:19.040 --> 50:25.160]  of refugees from all around the world based on some fairly narrow criteria.
[50:25.160 --> 50:34.440]  And typically, refugee status is not granted just based on economic need or because a family
[50:34.440 --> 50:37.840]  lives in a bad neighborhood or poverty.
[50:37.840 --> 50:41.280]  It's typically defined fairly narrowly.
[50:41.280 --> 50:49.160]  You have a state, for example, that was targeting a political activist and they need to get
[50:49.160 --> 50:53.280]  out of the country for pure prosecution or even death.
[50:53.280 --> 51:02.560]  There may be some narrow circumstances in which there is a humanitarian or refugee status
[51:02.560 --> 51:05.800]  that a family might be eligible for.
[51:05.800 --> 51:10.040]  If that were the case, it would be better for them to be able to apply in country rather
[51:10.040 --> 51:18.800]  than take a very dangerous journey all the way up to Texas to make those same claims.
[51:18.800 --> 51:24.920]  But I think it's important to recognize that that would not necessarily accommodate a large
[51:24.920 --> 51:28.520]  number of additional migrants.
[51:28.520 --> 51:34.720]  What's more important is going to be for us to be able to find the kinds of solutions
[51:34.720 --> 51:35.720]  both.
[51:35.720 --> 51:42.800]  So, anybody who wants to go to infowars.com, they can pull that story up from yesterday.
[51:42.800 --> 51:46.200]  Flashback Obama said crime and poverty are not qualifiers for asylum.
[51:46.200 --> 51:53.320]  If your country, say, got bombed by its nearby country and overrun, that's refugee status.
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.440]  And that's usually the closest country that's culturally more similar to you that's stable
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.560]  that should take you in if they can.
[52:01.560 --> 52:05.040]  And then countries have meetings together and decide who's going to take what.
[52:05.040 --> 52:08.920]  That is very humanitarian, a very American thing to do and we're the most open in the
[52:08.920 --> 52:11.920]  world.
[52:11.920 --> 52:18.800]  That now by the alchemy of Democrat lies turns into we're killing children, they're drinking
[52:18.800 --> 52:28.040]  out of toilets, these are death camps and it's a total hoax, it's total lie, it's total
[52:28.040 --> 52:32.560]  fraud from one end to the other and back again.
[52:32.560 --> 52:36.880]  And you got to ask yourself and the audience is like, yeah, Alex, we knew three years ago
[52:36.880 --> 52:39.400]  that these weren't death camps and we understand that.
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.960]  I know, but a lot of the public doesn't know that like when they say I'm a Russian agent
[52:44.960 --> 52:48.960]  or they say, you know, Trump's doing all this bad stuff.
[52:48.960 --> 52:56.840]  These people believe this garbage, in fact, let's play another clip here of just a compilation
[52:56.840 --> 53:01.200]  of Democrats sounding just like Trump until just a few years ago.
[53:01.200 --> 53:09.320]  And again, they have such the stain for you, they disrespect you so much that at first
[53:09.320 --> 53:13.400]  they said there was no refugee crisis, there were no caravans that we'll get to that next
[53:13.400 --> 53:14.400]  segment.
[53:14.400 --> 53:17.520]  I've got a bunch of the news, but speaking of censorship, this is so important.
[53:17.520 --> 53:20.640]  This is such a crazy story that I'm going to tell it.
[53:20.640 --> 53:26.080]  I called Tim Frosier in my office yesterday, he's our operations manager, good friend of
[53:26.080 --> 53:27.080]  mine.
[53:27.080 --> 53:39.000]  And I said, do you remember last week I said we're going to sell out of the new Betsy Ross
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  American flag.
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.760]  These colors don't run America's back shirts, which we did sell out of.
[53:42.760 --> 53:47.000]  Thanks for the support, folks, but the price we sell them, we got to sell a ton of them
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  to fund the operation, but we did sell 4,000.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.840]  And I said, I told folks it's a pop or we have a new variant.
[53:52.840 --> 53:57.800]  And I said, I want the new variant to be an American flag, a Betsy Ross, but also another
[53:57.800 --> 54:08.640]  just classic American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[54:08.640 --> 54:14.920]  And on the back, America's back info wars.com.
[54:14.920 --> 54:23.200]  Last night I'm on info wars.com and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[54:23.200 --> 54:31.360]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, of course it's a common sense shirt, but what's
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.920]  better than just an American flag about a don't try it on me under the flag saying don't
[54:35.920 --> 54:36.920]  try on the American flag.
[54:36.920 --> 54:37.920]  It's a perfect combo.
[54:37.920 --> 54:38.920]  So great minds think alike.
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.560]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar
[54:42.560 --> 54:45.060]  design.
[54:45.060 --> 54:46.600]  And so that's the new limited edition.
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.760]  We're printing 4,000, by the way.
[54:48.760 --> 54:52.800]  Just yesterday, the 4,000 shirts of the Betsy Ross flag arrived, the ones that are already
[54:52.800 --> 54:53.800]  sold out.
[54:53.800 --> 54:55.760]  Those are now shipping today.
[54:55.760 --> 54:57.800]  Anyone wants this new limited edition?
[54:57.800 --> 55:04.320]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[55:04.320 --> 55:08.040]  by the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[55:08.040 --> 55:11.360]  And I'm told by folks that know Chris Pratt, I think it's pretty obvious he's a Christian
[55:11.360 --> 55:15.560]  and is criticized for that, that the guy is a patriot.
[55:15.560 --> 55:23.520]  Of course, Kurt Russell, Clint Eastwood, anybody it seems that I like on the screen was already
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.520]  a truly a weak person.
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.360]  So that's exciting because this is inspired by the shirt he's wearing, but it reminded
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.680]  me that I was already having the shirt designed.
[55:32.680 --> 55:35.400]  And Tim's like, wow, that's crazy.
[55:35.400 --> 55:36.920]  But no, it's really not crazy.
[55:36.920 --> 55:37.920]  Think about it.
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.600]  Don't tread on me because they're tread on the American flag and then the snakes with
[55:42.600 --> 55:43.800]  it.
[55:43.800 --> 55:45.160]  And it just really works well.
[55:45.160 --> 55:50.800]  We did a little bit better design, I think, but it's a, you know, battle, you know, cattered
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.520]  flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter that's in the Star Spangled Banner song or
[55:55.520 --> 55:56.520]  National Anthem.
[55:56.520 --> 56:03.960]  And again, on the back, it says America's Back in Full Wars.com.
[56:03.960 --> 56:09.440]  So I am very, very proud of that new shirt.
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.680]  America's Back in Full Wars.com, 4,000 of these babies.
[56:15.680 --> 56:16.680]  And that's it.
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.040]  Tim doesn't like to be on camera, but I told him, I said, Tim, at least you an audio ad
[56:21.040 --> 56:29.040]  with me, we're reenacting what happened or talking about it because that's a cool story.
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.200]  That I mean, I'm in there, the graphics folks, I want an American flag and I want the Betsy
[56:33.200 --> 56:34.200]  Ross ones.
[56:34.200 --> 56:37.840]  That's two different shirts, four different variants, just like the last shirt.
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.600]  And they go, well, how do you want the snake?
[56:39.600 --> 56:42.240]  I don't know, kind of fade it into it.
[56:42.240 --> 56:48.800]  But you know, where you see it and then Chris Pratt is wearing one just like it.
[56:48.800 --> 56:52.960]  And then he gets in trouble and the left says it's racist and they're gonna unfollow him
[56:52.960 --> 56:56.360]  and Hollywood's not sure now, you know, you wore an American flag.
[56:56.360 --> 56:58.960]  It's a white supremacist symbol.
[56:58.960 --> 57:00.360]  They said Betsy Ross was one.
[57:00.360 --> 57:01.860]  She was an abolitionist.
[57:01.860 --> 57:05.640]  The average leftist is so dumb, they don't know abolitionists were the Christian movement
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.200]  out of England and the United States that banned slavery worldwide.
[57:09.200 --> 57:14.280]  And England went to war with at least 11 countries to ban it and lost over 100,000 sailors and
[57:14.280 --> 57:21.480]  Marines, guess they're called Dragoons.
[57:21.480 --> 57:26.640]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowarstore.com.
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.960]  You had printed the USA right now and I had to extend the 1776 worldwide special just
[57:31.960 --> 57:35.720]  because I'm so busy, the new specials and new ads aren't cut because I'm just focusing
[57:35.720 --> 57:36.720]  on news.
[57:36.720 --> 57:39.080]  It was up until seven o'clock last night fighting hard.
[57:39.080 --> 57:44.040]  Thanks for your support infowarstore.com, take advantage of that sale one more day infowarstore.com.
[57:44.040 --> 57:47.480]  We'll be right back, the most banned broadcast in the world.
[57:47.480 --> 57:54.000]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  this.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.840]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info war 50% off, but we make
[57:58.840 --> 58:02.120]  only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[58:02.120 --> 58:06.440]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[58:06.440 --> 58:10.280]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[58:10.280 --> 58:12.960]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[58:12.960 --> 58:16.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.800]  I want to expand, not contract.
[58:17.800 --> 58:20.200]  And for six months, we've not just been able to stand still.
[58:20.200 --> 58:24.720]  The enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[58:24.720 --> 58:25.720]  I like to be expanding.
[58:25.720 --> 58:26.720]  I like to be winning.
[58:26.720 --> 58:27.720]  I like to be fighting.
[58:27.720 --> 58:28.720]  And we are winning the info war.
[58:28.720 --> 58:29.720]  That's why we're so hated.
[58:29.720 --> 58:30.960]  But we need to be retreaded.
[58:30.960 --> 58:31.960]  We need to be tuned up.
[58:31.960 --> 58:33.240]  We need to be fixed up.
[58:33.240 --> 58:34.520]  We never have time to get into drive up.
[58:34.520 --> 58:38.720]  We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us.
[58:38.720 --> 58:41.040]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[58:41.040 --> 58:43.160]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[58:43.160 --> 58:46.280]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign
[58:46.280 --> 58:47.280]  banks and the tricombs.
[58:47.280 --> 58:51.120]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[58:51.120 --> 58:55.080]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[58:55.080 --> 58:59.560]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[58:59.560 --> 59:04.440]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[59:04.440 --> 59:06.920]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[59:06.920 --> 59:08.640]  It is completely independent of all that.
[59:08.640 --> 59:14.360]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[59:14.360 --> 59:17.720]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with.
[59:17.720 --> 59:21.720]  At the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[59:21.720 --> 59:24.560]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[59:24.560 --> 59:27.920]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[59:27.920 --> 59:31.920]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[59:31.920 --> 59:35.880]  what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[59:35.880 --> 59:38.120]  And the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[59:38.120 --> 59:42.920]  The they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[59:42.920 --> 59:43.920]  and freedom.
[59:43.920 --> 59:47.760]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of deep platforming, defamation,
[59:47.760 --> 1:00:16.720]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:22.320]  And you can quantify it or name it whatever you want.
[1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:28.640]  But if tyrants start oppressing you and you accept it, then you'll be like the frog in
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:30.680]  the pot that slowly boils.
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:31.680]  Everybody knows about that concept.
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:35.040]  I guess it's the frog in the pot concept.
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:39.960]  If you resist it long enough, you will become stronger, you will overcome it.
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:44.880]  It's the law of nature, it's like we couldn't beat the North Vietnamese because it was their
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:50.720]  land and they'd been fighting folks for 2,000 years and they weren't going to back down.
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:53.800]  So if we didn't basically kill every one of them, they're not going to lose.
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:56.600]  Well, it's the same thing with us.
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:59.840]  Nobody's going to conquer America unless it's from within.
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:05.760]  And unless they start with, oh, just don't be a Nazi, well, I'm not a Nazi, that's fine.
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:07.240]  Well, just don't let them have speech.
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:08.240]  Okay, sure.
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.600]  Oh, just don't say something that hurts people's feelings.
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:14.040]  Don't call people homosexuals.
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:17.000]  That's a scientific term like heterosexual.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.720]  Just when you call us gay, okay, I don't want to hurt your feelings, sure.
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:24.320]  Pretty soon, don't call yourself father or mother.
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:27.720]  By the way, we're going to teach your son, they're really a girl.
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:32.720]  Do what I want or I'm going to report you.
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:37.160]  And by then, ladies and gentlemen, the systems got you.
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:39.840]  They got you by the short hairs.
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:41.600]  They got you right where they want you.
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:48.520]  And we know from Europe and Canada, Canada is one of the worst, Canada is incredibly authoritarian.
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:02:00.440]  Great people, wonderful people, friendly, nice, but very naive, like a lot of Americans.
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:07.280]  And I've seen, I'm not going to exaggerate, 500 articles over the 20 years, 25 years I've
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:13.240]  been on air where preachers would get arrested for preaching passages out of the Bible and
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:16.920]  people would come sit the church and hear it, go report it and the police would come
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:19.880]  and arrest them.
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:26.480]  Now there are cases where in California and places in Canada, where if you say that a
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:31.160]  guy with a beard who's six foot two is a man, you get arrested.
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:33.760]  You lose, use the wrong pronoun.
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:34.760]  That's a cult.
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:36.840]  That's living in a prison.
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:41.600]  And so I've got a stack of articles here, where they're now going after Christians in
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:43.600]  the U.S.
[1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:49.800]  And Facebook, again, is banning Bible verses.
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:53.280]  Paul asked, you know, how soon, how soon till they ban Bible verses?
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:03:03.400]  Well, the famous quote by a priest is a composite of Bible verses.
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:07.660]  Now if you try to put those verses in, Facebook is banning you as well.
[1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:12.720]  So that's the frog with the water boiling.
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.440]  If we don't jump out now, it's burning our butt.
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:18.240]  It's burning our little suction feet.
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.400]  Yeah, we're showing real footage on television.
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:28.840]  If you're a TV viewer, radio listeners, go to infolvers.com, of a real example of a frog
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:35.880]  in a pot and you turn the water up incrementally and they just, like they're in a hot tub,
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:36.880]  go to sleep.
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.920]  Then you can pull them out, salt their legs up and eat them.
[1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:46.960]  If you're in the French, French Louisiana cooking, I've had plenty of frog legs.
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:49.080]  But that's how this works.
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:51.000]  You know, I'm not a frog in the pot, man.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:57.160]  I'm like, I'm in the pot, my ass is burning, my feet, my eyes are rolling back in my head
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:03:59.920]  because we're all collectively have to jump out together.
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:00.920]  We're the frog.
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:04.840]  I'm sitting there going, you ever had a, I'm gonna call it a night terror, but I've had
[1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.400]  it before where you wake up and you can't move.
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:12.040]  You're still asleep, but you're conscious and your eyes are open and you can't move
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:16.520]  because your lower brain has disconnected from your spinal cord.
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:20.200]  You've ever been sleeping next to your wife and they go to sleep and they kind of, you
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:26.240]  know, there's like a pop or like a clunk and that's when your brain basically disconnects
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:32.000]  from the spinal cord and you start going to deeper sleep and you ever had your eyes open
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.360]  and you have to will yourself to like kind of go back asleep and wake back up.
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:38.120]  I know how to get out of those.
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:42.040]  Now that I'm 45, that happens once a year or so, but I was like 15 years old, so that
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:43.160]  was horrifying as hell.
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:46.920]  Open your eyes up, can't get up, can't move, got to take a piss.
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:47.920]  Well, it's the same thing.
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:48.920]  I'm like the frog.
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:49.920]  We're all the frog.
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:54.320]  I went out of the pot, but I got to wake up everybody and get out of this paralysis for
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:56.600]  us to get the hell out of this pot, baby.
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:57.600]  Let's do it.
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:02.240]  There's going to be a social media summit here in DC tomorrow.
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:05.760]  Of course, info wars ground zero for the censorship.
[1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:09.960]  Alex Jones, patient zero for the censorship, doesn't even get an invite, but that's fine.
[1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:10.960]  We'll play the dark night.
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:14.400]  We hope that there's other people there that will bring us up, bring Alex Jones up, bring
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:19.680]  some of the other band names like Gavin McGinnis and Milo Unopolis and Laura Loomer up as well,
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:24.280]  and they won't be bullied by some of the conservatives that like to censor those voices as well.
[1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:25.280]  At the summit.
[1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:26.280]  But we'll see.
[1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:30.940]  I have a feeling this is just going to be throwing a dog a bone, patting him on the head
[1:05:30.940 --> 1:05:32.440]  and telling him to move on with his day.
[1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:37.040]  But hopefully maybe this spurs some action from Congress, from the president, from the
[1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:41.960]  White House to do something about the big tech censorship before the 2020 elections when
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:43.480]  it's going to be so key.
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:48.040]  It was info wars presence on social media that helped get Trump into the White House.
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:50.000]  That's why we are targeted.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.840]  So let's see what happens at the social media summit 2019.
[1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:54.840]  For info wars.com.
[1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:55.840]  This is Owen Schreuer.
[1:05:55.840 --> 1:06:04.760]  Big brother mainstream media government cover up.
[1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:06.480]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:11.440]  Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:12.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:24.440]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:47.040]  Did you know that in Charlottesville a year and a half ago, the Democratic Party and other
[1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:55.680]  groups put out ads and they hired what is called in Washington, Astro turf.
[1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:59.960]  And they hired people to dress like Nazis.
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:08.960]  That's why they actually wore costumes, khaki pants, white button-up shirts, tiki torches.
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:16.000]  And the five leaders of the group all formally worked for the Democratic Party within two
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:22.760]  years of them becoming Nazi leaders.
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:27.080]  And most of them were simply art department people and college students getting acting
[1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:35.520]  degrees, degrees in the arts, mainly gay men willing to do their part for the Democrats
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:44.120]  who came out and got together from all over the country, flew in and then had their march
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:49.360]  so that America would see marching Nazis.
[1:07:49.360 --> 1:08:03.000]  And I'll say it, Richard Spencer is a total fake and CNN puts him on as the Nazi leader.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:10.240]  He wears outfits like he's from 1938 Germany and it's all a giant theater art production.
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:19.240]  And I have the ads, online ad recruited Charlottesville activists for $25 an hour.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:22.080]  Actors and photographers wanted in Charlottesville.
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:28.440]  Now I exposed all this and so they said in the news that I said that woman didn't die
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:31.400]  of a heart attack or getting scared by the car.
[1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:32.400]  I never said that.
[1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:35.000]  And then I said that some photographer killed the woman.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.480]  I never said that.
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:42.280]  I'm being sued for that.
[1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:48.760]  The judge was letting it go forward but has allowed a very rare hearing because I guess
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:52.240]  the judges found out his law clerk just took whatever these people said and put it in there
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:53.360]  as his latest ruling.
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:56.720]  It's not what was said and not what was done.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:07.040]  The judge has a ruling that I said and the other defendants said, wait for it, that the
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:12.720]  people suing us had been neo-Nazis in Ukraine.
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:14.480]  No one ever said that.
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:17.040]  It's totally made up.
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.520]  But see these judges are some of them are old school.
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:23.520]  They don't understand how much the media lies.
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:28.400]  Neighborhood headlines that I lost to Sandy Hook lawsuit in AP.
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:32.800]  For a book I never wrote, for a suit that never happened.
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:37.080]  And AP told us they said go ahead and sue, we're not retracting it.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:38.080]  We are, don't worry.
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:39.960]  That's getting geared up.
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:43.680]  We don't want to sue them but I mean you got two folks when they're just saying flat
[1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:46.280]  out lies.
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:49.920]  And now reportedly the judge has actually been brought transcripts what was really said
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:57.040]  in the not too happy but there's this attitude in corporate media that they can just say
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:02.480]  whatever lie they want, put it in lawsuits and then just have everybody believe it and
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:06.880]  then convict me in the court of public opinion like Senator Blumenthal did in the Senate
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:07.880]  yesterday.
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:16.640]  And I didn't lead the show with that but Google testified saying M4 Wars and Alex Jones will
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:20.520]  soon be unsearchable.
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:27.760]  And now it's Bible verses are being banned as hateful for saying humanity is fallen and
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:28.760]  needs God.
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:34.360]  Well, that's hate speech to say that humanity has a problem and again, even if that wasn't
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:42.120]  true, which obviously it is, just look around you, even if that wasn't true, it's someone's
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:43.120]  right.
[1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:48.400]  It doesn't matter, you define it as hate speech but all the debates are that's not hate speech.
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:49.720]  The Bible is not hate speech.
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:54.760]  How about you don't have jurisdiction government and corporations and always to get involved
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:59.840]  in our communications and say well we've decided because we're a bunch of crazy wild
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:06.160]  university trained leftist that Bible verses are bad so we've decided it's hateful.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.520]  We're judge jury and executioner.
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:13.600]  That's a giant cult, period.
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:16.040]  So they're not coming for everyone.
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:17.760]  They've already come for you.
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:21.080]  They've got your children.
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:24.960]  First they banned criticizing vaccines and talking about what happened to you personally
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:28.520]  since when can consumers not say that on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook.
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:33.640]  Now major university and government studies are being buried and banned off of Google and
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:35.640]  Facebook.
[1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:43.280]  Public studies aren't allowed either to see once you banned one person's speech you better
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:49.080]  believe it'll be somebody else's speech tomorrow.
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:54.920]  And the worst part is once they've silenced you they can tell whatever lies they want.
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.320]  If they're successful shutting down talk radio like they want to and all these other things
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:04.920]  no one would be there to go to the facilities and show people that there's no concentration
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:13.040]  camps for the immigrant children that they're nicer than most of our public schools.
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:18.440]  Think about how dastardly that is because see I could easily just walk off and no longer
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:21.640]  be on air but they're going to come for me.
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:24.680]  It isn't just like they take your speech away.
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:32.040]  Then these criminals like Senator Blumenthal, this authoritarian monster, sits up there
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:35.600]  with a straight face and says he wants me eradicated.
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:42.480]  The other senator says for America to survive I must be silenced.
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:51.120]  I must be silenced because I said something mean about Sandy Hook which isn't even true
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.800]  but I have a right to say but they're lying.
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:00.560]  But they create a false narrative, Trump's hurting children in concentration camps, Alex
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:01.560]  is hurting.
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:07.280]  He's currently attacking the Sandy Hook families, protect us, he won't stop, he sends violent
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:08.280]  people.
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:12.640]  That's like saying he's sending people to our house right now, stop him.
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:16.080]  This isn't speech, this is violence, he's telling them and Google's like we're trying
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.280]  to stop him.
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:24.680]  It's all lies, he's bad, he's hurting us, these people know exactly what they're doing
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:34.200]  and his son with a former federal prosecutor runs their fake lawsuit against me and Blumenthal
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:46.840]  in the Senate in his chair says we want him off the air and his son runs the fake lawsuit
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:47.840]  and he admits it.
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:51.400]  I mean this guy lives because you're asleep.
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:55.720]  This whole world is that you won't stand up.
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.840]  He thinks you're an idiot, amazing.
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:08.120]  So here it is, Alex Jones in 2018, by 2019 they're saying you're allowed to prepare and
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:13.360]  organize violence against him and anyone else we designate and they've got that million
[1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:18.520]  person that wants to storm Area 51, there's no aliens in there, there's a bunch of secret
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:24.960]  aircraft and a giant toxic waste dump and a bunch of chemical weapons dumps, so a whole
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:28.560]  bunch of those sites.
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:33.960]  But if you storm that, you see, that's Facebook testing to see if it can organize that, Facebook
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:39.360]  was designed to overthrow countries and Facebook and Google and all of them still think they're
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:43.840]  going to beat Trump, they still think they're going to defeat America, they work with the
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:48.920]  chai comms and they're openly moving against everybody right now, so people ask me, how
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:55.360]  you taking it Alex, what's it like, I'm like a fighter pilot and a dogfight, I'm loving
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:01.200]  every minute of this, this is white knuckle exhilaration, how about you, how are you doing
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:05.520]  folks, it's all our freedoms, they're stealing, I'm in the front lines fighting as hard as
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:11.000]  I can, I feel pretty damn good, I'm worried about all those unborn and born babies, they're
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:14.760]  killing, I'm worried about the pedophilia everywhere and trying to sexualize children,
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:20.840]  I'm not doing good there, I'm pissed, see everybody thinks you get ahead by going along, that
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:25.800]  may have been the last 100 years of entropy, not anymore, we're at the final phases of
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:32.320]  this, you grovel to the system, you get your ass cooked and now they're banning, go read
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:37.040]  the bible verses they're banning, we'll cover some of those when we come back, but I'm going
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:43.160]  to play some of this Richard Spencer, because CNN says there's Nazis in concentration camps

[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:07.680]  ups and downs of Bitcoin.

[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:15.280]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:19.200]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:23.320]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:27.880]  Now the security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:33.920]  lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account

[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:53.440]  This offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before
[1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:58.560]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:06.240]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the continent, harness science,
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:14.440]  took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget that we are Americans
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:22.200]  and the future belongs to us.
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:27.200]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free.
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:34.480]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:42.880]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart and we are all made by the
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:45.160]  same Almighty God.
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:50.320]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, full power of the republic in the name of Jesus
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:58.800]  Christ, full power, damn the torpedoes, go straight at him.
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:02.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:07.480]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:12.400]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:13.400]  one another.
[1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:17.680]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:22.840]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:27.080]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:31.440]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  and supporting Infowars.
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:37.080]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:40.960]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:46.120]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:49.920]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:50.920]  to hold.
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:55.080]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[1:19:55.080 --> 1:20:19.080]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:31.660]  Okay, let's finish it up.
[1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:35.660]  Let me see that's the answer
[1:20:35.660 --> 1:20:40.660]  But nobody breathes for the dead inside
[1:20:40.660 --> 1:20:47.660]  And it's only Lord, only Lord, only Lord
[1:20:47.660 --> 1:21:00.660]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here broadcasting worldwide
[1:21:00.660 --> 1:21:09.660]  And central to all of this is the giant unmitigated hoax that we're putting children in concentration camps
[1:21:09.660 --> 1:21:13.660]  Well AP released three videos yesterday saying they're more like summer camps
[1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:18.660]  These are people coming here for free services, they're in the report saying we want free services
[1:21:18.660 --> 1:21:28.660]  Thank you America and AOC is like they drink from toilets and they're Nazi and they kill them
[1:21:28.660 --> 1:21:34.660]  And then Trump goes, you're a damn liar, oh you talk bad about me, you racist
[1:21:34.660 --> 1:21:38.660]  I mean it's just like shut up, God you're a monster
[1:21:38.660 --> 1:21:49.660]  Do what I say or world will end, just one whopper lie after whopper lie after whopper, whopper, whopper, whopper
[1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:51.660]  Here's the report
[1:21:51.660 --> 1:22:01.660]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly what they are
[1:22:01.660 --> 1:22:04.660]  Two pairs of bunk beds in each bedroom and the living room
[1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:05.660]  They are concentration camps
[1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:09.660]  HHS provides the teens with six hours daily classroom instruction
[1:22:09.660 --> 1:22:13.660]  Access to arts and crafts, three meals a day in snacks
[1:22:13.660 --> 1:22:17.660]  Access to call centers to reconnect with family, then legal services
[1:22:17.660 --> 1:22:24.660]  And as the contractor running the holding facility describes, most importantly they provide play time
[1:22:24.660 --> 1:22:35.660]  Is it schools sports day, summer camp, with freshly made beds, eat all you can buffet and the inevitable video games
[1:22:35.660 --> 1:22:48.660]  The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing
[1:22:48.660 --> 1:22:53.660]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants
[1:22:53.660 --> 1:23:06.660]  Some protesters replace three flags at the front of the facility with a Mexican flag and an upside down U.S. flag spray-painted with a bombish ice
[1:23:06.660 --> 1:23:15.660]  You are more concerned with a f***ing piece of cloth than people who are locked in cages to it right in front of you
[1:23:15.660 --> 1:23:18.660]  You know there's a flag in those two f***ings
[1:23:18.660 --> 1:23:29.660]  There were American flags hanging all over these facilities that children being separated from their parents in front of an American flag
[1:23:29.660 --> 1:23:34.660]  Mr. Speaker, we do have a crisis at our border. It is one of morality
[1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:40.660]  As we have seen this current strategy unfold intentional and cruelly created by the Trump administration
[1:23:40.660 --> 1:23:43.660]  If you're not happy here, then you can leave
[1:23:43.660 --> 1:23:48.660]  Why supremacist? Why supremacist?
[1:23:48.660 --> 1:23:57.660]  Why supremacist? Why supremacist? And again, you go to an election meeting, it looks like people escaped from a mental institution
[1:23:57.660 --> 1:24:02.660]  It's not like, oh we go and pick and choose and show a few people who are from a mental institution
[1:24:02.660 --> 1:24:10.660]  Go to any Democrat event, it looks like the most pathetic, stupid, lazy, low-energy people you've ever seen
[1:24:10.660 --> 1:24:17.660]  Until they get aroused like zombies that smell fresh brains and then they start hopping up and down
[1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:24.660]  And again, zombies are all allegories. Zombies are living but they're dead, they're dead but they're living
[1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:29.660]  And what do they want? They want brains. They don't have intellect
[1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:36.660]  So they want to destroy the people that have intellect, that have the spark of the creator
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:48.660]  Because to a demon-possessed method, the spark of God is very ugly and very painful
[1:24:48.660 --> 1:24:53.660]  Now, getting back to the big enchilada, I want to play this Richard Spencer clip
[1:24:53.660 --> 1:25:01.660]  I've watched Vice Documentaries, I've tracked this guy, his family, his parents are big leftist, big globalist
[1:25:01.660 --> 1:25:08.660]  All of his main henchmen are former Obama or Hillary workers
[1:25:08.660 --> 1:25:12.660]  One of them has been on the show, he was the leader of the Shardsville event
[1:25:12.660 --> 1:25:24.660]  He worked for Obama one year before he became the Nazi leader
[1:25:24.660 --> 1:25:29.660]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's come out over and over again at the Southern Parliament Law Center in the ADL
[1:25:29.660 --> 1:25:32.660]  So don't just infiltrate Nazi groups, they run them
[1:25:32.660 --> 1:25:36.660]  Elohim City outside Oklahoma City that planned the Oklahoma City bombing
[1:25:36.660 --> 1:25:40.660]  Him out in federal court, Carol Howell, FBI format exposed it
[1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:44.660]  Was being run by the Southern Parliament Law Center
[1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:49.660]  The whole thing. McVeigh tried to stop the attack, he was the Army Infiltrator
[1:25:49.660 --> 1:25:54.660]  The Army, of course, was watching what was happening, he was double-crossed, he was set up
[1:25:54.660 --> 1:25:59.660]  And I've interviewed his family, all his lawyers, all of them, it's a fact
[1:25:59.660 --> 1:26:06.660]  We have the witnesses that saw the feds placing the bombs in the building from the FBI, CIA and Deutsche Intelligence
[1:26:06.660 --> 1:26:12.660]  And now this guy is up here on television with CNN giving this platform
[1:26:12.660 --> 1:26:17.660]  You know, Paul watched the interview with Tommy Robinson and they said, oh, he's a Nazi, which isn't even true
[1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:20.660]  But Paul was in ban from Facebook, that was the reason given
[1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:26.660]  For even giving a platform to somebody, even if you disagree with them, but CNN, oh, they can give a platform to whoever they want, you see
[1:26:26.660 --> 1:26:28.660]  This is about them controlling the narrative
[1:26:28.660 --> 1:26:34.660]  So here they are giving Richard Spencer a platform to act like Trump's just pretending he's a Nazi like me
[1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:37.660]  He's not a real Nazi like me
[1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:42.660]  Essentially it normalizes hate and it makes it acceptable
[1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:47.660]  And it lowers our bar, our tolerance for what is allowed in our country
[1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:49.660]  And that is dangerous
[1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:51.660]  But here's a twist
[1:26:51.660 --> 1:26:54.660]  Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory
[1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:58.660]  White nationalist Richard Spencer who hailed Trump when he was first elected
[1:26:58.660 --> 1:26:59.660]  Hail victory
[1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:01.660]  Those who are turning on Trump
[1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:08.660]  Many white nationalists will eat up this red meat that Donald Trump is throwing out there
[1:27:08.660 --> 1:27:13.660]  I am not one of them, I recognize the con game that is going on
[1:27:13.660 --> 1:27:20.660]  They say Trump is all talk and no action on maintaining white dominance in America
[1:27:20.660 --> 1:27:23.660]  He gives us nothing, outside of racist tweets
[1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:28.660]  And by racist tweets, I mean tweets that are meaningless and cheap
[1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:34.660]  And express the kind of sentiments you might hear from your drunk uncle while he's watching Hannity
[1:27:34.660 --> 1:27:38.660]  If you're really listening to this guy, it's all dog whistles to the left
[1:27:38.660 --> 1:27:40.660]  He's a socialist
[1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:45.660]  CNN gives platform to alt-right white supremacist Richard Spencer in FullWars.com
[1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:53.660]  Oh look, exposed online ad recruited Charlottesville activists for $25 an hour to play the part of white supremacists
[1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:55.660]  Oh look, document cam shot please
[1:27:55.660 --> 1:27:57.660]  Look right here
[1:27:57.660 --> 1:28:02.660]  You can go higher crowds, there's dozens of companies, dozens of groups
[1:28:02.660 --> 1:28:03.660]  There's another one
[1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:09.660]  Why was this crowd hire company recruiting $25 an hour political activists in Charlottesville
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:11.660]  The week before
[1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:15.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's staged
[1:28:15.660 --> 1:28:17.660]  It's staged
[1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:22.660]  I've looked at the videos of Charlottesville very closely that marched a few nights before in the big melee the next day
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:32.660]  90% of the Nazis are theater major gay men from all over the United States
[1:28:32.660 --> 1:28:36.660]  Went and got paid to be actors, they all want to be on Netflix, they all want to be on TV
[1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:41.660]  And they all then prance around and talk about Nazis by posing as Nazis
[1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:44.660]  That's how the left wins, they stage things like Jesse Smallin
[1:28:44.660 --> 1:28:48.660]  I'm just telling you, you've got all these theater majors, the left recruited them and this is what they do now
[1:28:48.660 --> 1:28:55.660]  Giant hoaxes, fake narratives like kids in concentration camps, they're all a bunch of lying trash
[1:28:55.660 --> 1:29:01.660]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:06.660]  I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:11.660]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved

[1:30:57.660 --> 1:31:03.660]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history
[1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:09.660]  The globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war
[1:31:09.660 --> 1:31:13.660]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged
[1:31:13.660 --> 1:31:16.660]  The world is going to change
[1:31:16.660 --> 1:31:23.660]  And how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails
[1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:28.660]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant

[1:33:34.660 --> 1:33:38.660]  It's Alex Jones
[1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:44.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ben Garrison is our guest
[1:33:44.660 --> 1:33:51.660]  Then I'm going to up the phones up in the third hour and get to so much of this other incredible news that I haven't been mentioned yet
[1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:54.660]  I'm going to mention some of it here in just a moment
[1:33:54.660 --> 1:33:57.660]  But it's a paradox
[1:33:57.660 --> 1:34:01.660]  I learned three, four weeks ago they were going to have the summit
[1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:04.660]  Even before it had been announced by the White House
[1:34:04.660 --> 1:34:10.660]  The social media summit, the free speech, anti-censorship summit
[1:34:10.660 --> 1:34:13.660]  And then I never intended to be invited to it
[1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:18.660]  I've never been the guy that tries to join the clubs, I've never been the guy that tries to get into the fraternities
[1:34:18.660 --> 1:34:21.660]  I'm very bad if you have, that's good for business, whatever
[1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:24.660]  I've never been a joiner
[1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:28.660]  I'm here in Austin, Texas
[1:34:28.660 --> 1:34:32.660]  And I've been here since high school, born in Texas, family from Austin
[1:34:32.660 --> 1:34:35.660]  But I moved back to Austin in high school
[1:34:35.660 --> 1:34:41.660]  And it wasn't the big mega, mecca, hub, California escape valve that it is now
[1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:44.660]  It was just the middle of nowhere
[1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:46.660]  But that's kind of how I operate
[1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:49.660]  I'm not saying I made Austin this big mega hub
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:52.660]  I'm saying I like to create the trends
[1:34:52.660 --> 1:34:56.660]  And then I like to see everybody else then jump on board those trends
[1:34:56.660 --> 1:35:01.660]  And maybe like a jazz magician riff off those and make them even better
[1:35:01.660 --> 1:35:05.660]  And so I've always been kind of the guy out in the wilderness
[1:35:05.660 --> 1:35:10.660]  The mad prophet of the Tea Party, as Time Magazine said 15 years ago
[1:35:10.660 --> 1:35:12.660]  Or 12 years ago
[1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:15.660]  And so I didn't get butt hurt by not being invited
[1:35:15.660 --> 1:35:18.660]  I know that Paul Watson thought it was strange
[1:35:18.660 --> 1:35:20.660]  He wasn't invited because he's been so banned as well
[1:35:20.660 --> 1:35:21.660]  And it's about that
[1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.660]  Trump wanted to learn about it
[1:35:23.660 --> 1:35:28.660]  Or that people like Laura Loomer or Milo Unopolis or others weren't
[1:35:28.660 --> 1:35:30.660]  Or Gavin McGinnis
[1:35:30.660 --> 1:35:34.660]  But see, it would have been all about us instead of about social media and the censorship itself
[1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:36.660]  We've been there, so I got it
[1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:44.660]  But Ben Garrison is undoubtedly the most successful, most prolific
[1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:48.660]  Graphic political cartoonist in the world
[1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:52.660]  There's just absolutely no doubt
[1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:55.660]  And he was invited
[1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:59.660]  And what's wrong with this
[1:35:59.660 --> 1:36:02.660]  Is that once the media called him anti-Semitic
[1:36:02.660 --> 1:36:05.660]  Because he criticized George Soros
[1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:09.660]  Who just so happens to be Jewish
[1:36:09.660 --> 1:36:12.660]  He was commissioned to do that piece by the way by Mike Cernovich
[1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:14.660]  Once he did that
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:17.660]  It wasn't Trump did it, but it was his people dropping like a hot potato
[1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:21.660]  And that just shows how by increment
[1:36:21.660 --> 1:36:24.660]  Anytime the media criticizes, anytime the left criticizes
[1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:26.660]  We're all supposed to grovel in fear
[1:36:26.660 --> 1:36:29.660]  No, Trump's all about breaking the back of that
[1:36:29.660 --> 1:36:31.660]  Not giving in, not being politically correct
[1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:35.660]  Not watching what we say or some leftist will get mad
[1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:38.660]  And so of the whole conference, I'm very happy overall
[1:36:38.660 --> 1:36:39.660]  A lot of good ideas came out of it
[1:36:39.660 --> 1:36:40.660]  Trump committed to take action
[1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:42.660]  We're seeing some of that start
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:44.660]  But the only fly on the ointment
[1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:47.660]  Is that he invited Ben Garrison
[1:36:47.660 --> 1:36:50.660]  And then Ben Garrison who
[1:36:50.660 --> 1:36:53.660]  I'm proud to say I've influenced, he was just a mainline guy
[1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:55.660]  But still libertarian-esque
[1:36:55.660 --> 1:36:57.660]  And then he started putting out more anti-global stuff
[1:36:57.660 --> 1:36:59.660]  Over a decade ago and got even more popular
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:00.660]  And then he got censored
[1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:01.660]  Then he got banned
[1:37:01.660 --> 1:37:02.660]  And now he's more popular than ever
[1:37:02.660 --> 1:37:04.660]  I mean I see more Ben Garrison everywhere
[1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:08.660]  Than I've seen all the other top guys combined
[1:37:08.660 --> 1:37:11.660]  And so Trump needs Garrison
[1:37:11.660 --> 1:37:12.660]  His people need Garrison
[1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:13.660]  Trump needs us
[1:37:13.660 --> 1:37:15.660]  And Trump knows that and is very appreciative
[1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:16.660]  I'll guarantee you it's Trump said
[1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:17.660]  Bring Ben Garrison
[1:37:17.660 --> 1:37:20.660]  I know he loves Garrison stuff
[1:37:20.660 --> 1:37:22.660]  But Trump's instincts are our instincts
[1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:25.660]  They're not the Washington swamp he has to pull from
[1:37:25.660 --> 1:37:26.660]  In fact, can you guys print me the article
[1:37:26.660 --> 1:37:27.660]  From yesterday I didn't get to
[1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:30.660]  The Fox News 10 reporter
[1:37:30.660 --> 1:37:33.660]  She's Emmy award-winning, top ratings
[1:37:33.660 --> 1:37:35.660]  They told her on camera
[1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:36.660]  They'd know it was going out
[1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:37.660]  Somebody was taping it
[1:37:37.660 --> 1:37:39.660]  You can't have a parlor account
[1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:41.660]  Someone might call you right wing
[1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:43.660]  Oh, now it's don't be Alice Jones
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:44.660]  Don't be Ben Garrison
[1:37:44.660 --> 1:37:46.660]  Now it's don't be right wing
[1:37:46.660 --> 1:37:49.660]  And so everyone's just groveling
[1:37:49.660 --> 1:37:56.660]  And looking for new ways to please the system
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:37:58.660]  And there's no limit to it
[1:37:58.660 --> 1:38:02.660]  So when Facebook sort of banning
[1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:04.660]  Bible verses today
[1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:06.660]  The Christian groups are arguing
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:08.660]  Well, these aren't hateful passages
[1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:10.660]  Why do you give them the authority
[1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:12.660]  To say what an imaginary term hate speech is
[1:38:12.660 --> 1:38:14.660]  And then you go to them like they're the judge
[1:38:14.660 --> 1:38:17.660]  And say, okay, but I don't think this is hate speech
[1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:19.660]  No, they don't have the right to do that
[1:38:19.660 --> 1:38:21.660]  And of course it's not going to end anywhere
[1:38:21.660 --> 1:38:22.660]  Folks, it's going to continue
[1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:24.660]  So Ben Garrison joins us
[1:38:24.660 --> 1:38:27.660]  He's with G-R-R Graphics
[1:38:27.660 --> 1:38:29.660]  Graphics.com Bulldogs
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:31.660]  His symbol
[1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:33.660]  And he's coming on with us
[1:38:33.660 --> 1:38:35.660]  I mean, you've heard my take on this
[1:38:35.660 --> 1:38:37.660]  To me, the story isn't that they uninvited you
[1:38:37.660 --> 1:38:40.660]  It's in the general statement of
[1:38:40.660 --> 1:38:43.660]  We need to grow a backbone in this country
[1:38:43.660 --> 1:38:45.660]  And we need to speak our mind again
[1:38:45.660 --> 1:38:48.660]  That's the essence of being free
[1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:53.660]  Yeah, Alex, I understand what you said
[1:38:53.660 --> 1:38:54.660]  And where you're coming from
[1:38:54.660 --> 1:38:56.660]  But you should have been there
[1:38:56.660 --> 1:39:01.660]  I mean, you are the epitome of an influencer
[1:39:01.660 --> 1:39:03.660]  Who helped Trump get elected
[1:39:03.660 --> 1:39:06.660]  And then you sum up everything
[1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:08.660]  That they're trying to do to us
[1:39:08.660 --> 1:39:10.660]  They're trying to de-platform us, de-person us
[1:39:10.660 --> 1:39:12.660]  And that's all that stuff that's happening
[1:39:12.660 --> 1:39:14.660]  You should have been there
[1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:15.660]  And so should have...
[1:39:15.660 --> 1:39:17.660]  The other ones that you mentioned
[1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:19.660]  I should have been there
[1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:23.660]  But look, I was so happy to be invited
[1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:25.660]  I didn't say anything for about a week
[1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:26.660]  But I was bursting
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:28.660]  I want to tell our supporters
[1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:30.660]  That I was so happy to be going
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:33.660]  I was going to give Trump a proof of our coffee table book
[1:39:33.660 --> 1:39:35.660]  Which came out so beautiful
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:37.660]  I was going to present it to him somehow
[1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:38.660]  And I just couldn't wait to go
[1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:40.660]  I was like, you know, I was really excited
[1:39:40.660 --> 1:39:42.660]  It was surreal and I couldn't wait to go
[1:39:42.660 --> 1:39:46.660]  But I should have kept my mouth shut
[1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:48.660]  I'm not good at playing politics, I guess
[1:39:48.660 --> 1:39:50.660]  Even though I'm a political cartoonist
[1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:51.660]  And I didn't...
[1:39:51.660 --> 1:39:54.660]  I don't consider myself to be a racist, bigot
[1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:56.660]  Anti-Semitic, blah, blah, blah, blah
[1:39:56.660 --> 1:39:57.660]  Whatever they want to call me
[1:39:57.660 --> 1:39:59.660]  Because I don't identify as any of that
[1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:02.660]  I didn't expect to be called all this
[1:40:02.660 --> 1:40:06.660]  But all these people that sort of make these decisions
[1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:09.660]  For us and tell us what we can and cannot say
[1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:11.660]  The line-drawers, they draw lines in and say
[1:40:11.660 --> 1:40:13.660]  Well, you can't go over that line
[1:40:13.660 --> 1:40:14.660]  You can't mention the Federal Reserve
[1:40:14.660 --> 1:40:16.660]  Because you'll be anti-Semitic
[1:40:16.660 --> 1:40:18.660]  And we'll say that you hate Jews
[1:40:18.660 --> 1:40:20.660]  Or you can't cross over this line
[1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:24.660]  Or we'll say that you're an outspoken racist
[1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:26.660]  What the Huffington Post called me out of the blue
[1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:28.660]  An outspoken racist
[1:40:28.660 --> 1:40:30.660]  I don't know where this is coming from
[1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:31.660]  But they all piled on me
[1:40:31.660 --> 1:40:32.660]  You know how it goes
[1:40:32.660 --> 1:40:34.660]  They start clutching their pearls
[1:40:34.660 --> 1:40:36.660]  They play the ain't it awful game
[1:40:36.660 --> 1:40:39.660]  They blow it up into a giant complegation
[1:40:39.660 --> 1:40:41.660]  I was kind of surprised they used me
[1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:43.660]  You know, I'm still kind of...
[1:40:43.660 --> 1:40:45.660]  I consider myself just kind of like...
[1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:47.660]  Well, Ben, they know you're super effective
[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:49.660]  And they also think you're stupid
[1:40:49.660 --> 1:40:51.660]  Because I learned from insiders
[1:40:51.660 --> 1:40:53.660]  They thought that when they try to drive a wedge between me and Trump
[1:40:53.660 --> 1:40:55.660]  I would get mad at Trump
[1:40:55.660 --> 1:40:58.660]  And of course, we're not like little babies
[1:40:58.660 --> 1:41:00.660]  That take our marbles and go home
[1:41:00.660 --> 1:41:03.660]  But the left's trying to take Trump's biggest supporters
[1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:05.660]  And make us feel spurned
[1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:08.660]  So that we don't support Trump
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:10.660]  I still support the president
[1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:14.660]  And I said that when I, you know, announced what was going on
[1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:16.660]  And I still went to Washington, D.C.
[1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:17.660]  It was too late to cancel the tickets
[1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:19.660]  I said, heck with it, I'll go
[1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:22.660]  And one of the invitees
[1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:26.660]  Was kind enough to invite me to the after party
[1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:28.660]  At the Trump International Hotel where I stay
[1:41:28.660 --> 1:41:30.660]  And it was a really nice experience
[1:41:30.660 --> 1:41:32.660]  And let me tell you, Alex
[1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:36.660]  I mean, I saw your guy Harrison Smith there
[1:41:36.660 --> 1:41:39.660]  Oh, that guy's a really sharp young man
[1:41:39.660 --> 1:41:41.660]  Oh, absolutely, Harrison's awesome
[1:41:41.660 --> 1:41:42.660]  We also had...
[1:41:42.660 --> 1:41:44.660]  I was talking to these guys
[1:41:44.660 --> 1:41:46.660]  And they're young
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:48.660]  I mean, maybe that I'm old
[1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:50.660]  And I see everybody in a different light
[1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:53.660]  But these guys have so much potential
[1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:55.660]  Some of them, they're like very smart
[1:41:55.660 --> 1:41:57.660]  They're articulate, well spoken
[1:41:57.660 --> 1:41:58.660]  And they're handsome
[1:41:58.660 --> 1:41:59.660]  I mean, I looked at them
[1:41:59.660 --> 1:42:00.660]  I thought they were movie stars
[1:42:00.660 --> 1:42:02.660]  I mean, here's a Brad, guy looks like Brad Pitt
[1:42:02.660 --> 1:42:05.660]  There's a guy there that looks exactly like Sammy Davis Jr
[1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:08.660]  There's another guy I met that looked like Frank Sinatra
[1:42:08.660 --> 1:42:09.660]  I was thinking to myself
[1:42:09.660 --> 1:42:12.660]  Well, these guys can have a mega rat pack going here
[1:42:12.660 --> 1:42:15.660]  But I kind of walked away out of that
[1:42:15.660 --> 1:42:19.660]  With some hope because these young people
[1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:23.660]  Can really help influence and turn the tide
[1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:24.660]  I mean, I just want...
[1:42:24.660 --> 1:42:26.660]  Because I'm kind of a cynical guy
[1:42:26.660 --> 1:42:27.660]  But I mean, I met one young lady
[1:42:27.660 --> 1:42:28.660]  She must have been in her 20s
[1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:30.660]  And boy, this gal
[1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:32.660]  I mean, she's going to start a YouTube channel
[1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:35.660]  And I could see a star in the making
[1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:36.660]  Oh, absolutely
[1:42:36.660 --> 1:42:37.660]  What's happening is
[1:42:37.660 --> 1:42:38.660]  The more they censor, more talent
[1:42:38.660 --> 1:42:40.660]  Just pours in to fill the ranks
[1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:43.660]  We've got a lot of battlefield promotions going on here
[1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:44.660]  But when I come back
[1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:46.660]  I want to quantify where I was going
[1:42:46.660 --> 1:42:47.660]  Because I don't think I articulated it right
[1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:49.660]  I want to explain something critical
[1:42:49.660 --> 1:42:51.660]  You brought the game, Ben
[1:42:51.660 --> 1:42:52.660]  I brought the game
[1:42:52.660 --> 1:42:55.660]  We already are in the White House every day
[1:42:55.660 --> 1:43:24.660]  Our Powerful Line of Fluoride Free Products
[1:43:24.660 --> 1:43:26.660]  Available in two refreshing flavors
[1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:27.660]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor

[1:43:29.660 --> 1:43:31.660]  Or try our bubblegum flavor
[1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:33.660]  Super Blue Immune Gargle is the only option

[1:43:52.660 --> 1:43:55.660]  And get our line of Super Blue products today
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:25.660]  The equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[1:44:25.660 --> 1:44:26.660]  Who ran American politics
[1:44:26.660 --> 1:44:27.660]  And ran American economy
[1:44:27.660 --> 1:44:28.660]  Almost into the ground
[1:44:28.660 --> 1:44:30.660]  Until we were able to recover after the Great Depression
[1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:32.660]  The Infowars audience is the fuel
[1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:34.660]  That flames the light of liberty
[1:44:34.660 --> 1:44:35.660]  Across the world
[1:44:35.660 --> 1:44:38.660]  To make real the actions of independent free speech
[1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:40.660]  To make real the original promise
[1:44:40.660 --> 1:44:41.660]  Of an independent free press
[1:44:41.660 --> 1:44:43.660]  Real collusion is big tech and big media
[1:44:43.660 --> 1:44:45.660]  Manipulating and working with each other
[1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:47.660]  To try to meddle with elections
[1:44:47.660 --> 1:44:48.660]  To try to shake people's thoughts
[1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:50.660]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[1:44:50.660 --> 1:44:51.660]  What's not happening?
[1:44:51.660 --> 1:44:52.660]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting
[1:44:52.660 --> 1:44:54.660]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw
[1:44:54.660 --> 1:44:56.660]  Even it is what you just saw
[1:44:58.660 --> 1:45:00.660]  I talk about this on the air
[1:45:00.660 --> 1:45:01.660]  And I know it sinks into people
[1:45:01.660 --> 1:45:03.660]  But I've decided that we're going to kind of
[1:45:03.660 --> 1:45:04.660]  Reboot all our supplements
[1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:06.660]  In that if you go back five, six years ago
[1:45:06.660 --> 1:45:07.660]  Before all the censorship and attacks
[1:45:07.660 --> 1:45:09.660]  And fake lawsuits and the rest of it
[1:45:09.660 --> 1:45:11.660]  I would talk about how great the products are
[1:45:11.660 --> 1:45:12.660]  And how they were the best
[1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:13.660]  And why they were
[1:45:13.660 --> 1:45:14.660]  And I'd have doctors on an expert
[1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:15.660]  To explain why they were so good
[1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:16.660]  And instead the last few years
[1:45:16.660 --> 1:45:18.660]  I'm like, hey, we need to really support us
[1:45:18.660 --> 1:45:19.660]  Or they'll shut us down
[1:45:19.660 --> 1:45:20.660]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:21.660]  Because they know how great they are
[1:45:21.660 --> 1:45:22.660]  And how wonderful they were
[1:45:22.660 --> 1:45:24.660]  And the left always has headlines everywhere
[1:45:24.660 --> 1:45:27.660]  Jones sells unapproved supplements
[1:45:27.660 --> 1:45:28.660]  And he claims they're supplements
[1:45:28.660 --> 1:45:31.660]  No, under federal law since 1996
[1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:33.660]  You can't say that a supplement
[1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:34.660]  Has been through the FDA
[1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:35.660]  Because they have no jurisdiction
[1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:36.660]  And won't look at it
[1:45:36.660 --> 1:45:37.660]  But then they say
[1:45:37.660 --> 1:45:39.660]  You've got to say it's not approved by them
[1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:40.660]  And all drugs are
[1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:42.660]  Is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature
[1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:44.660]  And manipulate it and do different things
[1:45:44.660 --> 1:45:45.660]  And a lot of drugs work great
[1:45:45.660 --> 1:45:46.660]  They have side effects
[1:45:46.660 --> 1:45:47.660]  Not with mother nature
[1:45:47.660 --> 1:45:49.660]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing
[1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:51.660]  About God's medicine chest
[1:45:51.660 --> 1:45:53.660]  InfowarsStore.com or
[1:45:53.660 --> 1:45:56.660]  888-253-3139
[1:45:59.660 --> 1:46:00.660]  Infowars
[1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:03.660]  The most banned network in the world
[1:46:03.660 --> 1:46:04.660]  Viewers and listeners
[1:46:04.660 --> 1:46:06.660]  I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you
[1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:08.660]  And we're under unprecedented
[1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:09.660]  Evil attacks as you've seen
[1:46:09.660 --> 1:46:11.660]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here
[1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:12.660]  From the bottom of my heart
[1:46:12.660 --> 1:46:14.660]  To tell you how much it means to me
[1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:16.660]  That when you saw those lies
[1:46:16.660 --> 1:46:17.660]  Against us last week
[1:46:17.660 --> 1:46:19.660]  The worst things you can say about people
[1:46:19.660 --> 1:46:20.660]  That you knew they were liars
[1:46:20.660 --> 1:46:21.660]  You went and looked it up
[1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:22.660]  And found out the truth
[1:46:22.660 --> 1:46:23.660]  And so I feel very strong
[1:46:23.660 --> 1:46:25.660]  And I feel God's hand on my shoulder
[1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:27.660]  And I feel your love in my heart
[1:46:27.660 --> 1:46:28.660]  And I want you to know that love
[1:46:28.660 --> 1:46:29.660]  Is right back at you
[1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:30.660]  And I want to thank you
[1:46:30.660 --> 1:46:31.660]  For all you've done
[1:46:31.660 --> 1:46:32.660]  With your word of mouth
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:33.660]  And your prayers
[1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:34.660]  And your financial support
[1:46:34.660 --> 1:46:36.660]  Because I'm committed to fight to the end
[1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:37.660]  But I want to win
[1:46:37.660 --> 1:46:38.660]  And without you
[1:46:38.660 --> 1:46:39.660]  I'm going to be destroyed
[1:46:39.660 --> 1:46:40.660]  And it's not going to be fun
[1:46:40.660 --> 1:46:41.660]  But that's not what's important
[1:46:41.660 --> 1:46:43.660]  The enemy could win
[1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:45.660]  We're a key chess piece in this fight
[1:46:45.660 --> 1:46:46.660]  You're being used by God
[1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:47.660]  You're being used by God
[1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:48.660]  This is providence
[1:46:48.660 --> 1:46:49.660]  So I salute you
[1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:50.660]  And I thank you for all you've done
[1:46:50.660 --> 1:47:16.660]  From the bottom of my heart
[1:47:20.660 --> 1:47:24.660]  Welcome back Alex Jones here
[1:47:24.660 --> 1:47:25.660]  Broadcasting the World Wide
[1:47:25.660 --> 1:47:30.660]  We have the undisputed top political graphics cartoonist
[1:47:30.660 --> 1:47:32.660]  Local cartoonist
[1:47:32.660 --> 1:47:33.660]  With us Ben Garrison
[1:47:33.660 --> 1:47:36.660]  And he's a humble guy
[1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.660]  Out in the mountains of the west
[1:47:38.660 --> 1:47:39.660]  With his wife
[1:47:39.660 --> 1:47:40.660]  He's come to town
[1:47:40.660 --> 1:47:41.660]  Met his wife
[1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:42.660]  She's a great lady
[1:47:42.660 --> 1:47:45.660]  And he's just hurt
[1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:46.660]  That they're calling him a Nazi
[1:47:46.660 --> 1:47:47.660]  And all this
[1:47:47.660 --> 1:47:48.660]  Let's see
[1:47:48.660 --> 1:47:49.660]  We always are on the defense
[1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:51.660]  And I've been the same
[1:47:51.660 --> 1:47:53.660]  But everybody knows their line
[1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:55.660]  About concentration camps
[1:47:55.660 --> 1:47:57.660]  And little kids drinking out of toilets
[1:47:57.660 --> 1:47:58.660]  And Trump's killing them
[1:47:58.660 --> 1:47:59.660]  And all this crap
[1:47:59.660 --> 1:48:00.660]  And the kids are being separated
[1:48:00.660 --> 1:48:01.660]  From their parents
[1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:03.660]  Yeah, when there aren't any parents with them
[1:48:03.660 --> 1:48:05.660]  And fake time magazine covers
[1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:07.660]  A little crying Hispanic girls
[1:48:07.660 --> 1:48:09.660]  This is sick and evil
[1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:10.660]  But everybody always defends themselves
[1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:11.660]  And goes
[1:48:11.660 --> 1:48:12.660]  Oh, I'm not these things
[1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:13.660]  Instead of going
[1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:15.660]  You're a pack of lying scum
[1:48:15.660 --> 1:48:16.660]  You're the enemy of the people
[1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:17.660]  You're fake news
[1:48:17.660 --> 1:48:19.660]  Trump does it, I do it
[1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:22.660]  And Ben does it in his cartoons
[1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:25.660]  But we have to stop caring, folks
[1:48:25.660 --> 1:48:27.660]  Because I don't think anybody's been
[1:48:27.660 --> 1:48:29.660]  Lied about more than me
[1:48:29.660 --> 1:48:30.660]  Except Trump
[1:48:30.660 --> 1:48:32.660]  And you just learn
[1:48:32.660 --> 1:48:33.660]  That it's a fraud
[1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:34.660]  Take this article, f them
[1:48:34.660 --> 1:48:37.660]  Fox 10 host responds to bosses
[1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:39.660]  Who asked her to hide
[1:48:39.660 --> 1:48:40.660]  Her right-wing views
[1:48:40.660 --> 1:48:41.660]  Somebody
[1:48:41.660 --> 1:48:42.660]  Sort of hearing this conversation
[1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:43.660]  Probably a leftist
[1:48:43.660 --> 1:48:45.660]  Was like, ooh, ah
[1:48:45.660 --> 1:48:47.660]  Ooh, she's talking about how
[1:48:47.660 --> 1:48:48.660]  She's allowed to have a parlor site
[1:48:48.660 --> 1:48:50.660]  Parlor is just an alternative to Facebook
[1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:51.660]  It's got liberals, conservatives
[1:48:51.660 --> 1:48:52.660]  You name it on it
[1:48:52.660 --> 1:48:55.660]  The president is getting ready to promote it
[1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:57.660]  And so here you've got the main anchor
[1:48:57.660 --> 1:48:58.660]  Talking to her
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:48:59.660]  She's the other big anchor
[1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:01.660]  She's award-winning
[1:49:01.660 --> 1:49:02.660]  National TV level
[1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:04.660]  Emmy award-winning
[1:49:04.660 --> 1:49:06.660]  And he's saying, you better watch out
[1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:09.660]  I mean, somebody might complain
[1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:11.660]  She goes, what, some local leftist paper?
[1:49:11.660 --> 1:49:13.660]  So what?
[1:49:13.660 --> 1:49:14.660]  Oh, well, we don't want you on there
[1:49:14.660 --> 1:49:15.660]  Getting a national audience
[1:49:15.660 --> 1:49:16.660]  This woman puts out good reports
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:17.660]  I went and watched some of them
[1:49:17.660 --> 1:49:18.660]  I've seen some before
[1:49:18.660 --> 1:49:20.660]  She starts putting them on Instagram
[1:49:20.660 --> 1:49:22.660]  She starts putting them on parlor
[1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:24.660]  She'll get millions
[1:49:24.660 --> 1:49:26.660]  Oh, no, someone might get upset
[1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:28.660]  Someone, oh, oh my gosh
[1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:29.660]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[1:49:29.660 --> 1:49:30.660]  Someone
[1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:33.660]  So again, first it's the Nazis
[1:49:33.660 --> 1:49:34.660]  Well, I'll take their rights away
[1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:35.660]  And then it's Alex Jones
[1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:36.660]  And then it's Ben Garrison
[1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:37.660]  And then it's everybody
[1:49:37.660 --> 1:49:39.660]  Now it's Bible verses
[1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:40.660]  Facebook's taking down
[1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:42.660]  Big article on M4s.com
[1:49:42.660 --> 1:49:43.660]  There's no end
[1:49:43.660 --> 1:49:46.660]  And I love how she just says F them
[1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:47.660]  I'm doing it
[1:49:47.660 --> 1:49:49.660]  I'm reaching people on there
[1:49:49.660 --> 1:49:51.660]  I'm a human being
[1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:53.660]  Well, somebody might say
[1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:54.660]  You're a right-wing extremist
[1:49:54.660 --> 1:49:56.660]  Here it is
[1:49:56.660 --> 1:49:58.660]  I think they just think it's been branded
[1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:00.660]  As a far-right kind of place
[1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:01.660]  Jesus
[1:50:01.660 --> 1:50:03.660]  So they don't want you tied in
[1:50:03.660 --> 1:50:04.660]  Anything like that
[1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:05.660]  Where you're going to get blowback
[1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:07.660]  From the new times
[1:50:07.660 --> 1:50:09.660]  Or whoever it is
[1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:11.660]  I don't want your old dopes
[1:50:11.660 --> 1:50:13.660]  That's a right for selling marijuana
[1:50:13.660 --> 1:50:14.660]  I know, but you've got to
[1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:15.660]  Then they're in a position
[1:50:15.660 --> 1:50:16.660]  Where they've got to explain it
[1:50:16.660 --> 1:50:19.660]  Or you've got to explain it
[1:50:19.660 --> 1:50:22.660]  I'm reaching people
[1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:23.660]  So they're about to go live
[1:50:23.660 --> 1:50:24.660]  She's standing next to this
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:26.660]  Solus Peacock
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:27.660]  Who's looking at himself
[1:50:27.660 --> 1:50:28.660]  And all getting ready
[1:50:28.660 --> 1:50:30.660]  To go on and act powerful
[1:50:30.660 --> 1:50:31.660]  And he's lecturing her
[1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:32.660]  About the manager
[1:50:32.660 --> 1:50:33.660]  Wanted me to say this to you
[1:50:33.660 --> 1:50:35.660]  Well, if someone complains
[1:50:35.660 --> 1:50:37.660]  He'll have to explain it
[1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:38.660]  Just have no soul
[1:50:38.660 --> 1:50:39.660]  Read off a teleprompter
[1:50:39.660 --> 1:50:42.660]  Don't have your own parlor site
[1:50:42.660 --> 1:50:44.660]  And this happens everywhere
[1:50:44.660 --> 1:50:45.660]  Death by a billion cuts
[1:50:45.660 --> 1:50:47.660]  Oh, you might not say this
[1:50:47.660 --> 1:50:48.660]  Oh, you might not say that
[1:50:48.660 --> 1:50:49.660]  And then it's less and less
[1:50:49.660 --> 1:50:52.660]  We can say, oh, better not
[1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:53.660]  Share Bible verses
[1:50:53.660 --> 1:50:54.660]  So the average church down
[1:50:54.660 --> 1:50:57.660]  Won't even have Bible verses
[1:50:57.660 --> 1:50:58.660]  Oh, if I want to take that
[1:50:58.660 --> 1:51:00.660]  Cross down in the first Methodist
[1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:01.660]  You know here
[1:51:01.660 --> 1:51:02.660]  And somebody might be offended
[1:51:02.660 --> 1:51:05.660]  Okay, we'll take that cross down
[1:51:05.660 --> 1:51:08.660]  We better have an LGBT preacher
[1:51:08.660 --> 1:51:09.660]  Well, that's not enough
[1:51:09.660 --> 1:51:10.660]  We have a gay preacher
[1:51:10.660 --> 1:51:13.660]  We better have a lesbian preacher
[1:51:13.660 --> 1:51:15.660]  And it's just all taking
[1:51:15.660 --> 1:51:16.660]  And that's the new ruling class
[1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.660]  You see, leftist
[1:51:18.660 --> 1:51:21.660]  Because of where they stick their
[1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:22.660]  Sexual organs
[1:51:22.660 --> 1:51:25.660]  They are better
[1:51:25.660 --> 1:51:26.660]  And you look at this
[1:51:26.660 --> 1:51:27.660]  Solus Peacock
[1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:29.660]  He's just telling her, no
[1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:31.660]  You need to grovel
[1:51:31.660 --> 1:51:32.660]  You need to
[1:51:32.660 --> 1:51:33.660]  America didn't get
[1:51:33.660 --> 1:51:37.660]  Built groveling, little man
[1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:38.660]  Ben Garrison
[1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:39.660]  What I'm saying is
[1:51:39.660 --> 1:51:43.660]  We were the launch pad for Trump
[1:51:43.660 --> 1:51:45.660]  We are already arrived
[1:51:45.660 --> 1:51:46.660]  Wherever you're out in Montana
[1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:48.660]  Wyoming, I'm here in Austin, Texas
[1:51:48.660 --> 1:51:49.660]  We are here
[1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:51.660]  We don't want to be in the club
[1:51:51.660 --> 1:51:53.660]  You're summoned to the White House
[1:51:53.660 --> 1:51:54.660]  Because you're important
[1:51:54.660 --> 1:51:55.660]  And because Trump must
[1:51:55.660 --> 1:51:56.660]  Get ready to take action
[1:51:56.660 --> 1:51:57.660]  And because you were so important
[1:51:57.660 --> 1:51:58.660]  They didn't want you there
[1:51:58.660 --> 1:52:00.660]  Because when you're really important
[1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:01.660]  You can't be there
[1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:03.660]  Because Washington fears you
[1:52:03.660 --> 1:52:05.660]  And they fear you having that access
[1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:06.660]  But my friend
[1:52:06.660 --> 1:52:07.660]  You have the access
[1:52:07.660 --> 1:52:08.660]  Because we the people
[1:52:08.660 --> 1:52:10.660]  Share your cartoons
[1:52:10.660 --> 1:52:11.660]  We the people share
[1:52:11.660 --> 1:52:13.660]  The Candace Owens video she did
[1:52:13.660 --> 1:52:14.660]  That she asked folks to get out
[1:52:14.660 --> 1:52:16.660]  But we added video proof
[1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:17.660]  From inside the facilities
[1:52:17.660 --> 1:52:19.660]  Backing up what she said
[1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:22.660]  Exclusively, the listeners
[1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:23.660]  They are America
[1:52:23.660 --> 1:52:24.660]  They are the world
[1:52:24.660 --> 1:52:25.660]  So they can be listening in Africa
[1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:26.660]  Or Asia
[1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:27.660]  They can spread this video
[1:52:27.660 --> 1:52:29.660]  I'm just saying, Ben
[1:52:29.660 --> 1:52:30.660]  I'm not lecturing you
[1:52:30.660 --> 1:52:31.660]  You're older than I am
[1:52:31.660 --> 1:52:32.660]  But I've just been
[1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:33.660]  You understand, like
[1:52:33.660 --> 1:52:35.660]  It's an honor that they kept you
[1:52:35.660 --> 1:52:36.660]  From going
[1:52:36.660 --> 1:52:37.660]  I'm not saying it's good
[1:52:37.660 --> 1:52:38.660]  But what do you expect?
[1:52:38.660 --> 1:52:39.660]  Don't you think the enemy
[1:52:39.660 --> 1:52:41.660]  In a war would want to keep
[1:52:41.660 --> 1:52:44.660]  Don't you think the three-headed dragon
[1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:46.660]  In the latest Godzilla movie
[1:52:46.660 --> 1:52:47.660]  Whatever it's named
[1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:48.660]  Would it like to keep
[1:52:48.660 --> 1:52:49.660]  Godzilla off the field?
[1:52:49.660 --> 1:52:52.660]  I mean, you understand that, right?
[1:52:52.660 --> 1:52:53.660]  Well, yeah
[1:52:53.660 --> 1:52:55.660]  Well, it boils down to the fact
[1:52:55.660 --> 1:52:56.660]  That these control freaks
[1:52:56.660 --> 1:52:58.660]  These authoritarian control freaks
[1:52:58.660 --> 1:52:59.660]  People like Hillary
[1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:00.660]  You remember
[1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:02.660]  The internet needs an editor
[1:53:02.660 --> 1:53:03.660]  Well, who's going to be the editor?
[1:53:03.660 --> 1:53:05.660]  Well, it's going to be people like
[1:53:05.660 --> 1:53:06.660]  Hillary Clinton
[1:53:06.660 --> 1:53:07.660]  Or Barack Obama saying
[1:53:07.660 --> 1:53:09.660]  Oh, this internet is
[1:53:09.660 --> 1:53:10.660]  It's not controlled enough
[1:53:10.660 --> 1:53:12.660]  It's the Wild West
[1:53:12.660 --> 1:53:13.660]  Well, yeah, we like that
[1:53:13.660 --> 1:53:15.660]  But no, he wants the sheriff
[1:53:15.660 --> 1:53:16.660]  To come in town
[1:53:16.660 --> 1:53:17.660]  And clean the town up
[1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:19.660]  And, of course, he's going to be the sheriff
[1:53:19.660 --> 1:53:20.660]  And he's going to tell you
[1:53:20.660 --> 1:53:21.660]  What you can say
[1:53:21.660 --> 1:53:22.660]  And what you can't say
[1:53:22.660 --> 1:53:24.660]  He's going to keep everybody channeled
[1:53:24.660 --> 1:53:26.660]  Into a narrow channel
[1:53:26.660 --> 1:53:28.660]  What's acceptable subjects
[1:53:28.660 --> 1:53:29.660]  For conversation
[1:53:29.660 --> 1:53:32.660]  And if you happen to jump out of that channel
[1:53:32.660 --> 1:53:33.660]  Then you get noticed
[1:53:33.660 --> 1:53:34.660]  And they come at you with the whips
[1:53:34.660 --> 1:53:37.660]  And the whips are the name calling
[1:53:37.660 --> 1:53:39.660]  To get you back in line
[1:53:39.660 --> 1:53:42.660]  And that's sort of what they did to me
[1:53:42.660 --> 1:53:43.660]  And on a mass scale
[1:53:43.660 --> 1:53:45.660]  I mean, I was just kind of amazed
[1:53:45.660 --> 1:53:47.660]  It's like, wow, you know
[1:53:47.660 --> 1:53:50.660]  I'm getting vilified all over the world
[1:53:50.660 --> 1:53:53.660]  And it's all a lie
[1:53:53.660 --> 1:53:55.660]  And I typed in a couple key words
[1:53:55.660 --> 1:53:56.660]  That they all used
[1:53:56.660 --> 1:53:58.660]  And it just went on and on
[1:53:58.660 --> 1:54:00.660]  All of them are like lockstep
[1:54:00.660 --> 1:54:01.660]  With somebody handing them a script
[1:54:01.660 --> 1:54:02.660]  And this is what you say
[1:54:02.660 --> 1:54:04.660]  He's blatantly this
[1:54:04.660 --> 1:54:06.660]  And he's a racist that
[1:54:06.660 --> 1:54:07.660]  And it's like, God
[1:54:07.660 --> 1:54:09.660]  This is journalism nowadays
[1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:12.660]  Well, you know, here's the deal
[1:54:12.660 --> 1:54:14.660]  They're really trying to make
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:16.660]  Not just their free speech rights
[1:54:16.660 --> 1:54:17.660]  But all of our rights
[1:54:17.660 --> 1:54:18.660]  What they want to do
[1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:21.660]  Is they want to make them all relative
[1:54:21.660 --> 1:54:23.660]  Because, you know, how relativistic they are
[1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:25.660]  So they make our rights relative
[1:54:25.660 --> 1:54:28.660]  And they want to convert them into privileges
[1:54:28.660 --> 1:54:31.660]  And once they get a control over what
[1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:32.660]  What those privileges are
[1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:34.660]  Then those privileges go away
[1:54:34.660 --> 1:54:36.660]  It's just like Cory Booker came out
[1:54:36.660 --> 1:54:38.660]  And said he wanted
[1:54:38.660 --> 1:54:40.660]  Oh, we just want reasonable gun control
[1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:41.660]  They need to get a license
[1:54:41.660 --> 1:54:42.660]  And I screamed at him
[1:54:42.660 --> 1:54:45.660]  I said, the second amendment is my license
[1:54:45.660 --> 1:54:46.660]  I don't need your license
[1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:48.660]  Because as soon as you start controlling the licenses
[1:54:48.660 --> 1:54:50.660]  You're not going to be able to get a license
[1:54:50.660 --> 1:54:51.660]  It's the same thing with free speech
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:53.660]  Once we let them control what we can say
[1:54:53.660 --> 1:54:55.660]  Or not say
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:57.660]  It's not going to lead to a good end
[1:54:57.660 --> 1:55:00.660]  I mean, this is where we really have to start
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:02.660]  Pushing back against these tyrants
[1:55:02.660 --> 1:55:05.660]  Because once they get total control of the narrative
[1:55:05.660 --> 1:55:09.660]  Then they're going to get control of thought itself
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:12.660]  And you just said it
[1:55:12.660 --> 1:55:15.660]  If you watch what the Democrats are saying
[1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:17.660]  In the Senate, in the House
[1:55:17.660 --> 1:55:19.660]  They're saying
[1:55:19.660 --> 1:55:20.660]  The buzzer's up
[1:55:20.660 --> 1:55:21.660]  That's what William and Paul said
[1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:23.660]  We're going to regulate the internet now
[1:55:23.660 --> 1:55:25.660]  But the Democrats are going to decide how it's done
[1:55:25.660 --> 1:55:26.660]  We're going to censor everybody
[1:55:26.660 --> 1:55:28.660]  They're going to use that as the reform
[1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:31.660]  To intensify the crisis they've already created
[1:55:31.660 --> 1:55:34.660]  So there's no choice that the UN
[1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:37.660]  And the EU and the Chai comms are already regulating it
[1:55:37.660 --> 1:55:39.660]  So Congress must act now
[1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:40.660]  Because they've created a vacuum
[1:55:40.660 --> 1:55:43.660]  Exactly what I've been saying for two years
[1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:46.660]  Is now understood by the White House and others
[1:55:46.660 --> 1:55:49.660]  And so we've really reached this amazing flash point
[1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:51.660]  Where William and Paul said
[1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:54.660]  I must be completely taken off the internet
[1:55:54.660 --> 1:55:55.660]  Even my mention
[1:55:55.660 --> 1:55:56.660]  Facebook's already doing that
[1:55:56.660 --> 1:55:59.660]  That is beyond 1984
[1:55:59.660 --> 1:56:01.660]  And being airbrushed out of history
[1:56:01.660 --> 1:56:02.660]  So it's here
[1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:04.660]  Tyranny's not coming
[1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:05.660]  It's here
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:06.660]  We're going to go right back to Ben Garrison
[1:56:06.660 --> 1:56:07.660]  After a break
[1:56:07.660 --> 1:56:08.660]  Speak of the devil
[1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:10.660]  They can't stop you in the third dimension
[1:56:10.660 --> 1:56:11.660]  Taking action
[1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:14.660]  And Chris Pratt
[1:56:14.660 --> 1:56:16.660]  Was out wearing a shirt
[1:56:16.660 --> 1:56:18.660]  Photographed yesterday
[1:56:18.660 --> 1:56:20.660]  That said don't tread on me
[1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:23.660]  The American flag with a snake on it
[1:56:23.660 --> 1:56:25.660]  And I saw that and I called my head guy
[1:56:25.660 --> 1:56:27.660]  And I said what's the new design of the new shirt
[1:56:27.660 --> 1:56:29.660]  With the Betsy Ross flag
[1:56:29.660 --> 1:56:30.660]  He goes a snake on it
[1:56:30.660 --> 1:56:31.660]  And don't tread on me
[1:56:31.660 --> 1:56:32.660]  We thought that was perfect
[1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:34.660]  I said well I guess great minds think alike
[1:56:34.660 --> 1:56:36.660]  Pratt's wearing basically the same shirt I want
[1:56:36.660 --> 1:56:37.660]  Navy blue and everything
[1:56:37.660 --> 1:56:39.660]  I said just make it better
[1:56:39.660 --> 1:56:42.660]  We're printing 4,000 of them
[1:56:42.660 --> 1:56:44.660]  The last Betsy Ross flag sold out
[1:56:44.660 --> 1:56:45.660]  So it's two variants
[1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:46.660]  The regular American flag
[1:56:46.660 --> 1:56:47.660]  With don't tread on me
[1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:48.660]  With the Garrison snake
[1:56:48.660 --> 1:56:49.660]  On the back
[1:56:49.660 --> 1:56:50.660]  Infowars.com
[1:56:50.660 --> 1:56:51.660]  America's back
[1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:53.660]  And then another version
[1:56:53.660 --> 1:56:55.660]  That's the Betsy Ross flag
[1:56:55.660 --> 1:56:58.660]  With the snake saying don't tread on me
[1:56:58.660 --> 1:56:59.660]  With Infowars.com
[1:56:59.660 --> 1:57:00.660]  America's back on the back
[1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:03.660]  Only 4,000 of these
[1:57:03.660 --> 1:57:05.660]  Now this is high quality fabric
[1:57:05.660 --> 1:57:07.660]  It's extremely nice
[1:57:07.660 --> 1:57:09.660]  Just the shirts cost like $8, $9
[1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:11.660]  Depending on the size of them
[1:57:11.660 --> 1:57:12.660]  And the printings are the three bucks
[1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:14.660]  This is big, thick color printing
[1:57:14.660 --> 1:57:16.660]  So we make like five, six bucks at 1776
[1:57:16.660 --> 1:57:18.660]  But because we're running the sales still
[1:57:18.660 --> 1:57:20.660]  Normally it would be 1995
[1:57:20.660 --> 1:57:21.660]  They're 1776
[1:57:21.660 --> 1:57:23.660]  And I love doing these
[1:57:23.660 --> 1:57:25.660]  Limited edition shirts
[1:57:25.660 --> 1:57:26.660]  Limbaugh's come out with his own
[1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:27.660]  Gadsden flag shirt
[1:57:27.660 --> 1:57:28.660]  Great minds think alike
[1:57:28.660 --> 1:57:30.660]  But this one is even better I think
[1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:32.660]  Only 4,000 of these inspired
[1:57:32.660 --> 1:57:34.660]  By the Chris Pratt shirt that he was wearing
[1:57:34.660 --> 1:57:35.660]  But not really
[1:57:35.660 --> 1:57:36.660]  We already said to it last week
[1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:38.660]  But it reminded me we're doing it
[1:57:38.660 --> 1:57:40.660]  So Infowars.com

[1:58:47.660 --> 1:58:48.660]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York
[1:58:48.660 --> 1:58:50.660]  Marcus here on the air, thanks for holding
[1:58:50.660 --> 1:58:51.660]  Hey, I just want to say
[1:58:51.660 --> 1:58:53.660]  Your show is a breath of fresh air
[1:58:53.660 --> 1:58:55.660]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City
[1:58:55.660 --> 1:58:57.660]  And one thing I can tell you is that
[1:58:57.660 --> 1:58:59.660]  Almost nobody agrees with these wars
[1:58:59.660 --> 1:59:01.660]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately
[1:59:01.660 --> 1:59:03.660]  To get Trump to go to a war because
[1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:05.660]  They know that that's the only way
[1:59:05.660 --> 1:59:07.660]  That they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[1:59:07.660 --> 1:59:09.660]  The approaching 2020
[1:59:09.660 --> 1:59:11.660]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this
[1:59:11.660 --> 1:59:12.660]  It'll be the end of his presidency
[1:59:12.660 --> 1:59:14.660]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated
[1:59:14.660 --> 1:59:15.660]  Other than assassinating him
[1:59:15.660 --> 1:59:16.660]  It's a time to be praying, my friend
[1:59:16.660 --> 1:59:17.660]  I agree entirely
[1:59:17.660 --> 1:59:19.660]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex
[1:59:19.660 --> 1:59:21.660]  Is I know they're trying to shut you down
[1:59:21.660 --> 1:59:23.660]  But the reinforcements have arrived, man
[1:59:23.660 --> 1:59:25.660]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old
[1:59:25.660 --> 1:59:27.660]  I would love to see what you're talking about
[1:59:27.660 --> 1:59:28.660]  When you're 80
[1:59:28.660 --> 1:59:29.660]  But if they do shut you down
[1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.660]  No, you've gone into this war
[1:59:31.660 --> 1:59:33.660]  You've won a lot of battles
[1:59:33.660 --> 1:59:35.660]  There are a lot of people like myself
[1:59:35.660 --> 1:59:37.660]  And many others who are going to continue
[1:59:37.660 --> 1:59:39.660]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war
[1:59:39.660 --> 1:59:41.660]  And even if something does happen to you or your show
[1:59:41.660 --> 1:59:43.660]  Know for a fact that you've gotten
[1:59:43.660 --> 1:59:45.660]  A lot of people fired up for liberty
[1:59:45.660 --> 2:00:05.660]  Thank you, sir, for calling
[2:00:05.660 --> 2:00:09.660]  So Chris Pratt, who I do think is an entertaining actor
[2:00:09.660 --> 2:00:11.660]  Is a Christian
[2:00:11.660 --> 2:00:13.660]  And his mom worked at Safeway
[2:00:13.660 --> 2:00:14.660]  His dad was a minor
[2:00:14.660 --> 2:00:17.660]  Now the folks that know him, they say he's a really nice guy
[2:00:17.660 --> 2:00:22.660]  And that he's a patriot
[2:00:22.660 --> 2:00:24.660]  And then he just wore a don't tread on
[2:00:24.660 --> 2:00:27.660]  Me shirt about the American flag
[2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:30.660]  And they called him a white supremacist
[2:00:30.660 --> 2:00:31.660]  At the top of Yahoo
[2:00:31.660 --> 2:00:32.660]  Well, Yahoo changed that headline
[2:00:32.660 --> 2:00:34.660]  But they still have the article
[2:00:34.660 --> 2:00:35.660]  People calling him a white supremacist
[2:00:35.660 --> 2:00:36.660]  So we always warned
[2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:39.660]  Next would be the American flag, Ben Garrison
[2:00:39.660 --> 2:00:42.660]  Of graphics
[2:00:42.660 --> 2:00:44.660]  Of the top guy out there
[2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:46.660]  As a political cartoonist in the world
[2:00:46.660 --> 2:00:47.660]  I think it's conservative to say that
[2:00:47.660 --> 2:00:48.660]  I think it's the truth
[2:00:48.660 --> 2:00:50.660]  What do you make of this hysteria?
[2:00:50.660 --> 2:00:51.660]  Where does it end?
[2:00:51.660 --> 2:00:52.660]  What do we need to do to counter it?
[2:00:52.660 --> 2:00:55.660]  Because these people are out of control
[2:00:55.660 --> 2:00:58.660]  They can't beat us with logic and reason
[2:00:58.660 --> 2:00:59.660]  Because they have none
[2:00:59.660 --> 2:01:01.660]  They won't win the argument
[2:01:01.660 --> 2:01:03.660]  The conventional argument
[2:01:03.660 --> 2:01:05.660]  All they have is name calling
[2:01:05.660 --> 2:01:08.660]  And I was thinking about the names that I got called
[2:01:08.660 --> 2:01:11.660]  For example, a conspiracy theorist
[2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:14.660]  And it's a conspiracy theorist, Ben Garrison
[2:01:14.660 --> 2:01:15.660]  And they're using that
[2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:17.660]  Because as soon as somebody sees that
[2:01:17.660 --> 2:01:19.660]  They've been conditioned to
[2:01:19.660 --> 2:01:22.660]  Conditioned to ignore whatever that person has to say
[2:01:22.660 --> 2:01:24.660]  So they might as well say
[2:01:24.660 --> 2:01:26.660]  Wacky nut job, Ben Garrison
[2:01:26.660 --> 2:01:29.660]  And so you don't pay attention to what I say anymore
[2:01:29.660 --> 2:01:32.660]  So they're always prefacing things with that
[2:01:32.660 --> 2:01:34.660]  Or they'll call somebody a racist
[2:01:34.660 --> 2:01:37.660]  So what are they really after with that word?
[2:01:37.660 --> 2:01:38.660]  What they're really after
[2:01:38.660 --> 2:01:41.660]  They want us to say that if they call somebody
[2:01:41.660 --> 2:01:42.660]  They don't like a racist
[2:01:42.660 --> 2:01:44.660]  They're saying their heart is black
[2:01:44.660 --> 2:01:48.660]  They really don't have any soul or humanity
[2:01:48.660 --> 2:01:51.660]  And so any bad thing that happens to this person
[2:01:51.660 --> 2:01:54.660]  That we call a racist, they deserve it
[2:01:54.660 --> 2:01:56.660]  And that's the whole thing
[2:01:56.660 --> 2:01:59.660]  There's this litany of other tricks that they use
[2:01:59.660 --> 2:02:02.660]  They'll call cartoons a trope
[2:02:02.660 --> 2:02:04.660]  And they kept saying this over and over
[2:02:04.660 --> 2:02:07.660]  This is a trope for anti-Semitism
[2:02:07.660 --> 2:02:10.660]  All right, what does this trope mean anyway?
[2:02:10.660 --> 2:02:13.660]  Well, it simply means it's a cliche or metaphor
[2:02:13.660 --> 2:02:15.660]  Well, guess what? We cartoonists
[2:02:15.660 --> 2:02:17.660]  We traffic in metaphors and cliches
[2:02:17.660 --> 2:02:20.660]  All cartoons are built on metaphors and cliches
[2:02:20.660 --> 2:02:22.660]  Well, the truth is your cartoons are true
[2:02:22.660 --> 2:02:24.660]  In almost every Islamic country they kill gays
[2:02:24.660 --> 2:02:27.660]  So you show liberals welcoming the Muslims in
[2:02:27.660 --> 2:02:29.660]  The dumb-ass Democrat donkey
[2:02:29.660 --> 2:02:31.660]  And then it shows them killing gays
[2:02:31.660 --> 2:02:32.660]  That's what happens
[2:02:32.660 --> 2:02:35.660]  And so they want you banned
[2:02:35.660 --> 2:02:38.660]  As you're pointing out the elephant in the room
[2:02:38.660 --> 2:02:39.660]  Well, here's the thing
[2:02:39.660 --> 2:02:41.660]  And I did go out to Washington
[2:02:41.660 --> 2:02:44.660]  And it was worthwhile in many dimensions for me
[2:02:44.660 --> 2:02:47.660]  Namely, when this summit was going on
[2:02:47.660 --> 2:02:49.660]  At the exact same time
[2:02:49.660 --> 2:02:52.660]  I was at the National Art Gallery
[2:02:52.660 --> 2:02:55.660]  In a room filled with Rembrandt
[2:02:55.660 --> 2:02:58.660]  And that experience
[2:02:58.660 --> 2:03:00.660]  That's the first time I got to see him in person
[2:03:00.660 --> 2:03:02.660]  I've always seen him in book place
[2:03:02.660 --> 2:03:04.660]  But there's so much better in person
[2:03:04.660 --> 2:03:08.660]  You can see the soul that's in these paintings
[2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:10.660]  You can see the light
[2:03:10.660 --> 2:03:12.660]  I've seen them coming out of it
[2:03:12.660 --> 2:03:14.660]  He captured the soul
[2:03:14.660 --> 2:03:16.660]  Well, this is what it falls to
[2:03:16.660 --> 2:03:18.660]  He's telling you the truth
[2:03:18.660 --> 2:03:20.660]  It's an intangible truth
[2:03:20.660 --> 2:03:22.660]  I can't tell you exactly what the truth means
[2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:24.660]  But you look at it, this is true
[2:03:24.660 --> 2:03:26.660]  He's captured this man's character
[2:03:26.660 --> 2:03:28.660]  I've seen the Mona Lisa in person
[2:03:28.660 --> 2:03:30.660]  And when you see it, it's like the woman's there
[2:03:30.660 --> 2:03:32.660]  I know that's not Rembrandt
[2:03:32.660 --> 2:03:34.660]  But you look at it like
[2:03:34.660 --> 2:03:36.660]  The way he handles the black
[2:03:36.660 --> 2:03:38.660]  But it's not black, there's depth to it
[2:03:38.660 --> 2:03:40.660]  There's dimension
[2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:42.660]  I became a way
[2:03:42.660 --> 2:03:44.660]  How reassured and convinced
[2:03:44.660 --> 2:03:47.660]  That art, to me
[2:03:47.660 --> 2:03:49.660]  Should tell the truth
[2:03:49.660 --> 2:03:51.660]  And that's what I try to do with my cartoons
[2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:53.660]  And my fun art too
[2:03:53.660 --> 2:03:55.660]  But I want to try to tell the truth
[2:03:55.660 --> 2:03:58.660]  No matter how uncomfortable it might make some people
[2:03:58.660 --> 2:04:00.660]  We should not be afraid of telling the truth
[2:04:00.660 --> 2:04:02.660]  That's why we're here on the earth
[2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:04.660]  Is try to find out what it is
[2:04:04.660 --> 2:04:06.660]  Instead of perpetuating the lies
[2:04:06.660 --> 2:04:08.660]  That they want us to keep spewing
[2:04:08.660 --> 2:04:10.660]  About, you know
[2:04:10.660 --> 2:04:12.660]  Any topic as you can name
[2:04:12.660 --> 2:04:14.660]  It seems like they wanted to put their own spin on it
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:17.660]  It's almost like we're dealing with some kind of demonic force
[2:04:17.660 --> 2:04:19.660]  And they wanted to believe
[2:04:19.660 --> 2:04:21.660]  In this counterfeit narrative
[2:04:21.660 --> 2:04:23.660]  Of what's going on in life
[2:04:23.660 --> 2:04:25.660]  So I call it
[2:04:25.660 --> 2:04:27.660]  A union with reality
[2:04:27.660 --> 2:04:29.660]  So I try to stay aligned with reality
[2:04:29.660 --> 2:04:31.660]  Okay, Ben, now you're talking heavy stuff
[2:04:31.660 --> 2:04:33.660]  My direction, 110%
[2:04:33.660 --> 2:04:35.660]  To do a few more minutes, because you're on a roll here
[2:04:35.660 --> 2:04:38.660]  Absolutely, we're in line with truth
[2:04:38.660 --> 2:04:40.660]  We're resonating with truth
[2:04:40.660 --> 2:04:42.660]  And there is a demonic force that wants to twist
[2:04:42.660 --> 2:04:44.660]  And override and obscure the truth
[2:04:44.660 --> 2:04:47.660]  And that is the essence of what we're facing
[2:04:47.660 --> 2:04:50.660]  Good versus evil, we'll be right back in 60 seconds
[2:04:50.660 --> 2:04:52.660]  With Ben Garrison
[2:04:55.660 --> 2:04:58.660]  It's not only that you have a unique voice
[2:04:58.660 --> 2:05:00.660]  In the public arena and the public square
[2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:02.660]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars
[2:05:02.660 --> 2:05:04.660]  Is it is the only network of this reach
[2:05:04.660 --> 2:05:06.660]  That is not backed by a corporate donor
[2:05:06.660 --> 2:05:08.660]  Or corporate sugar daddy
[2:05:08.660 --> 2:05:10.660]  That's not backed by some billionaire
[2:05:10.660 --> 2:05:12.660]  That's not being funded by a secret foreign government
[2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:14.660]  It is completely independent of all that
[2:05:14.660 --> 2:05:17.660]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment
[2:05:17.660 --> 2:05:19.660]  In the expression of the freedom of press
[2:05:19.660 --> 2:05:21.660]  And freedom of speech
[2:05:21.660 --> 2:05:23.660]  That in fact the founders were so concerned with
[2:05:23.660 --> 2:05:25.660]  At the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support
[2:05:25.660 --> 2:05:27.660]  And subsidize organizations just like this
[2:05:27.660 --> 2:05:29.660]  Because this was the kind of press they wanted
[2:05:29.660 --> 2:05:31.660]  And then ultimately we now live in an era
[2:05:31.660 --> 2:05:33.660]  Where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[2:05:33.660 --> 2:05:35.660]  Or billionaire sugar daddies
[2:05:35.660 --> 2:05:37.660]  Who've been able to control and manipulate
[2:05:37.660 --> 2:05:39.660]  What news and views the person is allowed to have
[2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:41.660]  Or express or hear
[2:05:41.660 --> 2:05:43.660]  And the Info Wars audience has broken through that
[2:05:43.660 --> 2:05:45.660]  They are the bridge from the founding
[2:05:45.660 --> 2:05:48.660]  To the modern age, ultimate American democracy and freedom
[2:05:48.660 --> 2:05:51.660]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[2:05:51.660 --> 2:05:53.660]  Of the platforming, defamation, lawfare
[2:05:53.660 --> 2:05:57.660]  And libel targeting youth
[2:05:57.660 --> 2:06:08.660]  Big brother mainstream media
[2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:10.660]  Government cover-ups
[2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:12.660]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:06:12.660 --> 2:06:14.660]  Well so does he
[2:06:14.660 --> 2:06:16.660]  Live from Austin, Texas
[2:06:16.660 --> 2:06:18.660]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:06:18.660 --> 2:06:27.660]  It's Alex Jones
[2:06:27.660 --> 2:06:30.660]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm
[2:06:30.660 --> 2:06:32.660]  I'm here live in defiance of the globalists
[2:06:32.660 --> 2:06:34.660]  In defiance of all their tyranny
[2:06:34.660 --> 2:06:36.660]  All their attempts to shut us down
[2:06:36.660 --> 2:06:38.660]  Only because of your support
[2:06:38.660 --> 2:06:40.660]  Your prayers and your word of mouth
[2:06:40.660 --> 2:06:42.660]  And all of those are so critical
[2:06:42.660 --> 2:06:45.660]  But Ben Garrison is not just my favorite
[2:06:45.660 --> 2:06:48.660]  Political graphic cartoonist
[2:06:48.660 --> 2:06:50.660]  I read the newspaper
[2:06:50.660 --> 2:06:52.660]  I scan the internet
[2:06:52.660 --> 2:06:54.660]  There aren't really a lot of good ones out there
[2:06:54.660 --> 2:06:56.660]  They're a few, they do a great job
[2:06:56.660 --> 2:06:59.660]  They don't even begin to rival Ben Garrison
[2:06:59.660 --> 2:07:02.660]  He's definitely the most prolific
[2:07:02.660 --> 2:07:05.660]  And it's very exciting to have him on
[2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:08.660]  With us right now
[2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:10.660]  Finishing up, you talked about
[2:07:10.660 --> 2:07:12.660]  Going to some of the great museums in DC
[2:07:12.660 --> 2:07:15.660]  One thing, it's the Smithsonian
[2:07:15.660 --> 2:07:18.660]  And the National Archives
[2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:20.660]  You can spend months there, folks
[2:07:20.660 --> 2:07:22.660]  Oh yeah, oh yeah
[2:07:22.660 --> 2:07:24.660]  You were seeing Rembrandt
[2:07:24.660 --> 2:07:27.660]  And how you can see the soul of the person
[2:07:27.660 --> 2:07:30.660]  The paintings glow like they are
[2:07:30.660 --> 2:07:33.660]  Beyond a photo of somebody
[2:07:33.660 --> 2:07:35.660]  It somehow brings out the essence
[2:07:35.660 --> 2:07:37.660]  It's not a cartoon, it's not a photo
[2:07:37.660 --> 2:07:39.660]  There's something magic to it
[2:07:39.660 --> 2:07:41.660]  You were saying, truth
[2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:44.660]  You were describing it as almost demonic
[2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:47.660]  Speak to that for a couple of minutes
[2:07:47.660 --> 2:07:53.660]  The left has gone so far
[2:07:53.660 --> 2:07:55.660]  They've gotten so radicalized
[2:07:55.660 --> 2:07:57.660]  They've pushed it so far
[2:07:57.660 --> 2:08:00.660]  That now it's becoming fashionable to hate America
[2:08:00.660 --> 2:08:03.660]  And anybody who, like what you alluded to
[2:08:03.660 --> 2:08:05.660]  About the flag, if you wear the flag
[2:08:05.660 --> 2:08:08.660]  All of a sudden you're a white supremacist
[2:08:08.660 --> 2:08:12.660]  But they've jumped a shark
[2:08:12.660 --> 2:08:14.660]  They've jumped like a hundred sharks
[2:08:14.660 --> 2:08:17.660]  But they keep trying to
[2:08:17.660 --> 2:08:20.660]  Continue what Obama was doing
[2:08:20.660 --> 2:08:22.660]  And that's to destroy America
[2:08:22.660 --> 2:08:23.660]  And why did they do that?
[2:08:23.660 --> 2:08:25.660]  Because they want their socialism
[2:08:25.660 --> 2:08:27.660]  They want people addicted to big government
[2:08:27.660 --> 2:08:29.660]  That's why they promised the free stuff
[2:08:29.660 --> 2:08:32.660]  That's why they want to control
[2:08:32.660 --> 2:08:35.660]  Anybody's free speech so we can't speak out against it
[2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:38.660]  And we've got to go down to this dark path
[2:08:38.660 --> 2:08:41.660]  Where they want everybody made equal
[2:08:41.660 --> 2:08:43.660]  Well, what's going to happen is everybody
[2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:45.660]  Will end up equally poor
[2:08:45.660 --> 2:08:47.660]  But the young people's minds are the word
[2:08:47.660 --> 2:08:49.660]  They're going after them the most
[2:08:49.660 --> 2:08:51.660]  By promising them free stuff
[2:08:51.660 --> 2:08:53.660]  And it's like the easy outlet for them
[2:08:53.660 --> 2:08:56.660]  And so what I'm going to do in my cartoons
[2:08:56.660 --> 2:09:01.660]  Is continue to make the case that socialism is evil
[2:09:01.660 --> 2:09:03.660]  Because that's what I think it is
[2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:06.660]  And in the failed political philosophy
[2:09:06.660 --> 2:09:08.660]  It's outright evil
[2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:10.660]  And that's what, it's good versus evil
[2:09:10.660 --> 2:09:12.660]  Alex, you know this
[2:09:12.660 --> 2:09:14.660]  And when you're in that room with the Rembrandts
[2:09:14.660 --> 2:09:16.660]  You know what good is
[2:09:16.660 --> 2:09:19.660]  Because he, looking at these
[2:09:19.660 --> 2:09:22.660]  It makes you proud to be a human being
[2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:24.660]  And the left does not want to make you proud
[2:09:24.660 --> 2:09:26.660]  They want to make you feel like
[2:09:26.660 --> 2:09:28.660]  Nothing can happen without their government
[2:09:28.660 --> 2:09:32.660]  You have to have government to make the decisions for everything
[2:09:32.660 --> 2:09:34.660]  How dare you have some freedom
[2:09:34.660 --> 2:09:36.660]  You might abuse that
[2:09:36.660 --> 2:09:38.660]  You might hurt somebody's feelings
[2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:40.660]  This is like, we're really, these people
[2:09:40.660 --> 2:09:42.660]  They're on the road to the sad
[2:09:42.660 --> 2:09:44.660]  That's why I drew them in a loony bin
[2:09:44.660 --> 2:09:46.660]  In a rubber room with straight jackets
[2:09:46.660 --> 2:09:49.660]  I mean, how do you argue with somebody who's insane?
[2:09:49.660 --> 2:09:50.660]  You can't
[2:09:50.660 --> 2:09:52.660]  And these people are insane
[2:09:52.660 --> 2:09:56.660]  You can't have a discussion with people like this
[2:09:56.660 --> 2:10:00.660]  So this is why I think Trump is going to win easily
[2:10:00.660 --> 2:10:03.660]  Still kind of wonder if Hillary's going to run
[2:10:03.660 --> 2:10:06.660]  I'm thinking that they're setting up all these far left
[2:10:06.660 --> 2:10:09.660]  And further, further, further left whack jobs
[2:10:09.660 --> 2:10:15.660]  So Hillary will be seen as this paradigm of reason and logic
[2:10:15.660 --> 2:10:17.660]  And the only person who could beat Trump
[2:10:17.660 --> 2:10:19.660]  I think I would be surprised
[2:10:19.660 --> 2:10:22.660]  Look, sometimes I'm wrong
[2:10:22.660 --> 2:10:25.660]  But only because the people change their minds
[2:10:25.660 --> 2:10:27.660]  We were told by the Secret Service
[2:10:27.660 --> 2:10:28.660]  She has a black ambulance
[2:10:28.660 --> 2:10:30.660]  She falls down all the time
[2:10:30.660 --> 2:10:32.660]  And then somebody caught her falling down having a convulsion
[2:10:32.660 --> 2:10:34.660]  And we first reported that
[2:10:34.660 --> 2:10:37.660]  I mean, the Secret Service did tell us this
[2:10:37.660 --> 2:10:40.660]  Then I got told by folks that had been
[2:10:40.660 --> 2:10:44.660]  Blackwater, CIA, Secret Service, all of it
[2:10:44.660 --> 2:10:46.660]  I mean, it's a small community
[2:10:46.660 --> 2:10:48.660]  I've been told by every one of these guys I know
[2:10:48.660 --> 2:10:49.660]  Some of them are quite famous
[2:10:49.660 --> 2:10:50.660]  Some aren't
[2:10:50.660 --> 2:10:51.660]  That Hillary's totally rude
[2:10:51.660 --> 2:10:52.660]  She screams at people
[2:10:52.660 --> 2:10:53.660]  She hates dogs
[2:10:53.660 --> 2:10:55.660]  It's all the same stories
[2:10:55.660 --> 2:10:58.660]  They have been in the last year
[2:10:58.660 --> 2:10:59.660]  Two different guys told me
[2:10:59.660 --> 2:11:01.660]  Where Hillary's telling her bye to what to do
[2:11:01.660 --> 2:11:02.660]  She's on the phone
[2:11:02.660 --> 2:11:04.660]  And she's got her exploratory committee already going
[2:11:04.660 --> 2:11:06.660]  And she's already planning to run
[2:11:06.660 --> 2:11:08.660]  She's certainly in control of the Democratic Party still
[2:11:08.660 --> 2:11:09.660]  What's the matter?
[2:11:09.660 --> 2:11:11.660]  She's got some money
[2:11:11.660 --> 2:11:12.660]  Yeah
[2:11:12.660 --> 2:11:14.660]  She's got all the money in the world
[2:11:14.660 --> 2:11:15.660]  Well, exactly
[2:11:15.660 --> 2:11:16.660]  So what I'm getting at is
[2:11:16.660 --> 2:11:17.660]  She may not run
[2:11:17.660 --> 2:11:19.660]  But she sure as hell is telling people
[2:11:19.660 --> 2:11:20.660]  She's looking at still doing it
[2:11:20.660 --> 2:11:22.660]  And then
[2:11:22.660 --> 2:11:24.660]  Biden is shooting his mouth off saying
[2:11:24.660 --> 2:11:25.660]  I may drop out
[2:11:25.660 --> 2:11:26.660]  Doesn't mean he is
[2:11:26.660 --> 2:11:28.660]  But he was saying this in front of people
[2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:29.660]  And saying, why am I here?
[2:11:29.660 --> 2:11:30.660]  Why am I doing this?
[2:11:30.660 --> 2:11:32.660]  Well, days after I learned he's doing that
[2:11:32.660 --> 2:11:34.660]  He starts saying it on the podium
[2:11:34.660 --> 2:11:35.660]  To his crew
[2:11:35.660 --> 2:11:36.660]  Like, why am I here?
[2:11:36.660 --> 2:11:37.660]  Why am I doing this?
[2:11:37.660 --> 2:11:39.660]  Because he's going in and out of gear
[2:11:39.660 --> 2:11:41.660]  You know, we've all had families that gets older, gets Alzheimer's
[2:11:41.660 --> 2:11:43.660]  And, you know, when they first start getting it
[2:11:43.660 --> 2:11:44.660]  They're there totally, they remember
[2:11:44.660 --> 2:11:45.660]  And then for like a few hours
[2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:47.660]  They don't know, you know, they're kind of
[2:11:47.660 --> 2:11:48.660]  And I see that with Biden
[2:11:48.660 --> 2:11:49.660]  So I agree with you
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:11:51.660]  With this super weak field out there
[2:11:51.660 --> 2:11:53.660]  And any real contenders holding back
[2:11:53.660 --> 2:11:54.660]  What do you think it is?
[2:11:54.660 --> 2:11:57.660]  Because Hillary's in the wings?
[2:11:57.660 --> 2:11:58.660]  Well, that's my suspicion
[2:11:58.660 --> 2:12:00.660]  And I'm not alone in that suspicion
[2:12:00.660 --> 2:12:04.660]  And frankly, I kind of have like this, you know
[2:12:04.660 --> 2:12:07.660]  A guilty pleasure of hoping she does
[2:12:07.660 --> 2:12:08.660]  Because I love to draw her
[2:12:08.660 --> 2:12:11.660]  So it would be really fun to have a Hillary too
[2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:13.660]  And I have to go through the, you know
[2:12:13.660 --> 2:12:14.660]  Because I like to caricature her
[2:12:14.660 --> 2:12:17.660]  And I think she epitomizes the
[2:12:17.660 --> 2:12:19.660]  Globalist mindset of evil
[2:12:19.660 --> 2:12:20.660]  And I think that's what she is, her
[2:12:20.660 --> 2:12:22.660]  She's got a pretty black heart
[2:12:22.660 --> 2:12:24.660]  So yeah, I wouldn't mind drawing her
[2:12:24.660 --> 2:12:26.660]  And next go around if she decides to run
[2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:29.660]  But if it's Elizabeth Warren, the same deal
[2:12:29.660 --> 2:12:32.660]  I mean, boy, she's a piece of work
[2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:34.660]  But I would enjoy caricaturing her
[2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:36.660]  Or any of those guys
[2:12:36.660 --> 2:12:39.660]  I mean, it's going to be, for a cartoonist
[2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:41.660]  It's going to be easy pickings
[2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:42.660]  Absolutely
[2:12:42.660 --> 2:12:44.660]  Well, Ben Garrison, what's the best side?
[2:12:44.660 --> 2:12:45.660]  I see a lot of places that syndicate your work
[2:12:45.660 --> 2:12:47.660]  We post some of it
[2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:49.660]  Not nearly enough, graphics.com
[2:12:49.660 --> 2:12:52.660]  G-R-R-R, graphics.com
[2:12:52.660 --> 2:12:55.660]  And I see some other sites that post your stuff daily
[2:12:55.660 --> 2:12:57.660]  Oh, by the way, this cartoon here
[2:12:57.660 --> 2:12:59.660]  I gave the book I was going to give the president
[2:12:59.660 --> 2:13:01.660]  The coffee table book, the proof of it
[2:13:01.660 --> 2:13:03.660]  I gave it to Carpy Dongtum
[2:13:03.660 --> 2:13:05.660]  And he was really thrilled to get it
[2:13:05.660 --> 2:13:07.660]  And it's a heavy book, it's over five pounds
[2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:08.660]  It's a massive book
[2:13:08.660 --> 2:13:10.660]  And our book, and our coffee table book
[2:13:10.660 --> 2:13:12.660]  Should be arriving sometime in August
[2:13:12.660 --> 2:13:13.660]  And we'll mail them all out
[2:13:13.660 --> 2:13:16.660]  We have a thousand heavy books to mail out in August
[2:13:16.660 --> 2:13:18.660]  But those were completely sold out
[2:13:18.660 --> 2:13:21.660]  And it was a tribute to all the influencers
[2:13:21.660 --> 2:13:22.660]  And some of the more popular
[2:13:22.660 --> 2:13:24.660]  I met the guy, Mad Liberals
[2:13:24.660 --> 2:13:27.660]  And this guy, this guy was on genius
[2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:30.660]  With doctoring up videos and things
[2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:32.660]  I was looking at some of the stuff he did
[2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:36.660]  And it was just amazingly creative and funny
[2:13:36.660 --> 2:13:40.660]  And the people there, I'm telling you, Alex
[2:13:40.660 --> 2:13:43.660]  These guys are really going to have effect
[2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:45.660]  On the next election
[2:13:45.660 --> 2:13:47.660]  They really are influencers
[2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:48.660]  Absolutely
[2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:49.660]  Well, Ben, keep it up
[2:13:49.660 --> 2:13:50.660]  We love you, we appreciate you
[2:13:50.660 --> 2:13:51.660]  We'll talk to you soon
[2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:52.660]  Okay, Alex
[2:13:52.660 --> 2:13:53.660]  Thank you
[2:13:53.660 --> 2:13:55.660]  Okay, folks, there goes Ben Garrison
[2:13:55.660 --> 2:13:56.660]  I won't open the phones up
[2:13:56.660 --> 2:13:58.660]  And I want to get to a bunch of news
[2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:00.660]  I haven't even covered yet
[2:14:00.660 --> 2:14:01.660]  The latest
[2:14:01.660 --> 2:14:03.660]  Trump is a socialite
[2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:05.660]  Trump owns dozens of hotels
[2:14:05.660 --> 2:14:06.660]  Dozens of golf courts
[2:14:06.660 --> 2:14:07.660]  Hundreds of buildings
[2:14:07.660 --> 2:14:09.660]  He has giant parties everywhere
[2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:12.660]  They've gone through all the archives at NBC
[2:14:12.660 --> 2:14:15.660]  And found one video of him in 92
[2:14:15.660 --> 2:14:19.660]  Introducing people into a giant party ballroom
[2:14:19.660 --> 2:14:24.660]  And watching cheerleaders from a major football team
[2:14:24.660 --> 2:14:27.660]  And Trump's just talking to people
[2:14:27.660 --> 2:14:29.660]  And they're going, oh, look, he's with Epstein
[2:14:29.660 --> 2:14:31.660]  No, it's Bill Clinton on the airplane with Epstein
[2:14:31.660 --> 2:14:33.660]  It's Mueller working with Epstein
[2:14:33.660 --> 2:14:35.660]  And giving him immunity, not Trump
[2:14:35.660 --> 2:14:37.660]  So that video, when we come back
[2:14:37.660 --> 2:14:40.660]  It's up on infowars.com and newswars.com
[2:14:40.660 --> 2:14:43.660]  And also the Washington Post and the New York Times
[2:14:43.660 --> 2:14:45.660]  To ruin the Apollo moon landing anniversary
[2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:47.660]  With woke identity politics
[2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:50.660]  About how horrible it was because it was just men
[2:14:50.660 --> 2:14:54.660]  Just like it was just men on the beaches of Normandy
[2:14:54.660 --> 2:14:56.660]  This is a sick culture, man
[2:14:56.660 --> 2:14:58.660]  Where everything to the leftist template
[2:14:58.660 --> 2:15:00.660]  Is how we're bad and how our history is bad
[2:15:00.660 --> 2:15:02.660]  This is sick to destroy our families
[2:15:02.660 --> 2:15:07.660]  Speaking of art, we have the new American flag
[2:15:07.660 --> 2:15:09.660]  A Betsy Ross and a regular American flag
[2:15:09.660 --> 2:15:11.660]  All 50 stars with the snake on it
[2:15:11.660 --> 2:15:13.660]  Says don't tread on me, meaning the American flag
[2:15:13.660 --> 2:15:15.660]  A double meaning on the back
[2:15:15.660 --> 2:15:18.660]  America's back, infowars.com
[2:15:18.660 --> 2:15:20.660]  I already had the idea for the shirt last week
[2:15:20.660 --> 2:15:22.660]  Basically this exact shirt, told them to produce it
[2:15:22.660 --> 2:15:24.660]  Then I saw Chris Pratt wearing one
[2:15:24.660 --> 2:15:26.660]  And then calling it white supremacist
[2:15:26.660 --> 2:15:28.660]  All over the nose yesterday
[2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:29.660]  4,000 of these are being printed
[2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:32.660]  It helps funder operation, super high quality fabric
[2:15:32.660 --> 2:15:34.660]  I haven't ended the 1776 worldwide special
[2:15:34.660 --> 2:15:35.660]  I've been so busy
[2:15:35.660 --> 2:15:37.660]  So this brand new shirt limited edition
[2:15:37.660 --> 2:15:39.660]  For just today, there will be new specials tomorrow
[2:15:39.660 --> 2:15:42.660]  It's 1776, it'll go back to 1995
[2:15:42.660 --> 2:15:43.660]  But it's a designer shirt
[2:15:43.660 --> 2:15:45.660]  You get them all for 40 bucks
[2:15:45.660 --> 2:15:47.660]  Okay, it's only making like 5 bucks on this shirt
[2:15:47.660 --> 2:15:49.660]  But it's how we fund ourselves
[2:15:49.660 --> 2:15:50.660]  So get them, they're great
[2:15:50.660 --> 2:15:53.660]  It'll trigger leftist, infowars.com
[2:15:53.660 --> 2:16:16.660]  And then what we'llee

[2:18:55.700 --> 2:19:00.900]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats.
[2:19:00.900 --> 2:19:05.220]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[2:19:05.220 --> 2:19:10.500]  and make your own decisions hits are the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[2:19:10.500 --> 2:19:14.020]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the
[2:19:14.020 --> 2:19:18.580]  third dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[2:19:18.580 --> 2:19:23.780]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[2:19:23.780 --> 2:19:30.100]  for InfowarsLife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that
[2:19:30.100 --> 2:19:35.380]  was incredibly high quality metal bottle and double the strength of it in a new formula,
[2:19:35.380 --> 2:19:41.700]  Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality B12 over the counter that you're

[2:20:17.140 --> 2:20:35.540]  When the evening sun goes down, you will find me hanging out. The night life ain't a good life,
[2:20:35.540 --> 2:21:03.540]  but it's my life. Many people just like me dreaming of old used to be. And the night life ain't a good life, but it's my life.
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:09.860]  All right, folks, we're back live here. Your TV viewer, you see Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:21:11.300 --> 2:21:18.580]  You heard me talk about Jeffrey Epstein 10 years ago, if you were listening to us in say 2009.
[2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:26.020]  That's when he got convicted of being a child molester. And we started reporting on Bill Clinton
[2:21:26.020 --> 2:21:32.740]  and the aircraft and the torture cells and Hollywood branding women and everything I told you was
[2:21:32.740 --> 2:21:42.180]  being given to me by FBI Patriots. Gosh, I used to have Ted Gunderson on before he died.
[2:21:46.020 --> 2:21:53.060]  And he'd say scuff on a show and it just sounded crazy and it all turned out to be exactly what he said.
[2:21:53.060 --> 2:22:06.900]  And then John DeKant, he ended up getting Alzheimer's. He was in the CIA, Project Phoenix,
[2:22:09.140 --> 2:22:13.700]  Senator John DeKant, but he didn't like to rape little kids so he exposed that whole thing in the
[2:22:13.700 --> 2:22:22.420]  Republican Party. Oh, he was involved right at the top of Operation Phoenix, which wasn't very friendly,
[2:22:24.500 --> 2:22:29.700]  but he wouldn't rape little kids. So that's kind of the litmus test you see between good and evil.
[2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:40.740]  And so we know all about these people and if I ever got a smell of Donald Trump doing anything to
[2:22:40.740 --> 2:22:45.700]  kids, I would have nothing to do with him. But you notice the Pito armies who got it all over them,
[2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:50.660]  they're covered in it. They're pointing at him with not one drop on him and saying,
[2:22:51.540 --> 2:22:57.620]  oh, you know, Jeffrey Epstein was at a few parties with Trump and Epstein did a few business deals
[2:22:57.620 --> 2:23:03.540]  with some of his companies. I mean, Trump has thousands of properties. And so there's the
[2:23:03.540 --> 2:23:15.780]  proof. And then finally 1992, that's almost 30 years ago. That's 28 years ago. He's at a big
[2:23:15.780 --> 2:23:20.980]  giant ballroom. NBC doesn't even put out the full clips because obviously there's people coming in
[2:23:20.980 --> 2:23:25.700]  and out. He's saying things to them. They're pointing at the cheerleaders who are doing a
[2:23:25.700 --> 2:23:37.060]  number, not high school cheerleaders, football NFL cheerleaders and saying, boy, she's pretty.
[2:23:37.060 --> 2:23:43.380]  And then the news I've got clips I'll play of Mika Brzezinski comment how scary it is. And
[2:23:43.380 --> 2:23:51.700]  other MSNBC go see NBC. This is scary. Mika Brzezinski, your husband got found in his office
[2:23:51.700 --> 2:24:01.140]  with a beautiful intern's head caved in and he's known as creepy Joe Scarborough. He's also known
[2:24:01.140 --> 2:24:10.980]  as psycho Joe. Why do you think Trump calls him psycho Joe? She had her head caved in.
[2:24:12.660 --> 2:24:16.980]  And her panties down around her ankles. But all that got suppressed, didn't it?
[2:24:16.980 --> 2:24:26.980]  My old psycho Joe, you're married to the main suspect in an unsolved murder.
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:36.820]  She likes it because her daddy's a mass murderer too. Her daddy bragged that he helped kill tens of
[2:24:36.820 --> 2:24:44.100]  millions of people by using the communists to do it in the Khmer Rouge. She likes her daddy.
[2:24:44.100 --> 2:24:51.220]  Her daddy was a killer. I wonder what they talk about when he's probably got like a
[2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:57.620]  tourniquet around her neck. I wonder if he simulates bashing her brains up like daddy would do.
[2:24:58.580 --> 2:25:05.540]  Wonder what daddy did to Mika. So she's married to a dude found with a dead body in his office.
[2:25:05.540 --> 2:25:18.740]  They got covered up and now he's been a good servant. Psycho Joe. Oh, but now, oh, 28 years ago,
[2:25:18.740 --> 2:25:23.380]  Trump was at a ballroom and we've got 10 seconds of tape here. Let's roll the evil. Here it is.
[2:25:25.700 --> 2:25:32.740]  So we want to show you now some footage from 1992 that our producers found in the NBC
[2:25:32.740 --> 2:25:40.100]  archives that shows Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a sex offender and accused
[2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:48.660]  sex trafficker looking at and talking about women at a party. Welcome to the Southern White House.
[2:25:48.660 --> 2:25:54.420]  Since becoming president, Donald Trump has branded Mar-a-Lago the Southern White House,
[2:25:54.420 --> 2:25:59.380]  a place that entertains foreign leaders where military strikes are ordered and
[2:25:59.380 --> 2:26:05.300]  whose terrorists served as an open air situation room over dessert. And we had the most beautiful
[2:26:05.300 --> 2:26:10.260]  piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen. But in the nineties, Mar-a-Lago was Trump's
[2:26:10.260 --> 2:26:16.900]  South Florida party palace, one frequented by Jeffrey Epstein, who is facing charges for sex
[2:26:16.900 --> 2:26:22.020]  trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty. The president says his relationship with Epstein
[2:26:22.020 --> 2:26:27.460]  was no different than anyone else in their elite circle. Well, I knew him like everybody in Palm
[2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:32.100]  Beach knew him. He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.
[2:26:32.100 --> 2:26:41.060]  I wasn't a fan. Yet a tape in the NBC archives of a Mar-a-Lago party shows Trump giving Epstein
[2:26:41.060 --> 2:26:50.260]  his personal attention. The footage shot in November of 1992, before Trump opened the resort
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:55.140]  of the club, shows the future president surrounded by cheerleaders for the Buffalo
[2:26:55.140 --> 2:27:04.580]  Hill Miami Dolphins. I like him even more for an appearance on Faith Daniels NBC talk show.
[2:27:04.580 --> 2:27:09.620]  We're going to get great ratings in your show. Trump is surrounded by women as music players.
[2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:13.860]  Hit pause again. Yeah, he's got like five kids. He's had three wives. What the hell do you think
[2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:21.860]  he's doing? I mean, again, these are full grown women all over him. 28 years ago. She's like,
[2:27:21.860 --> 2:27:26.100]  he says he hasn't talked to him in 15 years, but here he is 28 years ago.
[2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:35.780]  I mean, this is Mika Brzezinski, whose father is a famous mass murderer or war criminal.
[2:27:35.780 --> 2:27:42.740]  Mary DeWitt did, found with the interns clothes torn off with her head bashed in his office.
[2:27:42.740 --> 2:27:49.940]  Here, let's go back. After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests. Among them,
[2:27:49.940 --> 2:27:55.380]  the financier Jeffrey Epstein. Oh my gosh. More than a decade before his guilty plea
[2:27:55.380 --> 2:28:01.540]  on state prostitution charges. Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to another man.
[2:28:01.540 --> 2:28:06.340]  That's it for Trump. Dancing in front of them. Oh my gosh. Alternates between dancing and
[2:28:06.340 --> 2:28:10.980]  pointing out women to Epstein and the other. Hit pause for a minute. At his hotel,
[2:28:11.700 --> 2:28:18.900]  at his private club, he's shaking guest hands. Ladies and gentlemen, you have a party at your big
[2:28:18.900 --> 2:28:27.060]  hotel, the state place, and you shake people's hands when they, it's over folks. Epstein became
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:32.900]  a member there. Trump threw him out. They all know what they're doing, but there is Mika Brzezinski
[2:28:32.900 --> 2:28:42.660]  with the creepy psycho Joe next to her. And they're trying to project this fraud. Look,
[2:28:42.660 --> 2:28:49.060]  there he is. And there's women. He was in between marriages that he had girlfriends, a man with
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:57.140]  women. Hell, Trump could probably repopulate the earth we need him to. Attention GCN self-reliance

[2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:19.700]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[2:29:19.700 --> 2:29:24.020]  Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a
[2:29:24.020 --> 2:29:28.420]  temporary location. And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system
[2:29:28.420 --> 2:29:33.380]  at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's

[2:31:00.580 --> 2:31:05.540]  info wars ground zero for the censorship. Alex Jones, patient zero for the censorship,
[2:31:05.540 --> 2:31:09.140]  doesn't even get an invite, but that's fine. We'll play the dark night. We hope that there's
[2:31:09.140 --> 2:31:12.900]  other people there that will bring us up, bring Alex Jones up, bring some of the other
[2:31:12.900 --> 2:31:17.860]  band names like Gavin McGinnis and Milo Unatlas and Laura Loomer up as well. And they won't be
[2:31:18.420 --> 2:31:22.580]  bullied by some of the conservatives that like to censor those voices as well
[2:31:22.580 --> 2:31:26.180]  at the summit. But we'll see. I have a feeling this is just going to be throwing a dog a bone,
[2:31:26.180 --> 2:31:31.300]  patting him on the head and telling him to move on with his day. But hopefully maybe this spurs
[2:31:31.300 --> 2:31:36.740]  some action from Congress, from the president, from the White House to do something about the
[2:31:36.740 --> 2:31:41.860]  big tech censorship before the 2020 elections when it's going to be so key. It was info wars
[2:31:41.860 --> 2:31:47.380]  presence on social media that helped get Trump into the White House. That's why we are targeted.
[2:31:47.380 --> 2:31:57.380]  So let's see what happens at the social media summit 2019 for info wars.com. This is Owen Schreuer.
[2:31:57.380 --> 2:32:02.020]  Money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this. And we're seeing a lot of orders
[2:32:02.020 --> 2:32:08.020]  right now with the save info wars 50% off. But we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[2:32:08.020 --> 2:32:12.500]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price. And we're moving a ton of it. Okay. But
[2:32:12.500 --> 2:32:16.980]  you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000 that doesn't pay for
[2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:20.660]  all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew. So we need to sell millions and millions
[2:32:20.660 --> 2:32:25.140]  and millions of dollars of product. I want to expand, not contract. And for six months, we've
[2:32:25.140 --> 2:32:29.540]  not just made a standstill. The enemy's been winning. And I have labored and labored and labored
[2:32:29.540 --> 2:32:33.460]  and labored on this. I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting. And we
[2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:37.700]  are winning the info war. That's why we're so hated. But we need to be retreaded. We need to be
[2:32:37.700 --> 2:32:41.380]  tuned up. We need to be fixed up. We never have time to get into drive up. We got a lot of holes
[2:32:41.380 --> 2:32:46.740]  shot at us. And the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant child porn on
[2:32:46.740 --> 2:32:49.860]  us. Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else. I mean, the Democrats now are
[2:32:49.860 --> 2:32:53.780]  going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks and the chai comms. So go to
[2:32:53.780 --> 2:33:18.260]  infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:18.260 --> 2:33:28.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am not trying to brag. In fact, I don't think this universe is a simulation.
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:34.580]  I believe you're real. I believe you exist. I know I exist. I know God exists. I know evil exists.
[2:33:36.500 --> 2:33:43.380]  But I did tell my dad in my living room a year ago, pretty much this time of year in July,
[2:33:43.380 --> 2:33:50.100]  that they're going to ban me first. And then they're going to use that as a precedent to ban
[2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:55.380]  everybody else. But I think within a year or so, Congress will begin to start taking action.
[2:33:55.380 --> 2:33:58.740]  And I believe Google and others have bit off more than they could chew once they learn
[2:34:00.420 --> 2:34:05.380]  that the communist Chinese and the EU and the UN are coming in to regulate our internet.
[2:34:06.500 --> 2:34:13.300]  This whole fake libertarian laissez-faire, oh, we don't regulate companies is being used to then
[2:34:13.300 --> 2:34:20.420]  by extension, let foreign control in via the vacuum, which then regulates and controls and
[2:34:20.420 --> 2:34:24.580]  censors. It's the same thing. It's a worldwide system. It's the first global government.
[2:34:26.500 --> 2:34:31.700]  Is the internet, the intergalactic communication system that some psychiatrists in the 50s
[2:34:31.700 --> 2:34:36.420]  envisioned and then that the Pentagon and DARPA developed in the 1960s? I mean, that's the real
[2:34:36.420 --> 2:34:44.500]  internet folks. And all of it's come true. Just like I said on Erretwood, I went in front of the
[2:34:44.500 --> 2:34:49.380]  tech heads. I said, you're traders to China. Now Elon Musk is talking about it. The president says
[2:34:49.380 --> 2:34:56.020]  there's a consensus. Blumenthal says there's now a consensus. You know, the clock is up.
[2:34:56.740 --> 2:35:01.300]  The timebell is rung. I'm about to play it. We're going to regulate you. Well, they've been trying
[2:35:01.300 --> 2:35:05.220]  to kind of stop all that. They just wanted censorship. But now they know it's here. So
[2:35:05.220 --> 2:35:09.940]  they're going to jump in and try to use the needed breaking up of big tech. It's way bigger than
[2:35:09.940 --> 2:35:15.140]  standard oil ever was way bigger than JP Morgan ever was way bigger than mob L was when it got
[2:35:15.140 --> 2:35:21.860]  broken up in 1980 or whatever. It's got to be done right now. Microsoft was never anything like this.
[2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:27.860]  They're watching you there, listening to you there. They have surveillance capitalism as it's
[2:35:27.860 --> 2:35:35.380]  called. And now they're banning Bible verses. Facebook's now saying that say that humans are
[2:35:35.380 --> 2:35:41.220]  inherently falling. They say that's to say that men are inherently evil. Whether that's true or not,
[2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:46.260]  it's not hate speech. It's your right. But they define speech as hate. Blumenthal says my speech
[2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:51.140]  isn't speech. It's incitement to violence to Robbie Parker have never even really talked about.
[2:35:51.860 --> 2:35:54.420]  But even if I said those things about Robbie Parker, I'm a right.
[2:35:54.420 --> 2:36:01.220]  So this is affecting everybody. Here's the article Google exec says info wars and Alex Jones will
[2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:07.860]  soon be unsearchable on YouTube. They've not just taken our sights down. They've not just banned
[2:36:07.860 --> 2:36:12.900]  our videos and only let negative stuff. He says in this, it was eight hours of it. I watched hours
[2:36:12.900 --> 2:36:16.340]  of it yesterday. I stayed up here late ruined a lot of my day. I didn't get a lot of stuff done.
[2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:21.940]  I can't even they're having hearings every week where they talk about me. I go to these things.
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:26.980]  And they have police come stand on both sides of me, even though I've never disrupted any of
[2:36:26.980 --> 2:36:35.700]  these meetings. And they go, he's here with his lies. I'm in a basic court and I never get to be
[2:36:37.620 --> 2:36:41.620]  examined cross examined. I don't get an opening statement. I don't get a final statement. I
[2:36:41.620 --> 2:36:47.780]  don't get SH. You know what T that means you don't get it either. Well, you know what? I'm
[2:36:47.780 --> 2:36:51.940]  on a helm there. I think I'm going to get a condo in DC and we're going to actually set up a DC
[2:36:51.940 --> 2:36:56.100]  bureau for real. I'm going to start living there two weeks out of the month. I don't want to be,
[2:36:56.100 --> 2:37:00.260]  but man, I'm going to be on your ass. Those committee hearings until I get my day in court. Well,
[2:37:01.540 --> 2:37:06.100]  Norm Pattis, it's a famous constitutional lawyer, very well known, famous criminal lawyers want a
[2:37:06.100 --> 2:37:11.060]  huge custody battle against the Russian oligarch. So this is only a Russian connection.
[2:37:11.060 --> 2:37:18.100]  Norm Pattis, how Senator Blumenthal uses Alex Jones to silence debate. And man,
[2:37:18.100 --> 2:37:23.540]  you talk about fascism. You talk about a danger. Blumenthal admits his son and a former U.S.
[2:37:23.540 --> 2:37:28.580]  attorney are quarterbacking this like I'm order organized crime. And he says he wants me shut
[2:37:28.580 --> 2:37:35.540]  down. How do I get a fair trial? And you've seen what they've done to us. You've seen how they
[2:37:35.540 --> 2:37:41.620]  operate. This is a hit squad. They admit to take me out in their own words. Norm Pattis joins us
[2:37:41.620 --> 2:37:46.100]  over the phone. We'll play some of the Blumenthal clip. It's posted in the article on infowars.com.
[2:37:46.100 --> 2:37:52.340]  We're going to post this full letter that the New Hampshire Register did publish
[2:37:54.340 --> 2:37:57.460]  using the New York Times. Everybody else just won't even publish his letters, but they did
[2:37:57.460 --> 2:38:04.580]  respond because I'm conscious. Imagine you're in committee hearing rooms with Jack Dorsey and
[2:38:04.580 --> 2:38:09.380]  Sundar Pichai and they're talking about you. Sometimes four or five senators, three or four
[2:38:09.380 --> 2:38:14.180]  Congress people will sit there and point at me and go, he's the one that said nobody died at Aurora.
[2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:19.460]  I never said that to the police stood down. It was true. They go, he's the liar. And I just
[2:38:19.460 --> 2:38:24.740]  sit there and can't respond. That is so un-American. So Norm Pattis, thank you for joining us. I know
[2:38:24.740 --> 2:38:28.420]  when I see this video yesterday, you were infuriated, you stayed up, you wrote this letter,
[2:38:28.420 --> 2:38:33.940]  you're asking them to put this in the public record at least. And hopefully we can lobby and
[2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:38.180]  you and I can testify to Congress. I'll be very polite. I'll be very nice. I don't know why they're
[2:38:38.180 --> 2:38:42.980]  so scared of letting me face my accusers. Since when do they do this to everybody? And we don't
[2:38:42.980 --> 2:38:47.940]  get to be in these committee hearings where we're the main character. Well, I mean, you know,
[2:38:47.940 --> 2:38:52.660]  if a Senate can do what it wants and it has no procedures, it's, you know, it's often said we
[2:38:52.660 --> 2:38:58.020]  get the government we deserve. I think we deserve a whole hell of a lot better than that. So we did
[2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:01.940]  write to Senator Grassley today, the chairman of the committee to complain about movement
[2:39:01.940 --> 2:39:06.740]  calls conduct. I don't expect for a moment that he'll upgrade movement call, but I do expect
[2:39:06.740 --> 2:39:11.380]  that you or I or someone on your behalf will get an invitation to come and speak to that.
[2:39:11.380 --> 2:39:17.060]  When a senator in the United States Senate and a former attorney general for the state of the
[2:39:17.060 --> 2:39:21.060]  state of Connecticut, a state can sit in the well of the court and demand that a social
[2:39:21.060 --> 2:39:26.660]  media company that it take down someone's speech based on misrepresentations, that is close to
[2:39:26.660 --> 2:39:31.460]  fascism. That's frightening and it should have people up in arms. So I, you know, I'm hoping
[2:39:31.460 --> 2:39:36.740]  that we'll get a response from Grassley. The new Haven Register was kind enough to print immediately
[2:39:37.380 --> 2:39:41.940]  something that we wrote about your case. And I think they did so because they realized that you
[2:39:41.940 --> 2:39:47.220]  don't have to agree with someone to support their right to speak freely. And, you know, in the United
[2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:52.980]  States we've cherished debate as a matter of what holds us together as a people. And we've decided
[2:39:52.980 --> 2:39:57.220]  that the anecdote to speech we don't like is more speech. You want to tell me something I don't know,
[2:39:57.220 --> 2:40:01.860]  tell me. And debate me, persuade me. If you can't persuade me, move on to the next person.
[2:40:01.860 --> 2:40:07.300]  That's what this country is about. It's not stiff arms in a Senate chamber by a guy who thinks that
[2:40:07.300 --> 2:40:12.740]  he speaks to God directly and the rest of us are unworthy. So, you know, I'm, I'll be curious to
[2:40:12.740 --> 2:40:17.060]  see what sort of response we get from Grassley. The letter went out a couple hours ago. Yeah,
[2:40:17.060 --> 2:40:21.140]  haven't heard anything yet. I wouldn't expect to. But I do hope you get an invitation to go down
[2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:28.180]  and address them. I think they're overdue. You're overdue. Well, for those that haven't been paying
[2:40:28.180 --> 2:40:34.020]  attention, most have. This is unprecedented, the things that Blumenthal says. He just says,
[2:40:34.020 --> 2:40:38.660]  I want the algorithms and AI to shut him down. I don't want him to ever be able to be on the
[2:40:38.660 --> 2:40:42.420]  Internet again. And they say, no, sir, we're going to have that. And they have stuff working,
[2:40:42.420 --> 2:40:47.220]  blocking my face, my name. Facebook's already doing it. So they want to unperson me so he can
[2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:51.540]  sit up there and lie about me all day. I mean, why do you think they're out to get me so bad?
[2:40:52.980 --> 2:40:57.460]  You know, you told me a long time ago that you thought it might have been related to the
[2:40:57.460 --> 2:41:01.940]  electoral cycles. And I just listened and I thought, well, you know, everybody says Alex,
[2:41:01.940 --> 2:41:06.340]  is it conspiracy theorist? Maybe this is an example. But the more I've gotten to learn about
[2:41:06.340 --> 2:41:11.620]  your case, that's the only explanation that I can discern. You can't tackle Facebook. It's too
[2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:17.540]  big and it's got information probably on everybody. You can't tackle Google's same analysis, but you're
[2:41:17.540 --> 2:41:23.300]  smaller and expendable. And I think that plenty of people think social media tilted the scales in
[2:41:23.300 --> 2:41:29.220]  2019, largely through Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, and that there's an effort going on
[2:41:29.220 --> 2:41:35.700]  prior to 2020 to silence the right on the theory that a divided and silenced right can more easily
[2:41:35.700 --> 2:41:42.660]  be conquered. So I view all of this as foreplay for the 2020 election, which makes it all the
[2:41:42.660 --> 2:41:48.260]  more alarming to me. I mean, the fact is Donald Trump, love him or not, won the election.
[2:41:49.380 --> 2:41:55.220]  You know, whether it was fair, you know, that's a topic for 2020 and a topic for investigation.
[2:41:55.220 --> 2:42:00.580]  But the notion that these Senate should be free to bully some social media companies
[2:42:00.580 --> 2:42:05.220]  and the silencing people because the members of the Senate don't like what they say,
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:10.420]  that's not my country. That's, you know, although I'm from Connecticut, he's not my senator.
[2:42:11.300 --> 2:42:14.340]  So, you know, I'm with you a hundred percent, Alex. It's very, very chilling.
[2:42:14.980 --> 2:42:17.620]  Well, you've given me the whole backstory and I looked into it. It's incredible.
[2:42:18.340 --> 2:42:23.300]  Senator Murphy, Senator Blumenthal, all of them live off Sandy Hook. They get elected off of it.
[2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:28.660]  It's like a religion. Everyone's sick of hearing it. Even your own papers are like shut up. I mean,
[2:42:28.660 --> 2:42:33.460]  it's all they do. It's like they were these nobodies and still are nobodies. And they think
[2:42:33.460 --> 2:42:37.380]  it's how you get on the news. And they're just, it's like, do what I say, Sandy Hook,
[2:42:37.380 --> 2:42:42.020]  give me your money, Sandy Hook, give me your guns, bankrupt Revington, Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook,
[2:42:42.020 --> 2:42:46.100]  polygonic crackers, polygonic crackers, take Alex Jones off the Internet. He hurt,
[2:42:46.100 --> 2:42:50.580]  he hurting children. And in Google, like, we know he's hurting them right now. Yes,

[2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:06.100]  is a self fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by
[2:44:06.100 --> 2:44:11.220]  people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another. It is the only independent
[2:44:11.220 --> 2:44:16.740]  press of this size and scale of this public reach. It is the one model that says here's a
[2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:21.780]  way to have a self supporting, self sustaining, self structured, little d democratic structure
[2:44:21.780 --> 2:44:25.860]  that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines
[2:44:25.860 --> 2:44:29.780]  what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars. And it's
[2:44:29.780 --> 2:44:34.900]  all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products
[2:44:34.900 --> 2:44:38.820]  that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the
[2:44:38.820 --> 2:44:44.180]  ability to do that. And at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience
[2:44:44.180 --> 2:44:48.580]  choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American
[2:44:48.580 --> 2:44:53.300]  democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with
[2:44:53.300 --> 2:45:03.700]  free markets. We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, cross the cotton, harness science,
[2:45:04.260 --> 2:45:12.500]  took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget that we are Americans
[2:45:12.500 --> 2:45:24.500]  and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free.
[2:45:25.140 --> 2:45:34.580]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. We all share the same heroes,
[2:45:34.580 --> 2:45:42.980]  the same home, the same heart and we are all made by the same almighty God.
[2:46:04.580 --> 2:46:10.580]  And the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being
[2:46:10.580 --> 2:46:18.020]  challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who
[2:46:18.020 --> 2:46:24.740]  are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be
[2:46:24.740 --> 2:46:31.780]  gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days. Having storable foods and
[2:46:31.780 --> 2:46:38.020]  the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level and being without
[2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:44.500]  puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system. Buy storable foods
[2:46:44.500 --> 2:46:51.860]  and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today. Support mankind by being prepared and support
[2:46:51.860 --> 2:47:01.620]  freedom by buying from infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:12.260 --> 2:47:16.340]  I was just talking to one of our long-time great crew members, great cameraman, great
[2:47:16.340 --> 2:47:22.420]  switcher, great editor, Marcos Morales. And I said, man, this is getting crazy. He goes,
[2:47:22.420 --> 2:47:29.060]  what it is, it's fascism. And that's what it is. All day we hear about concentration camps
[2:47:29.060 --> 2:47:34.180]  and Nazis and how much we suck we're most diverse country in the world with some of the most
[2:47:34.900 --> 2:47:43.060]  greatest opportunities ever. And Chris Pratt can't wear a American flag shirt and he's called a white
[2:47:43.060 --> 2:47:50.260]  supremacist on the front page of Yahoo. I mean, that's what you do when you demoralize the people
[2:47:50.260 --> 2:47:57.940]  is you make them hate themselves. Get crazy. That's because the left are not liberals like Thomas
[2:47:57.940 --> 2:48:05.620]  Jefferson. They're fascist and fascism is banning Bible verses. Fascism is suppressing people's
[2:48:05.620 --> 2:48:13.380]  speech. Fascism is Blumenthal. We're about to play. Coldly, they looked all freaked out like a James
[2:48:13.380 --> 2:48:20.260]  Bond villain and the guy just wreaks power trip. He talking about how I need to be silenced because
[2:48:20.260 --> 2:48:26.020]  I'm harassing families and I'm doing all these things that aren't even true. But what they do is
[2:48:26.740 --> 2:48:32.900]  give a shot of that for me. Thanks. What they do is they let me zoom in on that just evil face.
[2:48:32.900 --> 2:48:36.580]  It's not just like one shot of him. He takes himself so seriously.
[2:48:38.420 --> 2:48:42.100]  And I know things aren't going the way he wants with all his fake lawsuits. He's really upset.
[2:48:42.100 --> 2:48:45.780]  We're going to be here in 2020. We're going to be here after that. Thanks to our listeners support.
[2:48:45.780 --> 2:48:51.220]  But going back to very successful, very famous legal top dog. There's a lot of lawyers out there,
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:57.140]  a lot of bad ones, but bad is a really smart guy. What would you quantify this as? What would you
[2:48:57.140 --> 2:49:02.420]  say this is? Because when I'm watching him sit up there and Senator Murphy say that I need to be
[2:49:02.420 --> 2:49:07.780]  taken off the air to save America. Close quote. I don't feel sad for myself. I'm like watching this
[2:49:08.500 --> 2:49:13.540]  and it's like all the movies about a fascist future. This is what you would see. It's just
[2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:22.340]  such a lie, but they're they're just doing it. I mean, every single day I see some of the nation
[2:49:22.340 --> 2:49:28.980]  coming apart at 50. Norm, give me a favor back. Norm, back off your phone a little bit. I think
[2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:35.460]  you got your mic muffled. Okay. Is this better? That's great. Go ahead. Yes. I see a nation divided
[2:49:35.460 --> 2:49:40.180]  and I see a nation afraid and I'm looking for leadership in public office and not doing it.
[2:49:40.900 --> 2:49:45.860]  Right now, everything is not about, is not about transport, it's about identity. Then
[2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:51.140]  is demographic change or dividing into tribes that don't hear a common language? The Democratic
[2:49:51.140 --> 2:49:55.380]  party is playing the identity card yet again, probably going to deliver the election to Donald
[2:49:55.380 --> 2:50:02.740]  Trump and Trump is playing identity as well. Basically, when we called out for Congresswoman,
[2:50:02.740 --> 2:50:08.100]  you know, now there are calls for these people to say anything else. They're American, fine.
[2:50:08.100 --> 2:50:12.980]  They're as American as you are. But, you know, you or I don't help people. You're not entitled to
[2:50:12.980 --> 2:50:17.700]  something because of the color of your skin. We don't say that you owe me something because
[2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:24.500]  of the color of your skin. I think we're indulging in a very luxurious form of
[2:50:24.500 --> 2:50:29.780]  blackouts in this country and the absence of common principles with pluralism having run
[2:50:29.780 --> 2:50:35.540]  about all the United States now is dealing with. So the biggest victim in the room is the person
[2:50:35.540 --> 2:50:41.220]  who's got moral freedom. Ruementhal is playing with his children and with his son-in-law.
[2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:44.980]  No, you're right. And we're going to work on your phone for a moment and play some of
[2:50:44.980 --> 2:50:48.820]  Ruementhal. Either we need to reconnect with him or he needs to back off the phone because
[2:50:48.820 --> 2:50:53.540]  it's coming in and out, guys. We should connect via audio Skype or something. But he's making
[2:50:53.540 --> 2:50:58.260]  some great points. Here is Ruementhal in some of his statements to the Google executive who
[2:50:58.260 --> 2:51:03.060]  promised, oh, will ban Alex Jones and a lot more. I mean, just totally eradicate me. Here it is.
[2:51:06.100 --> 2:51:13.700]  When Alex Jones and others use YouTube to quote, and I'm quoting him,
[2:51:14.340 --> 2:51:21.540]  regurgitate demonstrably and undeniably false information about the Sandy Hook shooting
[2:51:21.540 --> 2:51:28.740]  while simultaneously attacking victims' families for profit, end quote. These lies were...
[2:51:30.020 --> 2:51:38.580]  By the way, hit pause again. This guy that could literally play Count Dracula without any makeup,
[2:51:39.380 --> 2:51:40.980]  he looks like a reanimated corpse.
[2:51:43.940 --> 2:51:47.140]  He perches up there and says, I did this for profit.
[2:51:47.140 --> 2:51:55.940]  We got into the Google analytics. We've talked about Sandy Hook 0.2 percent. And that's with all the
[2:51:55.940 --> 2:52:01.700]  news coverage. I don't live Sandy Hook like you do. You're a Sandy Hook vampire. You live off those
[2:52:01.700 --> 2:52:07.540]  dead kids. You monster. You anti-American criminal. God almighty, you make me sick.
[2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:14.020]  You will be defeated, you authoritarian. You would widen and Murphy and all of you.
[2:52:14.020 --> 2:52:20.580]  You are the people that need an anti-corruption task force. You need to be investigated for
[2:52:20.580 --> 2:52:24.500]  racketeering. And don't worry, you are being investigated.
[2:52:27.940 --> 2:52:31.620]  He has a superiority complex. He thinks he's your God. You're not my God.
[2:52:32.260 --> 2:52:37.540]  You'll face God one day, don't you worry. But not at my hands. I wish no harm upon
[2:52:37.540 --> 2:52:45.620]  Blumenthal. Let's go ahead and now go back to him. More than just false, they were malicious.
[2:52:46.260 --> 2:52:52.980]  They were cruel. They incited harassment, physical threats. They forced this family literally every
[2:52:52.980 --> 2:53:02.020]  day to relive their laws. And as Robbie Parker told us last time, he was here for too long,
[2:53:02.020 --> 2:53:08.820]  Google and his peers were quote unquote complacent. And it paused again. They kept saying I was a
[2:53:08.820 --> 2:53:12.100]  Sandy Hook guy like three years ago. So I went, Hey, I think Sandy Hook happened. The public
[2:53:12.100 --> 2:53:15.700]  questioned it. We have a right to question it. I already said, I thought it happened. They go,
[2:53:15.700 --> 2:53:21.380]  Ah, you admit you were lying. And I went, No, your whole career is about this. No, yours is.
[2:53:22.260 --> 2:53:27.460]  It's about Blumenthal. And then now they just keep restating. But then he gets into how he
[2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:31.380]  to be silenced and how he be taken off the air and they agree they're going to do it. You've seen
[2:53:31.380 --> 2:53:39.060]  the full video. What do you make of this? No, that's dick being dick. I mean, I've been, I'm a
[2:53:39.060 --> 2:53:43.380]  Connecticut lawyer. I have been for a quarter of a century. I knew him when he was attorney general.
[2:53:43.380 --> 2:53:46.980]  I appeared with him in the United States Supreme Court. I appeared with him in courts throughout
[2:53:46.980 --> 2:53:54.500]  the state. He is a man without apparent qualities. He is sort of like a robot. He does what he thinks
[2:53:54.500 --> 2:53:58.180]  is going to keep him elected. And, you know, candidly, Alex, he's going to be elected for as
[2:53:58.180 --> 2:54:01.700]  long as he wants to be elected in Connecticut. Nobody's going to mount a credible challenge
[2:54:01.700 --> 2:54:06.580]  against him. I don't see it on the horizon. Well, that's why God gave us all expiration dates.
[2:54:07.700 --> 2:54:13.780]  Well, you know, that, that maybe, you know, but I mean, he is, he isn't, you know,
[2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:16.820]  I don't know if you ever read Robert Musil's book, Man Without Qualities. I mean, that's
[2:54:16.820 --> 2:54:21.700]  Blumenthal. I had a very interesting conference series of confrontations with him one year.
[2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:26.100]  I represented a man on death row. I was trying to get him an opportunity to attend his mother's
[2:54:26.100 --> 2:54:30.580]  funeral. And Blumenthal came in by limo to argue the motion. And I said, Judge, may I have a moment
[2:54:30.580 --> 2:54:34.340]  with the attorney general? I put my hand over the microphone and I said, you look, here's the thing,
[2:54:34.340 --> 2:54:37.940]  Dick, you read the brief on the way up here in a limo. You're here for a photo op. So,
[2:54:37.940 --> 2:54:43.140]  fuck you. And don't you know I'll be saying that, excuse my language. And then I said,
[2:54:43.140 --> 2:54:47.220]  thank you, Judge. He argued the case. I saw him a couple months later in the Supreme Court
[2:54:47.220 --> 2:54:51.940]  of the United States. He acted like it never happened. I bested him in a case involving a
[2:54:51.940 --> 2:54:57.140]  prisoner who was beaten for millions of dollars. The next time I saw him, it was as though I was
[2:54:57.140 --> 2:55:02.900]  his best friend. So you're saying the man is a sociopath. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
[2:55:02.900 --> 2:55:07.860]  there's no getting to the bottom of him. And with respect to Sandy Hook, you know, you're an easy
[2:55:07.860 --> 2:55:12.820]  target in Connecticut right now. But I think that's beginning to change. You know, we've been
[2:55:12.820 --> 2:55:16.500]  litigating your case and talking about it quite a bit in the Connecticut courts. And people are
[2:55:16.500 --> 2:55:21.140]  coming up saying, what's this stuff going to stop? These shootings are seven years old already. At
[2:55:21.140 --> 2:55:24.180]  some point, the Republicans... By the way, I don't want to talk about myself, but they're always
[2:55:24.180 --> 2:55:27.940]  claiming I'm the sociopath. I'm this evil guy. I'm fake. The truth is, this is the complete
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:31.940]  opposite. You're a pretty good judge of character. You really poked around here and didn't believe
[2:55:31.940 --> 2:55:35.620]  me. And I kind of got irritated by it, but you spent a lot of time. You've dug through everything
[2:55:35.620 --> 2:55:39.460]  here. How would you tell the audience, what is him for wars? And who is Alex Jones?
[2:55:40.500 --> 2:55:43.940]  Well, you're right about that. And I mean, I'm not going to repeat our communications. I know I
[2:55:43.940 --> 2:55:47.300]  did get you pissed. And I thought you were going to fire me at one point, but I didn't believe
[2:55:47.300 --> 2:55:51.380]  anything that I saw. And I spent probably two weeks there. I've talked to everybody in the
[2:55:51.380 --> 2:55:57.220]  place that would talk to me, which is everyone. What you see is what you get. There is no master
[2:55:57.220 --> 2:56:02.660]  conspiracy. When I hear a story about Alex Jones' conspiracy theory, no, I think you should be
[2:56:02.660 --> 2:56:09.780]  rebranded as Alex Jones, an authentic, angry American. It's not hatred of things. It's things
[2:56:09.780 --> 2:56:14.260]  you fear and what you think is becoming this country. I don't want info wars shut down.
[2:56:14.260 --> 2:56:19.620]  You've got a bunch of very strong, independent, minded people working there. I don't always
[2:56:19.620 --> 2:56:24.340]  agree with what I hear, but I don't have to. You don't exist to suit me or anyone else. You speak
[2:56:24.340 --> 2:56:29.620]  the truth as you see it and take the consequences as they fall. I think all you demand is a fair
[2:56:29.620 --> 2:56:33.620]  fight. And when the United States Senate is stacked against you or the court's theme
[2:56:33.620 --> 2:56:38.020]  unenclined to hear you, then you got to roll up your sleeves and push back hard.
[2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:41.540]  That was my next question. That was my next question. And we'll do five more minutes and
[2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:46.180]  all you got to go. My cabs is coming up. It's not going well. A lot of their cases, judges
[2:56:46.180 --> 2:56:50.740]  are having special hearings, Supreme Court hearings, public interest things that are unheard of,
[2:56:50.740 --> 2:56:55.780]  because I think the courts are discovering the narratives they've brought in are almost completely
[2:56:55.780 --> 2:57:02.420]  lies. Well, and what's more, and when they're not lies, they just don't matter. The fact that the
[2:57:02.420 --> 2:57:07.060]  matter is we've always had the freedom to speak only and provocatively in this country. If we
[2:57:07.060 --> 2:57:12.580]  didn't, we'd be drinking British tea right now and celebrating British holidays. This country has
[2:57:12.580 --> 2:57:17.380]  been about angry defiance. This country has been about people speaking the truth as they see it.
[2:57:17.380 --> 2:57:21.460]  And our courts have traditionally stood behind that. I think they'll come around and stand behind
[2:57:21.460 --> 2:57:25.220]  you. It's going to take a little more work, but we're well on the way to get being where you need
[2:57:25.220 --> 2:57:29.380]  to be absolutely. And thanks for the listeners. We were having to hang tough through this. It's
[2:57:29.380 --> 2:57:33.860]  a fight, but we're getting stronger. Thanks to you literally holding us up. I am in your hands.
[2:57:33.860 --> 2:57:37.060]  It is the final day I said yesterday was, but I've been too busy to do new specials.
[2:57:37.060 --> 2:57:43.380]  The 1776 special has to end today. 1776 on the apparel, 75 to 25% off-store wide.
[2:57:44.820 --> 2:57:47.620]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:57:47.620 --> 2:57:52.260]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here
[2:57:52.260 --> 2:57:57.060]  out in New York City. And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[2:57:57.060 --> 2:58:01.540]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[2:58:01.540 --> 2:58:05.860]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public. The approaching
[2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:10.180]  2020. That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only
[2:58:10.180 --> 2:58:13.460]  way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying,
[2:58:13.460 --> 2:58:17.140]  my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[2:58:17.140 --> 2:58:22.100]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you on air until
[2:58:22.100 --> 2:58:25.700]  you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80. But if they
[2:58:25.700 --> 2:58:31.220]  do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot
[2:58:31.220 --> 2:58:35.300]  of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. We're going to keep fighting in
[2:58:35.300 --> 2:58:40.100]  the info war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've
[2:58:40.100 --> 2:58:43.700]  gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you, sir, for calling
[2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:54.020]  info wars, the most banned network in the world, yours and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it
[2:58:54.020 --> 2:58:59.220]  wasn't for you. And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen. But I wanted to take just
[2:58:59.220 --> 2:59:03.940]  a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw
[2:59:03.940 --> 2:59:08.260]  those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were
[2:59:08.260 --> 2:59:12.580]  liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth. And so I feel very strong and I feel
[2:59:12.580 --> 2:59:16.420]  God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart. And I want you to know that love is
[2:59:16.420 --> 2:59:20.420]  right back at you. And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your
[2:59:20.420 --> 2:59:25.140]  prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[2:59:25.140 --> 2:59:29.620]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun. But that's not what's
[2:59:29.620 --> 2:59:34.820]  important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God.
[2:59:34.820 --> 2:59:39.060]  You're being used by God. This is Providence. So I salute you and I thank you for all you've
[2:59:39.060 --> 3:00:02.660]  done from the bottom of my heart. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Again, folks, I don't want
[3:00:02.660 --> 3:00:08.180]  to get up here and say I'm for real. Talk about myself. The whole media keeps trying to say I'm
[3:00:08.180 --> 3:00:15.700]  this lie. I'm this fraud. And, you know, people believe this stuff. I mean, I let Norm into our
[3:00:15.700 --> 3:00:20.020]  bank accounts, let him into everything. There's no Russian money. There's no Mercer money.
[3:00:20.020 --> 3:00:26.340]  There's none of this stuff. It's you, the people. We're real. And they can't believe that we're real.
[3:00:26.340 --> 3:00:30.980]  And, you know, I ended up staying up here late last night to watch the hearing and went on for
[3:00:30.980 --> 3:00:37.860]  like six hours over an eight hour period. They took a break and they, I was brought up over and over
[3:00:37.860 --> 3:00:41.940]  again with incredible lies and they admitted how they're going to censor everybody. They've got AI
[3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:47.140]  to come in and you're listening to this. They're the fascists. They're the danger. And he sits there
[3:00:47.140 --> 3:00:52.500]  with a straight face. Just other points in closing, Norm Patis. How do you see this ending?
[3:00:52.500 --> 3:00:57.860]  Where is this going? How bad is this going to get? That's a great question. I mean, you know,
[3:00:57.860 --> 3:01:01.940]  I'm a lawyer, so I always think in terms of legal remedies, I've been urging you to consider actions
[3:01:01.940 --> 3:01:06.420]  against Facebook and Google. Those would be difficult and expensive and perhaps not winnable
[3:01:06.420 --> 3:01:12.500]  under current law. In our letter to Senator Grassley this morning, we asked for an opportunity to
[3:01:12.500 --> 3:01:17.380]  talk about amendments to the Communications Decency Act to require that these things,
[3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:22.020]  these massive social media companies, do not censor in exchange for their immunity from
[3:01:22.020 --> 3:01:26.740]  suit for publication of items. So I think there's going to be a legislative or legal challenge.
[3:01:26.740 --> 3:01:32.420]  If it doesn't end and they end up silencing people by fiat, these things historically never end
[3:01:32.420 --> 3:01:36.660]  well. And, you know, then the people are going to have to decide whether this is the government
[3:01:36.660 --> 3:01:41.860]  they want and deserve. Thomas Jefferson said, a revolution every generation or so was necessary.
[3:01:41.860 --> 3:01:46.580]  I don't know if we live in those times. Some part of me wishes we do. Some part of me fears we must.
[3:01:47.140 --> 3:01:52.580]  So I'm very apprehensive about what the future holds. I know that you're concerned about the
[3:01:52.580 --> 3:01:57.140]  attacks on you and I know how much they weigh on you. When we talk, I can feel the sorrow and
[3:01:57.140 --> 3:02:02.020]  the grief and the anger. I just encourage you to keep fighting and your listeners to keep fighting
[3:02:02.020 --> 3:02:07.860]  with you because it's an important fight. If you let the self-righteous win and tell you
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:13.140]  what you can think, what you can decide, what you can do, that's just not liberty.
[3:02:13.140 --> 3:02:18.500]  I want the freedom to be wrong, even gloriously wrong. I don't want to live at the other end
[3:02:18.500 --> 3:02:24.420]  of what Senator Blumenthal thinks is correct. That's a humorless leash to wear and I refuse to wear it.
[3:02:24.980 --> 3:02:31.620]  He did seem, once said, defeated and really upset when he was speaking. And I think you
[3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:35.460]  said last night you picked up on some of that too. I don't think things are going the way they
[3:02:35.460 --> 3:02:40.820]  thought, just in general. Well, I think in part the problem is bigger than politics. You know,
[3:02:41.380 --> 3:02:46.180]  it's the big other. It's the problem is Shoshana Zuboff talks about in the age of surveillance
[3:02:46.180 --> 3:02:51.300]  capitalism. We have created these giant algorithms and now they're beginning to tell us what we can
[3:02:51.300 --> 3:02:57.540]  and can't do. I mean, for example, I've watched a close person of an associate of mine struggle with
[3:02:58.180 --> 3:03:03.540]  Airbnb. It used to be that that was a welcoming place to go and make a little money on a part-time
[3:03:03.540 --> 3:03:07.540]  rental. Now they're telling you what you can and can't do. And if you fight them, they make your
[3:03:07.540 --> 3:03:12.820]  life endlessly difficult and give you bad ratings. Who's governing? We are the machine. One way of
[3:03:12.820 --> 3:03:16.980]  looking at what Blumenwald was saying yesterday is he's reaching the conclusion that the machines
[3:03:16.980 --> 3:03:22.100]  are beginning to take the role of human judgment and they're telling us what we can and can't do.
[3:03:22.100 --> 3:03:27.220]  That would be too fast-file. The fact of the matter is there are humans creating these algorithms
[3:03:27.220 --> 3:03:33.700]  and even Google acknowledges that humans supplement their censorship efforts. So from my perspective,
[3:03:33.700 --> 3:03:40.340]  the aim is simple. Make Google respond to First Amendment pressure. Do not permit Google, Facebook
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:45.620]  or the other social media to engage in content-based censorship. No, you're absolutely right. And
[3:03:45.620 --> 3:03:49.060]  you know, I understand that maybe Blumenwald is more like a machine so he doesn't care if it's
[3:03:49.060 --> 3:03:54.260]  soulless. But why don't these elites get jealous of machine power instead of always trying to
[3:03:54.260 --> 3:03:59.300]  dominate other humans? Why don't they become pro-human? I think because many of them are
[3:03:59.300 --> 3:04:04.260]  eating off the machine's welfare, you know, as Zuboff points out, it's not as though the machines
[3:04:04.260 --> 3:04:09.460]  are in absolute control yet. They're still a tiny elite. Call it the 1% of the 1% that's
[3:04:09.460 --> 3:04:14.420]  skimming the cream. You know, Mark Zuckerberg spent $22 million a year before last month's
[3:04:14.420 --> 3:04:19.460]  security. Think about that. That's in one year, $22 million to keep him safe. To keep him safe
[3:04:19.460 --> 3:04:24.820]  from who? From us, perhaps, because we're beginning to see what he's doing to us and what those
[3:04:24.820 --> 3:04:29.140]  machines are doing to us in the name of profits for an ever smaller number of people. Oh yeah,
[3:04:29.140 --> 3:04:33.860]  all these big tech heads are building underground bunkers in New Zealand and Tasmanian. They're all,
[3:04:33.860 --> 3:04:37.460]  they know something scary because they're projecting onto the world their own evil.
[3:04:37.460 --> 3:04:41.780]  Norm Patys, you're amazing. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you for having me, Alice. Bye.
[3:04:41.780 --> 3:04:45.140]  All right, Mike Adams is coming up, but I got a couple more things I need to hit
[3:04:45.140 --> 3:04:48.260]  that are really important that I didn't get to on the other side. Please stay with us.
[3:04:54.420 --> 3:04:58.500]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies,
[3:04:58.500 --> 3:05:02.500]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political,
[3:05:02.500 --> 3:05:06.500]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades. And because of that, that's why the
[3:05:06.500 --> 3:05:10.420]  courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[3:05:10.420 --> 3:05:13.940]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real
[3:05:13.940 --> 3:05:18.020]  social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never
[3:05:18.020 --> 3:05:22.500]  change, and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century,
[3:05:22.500 --> 3:05:26.820]  who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[3:05:26.820 --> 3:05:31.700]  recover after the Great Depression. The infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of
[3:05:31.700 --> 3:05:36.820]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the
[3:05:36.820 --> 3:05:41.700]  original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating
[3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:45.620]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts,
[3:05:45.620 --> 3:05:49.380]  and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of
[3:05:49.380 --> 3:05:53.540]  gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[3:05:53.540 --> 3:06:03.540]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:14.500 --> 3:06:17.780]  Well, Mike Adams is one of the most popular co-hosts here. He's taken over here in just a
[3:06:17.780 --> 3:06:22.340]  few minutes. A bunch of news I didn't get to. I did cover it down today. I meant to go to calls,
[3:06:22.340 --> 3:06:29.460]  but things are just getting insane. CNN and others are calling transgender facility a concentration
[3:06:29.460 --> 3:06:34.580]  camp. Yeah, there's so many transgenders in Latin America. I guess that's really the birthplace of
[3:06:34.580 --> 3:06:41.220]  it all that they have to have their own facilities. And in the videos, it teaches them how to be sex
[3:06:41.220 --> 3:06:47.380]  here to get men. Well, guess what? That's a concentration camp. ICE detention center teaches
[3:06:47.380 --> 3:06:53.220]  transgender migrants how to look feminine. They get their nails done, their hair done. They again
[3:06:53.220 --> 3:06:58.180]  have a sand volleyball court. I didn't have that in high school. I like playing volleyball with
[3:06:58.180 --> 3:07:02.980]  the girls sometimes. It's always great when I pick a girlfriend up, but we didn't have sand.
[3:07:03.780 --> 3:07:11.780]  They've got full basketball courts, and of course they have full soccer fields and
[3:07:11.780 --> 3:07:17.700]  and basket weaving for the few weeks they're there. And but now among the ICE detention
[3:07:17.700 --> 3:07:21.300]  centers, democratic leaders are calling concentration camps as a unit described specifically for
[3:07:21.300 --> 3:07:30.340]  transgender migrants. Or again, they're they're taught classes in cosmology. God almighty.
[3:07:31.780 --> 3:07:37.860]  God almighty. It's just there's no end to it. You know, I mentioned this earlier, but I want to
[3:07:37.860 --> 3:07:42.980]  pull it up and show TV viewers on screen. Paul Joseph Watson article that's on news wars.com
[3:07:42.980 --> 3:07:47.620]  and info wars.com. And remember, we're blocked in the algorithm everywhere, but you the human element
[3:07:48.500 --> 3:07:52.740]  can tell Zuckerberg can tell Sundar Pichai, Hey, I'm going to share this on my email. I'm going to
[3:07:52.740 --> 3:07:56.420]  share this on my text. I'm going to word of mouth say, Hey, did you see the New York Times and
[3:07:56.420 --> 3:08:02.900]  Washington Post all put down the Apollo program because it was men. So my God, the great wall
[3:08:02.900 --> 3:08:09.300]  of China got built by men. It's bad too. This is insane. Only aliens would come here and teach
[3:08:09.300 --> 3:08:16.740]  us to hate our species like this. This is how you would tear a planet apart. And I don't cover UFOs
[3:08:16.740 --> 3:08:21.300]  very 51. I'm just saying this looks like what an alien would do. Every attack our families,
[3:08:21.300 --> 3:08:25.780]  attack our genders, attack our DNA, attack our entire system, attack our atmosphere.
[3:08:27.140 --> 3:08:30.100]  Oh, and then the Bible says it's a fallen entity on the planet wants to kill us all.
[3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:35.380]  And every other culture and ancient says that it's there's something evil on the planet wants to
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:42.100]  destroy us. Maybe it's psychotics get together and there's some group collective mind meld.
[3:08:42.100 --> 3:08:47.380]  I don't know. We know there's a group consciousness. All I know is it's real.
[3:08:48.420 --> 3:08:54.740]  An establishment is into it. Washington Post, the New York Times tried to ruin the Apollo
[3:08:54.740 --> 3:08:59.780]  moon landing anniversary with woke identity politics. Let's put this on screen for TV viewers,
[3:08:59.780 --> 3:09:09.060]  please. And you go through it and it's all of these photos and all of these reports about oh,
[3:09:09.060 --> 3:09:19.540]  look, there were no women and it's men and it's a bad thing. And then folks tweeted in there
[3:09:19.540 --> 3:09:29.700]  that oh, look at these men too. Yeah, look at these evil men. Let's let's click on that.
[3:09:30.660 --> 3:09:36.580]  And let's just look at those evil faces of all those men smiling.
[3:09:38.740 --> 3:09:46.740]  Minutes before they face thousands of pieces of German artillery and heavy machine guns and
[3:09:46.740 --> 3:09:52.100]  half of them were killed on the beaches that day. Look at those. Oh, I forgot. They're not just men.
[3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:59.460]  It's dirty white men. This is the left. This is what they've created. This is like some racist,
[3:09:59.460 --> 3:10:06.980]  twisted PCP twilight zone, one who flew over the cuckoo's nest, insane asylum. But just
[3:10:08.500 --> 3:10:13.620]  look at this crap. And I love that photo. If you go back, I looked at it for like five minutes this
[3:10:13.620 --> 3:10:19.140]  morning and blow that photo up if you can. Look at the looks on those guys faces. They're not just
[3:10:19.140 --> 3:10:26.980]  smiling like they're trying to act happy. A lot of them look like they're excited. A lot of them
[3:10:26.980 --> 3:10:36.260]  look like they're having a good time. A lot of them look serious. And I even looked at when that
[3:10:36.260 --> 3:10:40.740]  photo was taken. Those those are guys on like the fourth wave knowing half the people getting off
[3:10:40.740 --> 3:10:46.660]  are dead and they're ready. You think men are like that today on average? I'm going to ask you a
[3:10:46.660 --> 3:10:51.780]  question. You go round up men in your tits, black, white, whatever they are. You think you load them
[3:10:51.780 --> 3:10:57.140]  on a troop carrier and they're going in to face hundreds of thousands of German troops and half
[3:10:57.140 --> 3:11:02.020]  of you are going to die before you get up the hills. You're all going to be half the people
[3:11:02.020 --> 3:11:06.900]  you're in there are going to be dead in 20 minutes. Another third or so we're going to have bullet holes
[3:11:06.900 --> 3:11:14.980]  in you. And you're watching troop carriers blow up in front of you that have shells mortar shells
[3:11:14.980 --> 3:11:19.300]  and artillery shells going into them. You're watching dead bodies all over the beach and you're
[3:11:19.300 --> 3:11:33.940]  smiling. And you look how men are today. I played that clip of that soulless peacock earlier with
[3:11:33.940 --> 3:11:40.420]  that woman. The top newscaster is out there in Phoenix. She's got a parlor account, not even
[3:11:40.420 --> 3:11:44.820]  right wing. And he's like, oh, the boss wants you to take that down. You might be called extremist.
[3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:52.900]  She goes, I'm reaching people. He's like, I'm just saying people are pretty upset and concerned.
[3:11:52.900 --> 3:11:59.460]  You're going to never know you're a Republican. See? Oh, can't have that American flag on.
[3:11:59.460 --> 3:12:08.020]  Chris Pratt. Oh, it's an act of courage that Chris Pratt is a Christian admits he's a Christian.
[3:12:08.740 --> 3:12:12.420]  They've called for him to denounce Trump and he won't do it. And now he said, don't tread on the
[3:12:12.420 --> 3:12:20.900]  American flag. What a, what a, what a, what a, what a hero. But in 2019, I guess that's heroic,
[3:12:20.900 --> 3:12:25.380]  right? I guess it is. By the way, we sold out and it takes a lot of money to fund this operation.
[3:12:25.380 --> 3:12:30.020]  So thanks for buying 4,000 shirts, but make like $5 a piece when we discounted them. The
[3:12:30.020 --> 3:12:33.940]  fabric's nice. The printing's nice of that Betsy Ross flag that said these colors don't run. It
[3:12:33.940 --> 3:12:38.660]  was so popular. We're bringing another one back tomorrow, another limited edition. It'll be different
[3:12:38.660 --> 3:12:43.380]  colors, a little bit different setup, but I already had one in the pike. I already told him to design
[3:12:43.380 --> 3:12:52.100]  it last week. The Betsy Ross flag with don't tread on me and the Gadston snake and the graphics
[3:12:52.100 --> 3:12:58.660]  people in temporary J were blown away. They're like, Hey, look, look at this. And I noticed
[3:12:58.660 --> 3:13:03.700]  it too. Chris Pratt's wearing a shirt just like Navy blue. Same because it's just common sense,
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:08.580]  folks. Maybe his is black, ours, the Navy blue. I guess Navy blue. So I literally envision the
[3:13:08.580 --> 3:13:14.500]  same shirt because it makes sense says America's back and forwards.com. The back 4,000 are being
[3:13:14.500 --> 3:13:18.740]  printed now. Two days ago, the Betsy Ross ones arrived. They're already shipping out.
[3:13:18.740 --> 3:13:23.860]  And that's how you support the broadcast and all the crew and what we're doing and then the fights
[3:13:23.860 --> 3:13:29.780]  were engaged in and I have to expand the 1776 sale. I don't go up with the new sales yet.
[3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:33.380]  This was one we were developing last week. We just launched this morning for the shirt.
[3:13:33.380 --> 3:13:38.980]  Our new sales are new specials aren't ready. I'm so busy. I barely cut ads, but 75 to 25% off store
[3:13:38.980 --> 3:13:46.260]  wide and 1776 for all apparel that includes the new Chris Pratt inspired shirt. Once I wrote that
[3:13:46.260 --> 3:13:49.860]  headline, it's not really accurate because I already had the idea. I mean, why not say don't
[3:13:49.860 --> 3:13:53.540]  cred on me. They're treading the American flag and combine the two. It's just common sense.
[3:13:54.340 --> 3:14:00.180]  It's like, why didn't somebody stick flamed, broiled beef and cheese and onions and lettuce
[3:14:00.180 --> 3:14:04.980]  and tomato on a bun before the guy invented it? The world's fair or whatever. I forget the 20s.
[3:14:05.700 --> 3:14:10.740]  Looks like the hamburger just got invented in the 20s. But the point is, is that it's just
[3:14:10.740 --> 3:14:14.980]  a common sense thing. Don't credit on me combined with the flag. The shirts limited edition,
[3:14:14.980 --> 3:14:20.340]  info or store.com. And like I said, the other shirts sold out, but Betsy Ross is so popular.
[3:14:20.340 --> 3:14:24.420]  Limbaugh's got one now too. Cause everybody agrees. Hey, the American flag is not evil.
[3:14:24.420 --> 3:14:28.740]  Okay. And so we're going to have a new design of that out for those that are chomping at the
[3:14:28.740 --> 3:14:31.380]  bit. A lot of requests will have that for you by tomorrow. But there's a, oh, by the way,
[3:14:31.380 --> 3:14:35.380]  one of the flags is a Betsy Ross one, the new Chris Pratt inspired. Don't try on me. One's a
[3:14:35.380 --> 3:14:39.380]  Betsy Ross. One's a regular record flag. So we do have a Betsy Ross flag. If you want that,
[3:14:39.380 --> 3:14:44.980]  and it triggers the left. They're all over top of Yahoo news, white supremacist, uh, you know,
[3:14:44.980 --> 3:14:50.820]  Chris Pratt. I want to see it. If I've never had a flag pull at my house, one's going in
[3:14:51.860 --> 3:14:55.860]  and a Betsy Ross, we're going to make Betsy Ross flags. I mean, because this is the hill
[3:14:55.860 --> 3:15:00.820]  I want to die on. We need, she was an abolitionist folks, a leading abolitionist on top of it.
[3:15:00.820 --> 3:15:05.940]  An anti-slaver from the countries and the Christian nations that banned it is who made it.
[3:15:05.940 --> 3:15:10.500]  It's so cool. The American flag was made by an abolitionist. It's just like the sick irony of
[3:15:10.500 --> 3:15:16.660]  that is so incredible. But whether it's the X two, which is about to sell out or brain force
[3:15:16.660 --> 3:15:21.300]  plus the bone broths getting ready, we're down to the last few kegs of that 1000 kegs of that.
[3:15:21.300 --> 3:15:28.340]  What else is selling out? Oh, ultra 12, twice as strong as secret 12 highest quality method
[3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:32.900]  of the bottom of that selling out won't be more for a few months. We're still keeping it at 1776
[3:15:32.900 --> 3:15:38.260]  in forward store.com. All right, Mike Adams is ready to go for three powerful segments
[3:15:38.260 --> 3:15:43.620]  straight ahead. We'll be right back, but we do have to apologize that men land on the moon.
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:50.100]  It's a horrible misogynistic thing. So I apologize for all the men of earth to the moon. We go moon.
[3:15:53.060 --> 3:15:57.300]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my

[3:17:51.140 --> 3:17:56.580]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[3:17:56.580 --> 3:18:00.740]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of
[3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:05.220]  people here out in New York City, and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[3:18:05.220 --> 3:18:09.700]  with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war
[3:18:09.700 --> 3:18:14.100]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public,
[3:18:14.100 --> 3:18:18.660]  the approaching 2020. That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:18:18.660 --> 3:18:22.020]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to
[3:18:22.020 --> 3:18:25.700]  be praying, my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know
[3:18:25.700 --> 3:18:30.660]  they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you on
[3:18:30.660 --> 3:18:34.420]  air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80. But
[3:18:34.420 --> 3:18:39.780]  if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles. And there
[3:18:39.780 --> 3:18:43.940]  are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. We're going to keep
[3:18:43.940 --> 3:18:48.580]  fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, no, for a fact,
[3:18:48.580 --> 3:18:52.660]  that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you, sir, for calling.

[3:19:56.420 --> 3:19:59.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:59.060 --> 3:20:16.580]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance.
[3:20:16.580 --> 3:20:21.860]  It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:24.020 --> 3:20:28.500]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams, the health ranger here,
[3:20:28.500 --> 3:20:33.780]  filling out the rest of the show today. As usual, I've got a lot of hard hitting unique stories for
[3:20:33.780 --> 3:20:41.060]  you. But first, I just want to comment on this insane attack on America on America's history,
[3:20:41.060 --> 3:20:46.580]  the Apollo landings. Now they're said to be racist by the Washington post. I mean,
[3:20:46.580 --> 3:20:53.780]  when the moon landing is racist, you know, you know, they've gone way too far with all the labeling
[3:20:53.780 --> 3:21:01.220]  and all the attacks. And these disgusting, filthy, wretched individuals in Congress,
[3:21:01.220 --> 3:21:07.700]  like Ilhan Omar, Ocasio-Cortez and others who literally hate this country. And in the case
[3:21:07.700 --> 3:21:13.540]  of Ilhan Omar, it looks like she committed massive marriage fraud and immigration fraud
[3:21:13.540 --> 3:21:17.700]  to get into this country. That's according to a new video I saw it this morning up on the
[3:21:17.700 --> 3:21:23.700]  Gateway Pundit. I think it's alpha news has that video. You guys got to get it on infowars.com.
[3:21:23.700 --> 3:21:28.580]  It looks like a really powerful expose of Ilhan Omar's massive fraud, by the way.
[3:21:29.220 --> 3:21:36.420]  But these people hate this country, and then they claim to love it. All they can do is talk about
[3:21:36.420 --> 3:21:43.060]  racism and genocide and concentration camps and children drinking out of toilets at the border.
[3:21:43.060 --> 3:21:48.900]  It's complete nonsense. And in the case of Ilhan Omar, you go back to her home country and, you
[3:21:48.900 --> 3:21:55.300]  know, the establishment there, it's a disaster. It's a collapsed third world, you know, authoritarian,
[3:21:55.300 --> 3:22:02.580]  gang-ridden infestation of violence and rape and murder of gay people. And every human rights
[3:22:02.580 --> 3:22:09.940]  violation you can imagine, she wants to recreate that for America. She wants to turn America into
[3:22:09.940 --> 3:22:16.100]  another kind of Somalia. You know, she wants to turn America into a collapsed nation that would
[3:22:16.100 --> 3:22:23.860]  make her feel more at home. She would feel very familiar in a country where there's massive rampant
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:28.660]  violence and abuse and raping of women and killing of gays and corrupt government and
[3:22:28.660 --> 3:22:33.380]  destitution and bribery and everything. That's familiar to her. And that's what she's trying
[3:22:33.380 --> 3:22:38.820]  to recreate in America. And I think I speak for most Americans, at least in alignment with most
[3:22:38.820 --> 3:22:46.500]  Americans, when I say, get out. Get out of America. You are not an American, Ilhan Omar. You don't
[3:22:46.500 --> 3:22:53.300]  represent America. You don't love America. And you are not even legally an American. You committed
[3:22:53.300 --> 3:22:59.300]  immigration fraud. You need to get out of this country. And all of us who are real Americans,
[3:22:59.300 --> 3:23:05.460]  like those of you watching this show, all of us, we need to assert the proper protection and
[3:23:05.460 --> 3:23:11.780]  defense of our country while welcoming legal immigrants, by the way, we welcome legal immigrants
[3:23:11.780 --> 3:23:17.700]  who want to support our Constitution and want to be real Americans and want to learn and practice
[3:23:17.700 --> 3:23:22.820]  the principles of liberty, you know, the principles of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, all these
[3:23:22.820 --> 3:23:28.500]  things. If you are willing to abide by the law and be an entrepreneur or be a hard worker and
[3:23:28.500 --> 3:23:35.060]  you're not just coming in to collect free stuff, then we welcome you legally, not illegally,
[3:23:35.060 --> 3:23:39.540]  not through marriage fraud like she committed, not through immigration fraud, not by crossing the
[3:23:39.540 --> 3:23:45.860]  border illegally. You got to come into this country legally. And then guess what? You're welcome.
[3:23:47.140 --> 3:23:52.820]  The other thing that these radical leftists are doing with these attacks on all men now,
[3:23:52.820 --> 3:23:58.100]  all men are considered bad by the radical left. All white men in particular are considered doubly
[3:23:58.100 --> 3:24:04.660]  bad. I mean, again, they're attacking the Apollo landings. They're attacking the history of science.
[3:24:04.660 --> 3:24:10.500]  And we've seen this in academia as well. They're trying to destroy the entire history of science
[3:24:10.500 --> 3:24:16.740]  or or archaeology or chemistry or physics or, you know, the space program, whatever,
[3:24:16.740 --> 3:24:22.580]  because there were white men involved. It's funny, though, they don't, the media doesn't attack the
[3:24:22.580 --> 3:24:27.860]  vaccine industry, even though vaccines are pushed by mostly white men. Somehow those white men are
[3:24:27.860 --> 3:24:34.020]  heroes for pushing vaccines, but the white men who flew to the moon, suddenly they're bad,
[3:24:34.020 --> 3:24:40.660]  really? What kind of bizarre standard is that? Well, it's no standard. It's complete hypocrisy.
[3:24:40.660 --> 3:24:46.260]  The left is deranged. Nothing they say makes any sense. But what they do want to do is destroy
[3:24:46.260 --> 3:24:52.340]  our history. They are tearing down our monuments. They want to take down history. They want to
[3:24:52.340 --> 3:24:58.580]  destroy your memory of who you are and the culture that you represent. And this, my friends,
[3:24:59.140 --> 3:25:03.140]  this is what the communists do. This is that they do it every time. It's like the cultural
[3:25:03.140 --> 3:25:10.020]  revolution under Maoist China. This is a Stalinist type of approach. You destroy the history,
[3:25:10.020 --> 3:25:16.900]  take down the monuments, rewrite the history books, and send the champions of your society into the
[3:25:16.900 --> 3:25:23.140]  gulags and then replace everything with communism. This is what the left is trying to do. It is a
[3:25:23.140 --> 3:25:29.780]  radical, lawless, anti-human, anti-humanitarian approach. And this is what they're trying to push.
[3:25:29.780 --> 3:25:36.660]  The left-wing media is complicit. They are terrorist organizations. I'm the one who coined the term
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:42.260]  journal terrorist. It was several years ago. And I said CNN. They're journal terrorists.
[3:25:42.260 --> 3:25:48.020]  Now we see yet more confirmation that that's exactly what's happened. These left-wing
[3:25:48.020 --> 3:25:53.380]  journal terrorist organizations like New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC,
[3:25:53.380 --> 3:26:00.020]  they all in one way or another endorse the radical left-wing antifa terrorism. They endorse it.
[3:26:00.020 --> 3:26:06.660]  And then they refuse to retract their endorsements. They refuse to apologize just like Ilhan Omar,
[3:26:06.660 --> 3:26:13.860]  just like AOC, just like the others, part of the squad. They refuse to condemn, at least
[3:26:13.860 --> 3:26:18.340]  at first they refuse. I think some of them later backtrack and said, yeah, they condemn it. But
[3:26:18.340 --> 3:26:25.060]  at first, when first challenged, they refused to condemn acts of terrorism, the firebombing
[3:26:25.060 --> 3:26:31.300]  of an ICE detention center by a radical left-wing antifa terrorist who was parroting the words of
[3:26:31.300 --> 3:26:36.900]  Ocasio-Cortez, by the way. Ocasio-Cortez is the inspiration for left-wing terrorists.
[3:26:36.900 --> 3:26:43.940]  They cite her words as they're throwing incendiary devices and trying to blow up cars and government
[3:26:43.940 --> 3:26:50.980]  buildings and shoot up ICE detention guards and so on, border patrol people and so on.
[3:26:51.860 --> 3:26:57.140]  This is the radical left. This is their plan. And they have only just begun.
[3:26:58.100 --> 3:27:02.900]  And I want to give you an analysis here. I'll give you more detail on the other side of this
[3:27:02.900 --> 3:27:08.420]  coming break. I want to bring you back to an interview between Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers
[3:27:08.420 --> 3:27:13.540]  and Alex Jones just a couple of days ago. I forgot which day exactly. But Stuart Rhodes
[3:27:13.540 --> 3:27:20.260]  said something in that interview that was mind blowing about what's coming. He said that no
[3:27:20.260 --> 3:27:27.380]  matter what the outcome of the 2020 election, the outcome will not be accepted by half the country.
[3:27:27.380 --> 3:27:33.060]  In other words, if Trump wins, the left will go insane. They will not accept Trump
[3:27:33.060 --> 3:27:40.420]  achieving victory yet again. If the left wins the election, it can only be by massive coordinated
[3:27:40.420 --> 3:27:46.260]  fraud, ballot harvesting, illegals voting in places like California and New York.
[3:27:46.260 --> 3:27:52.260]  And I believe Stuart is correct when he says that conservative America will not accept
[3:27:52.260 --> 3:27:58.580]  another stolen election. We already endured one stolen election, which was the 2018 midterms.
[3:27:58.580 --> 3:28:03.940]  We will not endure another stolen election. So no matter who wins or loses in 2020,
[3:28:03.940 --> 3:28:12.100]  America erupts into a civil war. Very likely that's the outcome. Now, when we come back after
[3:28:12.100 --> 3:28:17.860]  this coming break, I'm going to talk about what that civil war might look like and how to prepare
[3:28:17.860 --> 3:28:23.300]  yourself and things that you need to start doing right now to get ready for that civil war. Because
[3:28:23.300 --> 3:28:30.180]  it will be devastating. The power grid will likely be taken down in one way or another. And foreign
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:36.740]  powers are likely to get involved with probably communist China occupying the west coast of
[3:28:36.740 --> 3:28:43.300]  California to the cheers of the radical commie leftists who now run California. There will be
[3:28:43.300 --> 3:28:48.580]  a major war in California if this unfolds as we see. Stay with us here. We'll be right back
[3:28:48.580 --> 3:28:57.620]  after this break. Alex Jones show back. When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck,
[3:28:57.620 --> 3:29:04.020]  back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another

[3:30:53.700 --> 3:30:59.220]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[3:30:59.220 --> 3:31:03.300]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[3:31:03.300 --> 3:31:08.500]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods.
[3:31:08.500 --> 3:31:12.260]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third
[3:31:12.260 --> 3:31:16.820]  dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot
[3:31:16.820 --> 3:31:21.700]  of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[3:31:21.700 --> 3:31:28.020]  from the forerslife.com I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that
[3:31:28.020 --> 3:31:33.300]  was incredibly high quality megalocobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula,
[3:31:33.300 --> 3:31:39.620]  ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality b12 over the counter that you're
[3:31:39.620 --> 3:31:45.060]  going to find anywhere. It is amazing experience pure megalocobalamin b12 for yourself and fund
[3:31:45.060 --> 3:31:51.780]  the second american evolution against the tyrants at info wars store.com info warslife.com or triple
[3:31:51.780 --> 3:31:58.580]  eight 253 3139. I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I decided that
[3:31:58.580 --> 3:32:02.580]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before
[3:32:02.580 --> 3:32:06.500]  all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it, I would talk about how great the
[3:32:06.500 --> 3:32:10.260]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to
[3:32:10.260 --> 3:32:13.860]  explain why they were so good and instead the last few years I'm like hey we need to really
[3:32:13.860 --> 3:32:17.220]  support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because
[3:32:17.220 --> 3:32:20.980]  they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere
[3:32:20.980 --> 3:32:27.780]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[3:32:27.780 --> 3:32:32.420]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[3:32:32.420 --> 3:32:36.900]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[3:32:36.900 --> 3:32:40.740]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[3:32:40.740 --> 3:32:44.660]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma
[3:32:44.660 --> 3:32:50.980]  doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five
[3:32:50.980 --> 3:33:03.620]  three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:03.620 --> 3:33:14.900]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:33:17.380 --> 3:33:22.820]  no google is actually now it has become a pharmaceutical company in essence and amazon
[3:33:22.820 --> 3:33:26.340]  is heading that way as well i'm going to get to the civil war analysis here in just a second but
[3:33:26.900 --> 3:33:31.140]  something i heard there during the break just reminded me to say that one of the reasons info
[3:33:31.140 --> 3:33:36.420]  wars is under such severe attack by the tech giants is because the tech giants are becoming
[3:33:36.420 --> 3:33:44.660]  part of the pharma cartel the pharmaceutical cartel controls the media 70 of media advertising
[3:33:44.660 --> 3:33:51.540]  revenues come from drug companies and that was legalized by the fda under bill clinton i believe
[3:33:51.540 --> 3:34:00.740]  in 1997 and so the pharma cartels control the media they control all information pharma cartels
[3:34:00.740 --> 3:34:09.060]  control wikipedia and they control now google they control facebook twitter everything and so
[3:34:09.700 --> 3:34:16.020]  the pharma cartels think about what is their number one goal is to turn you into a lifetime repeat
[3:34:16.020 --> 3:34:22.020]  customer who's suffering from ongoing diseases mental health conditions and physical health
[3:34:22.020 --> 3:34:27.380]  conditions cancer and everything else diabetes they do not want you to be well because if you are
[3:34:27.380 --> 3:34:33.940]  healthy you don't need their products and they want to shut down the natural supplements industry
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:39.700]  because it's natural supplements that help you stay healthy so you don't get sick all the time
[3:34:39.700 --> 3:34:43.860]  and that's why that's one of the reasons why they're attacking info wars so much and why
[3:34:43.860 --> 3:34:49.220]  they're attacking me as well because one of the things that we both have in common is a nutritional
[3:34:49.220 --> 3:34:56.580]  supplements and advocacy of nutrition and if you could see the mountain of scientific evidence
[3:34:56.580 --> 3:35:02.260]  that i go through every day if you could see how much scientific evidence there is for turmeric
[3:35:02.260 --> 3:35:08.740]  or iodine or omega three oils from fish oils or things like that you'd be blown away you would
[3:35:08.740 --> 3:35:15.060]  have immediately know that we have the answer for lifelong health and longevity for every american
[3:35:15.060 --> 3:35:20.980]  the answer already exists the answer is found in supplements and superfoods and nutrition
[3:35:20.980 --> 3:35:27.940]  and yet the entire tech tyranny cartel and the drug cartels and everybody the media and so on
[3:35:27.940 --> 3:35:34.500]  academia scientific research they're all aligned with a message to try to lie to you and say that
[3:35:34.500 --> 3:35:41.380]  nutrition doesn't work and that you were born with a deficiency in pharmaceuticals and vaccines of
[3:35:41.380 --> 3:35:47.300]  course right so think about it they say that you're born your brain is deficient when you're born
[3:35:47.300 --> 3:35:51.620]  that your brain won't be complete until you have these pharmaceutical chemicals in your brain
[3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:57.780]  that's their message and it's absurd it's just as absurd as stating that men can become women
[3:35:57.780 --> 3:36:04.580]  was just as absurd as saying that the apollo landings were racist because there were men
[3:36:04.580 --> 3:36:10.020]  who landed on the moon instead of women and and no doubt by the way just as another side note if
[3:36:10.020 --> 3:36:15.300]  if disney or holly hollywood ever remakes a documentary about the apollo landings no doubt
[3:36:15.300 --> 3:36:22.580]  they will replace those men with transgender women it will be trannies on the moon you know part one
[3:36:22.580 --> 3:36:27.220]  two and three that will be the future that you will see because they have to erase history
[3:36:27.220 --> 3:36:34.580]  and replace every white man with trannies on the moon it'll be seriously i mean it sounds like a
[3:36:34.580 --> 3:36:39.620]  joke but this is what they're doing across media but getting back to pharma and then i'll get back
[3:36:39.620 --> 3:36:44.900]  to the civil war so i'm taking some subroutines here but pharma you need to know part of the
[3:36:44.900 --> 3:36:52.340]  attacks on alex jones are because his products literally keep people healthy no joke i'm a
[3:36:52.340 --> 3:36:58.580]  food scientist i run a food lab i i know a lot about nutrition i take the same ingredients
[3:36:58.580 --> 3:37:04.100]  every day the same types of supplements that info war store sells and in some cases that actual
[3:37:04.100 --> 3:37:08.260]  info war supplements even though i have my own line of other types of things as well but the
[3:37:08.260 --> 3:37:13.540]  point is don't be suckered into the pharma cartel and if you really want to be healthy go to info
[3:37:13.540 --> 3:37:19.380]  wars store dot com their products actually do work and they make a huge difference in your life
[3:37:19.380 --> 3:37:24.740]  and your quality of life now getting back to the civil war analysis here's some good news
[3:37:24.740 --> 3:37:30.020]  i mentioned on the info wars uh on info wars interview i think last week there was a really
[3:37:30.020 --> 3:37:36.660]  great analysis video out there called civil war two who will win by a guy named john mark who i
[3:37:36.660 --> 3:37:40.580]  didn't i didn't know who that was but i checked out his channel on youtube and i invited him
[3:37:40.580 --> 3:37:45.460]  to come over to bright yon dot com which has just gone through a major upgrade by the way bright
[3:37:45.460 --> 3:37:52.660]  yon 2.0 is now active all the free roll ads are eliminated from the videos and his video is there
[3:37:52.660 --> 3:37:58.100]  now because it was probably going to be deleted by youtube i just want to encourage you now info
[3:37:58.100 --> 3:38:03.540]  wars uploads everything right now to bright yon but if you have a video out there whether it's a
[3:38:03.540 --> 3:38:11.700]  gun rights video a self-defense video video uh criticizing transgenderism or the lgbt uh
[3:38:11.700 --> 3:38:18.340]  mafia or whatever if you think that video is going to be banned get it over to a bit chute get it
[3:38:18.340 --> 3:38:23.540]  over to bright yon dot com get it to i think d tube is another one that's out there get your videos
[3:38:23.540 --> 3:38:30.820]  onto these alternative platforms so they can be safe without censorship that's the only way that
[3:38:30.820 --> 3:38:35.700]  you're going to be assured that your videos will continue to have reach and we're doing everything
[3:38:35.700 --> 3:38:41.540]  in our power to build a better system for you uh it's still not profitable it you know it takes
[3:38:41.540 --> 3:38:46.100]  a lot of money to build and run a system like that but we're doing it as a public service frankly
[3:38:46.100 --> 3:38:51.620]  to to help support your free speech now in that video that's now on bright yon the civil war two
[3:38:51.620 --> 3:38:58.100]  analysis uh john mark i think his name talks about the coming civil war what i think you
[3:38:58.100 --> 3:39:05.700]  need to understand is that it will be geographically local where you know civil war one in american
[3:39:05.700 --> 3:39:12.500]  history was the north versus the south but what's coming in civil war two is going to be every every
[3:39:12.500 --> 3:39:19.380]  state or essentially every state will be the rural areas versus the state capital or the dominant
[3:39:19.380 --> 3:39:26.820]  cities in that state so for example in colorado the civil war it wouldn't be north colorado versus
[3:39:26.820 --> 3:39:33.460]  south colorado it would be rural colorado versus denver you know versus the the left wing tyrants
[3:39:33.460 --> 3:39:40.020]  in denver in california it's going to be rural california versus the left wing communist leaders
[3:39:40.020 --> 3:39:46.100]  in sacramento and san francisco and los angeles and so on in oregon same type of thing it's going
[3:39:46.100 --> 3:39:53.220]  to be rural oregon versus the insane left wing anti american lunatics in portland and in washington
[3:39:53.220 --> 3:40:00.260]  state same deal rural washington versus seattle which is collapsing into third world status even
[3:40:00.260 --> 3:40:05.540]  as we speak now in some states like you know moving slightly to the east from that go to
[3:40:05.540 --> 3:40:11.220]  idaho and wyoming and montana probably not going to have much of a civil war there maybe a very
[3:40:11.220 --> 3:40:18.580]  short-lived one especially in idaho because idaho is a patriotic state almost everybody in idaho
[3:40:18.580 --> 3:40:23.380]  loves america and they're going to defend america and if there are any traitors or enemies of america
[3:40:23.380 --> 3:40:32.580]  in idaho they will be well we'll just say quickly nullified they will be out of power very quickly
[3:40:32.580 --> 3:40:38.100]  same thing's true in wyoming probably much the same is true in places like nevada and utah
[3:40:38.660 --> 3:40:43.860]  arizona might be some some fighting in certain areas surrounding phoenix but again what john
[3:40:43.860 --> 3:40:50.740]  mark points out in his video is that every city depends on electricity and inputs inputs like
[3:40:50.740 --> 3:40:56.740]  food and water i already mentioned electricity but also fuel so those inputs have to come into the
[3:40:56.740 --> 3:41:04.260]  city and it's a simple matter he explains for in a civil war type of scenario it's a simple matter
[3:41:04.260 --> 3:41:10.180]  to disconnect those cities from those inputs and honestly how long does los angeles last
[3:41:10.180 --> 3:41:17.060]  if there is no electricity and we're starting to see power grid failures recently in new york city
[3:41:17.060 --> 3:41:21.460]  and in southern california just the other day power grid failures are increasing even in the
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:27.380]  good times not to mention a civil war or a foreign power invading our country or the chinese
[3:41:27.380 --> 3:41:33.060]  landing communist troops on the west coast and so on believe me if the communist chinese take
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:39.140]  over los angeles and are working with governor newson who is a communist in my view uh it's
[3:41:39.140 --> 3:41:45.860]  going to be a very very quick reaction by patriots in california to probably cut off the
[3:41:45.860 --> 3:41:50.740]  los angeles power grid and stop all food deliveries and fuel deliveries to los angeles
[3:41:50.740 --> 3:41:55.940]  because that will be necessary to defend our country against a foreign invader who is working
[3:41:55.940 --> 3:42:02.820]  with traders i.e. newson and others who are trying to betray this country so what what stewart roads
[3:42:02.820 --> 3:42:08.340]  mentioned that i think is worth repeating is that all the military veterans in america almost all
[3:42:08.340 --> 3:42:14.020]  of them are pro america and they don't need orders from headquarters to take action they already know
[3:42:14.020 --> 3:42:18.580]  what to do in fact they've been trained by the military to do the kinds of things that need to
[3:42:18.580 --> 3:42:24.820]  be done to defend their country against seditious traders acts of treason and acts of domestic
[3:42:24.820 --> 3:42:32.500]  terrorism carried out by radical leftists and these these haters of america trump doesn't even need
[3:42:32.500 --> 3:42:37.700]  to say anything people are going to take action on their own to defend this country against those
[3:42:37.700 --> 3:42:42.500]  who are trying to destroy it that's what's coming so you have a very short period of time 18 months
[3:42:42.500 --> 3:42:48.420]  or so or less to get out of the cities before that happens stay tuned more straight ahead here on the
[3:42:48.420 --> 3:42:56.980]  alex jones show it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:43:01.940]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[3:43:01.940 --> 3:43:06.740]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[3:43:06.740 --> 3:43:10.740]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all
[3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:16.340]  that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of
[3:43:16.340 --> 3:43:20.500]  press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[3:43:20.500 --> 3:43:25.220]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[3:43:25.220 --> 3:43:28.820]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[3:43:28.820 --> 3:43:32.980]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[3:43:32.980 --> 3:43:38.260]  control and manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and
[3:43:38.260 --> 3:43:43.380]  the info wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the
[3:43:43.380 --> 3:43:47.620]  modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[3:43:47.620 --> 3:43:53.940]  onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth there's going to be a
[3:43:53.940 --> 3:44:00.740]  social media summit here in dc tomorrow of course info wars ground zero for the censorship alex
[3:44:00.740 --> 3:44:05.380]  jones patient zero for the censorship doesn't even get an invite but that's fine we'll play the dark
[3:44:05.380 --> 3:44:09.460]  night we hope that there's other people there that will bring us up bring alex jones up bring some
[3:44:09.460 --> 3:44:14.740]  of the other band names like gavin mcginnis and mylolyn atlas and laura lumar up as well and they
[3:44:14.740 --> 3:44:20.580]  won't be bullied by some of the conservatives that like to censor those voices as well at the summit
[3:44:20.580 --> 3:44:25.780]  but we'll see i have a feeling this is just going to be throwing a dog a bone padding him on the head
[3:44:25.780 --> 3:44:31.140]  and telling him to move on with his day but hopefully maybe disperse some action from congress from
[3:44:31.140 --> 3:44:35.940]  the president from the white house to do something about the big tech censorship before the 2020
[3:44:35.940 --> 3:44:40.820]  elections when it's going to be so key it was info wars presence on social media that helped get
[3:44:40.820 --> 3:44:46.340]  trump into the white house that's why we are targeted so let's see what happens at the social

[3:47:12.980 --> 3:47:20.820]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with mike adams
[3:47:20.820 --> 3:47:27.380]  talk about the climate change hoax today in this final segment a little bit but first
[3:47:28.340 --> 3:47:32.900]  something about nature you can learn a lot from observing mother nature and i live on a ranch
[3:47:32.900 --> 3:47:38.180]  in central texas and i spend a lot of time with animals and just observing all the different life
[3:47:38.180 --> 3:47:44.740]  forms around and comparing that to what human society has become and one of the reasons why
[3:47:44.740 --> 3:47:51.460]  i think democrats and leftists and abortion pushers are so demonic is because they're dissociated
[3:47:51.460 --> 3:47:57.060]  from nature think about these radical leftists like ilhan omar and they say oh children are
[3:47:57.060 --> 3:48:01.220]  drinking out of toilets at the border or they say oh the children are being separated from their
[3:48:01.220 --> 3:48:07.620]  families these are the same people that advocate the murder of children so it's a joke it these
[3:48:07.620 --> 3:48:12.100]  people are pathetic liars and fakers when they talk about caring for children because
[3:48:12.100 --> 3:48:17.300]  they kill their own children you know and they celebrate it but you don't see that in nature
[3:48:18.180 --> 3:48:24.420]  i've i've observed all kinds of animals out in the wild i mean from owls and raccoons salamanders
[3:48:24.420 --> 3:48:31.380]  lizards frogs toads uh i've got donkeys goats dogs every everything that you can imagine
[3:48:31.380 --> 3:48:36.180]  out in nature all the different birds all the different insects of praying mantis insects
[3:48:36.180 --> 3:48:42.340]  guess what i've never seen i've never seen not even a cockroach killing its own children
[3:48:42.980 --> 3:48:48.180]  which means that these democrats that are advocating abortion are lower than cockroaches
[3:48:48.740 --> 3:48:55.140]  because even field mice and and rats i mean swamp rats don't even kill their own babies they
[3:48:55.140 --> 3:49:01.540]  try to keep their babies alive again insects even cockroaches they try to nourish their children
[3:49:01.540 --> 3:49:07.620]  and allow them to survive because it's the survival instinct and guess what else all of these species
[3:49:07.620 --> 3:49:14.340]  they reproduce by something called sexual reproduction which requires a biological male
[3:49:14.340 --> 3:49:20.820]  and a biological female and those are different and yet the radical left today they want to claim
[3:49:20.820 --> 3:49:25.220]  that they're compassionate they're murdering their own babies and claiming there's no such thing as a
[3:49:25.220 --> 3:49:30.980]  male or a female or that you can transition at any time by wishing it so that men can get pregnant
[3:49:30.980 --> 3:49:37.780]  and have babies you know these these are the those are the lunatic rantings of a cult of a
[3:49:37.780 --> 3:49:43.860]  suicide cult really that that has no sustainability for the future of life on earth that's what leftists
[3:49:43.860 --> 3:49:49.700]  are and if we could just speed up the the Darwin award a little bit speed up that evolutionary
[3:49:49.700 --> 3:49:56.020]  clock so to speak all these radical leftists who believe in transgenderism they are extinct
[3:49:56.020 --> 3:50:01.940]  because they cannot reproduce they are cutting off their reproductive organs they are chemically
[3:50:01.940 --> 3:50:08.260]  castrating their children and murdering their children they cannot reproduce they have no future
[3:50:08.260 --> 3:50:14.340]  because of what they believe which is insane and a complete violation of nature and again if you go
[3:50:14.340 --> 3:50:22.180]  around nature what you see in nature is male and female parents having offspring and those parents
[3:50:22.180 --> 3:50:27.620]  caring for that offspring and trying to keep them alive as best they can you know whether it's a
[3:50:28.500 --> 3:50:35.700]  baby deer with you know just just a doe out there they're trying to keep that baby deer alive you
[3:50:35.700 --> 3:50:40.820]  know whether it's a baby donkey and I've I've carried a baby donkey right after it was born
[3:50:40.820 --> 3:50:46.180]  you know still wet and gooey and everything carrying it to try to get it to nurse and everything and
[3:50:46.180 --> 3:50:52.820]  there's a survival instinct there and we we see that when we observe nature but people who live in
[3:50:52.820 --> 3:50:59.460]  cities who become radical leftists they've lost the survival instinct of humankind and it's not
[3:50:59.460 --> 3:51:05.540]  just that they have no will to survive it's that they want to murder everybody else as they destroy
[3:51:05.540 --> 3:51:11.700]  themselves they are a suicide cult this is why they want to kill white people they want to kill
[3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:18.420]  Trump supporters they want to murder Americans they want to murder Christians they they literally
[3:51:18.420 --> 3:51:24.660]  have nothing but blood and violence and murder on their minds at all hours of the day they are
[3:51:24.660 --> 3:51:29.940]  seething with lunatic hatred and they and then they demonstrate it by murdering their own children
[3:51:29.940 --> 3:51:36.900]  as well that's what we are facing so when when the day comes to defend yourself or defend your
[3:51:36.900 --> 3:51:43.300]  family or defend your country against these deranged murderous violent lunatics do not
[3:51:43.300 --> 3:51:50.580]  hesitate my friends do not hesitate for one moment because these radical left-wing murderers they
[3:51:50.580 --> 3:51:58.260]  deserve exactly what they are bringing down upon themselves do not hesitate they want death they
[3:51:58.260 --> 3:52:04.020]  want to kill everything every living thing on this planet this is the climate change hoax it's
[3:52:04.020 --> 3:52:10.100]  about mass death they want to kill the food webs they want to kill the plants because they want to
[3:52:10.100 --> 3:52:16.180]  dim sunlight reduce photosynthesis and by doing so by collapsing the food webs they will kill
[3:52:16.180 --> 3:52:22.260]  humanity as well this is their goal this is their desire they are a death cult never forget that
[3:52:22.260 --> 3:52:26.900]  that's what we're up against you think this is a battle about politics you think this is a battle
[3:52:26.900 --> 3:52:33.860]  just for the future of america no it's a battle for the future of life on earth this is a cosmic
[3:52:33.860 --> 3:52:41.540]  battle for the future of our entire species not just our way of life as americans but our very
[3:52:41.540 --> 3:52:47.220]  existence on this planet that is what the radical left opposes that's what the globalists oppose
[3:52:47.220 --> 3:52:53.700]  they openly talk about depopulation they talk about using mosquitoes to have stealth vaccines of
[3:52:53.700 --> 3:53:00.260]  people they they run experiments in africa with infertility chemicals in the vaccines they've
[3:53:00.260 --> 3:53:07.060]  weaponized vaccines into death systems death vectors they've weaponized the food supply with
[3:53:07.700 --> 3:53:14.340]  chemical weed killer and other pesticides that that that caused death that caused disease that
[3:53:14.340 --> 3:53:20.900]  caused cancer and they've weaponized everything the entire food supply chain with plastics plastics
[3:53:20.900 --> 3:53:29.300]  that contain hormone disruptors hormone disruptors that influence the perception of hormone balance
[3:53:29.300 --> 3:53:37.620]  in human biological systems atrazine is known as a chemical castrator atrazine actually it really
[3:53:37.620 --> 3:53:45.780]  does turn amphibians from one gender to another famously alex jones said i think they turn the
[3:53:45.780 --> 3:53:52.340]  freaking frogs gay that's not inaccurate that's actually a very accurate description of what
[3:53:52.340 --> 3:53:57.380]  atrazine does it's a chemical castrator and it's the second most commonly used herbicide
[3:53:57.380 --> 3:54:03.460]  across america it's in all the water it's in most of the foods i know i see it because we're doing
[3:54:03.460 --> 3:54:09.860]  the testing in our lab we see atrazine we see glyphosate we see ampa we see heavy metals all
[3:54:09.860 --> 3:54:15.860]  these things that affect human hormones cause infertility cause mental instability and insanity
[3:54:16.500 --> 3:54:20.820]  and even from that perspective some of these radical leftists it's not even their own fault
[3:54:20.820 --> 3:54:25.860]  how deranged they've become because they're poisoned they're poisoned with chemical exposure
[3:54:25.860 --> 3:54:32.180]  the poison with heavy metals and they are out of control they have been essentially assaulted
[3:54:32.180 --> 3:54:38.500]  carpet bombed with chemicals that is the absolute truth about what's happening in our world now
[3:54:38.500 --> 3:54:44.580]  getting to the climate change hoax in particular a new study was published this i don't know what
[3:54:44.580 --> 3:54:51.140]  was it monday or a few days ago that really found the root cause of variations in earth's
[3:54:51.140 --> 3:54:57.300]  temperature and it's not from carbon dioxide it is in fact from the wavering strength or
[3:54:57.300 --> 3:55:02.740]  weakness of earth's magnetosphere that's the magnetic what do you call it like a magnetic
[3:55:02.740 --> 3:55:08.980]  bubble around earth that deflects many different types of cosmic rays because they can't get
[3:55:08.980 --> 3:55:15.300]  through the magnetic shield so to speak of our planet well that magnetosphere is always in flux
[3:55:15.300 --> 3:55:20.500]  sometimes it's weaker sometimes it's stronger sometimes there have been pole shifts in the
[3:55:20.500 --> 3:55:26.020]  history of our planet where north and south flipped completely in fact they flipped hundreds of times
[3:55:26.020 --> 3:55:30.580]  in earth's past how did that happen well the magnetosphere got really weak and it started
[3:55:30.580 --> 3:55:34.180]  to have flux in it and then it flipped the other direction and then it got stronger
[3:55:34.180 --> 3:55:40.100]  these cycles of weakness and strength in the magnetosphere they either allow or block cosmic
[3:55:40.100 --> 3:55:47.220]  rays to penetrate earth's atmosphere resulting in either the formation of more clouds or the
[3:55:47.220 --> 3:55:54.820]  elimination of clouds at low low low altitude in the atmosphere these clouds then either shield
[3:55:54.820 --> 3:55:59.940]  the earth's surface from the sun because they have shade just like if you're standing in the
[3:55:59.940 --> 3:56:05.620]  shade in the summer you don't have the sun making you hot right same thing is true for earth's surface
[3:56:05.620 --> 3:56:11.860]  more clouds means lower earth temperatures fewer clouds means higher earth temperatures or global
[3:56:11.860 --> 3:56:18.660]  warming so it's actually the magnetosphere that determines global warming and global cooling
[3:56:18.660 --> 3:56:24.500]  more than any other single factor yeah of course the sun and solar cycles are very much involved
[3:56:24.500 --> 3:56:29.780]  and carbon dioxide has a very tiny effect but an order of magnitude less than what the current
[3:56:29.780 --> 3:56:35.300]  scientific community believes and human activity as was said in the study is only can only account
[3:56:35.300 --> 3:56:42.740]  for about 0.01 degrees celsius of any kind of rise in global temperature and besides carbon
[3:56:42.740 --> 3:56:47.860]  dioxide is fertilizer and food for plants co2 is good for plants you want to make the earth green
[3:56:47.860 --> 3:56:52.980]  emit more co2 the plants will love you for it the food crops will grow more abundantly the
[3:56:52.980 --> 3:56:58.580]  rainforest will recover the grasslands will take over from what used to be desert carbon dioxide
[3:56:58.580 --> 3:57:03.700]  is good for our planet and that's why the left wants to eliminate it because they are all about
[3:57:03.700 --> 3:57:09.060]  death they're all about collapse they want to destroy all life on our planet as we know it today
[3:57:10.020 --> 3:57:14.500]  so that's the takeaway from this today remember because we're just about out of time here for
[3:57:14.500 --> 3:57:20.260]  today remember that they don't want to just kill you for your politics they want to kill you because
[3:57:20.260 --> 3:57:26.100]  you're living because you have a soul because you have consciousness they want to destroy
[3:57:26.100 --> 3:57:32.020]  everything that you represent at a cosmic level and that's why the radical left must be defeated

[3:58:47.540 --> 3:58:51.700]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[3:58:51.700 --> 3:58:56.420]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[3:58:56.420 --> 3:59:01.460]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[3:59:01.460 --> 3:59:06.180]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[3:59:06.180 --> 3:59:09.700]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[3:59:09.700 --> 3:59:13.700]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the
[3:59:13.700 --> 3:59:18.020]  last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
