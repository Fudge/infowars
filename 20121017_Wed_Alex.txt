[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:35.040]  Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday the 17th day of October 2012 and we're going
[00:35.040 --> 00:42.720]  to be live here for the next three hours coming up later in the hour Joseph
[00:42.720 --> 00:46.640]  Curl who is one of the main correspondence to the White House
[00:46.640 --> 00:50.600]  coverage for the Washington Times he was at the debate last night he's going to
[00:50.600 --> 00:55.320]  be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes to give us his take on what
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.000]  happened look I know it's a dog and pony show and both guys are bought and paid
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.480]  for pretty much by the same interest but Crowley absolutely interrupted Obama
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.440]  interrupted it was like watching a fight where one boxer is allowed to have a
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.960]  horseshoe in their gloves basically it was like watching a dirty fight Romney
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.720]  still won but it was disgusting watching him sit there and make excuses about his
[01:20.720 --> 01:25.160]  assault weapons ban and stuff but it was scary watching Obama get all excited
[01:25.160 --> 01:30.480]  about banning semi-autos that's what he called for ban on assault rifles that's
[01:30.480 --> 01:35.000]  all semi-autos is what that list and saying also they want to just take your
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.960]  guns extra judicially just saying you're mentally ill because that's how they're
[01:38.960 --> 01:42.760]  really going to go after it is just outside of law as they've done with the
[01:42.760 --> 01:48.440]  EPA shutting down power plants or land grabbing or saying NATO runs our
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.240]  military they just do it extra legislatively extra judicially outside
[01:53.240 --> 01:57.560]  of law it's called dictatorial and when somebody does that a lot you call them a
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.760]  dictator yeah that's where that term comes from so I mean it's it's really
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.360]  Creepville and I I'm not someone easily manipulated in fact I was sitting there
[02:09.360 --> 02:16.080]  watching the debate last night and I don't believe in lesser of two evils but
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.960]  I just have this feeling which is based in all the different facts that it's
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.200]  immoral to just sit here and say oh they're all bad I'm not going to support
[02:26.200 --> 02:29.080]  either one of them because what Joseph Farrah has said and he's on the show
[02:29.080 --> 02:33.920]  Friday this is so bad he didn't support John McCain four years ago he you know
[02:33.920 --> 02:41.360]  he wrote the book you know neither of the above but there's this feeling that
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.160]  Obama's got things in store well the reeducation camps that is Obama's
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.440]  people that globalist management crew that that flavor of poison in fact to
[02:52.440 --> 02:55.560]  one of our great graphics people he didn't like getting credits I won't
[02:55.560 --> 03:02.680]  plug his name maybe a street name he's a well-known street artist here in Austin
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.920]  he did a big graphics the upcoming magazine but I think we're gonna get
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.520]  that show that later and it's a double-barreled derringer one says Obama
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.000]  one says Romney pointed at America's head you know it's a guy wearing red
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.840]  white and blue and you know that's true to a certain extent but it's kind of
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.120]  Obama's this howitzer cannon and then there's a smaller cannon that's Romney
[03:22.120 --> 03:26.200]  but do you just let it all get really bad and okay well it's worse is better
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.240]  let's get Obama in certainly would be good for my radio show at least in the
[03:31.240 --> 03:36.600]  short term people kind of go to sleep if Romney gets in but I'm still like man I
[03:36.600 --> 03:40.480]  don't want Obama in there and I'm being honest about that that's when I'm
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.480]  feeling personally from all the different facts and I'm against the whole
[03:45.480 --> 03:49.080]  left-right paradigm I know Romney's bad he's terrible globalist Republican
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.040]  Rhino anti-second amendment you know wrote the health care bill I mean I know
[03:53.040 --> 03:58.200]  he works for the same people it's just for the Obama it's moving so fast but
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.600]  maybe that's just because the globalists are moving fast and Romney
[04:02.600 --> 04:06.160]  would do the same thing and so it's kind of picked your poison they got a gun to
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.920]  our head saying we'll drink strict nine or drink you know arsenic and and and
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.200]  both of them you know and at the levels they're trying to have us drink them our
[04:14.200 --> 04:23.080]  poison so I'm just being honest about the way I feel you know what happened you
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.600]  know with Ron Paul I got mad at Rand Paul not not for endorsing Romney I mean
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.240]  I understand he's part of the Republican Party he knows him he promises to be
[04:31.240 --> 04:35.280]  pro-gun anti-globalist even though in the past his voting records different it
[04:35.280 --> 04:42.280]  was the Ron Paul minions you know in the campaign writing articles saying we
[04:42.280 --> 04:46.520]  shouldn't criticize the Bilderberg group anymore and you know the people that
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.880]  brought Ron Paul to where he is you know we're conspiracy cooks that's my
[04:50.880 --> 04:54.960]  issue there just to be clear all right I'm gonna continue flushing all this out
[04:54.960 --> 05:01.120]  huge news more death threats on Romney it's all coming up sick of the globalist

[08:16.520 --> 08:21.640]  thank you for joining us we are going to have post-debate coverage here in
[08:21.640 --> 08:27.000]  detail the Washington Times correspond to the White House does of curl will be
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  joining us he was at the debate last night to give us his take on what he saw
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.240]  I'll be getting into the really big news as well today Israel threatens Syrian
[08:35.240 --> 08:40.520]  intervention over chemical weapons so they're back pushing that US troops
[08:40.520 --> 08:44.120]  via NATO are massing all around the country and of course for at least four
[08:44.120 --> 08:48.280]  months have been on the ground in the nine-month conflict aiding the jihadis
[08:48.280 --> 08:52.320]  that they're bringing in the New York Times yesterday reported what we've been
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.440]  telling you for many many months that the main force is al-Qaeda and that
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.680]  they're getting arms but they report it like oh we may have to do something
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.480]  about this so that later they can then call for airstrikes on al-Qaeda after
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.040]  al-Qaeda has taken over the country it's it's unbelievable just like they're
[09:09.040 --> 09:14.200]  now getting strikes ready with drones and special forces against al-Qaeda in
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.600]  Libya the groups over a year ago I said they were putting in they confirmed they
[09:19.600 --> 09:25.280]  used in mass the main force out of Benghazi in the east into the rest of
[09:25.280 --> 09:30.200]  Libya and now they're saying they're gonna have a new invasion all over
[09:30.200 --> 09:34.400]  Africa from North Africa to Central Africa to stop al-Qaeda but the West
[09:34.400 --> 09:39.760]  put in I mean that is amazing that they think the public is that dumb they can
[09:39.760 --> 09:43.800]  get away with that and you know what a lot of the public is that ignorant not
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.840]  so much dumb but ignorant willfully ignorant they just hey there's a war
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.280]  there's some bad guys over there we're like yeah but those bad guys work for
[09:53.280 --> 09:56.520]  the globalist and they're taking our liberties in the name of fighting those
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.880]  bad guys but then they're baiting and switching and using the whole police
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.840]  state on the American people and saying returning veterans gun owners libertarians
[10:04.840 --> 10:09.320]  that we're the main terror threat I told you that years ago now it's mainstream
[10:09.320 --> 10:12.600]  news they're telling the cops yeah I know it's the veterans it's the
[10:12.600 --> 10:16.720]  libertarians it's people that don't like the new world order it's not that the
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.080]  new order doesn't exist now it's that we're bad because we don't like it so
[10:22.080 --> 10:27.160]  this is an authoritarian takeover it is that simple and we're going to be going
[10:27.160 --> 10:33.760]  over that as well huge economic news huge no fly list news preppers now being
[10:33.760 --> 10:38.560]  put on no fly list got an article up at info wars.com London Independent has a
[10:38.560 --> 10:42.680]  very interesting article that I pretty much agree with in my basic historical
[10:42.680 --> 10:52.880]  analysis meet manza Musa of the African Empire that it adjusted dollars would be
[10:52.880 --> 10:56.840]  the richest man in the world history the richest king richest person and who's
[10:56.840 --> 11:04.360]  up number two the Rothschilds oh the 350 billion the Rockefellers with 340
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.880]  billion and the list just goes on and on of course their wealth is actually much
[11:08.880 --> 11:12.760]  greater than that I'm gonna be breaking some of that down for you coming up
[11:12.760 --> 11:18.880]  today the Rothschilds don't like this stuff being known they sued a British
[11:18.880 --> 11:22.840]  newspaper what the Daily Mail a few years ago the Daily Mail was saying that
[11:22.840 --> 11:26.920]  they were this giant kingpin organization and that had all control all these
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.280]  Russian oligarchs and others and British politicians as their fronts and had front
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.200]  companies and they sued them and the judge got mad and said well they've
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.080]  proven the case here in court and basically threw out the Rothschilds suit
[11:39.080 --> 11:50.560]  with prejudice and said that hey you lied to the court I recently was sued
[11:50.560 --> 11:54.000]  and it was a suit was thrown out with prejudice I could sue them and then get
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.720]  a big damages back when when they do throw it out with prejudice but I'm not
[11:57.720 --> 12:01.960]  doing that at this time just because people that are in that type of you know
[12:01.960 --> 12:07.120]  terrible situation whatever reason have already basically done everything to
[12:07.120 --> 12:13.800]  themselves you know it's just bizarre the things that go on out there but
[12:13.800 --> 12:21.200]  Rothschilds suit thrown out with prejudice thrown out with prejudice because
[12:21.200 --> 12:25.080]  they really are that was the headline that came out after they won the suit
[12:25.080 --> 12:31.240]  was you know one by having it thrown out with prejudice was one the rebutt of
[12:31.240 --> 12:37.280]  the suit was they really are no king makers puppet masters puppet masters
[12:37.280 --> 12:41.520]  was the headline so there you go we're gonna be breaking some of that down
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.520]  today here okay top stories let me just get to it right now yes the debate's a
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.320]  dog and pony show yes big mega banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan you can go
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.160]  look at their contributors the same groups are basically behind both men but
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.520]  you've got different camps within those you've got the George Soros totally wants
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.920]  to ban guns totally wants world government once the dollar to die all on
[13:06.920 --> 13:14.000]  record wants to shut down free speech in this country super authoritarian strain
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.160]  you know funds and runs think progress media matters White House transition
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.240]  chief you know runs media matters memos came out two years ago they want to
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.960]  destroy alternative media anything that can resist them and they see you know
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.080]  the drudge report things like that in full wars.com as the enemy that's why
[13:33.080 --> 13:40.200]  they attack us incessantly and it's very creepy and it's like Joseph Farah of
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.880]  worldnet daily worldnet daily.com said a few months ago here on the show he said
[13:43.880 --> 13:47.920]  look I didn't vote for John McCain and I said don't vote for him they're all
[13:47.920 --> 13:53.240]  controlled but he said now we know Obama's moving so quick he said I'm gonna
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.040]  support Mitt Romney we know he's a globalist but he doesn't have the history
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.000]  of going after people's free speech and Joe Farah from his connections and he's
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.880]  in DC he's right outside there in Chantilly been to their facilities that
[14:09.880 --> 14:14.880]  we're gonna be arrested or killed and you've got the re-education camp
[14:14.880 --> 14:19.200]  documents now four months old that only foreign media picked up on the army has
[14:19.200 --> 14:24.400]  it on their own website they use the term re-education camp I mean that is so
[14:24.400 --> 14:28.320]  sensational where is the New York Times where is the Washington Post
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.040]  re-education camps run by the army I showed you army manuals yesterday here
[14:33.040 --> 14:36.800]  on there that say working with local police taking over now they've got
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.600]  checkpoints on highways popping up with TSA and regular army regular Marines
[14:41.600 --> 14:46.600]  with heavy machine guns in the backs of Humvees aiming at cars I mean nothing
[14:46.600 --> 14:53.240]  to do with Al Qaeda all to do with us what is government planning and the word
[14:53.240 --> 14:57.440]  is that if Obama gets back in there's gonna be basically a big false flag
[14:57.440 --> 15:02.240]  maybe even before and that they plan to go after their opposition that has
[15:02.240 --> 15:12.320]  always been the plan now continuing here ladies and gentlemen you've got this
[15:12.320 --> 15:18.800]  whole backdrop happening and I have attack Mitt Romney I'm not gonna go and
[15:18.800 --> 15:21.640]  vote plus there's no real voting in Travis County where I live it's been
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.000]  proven certified a fraud many times I've gone to the County Commissioners they
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.240]  have had the state board back in 98 admit it was fraud but said it can just go
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.680]  forward so there's no voting here anyways where I live that's why it's
[15:32.680 --> 15:37.040]  we're under such UN tyranny that's why we're the UN model city about a takeover
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.760]  government internationally because Congress won't sell us out completely
[15:40.760 --> 15:43.840]  they've just come in and taken over I mean it's just unbelievable the
[15:43.840 --> 15:47.320]  corporate looting they have here raising property taxes to give the money to the
[15:47.320 --> 15:51.120]  University of Texas to give it to formula one race tracks to give it to
[15:51.120 --> 15:57.040]  I mean it's just unbelievable what I live under but continuing here we're
[15:57.040 --> 16:06.000]  sitting here watching all this tyranny unfold and the question is do you just
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.440]  want to let Obama drive it into high gear or do you want Mitt Romney to kind
[16:11.440 --> 16:14.280]  of slow it down a little bit but you still keep rolling forward and
[16:14.280 --> 16:19.480]  everybody goes to sleep and then the tyranny solidifies or do you have Obama
[16:19.480 --> 16:22.840]  get back in and have it get really bad and hope people finally wake up out of
[16:22.840 --> 16:28.160]  their coma I don't know okay I just know at a animal level at an instinctive
[16:28.160 --> 16:35.120]  level watching that rig debate last night and watching Crowley Alistair
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.800]  Crowley up there the moderator or whatever her name is whatever its name
[16:38.800 --> 16:49.520]  is candy Crowley sit there and interrupt over and over again and and lie and
[16:49.520 --> 16:54.680]  twist and to symbol it was like watching two people in a boxing ring fighting
[16:54.680 --> 16:58.600]  another person it even if you don't like the guy they're fighting if there's two
[16:58.600 --> 17:01.560]  boxers attacking another boxer you automatically are for the underdog I
[17:01.560 --> 17:08.360]  mean it's rigged it's disgusting and if America doesn't realize that was a rig
[17:08.360 --> 17:13.240]  debate and Romney still barely won I don't know what to say I mean it again
[17:13.240 --> 17:19.080]  it's not so much whether I'm for Obama or Romney it's that the spectacle of how
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.960]  rigged of the game is and how rigged the system is and that and that the CNN run
[17:24.960 --> 17:32.200]  debate was absolutely pro Obama all the way and there wasn't even the the the
[17:32.200 --> 17:36.760]  attempt to act like it wasn't completely partisanly skewed of the
[17:36.760 --> 17:43.000]  Democrats you start asking well I mean am I wrong to not be supporting Romney
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.480]  if the power structure doesn't want him in those are questions there like I said
[17:49.480 --> 17:53.240]  I don't have voting I live in Travis County we don't have voting here it's
[17:53.240 --> 17:58.080]  been proven I'm run by the UN I mean I moved out of Travis County it's a great
[17:58.080 --> 18:02.800]  county wonderful place I'm not knocking Austin Texas it's my favorite city in
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.960]  Texas it's just that I you know I have moved outside of it to at least have
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.120]  lower property taxes they take property taxes here and also make you pay for
[18:10.120 --> 18:13.800]  abortions part of the hospital district only County in Texas that does that so
[18:13.800 --> 18:19.560]  I've moved out of Austin but but still I come into it and and it's it's weird to
[18:19.560 --> 18:23.760]  drive into a UN occupied city the UN brags that it's under UN control we've
[18:23.760 --> 18:28.000]  done news reports and says there that Austin is a UN city and we're under you
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.440]  in control I mean I live in an occupied city by the UN itself not just
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.960]  occupied America under the globalist and under the federal government itself
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.680]  sold out to the new world order I live in an actual occupied city I'm always
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.040]  digressing because there's no teleprompters there's no talking points
[18:43.040 --> 18:46.480]  I've got just news stacked to the rafters coming up in the next segment I'll
[18:46.480 --> 18:51.320]  start getting into it then Washington Times reporter senior reporter Joseph
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.880]  Curl that was there he's gonna be on he's got his headline story I just tweeted
[18:55.880 --> 18:59.920]  out at real Alex Jones Crowley skews hard for Obama in disastrous
[18:59.920 --> 19:05.680]  presidential debate and it was disastrous I mean it was it was Forbes
[19:05.680 --> 19:10.640]  is calling it sickening because it was so much interrupting and so much
[19:10.640 --> 19:17.080]  cheating by Obama and Crowley and then and then they just basically threw
[19:17.080 --> 19:20.240]  themselves on him trying to push him up against the ropes I mean it was it was a
[19:20.240 --> 19:26.280]  terrible boxing match but they're the ones that get it and we've got horrible
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.960]  you know comments by Obama saying yeah he's coming after our guns that's
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.200]  official wants to ban all semi-autos and he wants to outside of law just ban
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.320]  people government says you're mentally ill no judge no jury no they just say it
[19:38.320 --> 19:43.320]  you're on a list you don't get guns like a no-fly list and no gun by list and
[19:43.320 --> 19:47.520]  then you've got the lesser of two evils there cheerleading gunmans Romney
[19:47.520 --> 19:52.440]  totally disgusting and then you've got all the death threats I haven't gotten to

[24:18.440 --> 24:23.800]  correspondent at the debates last night he'll be joining us to give us his take
[24:23.800 --> 24:29.240]  on it and then we're gonna get into the second hour and I'll play I don't want
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.440]  to just play clips I'm gonna play like five six seven eight minute chunks we've
[24:32.440 --> 24:37.120]  got a couple chunks here where you can hear the whole assault weapons ban
[24:37.120 --> 24:41.200]  restrict the Second Amendment back and forth from both of them and it tells you
[24:41.200 --> 24:44.880]  where the attempt to restrict the Second Amendment is going and it's spot on
[24:44.880 --> 24:49.720]  from our analysis so this is good intel and then we've got obviously the big
[24:49.720 --> 24:52.120]  story
[24:52.960 --> 24:57.360]  Crowley totally trying to throw the debate to Obama and I think it's gonna
[24:57.360 --> 25:01.440]  backfire on them if people have any brain cells left we're starting to see that
[25:01.440 --> 25:07.840]  Obama like a little kid or like a collectivist says getting that true candy
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.240]  and I noticed he kept waiting and going go ahead governor go ahead and say more
[25:12.240 --> 25:17.120]  while he was trying to set him up because I knew back when he said in the
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.200]  Rose Garden the day after the ambassador was killed the media made a huge you
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.560]  know deal out of it and both sides try to politically capitalize on it I
[25:25.560 --> 25:29.200]  remember him just saying we will not be deterred you know we will not be scared
[25:29.200 --> 25:35.480]  by terror in a long rambling statement but he had all his surrogates out on TV
[25:35.480 --> 25:41.240]  and for two weeks it was a big national story you know you heard it saying that
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.720]  no it was not a terror attack it was not organized it was a protest that got
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.560]  out of hand and now Hillary's had to apologize and they're saying it's
[25:49.560 --> 25:52.880]  al-qaeda you know I point out well why'd you put al-qaeda in there to begin
[25:52.880 --> 25:57.320]  with why is that not being looked at but the point is
[25:57.320 --> 26:03.600]  Crowley said no no Obama's right knowing that that most people watching
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.000]  don't read newspapers 23% now read newspapers and that they just now
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.080]  believes that ooh ooh Romney's an idiot Romney got got schooled all because
[26:16.080 --> 26:19.040]  they're playing semantical games and they're literally hundreds of articles
[26:19.040 --> 26:24.040]  if you just type in Obama says attack was terror Mitt Romney says Obama didn't
[26:24.040 --> 26:29.960]  call Libya a terror attack get smacked down that's the George Soros having in
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.160]  post well now AOL moved on up the chain and it just goes on and on with
[26:35.160 --> 26:41.440]  headlines and articles saying fact check see it in yep Crowley was right and
[26:41.440 --> 26:46.720]  Obama was right next they're gonna tell you the moons made of cheese they can
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.280]  only get away with this because they've got a population that doesn't know
[26:51.280 --> 26:58.560]  anything anything I mean it was two weeks I'm a radio talk show I do a
[26:58.560 --> 27:04.480]  nightly news show I live news and I got sick of the debate for two weeks them
[27:04.480 --> 27:09.560]  saying oh this wasn't coordinated this wasn't this this wasn't that on and on
[27:09.560 --> 27:12.600]  I don't talk radio listeners you know this has been all that's been talked
[27:12.600 --> 27:18.120]  about pretty much the last month and for two weeks of it they kept denying and
[27:18.120 --> 27:21.880]  saying it wasn't organized of course it was organized with big anti-tank guns
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.360]  and anti-aircraft guns and hundreds of guys in a huge bat you know pitch battle
[27:26.360 --> 27:36.440]  Alamo style deal but they somehow are now spinning it that oh yeah it was this
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.160]  is the rewriting of history we're witnessing right now it's amazing how
[27:40.160 --> 27:43.880]  this is done so that they're rigging this just like they rigged the debate and
[27:43.880 --> 27:47.920]  again I'm not here saying I love Mitt Romney it's just to watch them gang up
[27:47.920 --> 27:54.520]  she interrupted him I've got the numbers here what is it 28 times and she only
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.520]  interrupted Obama 9 I watched the debate those weren't really interruptions
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.680]  that was shutting him down in fact Breitbart says it's it's 28 times it was
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.360]  more than that I mean it was just a he was like a lawyer interrupting somebody
[28:06.360 --> 28:09.640]  on the witness stand where they can't even talk just objecting objecting
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.680]  objecting objecting objecting objecting and interrupting and confusing and
[28:13.680 --> 28:17.080]  dissembling and trying to get Romney off balance I don't think it really worked
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.640]  overall but it did cloud things what's a squid do when it's scared it squirts out
[28:21.640 --> 28:28.480]  ink and just tried to cloud everything where and then lie to people here is the
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.280]  US ambassador Susan Rice the UN one of literally hundreds of clips of their
[28:33.280 --> 28:38.080]  minions saying that it was not a coordinated terror attack here it is
[28:38.080 --> 28:43.160]  I'm sorry what's your name it's Kerry yeah hold on just a moment he says this
[28:43.160 --> 28:46.760]  is something's been in the planning stages for months I understand you have
[28:46.760 --> 28:50.880]  been saying that you think it was spontaneous are we not on the same page
[28:50.880 --> 28:55.360]  here well Bob let me tell you what we understand to be the assessment at
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.040]  present first of all very importantly as you discussed with the president there
[28:59.040 --> 29:03.400]  is a investigation that the United States government will launch led by the FBI
[29:03.400 --> 29:07.800]  that has begun and not they're not on the ground yet but they have already
[29:07.800 --> 29:12.600]  begun looking at all sorts of evidence of various sorts already available to
[29:12.600 --> 29:16.400]  them and to us and they will get on the ground and continue the investigation
[29:16.400 --> 29:20.120]  so we'll want to see the results of that investigation to draw any definitive
[29:20.120 --> 29:25.400]  conclusions but based on the best information we have to date what our
[29:25.400 --> 29:31.200]  assessment is as of the present is in fact what it began spontaneously in
[29:31.200 --> 29:36.960]  Benghazi as a reaction to what it transpired some hours earlier in Cairo
[29:36.960 --> 29:42.080]  okay of course as you know he says it over and over again not a terror attack
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.400]  not a terror attack but now they only said it was a terror attack and you
[29:46.400 --> 29:51.240]  just need to go back to sleep and drink your fluoride we're on the march the

[34:09.160 --> 34:13.640]  got Obama saying yes he wants to ban semi-automatics period he wants to the
[34:13.640 --> 34:17.240]  assault weapons ban and that he wants to be able to just say people are mentally
[34:17.240 --> 34:21.120]  ill no judge no jury just put you want to know gun by list that his former
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.880]  Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said was one of their main goals four years ago in
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.040]  the campaign so he is anti-gun he wants your guns he says you have a right to a
[34:31.040 --> 34:34.400]  second amendment that right is to turn your guns into the government we're
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.680]  going to be getting into that in the next hour and playing large clips of the
[34:38.680 --> 34:44.440]  debate and breaking down Susan Rice the ambassador of the UN the US ambassador
[34:44.440 --> 34:49.320]  the UN saying it was not terror that was said by hundreds of surrogates it was
[34:49.320 --> 34:55.080]  said all over the place until they got into Congress and then Congress people
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.240]  didn't want to lie under testimony from the State Department so they said yes
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.680]  it was a coordinated organized attack yeah with any tank guns any aircraft
[35:02.680 --> 35:07.560]  guns hundreds of people but Obama in his rose garden speech just said America
[35:07.560 --> 35:11.640]  will stand up you know to terror but he didn't call this terror it was in a
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.560]  rambling speech about terror and about what happened there at the consulate
[35:17.560 --> 35:23.840]  but but saying that that didn't appear to be coordinated and Candy Crowley of
[35:23.840 --> 35:29.560]  CNN clearly tried to throw the entire thing to Obama I mean I was I was
[35:29.560 --> 35:38.000]  watching it she interrupted 28 times to the nine times that she interrupted
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.960]  Obama Obama was constantly interrupting constantly lying it looked like two
[35:44.960 --> 35:50.720]  boxers against one boxer in some type of rigged fight and I think it's starting
[35:50.720 --> 35:54.000]  to backfire on them but none of the Huffington Post has their way and others
[35:54.000 --> 36:01.120]  they're saying quote Romney got smacked down saying that Obama never said that
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.640]  it wasn't terror for two weeks on record it was a big national controversy they
[36:05.640 --> 36:14.560]  said that it was not an act of terror now they're saying they never said that and
[36:14.560 --> 36:18.680]  that it was terror all along just amazing how dumb they think we are and to
[36:18.680 --> 36:22.080]  break this down and other anomalies he's got a great article out today at the
[36:22.080 --> 36:26.720]  Washington Times I tweeted it out at the real Alex Jones tweet and I think it's
[36:26.720 --> 36:30.440]  also linked up at drudgereport.com but washingtontimes.com has the
[36:30.440 --> 36:38.800]  excellent article by Joseph Curl Crowley skews hard for Obama in disastrous
[36:38.800 --> 36:43.840]  presidential debate and he goes over it and he was at the debate last night Joe
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.680]  thanks for coming on I know you're a busy guy there break down what you thought
[36:49.680 --> 36:54.920]  overall and other facets I haven't gotten into and where you think this is
[36:54.920 --> 37:00.080]  going with this debate being so rigged well I thought you know one of the things
[37:00.080 --> 37:03.720]  that there's there's all the things that you talked about the training
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.680]  interruptions tonight for for well Romney the the way she kind of you know
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.000]  spoke over Romney when he was trying to get here he just claimed his build fun
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.240]  but I thought with you with the extraordinary thing was at last night
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.640]  was that it was questions from the supposedly undecided people now how you
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.520]  find you know any more undecided people this way into the process I don't know
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.440]  but you're also finding him in Hempstead New York so I imagine you know 90% of
[37:31.440 --> 37:35.720]  these people voted for Obama last night and I'm telling the pollster Dallas hey
[37:35.720 --> 37:40.960]  I'm undecided but you know New York is 90% Democrat anyway but but any sort of
[37:40.960 --> 37:45.280]  everything was candy Crowley had the right to pitch her own questions she
[37:45.280 --> 37:50.120]  sees these people wrote their questions her card gave her the candy Crowley and
[37:50.120 --> 37:55.640]  then she decided what the topics were and that's an extraordinary power that she
[37:55.640 --> 38:00.200]  had last night I mean she picked topics that were clearly by far has a story of
[38:00.200 --> 38:04.480]  today saying you know they they skewed two to one in favor of Obama but there
[38:04.480 --> 38:09.800]  were questions about outsourcing which is basically just you know a hanging
[38:09.800 --> 38:15.080]  curve all for Obama to get into a bank apple she had a question about women's
[38:15.080 --> 38:19.640]  rights and you know that opened up for Obama's a little bit of saying the
[38:19.640 --> 38:24.560]  quality of pay cut you know insurance names of contraception care about
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.360]  immigration that that really sort of favors Obama in that you know it's
[38:29.360 --> 38:34.000]  bound these plans is more unpopular and harder to get through the other thing
[38:34.000 --> 38:46.880]  that is there was a couple of chairs and you would think Joe hold on one
[38:46.880 --> 38:52.240]  moment to get to a better spot I know you're out out there driving and we're
[38:52.240 --> 38:55.040]  there covering it and you're bringing up some really good points I'm waiting to
[38:55.040 --> 38:58.960]  get to a better cell area or we may reconnect with you but yeah I mean there's
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.920]  so many facets to this watching it you could tell the questions were skewed
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.760]  she was interrupting and then of course the big finale's Obama it's not right
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.720]  candy yeah you're right he's wrong this appeal to authority knowing it was all
[39:12.720 --> 39:18.320]  pure bull I mean it was I've never seen a debate this rigged Obama got more time
[39:18.320 --> 39:25.480]  what 9% more time I mean right I mean I mean why not why not put a gag in in
[39:25.480 --> 39:33.120]  Mitt Romney's mouth that last part that you mentioned was extraordinary it was
[39:33.120 --> 39:38.120]  it was Romney asking Obama a question you didn't call it terror in that first
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.160]  speech you gave did you and Obama said well please proceed over and then he
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.320]  said no but seriously did you or did you not and and Obama said check the
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.720]  transcript and suddenly Candy Crowley jumps in and says no no it's in the
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.960]  transcripts he did call it terror it turned out that was completely false but
[39:55.960 --> 40:00.120]  what's amazing is she just told it to 60 million people and the fact check today
[40:00.120 --> 40:04.320]  will be read by a couple of million people so last night everyone who turned
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.160]  off that TV at 1030 went oh well you know Romney's making some scurrilous
[40:09.160 --> 40:13.080]  accusation that he never called the terror they spent 10 days not calling it
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.960]  terror and as you pointed out only called it terror once they got to the
[40:16.960 --> 40:20.560]  State Department and if they don't call it terror at that point then they're
[40:20.560 --> 40:25.680]  really in a process of moving toward perjury and and lying to the Congress
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.560]  which is in the you know and remember how they changed their entire story they
[40:29.560 --> 40:33.600]  gave us one whole story right before the State Department went down to testify
[40:33.600 --> 40:37.120]  they gave it a complete they called reporters out you know that night nine
[40:37.120 --> 40:40.960]  o'clock at night to tell a completely different story because they were about
[40:40.960 --> 40:44.800]  to go and tell Congress that well sometimes sometimes Joe we're talking
[40:44.800 --> 40:48.440]  to Joe Curl the Washington Times Washington Times commies I one of
[40:48.440 --> 40:51.200]  their senior reporters there and of course as their correspondence the
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.120]  White House this is this is amazing though because I mean how dumb do they
[40:56.120 --> 41:00.680]  think the public is some days they were changing their story I remember they
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.040]  changed it three times in one day even mainstream dinosaur media admitted they
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.400]  were flip-flopping and were caught in a big scandal and now they're trying to
[41:10.400 --> 41:16.080]  rewrite history with this fraud I mean this is a fraud saying that they always
[41:16.080 --> 41:21.960]  said it was terror when we've got all their surrogates on television arguing
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.400]  saying no it was not terror it was not terror it was a protest that got out of
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.320]  hand with any aircraft guns
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.600]  I'm sure you're listening to have read that if they have a patient they need to
[41:36.600 --> 41:40.200]  read that riveting account that the State Department gave out the night before
[41:40.200 --> 41:43.480]  the congressional testimony because they told a completely different story they
[41:43.480 --> 41:48.640]  told the story of heavily armed men, hundreds of them pouring over that
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.000]  knife-foot stench with three feet of barbed wire straining into that compound
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.040]  nothing at all like like the first story they told which was oh it was a you
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.960]  know it was a raucous protest of this film that was you know on YouTube posted
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.240]  in June that no one's ever seen and then suddenly it turned violent after what
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.280]  was happening in Egypt it was it was an absurd story and they had to take it back
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.840]  but but even more than that you know Jay Carney was it was day after day in the
[42:15.840 --> 42:19.800]  White House brand briefing room asked well is it a terrorist attack and wouldn't
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.240]  say it until the State Department guy testified said well of course it was an
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.400]  act of terror then Jay Carney asked again at the briefing room said well of
[42:28.400 --> 42:31.960]  course it was an act of terror it was of course an act of terror and everybody
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.480]  knew it within hours even the White House and there are reports now that they
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.520]  were hearing things within 24 hours that this was an act of terror even more
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.240]  amazing is we still won't know and the State Department has never told us what
[42:46.240 --> 42:51.440]  happened to the ambassador apparently they didn't even know where he was when
[42:51.440 --> 42:55.160]  he got to the hospital they only found out when doctors took his cell phone and
[42:55.160 --> 42:59.320]  started calling recently called numbers and then five then they went oh you know
[42:59.320 --> 43:04.120]  we got the US ambassador here nobody knows how he got there we've got that
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.800]  crazy picture of Olivia dragging him is holding a cell phone in his mouth we
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.720]  don't know if he's helping him or if they're dragging his body through the
[43:11.720 --> 43:16.200]  streets as we heard early early on we don't know the rest of that story and
[43:16.200 --> 43:21.600]  apparently this seems to be the way Hillary Clinton talking about it she's
[43:21.600 --> 43:24.360]  got to wait until the investigation is over so they're of course gonna wait
[43:24.360 --> 43:29.920]  until after this election before they really tell us what happened I'm just
[43:29.920 --> 43:36.120]  blown away I mean is it just me Joe or is the lying just in politics generally
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.560]  getting more and more bold more and more out of control I mean this level of
[43:40.560 --> 43:46.000]  public lying and the media going along with these frauds would make Bill
[43:46.000 --> 43:52.920]  Clinton blush or am I and think of what's just happened on on Sunday you
[43:52.920 --> 43:56.640]  know it started to happen I guess Saturday they they got to the father
[43:56.640 --> 44:01.080]  Christopher the ambassador's father who said don't politicize this there's
[44:01.080 --> 44:05.720]  so many cultures where we're filled with Obama surrogates saying well you're
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.280]  just politicizing this this is just all politics this wasn't a big issue until
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.480]  you know Romney and Ryan got their hands on and started politicizing it so
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.400]  you're right and this is this is now lying openly and then when you get pressed
[44:20.400 --> 44:24.280]  against the wall and you actually have to start admitting some of your fault
[44:24.280 --> 44:29.000]  is then you just turn around and call it politicize politicizing it or you just
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.920]  say that you all that there never was a controversy and you always said it was
[44:31.920 --> 44:35.960]  terror a new day one what it was there's also this statement we're gonna play it
[44:35.960 --> 44:39.000]  the next hour after you're gone but I know you you were there in person
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.640]  watching it Joe curl joining us here what did you make of Obama saying I will
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.400]  never politicize the war on terror when he's done this big production over the
[44:48.400 --> 44:52.680]  killing of bin Laden and they've got you know Hollywood producers in their day
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.840]  one scripting the release of it and everything and then just just I mean
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.160]  I've never seen such ball face line but see that's it that's that's the
[45:01.160 --> 45:05.120]  fantastic thing about about the Democrats it's okay if the Democrats do it
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.680]  but then if the Republicans begin to ask questions about what you know what
[45:09.680 --> 45:14.080]  really went on there then the politicizing it it's you know it's
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.360]  it's shocking the way they're even even the way they they couched in the
[45:19.360 --> 45:23.800]  language I mean they tell us weeks later that they were they were providing us
[45:23.800 --> 45:28.000]  only the information they had at the time and they complained about Mitt Romney
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.200]  shooting shooting at the hip shooting too quickly what in fact they're telling
[45:32.200 --> 45:35.320]  us this story that turns out to be completely wrong they're telling us a
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.720]  spontaneous protest they're out there telling us that the top officials are
[45:40.720 --> 45:45.560]  telling America that's what happened it over a video they then have to turn
[45:45.560 --> 45:49.680]  around and say not over a video and it wasn't spontaneous and it was actually
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.480]  heavily armed terrorists and not a couple of guys just out there angry about
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.240]  backing up exactly what Mitt Romney said but then Mitt Romney still even worse
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.840]  for being right now shifting gears in this whole area about your article gets
[46:03.840 --> 46:08.200]  into a whole laundry list of how they skewed it do you think Joe Curle that
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.920]  that this is gonna backfire on them or will they get away with this because
[46:11.920 --> 46:15.640]  obviously there's been a lot of discussion about the fact that these
[46:15.640 --> 46:19.560]  debates you know had a lot of partisanship and we're rigged now that
[46:19.560 --> 46:24.320]  we've seen the most rigged debate that I've ever seen in my life I mean is this
[46:24.320 --> 46:27.520]  just the new way it's gonna work I mean maybe maybe they'll give the
[46:27.520 --> 46:32.160]  conservative or the Republican one minute and then the Democrat gets an
[46:32.160 --> 46:38.800]  hour and 29 minutes it's extraordinary to go to these events actually be in the
[46:38.800 --> 46:42.400]  room because the first word is so fantastic and liberal I was sitting in
[46:42.400 --> 46:47.320]  the at Hofstra in the in the press filing center surrounded by people that
[46:47.320 --> 46:52.240]  were tackling it everything that Romney said and and then you know like even
[46:52.240 --> 46:56.320]  cheering when when when Obama said there was a point where Obama said
[46:56.320 --> 46:59.320]  something about you know his pension fund saying you know it might let venture
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.560]  funds out of these years and the whole place erupted in laughter and cheers so
[47:03.560 --> 47:08.840]  this is this is the real media the media is there cheering on their guy and you
[47:08.840 --> 47:11.840]  know it's good it does take the Republicans are the Republicans have
[47:11.840 --> 47:15.520]  known this and you know that it's from from from all the things you do you know
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.440]  it's always going to be harder for the Republicans to get their voices heard to
[47:19.440 --> 47:25.280]  get through this massive media filter so they're gonna have to just keep at it
[47:25.280 --> 47:28.960]  and I think you know Rob that's why Romney really kind of went down last
[47:28.960 --> 47:32.680]  night but even after the debate all of these liberal reporters that I was
[47:32.680 --> 47:37.120]  talking to they were all saying you know this is gonna backfire on them this you
[47:37.120 --> 47:40.040]  know they've just brought up the Libya thing this whole terrorist thing you
[47:40.040 --> 47:43.360]  know this this is the main story tomorrow and I have seen some of the
[47:43.360 --> 47:47.320]  morning cable networks they've they've been talking about it it became a big
[47:47.320 --> 47:52.400]  story it's um so they get called out on things but but look how egregious it has
[47:52.400 --> 47:57.360]  to be it has to be so so you think it is you think it is being there and you're
[47:57.360 --> 48:01.040]  saying even the Democratic operative exposing his journalists they they were
[48:01.040 --> 48:05.280]  even upset knowing that it was such an outrageous lie that it's gonna backfire
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.280]  oh yeah they were grudgingly admitting last night that well you know that's
[48:10.280 --> 48:14.400]  gonna be a big story tomorrow because you know all of us within within seconds
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.840]  we we all Google the president's speech on September 12th and day after the attack
[48:18.840 --> 48:23.560]  we all stand through it to see him say what happened in Bengali was a terrorist
[48:23.560 --> 48:26.880]  attack and he didn't say that he said we're not gonna let acts of terror
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.680]  for us in our world why try to blah blah blah you can't call it global terrorism
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.000]  or or you know extremely you know it was a general proviso look they knew they
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.520]  were lying they're not gonna allow you know acts of terror but that's not
[48:42.520 --> 48:47.240]  calling what happened in Bengali that terror which they then proceeded for you
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.560]  know up to 10 days to deny was back up there now how they can put to that and
[48:51.560 --> 48:55.120]  say well we said you know I said it that night that day hey on September 12th
[48:55.120 --> 48:59.320]  that's just not true and I think even the liberal reporters last night said
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.840]  well this was not gonna work out so well for their moral people we're talking to
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.960]  Joe curl whites for the Washington Times he has his article out today it's
[49:07.960 --> 49:12.560]  excellent Crowley skews hard for Obama in disastrous presidential debate you
[49:12.560 --> 49:15.920]  can read it up at info wars.com we have it linked there in the guest area
[49:15.920 --> 49:19.280]  obviously also at washington times.com we've only got him to the end of the
[49:19.280 --> 49:22.240]  hour about another 10 minutes here Joe we appreciate your time you've got to go
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.100]  to a bunch of different events to cover today and you're traveling right
[49:25.100 --> 49:31.200]  now what do you make of other tidbits because there was so much rigging I don't
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.040]  even know where to start what are some other areas we haven't talked about here
[49:34.040 --> 49:39.800]  that you noticed. Well I mean I know that back to the questions that
[49:39.800 --> 49:44.080]  Candy Crowley got to ask and she's you know she again looking through any
[49:44.080 --> 49:48.880]  questions you can take any topic she wants there was an extraordinary question
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.360]  where she called a woman who said you know I'm really concerned and learned
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.480]  about the Bush administration I didn't like that much and their policies
[49:57.480 --> 50:03.640]  their international policies how are you different from George Bush and how
[50:03.640 --> 50:07.200]  would you in your presidency differentiate yourself from George Bush now
[50:07.200 --> 50:13.080]  how that's a question to two candidates is beyond me it basically gave its
[50:13.080 --> 50:19.200]  force it's forces Romney to defend the Bush years he's not George Bush but now
[50:19.200 --> 50:22.560]  all of a sudden he's connected to George Bush in this question and then it gives
[50:22.560 --> 50:28.440]  Obama a full two minutes to say all of the things that remember he's constantly
[50:28.440 --> 50:32.920]  everything is George Bush's fault. Sure it takes him back four years ago when he
[50:32.920 --> 50:37.240]  was running against Bush's record as the Savior it rewinds and kind of activates
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.920]  all those you know memories out there one more segment with Joe Curle straight
[50:41.920 --> 50:44.760]  ahead I'm gonna bring up an issue that's linked up at DrudgeReport.com

[54:22.800 --> 54:26.760]  course been a White House correspondent for many years as well we're almost out
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.320]  of time here I want to move quick what do you make of creators syndicate and
[54:31.320 --> 54:36.000]  other publications reporting for a week and a half the threats to riot if
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.640]  Romney wins and then we start writing about it and now it's been attacked by
[54:41.640 --> 54:46.200]  you know the George Soros crowd the media matters the think progress all
[54:46.200 --> 54:50.080]  these legends in their own minds they were saying yesterday and a bunch of
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.040]  articles that I'm just basically making all this up there's literally thousands
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.160]  of Twitter's and Facebook's we can't even keep track of them all during the
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.000]  debate last night it was you know we're gonna kill Romney we're gonna kill him
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.200]  show we put an article out it's up at drudgereport.com right now threats to
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.360]  assassinate Romney explode after debate and they're still saying that we're
[55:10.360 --> 55:15.160]  being bad to point this out look I've been visited by the Secret Service for
[55:15.160 --> 55:19.960]  for listeners making mild comments on the radio that don't even approach one
[55:19.960 --> 55:23.520]  tenth of this so I want to know where's the double standard what do you think
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.840]  about this job well that didn't I mean that's not to get another amazing thing
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.800]  as you thank you even even complain about you know Barack Obama
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.920]  specifically you'll get a little bit from the Secret Service I really wonder
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.280]  like we've been seeing these stories now for a few days and and the Twitter feed
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.400]  like you're saying it's just it's just a torrent of of threatening more and more
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.600]  stuff pouring out the same kind of thing I'm wondering what the Secret Service
[55:50.600 --> 55:54.840]  does and I really think you know reporters are again they're gonna
[55:54.840 --> 55:58.040]  ignore this but they can't ignore for very long and somebody's gonna call up
[55:58.040 --> 56:01.680]  the Secret Service at some point and say what are you guys doing and they're
[56:01.680 --> 56:05.640]  gonna have to get all this this case because there's so many things going on
[56:05.640 --> 56:09.480]  this guy with Romney Republican candidate for president kind of Secret
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.760]  Service protection you know they need the security last night at hospital and
[56:13.760 --> 56:19.520]  that's really extraordinary was like a like an army camp there but I can't I
[56:19.520 --> 56:24.240]  can't imagine why the Secret Service and already on this and why other
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.880]  reporters aren't hard following this you know if it is just think about it
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.040]  put it to candidate in a lot more getting desperate we would get that
[56:33.040 --> 56:38.720]  story done stop absolutely your phone again on the road Joe Kerl Washington
[56:38.720 --> 56:44.400]  Times fading out a bit it's gonna come back here just a moment hopefully again
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.680]  I restate the last thing you were saying about Obama just imagine if this
[56:48.680 --> 56:53.480]  were Barack Obama a candidate Obama in 2008 getting getting death threats on
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.840]  Twitter not thousands just hundreds and hundreds the Secret Service would have
[56:58.840 --> 57:02.200]  been all over that and the press corps of course that would have been a daily
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.400]  story for as long as it took to get to the bottom of it and whether you'll
[57:06.400 --> 57:12.560]  get rest all these people threatening I had the FBI two years ago it was three
[57:12.560 --> 57:17.600]  years ago now asked me what my Obama poster meant and all it is is Obama and
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.560]  says the Obama deception right outside that control room they said what's that
[57:21.560 --> 57:27.240]  poster mean I've had the FBI here asking me about a film I made about Obama that
[57:27.240 --> 57:32.240]  doesn't call for any violence but then George Soros his group is like how dare
[57:32.240 --> 57:36.760]  us point out why are they allowed all these people on Twitter and Facebook to
[57:36.760 --> 57:41.960]  call for Mitt Romney's death I mean it's just an amazing double standard yeah and
[57:41.960 --> 57:47.240]  again when you then walk in the press corps which is not interested in it
[57:47.240 --> 57:50.280]  doesn't care about it's not going to ask any questions not going to make any
[57:50.280 --> 57:55.200]  phone call they just they just let that story disappear and it's the kind of
[57:55.200 --> 57:59.680]  thing that you really have to wonder you know is this okay if because you're
[57:59.680 --> 58:05.400]  a Republican or or you know why why doesn't the press corps again this is
[58:05.400 --> 58:10.840]  just a story a torrent of death threats how can they not find that a story on
[58:10.840 --> 58:15.080]  any candidate well I'm glad you're here talking about them I'm glad drudge
[58:15.080 --> 58:19.200]  report comms link to it one of its cop stories it's up an info wars comm this
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.160]  is only a 60-second break and I know you've got to go but I want to ask you
[58:22.160 --> 58:27.160]  what you think's gonna happen if Obama does get reelected what he'll do in four
[58:27.160 --> 58:31.720]  years versus if Romney gets elected will there be riots because that's also
[58:31.720 --> 58:35.840]  being ignored thousands of tweets you name it threatening to riot and burn
[58:35.840 --> 58:40.760]  down cities if Obama is not reelected

[1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:30.320]  Washington Times a political reporter White House correspondent Joe curls our
[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:34.960]  guest for just five more minutes and he's got to go his article is excellent
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:38.600]  breaking down the rigged event and again we were talking off air he was
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:42.320]  saying it's like a sports team even if you don't like the other team even if
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:45.440]  you know we didn't like Romney when they're getting cheated you're like
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:51.200]  hey these are bad calls and I've never seen the system so desperate
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:58.440]  finishing up here Joe where do you see it going if well if there's a real
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:03.560]  election who do you think is going to win a B if Obama does lose do you think
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:08.120]  people will carry out these threats to riot
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:12.120]  well you're on your second one and then with the same Twitter and stuff I mean
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:15.320]  you know these are these are things that again are moving on Twitter and you know
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:18.480]  distance this was those kind of words you can search them very easily you know
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:23.360]  I'm gonna riot we should all riot if Obama if Obama loses it's you know these
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:28.680]  are threats that are out there and again you know I wonder if if anyone local
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:32.160]  police forces you can determine if anyone is following through on these
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:35.600]  things they're easily traceable if you want to trace them and I think you know I
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:40.160]  think closer election day I hope you know both sides are going to be calling
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:44.400]  for him to come I mean that's what makes America great is we
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:49.000]  transfer power with with no violence with with no struggle that's that's what
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.400]  we've done for Jordan in 25 years I hope both sides will be calling for calm
[1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:58.640]  whatever the the after and that that may mean that you know the Democrats and
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:02.400]  Barack Obama have got to do more of that if they're the ones threatening to
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:07.400]  to riot maybe they'll have to do more of those calls for calm and acceptance of
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:12.360]  whatever happens on election day Joe curl what's your gut tell you or looking at
[1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:17.640]  the polls Romney is closed in some polls as you know Rasmussen gone above who do
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:23.520]  you think's gonna win in your gut well I think the polls are on leaning toward
[1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:27.600]  Obama now I would I'm sorry to Romney now he's picking up on the thing that I
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:34.200]  keep watching is not only the Democrats are taking up Hispanics women blue collar
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:40.960]  workers you know some blacks he's got you know 10 to 11% black Hispanics not
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:44.600]  only that but then starting to watch where Obama is going when he starts
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:49.840]  going to places like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa that means they're
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:53.600]  internal polls and again you know the the extra polls are skewed let me see
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:59.760]  doing polls that have you know 19% more Democrats than Republicans and I'll show
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:04.120]  Obama up by four points what Obama's doing is making him to go to Wisconsin is
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:08.440]  his internal polls which are not skewed are saying hey we're in real jeopardy
[1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:13.480]  here in Wisconsin and in places like you know Pennsylvania's now a four-point
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:18.360]  race right there that's that's it sure well I mean they always create and the
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:23.320]  dinosaur media always creates the illusion of the bandwagon and that's
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:26.080]  how they hope to get people to you know kind of go with who they think's gonna
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:30.720]  win and I agree we just saw Obama change his schedule around and shift where he's
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:35.640]  going I think that signals the panic button yeah I think the other thing
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:38.720]  that we'll see in the next week we've only got 20 days left the other thing
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:43.320]  that we'll have to see eventually is if the media is going to you know look
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:48.000]  okay after this like they weren't skewed and biased they're gonna have to start
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.880]  actually representing the truth I mean if they already know Obama's losing by
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:57.040]  five points watch how the media starts to sort of move toward that message like
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:00.560]  well you know Romney's really opening the lead it's like well you know that
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:06.640]  we've been there for probably months and months and you guys just haven't seen it the bottom line is when
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:11.560]  there are always other sided voters that means they are there not backing the guy
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:16.200]  they voted for only 27% really in most of the polls are going for Obama he won
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:21.920]  with 53% that means 6% are undecided they're not voting for him again but
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:26.040]  they haven't been persuaded enough by mid-nobby what we're starting to see
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:30.160]  right now is they're breaking hard for mid-nobby they did not break back to
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:34.400]  to Barack Obama sure and by the way in these tweets almost all of them say I
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:38.600]  want my free goodies and I get you know all this welfare money that's why I'm
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:42.640]  gonna get angry well we're gonna find out what happens in the next 20 days it's
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:47.200]  one of the craziest election cycles I've ever seen Joe Curle thank you so much

[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:10.480]  raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for
[1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:14.120]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:18.040]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:21.160]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:24.040]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for

[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:36.840]  everyone knows where I stand thank you for joining us again another hour of
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:44.320]  global transmission against tyranny Mitt Romney supported abortion with that
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:51.600]  same clear-eyed charmingness that he shows today for 30 years running around
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:55.440]  supporting his father supporting his mother supporting other political
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:09:02.120]  campaigns I could play the clips all day and I really disrespect someone that
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:09.720]  passionately promotes abortion and then says they're totally against it okay I
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:16.640]  mean Romney is a really convincing person he's charming so is Obama but
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:21.240]  Romney's been anti-gun before Romney's been for open borders so when he's up
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.960]  there telling Obama I'll legalize the illegals I mean I guess the illegals
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:29.600]  should probably be voting for Romney he'll probably actually get it done you
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:35.760]  know the issue here is that I don't like Mitt Romney I don't like being conned and
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:39.160]  I don't like the devil even if he's trying to put his arm around me that's a
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:44.280]  quote a paraphrase from Albert Spear the people he became the head of the
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:49.080]  Department of the Interior in Germany an architect that Hitler really liked he's
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:51.640]  one of the few guys that didn't get convicted at Nuremberg because they
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:56.360]  could show he really wasn't connected to the really dark stuff but he apologized
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:02.000]  and said you don't know the devil's bad or is the devil when he's got a warm
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.360]  arm around your shoulder and you know Mitt Romney has a warm arm around our
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:11.080]  shoulders those of us that want second amendment family anti-abortion pro-life
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:18.600]  national sovereignty sounds good I mean he says a lot of good things that said
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:23.400]  though we know who Barack Obama is I mean he has been anti small business he
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:26.800]  said you didn't build your small business he said everything you can to shut
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.360]  down small businesses we know he pushes abortion worldwide including massively
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:35.440]  increasing funding for basically forced abortion where they make you have an
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.240]  abortion if you want government money in Africa a total open borders total
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:46.280]  federalization UN over our military it's so crazy when he brings up Bane
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:50.640]  capital too because Bane capital you can look this up is given more money a lot
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:54.400]  more last time I checked double the money to Obama then they've given to
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:58.720]  Mitt Romney and of course Mitt Romney should be criticized for some of his
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:03.360]  corporate is takeover stuff a lot of that's not free market it's looting but
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:08.800]  Obama is is funded by the very same people and his the point is when you're
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:14.200]  informed it's just all a wall of disinformation and fraud and I will not
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:18.800]  sit here and believe Mitt Romney who says he's changed because he doesn't say
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:24.120]  he's changed he just says he now supports all these things I agree with see if he
[1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:28.840]  came out and apologized and explained how he changed and swore he'd never go
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:38.760]  back on his word then then I would you know maybe go lesser two evils but
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:43.560]  still even if you don't like Romney you're left with Obama and I it is a
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:49.000]  Hobson's choice I guess they call it but that debate was rigged and was
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.400]  shameful and so it's like psychologically by the end I looked at my wife and I
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:56.880]  said I may go on the air and say vote for Romney tomorrow now I woke up in the
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:01.480]  morning and kind of cooler head prevailed it's still though I'm watching a
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:05.760]  rigged event and I'm just like this is rigged this is rigged and so
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:10.840]  psychologically I'm like well I'm for the underdog but again it's a distraction
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:14.720]  Romney Obama it's the globalist above them and this whole dog and pony show
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:18.360]  with them fighting and the rigging and all of it that's just management teams
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:22.960]  battling for the control so we need to get past that diversion and look at the
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:27.360]  private Federal Reserve the globalist the eugenicist and why no matter who we
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.760]  get in office at the highest levels the agenda just moves forward they
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:37.000]  implement the agenda in different ways with different styles but it's the same
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.840]  thing so that's what I have to say but clearly the Democrats are in power they
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:45.280]  want to continue what they're doing and they want to rule by executive decree
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:50.240]  and they've moved Homeland Security from focusing on LCI ADA over to the
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:56.120]  American people and that's now admitted so I'm in the position people have to
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:59.240]  understand this too and Joseph Farah made this point on air a few months ago
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:04.680]  but I already knew this point but he just articulated it and that's that hey
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:12.440]  Alex they see world net daily and they see in fall wars.com in the Republican
[1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:16.120]  Party camp regardless and that's why the Democratic Party operatives come after
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:22.440]  us and sick the IRS on us I just don't whine about it and and and you know the
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:26.920]  threats and the attacks and the legal harassment it's all this stuff constantly
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:31.840]  going on I don't even get into on the air because they want to shut us down so
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:36.160]  it's like okay you don't want to be in the Republican camp Mr. Jones fine how
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.000]  about you're in the no man's land where the wolves are going to come after you
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.400]  because Alex your pro gun your pro second amendment your pro family the
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:47.520]  Republican Party claims there for all of that even if they betray it so because
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:51.680]  you say you're for those things the Democrats hate your guts because they're
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:56.200]  proud of their communism they're proud of their anti-family they're proud of
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:00.160]  abortion they're proud of eugenics Bill Maher all of them they're always
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:04.840]  talking about you know kill people kill this kill that get rid of the elderly
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:08.600]  get rid of the on and on and on that's who they are they're bunch of nasty
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:14.240]  people and so regardless okay I'm not endorsing Romney I'm still gonna be
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:19.600]  attacked I'm still called a right-winger I'm not a right-winger I'm a classical
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:23.520]  liberal like Thomas Jefferson that's what I believe but people don't even know
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:28.720]  what real terms are anymore so I just sit here under attack because I don't
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:32.360]  want to turn my guns in and I think my property taxes are too high they even
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:38.960]  had a lulac in East Austin usually very liberal come out yesterday on the news
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:44.720]  and say we've polled the Hispanics in East Austin areas who are smart hard
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:49.880]  working industrious people Texas citizens American citizens and none of
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:54.240]  them want this property tax increase and they had guys on the local 5 9 a.m. was
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:57.520]  it you know have a newscast interview on them and they were at this public event
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:02.800]  with the state senator Kirk Watson it sold us out to the UN he was mayor here
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:06.680]  this is a microcosm of your area and the lulac heads like listen these big
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.880]  corporations all get tax exemptions and our people you know they can't pay these
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:16.280]  property taxes the average small little home in East Austin has a $2,000 a year
[1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:26.160]  tax yeah I had a hundred thousand dollar house years ago that I sold and my last
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:31.400]  property tax bill this is like seven years ago eight years ago my last
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:34.600]  property tax bill in that hundred hundred ten thousand dollar house what it
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:46.480]  cost very modest house three bedroom house but small that house I was paying
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:52.040]  something like $2,200 in property taxes rent on my property but I'm now
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:55.520]  digressing I said I'd get into the debate and play clips of it and give the
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:00.440]  number out so you can join us on air if you want to talk about the debate if
[1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:03.720]  if you thought it was rage or think I'm wrong think it was you know the greatest
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.000]  thing since sliced bread her interrupting Romney 28 times to nine times for
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:14.600]  Obama Obama getting nine plus percent more time the moderator lying and saying
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:18.520]  that Obama you know was correct butting in with it I mean it was just off the
[1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:22.640]  charts and I mean even if you don't like Mitt Romney did just what you like
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:26.320]  totally rigged garbage and I know the whole things of diversion but the fact
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:32.480]  that they can be that staged shows how stupid they think we are eight hundred
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:36.880]  two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:41.480]  thirty one first-time callers me add that proviso you have first-time callers
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:45.240]  a chance to get involved on air and we'll play some of these clips and get to
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:50.720]  it I've also got the anti-gun stuff that that's what really creep me out I mean
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:54.200]  Romney you know Obama's like yeah we're coming after your semi-autos I want to
[1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:57.440]  ban those and yeah I want to be able to give you a psychological designation or
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:16:59.840]  I just take your guns that's what he basically said and that's their agenda
[1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:04.760]  and then Romney's like hey I was for a semi-auto band but we the hunters got
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:09.560]  some of what they wanted but we were friends he's like hey you know I gave
[1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:14.480]  you painkillers for I knocked your teeth out you know oh I I acted friendly I can
[1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:18.400]  get things done I can get everybody legalized that you know and and all this
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:23.320]  stuff it's just like oh man I mean it's bad I mean when the so-called
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:30.080]  conservative Republican constitutionalist is what Bill Clinton was
[1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:35.920]  basically it's that's how they move us with the overton window where the
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:40.080]  with the so-called liberals are authoritarian crazy anti-human nut
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:45.760]  cases with a bunch of moron domesticated people following them and then
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:49.040]  you've got the Republicans that basically are like socialist I mean it's
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:54.040]  just like wow they have really taken over by controlling the choices we've got
[1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:57.880]  I'm gonna go out to break as I tried to play this last hour and didn't go to it
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:02.520]  on time my fault we'll come back and start getting into debate clips but here
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.400]  is Susan Rice the US ambassador of the UN she was on Face the Nation all the
[1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:11.280]  shows and the days after the September 11th Benghazi attack that whoever stage
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:15.920]  it false flag or whatever and had a lot of evidence of that it was a terror
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:19.760]  attack it was a coordinated attack and she said it wasn't and they said it for
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:24.920]  they argue 10 days they put a proviso in 10 days later quietly started saying it
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.160]  was a coordinated attack an organized attack a premeditated attack not a
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.120]  protest that did this that killed the Navy Seals and the rest of it let's go
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:35.520]  to that club and try to get it aired here as we go to break here it is
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:39.600]  Madam Ambassador he says this is something's been in the planning stages
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:43.320]  for months I understand you have been saying that you think it was
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:47.520]  spontaneous are we not on the same page here well Bob let me tell you what we
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:52.280]  understand to be the assessment at present first of all very importantly as
[1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:55.760]  you discussed with the president there is a investigation that the United States
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:01.040]  government will launch led by the FBI that has begun and they're not on the
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:04.800]  ground yet but they have already begun looking at all sorts of evidence of
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:09.160]  various sorts already available to them and to us and they will get on the
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:13.080]  ground and continue the investigation so we'll want to see the results of that
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:17.320]  investigation to draw any definitive conclusions but based on the best
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:22.520]  information we have to date what our assessment is as of the present is in
[1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:29.280]  fact what it began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what it
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:34.200]  transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where of course as you know there was a
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:40.840]  violent protest outside of our embassy sparked by this hateful video but soon
[1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:46.920]  after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:52.920]  we believe that it looks like extremist elements individuals joined in that
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:59.560]  effort and it just goes on and on but then candy correct though excuse me
[1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:03.960]  candy Crowley Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the
[1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:08.000]  Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.560]  homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[1:20:11.560 --> 1:20:15.400]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:19.080]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:22.280]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[1:20:22.280 --> 1:20:25.520]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:29.680]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:34.200]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:37.800]  a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans
[1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:41.200]  can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally
[1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:44.640]  and privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as

[1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:41.240]  full wars.com and prisonplanet.com I got a lot of other world news and things we
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:45.680]  will be getting to that are very very important also there's a list out what
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:49.960]  were the historians put together and the one independent of the richest people in
[1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:53.200]  history I think that's going to be informative I'm going to go over that
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:58.200]  I've also got some special reports that we're going to premiere here including
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:02.520]  Jacari Jackson's review of Black Ops 2 video game review why do we do that
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:06.120]  because it's laced with propaganda most people don't get their news from the
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:09.720]  news they just sit there and are bombarded through entertainment so
[1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:15.320]  that's coming up you know I've got like I don't know five or six of these clips
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:18.680]  and we'll play more of it coming up in the next hour I don't know where to
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:24.000]  start I mean it's all just so ridiculous what's scary is the anti-gun stuff and
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.680]  that's coming up in the next hour we're going to play that exchange where
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:31.840]  Obama says he wants to ban your semi-autos and Mitt Romney defends his
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:36.800]  record of supporting an assault weapons ban it just it just goes from bad to
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:42.680]  worse and it really is out of control to have the Republican candidate have such
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:48.240]  an anti-gun history but the issue is could he get away with pushing anti-gun
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:52.920]  as a Republican probably not that's the real clincher for me last night when I
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:56.120]  looked at my wife and said should I get behind Romney I mean there's election
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:26:00.560]  fraud anyways because if I don't stand up against Obama he'll probably ban guns
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:04.440]  and then I'll wish later I'd have done something I mean I am just totally I'm
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:09.920]  not I'm not normally indecisive and I am just absolutely
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:15.120]  polaxed here because I know Romney's bad but I know Obama's worse but it's this
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:18.600]  lesser of two evils that's gotten us here and I'm the guy that's always been
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.080]  against lesser of two evil garbage we need we need to demand something real
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:28.240]  and and move things back towards liberty not let them move things towards
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:33.720]  tyranny let's play part of this clip and I'll be talking over it here's the
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:37.400]  question and the guy that asked the question thinks it's you know real smart
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:42.320]  to be able to ask a question so they had a think tank brain trust come up with
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:46.960]  this question and all the obsession over the ambassador and security and our
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:51.720]  people and acting like they care this is Hillary that laughs about people she's
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:56.760]  killed like Gaddafi and others and I came I saw he died they talk about an
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:01.800]  Iran war her and Baker and start laughing on the stage you don't laugh about war
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:06.160]  even if you're a warmonger it's disgusting it's like going to a funeral home
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:09.760]  and there's a dead body at up front and you walk up to a family and laugh at them
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.280]  it's sick it's it's decadent it's disconnected from reality like
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:19.280]  Strauss-Kahn and devil worship orgies now in the news these people are nuts
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:24.120]  they're a bunch of decadent scum I'm sorry I'm ranting let's go to the clip here
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:29.480]  it is I'm sorry what's your name it's Kerry Kerry Latke carry this question
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:34.880]  actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at global telecom supply and
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:39.560]  Minniola yesterday nice plug around talking about Libya and we were reading
[1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:45.120]  and became aware of reports that the State Department refused extra security
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:51.680]  for embassy in Benghazi Libya prior to the attacks that killed four Americans
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:58.440]  who was it that denied enhanced security and why well let me first of all talk
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:04.400]  about our diplomats because they serve all around the world and do an
[1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:11.720]  incredible job in a very dangerous turn him off just for a minute you know we
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:14.600]  don't know what really happened there we don't know the news story of the Navy
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:19.520]  Seals down the road in another mission the former Navy Seals that means CIA in
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:23.320]  a mission above Navy Seals that's just a recruiting ground at that level so is
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:29.080]  Delta Force a lot of stuff above that as I've told you and they're sitting there I
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:34.760]  know because I'm not gonna get into it the point is they're sitting there and
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:40.040]  then they run and then have this big shootout trying to help the embassy
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:44.320]  substation the consulate or whatever you want to call it we don't know if any of
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:48.960]  that's true we've gotten like five six stories three of them in one day a few
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:52.400]  weeks ago I mean who knows if any of this is true and who knows that people
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:57.760]  are right that it was a neo-con false flag you know now Obama says he's
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:01.680]  gonna have drones and a strike force take out Al Qaeda how do we know they
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:05.240]  didn't have some of their boys they brought in there over a year ago in
[1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:10.400]  Benghazi the Al Qaeda headquarters for NATO Sarkozy and Obama and how do we
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:15.040]  know they didn't sacrifice him with the plan to later go take out that Al Qaeda
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:19.920]  to say oh look he didn't just take out bin Laden he took out Al Qaeda yeah Al
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:24.640]  Qaeda you ordered to go do it how do we know that's not what went on that's my
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:30.400]  point all I know is the globalist run Al Qaeda and I don't need some curves
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:35.240]  trying to grab my genitals so I can fly places I only fly places that I
[1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:40.240]  absolutely have to my children I got a 10 year old son he's never flown you know
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:46.440]  why because I can't let some fat guy grab on him I will not do it and I'm

[1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:28.320]  all right I'll play more of the clips of this debate and the anti-gun stuff
[1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:31.920]  that's the biggest news out there really coming up in the next hour I want to
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:37.040]  start getting to your phone calls Peter, Mark, James, Frankie, Frank and many others
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:41.440]  that are patiently holding today to get on air to give us your take on what
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:45.640]  happened in the debate last night again we know it's a dog and pony show but the
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.600]  way they can stage it now the way they can skew it and cheat and give Obama
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:55.200]  more time and interrupt and have the moderator agreeing with Obama
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:34:00.440]  authoritatively when it's a lie it's just off the charts the fact that we've
[1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:04.760]  gotten to that level and it's just such deception now people just tune out and
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:09.960]  say oh whatever must be true 60 million heard it and the media is debating who
[1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:14.760]  was right now when it's clear Romney was right I mean even if you don't like Romney
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:19.760]  you've got to admit it's a fraud and they're trying to throw this that's
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:24.000]  because internal polling shows I've talked a lot of big journalists about
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.400]  this who were seen internal polling shows Obama's been behind for months and
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:32.640]  now you see in polls Romney going ahead he's really winning but you see they're
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:36.440]  gonna say he's losing so people go well I better get on the bandwagon and vote
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:40.120]  for a winner because a lot of people just vote for it's like the sports team
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:46.120]  scenario the bandwagon scenario where as soon as a team it gets in the playoffs
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.440]  everybody goes and buys their t-shirts they don't root for the team they've
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  loved or where they grew up or that you know that's their team they just pick
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:58.360]  who they think the winner is and we see this with the Republicans as well just
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.600]  as long as somebody's a Republican well they must be okay then even though
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:06.840]  they're anti-gun or anti you know sovereignty or pro you know globalist
[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:12.120]  patriot act all of it so I'm gonna get to that after we take some of your calls
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:15.920]  but again the big news as Joe Curle from the Washington Times talked about
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:20.400]  earlier I was talking to him he said oh yeah twitchy.com all these other big
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:24.000]  sites they're reporting on what you're reporting on as well but because they're
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:28.360]  not really political the George Soros crowd isn't attacking them they see me
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:31.960]  as political so they think they can attack me so that people then think that
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:38.920]  I'm doing this for political reasons no it's news when Mitt Romney is receiving
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:41.960]  thousands of death threats a day with people saying that they are going to go
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:47.000]  find him and kill him I mean it's specific and I've had secret service
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.760]  asked me what I think of Obama and everybody knows I am not offensively
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:56.240]  violent you attack me you're gonna get attacked in big time but I'm not I'm
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:03.320]  trying to stop civil war I'm trying to stop violence believe me I'm not stupid
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:06.520]  enough to think it's gonna be fun once all this kicks off
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:11.600]  discretion is the greater part of valor and it's not because I'm afraid I know
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:16.160]  a little bit of history I've seen a few things and I understand rhetoric's one
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:22.240]  thing reality is another and I am offended I was talking to man Cal Eric
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:25.360]  Mueller on his syndicated show a lot of the same stations pick up his show to
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:30.640]  pick up mine and he was showing oh yeah he's been visited by the secret service
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:36.520]  as well over mild statements before like this world would would would be a
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:41.600]  better place you know without Bill Clinton you know in it and they came
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:44.640]  and visited him and that was I think a second time wouldn't the first time
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:49.360]  Bill Clinton was just coming to town and they said you will not cover Bill
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:54.000]  Clinton you will not talk about Bill Clinton or you're off the air and you
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.440]  know what he kept his mouth shut but he talked about it later because he knew
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:02.960]  they could go to his employers folks the secret service I know somebody who who
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.440]  has a family friend they work the same place that got fired because he made
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:11.720]  mild statements about Obama and somebody went entitled on him and they came and
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:15.320]  said we can't arrest you for what you said but you're ordered to fire him and
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:20.320]  the car dealership fired the guy who'd been there for many years and said get
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:24.680]  your stuff and get out so you know what I'm sick of this I'm sick and tired of
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:28.760]  it okay I don't like the secret service coming here and snooping around I don't
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:33.440]  like the FBI asking me about my film the Obama deception three days before it was
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:37.600]  released so we released it early and then calling my crew members and asking
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:42.160]  so tell me about this film I mean the White House was worried about this film
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:47.480]  they're creepy they're in my life and I don't like it and then I got to have
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:52.680]  George Soros's publications saying I'm racist and bad and race baiting because
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:56.120]  you got a bunch of people that happen to be black saying they're gonna riot if
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:01.240]  Obama doesn't get reelected when we've had riots in this country before and
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:05.720]  there's riots all over the world about elections I mean here's here's here's the
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:11.120]  article threats to assassinate Romney explode after debate top story info wars
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:17.920]  dot com prison planet dot com here's another one family changes controversial
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:21.360]  Halloween display yeah I've got articles where people to put chairs in their
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:24.920]  front yards they're getting their windows knocked out this is out of
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:31.240]  Colleyville where is Colleyville this is CBS news story I read it this morning but
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:35.000]  I went to look up where Colleyville is these local stories torture me because
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.520]  I never tell where they're at where is Colleyville it goes on CBS 11 Vandals
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:43.960]  destroyed a Halloween display in Colleyville that had drawn criticism for
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:49.320]  the way it mixed the holiday with the race for the winehouse less than two
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:51.960]  days after it was destroyed though dozens of people volunteered to rebuild it
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:39:01.360]  with a new message and it was Biden as a clown in a spider web along with
[1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:08.200]  Obama it makes me want to go put this on my house I'm serious because if you
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:12.760]  don't exercise the first amendment you lose it now where is Colleyville it
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:16.040]  didn't matter I'm just one of you might know I'm driving me crazy when these
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:22.440]  local news stories never say where it is outside Fort Worth okay yeah oh yeah I
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:25.480]  grew up in Dallas I should have known that there's so many towns there and I
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:31.200]  knew it sounded familiar so this is in Texas you can't put up a funny display
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:35.280]  but let me tell you the Secret Service went out and visited some guy in Austin
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:39.440]  had a chair in his front yard and people kept running off with the chair so he
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:43.080]  tied it down and they said that's a rope that means you want to hang old Obama
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:47.880]  well let's say maybe that's what it vaguely meant it obviously wasn't a real
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:51.800]  threat but people are on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube we found videos now
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:55.400]  saying they're gonna kill Mitt Romney they're gonna shove a gun in his mouth
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:40:00.400]  and spray bullets they're gonna burn stuff down and it's like how dare you Alex
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:10.840]  Jones even cover that you filth look at this Twitter may face legal action over
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:14.880]  anti-Semitic tweets France 24 international news reporting that and
[1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:19.520]  again France has tried to shut down Yahoo before and my issue here is we'll go
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:24.280]  under EU globalist rules if you don't allow racist and offensive speech you
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:27.800]  lose it all and that's why they're trying to get us in line globally to
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:32.160]  restrict our speech here is because if you don't let people draw the Prophet
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:36.360]  Muhammad with a bomb on his head if you don't let people you know say they don't
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:39.440]  like Jews or whatever then you're gonna lose your free speech and it's all
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:44.720]  gonna be selectively enforced and now France is trying to change our web
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:49.560]  laws and rules with lawsuits against companies and people the government of
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:54.040]  France that reminds me of Bloomberg trying to sue gun manufacturers all over
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:58.160]  the country because he bans guns in the city or it's been banned makes it a
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:03.880]  happy hunting ground for criminals so that's some of what's coming up I'm

[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:34.880]  getting the word out as well that's part of the money bomb is support name give
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:39.200]  a donation to your local station even of the you know local talk station that's
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:42.800]  what that's what it is to support freedom even if you don't think you know
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:48.400]  go tell her an advertising package even if it's small that is a way to donate
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:54.760]  okay let's go to Peter in Switzerland listening via info wars calm Peter thank
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:57.840]  you for holding on been ranting did you watch the debate or what are you calling
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:02.680]  about today well Alex I have to make an observation you've been telling us for
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:08.440]  years that the left-right paradigm is false you've been telling us for years
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:12.720]  that there's no difference between the Republicans and the Democrats yet you
[1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:19.280]  wasted 90 minutes of this this program to do what he said she said on this
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:25.480]  debate I think you should have just ignored it completely now I hear you
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:32.040]  but I I've admitted that that that's I'm always so decisive I'm being honest
[1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:37.280]  though my honesty is all I've got because I can't I mean look how fast I get up to
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:40.480]  the news and the info I'm not calculating all this out I'm telling you
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:47.720]  what's in my heart I wear it on my sleeve and it's not like it's stage in
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:51.480]  there in a back room going hey let's do this I think there have been some
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:54.440]  presidential elections like that Kerry and Bush to a certain extent I think
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:00.120]  Kerry laid down and I pointed that out it's just that within the facet it was
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:06.840]  completely rigged and so my question is why do they not want Romney in there I
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:11.400]  mean why is Bane Capital giving more money to Obama than Mitt Romney I'm
[1:48:11.400 --> 1:48:16.360]  asking that question I'm saying I'm saying is Obama so bad and listen I'm
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:19.880]  not gonna vote so you know whatever happens I'm just saying we're in trouble
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:23.760]  here I mean I'm just kind of thinking a loud I don't think we wasted time I
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:28.040]  think it's important to explain to people that you know that's not what you
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:32.320]  call a real debate I mean that's how bad our presidential system's gotten go
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:37.040]  ahead yeah I think but I think it's irrelevant to analyze what took place
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:42.720]  because what it sounds like is that you're backhandingly endorsing Mitt
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:46.520]  Romney well no no I didn't do it backhanded I'm admitting that it that
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:50.480]  it's backhanded I mean I said that I'm being completely honest you heard me say
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:55.120]  I looked at my wife and I said my gosh Obama just said he's gonna come for our
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:01.680]  guns and and Romney says he won't I mean I'm like whoa is it immoral to just sit
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:05.560]  here and say they're both the same because yes the left-right paradigm is
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:09.160]  how they manipulate us when the left and right and so things never change I get
[1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:14.520]  that but within the left-right paradigm within the box it's a very complex
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:21.400]  philosophical and geopolitical and question so you're on the air you
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:24.440]  weren't screened when you came on I appreciate your question what do you
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:28.440]  think we should be covering I did cover Israel saying they may strike Syria this
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:32.520]  is this is serious I think the interesting thing about the Rothschild
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:37.760]  family is much more interesting than this dog-and-pony show as you refer to it
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.960]  why not talk about that I am going to get to it I think I did talk about that
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:44.800]  I've talked about a bunch of other stuff and tied it into you know when I
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:48.280]  started talking about the debate in Al Qaeda and the Benghazi attack I did a
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:52.880]  whole you know 20 minute breakdown or so about Al Qaeda being run by the by the
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:56.920]  West I mean I beat that to death I mean I didn't really just cover the debate in
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:00.920]  the last hour and a half my friend but but I do get your criticisms and I was
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:07.240]  criticizing myself I I rarely I mean I never am indecisive I'm too decisive
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:11.840]  sometimes and I am just absolutely floored right now and I'm being honest
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:16.960]  with you so I mean what do I do I guess just that's what my gut says just
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:20.880]  whatever happens it's going to be horrible and so don't endorse either one
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:25.040]  and just keep exposing the New World Order I said that earlier just expose
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:28.880]  that you know the actual puppet masters not the puppets I mean I mean do you
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:32.880]  think that's the course to take I absolutely think that's the course to
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:38.400]  take and I think anything else is a waste of your precious energy hey what are
[1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:43.720]  you doing in Switzerland are you from Switzerland I'm in a naturalized Swiss
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:48.760]  citizen do you like it over there sure do I hear it's awesome I've never been

[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:13.680]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:18.600]  the caller is right at an academic level that's what the whole left-right thing
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:21.880]  is with the globalist control both parties I was just talking about that
[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:27.040]  and then the so-called left leads us closer to tyranny and then when the
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:31.680]  right gets in they lead us closer to tyranny and it's becoming more and
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:40.160]  more clear my only issue is we're 20 days away from this election and I haven't
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:43.680]  even gotten to this yet I mean that it is big news that Obama said yeah he wants
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:47.920]  to ban semi-autos that's what he's proposing in his second term he won't
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:51.560]  be facing a reelection he has executive orders Congress wouldn't do the
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:56.280]  cybersecurity takeover he says he's signing an executive order so we need
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:04.240]  to really think this out that's all I'm saying because the United States is the
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:09.120]  is basically the engine of the new world order right now let's go to James and
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:15.280]  Illinois listing on XM 166 XM radio then we'll go to Frankie on 880 and have
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:20.360]  another caller listening on FM but go ahead you're on the air James yeah I've
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:24.880]  got three points I want to make with you and then have you pick them apart if you
[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:32.360]  will last night debate did you notice in the gun discussion that Mitt Romney
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:37.280]  made their mention of fast and furious and candy Crowley jumped in and said I
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:43.120]  think I heard her say specifically fast and furious had nothing to do with guns
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:47.920]  yes in fact that's the exchange I have that I meant to get to this hour but
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:51.600]  I'm so long-winded I haven't played it yet I've got that whole clip that I will
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:54.960]  play you guys have got to make me play that let's say bottom of the hour next
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:56:00.480]  hour I'll do it and analyze it because it was bad and that's when I looked at my
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:04.320]  wife that was near the end of the debate and I said I said less or two evils
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:08.160]  yeah but at least he brought up fast and furious and he's not gonna be able to
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:12.320]  go after our guns as a Republican it just doesn't fly and I said wow if we
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:17.120]  stay out of this Obama may actually send cops to take our guns and I was I'm
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:21.400]  just and I'm and I'm like I guess we just say bring it on or do we try to go
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:26.280]  with the lesser of evils and and my wife you know who's not Republican or
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:31.560]  Democrat she's a constitutionalist she just she was dumbfounded too but I mean
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:36.280]  obviously she saw they were rigging it against she hasn't liked Mitt Romney she
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:39.880]  said he's like a charming vampire but she was hating on Obama by the end just
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:44.320]  because it was so rigged I just I'm being sucked into it all because it is
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:49.160]  fake it is a fraud but it'll tear your arm off you know like like we're in this
[1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:55.560]  paradigm we're in this matrix I know it's a matrix but if we totally divorce
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:57:00.840]  ourselves from it then we have no power because the public so dumb down they
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:05.080]  give the power to it doesn't matter if we're awake because they they aren't
[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:12.120]  awake so the answer is wake them up I guess it's just I just am so disgusted
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:17.600]  by how openly evil the agenda is of Obama go ahead sir well just summed up
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:21.720]  point that you just made about the public being dumbed down and us being
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:28.400]  awake I think this comment by Obama that was made about the dollar 86 a gallon
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:34.400]  of gas where he said that the reason that it was that low when he got an
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:41.080]  office was because we were in a recession so therefore in his words a
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:45.280]  better economy means more expensive gas yeah they're gonna start selling the
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:51.520]  idea of hyperinflation being good anybody with basic economic knowledge
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:57.600]  basic math knowledge who knows if the laws of supply and demand the board that
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:04.120]  you have a something lower prices are so people buy more I mean that's basic
[1:58:04.120 --> 1:58:07.920]  economic knowledge no army knows all about that no no you're absolutely right
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:12.400]  yeah yeah and by the way Obama has offshore accounts too I mean again you're
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:16.080]  absolutely right what was your other point okay the first thing I have that
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:20.240]  this is a question I have because I see it on Facebook and everywhere everybody
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:26.200]  keeps debating that a vote for Ron Paul who I personally voted for is a vote for
[1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:31.720]  Obama now my question on this is if Ron Paul was in the Republican Party hold
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:35.040]  on I want to hear this question but regardless of where you stand on it a
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:40.440]  vote for Ron Paul is a vote for Barack Obama at this point

[2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:28.960]  yeah I'm the guy that preaches lesser of two evils is what's gotten us here by
[2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:33.360]  allowing these candidates to always be globalist just a right-winger left-wing
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:40.160]  version my issue is Obama is so bad and it's moving so quick is that because the
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:44.920]  globalists are in high gear or is it because Obama has such a group of
[2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:48.320]  radicals around him who are implementing the globalist agenda in a very
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:54.600]  communist way and would Mitt Romney be worse that's why I can't say vote for
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:01:00.320]  Mitt Romney because I just I know he's I know he's a liar I know he's lied and
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:06.080]  flip-flopped so I'm not gonna be conned I get all that I'm just saying at an
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:12.680]  intellectual level I'm freaked out by Barack Obama and the people that are
[2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:18.280]  behind him I mean and I didn't like Herman Cain either you know I would vote
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:24.520]  for a black guy who was pro-liberty in zero seconds instantly and again the
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:27.880]  media says well if you don't vote for Obama you're racist I'm just so tired of
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:32.080]  it I just want freedom and let me tell you what Obama's pushing is not freedom
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:38.280]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts got an article out today called rest in peace USA I put
[2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:42.880]  in full wars.com and he goes over the death panels that are in there I mean
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:47.640]  there really are death panels by another name but a rose is still a rose by any
[2:01:47.640 --> 2:01:52.080]  other name William Shakespeare a death panel still a death panel by any other
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:58.120]  name and I you know just horrible and Mitt Romney quote wrote Obamacare no he
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:01.280]  didn't that's what the insurance companies wrote and he got it in
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:06.080]  Massachusetts and so they went to Obama and said do this that's how much
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:09.680]  trouble we're in because these guys are puppets and you're gonna get a globalist
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:13.360]  agenda so yes I get there both bad that's why I don't support either one of
[2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:18.840]  them it's just that I've had the Secret Service and FBI visit me when I
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:23.600]  criticize Obama and then now they can sit there and say kill Mitt Romney and
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:29.200]  nobody gets in trouble there's a double standard and I've been thrown in with the
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:33.200]  Republicans regardless by the George Soros crowd who attacks me constantly
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:37.880]  and the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center do people get that you like if
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:42.480]  drones were flying around from Russia and you know we're dropping bombs on me
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:48.320]  it's like they're targeting me they see me as their enemy because I am pro gun
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:52.720]  pro liberty pro family so because the Republicans act like they're for that I've
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:58.280]  been put in that camp and can anyone understand that that's the issue I've
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:02.360]  been put in the camp with the Republicans because I've supported Ron Paul and
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:07.960]  others so I'm here being attacked even though I'm not with the Republicans so
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:13.080]  I'm out here in the open being attacked by a giant political machine I'm sorry
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:18.840]  I'm ranting so get to your Ron Paul point yes the debate technically almost
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:22.840]  everyone that's going to vote for Ron Paul would be a Republican usually so
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:27.960]  yes people writing in Ron Paul will basically could be the deciding factor
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:35.360]  of putting putting Obama into office and part of me says good bring it on let's
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:41.040]  really see what communism and globalism is does that answer your question sir not
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:46.000]  really because if Ron Paul was a Republican when he was on the ballot
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.880]  why wouldn't those votes count as Republican based and go to Mitt Romney
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:55.520]  why would they go to Obama they're totally against the Democrats no no no no
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:00.720]  I'm not a good communicator I thought you were saying writing in if you write in
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:08.480]  Ron Paul and don't vote for for for one of the candidates then generally you know
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:13.640]  I agree with you most Ron Paul voters would be a Republican and so if they'd
[2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:19.960]  write in Ron Paul that's a vote for Obama because it's a wasted Republican vote
[2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:26.920]  because that doesn't make sense that's what I'm saying as a Republican it should go to a Republican why is it a wasted vote we're
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:30.840]  supporting a Republican because you have to because it has to be a name on the
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:38.000]  ballot it still doesn't make sense that's that's why I don't get everybody's
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:43.480]  going up and on about a vote for a long pause a vote for Obama and the vote will just be
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:48.040]  thrown out because he's not officially on the ballot you only get one vote
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:53.240]  unless you're a Democrat you understand that if you're if you're not a
[2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:57.280]  Democrat against a vote five or six times only a Democrat could vote for Ron
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:03.080]  Paul and still vote for Obama Aaron Fulham here as the food police shut down
[2:05:03.080 --> 2:05:07.640]  food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a
[2:05:07.640 --> 2:05:10.880]  raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for
[2:05:10.880 --> 2:05:14.560]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on

[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:32.600]  welcome ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us I'm your host alex jones
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:40.280]  and it is Wednesday the 17th day of October 2012 we're continuing here in
[2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:45.560]  the shower with your phone calls giving us your take on the debate last night
[2:08:45.560 --> 2:08:51.480]  and just the fact that it was rigged in every way the questions that Alistair
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:57.760]  Crowley was asking excuse me what's that ladies name the singing in which I'm
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:03.800]  sorry I'm being mean candy Alistair Crowley I thought for a minute she was
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:12.600]  Mr. Maddow I mean Rachel Maddow or what's his name Raymond Maddow hardball
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:19.720]  hard slime okay I'm I'm I'm absolute I'm absolutely out of control here it
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:26.800]  it made me sick I don't like rigged things and that's why I don't watch you
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:33.080]  professional heavyweight boxing matches and I like real things and that was
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:38.440]  disgusting I mean you've got the flip-flopping fraud Romney and then it
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:43.640]  just gets worse from there you've got Obama and CNN and the rigging and the
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:48.040]  erasing history and saying they never said it wasn't a terror attack the
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:52.600]  Benghazi killing of the ambassador and then and then they just heaped layer
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:57.920]  after layer they were gaming things so much and things were so scripted it was
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:04.800]  a bunch of fits and starts and halting just ugly and you heard a caller earlier
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:08.720]  if you just you know tuned in the last 20 minutes or so he said Alice we don't
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:13.440]  want to hear about this is a diversion it's a distraction and I hear you but
[2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:19.040]  we're still in the middle of this and my point is this is what the reality show
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:23.680]  has become the political reality show has become quite a joke I'm gonna go back
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:26.800]  to your calls and then I will get into that article I mentioned about the
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:30.160]  richest man in the world the richest man in history has been announced and the
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:34.240]  Rothschilds are right underneath him so we're gonna be breaking that down as I
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:38.240]  promised at the bottom of the hour briefly here if you're radio listeners go
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:42.400]  up to info wars.com you can see some of the cool time-lapse videos the crew
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:48.160]  did you're watching us right now at info wars news.com or prison planet dot
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:53.440]  TV we're gonna roll one of the little time lapses of the ACL Fest they had
[2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:57.400]  here in Austin Texas this weekend big rock concert and we had the crew go out
[2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:02.760]  and put out close to a thousand of some of the magazines we're getting close to
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:07.920]  running out now the October issue and we were putting them on the streets so
[2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:16.080]  again here's that time-lapse and you can order these these are a message in the
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:26.680]  bottle that's why these magazines are so incredibly important is that they are
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:31.920]  messages in a bottle about information people never gotten from the control left
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:37.920]  the control right covering the global crime syndicate covering their police
[2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:45.360]  state takeover program it is all there in the magazine our second issue has
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:55.240]  come out you can get a subscription with the shipping included and you can give
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:12:01.360]  these out to friends and family you can also buy them in bulk you can buy what
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:06.000]  10 of them for 14 95 and it gets even more discounted when you get a hundred
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:10.280]  of them and that is at our cost we've now come out with a second issue in
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:16.000]  glossy and it covers the technocracy the NSA spying the police state it's got a
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:24.240]  big color giant poster inside of it in the center spread great to hang up in
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:30.320]  legal and lawful areas in your town to awaken people will humanity survive the
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:34.880]  singularity it's just absolutely jam-packed and the next issue is
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:38.480]  gonna be even more powerful so support the broadcast but more importantly get
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:48.200]  the word out today and give these to people so many people ignore internet
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:52.040]  links or internet videos now because they're such a wash of them but if you
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:58.480]  will simply go out and give friends and family and others these magazines they
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:02.600]  are unlike any magazine you've ever read and again I liken them to messages in a
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:06.440]  bottle that's why I put 50,000 out in the streets of where I live Austin Texas
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:11.120]  and then keep another 50,000 for you listeners and we have now it's over 70
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:15.160]  different franchise groups that have contacted us when we go into phase two
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:19.160]  soon of having it printed with local news and it but also our national and
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:24.680]  international coverage in your area everywhere from Europe to Australia from
[2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:29.840]  the Middle East to Africa to Latin America to Canada all over people are
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:33.200]  planning on putting out their own version of inforce magazine so it's just
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:36.680]  in its embryonic form right now and I want to thank everybody for supporting
[2:13:36.680 --> 2:13:42.680]  it because in month to it has broken even and and my goal is to build it
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:45.680]  where it breaks even so I can reach the maximum number of people and keep them
[2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:52.480]  inexpensive but the goal of the franchise is to make it profitable and we can
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:58.440]  punch a button now and make it profitable right away so that's what we're
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:01.960]  developing and demonstrating so please take advantage of it at
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:07.320]  inforstore.com or 888-253-3139 it is so important to get
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:12.080]  inforce magazine read it and then give it to others or buy it at cost in bulk or
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:16.320]  do one one order and get 13 issues delivered to your home because we're
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:19.960]  going to give you the first issue we save some back along with the next 12

[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:41.360]  ahead and talk to Mark in Ohio then we'll go to Frankie listening on 880 and
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:44.280]  others Mark thanks for holding her on the air
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:49.840]  well this is such a pleasure to be on your show thank you very much I'm in the
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:54.680]  epicenter of all this nonsense I'm in Toledo Ohio and they have a big red X
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:15:00.760]  Romney and Obama they visit here non-stop about 45 minutes from Detroit where
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:04.920]  they hang all the signs you can't go in at your own risk and I'm about two hours
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:10.360]  from Chicago so we're in the middle of all this nonsense I absolutely discussed
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:17.200]  it from last night's display of what happened it was our president got caught
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:22.840]  in a flat-out lie on stage live and they're going back and saying he won
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:26.960]  the whole thing yeah that's how fraud works and again that's why I'm
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:33.320]  covering it the level of dissembling deception manipulation has reached just
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:40.320]  cartoon level in every way I mean how much more crazy can it get on top of
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:46.200]  it the al-Qaeda they say killed this guy was put in there by Obama by the
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:53.200]  globalist by NATO that's not even being discussed he's completely avoided the
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:57.120]  whole thing along with the one round he brought up the whole gun situation
[2:15:57.120 --> 2:16:01.000]  everything Obama still want to keep talking about education for the kids
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:05.360]  and I'm sitting there thinking whoa whoa wait a minute he completely railroaded
[2:16:05.360 --> 2:16:10.760]  it went off on some other tangent talking about and Alistair Crowley Alistair
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:15.400]  Crowley and drag all you know the moderator also that's what she looks
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:18.480]  like literally we ought to do a side-by-side Alistair Crowley with a
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:23.960]  black wig on I asked the graphics folks to do that next to Candy Crowley I'm not
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:27.400]  knocking folks the last name Crowley but come on I mean I mean she acts like
[2:16:27.400 --> 2:16:32.240]  Alistair Crowley but I just like having fun with this the point is is that it's
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:38.360]  disgusting I get angry at people that that try to engage in chicanery and
[2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:42.920]  manipulation of our electoral process but again it's frauds within scams within
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:49.120]  lies within deceptions but I am glad Romney brought up Fast and Furious that
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:54.080]  was one of the few good things he did but wasn't it creepy I'm gonna play it
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:58.360]  later when he was defending his assault weapons ban business in Massachusetts
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:02.280]  yeah absolutely have you heard anything about Jill Stein being arrested last
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:08.720]  night from the Green Party yes I have that in my stack that always happens
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:13.280]  they're always arresting people they remember they arrested Alan Keyes one
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:18.200]  time and they've arrested anybody that tries to show up who should be in there
[2:17:18.200 --> 2:17:22.560]  you know Green Party gets about 1% of the vote but I really think the
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.480]  libertarians should be in there I mean that's a it's a real party and if they
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:29.680]  ever got in there they know most Americans and polls actually call
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:32.640]  themselves libertarians did you know I've seen a bunch of big polls last year
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:36.760]  you can look these up yourself that libertarians are now the majority people
[2:17:36.760 --> 2:17:41.080]  will vote Democrat or Republican but they call themselves libertarians if you
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:45.160]  give somebody the real libertarian spiel there's almost no one out there who
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:49.160]  won't agree with it plus it really works I appreciate your call great points
[2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:54.880]  let's talk to Frankie in Arkansas listening on the big 880 a.m. k l r g
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:18:00.000]  you're on the air Frankie hi Alex thank you so much for taking my call I'm a
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:08.520]  first-time caller and yes I did listen to the debate last night and I thought
[2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:13.920]  they played patty cake a whole lot and me it looked like he had swallowed the
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:20.520]  helium gas and Obama looked at a seedy smile and a beady hawked eye and I
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:27.040]  thought it was staged and I thought candy was a bit biased but with the truth
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.880]  and I don't think either one of them are actually really capable of I think
[2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:36.520]  they're capable of telling the truth but you cannot tell the truth and have
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:47.680]  supporters so I think they're both puppets run by the puppeteers and but
[2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:52.680]  the people that are looking for truth like me I mean I have to search I have
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:19:02.080]  to search for truth because it doesn't it's just not out there well I agree
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:05.280]  with your point that the reason Mitt Romney has to sit there and endorse the
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:09.040]  welfare state and elastobate and argue with Obama on how many goodies you'll
[2:19:09.040 --> 2:19:13.200]  give out is because the American people to a great extent have become
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:16.800]  domesticated independent and they want to hear about the goodies they're gonna
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:20.880]  get and that's that's a scary thing we're gonna go the way of Venezuela if
[2:19:20.880 --> 2:19:29.520]  that continues well I know God's word says that when you won't wisdom you go
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:35.520]  out and you look for it wisdom is there truth is there but it's it's just it's
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:41.880]  gonna come to you after you seek it you know what stay there I don't want to
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:44.920]  cut you short just a minute and a half you've been holding a while and come
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:48.000]  back to you quickly to finish you another point you've got after the break

[2:20:10.440 --> 2:20:13.960]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems
[2:20:13.960 --> 2:20:17.800]  there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but
[2:20:17.800 --> 2:20:21.120]  frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable
[2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:23.960]  foods have been around since the beginning of history with archaeological
[2:20:23.960 --> 2:20:26.840]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe

[2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:35.440]  porges Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy
[2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:39.040]  living but here's some good news South for lion Americans can now discover the

[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:50.560]  really thinking and we wear our heart on our sleeve as I said earlier that's why
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:54.600]  we have you know complex debates we don't try to just dumb it down like a lot of
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:24:58.760]  mainstream media does we believe the people can hear complex ideas and
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:03.360]  different perspectives and then come up with the answer for our society but any
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:12.160]  other points you'd like to make no other than the fact that I put a lot of my
[2:25:12.160 --> 2:25:19.200]  daily decisions and future plans on your radio section because I hear the
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:25.520]  truth a Gerald Solenti some of your other speakers I just thoroughly enjoyed
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:30.240]  them and I thank you so much for taking these people and put them on your show
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:41.880]  so they can share with what your viewers what they think about the economy and the
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:45.960]  political realm and you know I have to say I think Gerald Solente is probably
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:50.360]  on average the most popular guest we have on my mom loves him everybody I know
[2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:54.120]  love Gerald Solente he's he's real even if you don't agree with everything he
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:59.720]  says you you've got he's real he's really talking to you and not playing games
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:03.760]  and that's what people are starving for that's what I'm starving for thanks for
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:08.480]  calling let's go ahead and hey if you like what you're hearing here on local
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:14.400]  station spread the word folks that's so important we're in a fight against
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:18.200]  tyranny and believing that it's unstoppable is it's what's gonna let it
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:23.600]  win we've actually got the power the globalists have a bunch of mindless
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:27.320]  dumbed-down idiots following them who were domesticated or a bunch of crooks
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:34.000]  let's identify these people discredit them and take our country back let's
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:37.560]  talk to Frank in North Carolina listening on an iPhone free iPhone app
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:43.080]  welcome sir hello thanks Alex for taking my call first time caller been
[2:26:43.080 --> 2:26:48.960]  listened to you about 12 years though thank you one of my great concerns is I've
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:53.760]  listened to you and several other folks who are very credible speak of the
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:59.160]  problems we have I've read Lindsay Williams first book in 1982 and I've
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:04.440]  kind of been tuned into that since my fear is this I have actually witnessed
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:09.320]  when someone is being attacked on the street and people roll up the window in
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:13.480]  their car turn up the radio don't go to the window in their apartment hoping
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:17.120]  that they won't hear it anymore and I get the feeling in this country that
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:21.000]  that's beginning to happen not beginning it has been happening and
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:25.440]  continuing to happen but the screaming on the street and the attack is getting
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:31.960]  louder and they're still turning up the radio well and because of that I know
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:35.920]  it's probably sounds almost harebrained I have conceived of an approach that I
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:40.440]  think could work I don't know that it would I don't even know that part of
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:45.840]  the people is there but I think it the only way to actually retrieve our
[2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:50.680]  Republic or we take it back well I want to hear your idea but it's funny I'm
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:57.320]  writing an article the next few days about turning point tipping point and I
[2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:00.720]  was going to use exactly what you talked about examples in the news where a
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:05.000]  woman's being raped you know there was a case in Toronto in front of hundreds of
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:09.840]  people business people and they will watch it as entertainment out their
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:15.520]  window and the manager said don't call the cops you know get back to work and
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:21.360]  it's it's the violent video games the culture death is funny people on talk
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:25.880]  radio now the trendies I hear it make fun of cripples and people I mean it's
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:29.800]  really sick to get us to where everything's just entertainment and we're
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:33.560]  totally dehumanized show the globalist can run over us and it's done on
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:39.120]  purpose and they had a case to him a few years ago where an Austin cop got run
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:43.640]  over on a major side street and literally hundreds of cars drove by for an
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:46.840]  hour and no one helped as he rolled around bleeding to death and there's
[2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:50.760]  there's just so many examples of that and I'm not saying I'm a great guy I'm
[2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:53.800]  gonna hold you over to finish your pointer or get back to you here but
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:29:01.520]  while this thoughts clear I mean I told the story of walking out of the bathroom
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:05.720]  I heard screaming my wife and my son this is so long it was like nine years
[2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:10.800]  ago he was a baby and I hear yelling so I walk out and this has been going on for
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:15.160]  couple minutes and the woman was choking turning blue over on the table
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:19.760]  everyone was standing around like birds going 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 literally
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:24.400]  chirping 9-1-1 and I walked over and I said do the Heimlich did anybody know
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:28.800]  do that and everybody's like 9-1-1 wait for the ambulance and I said no she'll
[2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:33.280]  be dead by then let me in there are you trained in that I said yes start pushing
[2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:36.720]  in but and they were like and then as soon as I saved her then I was the
[2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:39.080]  hero but I got out of there they probably want to sue me or something
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:43.520]  she was big I had to really get in there to get the food out of her and the
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:48.000]  point is you said I'm that's not heroic to save some woman they were all gonna
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:54.720]  stand there like 25 of them we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[2:29:54.720 --> 2:29:58.840]  and the GCN radio network
[2:30:00.400 --> 2:30:04.560]  Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and
[2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:08.440]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[2:30:08.440 --> 2:30:12.360]  cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:16.320]  yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes

[2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:55.600]  all right Lance paleo Derek Taelin Frank we're getting to you I'm just just
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:01.880]  briefly finishing my story here time and time again in my life I've seen
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:06.800]  somebody getting mugged or I've seen a car flip and run off the ditch and seen
[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:10.520]  cars ahead of me not help so I pull over and help them and it's not because I'm
[2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:17.520]  some goody to shoot that's a normal thing to do is to help somebody but I don't
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:20.720]  tell the story properly when I walk out this woman's choking start to fall over
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:25.160]  the table and I'm and I'm waiting going somebody to the Heimlich and they're
[2:34:25.160 --> 2:34:32.520]  literally going we're calling 911 911 911 I mean just like parrots but not
[2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:37.920]  in the parrot voice like 911 911 men and women just men all knitting around all
[2:34:37.920 --> 2:34:42.880]  wimpily night and it was a jammed you know seven o'clock at night Lomato line
[2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:48.080]  French restaurant okay so we're in there and I have to push them out of the way
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:51.200]  they're getting mad they're yelling at me while I'm doing it I do the Heimlich
[2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:56.000]  saver big thing of bread down her throat she's falling back getting air I
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:00.960]  mean she was gonna die she would have died before the police got there maybe a
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:03.360]  cop was two minutes away he might have got in there and done the Heimlich
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:07.240]  oh he's wearing a uniform well it's okay for him to do it but the point is and I
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:10.760]  you know took a Heimlich course or wherever one of those basic day courses
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:15.280]  when I was on swim team back in Dallas but I'm not some hero for doing that
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:20.600]  it's this idea that that you don't get involved I mean if I see people robbing
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:25.400]  my neighbor's house I mean that's actually kind of I'm not excited about it
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:29.640]  but I mean I'm gonna go pull out my Reaper 308 rifle and I'm going over there
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:32.560]  and and if they don't get down on the ground and they've got a weapon they're
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:37.040]  dead I mean I'll kill you I mean it's real simple and it's not because I'm
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:40.240]  looking to kill people I've got an instinct though that somebody's
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:45.400]  threatening me somebody's robbing me switch is flipped now I'm meet Mr. Killer
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:49.120]  and it's not that it's bad to be a killer it's bad to be a killer that hurts
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:54.400]  innocent people see I'm a loving person so I have a killer switch I can throw
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:59.120]  and you've all got that switch it's just been engineered out of you I've also
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:03.760]  got my fight tyrant switch I've got my resistance switch and that's what I've
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:08.120]  been flipping here okay and I'm now ranting sir you're absolutely right I'm
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:11.480]  writing an article about this this is the this is at the heart of it it's so
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:15.440]  funny you called in well it's it's not funny it's it's it's providence that
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:22.280]  everything is about this helplessness this spectator mode I'm just because I
[2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:27.040]  see in the news all the time where a woman's choking they let her die waiting
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.360]  for the ambulance or the cops are so dumb down like the public that they
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:35.520]  put they go to the house the people call 9-1-1 he's falling down he's having a
[2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:41.680]  seizure cop car comes they get there first stop moving he's not moving taser
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:48.680]  him Bob hey he's having a seizure he's unconscious idiots again I mean it's so
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:55.000]  scary how dumb the public is how dumb many of the police are how dumb I'm
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.560]  ranting and I've got calls in this clip I've got to get to sure give us your idea
[2:36:58.560 --> 2:37:05.160]  along those lines I just can't wait to hear it Frank in North Carolina Alex
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:12.360]  thank you and I will try and talk quickly the the thing is that so many
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:17.160]  people have been jaded now against becoming involved and that and that has
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:23.120]  gone very deep inside them so they have really clustered themselves away from the
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:26.760]  public I mean I was gonna give mouth to mouth that someone says well what if he's
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:30.080]  got something I don't want God can protect you from infections but save the
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:35.000]  man's life anyway go back and tell your story you said you saw someone being
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:39.080]  attacked and no one would help them they were rolling up their windows yeah
[2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:43.040]  yeah well I did see that but I'm afraid I'll run out I wanted to tell you what
[2:37:43.040 --> 2:37:49.600]  my my thoughts were on how to take back the Republic sure I mean I'm listening
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:56.160]  go ahead so anyway the well what one of the one of them if you want one of the
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:38:00.920]  things that happens I was out on the road this this a this elderly couple was
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:05.320]  hit by a tank truck and there was fuel all around the car and the husband was
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:10.120]  standing out mesmerized around the car and everybody was standing there saying
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:15.160]  you know oh oh what if he catches it but nobody even walked in to help them and I
[2:38:15.160 --> 2:38:19.680]  got out of the car and not cuz I'm a hero but I ran in got them and walked them
[2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:23.200]  out I didn't really take the time to think about it because they're human
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:27.560]  life and exactly and the jellyfish that think they're protected because they
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:31.880]  don't get involved politically they don't speak up at the PTA you know the
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:37.320]  smart money now is on not getting involved but when everybody does that you
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:42.400]  lose the whole society that's the great danger like I said yesterday if you're
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:45.120]  willing to give up your life for freedom you're probably not gonna have to
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:48.240]  give it up but when you're willing to give up nothing you're gonna get
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:53.360]  slavery you and again a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves go ahead and
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:58.160]  finish your story now what's the political idea well I know it's crazy
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:03.840]  but don't tell me the idea tell me the idea okay okay if I think the only way
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:08.160]  to take back the Republic is constitutionally speaking because why do
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:12.320]  something without it remaining within the Constitution as we want to stand for
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:16.160]  and that's gonna be through our governors and our local sheriffs I think
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:19.800]  most people do not perceive that it's bad enough that we could lose this
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:25.480]  country like in the movie America from 1987 exactly no it's it's going to
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:29.560]  happen with Chris Chris Coverson we're that's the globalist plan and all these
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:35.400]  people think keeping their head down I heard an ad for a big Texas bank
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:40.320]  yesterday on the radio that said you work hard you keep your head down
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.440]  politically you know we're a Texas bank good job keeping out of things you just
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:50.000]  make money and it's like this attitude because it's not just cowards there's
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.640]  so many men I talked to they go you're not gonna change anything just make
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:56.360]  money hey idiot you're not gonna have a country to spend that money in or a
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:00.600]  future if you don't get involved now I agree with you sir this is dangerous so
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:04.680]  what's your idea tell us what do you say to people if we got the governors to
[2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:08.240]  come together some wouldn't want to but a lot of peer pressure there and we
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:12.640]  formed a committee with a chair and the committee and the chair said we have
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:17.960]  got to take this to the military into Washington and what they would do is
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:22.400]  they would then go each governor could call all those county sheriffs together
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:27.320]  for a meeting and say look we we will in such and such day two days three days
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:34.040]  from now we will be approaching the the the the military and we are going to
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:38.600]  take back this country and you need to each one of you tell the people in your
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:42.560]  county that they need to contact their family in the military you need to stand
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:46.800]  for this country you're not family and because we are losing it and it's going
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:50.720]  down the tubes and when it's all gone I agree oh I didn't know what that I agree
[2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:55.520]  it's now time when people make fun of you or family about this hey how about you
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:59.040]  never talk to me again this is that important and I'm not saying break up
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:03.080]  families either forgive your family let them be idiots don't try to sell them on
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:07.160]  freedom but if they want to get nasty with you because you care and they act
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:10.640]  like that's bad well those those aren't people you want to be around anyways
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:13.960]  that's not family but listen let me expand on this what you're talking about
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:19.000]  is what the John Warner Defense Authorization Act is set up to stop and
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.800]  that's Bush by the way because they're all just puppets at that level the John
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:28.960]  Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 sets up Homeland Security to take over
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:33.600]  the states with the army if the governors or legislatures are in insurrection
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:37.200]  well the governors and legislature can't be an insurrection they created the
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:41.200]  federal government the federal government itself has been taken over by
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:44.640]  the globalist they brag it's a coup d'etat over America first issue in the
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:50.360]  magazine covers that the economic collapse when the October issue or the
[2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:55.440]  the September issue excuse me and and that's what the whole art they know that
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:59.120]  that's one of the few shots we've got because it could be legitimately done
[2:41:59.120 --> 2:42:03.480]  what do we follow a bill of rights Constitution we get back to that and if
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:07.040]  you send the message that people are gonna stand up others will join us this
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:11.640]  is also the kind of thing that you know really is dangerous even be pushing
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:17.000]  because it is the solution and you've got to you know just basically word-to-word
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:20.520]  hey we need to have an emergency committee to save the republic and
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  governors that understand it and who aren't globalist controlled need to
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:27.880]  stand up and say you've got your fake governor's council of ten over the ten
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:32.160]  regions this is the real governor's council and we understand that
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:35.680]  everything's gonna collapse even corrupt governors you know they're not gonna
[2:42:35.680 --> 2:42:39.480]  have a seat at the table this is a bad thing we're going into even evil people
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:43.560]  need to understand this is not a good road for anybody except for the very
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:47.120]  very top globalists who serve something so dark you know it's hard to even
[2:42:47.120 --> 2:42:53.120]  describe or quantify and that is the solution it is the states it is people
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:57.600]  getting aggressive politically at city council county commissioners state
[2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:01.440]  houses talk radio people are getting aggressive they're putting this show on
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:04.760]  all over the country station owners and people because they realized well this
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:08.280]  guy really knew what he was talking about we are in deep trouble yeah I'm not
[2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:12.360]  glad I've been proven right I just got a big chill right there thinking about how
[2:43:12.360 --> 2:43:16.720]  much trouble we're in brother so everybody should put forward their own
[2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:23.360]  plans of how to organize to just basically have like a new declaration of
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:26.560]  independence by the states that I appreciate your call sir that's how I
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:31.240]  would do it is we need to have a conclave or a meeting just as the 13
[2:43:31.240 --> 2:43:37.960]  states did a new continental Congress a states emergency Congress that's what
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:42.640]  I call it a states emergency Congress to go okay here's all the mainstream news
[2:43:42.640 --> 2:43:46.000]  saying what the federal government's been conquered by foreign making cartels
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:51.280]  their plan is to shut us down financially to consolidate us further we
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:55.880]  are under economic warfare a new type of modern war we need to identify this new
[2:43:55.880 --> 2:44:00.440]  enemy attack we need to be we need to understand it's the Federal Reserve we
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:03.840]  need to offer people in the Fed governors who want to defect to the
[2:44:03.840 --> 2:44:06.880]  Republic because a lot of them got recruited and aren't pure evil themselves
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:11.320]  you need to choose which side you're on right now and we're getting rid of this
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:16.280]  and and then make declarations folks Texas tried to say we're not gonna let
[2:44:16.280 --> 2:44:20.600]  TSA stick their hands down people's pants and the feds two years ago said
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:25.040]  we're gonna have an armed aircraft blockade by the US Air Force and shoot
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:30.160]  down aircraft that try to come into Texas that was in the news that's
[2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:34.040]  that's that's that's Homeland Security folks that Homeland Security represents
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:39.640]  the foreign banks I mean we're getting down to the real heart now and they know
[2:44:39.640 --> 2:44:44.920]  that's where this is going in Obama's second term is secession I'm not saying
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:48.720]  secession restoring the Republic they're gonna call that secession though
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:51.720]  that's why they're building him as Abraham Lincoln and selling a new Civil
[2:44:51.720 --> 2:44:54.600]  War which they're gonna have the military and police start with veterans
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:58.560]  and they're gonna call those of us that don't hand in our guns terrorist I've
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:02.200]  already seen the whole war game laid out I've reconstructed it from different
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:06.520]  pieces and now we're dead sure that's one of their major plans they've got some
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:09.880]  other sick avenues it's kind of like those books they can have three or four
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:14.880]  different endings you've seen those books they can have a bunch of different
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:18.840]  endings got choose your own adventure it starts one way and they got two or
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:22.760]  three different things they can do and I'm telling you folks they're taking us
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:26.280]  down something that's not an adventure it's a nightmare and it's time for
[2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:31.120]  everybody just to choose where they stand the reason I get chills when I
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:35.800]  think about this is it's real and my nervous system is like hey get ready I
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:40.320]  brains like you know get on edge you're in danger because when I step into these
[2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:45.120]  points and make these points it puts me directly under the eye of Soran I mean
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:49.920]  they they do they are they do not like what I'm talking about right now okay so
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:52.800]  I know I'm putting my life on the line when I even talk about things like this
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:56.880]  because this is a real takeover these people do not play games they put al-Qaeda
[2:45:56.880 --> 2:46:01.200]  into North Africa just to take over and let them line up black people and machine
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:06.560]  gun them by the tens of thousands I mean these people laugh on TV about new
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:11.840]  wars they're gonna start and get crazy looks in their eyes these are crazy
[2:46:11.840 --> 2:46:18.200]  people crazy power mad demons that are in control and and what do we have to
[2:46:18.200 --> 2:46:22.320]  lose it's just gonna get worse if they're in charge they're not gonna stop
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:24.920]  till we have World War three with the Russians I'm telling you folks these
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:29.960]  people have to be stopped the globalist the new world order the eugenicists are
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:35.800]  crazy their new world order is crazy it's straight from the pits of hell okay
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:40.760]  literally literally literally let's start I'm gonna have to skip this
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:44.600]  network break I shouldn't do this I do this almost every day and you know the
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:49.040]  network hardly put turns of profit and so do I it's got the money bomb tomorrow
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:53.360]  and our sponsors are all great if it's direct.com forward slash Alex you know
[2:46:53.360 --> 2:46:58.240]  get six free meals to test them out of you on all the M4 store.com all of it
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:01.600]  but I've got to start getting to this gun thing as I said I would it's like eight
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:05.480]  nine minutes long I'm trying to play it all but here is the whole exchange on
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:09.840]  fashion furious and then both of them with their anti-gun agenda and Obama
[2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:13.880]  saying he does want to ban your semi-autos that's what a soul weapons ban is
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:18.040]  and wants to designate you psychologically bad to take your guns so
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:21.920]  you know for me this is the one point where I was like well at least Romney
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:25.320]  says he's not coming for my guns now even though I probably can't believe him
[2:47:25.320 --> 2:47:29.400]  he can be held to that commitment but Obama's telling me he's coming for my
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:33.880]  guns and I'm gonna just stay out of this and maybe we should maybe it just get
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:40.740]  Obama in there and just let him try to take the country over. If I was the
[2:47:40.740 --> 2:47:43.840]  police and military I'd be asking myself one thing are you ready for this
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:47.440]  Civil War because they're gonna send you in against people and they're gonna
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:51.560]  have you know blowing up farmhouses and shooting people and yeah these terrorists
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:54.640]  got it you're gonna be able to wipe out the first groups of patriots you go
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:47:57.520]  after but then people aren't gonna be waiting for you at their houses they're
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:02.440]  gonna come after you and I know you're training for that I mean you really want
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:07.000]  a bunch of global banker collectivist criminals to have you start a civil war
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:10.560]  in America this is really what you want you really wanted to you really want to
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:14.600]  sign on with the devil because I'm telling you folks that's where this is
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:21.200]  headed this isn't a game let's go ahead and start going to the clip here's the
[2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:25.840]  out-of-control domesticated woman who thinks guns are bad in the hands of the
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:30.560]  citizens here it is. President Obama during the Democratic National Convention
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:38.000]  in 2008 you stated you wanted to keep AK-47s out at the hands of criminals what
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:43.520]  has your administration done or planned to do? This one I'll never get to the
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:45.800]  eight or nine minutes maybe I should go on the nightly news tonight it's all
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:50.360]  baloney or during the money bond tomorrow that starts 48 hour broadcast they're
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:56.960]  not AK-47s moron they're semi-automatic variants and by the way that's good
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:03.080]  they're semi-auto you're your obsession with full auto they're not AK-47s they're
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:06.680]  semi-automatic versions and most crimes aren't committed with those by the way
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:11.680]  Obama says that he says he wants the handguns yeah I know you want the handguns
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:14.960]  harder to get those life people at checkpoints let's go ahead and go back to
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:21.440]  this to limit the availability of assault weapons there were a nation that
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:25.800]  believes in the Second Amendment and I pause again back it up I just every bit
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:28.440]  of its bull you believe in the Second Amendment kind of like he said he
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:34.040]  believes in small businesses when he says you didn't build that but their new
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:37.360]  argument is the Second Amendment means you turn your guns in go back to it I'm
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:44.360]  sorry go back to it yeah we've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:47.360]  it's not about hunting you know that liar want to make sure they can protect
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:52.640]  themselves but there have been too many instances during the course of my
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:56.120]  presidency where I've had to come people can't protect themselves in Chicago or
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:00.920]  New York where you don't have guns most recently out in the war oh yeah that
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:07.880]  thing you stage a couple of weeks ago actually I don't fool me I saw a mother
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:13.960]  who I've met at the bedside of her son these people be any more sheep like when
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:19.600]  you watch video of them and her son had been shot through the head and we spent
[2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:26.440]  some time and we said a prayer oh a prayer and remarkably about two months
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:33.160]  later this young man and his mom showed up and he looked unbelievable now he's
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:37.640]  going to be letting Christians what are you binning him a lot of families who
[2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:43.040]  didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't
[2:50:43.040 --> 2:50:50.640]  survive so my belief is that a we have to enforce the laws we've already got make
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:53.400]  sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals my shipping them to
[2:50:53.400 --> 2:50:58.360]  Mexico mentally ill we've done a much better job in terms of background
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:03.240]  checks but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement but I also share
[2:51:03.240 --> 2:51:08.560]  your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters
[2:51:08.560 --> 2:51:14.200]  don't belong on our streets oh really we need warfare weapons is to get a
[2:51:14.200 --> 2:51:18.120]  broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally part of
[2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:23.840]  it is these control freaks the fact that we have firearms and they can do it
[2:51:23.840 --> 2:51:28.160]  doesn't it in Russia but part of it is also looking at other sources of the
[2:51:28.160 --> 2:51:31.760]  violence because frankly in my hometown of Chicago there's an awful lot of
[2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:36.160]  violence and they're not using AK-47s they're using cheap handguns and so what
[2:51:36.160 --> 2:51:40.800]  can we do to intervene to make sure that young disarm people of Chicago so the
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:45.880]  criminals all the other schools are working that if there's violence on the
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:49.520]  streets that working with faith groups and law enforcement we can catch it
[2:51:49.520 --> 2:51:54.320]  before it gets out of control that means having church is a comprehensive
[2:51:54.320 --> 2:52:00.400]  strategy part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks
[2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:06.840]  in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals the mentally ill okay scum
[2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:12.480]  liar he's just following a anti-gun script from the Violence Policy Center
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:18.480]  in George Soros Obama you know you can't buy full-auto weapons and they use that
[2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:22.920]  that poor woman he's like has crazed eyes when she talks about assault weapons
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:28.320]  machine guns number one lady special forces don't put their guns on full
[2:52:28.320 --> 2:52:33.000]  auto full auto is a lot safer than actually somebody knowing where they're
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:37.040]  putting the bullets I'm just I'm so sick of idiots know nothing about guns now
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:41.560]  Obama knows all about him he's lying saying criminals have full auto the
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:47.920]  only criminals that have full auto are the ones that got it from US military
[2:52:47.920 --> 2:52:52.800]  personnel in black ops who were ordered to ship full auto into Mexico to
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:58.840]  destabilize that country and the big US banks and Western banks caught giving
[2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:04.120]  full autos and armored vehicles and planes to the drug dealers because they
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:08.840]  run the drug operations Wells Fargo Wacovia they all got caught running the
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:14.120]  aircraft funding the guns all of it shut up when you talk about death and
[2:53:14.120 --> 2:53:18.880]  destruction how you care about people what a joke Obama what a joke we all
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:23.720]  know about the CIA and Mina Arkansas we all know about fast and furious we all
[2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:28.880]  know about Iran Contra don't sit there and talk about some individual you know
[2:53:28.880 --> 2:53:33.200]  you know they got shot in the head and how terrible the automatic weapons are
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:38.880]  the only people selling automatic weapons are given amount are you so you
[2:53:38.880 --> 2:53:42.600]  could blame our second amendment let's go back to him here but part of it is
[2:53:42.600 --> 2:53:46.600]  also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making
[2:53:46.600 --> 2:53:51.040]  sure we catch violent impulses before they occur governor Romney the question
[2:53:51.040 --> 2:53:56.320]  is about assault weapons thank you 47 yeah I I'm not in favor of new pause of
[2:53:56.320 --> 2:54:03.340]  lettuce Alistair Crowley is so arrogant and loves her power and like a big fat
[2:54:03.340 --> 2:54:07.160]  parrot sitting up there in front of people on television these ego maniacs
[2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:12.240]  just relish being on air they just love it they just absolutely love it I'm here
[2:54:12.240 --> 2:54:16.460]  because I have to be I don't want to be here and I've been around these ego
[2:54:16.460 --> 2:54:21.280]  maniacs I was talking off-air to Joe curl the Washington Times I need to get him
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:26.160]  back to the story he was naming the names of these national TV people just
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:33.000]  laughing and giggling and talking about all this my and laughing during the
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:38.120]  debate and and laughing at how they knew you know stuff was lies but still
[2:54:38.120 --> 2:54:42.520]  supporting Obama I mean it's so it wasn't secret what he was telling we just
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:44.960]  never got to it on air we're talking to her to break he talked about some of it
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:51.160]  on there it's just it's funny to them it's it's it's I mean I've been around it
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:55.320]  to I've been to these national events and to the RNC and DNC and stuff and it
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:54:59.440]  they love the fact the public's dumb it's funny to them to sit there and lie
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:03.920]  to everybody Obama and Alistair Crowley and all those you know the moderator
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:09.800]  they all know that that there's not fully auto out there they all know that
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:14.480]  fast and furious ship guns into Chicago and Indianapolis and Tampa and other
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:19.040]  areas and it came out they all know it's just a sick joke to them posing like
[2:55:19.040 --> 2:55:23.480]  they're the Humanitarians let's play some more of a mission done on guns and
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:27.480]  and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal we of course don't want to
[2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:30.640]  have automatic weapons and that's already illegal in this country to have
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:34.720]  automatic weapons job Romney what I believe is we have to do is the
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:37.720]  president mentioned but towards the end of his remarks there which is to make
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:43.280]  enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have and to change the
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:47.720]  culture of violence we have and you ask how we're gonna do that and there are
[2:55:47.720 --> 2:55:50.720]  a number of things he mentioned good schools I totally agree we were able to
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:54.760]  drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state and I believe if
[2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:58.280]  we do a better job in education we'll we'll give people the the hope and
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:01.000]  opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that but let me
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:05.520]  mention another thing and that is parents we need moms and dads helping
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:09.760]  raise kids yo wow wherever possible parents are needed oh two parents in the
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:13.240]  home and that's not always possible state doesn't like single mom single dads
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:17.280]  but gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies they ought to think
[2:56:17.280 --> 2:56:21.000]  about getting married to someone that's a great idea oh yeah because if there's a
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:25.480]  two-parent family the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically got
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.560]  four jobs opportunities that the child will will be able to achieve increase
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:34.680]  dramatically so we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:37.960]  people away from violence and give them opportunity and bring them in the
[2:56:37.960 --> 2:56:42.160]  American system the one the greatest failure we've had with regards to gun
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:47.400]  violence in some respects is what what is known as fast and furious oh it was a
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:51.640]  program under this administration and how it worked exactly I think we don't
[2:56:51.640 --> 2:56:57.920]  know precisely but where we do of automatic and AK set 47 type weapons
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:02.560]  were we're given to people that ultimately gave them to drug lords they
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:10.040]  use those weapons against against their own 90 seven that Chinese government
[2:57:10.040 --> 2:57:14.840]  for what purpose it was put in place I can't imagine it was one of the well
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:20.760]  since you can't imagine I told you this over a year ago but ABC News and CBS
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:26.200]  earlier this year it was the memos have come out in Congress that was to be
[2:57:26.200 --> 2:57:32.120]  blamed on the Second Amendment and Obama went ahead and still did that along
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:37.560]  with Holdren Eric Holder I mean I am just tired of it let let's go back to more
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:41.960]  of this more of this disgustingness a great tragedies related to violence in
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:45.160]  our society which has occurred during this administration which I think the
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:49.400]  American people would like to understand fully it's been investigated to a
[2:57:49.400 --> 2:57:55.200]  degree but but the administration has as a as carried out executive privilege to
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:59.000]  prevent all the information from coming out I'd like to understand who it was
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:03.520]  that did this what the ideal was behind it why it led to the violence thousands
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:08.960]  of guns going to Mexican drug lords governor if I could the question was
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:14.320]  about these assault weapons good pause or ban there you go a slapdown and of

[2:59:58.400 --> 3:00:07.040]  network network
[3:00:07.040 --> 3:00:12.800]  you walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future not a
[3:00:12.800 --> 3:00:18.920]  future that will be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:24.360]  an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every
[3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:28.360]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of his
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:34.120]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:39.560]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:45.360]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:01:02.520]  is an enemy and truth is a menace the answer to 1984 is 1776 that's right
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:09.240]  listening to the Alex Jones show all right let's go to paleo in Florida
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:17.640]  thanks for holding you're on the air you heard candy Crowley I call her Alistair
[3:01:17.640 --> 3:01:22.680]  Crowley and drag say that fast and furious has nothing to do with crimes
[3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:26.600]  being commited with guns and she said so and she said that the president said
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:30.960]  that was a terror attack day one in Benghazi and she said the Sun didn't come
[3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:34.440]  up this morning too and well the last time I checked it's dark outside she's
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:41.600]  right so there you go she's God what's your comment or question today sir yeah
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:45.720]  how you doing Alex good I just want to let you know you're doing a wonderful
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:49.800]  thing with exposing the luminosity and help I want to take care of the guns and
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:54.360]  all that but the void about everything is I need you to go back to your route
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:59.440]  Alex where you went on to how we'd wonder what and that that me I like who you
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:03.720]  were then because you're telling me the truth then that's not my roots I think
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:09.920]  I was in Kevin's film like three or four years ago exposing the fact that
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:14.080]  marijuana should be decriminalized I talked about that yesterday actually at
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:19.800]  some length or yeah you know no it was Monday so I mean I cover it all just
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:22.560]  because you tune in and don't hear me covering something at one time doesn't
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:28.600]  mean that you know I don't cover it no Alex I always listen to you and I like
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:32.880]  I said I love your work when you expose the luminosity and all you bring in is
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:36.240]  health range and all that but then you have other people that are trying to
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:39.080]  give you nutrients that are really nutrients you know they're giving me
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:43.120]  powder form and we all know where real food is you can't preserve it you can't
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:46.640]  put in plastic you can't you can't that's just what it is you can't put it in a
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:50.360]  fridge in a fridge and expect it to still be alive that's just the truth about
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:53.520]  everything Alex that's why I need you to be talking about these people that's
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:56.560]  about the luminosity and the gold because that they're never going to
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:03:00.200]  understand that because they can't even understand their own their own feet it
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:05.480]  just well we're trying the best we can I hear you though Lance and you
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:11.720]  you're on the air welcome thank you as a I guess I could live on myself an
[3:03:11.720 --> 3:03:14.880]  info warren Mormon and I wanted to give you a little bit of insight I have on
[3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:19.280]  Mitt Romney because I guess in a way I'm close to really close to that family in
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:24.840]  a sense that I have I'm one person away from him but but I think I think I'll
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:29.280]  help people to clarify who Romney is a little bit more within this construct
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:34.600]  and I just want to I just want to mention that I'm a full-warrant Paul
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:38.880]  supporter but I noticed that the elite do not like what Mitt Romney didn't like
[3:03:38.880 --> 3:03:44.760]  him in the first time he ran they they they consider him a lesser of two
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:49.760]  goods if you will and that's why they always put other people in front of
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:54.640]  them throughout the whole debates because at Romney's core and I can I can
[3:03:54.640 --> 3:03:59.000]  really attest to this and it's the same opinion I think Joe Scalvin has yes he's
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:03.080]  deceived and he's been in the corporate world he's been wrapped up in making
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:07.560]  money his whole life and he's just now but I mean it is a tenet of his religious
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:11.840]  faith that the the Constitution is a divine document it's actually I think
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:15.440]  with only religion that I am aware of that I actually believe that it really
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:22.200]  truly is it was it's it's canonized in our scriptures as a divine document and
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:27.360]  so Mitt Romney it I consider him to be like I was about 10 years ago before I
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:33.800]  woke up tell this this crap and so he I've seen him yes he flip-flops but I've
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:40.200]  flip-flopped as I've woken up but I see him as a at this core a very good man I
[3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:44.800]  mean instead of secretly worship worshiping Lucifer in his private time
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:48.800]  he secretly worships Christ and I really believe that is we're out of time for
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:52.520]  this segment we'll have to cover it more on the nightly news tonight 7 o'clock in
[3:04:52.520 --> 3:04:58.120]  a 48-hour transmission tomorrow there's the moderator we found a bitch of her two
[3:04:58.120 --> 3:05:23.520]  different photos of her
