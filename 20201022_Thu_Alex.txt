[00:00.000 --> 00:08.740]  Just because the mainstream media was barely there to cover antifa and BLM and arcus chaos doesn't mean it didn't happen
[00:08.740 --> 00:15.960]  What you're seeing behind me is one of multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin over the course of the night
[00:16.320 --> 00:24.480]  Fortunately for the rest of us a hard-charging group of citizen journalists captured everything and posted it all on social media for the world to see
[00:24.480 --> 00:31.520]  They're stoking fears about black and brown Americans lying about how minorities will destroy the suburbs
[00:31.960 --> 00:33.120]  Ain't nothing left here
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.800]  So when we start coming to the suburbs when we come to the government center, then what's all gonna do?
[00:37.800 --> 00:41.080]  You see what I'm saying? So hey, that's just what's gonna happen, you know
[00:41.600 --> 00:47.600]  Apparently the Associated Press didn't see it and has now slid rapidly into the quicksand of propaganda
[00:47.600 --> 00:55.760]  Writing president Donald Trump portrays the hundreds of people arrested nationwide in protests against racial injustice as
[00:56.240 --> 01:03.040]  Violent urban left-wing radicals, but an Associated Press review of thousands of pages of court documents
[01:03.080 --> 01:09.360]  Tells a different story very few of those charged appear to be affiliated with highly organized
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.560]  extremist groups and many are young suburban adults from the very neighborhoods
[01:14.560 --> 01:23.120]  Trump vows to protect from the violence in his reelection push to win support from the suburbs defense attorneys and civil rights activists are
[01:23.240 --> 01:29.920]  Questioning why the Department of Justice has taken on cases to begin with they say most belong in state court
[01:29.920 --> 01:38.320]  Where defendants typically get much lighter sentences and they argue federal authorities appear to be cracking down on protesters in an effort to
[01:38.320 --> 01:45.480]  Stymie demonstrations, but after billions of dollars of property damage roughly 40 people killed as a
[01:45.840 --> 01:47.840]  Direct result of the protests
[01:48.200 --> 01:54.560]  Including the cold-blooded murders of several Trump supporters one of those by a bodyguard of leftist media
[01:54.560 --> 01:58.080]  No less and a culture split in half by Marxist subversion
[01:58.080 --> 02:11.720]  Does the media really expect us to ignore what we have seen with our own eyes?
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.640]  I have a question for you Joe Biden. You said that Antifa is just an idea
[02:20.120 --> 02:23.280]  This is what the idea you're talking about Antifa
[02:23.280 --> 02:29.880]  This is what they did to me not the hospital right now Joe Biden because they're Antifa. So just want to ask you
[02:30.200 --> 02:34.840]  You still think after seeing this that they're just an idea
[02:35.440 --> 02:42.520]  Meanwhile Facebook doubles down on its algorithm to censor those they and more importantly China disagree with
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.840]  Facebook the company operates something called the hate speech engineering team
[02:48.400 --> 02:50.400]  Now how do they know how to?
[02:50.400 --> 02:59.240]  Censor hate speech well at least half a dozen members of the in-house team are in fact Chinese nationals in this country on H1B
[02:59.400 --> 03:05.000]  Visas what the insider told me is that they actually are on the lookout for what they call
[03:06.320 --> 03:07.640]  specifically
[03:07.640 --> 03:12.080]  Borderline content and the whole goal is is as you're surfing your news feed
[03:12.080 --> 03:19.280]  There are certain things they consider quote-unquote borderline content which apparently includes now New York Post reporting reporting for the oldest
[03:19.280 --> 03:21.440]  newspaper in this country which they then
[03:22.480 --> 03:25.400]  Ensure that you see it last on your news feed
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.200]  whereas there are other content that they want you to see for commercial reasons or whatever and
[03:29.400 --> 03:32.560]  The same engineers if they manage to get you to interact with it
[03:32.560 --> 03:40.040]  We'll then get discretionary bonuses according to this insider social media only pours more fuel on the fire of propaganda
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.760]  Aiding those anti-American radical leftists the AP claim don't exist that continue to churn out of our
[03:46.760 --> 03:53.640]  Universities trained in the art of anarchy by professors like midwestern state university philosophy professor
[03:53.760 --> 03:55.880]  Nathan june who wrote on Facebook?
[03:55.880 --> 04:02.120]  I want the entire world to burn until the last cop is strangled with the intestines of the last capitalist
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.120]  Who is strangled in turn with the intestines of the last politician?
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.240]  Hey, this is Nathan John coming to you from Wichita Falls, Texas
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.160]  Thanks to Duane for inviting me to participate in this project
[04:14.160 --> 04:22.800]  So what is anarchist studies? Well, first of all, I think that anarchist studies is a contested term
[04:22.800 --> 04:25.300]  I don't think that there's any
[04:26.400 --> 04:28.400]  real consensus necessarily
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.080]  among those of us who
[04:31.440 --> 04:37.240]  Like to think of ourselves as working in anarchist studies. I think it's something that we're still trying to
[04:37.240 --> 04:45.640]  Figure out what follows in the psychotic mindset is the strangling of all those that disagree with the dangerous narrative
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.080]  dominating these overlords in our media John bound
[05:01.480 --> 05:05.400]  Infection super villains are known as super villains because they have
[05:05.400 --> 05:11.840]  Gigantic huge global plans that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex
[05:11.840 --> 05:14.360]  And I might have told you a year ago back in October
[05:15.200 --> 05:23.480]  2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out a global hysteria and lock down the planet start millions of people and
[05:23.480 --> 05:30.040]  Would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all gonna work
[05:30.040 --> 05:35.440]  From home now and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint and the human population
[05:35.680 --> 05:41.600]  You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia. You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book
[05:41.920 --> 05:47.760]  But in reality it really did happen. His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics
[05:48.320 --> 05:52.160]  Consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago
[05:52.160 --> 05:59.400]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates is built until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill Gates
[06:22.160 --> 06:29.920]  We now take you live to the heart of the resistance
[06:29.920 --> 06:35.960]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance
[06:35.960 --> 06:37.960]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[06:37.960 --> 06:40.960]  And on the road for 26 years
[06:45.960 --> 06:47.960]  All of it getting us in a tax position
[06:47.960 --> 06:49.960]  What's happening right now?
[06:49.960 --> 06:57.040]  She had the whole show and that's a natural fast. They got Satan in his operating system. We've got gods. We're jacked in
[06:57.760 --> 06:59.760]  targeting computer ready
[07:02.920 --> 07:07.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are so honored to be here because we are an American band
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.400]  We're American
[07:11.240 --> 07:15.880]  They've been trying to demoralize us dumb us down and poison us and drug us out of our minds
[07:16.360 --> 07:18.360]  But we're coming to your town
[07:18.360 --> 07:25.000]  We're coming to your country. We're bringing 1776 world-wide. Well, we want you to succeed
[07:25.320 --> 07:27.920]  We want you to throw the globalist chains off
[07:27.920 --> 07:34.160]  We want to see you go to the stars with us because America is an idea an idea whose time has come
[07:36.200 --> 07:40.800]  It will be America that destroys the New World Order will be America that overturns the world government
[07:40.800 --> 07:45.520]  It will be America that is gonna be a key part in defeating the antichrist world system in God's plan
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.520]  Sit back and watch
[07:49.760 --> 07:55.320]  That's what all the fake theologians tell you America isn't in revelations America isn't mentioned all of its pure lies
[07:56.040 --> 07:58.040]  It's all right there for you to see
[07:58.600 --> 08:07.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this transmission Thursday, October 22nd. The quickening is here 11 days. I
[08:08.600 --> 08:13.400]  Won't open the phones up and there was one caller left on hold yesterday who we're gonna call up
[08:13.400 --> 08:17.200]  If he wants to come on it'll be our first caller, but I want to open the phones up for the entire
[08:17.720 --> 08:19.720]  Four hours of the transmission
[08:19.880 --> 08:24.160]  We have James O'Keeffe popping in for one segment in the
[08:25.320 --> 08:30.480]  Third hour and then Bishop Larry Gators with all of his interesting esoteric research
[08:31.360 --> 08:35.920]  Is gonna be coming in I think I'm gonna host a little bit of that time with him as well because I've got some questions for him
[08:37.360 --> 08:39.360]  I want to open the phones up throughout the entire transmission
[08:39.360 --> 08:46.880]  I'll give the number out start of the next segment and you can start your engines and I'm gonna really try to get to a lot of
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  the calls, okay
[08:50.400 --> 08:57.120]  Man look if you're freaked out by what's going on. So am I I mean I knew all this stuff was coming I
[08:58.840 --> 09:00.440]  Knew the globalists
[09:00.440 --> 09:06.320]  Were in control of the planet and I knew they were trying to get greater control over our individual lives and I knew they were really bad people
[09:06.320 --> 09:08.320]  But
[09:08.360 --> 09:14.640]  Now so much has happened the last eight months and they're now so out in the open about what they're gonna do that I
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.960]  Am just flabbergasted that more people aren't supporting boss and Iro
[09:20.480 --> 09:27.400]  More people aren't supporting Trump more people aren't supporting their own secessionist movements, but the truth is
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.360]  Unless it's a sessionist, I mean out of these globalist systems the EU
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.640]  the New World Order WTO the UN
[09:37.880 --> 09:43.920]  But the truth is whether you're in Spain or whether you're in France or whether you're in Nigeria or whether you are in Israel
[09:43.920 --> 09:49.080]  Or whether you are in Russia or whether you are in China. There are people rebelling
[09:50.480 --> 09:57.960]  Against these globalist forces everywhere at record levels and that's why they've used the COVID exaggeration the COVID martial law
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.400]  the planned pandemic
[10:00.400 --> 10:05.760]  The scandemic to lock everything down and they admit. That's what they're doing and
[10:06.960 --> 10:12.440]  So that's really the good news is they're throwing everything. They've got at us right now with this and
[10:13.440 --> 10:15.440]  People aren't buying into it on average
[10:16.280 --> 10:17.640]  people through
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.240]  panoptic
[10:19.240 --> 10:21.240]  pressure though are
[10:21.720 --> 10:28.000]  Still complying with the mask which holds up the facade that the overblown hoax is a reality
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.880]  And that's why they've got a block and censor all the medical doctors and epidemiologists and scientists, but
[10:33.760 --> 10:41.440]  If you study full cult who wrote about the panopticon and if you study the panopticon and the development of modern prisons in France
[10:41.960 --> 10:43.960]  250 years ago
[10:45.600 --> 10:48.000]  They had a round prison ward
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.960]  with a tower that went up three stories or four stories depending on the design and
[10:52.960 --> 10:59.440]  And so that prisoners would feel like they were being watched at all times out of the windows
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  Even though most the time there weren't guards there
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.320]  And so that's what a panopticon is and that's what panopticon surveillance is is you self-enforced
[11:10.320 --> 11:14.960]  So you don't believe in the mask. You don't believe in COVID. You don't but you wear it
[11:14.960 --> 11:20.040]  So I'll be sitting there in a legal meeting. I'll be sitting there at a store. I'll be sitting there wherever and
[11:20.040 --> 11:26.240]  And I'm like, you don't need that mask with me. I I know it's a fraud and most of the time
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.080]  They will pull the mask off
[11:30.600 --> 11:37.400]  Particularly young attractive women. I'll be like boy, it's really sad. I can't see your face. They're like, oh boom that mask comes off and
[11:38.320 --> 11:40.000]  I
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.800]  Was in a store the other day and there were two women behind the counter. They're wearing their masks
[11:43.800 --> 11:45.960]  They're getting something for me. I just said you don't need to wear those masks
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.560]  Well, they kind of make us do it. I said, why don't you just take them off?
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.440]  You know, it's a fraud. You know, it's a lie. So I heard that my brother said that I was reading that like, okay
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.880]  Yeah, and and we just have to do that and
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.920]  I annoy I annoy the crew when they go out me. I know my children. I know my my wife's on board
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.560]  She she's about as bad as I am now tell me what's fraud and we just go to the park anywhere
[12:08.560 --> 12:10.920]  We just go. Oh, you're jogging, but you're wearing a mask
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.800]  I mean the American Airlines Association and the International Association came out a week ago
[12:15.800 --> 12:18.880]  I think we print me that guy's you're the ones that brought it to me you
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.160]  Where you've got a 1 in 23 million chance of getting COVID on an airplane. I mean folks
[12:26.680 --> 12:32.760]  Why is it you're not getting super spread on these airplanes because it's an overblown fraud and again
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.760]  I know 99% of you know this but for the 1%
[12:36.280 --> 12:38.440]  That just tuned in I want you to know this
[12:38.440 --> 12:46.600]  You will die without vitamin D vitamin C and zinc of any virus your your cells will stop working and
[12:47.040 --> 12:53.400]  Anything can invade and take over your cells because they malfunction because the mitochondria cannot give orders to the cells
[12:53.400 --> 12:59.160]  If it does not have those and it's not just three things most people end up being deficient in D
[12:59.480 --> 13:06.960]  Because of the winter see because are any leafy green vegetables or citrus at proper levels and zinc
[13:06.960 --> 13:12.880]  But there's 13 vitamins that if you don't have them you die and a bunch of minerals you don't have you die
[13:12.880 --> 13:15.280]  And you need the other ones to be healthy. So I
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.280]  Got hundreds of articles hundreds of things to cover
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.960]  I just want to say again because the falls here and people don't get malnutrition and you're gonna die the flu
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.800]  You're gonna die of a cold. You're gonna die of pneumonia. You're gonna die of COVID
[13:28.520 --> 13:30.520]  You're gonna die of tuberculosis
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.080]  You think homeless have high levels of tuberculosis just because they are
[13:35.080 --> 13:39.280]  Our homeless know that they're taking drugs and they're not eating good food
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.880]  They're eating gas station food and they're taking drugs and they're sleeping outside and their bodies are run down
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.760]  They're all skinny. You ever see fat homeless people very rarely because they're spending all the money on drugs
[13:50.760 --> 13:55.240]  And that's why they've almost all got TB folks because they're run down
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.360]  Like oh, why'd my engine blow I hadn't put oil in it in two years
[14:01.800 --> 14:03.800]  You could have a brand new car and
[14:03.800 --> 14:10.240]  In six eight months if you hadn't changed that oil or you had an oil leak and there's no oil in there in days
[14:11.440 --> 14:15.640]  Hell if you're driving down the road without oil your engine will seize up in ten minutes and
[14:16.840 --> 14:18.840]  again
[14:18.840 --> 14:22.000]  These aren't weapons God gave us these are
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.720]  Things we have to have it's not like they go. Oh vitamin D is a weapon against COVID
[14:27.720 --> 14:35.480]  Vitamin C is a weapon against it. Oh fish oil is a weapon against Alzheimer's if you don't have essential fatty acids
[14:35.480 --> 14:37.480]  That are clean your brain short circuits
[14:38.120 --> 14:43.840]  So I'm gonna stop I'm gonna stop I'm gonna come back and hit the big hunter-biden news the big debate news the big
[14:45.040 --> 14:48.320]  Election fraud news that's so huge that I don't even know how to respond to this
[14:48.320 --> 14:52.600]  I mean, this is so big that I should not even be on air right now, okay?
[14:52.600 --> 14:55.440]  I barely got on air because of this and
[14:55.440 --> 15:00.560]  I'm sitting there looking at this and I'm just like
[15:02.840 --> 15:08.400]  You know what real journalists are like real journalists are like FBI agents or what they used to be
[15:08.600 --> 15:13.360]  That's all you do you go out to a place you get the proof you show it to people you document it
[15:13.920 --> 15:16.480]  But I don't have the money to hire retired FBI agents
[15:17.320 --> 15:20.640]  But I mean that's what a real journalist would do notice media doesn't do that anymore
[15:20.640 --> 15:26.400]  They just see something somebody said and then they they just repeat what they heard. I mean
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.960]  When I come back, I'm gonna tell you this piece of news. I've got that I've seen the evidence and
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.040]  it's even from law enforcement and
[15:37.080 --> 15:40.200]  Everyone's afraid to bring it out even though they'll be heroes
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.720]  It's nothing. It's this timidness of everybody
[15:44.320 --> 15:47.880]  But so wait till you hear about what's going on when we come back
[15:47.880 --> 15:54.440]  I'm Alex Jones info wars.com news wars.com one way that dog hunt you share that link you share that link George Soros
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.880]  The future isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity
[16:04.840 --> 16:10.960]  Saving your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset in fact
[16:11.280 --> 16:13.280]  It's going to be your only asset
[16:13.840 --> 16:16.000]  The world being built by the technocrats
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.840]  And the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.480]  It's the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.680]  into total
[16:27.680 --> 16:29.680]  and complete dehumanization
[16:30.520 --> 16:37.400]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050
[16:37.920 --> 16:39.920]  This is their stated goal
[16:39.920 --> 16:46.760]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not
[16:46.920 --> 16:49.960]  Projecting your own decency onto the enemy. We turn this around
[16:50.520 --> 16:52.520]  You must study their own writings
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.840]  You must face the facts and you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed
[16:58.040 --> 17:02.080]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you
[17:02.760 --> 17:07.560]  We've confirmed from high-level sources in our own research that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election
[17:07.560 --> 17:12.200]  They're gonna really try to do it. They're that crazy. They intend to not just shut down in full force
[17:12.200 --> 17:15.560]  But have yours truly Alex Jones arrested and here's the really bad news
[17:15.760 --> 17:21.120]  They're coming after everybody and they're coming after the economy and they want to totally gut it and punish
[17:21.480 --> 17:26.880]  Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash, but here's the really good news
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.600]  The really good news humanity is awakening to this threat
[17:31.040 --> 17:35.960]  We're no longer asleep and we understand that the globalist are our mortal enemies
[17:35.960 --> 17:42.680]  And we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever
[17:43.080 --> 17:49.240]  That's why we must come together now as Americans every race color and creed and repudiate the New World Order and
[17:49.360 --> 17:51.880]  Stand firm and vote for Donald Trump
[17:51.880 --> 17:57.840]  But also the information war support independent media that tells the truth like info wars.com. Thank you
[17:57.840 --> 18:04.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:13.720 --> 18:16.960]  11 short days 90 days the inauguration
[18:18.040 --> 18:22.560]  11th of the nightmare of the chai comms the entire globalist forces
[18:23.280 --> 18:25.840]  launching the attempted takedown of our
[18:25.840 --> 18:31.920]  Sacred Republic. I don't have words to describe you how incredible this is. You don't need me to tell you
[18:31.920 --> 18:38.080]  You already know I don't have music that can build us up to the point of the incredible majesty of
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.200]  What God has in store for us and will just be faithful. I'm Alex Jones your host
[18:43.560 --> 18:49.400]  This is the live October 22nd Thursday transmission. This is the final countdown
[18:50.280 --> 18:52.280]  All right
[18:52.280 --> 18:55.880]  My biggest frustration is
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.720]  That we have a small media organization that reaches millions of people today and they can get in front of the present
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.600]  And as soon as I hire somebody and train them they get poached away to go work somewhere else, which is fine
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.600]  but it happens all the time and
[19:14.920 --> 19:16.920]  This morning I
[19:16.920 --> 19:25.520]  I learned from very credible sources something that I'd already gotten from another credible source last week and then I got so busy I
[19:26.240 --> 19:29.040]  Never follow up follow it up on so
[19:29.840 --> 19:32.640]  When I learned from the city of Austin source
[19:33.320 --> 19:35.080]  I'll leave it at that
[19:35.080 --> 19:36.680]  What was going on?
[19:36.680 --> 19:40.120]  It was like a kick in the stomach because I already knew about it
[19:40.120 --> 19:48.120]  And again, that's just an example of how rampant this is and and what am I talking about guys?
[19:48.120 --> 19:51.120]  Will you queue up the club out of Germantown, Maryland, please?
[19:51.880 --> 19:58.240]  With the man looking over his shoulder messing with the ballot and with a pin a marker changing it which is a crime
[19:58.240 --> 20:00.240]  I believe in that state
[20:00.240 --> 20:08.600]  But that's that speculation, I mean, maybe the guy's just stupid to know what he was doing
[20:10.040 --> 20:13.040]  This is a source known directly
[20:17.280 --> 20:26.120]  By individuals employed here that have worked in let's just say different stratisms the security apparatus of this country
[20:27.120 --> 20:28.320]  and
[20:28.320 --> 20:30.320]  all over Austin
[20:32.040 --> 20:34.880]  They are mailing into nursing homes
[20:37.840 --> 20:40.040]  Multiple ballots sometimes for a piece
[20:41.920 --> 20:43.920]  But of course not everybody's getting them
[20:44.840 --> 20:49.880]  Women are getting them and almost all of them are registered what?
[20:52.560 --> 20:54.400]  Democrats
[20:54.400 --> 21:00.600]  When I learned about this last week, I said, let me guess is it mainly women. Yeah, how do you know that and let me guess?
[21:00.600 --> 21:03.600]  They're Democrats. Yeah, they they yeah, yeah, they are
[21:04.600 --> 21:05.600]  and
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.360]  So I have a separate individual come here this morning
[21:11.320 --> 21:14.440]  And he's showing me the evidence of this but oh
[21:15.480 --> 21:22.480]  This person, you know works in the city of Austin. They don't want to get in trouble and I I get that but you're gonna get more trouble
[21:22.480 --> 21:25.840]  There's not a country. So I'm just like just get me copies of the ballots. Oh
[21:29.200 --> 21:34.520]  Touching somebody else's ballot, you know, that could be a crime. So so so they're mailing out everybody ballots
[21:34.920 --> 21:36.360]  They're mailing them in a nursing home
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.880]  People don't know what planet they're on most of them and the and the staff is filling them out getting paid off to do it
[21:40.880 --> 21:43.800]  Okay, and I mean it's open and shut it's going on
[21:45.840 --> 21:48.800]  So guarantee I call the FBI that it's gonna happen
[21:48.800 --> 21:53.280]  Because they won't let them the average FBI people are good, but those above are going to do anything
[21:54.160 --> 21:59.280]  And you know what? I'm still gonna call the FBI and so I told these folks. I said just go out
[21:59.520 --> 22:02.080]  I said, I don't care what you got to do
[22:02.400 --> 22:06.840]  Go over there and damn it. I mean, I'll sneak into the nursing home myself
[22:07.600 --> 22:09.120]  Do the interview
[22:09.120 --> 22:11.600]  But see we've got this passive attitude
[22:13.520 --> 22:15.520]  Or this isn't hearsay
[22:15.520 --> 22:21.600]  One individual has the damn ballots his mommy was given four of them and they're saying yeah, the rest of the women got them
[22:22.480 --> 22:24.480]  And folks to the nursing home
[22:28.320 --> 22:29.920]  God help us
[22:29.920 --> 22:35.520]  And can you imagine when that comes back to the state of Texas imagine about it is in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Florida?
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.520]  It's going to be totally
[22:37.920 --> 22:39.440]  a jackknife
[22:39.440 --> 22:41.040]  Snurl of
[22:41.040 --> 22:44.240]  of entanglement and impossible to find out
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.080]  what's going on and it states like Texas it'll be hard to
[22:50.160 --> 22:52.800]  Get fake ballots through but the stumbles still make it
[22:53.680 --> 22:55.680]  But what's going to happen in other states?
[22:56.800 --> 22:58.800]  Well, we know what's going to happen
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.120]  and that's why
[23:01.120 --> 23:08.400]  The Democrats in the last year quietly tried to get the Pentagon to say they'd overthrow Trump if they can test the election the Pentagon said no
[23:08.400 --> 23:10.400]  Hell no
[23:10.400 --> 23:14.880]  So they moved about a month ago to say okay, Biden's going to win by a landslide remember before
[23:14.880 --> 23:18.720]  Oh, they got caught with fake polls four years ago, so they weren't doing it as bad this time
[23:18.720 --> 23:23.680]  But now right back to fake polls. He's going to win a landslide and they're just going to say he won and they're going to go with
[23:23.680 --> 23:26.800]  This the session movement and have the media declare Biden the winner
[23:26.800 --> 23:31.920]  They'll say oh, it's not clear the night. Oh take a week or two and then they're going to say Biden wins and then
[23:31.920 --> 23:38.400]  When Trump can test it they're going to say he's a liar and this is a disaster by design and during that
[23:38.400 --> 23:42.320]  And during that they're going to plunge the stock market saying uncertainty about America
[23:42.880 --> 23:51.200]  Trump won't step down stock market down 5,000 points 7,000 points 10,000 points 12,000 points 14,000 points
[23:51.920 --> 23:57.520]  20,000 points and and it's going to be everybody lined up saying get rid of Trump and
[23:58.640 --> 24:01.040]  Biden will turn to the stock market back on
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.280]  And they're going to betray us during that period and then they're going to kill the dollar and then
[24:07.280 --> 24:10.880]  The average leftist won't remember they did this a month later. They have no memory
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.360]  They won't care that their pension shot. They won't care everything's bankrupt
[24:15.440 --> 24:19.040]  They won't care there's war on the streets. They won't care that they'll be venezuela like that
[24:19.440 --> 24:26.640]  You'll be cuba like that because that's the thing about leftist. They have a spirit of evil a spirit of denial a spirit of being morons
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.520]  Yeah shock poll texas tide
[24:33.520 --> 24:42.160]  Mega rips debate moderator trump ways firing fbi director and bar. Well, I mean, they're not doing their job
[24:42.240 --> 24:44.240]  He had the laptop under biden
[24:44.800 --> 24:51.440]  Releases full 60 minutes interview. He walks out of tough questions. No, he doesn't sure they got in 45 minutes twitter account hacked
[24:51.920 --> 24:55.280]  994 covet deaths today. Yeah, they're counting all the
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.600]  Flues and all the demolius. You always had that many deaths, but oh, they're gonna talk about it all day and
[25:01.600 --> 25:04.800]  Discuss it because they're trying to steal texas folks
[25:08.400 --> 25:14.960]  That's how much trouble we're in because we have a criminal organized crime group trying to take over the country
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.040]  And then that means the whole planet
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.920]  And that's why we've got to be praying for a global awakening and we've got to get trump back yet
[25:21.920 --> 25:25.440]  And then he's got to go on the offense and let me tell you he's out there not wearing a mask
[25:25.680 --> 25:27.680]  He's saying covet's overblown now
[25:27.920 --> 25:30.960]  He's saying arrest the deep state. He's saying go after the new world order
[25:30.960 --> 25:32.560]  He is
[25:32.560 --> 25:38.480]  Taking the vaccine program away from bill gates, which I told you would piss gates off because gates want you to have that mRNA
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.600]  What she just says he has the vaccine that ends the fear of the nobody will take the vaccine trump knows what he's doing
[25:45.040 --> 25:50.160]  It's actually working. I'm not defending his machiavelli tactics. I'm not for inoculation because I know they tame him
[25:50.160 --> 25:52.160]  I'm saying I trump knows what he's doing
[25:52.400 --> 25:54.880]  He's doing a different strategy than I would but more and more
[25:55.360 --> 25:58.800]  He's been 90 percent of my strategy. He's like 98 percent of the strategy
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.160]  I'd go with that's just the truth guns are blazing out in the open
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.800]  Just like I released the segments of the interview with meghan kelly before she did to show that she was lying
[26:09.200 --> 26:15.040]  Trump just did that with 60 minutes so you can see how they jump cut how they edit what he really said
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.280]  So the so the good news is out of this the system is being destroyed. It's corrupt. It's unamerican. It's out of control
[26:21.600 --> 26:25.280]  Will trump survive it will info or survive it will some of you survive it? Maybe not
[26:25.280 --> 26:30.240]  But at least we're fighting back now and that's the good news now that we're awake now that we're fighting back
[26:30.800 --> 26:37.680]  The enemy just threw everything it's got at us the whole world the chai comms trillions of dollars and they're losing right now
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.240]  You got that so
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.800]  This fight's just going to go on and on and we're going to take the globalist out. We've got obama
[26:46.160 --> 26:48.240]  criticizing the president in a disgusting way
[26:48.240 --> 26:56.480]  And and laughing like he's in junior high like that fools us that there is no conspiracy. There's no powerful group because they fear of that exposure
[26:57.120 --> 27:00.160]  vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now
[27:00.880 --> 27:03.040]  Back in stock it's being sold out for months
[27:03.200 --> 27:07.680]  They're sold out because people know that high quality b12 and a good mix of vitamins minerals
[27:07.760 --> 27:13.360]  Especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your immune system
[27:13.360 --> 27:19.440]  Well, both products are back in stock at info or store comms two weeks after the election
[27:19.680 --> 27:22.480]  And we're offering them both at 50% off
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.000]  Free shipping and triple patriot points to your next order
[27:26.400 --> 27:32.320]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping an additional 10% off that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders
[27:32.480 --> 27:35.600]  Now we have had a big clearance sale going so a lot of stuff sold out
[27:35.840 --> 27:37.520]  A lot of the other stuff is close to selling out
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.680]  But some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually come back into stock
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.960]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.360]  So those should be back in stock as well soon. Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the year
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.280]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight and you've helped win the war against the global so far
[27:57.200 --> 28:04.640]  Finally the stagnant republican establishment understands what info wars understands what our listeners understand
[28:04.880 --> 28:06.880]  What donald trump understands
[28:06.880 --> 28:14.160]  We're in a digital civil war. There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.000]  On every major tech platform and now they're doing it to the
[28:18.800 --> 28:22.400]  Private apps they're doing it to text messages. They're doing it to email
[28:22.640 --> 28:25.840]  This is mafia organized crime election meddling
[28:26.160 --> 28:30.880]  But finally when they blocked the hunter biden and the barisma information
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.880]  And the chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.720]  Biden hasn't denied it
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.520]  Finally congress got pissed and said this is out of control. You've got to stop it now. We're taking action
[28:43.680 --> 28:47.280]  Oh inject worse. You went. Oh, it's a mistake. It's an accident. It's an accident
[28:47.360 --> 28:50.720]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.040]  Well info wars is calling their bluff and i want to thank you all for keeping us on the air
[28:55.040 --> 29:03.440]  2020 election center dot com just type it at one time. You've got to save right there in your browser and then

[29:27.280 --> 29:33.520]  Is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago trump has finally figured this out
[29:33.680 --> 29:38.160]  Since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech i mean he's modern situation
[29:38.320 --> 29:39.920]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now
[29:39.920 --> 29:42.480]  So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action
[29:42.800 --> 29:48.080]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very very easily by sharing 2020 election center dot com

[30:02.080 --> 30:04.080]  So
[30:16.640 --> 30:18.800]  My eyes are blind but i can see
[30:23.200 --> 30:27.200]  My eyes are blind but i can see
[30:27.200 --> 30:29.200]  I
[30:36.880 --> 30:38.880]  The sun no longer sets me free
[30:38.880 --> 30:43.920]  The sun no longer sets me free
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.000]  I feel no place missing me
[30:54.400 --> 30:56.400]  Well then turn back to god
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.120]  Sun will set you free
[30:59.920 --> 31:01.920]  So will the night
[31:02.080 --> 31:04.080]  It's all made by god
[31:04.080 --> 31:11.200]  And cultists actually fear the night for the claim they are the night
[31:12.880 --> 31:14.880]  Fear the darkness
[31:15.760 --> 31:21.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide. Let me hit some good news. I'll get the really big news
[31:23.680 --> 31:27.600]  You've had state courts and federal courts all over the united states say
[31:27.600 --> 31:31.760]  Congress shall make no law establishing
[31:34.480 --> 31:36.480]  Religion
[31:36.960 --> 31:42.720]  The establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof congress shall make no law
[31:45.840 --> 31:47.840]  Congress shall make no law
[31:48.400 --> 31:50.400]  Concerning the establishment of religion
[31:52.080 --> 31:54.080]  Or the free exercise thereof
[31:54.080 --> 31:57.040]  Don't have a jurisdiction
[31:58.400 --> 32:00.400]  Don't have it
[32:00.800 --> 32:05.920]  That means it's not your rodeo not your property not your zone not your area
[32:07.360 --> 32:09.360]  Not your lane
[32:09.360 --> 32:13.360]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[32:13.360 --> 32:15.360]  Or the right of the press
[32:16.480 --> 32:20.480]  Or the right of the people to peacefully assemble for a redress of their grievances
[32:20.480 --> 32:22.480]  That's the first amendment
[32:23.200 --> 32:26.480]  And it's under total globalist assault right now
[32:34.480 --> 32:36.480]  But you see what's happening
[32:37.600 --> 32:40.160]  Federal court just ruled that churches
[32:41.360 --> 32:43.360]  Cannot be forced to wear masks
[32:44.800 --> 32:46.800]  And that they cannot do social distancing
[32:46.800 --> 32:50.080]  and that they cannot do social distancing.
[32:50.080 --> 32:53.360]  But the problem is the churches themselves
[32:53.360 --> 32:56.580]  will self enforce it because the media always says,
[32:56.580 --> 32:59.920]  according to the WHO, according to the UN,
[32:59.920 --> 33:02.560]  and the corporations are the new government.
[33:02.560 --> 33:04.980]  And big tech is the new enforcer.
[33:04.980 --> 33:08.480]  And that's why they're making their move is they believe
[33:08.480 --> 33:11.720]  they can supersede Congress and your local governments
[33:11.720 --> 33:13.620]  because they've already bought off most of Congress.
[33:13.620 --> 33:15.560]  They've already bought off most of the cities.
[33:15.560 --> 33:16.760]  They've already got control.
[33:16.760 --> 33:19.880]  And that's why it's up to we, the people,
[33:21.200 --> 33:24.360]  united can never be defeated.
[33:26.640 --> 33:28.800]  But it comes to us in non-compliance.
[33:28.800 --> 33:30.840]  Oh, Alex, just wear the mask.
[33:30.840 --> 33:32.400]  You know, it'll be over soon.
[33:32.400 --> 33:33.640]  It'll never be over.
[33:33.640 --> 33:35.440]  Bill Gates now says 10 years
[33:36.320 --> 33:38.280]  because the mask is a symbol of idiocy.
[33:38.280 --> 33:39.360]  Big studies have come out.
[33:39.360 --> 33:40.240]  They're trying to suppress it.
[33:40.240 --> 33:46.480]  The mask actually spread disease. It's all crap,
[33:46.480 --> 33:51.480]  ladies and gentlemen. It's all total and complete bunk.
[33:54.320 --> 33:56.640]  Doctors wear masks because they don't want to smell
[33:56.640 --> 33:59.000]  your blood and the pus coming out of your teeth
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.240]  when they're drilling them.
[34:02.920 --> 34:07.920]  Doctors wear gas-operated spacesuits now
[34:07.920 --> 34:10.120]  with oxygen pumped in because when they're removing
[34:10.120 --> 34:12.920]  those mercury fillings, they don't want to breathe it.
[34:14.200 --> 34:16.920]  Not because they're worried about keeping you safe.
[34:19.480 --> 34:22.320]  The M95 masks protect those wearing it,
[34:23.320 --> 34:24.920]  but not those outside of it.
[34:25.840 --> 34:27.560]  But these are facts.
[34:27.560 --> 34:29.920]  The simpletons want to just wear their mask
[34:29.920 --> 34:32.600]  and feel like they're this good person, like,
[34:32.600 --> 34:34.600]  oh, I've got my app on my phone.
[34:34.600 --> 34:37.320]  All the major restaurants now, even small ones,
[34:37.320 --> 34:40.440]  you go in them and, oh, we don't have menus anymore.
[34:40.440 --> 34:42.520]  You scan right here. You got to have a phone.
[34:43.440 --> 34:44.520]  Oh, I don't have my phone.
[34:44.520 --> 34:47.960]  Oh, I'm sorry. You can't get food.
[34:47.960 --> 34:49.440]  And that's getting you ready to scan.
[34:49.440 --> 34:51.480]  And if you hadn't paid your taxes,
[34:51.480 --> 34:53.560]  if you don't have a good social credit score,
[34:53.560 --> 34:56.000]  they're not letting you in the building.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.480]  That's the admitted plan.
[34:57.480 --> 34:59.200]  And you can tell the owner of the restaurant that
[34:59.200 --> 35:00.120]  they don't care.
[35:00.120 --> 35:02.960]  They get some corporate email that tells them
[35:02.960 --> 35:04.960]  how to make money and who to sign up with
[35:04.960 --> 35:06.960]  and what they should do to be a good citizen.
[35:06.960 --> 35:09.080]  And every liberal restaurant has it.
[35:09.080 --> 35:10.920]  Every conservative restaurant doesn't.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.680]  The left adopts whatever they're told their occult.
[35:15.680 --> 35:17.880]  Here's a clip of a local newscast
[35:17.880 --> 35:20.880]  on federal court striking down
[35:20.880 --> 35:23.080]  the unconstitutional mask mandates.
[35:24.200 --> 35:25.640]  And a big talker this morning,
[35:25.640 --> 35:28.200]  and one of our top stories on CBSDembar.com
[35:28.200 --> 35:31.800]  is the win in federal court by two churches here in Colorado.
[35:31.800 --> 35:34.880]  The court case allows congregations to no longer wear masks
[35:34.880 --> 35:37.720]  or limit the number of people under one roof.
[35:37.720 --> 35:40.400]  The pastors of Colorado Church's Denver Bible Church
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.760]  and Community Baptist Church filed a lawsuit in August,
[35:43.760 --> 35:45.720]  saying the restrictions were violations
[35:45.720 --> 35:48.240]  of the right to free exercise of religion.
[35:48.240 --> 35:50.000]  The federal judge made the decision
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.720]  in agreeance last Thursday.
[35:51.720 --> 35:54.520]  However, the state says it plans to appeal the decision
[35:54.520 --> 35:56.640]  to overrule state health orders.
[35:57.720 --> 35:59.360]  But notice, they don't care about Black Lives Matter
[35:59.360 --> 36:01.600]  shooting people on the head or huge rallies.
[36:01.600 --> 36:05.880]  They want churches to stay shut and gyms and restaurants,
[36:05.880 --> 36:09.240]  producers, they want you to come to them
[36:09.240 --> 36:10.880]  to be able to have a life.
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.120]  Now, let's break it down.
[36:18.600 --> 36:21.880]  Oh, all the restaurants are going digital to stop COVID
[36:21.880 --> 36:24.440]  because we're dirty and menus are bad
[36:24.440 --> 36:27.400]  and oh, robots wash our plates.
[36:27.400 --> 36:29.040]  Oh, other humans are evil.
[36:29.040 --> 36:31.280]  That's how you depopulate.
[36:31.280 --> 36:33.520]  You teach folks that any human action's bad.
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.360]  You teach folks that no one can ever get sick
[36:35.360 --> 36:36.320]  and no one can ever die
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.280]  because it's an impossible problem that can never be fixed.
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.400]  Bill Gates says, you'll never fix the problem,
[36:43.400 --> 36:44.960]  you'll never go back to normal.
[36:44.960 --> 36:47.440]  I'm gonna run your life because we're teaching you
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.040]  to have a hysteria about regular flu, regular cold,
[36:51.040 --> 36:53.360]  we're at regular pneumonia death
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.000]  because the tests are geared to shut down anybody
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.200]  that has a positive test.
[36:59.200 --> 37:01.880]  Joe Rogan's had to shut down because his producer
[37:01.880 --> 37:04.640]  is supposed to get COVID, isn't even sick.
[37:04.640 --> 37:06.080]  But oh, we've got to shut down
[37:06.080 --> 37:09.240]  because the insurance company says, we just have to go away.
[37:11.680 --> 37:13.600]  Talk about the WIMP culture.
[37:13.600 --> 37:14.960]  I'm not saying Joe's a WIMP,
[37:14.960 --> 37:17.280]  but I mean, this is the nanny state now you see.
[37:17.280 --> 37:18.960]  Oh, you can't have a cold.
[37:18.960 --> 37:21.240]  Oh, but never tells you you need zinc.
[37:21.240 --> 37:23.640]  Never tells you you need vitamin D3.
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.200]  Never tells you you need C.
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.320]  Never tells you that if you have a large dose of that
[37:30.320 --> 37:31.320]  and you're absorbing it,
[37:31.320 --> 37:35.120]  that you're basically invincible from viruses.
[37:35.120 --> 37:36.720]  You may still get a heart attack.
[37:36.720 --> 37:38.000]  You may still have a stroke.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.480]  You may still get struck by lightning.
[37:39.480 --> 37:40.840]  You may still be in a car wreck.
[37:40.840 --> 37:43.280]  You may still get cancer, but not as often,
[37:43.280 --> 37:46.680]  but you basically can't get viral infections
[37:46.680 --> 37:49.280]  when you're loaded up with 13 vitamins and minerals.
[37:51.600 --> 37:53.160]  And that's a damn fact.
[37:53.160 --> 37:54.320]  That's problem solved.
[37:54.320 --> 37:56.440]  Oh, don't tell anybody that.
[37:56.440 --> 37:59.800]  Oh, you need $3,000 in Dezevir.
[37:59.800 --> 38:03.040]  That Bill Gates and Fauci own part of.
[38:03.040 --> 38:06.120]  All right, I need to hit the laptop news.
[38:06.120 --> 38:07.560]  I need to give the number out and take calls.
[38:07.560 --> 38:09.000]  I need to hit all these clips.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.120]  And I said I'd play something when we came back
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.160]  that was huge, but I'm out of time right now.
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.120]  This Obama thing coming out and saying, man, Trump's crazy.
[38:20.120 --> 38:22.360]  He believes in a secret power group.
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.160]  We're under you in control of our health.
[38:25.160 --> 38:27.080]  Medical doctors that own hospitals
[38:27.080 --> 38:28.680]  can't have YouTube channels,
[38:28.680 --> 38:31.360]  saying they gave steroids to their patients and cured them.
[38:33.200 --> 38:34.040]  Wow.
[38:34.040 --> 38:36.040]  I also saw him doing a speech yesterday with a mask on.
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.320]  He was like, bang, fire goes up.
[38:39.320 --> 38:40.480]  That's all coming up.
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.040]  This is a big deal, though.
[38:43.040 --> 38:44.400]  I'll explain why when we come back.
[38:44.400 --> 38:46.360]  I'll give the number up.
[38:46.360 --> 38:51.480]  Separately, this is a new massive week of specials
[38:51.480 --> 38:53.080]  at PrepareWithAlex.com.

[39:05.680 --> 39:07.240]  And they got rid of the other cells
[39:07.240 --> 39:08.280]  as they couldn't do that anymore.
[39:08.280 --> 39:09.440]  It's already the lowest price.

[39:55.800 --> 39:58.800]  ["Band Dot Video"]

[40:49.640 --> 40:52.640]  ["Black Friday"]
[40:55.720 --> 40:58.080]  Black Friday in October.
[40:58.080 --> 41:00.560]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales
[41:00.560 --> 41:03.680]  that we ran in the last couple weeks of October.
[41:03.680 --> 41:04.960]  It was popular for a reason.
[41:04.960 --> 41:08.640]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday

[41:52.160 --> 41:53.800]  Infowarstore.com.
[41:53.800 --> 41:55.400]  Black Friday comes in October.
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.680]  A major life lesson just took place last night.
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.280]  The top story in the country was that
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.000]  Hunter Biden's laptop information had come out.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.600]  Him with hookers and shooting porno movies
[42:10.600 --> 42:13.160]  and crack pipes with the real news
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.560]  was how he had indeed been bought off by Barisma
[42:16.560 --> 42:18.760]  and had done so at the behest of his father
[42:18.760 --> 42:21.440]  who was getting large parts of the money.
[42:21.440 --> 42:23.720]  But you see, Twitter and Facebook and others
[42:23.720 --> 42:25.440]  totally censored the info
[42:25.440 --> 42:27.640]  and even censored major news publications
[42:27.640 --> 42:29.240]  and even censored the president.
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.560]  But when the president and Congress
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.640]  said they were gonna take action,
[42:31.640 --> 42:35.440]  suddenly Jack of Twitter said he didn't know
[42:35.440 --> 42:37.080]  what had happened and it was wrong.
[42:37.080 --> 42:38.720]  And that's the big life lesson here.
[42:38.720 --> 42:41.680]  Standing up and saying no to organized crime,
[42:41.680 --> 42:44.520]  rapid caring is the way to stop it.
[42:44.520 --> 42:47.000]  Grobbling to it and letting big tech lie to us
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.440]  and run over us is the way to make these tyrants
[42:49.440 --> 42:51.320]  continue to go absolutely crazy.
[42:51.320 --> 42:54.400]  Remember, they support communist China and its death camps.
[42:54.400 --> 42:55.440]  What will they do to us?
[42:55.440 --> 42:56.440]  Will we now know?
[42:57.600 --> 43:00.840]  COVID rollout has been extremely well planned,
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.200]  very well thought out and has been incrementally orchestrated.
[43:04.200 --> 43:06.600]  First, it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty.
[43:06.600 --> 43:07.440]  That's all right.
[43:07.440 --> 43:09.840]  It's two months and it's six months and it's a year.
[43:09.840 --> 43:12.040]  Now Bill Gates says 10 years.
[43:12.040 --> 43:13.960]  And people are not saying, I like my mask.
[43:13.960 --> 43:15.520]  I like my face diaper.
[43:15.520 --> 43:17.320]  I like my being key.
[43:17.320 --> 43:19.280]  And so getting into the fear,
[43:19.280 --> 43:20.320]  getting into the hysteria,
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.160]  getting into all the exaggerated death numbers.
[43:24.160 --> 43:28.120]  This is our new neurotic control freak society
[43:28.120 --> 43:31.840]  overseen by robots, overseen by AI.
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.720]  And all of it is designed to make humans not essential.
[43:36.720 --> 43:38.680]  That's why out of the gates, they tell us,
[43:38.680 --> 43:40.680]  you are not essential.
[43:40.680 --> 43:42.720]  You are not essential.
[43:42.720 --> 43:46.640]  Your company, your restaurant, your job,
[43:46.640 --> 43:48.400]  your profession is not essential.
[43:48.400 --> 43:51.960]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated
[43:51.960 --> 43:54.040]  and Bill Gates sits on top of it.
[43:54.040 --> 43:55.640]  Come on, folks, let's reject this.
[43:55.640 --> 44:02.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:26.640 --> 44:29.120]  You know, I have mixed feelings about this going down.
[44:29.120 --> 44:32.240]  I'm so proud to see humans across the planet
[44:32.240 --> 44:35.000]  of early race color and creeds who are one race human
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.640]  come together in the huge away fitting
[44:36.640 --> 44:38.320]  that good and evil are real.
[44:38.320 --> 44:39.960]  That's what this battle is about.
[44:39.960 --> 44:42.080]  But knowing how bad evil is,
[44:42.080 --> 44:44.160]  I can't believe it's almost winning.
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.400]  I mean, it's just horrifying
[44:48.840 --> 44:50.200]  what the globalists have already done
[44:50.200 --> 44:52.000]  to third world countries, what they've done to us,
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.800]  what they do to those they get control of.
[44:54.800 --> 44:56.240]  They're just monsters.
[44:57.920 --> 45:01.200]  Remember, Obama was at West Point about five years ago.
[45:02.840 --> 45:04.200]  I played the clip many times.
[45:05.280 --> 45:07.640]  He says, don't listen to those that claim tyranny
[45:07.640 --> 45:10.080]  is always around the corner and there's danger
[45:10.080 --> 45:11.720]  and there's oppressive systems
[45:11.720 --> 45:13.640]  and people that want to take their rights.
[45:14.600 --> 45:15.680]  This is not true.
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.760]  There is no new world order.
[45:18.760 --> 45:19.600]  Remember that?
[45:21.360 --> 45:22.760]  Even though he's part of the same project
[45:22.760 --> 45:24.160]  that calls for a new world order
[45:24.160 --> 45:25.640]  under Herbert Walker Bush.
[45:26.840 --> 45:28.760]  Well, he came out, as you know,
[45:28.760 --> 45:31.280]  in his speech that they're billing destroyed Trump,
[45:31.280 --> 45:34.720]  you know, all the CNN hype, to a little tiny crowd.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.680]  The first he had his mask on and finally just pulled it off.
[45:38.680 --> 45:40.560]  He's like, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[45:40.560 --> 45:42.760]  he kept messing with the mask and finally pulled it off.
[45:42.760 --> 45:44.600]  I mean, just no one can do this.
[45:44.600 --> 45:45.840]  It's a joke.
[45:45.840 --> 45:47.120]  They're smothering us.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  And so that's the image him pulling that mask off.
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.160]  He slams Trump from believing secret cabal runs the world.
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.960]  I mean, we just saw Bill Gates
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.080]  over every major African country except Tanzania,
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.160]  over the US, over Canada, over Mexico.
[46:07.160 --> 46:08.960]  Even though Bolsonaro's president
[46:08.960 --> 46:13.160]  Gates through his system controls their medical system
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.560]  because they did the grants and the funding
[46:14.560 --> 46:16.320]  over the last 30 years.
[46:16.320 --> 46:17.440]  Europe's under it.
[46:17.440 --> 46:19.440]  The UN gives the orders.
[46:19.440 --> 46:23.360]  If the UN says you don't need vitamin D3,
[46:23.360 --> 46:25.720]  if a doctor tries to prescribe it, they get arrested.
[46:25.720 --> 46:27.160]  Vitamin C, you get arrested.
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.840]  Seriously, doctors saying, hey, here's vitamin D and C.
[46:29.840 --> 46:30.680]  Take this.
[46:30.680 --> 46:32.360]  Boom, arrested SWAT team FBI.
[46:32.360 --> 46:33.560]  People go, well, the FBI's here.
[46:33.560 --> 46:34.960]  I mean, it must be bad what they did.
[46:34.960 --> 46:37.160]  It's like, you gave that baby mother's milk.
[46:37.160 --> 46:39.600]  Why, you put a plant in the sun, you're arrested.
[46:40.920 --> 46:42.240]  Why, you didn't run that red light.
[46:42.240 --> 46:43.080]  We're arresting you.
[46:43.080 --> 46:45.520]  Why, why, why, why, you helped a little old lady
[46:45.520 --> 46:46.360]  across the street.
[46:46.360 --> 46:48.200]  We're gonna, but again, they do it like,
[46:48.200 --> 46:49.680]  oh, the FBI's here.
[46:49.680 --> 46:53.280]  I mean, I mean, the doctor is giving a vitamin C.
[46:53.280 --> 46:54.160]  I mean, we have to.
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.360]  And so we're under United Nations control
[46:59.360 --> 47:02.040]  telling us exactly what we can do, when we can do,
[47:02.040 --> 47:03.480]  how we can do it.
[47:03.480 --> 47:04.720]  And it's all centralized.
[47:04.720 --> 47:06.240]  And Bill Gates on TV going,
[47:06.240 --> 47:07.440]  I don't care what Trump says.
[47:07.440 --> 47:08.760]  You're gonna take five shots a year
[47:08.760 --> 47:10.840]  and the masks don't come off for 10 years.
[47:10.840 --> 47:13.400]  And the media goes, okay, they don't come off for 10 years.
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.000]  People go, who died and made this guy emperor of the planet?
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.960]  I mean, imagine if an alien sat down
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.720]  on a little pink cushion and said,
[47:20.720 --> 47:22.320]  I am Gork from Mars.
[47:22.320 --> 47:23.840]  I am your emperor.
[47:23.840 --> 47:26.240]  If you don't do as I say, I'll blow your planet up.
[47:28.160 --> 47:28.840]  Well, there's Bill Gates.
[47:28.840 --> 47:31.400]  You can never go back to normal until you take all my shots,
[47:31.400 --> 47:33.960]  have trackers on your phones and always wear masks.
[47:33.960 --> 47:34.880]  And then a year later,
[47:34.880 --> 47:37.840]  actually you'll take the shots and have the trackers,
[47:37.840 --> 47:39.720]  but you'll still never have freedom
[47:39.720 --> 47:41.160]  because we're trying to save the earth
[47:41.160 --> 47:44.280]  from your carbon footprint and we're gonna make you poor.
[47:44.280 --> 47:48.760]  So then they can make us do what they say socially for food
[47:48.760 --> 47:51.040]  because now everything's gonna be automated.
[47:51.040 --> 47:54.000]  See, automation and robots doesn't mean
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  you work two days a week.
[47:55.000 --> 47:55.920]  It means you die.
[47:57.360 --> 48:00.080]  Oh, the year 2020 or year 2030.
[48:00.080 --> 48:02.120]  Well, automation will be so great with robots.
[48:02.120 --> 48:04.760]  We'll work two days a week and do art and literature
[48:04.760 --> 48:06.680]  and just get smarter.
[48:06.680 --> 48:09.120]  But instead we work more hours and have less
[48:09.120 --> 48:10.800]  and everything's falling apart and everything,
[48:10.800 --> 48:15.800]  nothing works right, planned obsolescence in humanity
[48:16.120 --> 48:18.880]  and it's all admitted to be their official plan.
[48:21.080 --> 48:22.920]  And they write books how they're doing it.
[48:22.920 --> 48:24.440]  And they've got all these movies.
[48:24.440 --> 48:26.000]  There's a new movie out every time I turn around,
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.400]  I'll read the spoiler on a science fiction movie.
[48:30.400 --> 48:33.520]  I used to like science fiction until every movie is,
[48:33.520 --> 48:35.760]  the earth was overpopulated, everyone ties.
[48:35.760 --> 48:38.280]  But thanks to depopulation in a new system,
[48:38.280 --> 48:40.120]  humans merged with machines
[48:40.120 --> 48:42.320]  and now they're able to live into the future forever.
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.640]  You know, used to it was I a robot,
[48:44.640 --> 48:46.280]  the robots can become a problem.
[48:47.680 --> 48:49.040]  But oh, no, no, not now.
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.960]  All the new movies is, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[48:51.960 --> 48:53.840]  We become robots and live forever.
[48:55.720 --> 48:57.400]  What a dystopic nightmare.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.200]  And so they're telling you all this,
[49:01.200 --> 49:03.120]  these godless big tech executives
[49:03.120 --> 49:04.560]  that are bigger than government,
[49:04.560 --> 49:06.560]  engaging all these crimes against you.
[49:06.560 --> 49:11.560]  But again, the delusional conservatives,
[49:13.680 --> 49:16.520]  the delusional lawyers that still think
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.080]  cause they're in the big ivory capital building
[49:20.080 --> 49:22.800]  that they're in control, you're in control of nothing
[49:22.800 --> 49:24.520]  because you handed your power over
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.280]  to the new world order dumbasses.
[49:27.480 --> 49:29.720]  And I'm saying, if you wanna get the Senate
[49:29.720 --> 49:30.720]  and the house to do something,
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.120]  want your governor to do something,
[49:32.120 --> 49:33.920]  don't call up and bitch at him and say,
[49:33.920 --> 49:35.840]  oh, you're a tyrant, you're taking us over.
[49:35.840 --> 49:37.160]  They like that.
[49:37.160 --> 49:39.400]  Say, you're a schmuck, you're an idiot,
[49:39.400 --> 49:41.840]  you've been taken over by a multinational powerhouse,
[49:41.840 --> 49:44.040]  you're run by China, you're run by big tech,
[49:44.040 --> 49:46.920]  you're a bitch, cause they are.
[49:50.880 --> 49:52.000]  That's who they are.
[49:53.560 --> 49:56.040]  So let's go to this clip of Obama.
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.120]  And what is Obama really telling you here in this clip?
[49:59.120 --> 50:01.400]  He's saying, don't talk about the international
[50:01.400 --> 50:03.720]  power structure, don't talk about the big banks,
[50:03.720 --> 50:04.920]  don't talk about the new world order,
[50:04.920 --> 50:07.200]  don't talk about the WTO, don't talk about the IMF,
[50:07.200 --> 50:08.200]  don't talk about the World Bank,
[50:08.200 --> 50:11.240]  don't talk about globalism, don't talk about the UN
[50:11.240 --> 50:13.320]  because globalism is the global government
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.000]  and it's authoritarian and it's bad.
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.800]  And if we ever have a debate about it and say,
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.040]  it's authoritarian, it's bad, it's out of control, it's done.
[50:20.040 --> 50:21.760]  They wanna just bring in globalism,
[50:21.760 --> 50:24.520]  have you accept a world ID on your iPhone,
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.880]  a face scan that controls everything you do
[50:26.880 --> 50:29.200]  and taxes your movements and runs your life
[50:29.200 --> 50:32.440]  and makes you poor all under the COVID rollout.
[50:32.440 --> 50:35.040]  This is them rolling their takeover out.
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.480]  And so Obama makes jokes when we see rigged debates,
[50:39.480 --> 50:43.440]  rigged polls, all big tech blocking Hunter Biden's
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.440]  real emails now confirmed, confirmed sex abuse of children,
[50:48.880 --> 50:51.240]  emails to his dad and the media is more than happy
[50:51.240 --> 50:54.000]  as spokesperson, as PR firms to cover that up.
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.880]  So, oh, there's no centralized group.
[51:01.880 --> 51:02.880]  There's no secret group.
[51:02.880 --> 51:05.200]  You're right, it's not secret, it's out of the open.
[51:05.200 --> 51:09.040]  So, here's Obama, laughing and ridiculing what he fears.
[51:09.040 --> 51:10.160]  Like, ha, ha, ha.
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.120]  And then they claim the sun comes up the morning.
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.080]  Ha, ha, ha.
[51:13.080 --> 51:15.240]  Next, they said the ocean's got water in it.
[51:15.240 --> 51:16.240]  Ha, ha, ha.
[51:16.240 --> 51:17.840]  Next, they said the grass was green.
[51:17.840 --> 51:18.680]  Let me tell you another one.
[51:18.680 --> 51:19.840]  Ha, ha, ha.
[51:19.840 --> 51:23.080]  Next, he told me that roosters go cock-a-doodle-doo
[51:23.080 --> 51:24.840]  and then they get even worse.
[51:24.840 --> 51:29.160]  He told me, he told me the really funny thing
[51:29.160 --> 51:31.680]  is that the sky is blue.
[51:33.520 --> 51:34.960]  Yeah.
[51:34.960 --> 51:36.280]  Yeah.
[51:36.280 --> 51:39.640]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[51:39.640 --> 51:40.960]  He said vaccines are dangerous
[51:40.960 --> 51:42.400]  so much people are dying in the trials.
[51:42.400 --> 51:43.240]  He's right.
[51:43.240 --> 51:46.960]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[51:46.960 --> 51:49.280]  Here's Obama not looking too good.
[51:49.280 --> 51:50.880]  Looks like Big Mike might have gave him age.
[51:50.880 --> 51:51.720]  Here it is.
[51:53.200 --> 51:55.720]  And with Joe and Kamala at the helm,
[51:55.720 --> 51:59.040]  you're not gonna have to think about the crazy things
[51:59.040 --> 52:00.560]  they said every day.
[52:01.800 --> 52:03.360]  And that's worth a lot.
[52:04.840 --> 52:08.320]  You're not gonna have to argue about them every day.
[52:11.200 --> 52:13.720]  It just won't be so exhausting.
[52:13.720 --> 52:16.120]  You might be able to have a Thanksgiving dinner
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.440]  without having an argument.
[52:19.320 --> 52:21.680]  You'll be able to go about your lives
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.600]  knowing that the president is not gonna
[52:23.600 --> 52:25.800]  retweet conspiracy theories
[52:25.800 --> 52:29.720]  about secret cabals running the world
[52:29.720 --> 52:33.880]  or that Navy SEALs didn't actually kill bin Laden.
[52:34.760 --> 52:36.480]  Think about that.
[52:36.480 --> 52:39.120]  The president of the United States retweeted that.
[52:39.120 --> 52:40.560]  They didn't.
[52:40.560 --> 52:41.480]  Imagine.
[52:42.920 --> 52:44.160]  Imagine.
[52:44.160 --> 52:45.080]  What?
[52:45.080 --> 52:45.920]  What?
[52:45.920 --> 52:49.360]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[52:49.360 --> 52:50.960]  We're not gonna have a president
[52:50.960 --> 52:54.160]  that goes out of his way to insult anybody
[52:54.160 --> 52:58.640]  who doesn't support him or threaten them with jail.
[52:58.640 --> 53:01.240]  That's not normal presidential behavior.
[53:01.240 --> 53:02.760]  And listen how he's.
[53:02.760 --> 53:04.400]  It's not normal to sell us out to China.
[53:04.400 --> 53:09.400]  It's not normal to call your wife Michael over and over again.
[53:11.400 --> 53:12.240]  We're gonna go to break.
[53:12.240 --> 53:13.080]  I'm gonna give the number out.
[53:13.080 --> 53:13.920]  We're gonna take your calls.
[53:13.920 --> 53:15.240]  I'm gonna get to the laptop news, all of it.
[53:15.240 --> 53:16.840]  But that was a big deal right there.
[53:16.840 --> 53:18.920]  They are so scared.

[53:46.720 --> 53:49.080]  until the earliest mid-December
[53:49.080 --> 53:50.680]  because of the supply chain breakdown.

[54:02.280 --> 54:03.560]  And then we're still gonna keep it discounted
[54:03.560 --> 54:06.000]  but not 50% off because we gotta find our operation.

[54:24.160 --> 54:26.440]  I've gotta work five more hours and coffee.

[54:42.240 --> 54:43.240]  We'll be right back.
[54:46.240 --> 54:49.440]  It was 30 months ago that info wars,
[54:49.440 --> 54:51.320]  and of course, here's truly Alex Jones,
[54:51.320 --> 54:55.360]  was banned on more than 60 major platforms in one day,
[54:55.360 --> 54:57.440]  led by the CEO of Apple Tim Cook,
[54:57.440 --> 54:59.840]  who helps China run giant death camps.
[54:59.840 --> 55:02.200]  Always just let that be in the back of your mind
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.800]  when you talk about these monsters
[55:03.800 --> 55:05.400]  and where they're taking us.
[55:05.400 --> 55:07.480]  They have no bottom.
[55:07.480 --> 55:09.120]  And people said, Jones, how are you taking it?
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.320]  And I said, I'm taking it just fine.
[55:10.320 --> 55:11.680]  They're coming for you next.
[55:11.680 --> 55:12.720]  This is a technocracy.
[55:12.720 --> 55:14.280]  They're emerging with big pharma.
[55:14.280 --> 55:15.320]  They're taking it with the media.
[55:15.320 --> 55:18.000]  This is a digital psychological dictatorship
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.240]  in their own words.
[55:19.240 --> 55:21.320]  This is a planetary takeover.
[55:21.320 --> 55:23.240]  They're then going to start locking us on our houses
[55:23.240 --> 55:25.840]  using supposed plague threats.
[55:25.840 --> 55:28.960]  That's so the wireless system can come into place
[55:28.960 --> 55:31.400]  with the driverless cars and the robot takeover.
[55:31.400 --> 55:32.800]  How did I know all this would happen?
[55:32.800 --> 55:35.120]  Because they've been saying they're going to do it.
[55:35.120 --> 55:37.680]  You see, it's not that I'm psychic.
[55:37.680 --> 55:40.240]  I know how to read what these monsters are saying.
[55:40.240 --> 55:42.720]  So you have to understand, as crazy as all this sounds,
[55:42.720 --> 55:43.920]  it doesn't come from me.
[55:43.920 --> 55:45.480]  It comes from them.
[55:45.480 --> 55:48.680]  With two weeks left until the historic election,
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.960]  we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[55:50.960 --> 55:53.440]  the top some already amazing sales.
[55:53.440 --> 55:56.720]  It's Black Friday comes in October special,
[55:56.720 --> 55:59.080]  something we did last year that was very, very popular.
[55:59.080 --> 56:01.080]  We did it for the whole month last year.
[56:01.080 --> 56:03.800]  We can only do it for 11 days till the end of the month
[56:03.800 --> 56:06.720]  because stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products.
[56:06.720 --> 56:09.800]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing
[56:09.800 --> 56:13.800]  at 50% off with free shipping is Ultra 12,

[56:27.240 --> 56:29.680]  to make sure your body uploads it better.
[56:29.680 --> 56:33.520]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com.

[56:49.920 --> 56:52.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:56.280 --> 57:01.040]  ["Wage and War on Corruption," by Alex Jones plays in the background.]
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.160]  Wage and war on corruption, broadcasting warm body.
[57:04.160 --> 57:05.880]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[57:05.880 --> 57:07.080]  We're taking your calls.
[57:07.080 --> 57:09.600]  This hour number goes out right now,
[57:09.600 --> 57:12.280]  eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine.
[57:12.280 --> 57:14.840]  Eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine.
[57:14.840 --> 57:16.480]  And that one call that was still on hold yesterday
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.720]  and the answers will put him up front,
[57:18.720 --> 57:21.000]  eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, Alex.
[57:23.600 --> 57:24.440]  Okay.
[57:25.560 --> 57:27.280]  You can call in about any subject you want,
[57:27.280 --> 57:29.680]  the election, the laptop, all of it.
[57:29.680 --> 57:31.240]  I would love to hear from you.
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.000]  I've got a lot to cover, but I'm gonna just repeat something
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.720]  I said earlier, because it's so important.
[57:38.720 --> 57:40.560]  Can you believe how good Trump is?
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.280]  The media is spinning it like he's gonna get in trouble
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.720]  because he's being too mean.
[57:49.720 --> 57:51.280]  He better stop being too mean.
[57:52.600 --> 57:53.840]  What's Obama saying?
[57:53.840 --> 57:57.240]  Don't talk about secret cabals and shadow government.
[57:57.240 --> 57:58.360]  That's ridiculous.
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.480]  And CNN and MSNBC, oh my gosh, you're calling us crooks.
[58:05.480 --> 58:06.920]  You're calling Hunter Biden a crook.
[58:06.920 --> 58:07.760]  Don't do that.
[58:07.760 --> 58:09.240]  It's crediting.
[58:09.240 --> 58:11.040]  Oh, and I forgot.
[58:11.040 --> 58:13.480]  Golly gee, tonight, we're gonna be here live.
[58:13.480 --> 58:14.400]  I'm gonna be here.
[58:14.400 --> 58:15.600]  I will be here.
[58:15.600 --> 58:16.960]  Lately, I've been saying I'll be here at night
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.160]  and then I just get tired and don't come up here.
[58:20.360 --> 58:23.080]  But wild horses cannot drag me away.
[58:23.080 --> 58:25.240]  So I'll be a good boy and won't eat too big a dinner.
[58:25.240 --> 58:26.800]  I go home, my wife makes some big dinner
[58:26.800 --> 58:30.480]  and then I'm like, eat it, oh, I can't go back in.
[58:30.480 --> 58:31.960]  Then I go to sleep at like night at night.
[58:31.960 --> 58:33.320]  That's not happening tonight.
[58:33.320 --> 58:36.840]  I will be up here hovering with Owen Shroyer,
[58:36.840 --> 58:40.440]  Deanna Lorraine and others.
[58:40.440 --> 58:43.640]  The final debate, Trump versus Biden
[58:43.640 --> 58:48.640]  with special assistance from Kristen Welker.
[58:50.800 --> 58:53.640]  Coverage starts at 5 p.m. central during the war room
[58:53.640 --> 58:55.960]  with Owen the destroyer, Shroyer.
[58:55.960 --> 58:58.680]  And then I'll be in here with Deanna Lorraine
[58:58.680 --> 59:00.040]  and others tonight.
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.720]  And Trump needs to just, here's what happens.
[59:04.720 --> 59:07.920]  It happened with Chris Wallace, it happened with the last lady.
[59:08.880 --> 59:11.080]  That was just a debate with her,
[59:11.080 --> 59:14.200]  is they don't interrupt Biden when he goes off in a tangent,
[59:14.200 --> 59:15.520]  but when Trump does, they do.
[59:15.520 --> 59:17.560]  It's like, that's not true.
[59:17.560 --> 59:19.960]  Trump's like, oh, I'm debating you.
[59:19.960 --> 59:21.520]  I mean, it's crazy.
[59:21.520 --> 59:23.360]  It's like in the movie Gladiator,
[59:23.360 --> 59:24.720]  where they stab him first
[59:24.720 --> 59:28.320]  so the little princeling can fight him.
[59:28.320 --> 59:30.320]  He still beats him, but I mean,
[59:30.320 --> 59:33.300]  how about they just, Trump comes out in a ball gag.
[59:33.300 --> 59:38.100]  I mean, seriously, with a sock stuffed in his mouth,
[59:38.100 --> 59:39.660]  because that's what's going on.
[59:39.660 --> 59:41.060]  We'll get your take on that as well,
[59:41.060 --> 59:43.660]  877-789-2539.
[59:45.560 --> 59:49.820]  And I will hit the news on the Biden laptop
[59:49.820 --> 59:53.720]  that we've not gotten to yet, here in just a moment.
[59:53.720 --> 59:58.720]  But I gotta tell you, I am stunned, stunned, stunned
[59:58.720 --> 1:00:03.720]  at the discipline of the mainstream media
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.080]  not touching the laptop.
[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:08.720]  I mean, they won't even get into it.
[1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:09.560]  They won't discuss it.
[1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:10.960]  More laptops have come out.
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:12.560]  All these witnesses are coming out
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:14.840]  that had the emails on the other side confirming it.
[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:17.360]  I mean, obviously they had that a month ago.
[1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:20.880]  And, but then every news channel,
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:22.480]  the London Guardian, you name it,
[1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:24.920]  Giuliani's got big questions.
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:28.000]  Giuliani's in trouble by Sacha Bericone.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:29.640]  He thought it was an underage girl.
[1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:32.040]  They tell him, please wait here, sir.
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:33.400]  Just like he did Ron Paul.
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:36.720]  He goes in, they say, oh, we're done now.
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:37.560]  I did this all the time.
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:39.080]  I went to the bathroom the day I was being interviewed
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:40.640]  this morning about TV crew.
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:41.520]  I went to the bathroom to do it,
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:43.680]  but I mean, you gotta get your pants down and get it out.
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:45.220]  He just, oh, we're ready for your microphone.
[1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:47.920]  Okay, Giuliani's done this probably 5,000 times
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:49.480]  as many times as I've done it or more.
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:50.720]  Pulls the cord out, so they do it.
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:52.920]  They put it on your side, it goes up your shirt.
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.720]  You've got to grab it, he reaches in.
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.640]  He's now trying to rape her.
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:58.800]  Whole thing staged.
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:03.440]  He says it's a complete fabrication,
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:04.520]  but you see the other headlines.
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:06.160]  It's, oh, he's in trouble.
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:09.440]  Every new channel, oh, is this illegal that Giuliani did?
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:13.520]  In a room with a 15-year-old who wasn't 15, she was 22.
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:17.880]  And it was Barat, Barat.
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:21.600]  Sacha Bericone, a creepy guy that's not even American
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:25.800]  that prays on our country and calls for the end
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:28.760]  of free speech and the arrest of our president.
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:31.400]  What he is, is an enemy operative and a criminal
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:33.560]  who thinks he's better than you and your family
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:35.280]  and who's praying on you and your family.
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.720]  I hope he burns in hell.
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:39.760]  Disgusting maggot.
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.120]  Unbelievable criminal.
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:42.440]  So there's the media covering up
[1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:44.520]  all the real pedophilia, Hunter Biden with his niece,
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.160]  and tortured girls trying to set up Giuliani.
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:49.960]  That's the time of devilish filth we're dealing with.
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:52.480]  Burn in hell, Sacha Bericone, burn.
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:54.480]  History is now.
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.480]  History is taking place in front of us.
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:58.480]  We are at the crossroads.
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:00.480]  We are now only two weeks out
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:02.480]  for the most historic and important election
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:03.480]  in world history.
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:05.480]  I've been saying that for over a year,
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:07.480]  but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating.
[1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:08.480]  This is so critical.
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:10.480]  The New World Order wants to repudiate the nation state.
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:12.480]  They'll repudiate the idea of America.
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:14.480]  They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.480]  and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy.
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:19.480]  So they are.
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:22.480]  Throwing everything they've got,
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:25.480]  not just the American people, but the people of the world.
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:28.480]  That's why your word of mouth is beyond game.
[1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:30.480]  It is paramount.
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:32.480]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos,
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:34.480]  when you shoot your own video, or write your own article,
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:36.480]  or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them,
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:39.480]  or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:41.480]  When you speak out against the system,
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:43.480]  when you do things that seem little,
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:45.480]  together it adds up into giant things.
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:47.480]  Many hands make life work.
[1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:50.480]  History's happening now. Take action now while you still can.
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:03:18.480]  Please, for all of our futures.
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:20.480]  My name is Ron Paul.
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:24.480]  I was the 2008 presidential candidate.
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:27.480]  So, Tony, who are you wearing?
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:30.480]  Well, I don't even know, because it's pretty conventional,
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:33.480]  and I'm pretty, in that sense, pretty ordinary.
[1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:36.480]  But the message is not ordinary.
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:51.480]  Do you want some champagne?
[1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:53.480]  Oh, I don't care for any now.
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:56.480]  There's no ice bucket, but I know a good place to put it.
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:59.480]  Yeah, you were great in that.
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:01.480]  Have you done a lot of television before?
[1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:03.480]  Oh, well, off the norm.
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:06.480]  There was this last year, a tremendous amount.
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:08.480]  Sure.
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:10.480]  Do you want some strawberries or maybe some oysters?
[1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:12.480]  I'm okay.
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:15.480]  I'm going to light some candles if that's okay.
[1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:18.480]  It really loosens you up.
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:21.480]  Has anyone ever told you you look like Enrique Iglesias?
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:23.480]  Mm-hmm.
[1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:25.480]  Of course not. You're much cuter.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:31.480]  Ah-ha-ha!
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.480]  I love music.
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.480]  Dancing. I used to be a dancer.
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:38.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:41.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:44.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:47.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:51.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:53.480]  Whoops.
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:55.480]  My nose isn't as good as that.
[1:04:55.480 --> 1:04:57.480]  Hey, get out of here!
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.480]  All right, this is Andy.
[1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:04.480]  Now, the reason we played that again, if you're a radio listener,
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:06.480]  you can hear it's Ron Paul.
[1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:11.480]  It is the sinister, criminal, Sasha Baricone,
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:14.480]  un-American filth, who literally goes on TV and says,
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:17.480]  arrest Big Tech if they don't censor Alex Jones,
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:19.480]  completely off, eradicate everyone.
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:22.480]  The closest thing to Hitler is Sasha Baricone.
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:26.480]  This monster uses our open free speech to degrade our country,
[1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:28.480]  turn it down to say we're racist and evil,
[1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:32.480]  to set people up.
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:35.480]  The supremacist.
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:38.480]  And then his specialty is saying you're being interviewed in a hotel
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:42.480]  and to say, oh, the lights have broken.
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:44.480]  This is what happened to Julianne, I mean, I don't know.
[1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:46.480]  It was obviously what he did. Please come in here and wait.
[1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:48.480]  There's no chairs.
[1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:50.480]  There's a bed.
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:54.480]  You sit on the bed.
[1:05:54.480 --> 1:06:00.480]  And then he comes in, blocks the door and pulls his pants down on you.
[1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:04.480]  I mean, listen, I wish he'd pull that with me because I'd break his jaw
[1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:06.480]  if he was lucky.
[1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:08.480]  I mean, and Ron Paul almost punched him in the face.
[1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:10.480]  I've talked to him about it off air.
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:13.480]  You see him. I mean, the guy's not a wimp.
[1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:18.480]  And the point is, is that that's the type of crap that's going on here.
[1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:23.480]  Imagine you're in a hotel room and a dude drops his drawers,
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:27.480]  wearing a thong,
[1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:31.480]  and then chases him out the door.
[1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.480]  And Ron Paul's like, that guy's a fag.
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:35.480]  Oh, he's homophobic.
[1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:38.480]  Give me a break, folks. Imagine if that was a woman,
[1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:42.480]  even back then, 10 years ago.
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:47.480]  A woman, you get a woman in a room and then you drop your pants on her.
[1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:49.480]  That's called sexual assault, folks.
[1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.480]  That's called exposure.
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:54.480]  That's called trauma. Oh, but a man, he's tough.
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:57.480]  Kind of like our school age boys can be taught at eight to have their balls
[1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:58.480]  chopped off.
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:00.480]  They were telling little girls have their ovaries removed.
[1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:01.480]  Oh, you're really a little boy.
[1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:04.480]  Let's cut your ovaries out because the real target's appropriation.
[1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:07.480]  Oh, you're a tough boy. You can get your balls cut off.
[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:13.480]  It's sexual mutilization.
[1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:17.480]  That's what they're doing is mutilating the children.
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:20.480]  And it's all their admitted plan.
[1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:24.480]  So they're literally watching him on all these hidden cameras right next door.
[1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:25.480]  And it's on the video.
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:29.480]  That's why they haven't released it yet, but Juliana's just grabbed what happens.
[1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:35.480]  And as soon as he starts taking his mic off, she runs into the room.
[1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:36.480]  He leans up.
[1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:42.480]  She reaches for the mic, taking it off of him to get him to have contact with her
[1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:45.480]  because this is just a scam operation, a setup, criminals.
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:52.480]  And Sasha Barakona runs in, dressed like a woman, scannily clad in a thong and a
[1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:54.480]  pink top saying, she's too young.
[1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:56.480]  She's 15 and half sex with me.
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:00.480]  And Juliana reportedly said, what the hell is this and ran out of the room?
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:03.480]  So imagine they're watching him on TV in the room next to him.
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:04.480]  They say, oh, the interview is over.
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:05.480]  He goes, okay, he leans back.
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:07.480]  He goes to take the mic.
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:09.480]  You put it in your back pocket or your side.
[1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:13.480]  You string it under the shirt and you pin it right here.
[1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:15.480]  So you've got to pull your stuff out to get it.
[1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:18.480]  So they're watching in the room right next door.
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:21.480]  And the minute Juliana goes to do that, they're like, oh, I can take it off.
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:22.480]  Okay, sure.
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:23.480]  They leave.
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:24.480]  He leans back to take it out.
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:25.480]  They run into framing.
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:29.480]  This was a criminal frame up.
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.480]  And we're like, oh, it's just free speech.
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:34.480]  It's just Sasha Barakona.
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:39.480]  He's just a comedian that says, arrest Alex Jones.
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:42.480]  Lock him up for his speech and arrest Big Tech and let the ADL run America.
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.480]  That's what's going on in 2020.
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:50.480]  These people are authoritarians and they are dangerous.
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:57.480]  And then they've got some sex operative woman posing as an underage girl.
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:08:59.480]  They invite him up for an interview.
[1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:01.480]  He goes there and they go, oh, here she is.
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:02.480]  She is 15.
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:03.480]  Like, okay, whatever.
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:04.480]  Oh, go in here, please.
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:05.480]  You can take mic off now.
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:06.480]  Okay.
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:07.480]  We go away.
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:08.480]  We'll give you time.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:09.480]  They're right next door.
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:13.480]  As soon as he sticks his hand in his pants, block a wire, they come and jump on him.
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:15.480]  And then she's, oh, let me touch wire.
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:16.480]  Let me touch you.
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:20.480]  Let me get on your body to have that shot from the hidden cameras they've got.
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:22.480]  What a group of criminals.
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:26.480]  Oh, it's Sasha Barakona, a celebrated liberal.
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:34.480]  He's a monstrous, filthy, disgusting, un-American enemy of this country trying to set people
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:38.480]  up and he thinks it's funny because he thinks you're there to be set up by him.
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:43.480]  And he goes to all these events and sings racist songs and tries to get white people
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:45.480]  to sing along, but he can't do it.
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:48.480]  So now he's resorted to things like this.
[1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:49.480]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:55.480]  Next segment, I'm going to go to Alyssa in Alaska, Jeff's first from Canada, and David
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:10:00.480]  and Kim and Jeremiah and Salvador in Chicago, Christian and Delaware, Brandon in New York,
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:05.480]  DJ in New York, Walt, we're getting to everybody this hour.
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  And then James O'Keefe pops in middle of the next hour.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.480]  We have plenty of time for your calls.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:13.480]  We'll take more calls than even this.
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:15.480]  I promise you I'm going to write your calls and come back.
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:17.480]  Let me hit the other nose.
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:18.480]  This is so incredible.
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:24.480]  GOP Senator Ron Johnson asked DOJ IG Horowitz to open investigation to FBI handling of
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:26.480]  Hunter Biden's laptop.
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:28.480]  It's now confirmed what's on it.
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:33.480]  It's all there, pedophilia, everything, including it looks like sex.
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:38.480]  I'm not trying to have sex with his niece, but that's just liberal in the way it is.
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  It's all Giuliani that's bad, set up by, again, trying to make him look like what they are.
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:49.480]  Basically, Sachsburg Cohen is there to defend the pedophile lobby.
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:55.480]  And the ADL was founded by organized crime to protect a man convicted of murdering a
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.480]  little girl in pedophilia.
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:02.480]  And their job is destroying this country, destroying Israel as well, because the devil
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:04.480]  always creates a counterfeit.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  And the ADL is just a shameful criminal organization sworn to destroy freedom in this
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.480]  country and is a clear and present danger, just as bad as the Southern property law
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:13.480]  center.
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:17.480]  And again, this guy, once all our speech, he wants me arrested for my speech, but he
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:20.480]  gets to run around and set people up because he thinks he's better than you.
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:21.480]  He thinks he's royalty.
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:22.480]  He thinks he's God.
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:23.480]  He's like Obama.
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:24.480]  He's like Hillary.
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:28.480]  He's like all these globalists, Bill Clinton.
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.480]  They all think they're better than you.
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:33.480]  Youced water into pedophilia.
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:37.480]  because they love to have power over innocent people and they love putting mask on you and
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  they love controlling your speech and they love all the AI censorship and they love
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:44.480]  it, love it, love it, love it, love it.
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:45.480]  Love it.
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:46.480]  Love it.
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:47.480]  Love it.
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:48.480]  Love it.
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:49.480]  Love it.
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:50.480]  Love it.
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:51.480]  Love it.
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:52.480]  Love it.
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:53.480]  Love it.
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:54.480]  Love it.
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:55.480]  Love it.
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:56.480]  Love it.
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:57.480]  Love it.
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:58.480]  Love it.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:11:59.480]  Love it.
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:00.440]  Love it.
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:04.200]  of emails as he witnessed Joe and Hunter discussing deals and money.
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:08.520]  Obama mocks Trump for believing secret cabals run the world, buddy, you're out in the open.
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:11.080]  We just witnessed a clear example of foreign interference in the election.
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:15.080]  This is all infowars.com.
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:22.240]  What Trump do with his Sacha Barrico and interview back when he was Ali G 20 years ago, he interviews
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:23.240]  30 seconds long.
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:24.740]  Let's go out to break weather.
[1:12:24.740 --> 1:12:28.040]  I don't have time to play it now, but he says, this is fake.
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:29.040]  Got up and left.
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:30.360]  He said, you have a nice day.
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:31.360]  I'll see you later, buddy.
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:32.360]  This isn't real.
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:34.760]  I sat down to hear your real business.
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:35.760]  This is a joke.
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  Look, Trump's looking around.
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:37.760]  You saw Ron Paul get something.
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:38.760]  He's looking around.
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:39.760]  We're the hidden cameras.
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:40.760]  It's a setup.
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  We see you.
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:46.440]  Your whole world is about conning us and scamming us and getting it over us with your stupid
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:47.440]  COVID crap.
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:51.160]  We're done with the chai comms and the new world order and all of it.
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  We're done with you.
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.660]  Get out of our lives.
[1:12:53.660 --> 1:12:59.160]  It was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:00.160]  location.
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:06.120]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:11.120]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:16.320]  droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:21.240]  talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:26.880]  doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:32.960]  just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:35.480]  into those systems to be saved forever.
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:39.640]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:40.760]  on information.
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:43.960]  This is the global Chinese communist social credit score.
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:49.800]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:53.680]  tracks, infowarstore.com.
[1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:59.080]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election, and the globalist
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:03.520]  controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.640]  The whole planet is a huge populist realignment, and so they've openly said, we need to go
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:15.000]  to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking and arresting anyone
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.120]  that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.000]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.040]  base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:31.400]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying, it's what the Obama bots are saying,
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:35.520]  it's what Keith Overman's saying, it's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:41.200]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent, and they intend to keep the lockdowns
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:43.360]  going forever and force denoculations.
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.640]  They're trying to end the lockdowns and the sick vaccines will be voluntary.
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:52.280]  Donald Trump or die, you've got to get Trump in, everybody get out there and vote and tell
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:56.680]  your family to vote now.
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:05.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:13.680]  Okay, we're going right to your phone calls, I'm your host Alex Jones, but I've got an
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:16.680]  action alert, action, action, action, action.
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:23.520]  We've got a powerful weapon in the fight for the republic and the planet, and it's called
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:29.040]  the truth, and it's called taking action and forcing will.
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:33.120]  Last week I got contacted by a very credible source in Texas of all places that must be
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:34.120]  rampant.
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:39.200]  This morning, another source here at the office was contacted by folks in the city government
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:44.240]  of Austin about their families that are in nursing homes getting multiple ballots and
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:49.880]  it happening throughout the nursing homes printed out in their name, ready to go to
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:53.800]  them off a database, just like the dead cat got one, you know, dead people get them as
[1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:54.800]  well.
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:58.520]  80 million of them have been sent out, and Texas is not as bad as other states, so it
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:15:59.520]  must be horrible.
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:04.240]  And we're seeing those numbers come out, just crazy stuff everywhere, ballots and trash cans
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:08.120]  and rivers and gullies being burned, the backs of people's cars, people filling it out on
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:12.960]  video, turning them in who aren't even them, you know, doing it in Germantown, Maryland
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:15.240]  on camera.
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:16.440]  It's crazy.
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:21.960]  Well, everybody I talked to is like, well, yeah, we went and got the extra ballots and
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:28.400]  yeah, we've got them, but you know, we're just not going to talk to you because we're
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:33.080]  scared for our jobs, right, but don't worry, we'll destroy the extra ballots.
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:36.280]  Having the extra ballots is illegal.
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:40.680]  You need to report it to the police, people like, well, we'll get fired from the city
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:41.680]  of Austin.
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:44.840]  Well, I mean, my God, we're going to lose everything anyways.
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:49.800]  You can't report ballot mistakes, but see, everybody knows you would get fired.
[1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:52.160]  So I have limited resources.
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:53.160]  I'm not complaining.
[1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:56.280]  I'm frustrated that it's like I'm a cop.
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:59.320]  I'm like a police substation and that's 10 cops in it and there's like a hundred calls
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:00.320]  an hour coming in.
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.760]  I mean, I can't handle it, but you know what, somebody's got to do it.
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:04.600]  So we're creating a new email.
[1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:12.040]  We're going to try to check every hour, vote at infowars.com and all over the country.
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:15.520]  Just go see your parents in the nursing home because you know what's happening in Texas
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:18.520]  and I've seen reports of multiple ballots in Michigan too.
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:23.440]  You know it's happening everywhere and just go check on your parents or check on your
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:29.080]  sister or your brother or, or you're just, you know what, if you've got a dog, you know,
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:34.280]  say it's a whatever they call where you go visit people with the animal to make them
[1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:36.080]  feel good companion animal.
[1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:40.520]  I mean, I've gone and had country music played at nursing homes for people and my grandmother
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:43.440]  was in there and brought the dog in there to see her, made her real happy.
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:45.360]  So I mean, I've done that.
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:49.680]  Go visit the nursing home with your dog, go visit there and see if there's a stack of
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:56.120]  ballots sitting right there and then report it, but if you're in a Democrat County, you
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:59.160]  cannot report it to them because they will do nothing.
[1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:01.240]  Give it to the Texas Rangers.
[1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:03.200]  Give it to the attorney general.
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:04.520]  Give it to the lieutenant governor.
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:08.480]  I wouldn't give it to, wouldn't give it to the governor we got now.
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.320]  He's basically Gavin Newsom's creature or I'm going to your calls.
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:18.880]  Vote at infowars.com, send in your info and we need you to show the ballots and I don't
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:19.880]  even care if we get the story.
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:24.800]  Notice, I don't say, oh, send it to us and we'll do a report on it, we'll try.
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:25.800]  But do this.
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:26.800]  Send it to everybody.
[1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:32.800]  Send it to Fox News, send it to local newspapers, send it and then it'll get out because I don't
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:35.160]  care about breaking the story.
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:37.680]  I just care about beating these monsters.
[1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:44.040]  I'm really pissed right now because I was busy last week and was told about this by another
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:48.800]  source and just kind of mulled over it and because I get busy and I forget what I'm working
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:55.200]  on and there's so much happening and then now it's confirmed again and they are scared
[1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:59.240]  to show it to us.
[1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:02.560]  So that's what this country's turned into.
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:07.640]  I mean, I guess it's courage to even let somebody know what's going on.
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:11.800]  Vote at infowars.com, Jeff in Canada.
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:13.320]  Thank you for being here today, sir.
[1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:14.320]  We appreciate you.
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:15.320]  Go ahead.
[1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:19.800]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:27.480]  I watched Giuliani's podcast last night and I really think that the information is so
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:28.800]  damning against Biden.
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:32.760]  I don't know if they can survive it if the information gets out.
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:39.240]  So I think they're going to go for broke to try and shut everything down and the thoughts
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:44.360]  I've been having is, what's the info wars contingency plan and I had a few ideas about
[1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:51.560]  it if you're totally taken off the air and we can't share articles and even if people
[1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:57.920]  are banned, is there a contingency plan in place that you have?
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:02.040]  Well, we have our own satellites, our own radio and TV stations.
[1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:06.720]  You can always find us by searching Alex Jones live, Alex Jones podcast, Alex Jones local
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:09.520]  radio and there are hundreds of stations that are restreaming us.
[1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:10.760]  You can get around it.
[1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:16.240]  But yes, we've been getting hit in the last two months with attacks hundreds of times
[1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:21.600]  bigger than any previous attack, attacks that I'm not going to give who the big companies
[1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:25.440]  we use, but they're saying these are governmental level attacks, some of the biggest they've
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:28.880]  ever seen on private companies and it's all out of communist China.
[1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:31.200]  They're not even hiding the IP addresses.
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:34.720]  So they work with the Democrats and they're trying to shut us down.
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:38.920]  I told you this a month ago and now the FBI came out, the NSA came out and said, the public
[1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:42.320]  needs to know the Chinese are hacking our cell towers.
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:43.960]  They're hacking our dams.
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:45.680]  They're hacking our power plants.
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:47.480]  They're hacking red lights.
[1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:52.400]  That's why it's cell phones have been down in Austin, round rock, they've been, I mean,
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.280]  right now I can tell you this is secret.
[1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:55.280]  The Chinese knows.
[1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:56.280]  I'll just say it.
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:01.040]  A lot of dams and a lot of power relay centers now have people watching it and they've basically
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:04.000]  taken the computers offline most of the time.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.400]  So they'll turn computers on, let them calibrate stuff, then they turn them off for a while
[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:12.240]  and let it run by hand because there's so many Chinese attacks.
[1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:13.360]  They're doing fishing deals.
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:18.720]  They're doing spoofing, they're just, they're hitting everywhere and it's just absolute total
[1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:19.720]  sabotage.
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:26.280]  And remember, Obama seven years ago gave the keys of all 22 million U.S. government assets,
[1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:31.720]  their families, their numbers, their files to the Chinese and they've just, they've infiltrated
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:32.720]  everything.
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:35.080]  I mean, we are just, I mean, I'm sure we're so infiltrated.
[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:39.680]  And again, the Washington Post says, G.G. Ping is our king, destroy Trump.
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:40.680]  We love China.
[1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:41.680]  We love communism.
[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:47.480]  He goes to Davos and they say, G.G. Ping will crush America and he is saluted on both sides
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:51.920]  by, by Yunker and by Soros.
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:55.120]  I mean, you couldn't, I mean, literally they saluted him on the stage and had tears in
[1:21:55.120 --> 1:22:00.840]  their eyes as their champion and Yunker said, G.G. Ping will defeat Trump in America.
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:04.840]  They even say, oh, Trump, they said America.
[1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:07.720]  Here is the heir to the entire Nazi fortune.
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:12.920]  His grandfather was the richest Nazi, the richest German, German royalty.
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:15.600]  They were so rich that they didn't even get in trouble in World War II.
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:17.760]  He is, he is the owner of Luxembourg.
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:18.760]  Okay.
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:21.720]  If you want to get down to brass tacks, he's probably the richest man on earth that we
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:22.720]  know of.
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:23.720]  Okay.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:24.720]  And he's above the Rothschilds.
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:29.360]  He literally is drunk on the stage saluting G.G. Ping when you'll kick America and you'll
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:36.280]  get trumplings across them and Soros is like wandering around like, you got to watch the
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:37.280]  video.
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:39.600]  We played it before and I mean, and he's a Nazi collaborator.
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:40.600]  They're crazy people.
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:46.160]  Have you seen the video of Yunker running up and like humping women on TV and like grabbing
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:47.160]  men and stuff?
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:48.160]  Have you seen these people?
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:50.680]  Oh, they're, it's a complete mess.
[1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:52.200]  They're a complete joke.
[1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:58.280]  But Alex, my concern is that if, if you are taken off the air one day, we all tune in
[1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:02.920]  with the millions of people that tune in and all of a sudden there's no transmission.
[1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:04.560]  I will tell you the best way to get around it.
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:09.800]  We'll still be able to shoot a video or have an article and email it to you.
[1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:15.720]  And so everybody should sign up at the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[1:23:15.720 --> 1:23:19.320]  infowars.com forward slash newsletter, just put your name in, create a new account if
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:21.280]  you don't want to go into your main account, whatever.
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:25.520]  And then if it's not a Google account or something else, cause they can block that now, if it's
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:30.160]  a private email or a smaller email company, they won't be able to block the URL.
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:32.080]  And so I would sign up for the free newsletter.
[1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:33.800]  That is the battle plan.
[1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:35.680]  And I would just tell listeners, that's a big subject.
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:36.680]  We can do a whole show.
[1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:39.440]  You know, I thought about last week, thank you for the call, sir.
[1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:44.760]  I thought about last week, Jeff doing a whole four hour show on this could be our last show.
[1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:46.800]  And what would I say on my last show?
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:47.800]  You know what?
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:52.960]  Next Tuesday, I'm going to do a show called my last show ever question mark vitamin mineral
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.440]  fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months.
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:02.360]  They're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins,
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:07.640]  minerals, especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:08.640]  immune system.
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:14.880]  Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com is two weeks off from the election.
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:20.520]  And we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple patriot points to your
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:21.520]  next order.
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:25.760]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of the things we're
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:29.400]  selling lost leaders now, we have had a big clearance sale going.
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:33.080]  So a lot of stuff sold out while the other stuff is close to selling out, but some of
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:36.720]  our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually come back in to stock.
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:40.920]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:42.200]  that have actually sold out.
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:44.280]  So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.640]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the year.
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:49.880]  Obviously, we're critical to fight and you've helped win the war against the global so
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:52.280]  far.
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:56.800]  If you pay close attention to what big tech is actually saying, and more importantly,
[1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:02.920]  what they're actually doing when they shut down the hunter Biden laptop story, that was
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:08.520]  a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress information because they've
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:13.320]  also been on record saying coming up on election day and thereafter, they're not going to let
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:18.280]  anyone but quote authoritative sources, that means CNN, New York Times want to joke, come
[1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:21.280]  out and say who the real winner is.
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:24.640]  That way they can contest the election, even though Trump's declare winner, hold everything
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:29.800]  up with the ballots, then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession and have the UN
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:32.440]  come in and declare the election for Biden.
[1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:35.200]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:39.520]  And so when you see them in concert, censoring something like the hunter Biden laptop story,
[1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:44.040]  that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:48.720]  the public that big tech works in unison to suppress speech and information.
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.520]  This is election meddling 101.
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:55.560]  This is illegal 2020 election center.com.
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:56.560]  Just type it in one time.
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:25:58.280]  You've got to save right there in your browser.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:03.480]  And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms.
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:10.200]  Most importantly, via text message, email or by word of mouth because they have banned
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:17.440]  the links to ban.video.2020electioncenter.com is a clone of the side of the exact same links,
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:20.920]  the exact same videos, where you can comment and share them everything.
[1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:27.360]  The system is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:31.520]  Trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take action once reelected against
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:32.520]  big tech.
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:33.520]  I mean, he's modern in this situation.
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:36.600]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:38.000]  because he has taken action.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020electioncenter.com,
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.160]  2020electioncenter.com, and checking out the new redesigned infomores.com and sharing
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:49.160]  that link.
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:50.160]  Oh, that really upsets them.
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:55.160]  Oh, yeah.
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:27:20.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:43.000]  It's hard to believe this was on in the early 50s, Raw Hyde, with Clint Eastwood.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.560]  My mother said her first crush was on Clint Eastwood, when she was like 10 years old watching
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:51.320]  the show.
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:57.520]  My mom's 70 years old, amazing.
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.080]  I was watching online Raw Hydes the other day because we were playing this music.
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:04.840]  This is just good old fashioned TV shows, great acting, a lot of the same actors you
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:07.440]  see on the Twilight Zone and stuff, first rate stuff.
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:09.720]  There's that young Clint Eastwood, man, it's amazing.
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.080]  Anyways, I'm not plugging Raw Hyde here.
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.760]  I just a little nostalgia there about that.
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:19.400]  All right, let's race through your phone calls now, and then I've got some big breaking news
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:24.000]  on the gasoline Maxwell situation, what's coming out in court documents concerning Billy
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.680]  Boy Clinton on that airplane on that island, and so much more and more deaths from the
[1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:33.720]  COVID vaccine test and more deaths from the flu shots, but now it's even coming out in
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:34.720]  the news, right?
[1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:37.560]  Yeah, it's going to kill you and you're going to take it, and it doesn't protect you.
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:44.240]  All right, is Christine been home the longest, or is it Eliza Eliza in Alaska?
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:47.000]  Yeah, up in Sierra Palin territory.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I haven't been to that state yet.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.960]  Well, the few states I've been to, I want to go there someday.
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:51.200]  Eliza, thanks for joining us.
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:52.200]  Go ahead.
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:53.200]  Hi, Alex.
[1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:56.680]  Wanted to say thank you first of all for everything that you do.
[1:28:56.680 --> 1:28:57.680]  Thank you.
[1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:02.440]  And I just kind of wanted to talk to you about the current situation, the election.
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:10.880]  I love this quote by Steve Quayle, it says, there's no political solution for a country
[1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:14.760]  with a spiritual problem.
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:16.440]  Well that's somebody I want to get back on the show.
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:17.440]  I keep meaning to do that.
[1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:24.080]  In fact, I just told my producers, please get Steve Quayle on and please continue, ma'am.
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:26.520]  He has a lot of wonderful things to say.
[1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:34.000]  I just think that Americans that are like-minded to us, that have a relationship with God and
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:40.360]  want to see the best for our country, we have a lot of fear and a lot of uncertainty, but
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:47.520]  I think that we can unite in prayer and unite in that hope that President Trump will win
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:50.320]  and that the right people will take power.
[1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:56.480]  But if God's plan is different, no matter what we do, we can't win, then we have to
[1:29:56.480 --> 1:29:58.880]  prepare ourselves in a different way.
[1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:04.160]  Well, I just think God, and I mean that when I say it for you calling in, because this
[1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:09.800]  morning I was up at 5 a.m., staring into the mirror, brushing my teeth, and I was having
[1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:13.560]  a lot of anxiety over the election, a lot of anxiety over the fraud, and it was just
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:17.800]  the Holy Spirit said, you need to go on your show first thing and say it's all in God's
[1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:22.640]  hands and it's God has the power, you're killing yourself and you're killing your listeners.
[1:30:22.640 --> 1:30:27.640]  Get everybody upset, get people motivated, do the best you can, but God will do the rest.
[1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:29.160]  Stop getting upset.
[1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:32.800]  You know God's real, you know you're awake, you know people are awake.
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:38.720]  Do your job, but don't hurt yourself over it and tell others they need to distrust in
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:44.280]  God and pray and pray and pray and pray because it's that connection when we call on God that
[1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:49.400]  opens up the channel more and more like a river, from a trickle to a river so that God
[1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:55.120]  can then act through us and so we must open up the channel to God and we must be God like.
[1:30:55.120 --> 1:30:58.840]  And that means that, you know, with that we have to set up side the worldly things we
[1:30:58.840 --> 1:30:59.840]  do.
[1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:01.080]  And I got to tell you, I more and more have done that.
[1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:06.160]  I mean, I'm not a super worldly guy, but I like alcohol, I like, you know, food, I like
[1:31:06.160 --> 1:31:10.880]  sex, I like fighting, I like all those type of things and as I just as I get closer to
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:14.240]  God, those things are not really important like they were before.
[1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:17.840]  All that is important is connection to God and it's so much more fulfilling and that's
[1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:20.880]  part of the maturing process, but you're absolutely right.
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:23.120]  What else would you like to impart to us, ma'am?
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:29.480]  With what you just said, God chose the most flawed men to lead his crusades and his fights
[1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:34.960]  and that is very reflected on with you and your admittance that, you know, there's indulgences
[1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:40.000]  that you have, we all do, but I think we're all patriots here and that we just all need
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.080]  to find common ground because the time is almost up.
[1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:45.920]  And I don't know if we're going to win this or not.
[1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:48.120]  I hope President Trump wins.
[1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:49.880]  I love a lot of the things he does.
[1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:54.200]  I don't agree with him on everything, but I know that I love my country.
[1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:58.960]  I love you and your family, Alex, and all my brothers and sisters that are Americans
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:31:59.960]  and patriots.
[1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:00.960]  Well, we love you.
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:01.960]  We appreciate you, Ann.
[1:32:01.960 --> 1:32:04.600]  I want to do a special with Steve Cuell.
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:08.440]  I will come in if he'll do it this Saturday.
[1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:13.080]  I'm doing a podcast, I think until like two, but if Steve Cuell will do it, I'll come in
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:17.680]  and do a three hour commercial free podcast with him and then I will air excerpts the
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.040]  interview on Sunday if he'll do it.
[1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:23.320]  If not, I got to get Steve Cuell on because people are like, we're Steve Cuell.
[1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:27.840]  It's weird how a special guest falls to the cracks, nobody's bad, but I really do want
[1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:34.440]  to get Steve Cuell on once a month because he's very apocalyptic, but he's been right
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:37.040]  about so much of what he said.
[1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:40.000]  I think so many times he's been apocalyptic, we came right up the edge and he was probably
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:44.880]  right and then God gave us a reprieve, but I think now we really see how apocalyptic
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:45.880]  all this is.
[1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:49.960]  Okay, let's go to Kim in Connecticut, then Christian in Delaware.
[1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:50.960]  Kim, thanks for holding.
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:51.960]  Go ahead.
[1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:52.960]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:56.960]  Thanks for answering my call.
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:33:04.200]  My father-in-law is a huge fan of you and he suggested to call you.
[1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:05.200]  So hi.
[1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:06.200]  How are you?
[1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:07.200]  I'm great.
[1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:08.200]  It's so wonderful to have you listening.
[1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:09.200]  Thank you.
[1:33:09.200 --> 1:33:17.240]  So I have actually an important message for President Trump for the tonight's debate.
[1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:19.600]  And I hope I can reach to him.
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:29.840]  So I think he should bring a positive message of improving the overall health of all Americans.
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:37.000]  Promoting healthy food, vitamins, healthy lifestyle exercise, boost that immune system
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:45.560]  to fight off COVID, influenza, obesity, diabetes and all sorts of illnesses where American people
[1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:47.760]  die of.
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:51.640]  And I think his slogan should be make America healthy again.
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:54.520]  And it doesn't mean he has to be perfect.
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:58.080]  He has to recognize that he's got issues, we all have issues, and then make America
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:33:59.080]  healthy again.
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:01.360]  I think that would be a great national thing.
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:06.240]  In fact, Putin has made organic food a staple that Russia would be the biggest exporter
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:11.640]  of organic food, which was a major market for him and we need to displace the GMO.
[1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:15.400]  And Putin has said we need to make Russia healthy again, it's actually something Putin's
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:16.400]  done.
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:19.280]  I don't know, being a Russian agent, well, I mean, if the Russians have good ideas,
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:20.280]  we should adopt good ideas.
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:24.240]  I don't care if the Chinese have it or the Mexicans have it or who has it, or the Brazilians
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:29.840]  or the Nigerians or the South Africans, I don't care, but that is a fabulous idea, Kim.
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:32.640]  Make America healthy again, because we are very unhealthy.
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:41.360]  Yes, and everybody's talking about masks and taking vaccines and everything else, but
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:46.960]  the main focus should be just improving everybody's immune system so we can naturally just come
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:47.960]  back forever influenza.
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:48.960]  That's right.
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:49.960]  Well, thank you for the call.
[1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:53.280]  In all the major studies, you might can look these up, taking the flu shot lowers your
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:57.240]  immunity the next year to regular flu, and it's never worked to pick the right flu to
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:34:58.240]  give you immunity.
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:34:59.960]  It is the biggest fraud ever.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:05.680]  So when you take this new COVID vaccine that is basically a cold virus, they're saying
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:10.320]  you may have an autoimmune response in the future to regular cold viruses that kill you
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:13.840]  like the influenza flu of 1918.
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:14.840]  That's in the literature.
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:19.160]  It looks like that's what these jerks are doing is making it where regular colds and
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:22.120]  regular flu are going to kill more people.
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:23.120]  Just it's so sick.
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:24.680]  Then they'll say that's COVID into the future.
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:25.680]  See what they're doing?
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:26.960]  They're removing your immunity, folks.
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.600]  These people are jerks.
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:34.160]  Man, I tell you, because again, it's a Chimera virus, so the body doesn't just create an
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:40.880]  immunity to it, it creates an autoimmune response that's so huge, it kills you.
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:46.960]  I'm telling you, this is very sophisticated stuff going on, very, very, very sophisticated
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:48.360]  evil.
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:54.120]  But you better believe, when you hear them call it a vaccine, a vaccine goes, yeah, there's
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:35:56.600]  two different types, but look it up for yourself.
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:36:00.800]  The main one teaches telemphysites, white blood cells, how to kill something.
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:04.400]  Because if a white blood cell sees anything it's never seen before, it comes up and literally
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:08.080] ... Well, I sent you a video two weeks ago, guys, electron microscope of a white blood
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:09.080]  cell.
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:10.080]  It was the best one yet I've seen.
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:11.800]  Leigh Ann McIntyre tweeted it to all people.
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:15.400]  I saw it on her Twitter, and I went, oh, that's what I was asking you guys to get.
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:16.400]  It's like magic.
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:19.880]  You guys couldn't find it when I asked for it a month ago, but then she randomly had
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:24.480]  a white blood cell on hers eating, eating, eating viruses and bacteria, and it's like
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:29.600]  an amoeba, and it's a big cell, and it comes up, got little antennas, it touches it, smells
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:30.600]  it.
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:37.240]  And just gobbles it up, and then craps it out, it eats stuff, and then it learns how
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:42.480]  to... And then it teaches the other cells what to kill, that's what they give you an
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:45.640]  attenuated weakened virus or bacteria that you might learn how to kill it.
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:51.280]  These new ones go in and reprogram your cells randomly, it's crazy.
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:54.640]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:58.960]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:03.680]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:08.160]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.960]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:18.720]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:24.720]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:31.480]  Studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:35.920]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:41.680]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:44.520]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:50.520]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:53.240]  Black Friday in October.
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:57.680]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales that we ran in the last couple weeks
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:37:58.680]  of October.
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:37:59.680]  It was popular for a reason.
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:05.480]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.

[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:11.960]  next order.

[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:17.320]  leaders.
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  A lot of stuff sold out, some of our best sellers are still there, but some good news.
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:24.920]  Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all other vitamins and minerals and

[1:38:48.720 --> 1:39:17.720]  Black Friday comes in October.
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:21.440]  No more pesky lawn order.
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:25.080]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:30.400]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:36.080]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.200]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:51.560]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:57.600]  It's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince Congress and the
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:02.680]  rest of the world that we were only the initial target to set the precedent for a coordinated
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:04.440]  big tech censorship.
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:09.160]  Now the world finally understands it, but we don't have two and a half years for the
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:11.640]  learning curve to take place this time.
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:17.320]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying the lockdown is permanent, it is a plan to
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:23.560]  lower carbon footprint, it is a plan to make the world population poor, it is a diabolical
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:28.960]  hour grab, it is a revolution against the industrial revolution, they call it the post-industrial
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:34.000]  world and it's the excuse for them to take control of every facet of our lives and implement
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.800]  absolute authoritarianism.
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:39.480]  So again, to everybody out there, if you love your children, my daughter that just woke
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.200]  up here, and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get away, you need
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:54.640]  to understand this information, you need to warn others, okay, it's a life and death situation.
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:41:06.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:12.680]  Well Salvador in Chicago just hung up, he was up first, you get back in Salvador on
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:18.080]  the right to you, I know you're busy, I appreciate you holding, Christian, Steve, Brandon, DJ,
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:23.920]  Walt, Kathy, Jessica, David, Dango, Jay, I'm just going to the calls as they come in,
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:30.920]  but I was going to Salvador first, but he's gone, so who's up next here, that would be
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:35.960]  Christian in Delaware, thanks for holding, you're up there in Joe Biden territory.
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:43.160]  Unfortunately, and I'm going to piggyback off of the second or last caller you had,
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:49.200]  and I'm going to pray, I hope that's all right with you, go ahead brother.
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:59.920]  Father, we pray that you will be done on earth as it is in heaven, your will includes making
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:04.680]  your enemies your footstool, so Lord we ask that your enemies face judgment here on earth
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:09.240]  as they will surely face eternal judgment, Father we ask that you will soften our hearts
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:13.760]  and sharpen our minds, and though we do not deserve your blessings and never will, we
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:17.640]  ask that you guide and guard our patriot, protecting them from the schemes and wiles
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:22.440]  of the wicked ones, for it is your promise that if we turn to you, seek your face, repent
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:27.800]  and turn away from our wicked ways, you will appear from heaven and you will heal our land,
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:32.080]  we will never deserve you, yet we have you, fill us with the Holy Ghost, and for those
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:38.320]  who have not yet received, I pray that they be baptized in the Holy Ghost, and born again,
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:43.240]  in your Son's name, Yeshua, Daniel, the Christ, Amen, real quick, God has given me a task
[1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:47.040]  in which I have not been obedient about, so this would be a good starting point, more
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:51.520]  than a year ago, He gave me a vision in which He told me that all who smoke camp in siege
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:56.280]  shall surely die, Ezekiel 3, 18 says, when I say to a wicked person, you will surely
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:00.520]  die, and you do not warn them, or speak up, or dissuade them from their evil ways in order
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.520]  to save their life, that wicked person will die in their sin, and our brother, here's
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:08.080]  the deal, callers are going to hang up, I love you to death, but I got to get each call
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:11.040]  wrong, because the next person, because of the breaks, we're not going to get, or we
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:15.000]  never would have gotten to you, you called in about my laptop and Delaware police, go
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:21.560]  ahead. Yes, so what I called about, as a Delawarean,
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:26.120]  I'm very concerned that the laptop has been given to the Delaware state police, I personally
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:30.200]  submitted evidence to the Delaware state police for concerning child pornography, being traded
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:34.120]  on Instagram, when I forwarded my phone, they try to make it seem like I'm a bad person
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:38.960]  for doing so, and gathering evidence that proves underage conduct, so I'm just, you know,
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:43.320]  No, no, I hear you, I appreciate your call, I got to jump in the next person, look, the
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:47.800]  FBI already had this laptop, Giuliani gave it to the Delaware police, they gave it to
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:52.640]  the feds again, to open a congressional investigation, the FBI is on record getting this and is
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:56.800]  not doing anything, that was the point, it's like when you know somebody's home, and you're
[1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:00.520]  knocking on the door again, but I hear you brother, I don't have faith in Delaware police,
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:04.800]  state police either, at least not their leadership. Okay, let's take another call here, let's
[1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:09.360]  go to David in California, go ahead David, thanks for holding.
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:15.960]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex, I just wanted to mention something that I heard this morning
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:22.720]  on Fox, they had a Biden surrogate on there, and it's funny, she kept referring to Biden
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:29.520]  as president, president Biden, so that's almost the closer it gets, the more they project,
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:35.320]  then they also brought up the, they also brought up the question regarding Uncle's email, and
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:39.960]  sure enough, they try to dismiss it as Russian disinfo, Russian disinfo, so it's just funny
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:46.000]  how we have the same trend we saw in 2016 with the Hillary Clinton emails and Anthony Weiner
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.280]  and all this crap, and they played it off as Russian disinfo and carry it on.
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:54.560]  Oh yeah, it's the same playbook, no evidence of Russians, it's a laptop, it's real, it's
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:58.920]  confirmed, they have all these witnesses coming out that have the emails on the other end,
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:02.680]  and they just go Russia, Russia, Russia, oh really, is it Russia sold out our country,
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:06.920]  is it Russia with Drag Queen Storytime, is it Russia that has Antifa burning the cities,
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:12.240]  is it, no, I mean, look, look, the Democrats tell us Antifa doesn't exist, they're running
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:17.800]  TV ads saying Trump's lying and saying nobody's burning cities, these people are incredible
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:18.800]  David.
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:24.960]  Yeah, there's really no question, there's really no line to what they'll, you know,
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.360]  where they'll go to with their madness, so I just, I just want to, I wish, I really wish
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:32.560]  you were wrong about most of these things and all these things that are happening that
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:36.800]  are going to happen post-election, but it just seems like the more we get closer to
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:42.080]  this day, the more they want to become more radical and just, you know, just show exactly
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:46.840]  what they intend on doing as they normally do, man, and you know, they love projecting
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:47.840]  their people.
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:50.800]  Well, that's a good point, I've seen that too, they're already calling in President
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:54.640]  Biden, very, very good point, thank you for the call, let's move quicker, I want to get
[1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:58.400]  to everybody here, let's go ahead, we got a caller in Ireland, they just called in,
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.840]  we'll get to him next after a few calls, let's go ahead and talk to Brandon in New York,
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:04.840]  go ahead, Brandon, you're on the air.
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:06.840]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, buddy?
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:11.320]  Man, I tell you, I'm excited, it's a crazy time right now, 11 days out.
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:16.920]  Yeah, I just want to tell you a quick story about some Democrats here in Western New York,
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:20.840]  some of your stickers ended up on a stop sign in front of my house, I'm not sure how they
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:26.120]  got there, but my neighbors and I, we like them and there's a guy peeling them off and
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:30.000]  we confronted him and said, hey, don't do that, we like those there, he started taunting
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.440]  us and saying stuff and we go up to him, he's like, oh, I'm a minor, you know, so we left
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:38.120]  it, let him be, well, he started taking pictures of us and took the pictures of my neighbor's
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:43.400]  house, he peeled them off anyways and went on his merry way, well, two weeks later, two
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:48.240]  patrol cars show up at my neighbor's house, threatening to arrest them on a federal offense
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.320]  for some stickers that weren't even there, I thought that was kind of crazy.
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:55.720]  Wow, and you know, that's, people say the cops are perfect.
[1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:59.560]  The problem is, if you have bad government, the cops will carry out illegal orders that
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:03.920]  they're ordered to do, they shouldn't, so, so they were claiming, oh, you were violating,
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:07.280]  you know, the, the highways or the roads, by the way, a stop sign is not a federal offense,
[1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:12.400]  it'd be a post office box, just, just, just, what's your intimidation, oh, the left's all
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:16.120]  about defund the police, but they're the ones that always call them on you first, don't
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:17.120]  they?
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:22.040]  Oh yeah, yeah, he was calling my neighbor's wife, an old hag and stuff, and many of them
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.920]  just walk up to him, he just started screaming, he was a minor, I'm not sure if he was, he
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:26.920]  looked at it, he was calling.
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:30.680]  It's probably a pedophile, listen, how about, how about, how about, listen, I'm gonna put
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:34.760]  you on hold, how about, I, I wanna make sure this happens, how about I ship you a thousand
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:39.960]  free stickers, and just magically they, every time they try to suppress you, every time
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:43.640]  they suppress me, I just fight harder, and I, and when they do that, I just put even
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:47.320]  more stickers up, brother, how would you like a thousand stickers melt here right now?
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:52.760]  Alex, I got goosebumps, I'm so excited, well, I'm excited about you guys, get his name
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:57.600]  and number, get his address, and make super sure, give it to Blake, and make sure he gets
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:01.200]  a thousand stickers, every order gets a bunch of stickers, and everybody's favorite are
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:05.760]  these little ones, there's these little, little like five, six stickers on one little, little
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.240]  sheet, and then people stick them all over the place on their wallets, their phones,
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:13.520]  you know, bathrooms, wherever, and you know, don't do it in some big clean place or whatever,
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:17.440]  one of the people that, a lot of people places have it as art on the walls, I mean, my office,
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:20.400]  I've got stickers all over the walls and stuff, when it's a restaurant like that or a place
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:24.600]  where they like it, do it, but yeah, if there's a power pole with 100 stickers on it, they're
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:28.320]  not enforcing it, sticking on there, it's, it's, it's the most ancient form of communication,
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:31.720]  yeah, see that sticker pack right there in the middle, what's that one right there at
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:36.280]  the top guys, middle top right there, click on that for me, all right Brandon, thank you

[1:48:53.800 --> 1:49:01.720]  is one for your mind, InfoWars with a Gadsden snake, straight up InfoWars, bunch of 1776ers,
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:07.160]  very, very effective and the left can't stand it, they're all about suppressing you, their
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:12.160]  whole religion is not letting you have speech, their whole religion is dominating you and
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:17.120]  making you submit to them, they're against free will, God is for free will, Satan is
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:21.840]  dirt against free will, that's how you know good versus evil, they always claim it's conservatives
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:26.000]  that want to suppress your speech and no, no, no, no, conservatives want to tell you
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:29.640]  what they think is good and what they think is bad, the left are the ones that want to
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:36.040]  suppress speech and control it because they're a bunch of filth, Joseph in Ireland, thank
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:40.040]  you so much for calling, you want to talk about the big debate tonight, the InfoWars
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:44.840]  is going to cover live, go ahead, Alex, I'm just trying to get inside the mind of the
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:50.280]  enemy, no, I'm not trying to boast here, I originally thought, yep, they're going to
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:53.800]  cut the mics in the next bit, yep, next thing was announced, so I'm there thinking, what
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:56.320]  are they going to do tonight, what is it all about?
[1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:01.440]  So I just talked back into my head and I said, Tom needs to get someone to signal to
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:05.800]  him because they're going to cut his mic in the middle of sentences, but he's trying
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:09.360]  to make a point at the end, they're going to cut it and then after they'll say, oh,
[1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:12.360]  but, oh, his time was up and all that, he won't know.
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:16.640]  He should pull a little bullhorn out, they've got little ones that are super loud, just
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:17.640]  pull a little bullhorn.
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:20.520]  Sorry, I think he should have someone there signal because it's going to be caught to
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:24.360]  the audience on television and they'll pull, they won't have a camera on him, they'll
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:28.920]  pull his, you know, so I just, and I'm just down the line as well, but they are going
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:30.480]  to start a civil war.
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:33.400]  If Trump loses, they're going to, there's going to be a civil war, if Trump wins, there's
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:34.960]  going to be a civil war.
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:40.160]  And remember this, farmers, if you're loyal to Trump, they're going to turn off your tractors,
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:46.040]  your big tractors, starve your house, have small equipment that's not attached to computers.
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:48.680]  This is their move, they're going to shut off everything, all communications going to
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:49.680]  be shut off.
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:52.680]  Oh, oh, you're totally right, everything is like new cars you can't get them worked
[1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:55.480]  on and they won't let small companies work on them.
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:58.880]  They now admit that they're going to start cutting off big tractor equipment as part
[1:50:58.880 --> 1:50:59.880]  of their control.
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:00.880]  That's absolutely true.
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:07.200]  Yeah, they're also, what would happen is, I don't want to be doom and gloom Alex, but
[1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:10.160]  a civil war is coming, this is what they want.
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:14.960]  The military that go with them, their equipment will work and the guys who don't, their equipment
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:15.960]  won't work.
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:17.480]  They'll turn it off.
[1:51:17.480 --> 1:51:19.680]  Stay there, I want to come back to you Joseph.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:23.400]  You always make amazing points, you call a couple times a year, wow, we'll be right
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:24.400]  back with Joseph.
[1:51:24.400 --> 1:51:27.840]  I remember Joseph called like five years ago about the Red Dragon of China and Revelation
[1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:31.480]  and how we're at war with China and boy is it not all true now.
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:36.320]  And then we're going to go to Kathy and Jessica and Jesse and Tango and Carlos and Greg and
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:40.840]  Angela and Steve and DJ, stay with us.
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:45.600]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:49.080]  We've confirmed from high level sources in our own research that if Joe Biden is able
[1:51:49.080 --> 1:51:52.520]  to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy.
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:56.520]  They intend to not just shut down in full force, but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.560]  And here's the really bad news.
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:01.840]  They're coming after everybody and they're coming after the economy and they want to
[1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:07.080]  totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:08.080]  all the trash.
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:11.560]  But here's the really good news, the really good news.
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:16.960]  Humanity is awakening to this threat, we're no longer asleep and we understand that the
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:20.760]  globalist are our mortal enemies and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:25.920]  nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:30.680]  That's why we must come together now as Americans of a race, color and creed and repudiate the
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:35.840]  New World Order and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump, but also the information war
[1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:39.920]  support independent media that tells the truth like info wars.com.
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:41.600]  Thank you.
[1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:46.520]  With two weeks left until the historic election, we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:49.320]  the top some already amazing sales.
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:53.800]  It's Black Friday comes in October special, something we did last year that was very,
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:54.800]  very popular.
[1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:59.120]  We did it for the whole month last year, we can only do it for 11 days till the end of
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:02.520]  the month because stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products.
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:07.760]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free

[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:38.320]  products of Black Friday comes in October sale at info wars store.com or triple eight
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:45.560]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:49.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:54:00.240]  You know, I've been on air 26 plus years, I now know more than ever, God's plan drill.
[1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:05.280]  I can see every trial, every tribulation, every punishment, the went through with only
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:09.200]  getting us ready because God doesn't give you a task you can't take on.
[1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:12.800]  So you ask God to have you take action against evil.
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:15.520]  God is going to say, all right, let's make sure you got what it takes.
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:17.400]  Let's start giving you the trials.
[1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:21.440]  Let's start giving the tribulations and it's just incredible to be alive and watch all
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:22.440]  this unfolding.
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:28.120]  All right, Joseph and Ireland was getting into that legislation that's been introduced
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:34.880]  at big techs fighting where even cell phones or wrist watches or laptop computers, but
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:44.320]  also cheap electronics like toasters and or refrigerators or washing machines, alarm clocks.
[1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:48.560]  They're all high tech and they're all wireless and quote sink to other things, meaning they're
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:49.560]  all incestuous.
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:54.320]  They all spy and they were talking about how all the new cars, regular shops can't work
[1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:59.600]  on them and then the shops get them and they're not even allowed to bypass it and work on
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:01.720]  the engine and do that.
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:05.040]  So you don't really own your vehicle just like you don't own a GMO crop.
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:07.080]  I'm on Santo Terminator seed.
[1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:08.080]  You get the seeds.
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:11.160]  They don't produce new seeds that produce new plants.
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:12.160]  That's how they want humans.
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:18.440]  This is the corporate takeover, a rewrite of civilization, of society, a real war against
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:21.680]  God, a true the devil trying to become God.
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:24.720]  This is really what they're doing and everything they do doesn't work.
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:25.720]  It fails.
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:28.720]  It's poisonous, but that's the very nature of Satan.
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.920]  So I think that's what you're getting at here is that the kill switches and everything,
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:37.280]  including Chinese made chips and our military gear are the real globalist Trojan horse.
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:44.480]  Yes, I believe that I have often thought about this and I said, what's going to happen here?
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:45.960]  They're going to shut off everything.
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:51.480]  They have food stored for their little antifa, but don't forget the big army to come out
[1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:52.480]  is the al-Qaeda.
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:58.680]  The guys who are sitting there, not anti-Muslim people, but anti-Jihadi Muslim, they're sitting
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:00.280]  there just smiling to your face.
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:03.320]  I mean, we know the Wahhabist is a globalist fifth column.
[1:56:03.320 --> 1:56:04.320]  You're absolutely right.
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:09.480]  Now, antifa are the guys like a World War I, they'll throw themselves in the wire and
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:12.960]  I'll get more down most of them and they'll cause the anarchy and next thing will pop
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:19.480]  up is the Jihadis and then the coast are controlled and in will come the UN troops from Canada,
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:25.800]  Mexico will send up their divisions and America will be attacked from all sides and from within.
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:28.240]  Everything will be shut off.
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:29.240]  Agriculture will be shut down.
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:30.720]  All communications will be cut off.
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:32.200]  Now, who's going to win there, Alex?
[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:33.200]  I'm sorry.
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:34.200]  You're smart.
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:35.200]  You're right.
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:40.840]  We're seeing a perfect storm to undermine, divide the country, devalue the dollar and
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:42.840]  then finally attack from every angle.
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:43.840]  Yes.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:50.800]  And this is going to end eventually with boots on the ground and all the world media in
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:52.960]  the other countries will say, it is wonderful.
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:55.120]  The UN troops will peacekeepers.
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:57:00.000]  The New York Times, the Washington Post have all called for you in occupation of the US
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  to remove Trump.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  That's happening.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.560]  And when patriots have been put up against the wall, they're all labeled as right-wing
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  terrorists, extremists.
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:11.320]  Everyone will clap and say, brilliant, the terrorists are being killed.
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:16.760]  The real white, white, white-wing extremists, Nazis are all being killed.
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  America will be brought back.
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:22.160]  And then meanwhile, the rest of the world is already locked down under the COVID fraud
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:23.400]  under martial law.
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:26.680]  I was reading in Ireland, they're going to bring back lockdown again.
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:28.400]  No, no, it's back.
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:29.400]  We're back.
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:34.480]  And now bringing in laws where it will be a thousand quid, euros, which is more than
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:35.480]  dollars.
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:39.040]  If you have a house party, it'll be 500 if you cross.
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:44.040]  So the British could never occupy all of Ireland and control it with men, but now they're
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:45.560]  using fear to do it.
[1:57:45.560 --> 1:57:48.160]  I mean, do people in Ireland see through that?
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:50.400]  No, I hate to say that.
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:53.480]  I guess I'm talking to a few people and can see it.
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:57.600]  The problem is the few that see it have no power anymore.
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:03.480]  We are controlled by communists, our leaders are total traitors, they're nations, they're
[1:58:03.480 --> 1:58:04.480]  sold out.
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:05.480]  Leftists, we are...
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:08.000]  Well, that's what it is, because if you've got an enemy like the British, you can see,
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  you can beat them.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:14.080]  But when it's this creeping political communism, it just gets your soul.
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:17.000]  And all our students have been brainwashed, I see it all the time.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:22.160]  And the media, they're not media, we only have one real channel, RT, and they are a
[1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:23.160]  hateful bunch.
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:27.960]  And we're, you know, as a Catholic, I can't go to mass now, and this, I believe, if the
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:32.080]  House Party is saying it's only a ruse to go after Christians who want to meet...
[1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:33.080]  Oh, of course it is.
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:36.480]  They want to end the Christians' meeting.
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:37.480]  That is the number one mission.
[1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:41.400]  They don't want us coming together in mass.
[1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  We must come together.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:43.400]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:44.400]  Stay with us.
[1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:45.400]  More calls.
[1:58:45.400 --> 1:58:46.400]  Thank you so much, Joseph.
[1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:56.760]  Info Wars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance
[1:58:56.760 --> 1:58:58.080]  against tyranny.
[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:03.600]  You built Info Wars, you spread the word, you prayed for us, you bought the products,
[1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:08.720]  you called in, you made recommendations, Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine.
[1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:13.200]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC
[1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:18.760]  lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we become stronger with banned.video, redesigned
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:25.120]  Info Wars, with all of our great crew, with documentary films and ten hours of live radio
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:29.120]  and TV a day, we are the resistance, you are the resistance.
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:34.480]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about
[1:59:34.480 --> 1:59:38.720]  it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[1:59:38.720 --> 1:59:43.000]  It's not just a national treasure, it's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.840]  they know it and they can't stand it.
[1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:48.480]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:49.480]  So I salute you all.
[1:59:49.480 --> 2:00:00.960]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:05.280]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:06.280]  one.
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:26.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:37.080]  It's game time, election 2020.
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:42.640]  He is a criminal, he's a criminal, he got caught, read his laptop, and you know who's
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:45.440]  a criminal, you're a criminal for not reporting it.
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:51.120]  You are a criminal for not reporting it, let me tell you something, Joe Biden is a criminal
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:55.680]  and he's been a criminal for a long time and you're a criminal in the media for not reporting
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:00:56.680]  it.
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:00:57.680]  Thank you, everybody.
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:00:59.320]  Have a good time.
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:08.960]  I probably have watched that clip 45 times, this happened three, four days ago, we played
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:13.340]  it three or four times that day, then I watched it's just something, I mean, Trump's totally
[2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:21.000]  for real folks and that's what hit me is in the Holy Spirit is I should stop being so
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:25.480]  judgmental and not believing that there's good in the world when there is.
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:28.760]  There's evil and there's good and you heard a caller earlier, a nice lady called in, I
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:34.480]  think it was from Colorado and she said, you know, God chooses imperfect men every time
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:36.240]  to lead the fight against Satan.
[2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:44.480]  Well, all men are imperfect, all women are imperfect, but God chooses big personalities.
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:49.400]  So if somebody's got a big personality, they're going to have a really big good side and they're
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:53.240]  going to have a big bad side, even though the bad side's way smaller than their good
[2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:59.400]  side, this is a key metaphysical rule, I don't go back to your calls, but this is big.
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:02.680]  If you understand this, you understand everything.
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:06.680]  Your intention is what rules you and what your will is and what you're pointed towards
[2:02:06.680 --> 2:02:11.840]  and what you want to serve and what you believe in and what you aspire to, what you really
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:16.000]  serve like Bob Dylan says, you got to serve something.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:21.400]  And so these Satanists have these little souls and most of it's evil, but they're always
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:26.440]  trying to get power and money and control because they feel small, whereas somebody
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:31.120]  that's good has this big, huge, good side and all this understanding, but because that's
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:38.560]  so big, we got this evil side over here that's way bigger than the, I mean, I mean, my evil
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:42.480]  side, if I look into it and actually use it, I mean, it's worse than anything the enemy's
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:43.480]  got.
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:44.480]  I'm actually really ashamed of that.
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:45.480]  It's something I'm bragging about.
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:47.600]  I mean, it's like, it's why I know who they are.
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:48.600]  I know how to track them.
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:52.080]  I know how to, I know how they operate because I can, I don't want to, but I got to look
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:58.840]  in there and oh boy, yeah, that's how I know what the enemy's up to and they actually,
[2:02:58.840 --> 2:02:59.840]  they envy that.
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:00.840]  See, they, they want that.
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:07.280]  I mean, you, Trump's got a huge evil caboose, but a big loving Christ like engine on the
[2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:11.840]  front that loves God, loves justice, wants freedom, doesn't want to be pushed around,
[2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:16.160]  doesn't want to be a slave, doesn't want to control you, wants freedom, wants free will.
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:23.040]  It's big, but it's so big, man, that devil he's got on his shoulder, it's big too.
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:27.720]  Not as big as him, not as big as the influence of God, but he's got a big ass devil.
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:28.720]  So do I.
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:34.960]  And that's why the Satanists all then hate us so much because we've got big aspects.
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:35.960]  So do you.
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:36.960]  That's why you're tuned in.
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:37.960]  Literally, you care.
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:40.640]  You're drawn here.
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:43.760]  We've got a big aspect.
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:47.040]  And so it's not just that God chooses flawed men.
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:48.040]  All men are flawed.
[2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:49.240]  All of us fall short.
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:50.240]  All of us are falling.
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:52.280]  We have, we have that devil side.
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:56.280]  We have that, that, that fallen nature.
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:58.440]  But I want away from that as much as I can.
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:03:59.640]  I can't stand it.
[2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:00.920]  I don't like it.
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:08.720]  And I just marvel at God and just want to know God and, and just him so thankful.
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:14.080]  Because the Satanists are killing kids and drinking blood and poisoning food supplies
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:20.740]  to try to like up this, up this thing, like get more evil, get more powerful.
[2:04:20.740 --> 2:04:26.800]  It's like this little shriveled, you know, chicken neck creature that has a zombie and
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:29.240]  they're trying to give it blood transfusions.
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:34.480]  That's what they're, I mean, literally they're over here worshiping this, this, this fallen
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:39.360]  thing, hoping they can pump it up because they have been captured by it.
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:44.560]  They don't want to turn their will over to God.
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:46.480]  And so the lady was, what she said is true.
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:49.440]  God uses flawed men because that's the only kind of men there are.
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:52.400]  But it's not like God goes out and chooses flawed men.
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:56.880]  God chooses people with big personalities that are strong and that can take it and they
[2:04:56.880 --> 2:05:02.560]  could face it and can deal with it and aren't victims, but are overcomers.
[2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:06.960]  And that means men that are willing to lose, men that are willing to be tortured.
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:07.960]  Look at Christ.
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:10.920]  That was God and man's skin doing that.
[2:05:10.920 --> 2:05:13.960]  Look like a big loser getting tortured, getting hauled up there, but knowing there's a bigger
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:15.080]  victory coming.
[2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:18.560]  That takes a real man.
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:20.560]  Think about that.
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:22.920]  See that's what it's really all about.
[2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:27.000]  It's not thinking one dimensionally about do I get worshiped right now and told how great
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:32.920]  I am or do I really do something big that changes things forever?
[2:05:32.920 --> 2:05:34.120]  That's the Godly aspect.
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:41.800]  It's multi-dimensional and expansive and works and waves go out and hit and come back better
[2:05:41.800 --> 2:05:43.680]  and better and better.
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:44.680]  See how that works?
[2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:48.480]  With God's system, things go out and they come back and it just gets beautiful and it
[2:05:48.480 --> 2:05:52.120]  gets more powerful and it makes, it's just like, oh my God, this is so good.
[2:05:52.120 --> 2:05:54.720]  People go, wait a minute, I didn't make this.
[2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:57.520]  I want control of what this is.
[2:05:57.520 --> 2:05:59.240]  I want to run this.
[2:05:59.240 --> 2:06:00.240]  You can't run it.
[2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:01.320]  You're not God.
[2:06:01.320 --> 2:06:03.160]  You need to submit to it.
[2:06:03.160 --> 2:06:04.800]  No, I'm ranting here.
[2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:07.200]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:11.840]  Head of James O'Keeffe popping in, but that's really what it is.
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:14.840]  So God doesn't choose flawed men.
[2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:18.120]  That's all there is is flawed men.
[2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:23.480]  And that's what it comes down to.
[2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:28.640]  Because there are people that are meek and there are people that want to roll over.
[2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:31.360]  You know, you read the Bible, it's all really a riddle.
[2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:32.840]  It's like the meek will inherit the earth.
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:36.560]  Because all the warriors are going to get killed, protection your ass, which is fine.
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:39.160]  It's not supposed to work.
[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:43.800]  But it's going to be warriors that will deliver you the earth.
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:47.720]  And that's what this is all about.
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:51.280]  We'll deliver it so you've got it and just remember it.
[2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:54.640]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:58.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dun-dun-dun is one of the longest here.
[2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:02.360]  That would be Jessica in the great state of Florida, probably the deciding state in the
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:03.360]  election.
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:04.360]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:06.120]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[2:07:06.120 --> 2:07:08.240]  I'm actually in Key West, Florida.
[2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:11.800]  We were one of the strictest places with our mask laws.
[2:07:11.800 --> 2:07:16.080]  Our mayor is quite something to be seen.
[2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:22.040]  You could not walk out of your home without a mask on or you'd be considered, you know,
[2:07:22.040 --> 2:07:24.560]  breaking their law.
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:29.960]  We have a doctor down here, which is amazing, Dr. Bruce Boros, who's done a lot of research
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:32.440]  on ivermectin.
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:35.480]  He's got a hundred percent success rate right now.
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:41.000]  We've also got our resident doctor at the hospital, whose wife actually works for Debbie
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  Mercersell Powell, and everybody that has died here in Key West has been under his care.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:55.360]  And Dr. Boros had a patient at the hospital the same day that Norris had a new patient
[2:07:55.360 --> 2:08:00.280]  go in and they were both treating their patients and Dr. Boros was watching, you know, how
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:05.480]  his patient was being treated and the different medications and realized he wasn't getting
[2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:13.000]  anything, but vitamin C, vitamin V zinc, there's actually a YouTube video on it where the doctor
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  and the patient get up and speak about what their experience was.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:23.480]  But Dr. Boros, he's posting even on Facebook that he's being contacted by multiple sources
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:24.480]  all over.
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:28.480]  We're just so blessed here in Key West to have a doctor like that.
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:34.840]  On top of it, I have a sister-in-law that works at the nursing home in Kansas where
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:39.600]  Fox News actually was talking about the New York nursing homes and mentioned really quickly
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:45.520]  that there was a Kansas nursing home where everybody in there had COVID and they had
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:46.520]  10 deaths.
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:52.200]  Well, I happened to just take the clip and I texted it to my sister-in-law and it come
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:54.000]  to find out it's her nursing home.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:58.840]  She just had COVID the last two weeks, she's back at work and everybody there has it.
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:01.600]  She said, yeah, the count is now up to 13.
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:07.640]  She said she's broken down four different times, so upset, and it came down to, I guess,
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:12.600]  a director of nursing that just chose not to go into work that day, called another employee
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:14.360]  and said, you have to go in.
[2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:20.240]  She happened to have been exposed to COVID, went into the nursing home, and it spread
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:21.240]  like wildfire.
[2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:22.240]  And I guess-
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:23.800]  And again, why is it killing them?
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:29.000]  Because they're in the dark not getting vitamin D3, their guts are old and they're not absorbing
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  it.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  Amazing call, Jessica.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:36.120]  All right, now I'm going to go really fast to break, and when I come back, I'm doing
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:37.120]  it.
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:38.120]  I'm taking five calls next segment.
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:39.120]  How did James O'Keefe?
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:40.120]  And I want to back your calls.
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:44.120]  We are 11 days off from the election, it could not be a more exciting time, whew!
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:10:13.960]  Whatever happens, it's in God's hands, stay with us.
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:22.800]  The power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:27.280]  Trump has finally figured this out, since he's going to take action once re-elected against
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:28.280]  big tech.
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:32.480]  Well, we know the president is overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:33.480]  cry because he has taken action.
[2:10:33.480 --> 2:10:37.580]  We, the people, are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing
[2:10:37.580 --> 2:10:40.380]  for the 2020ElectionCenter.com, for the 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[2:10:40.380 --> 2:10:43.540]  and checking out the new, redesigned, infowars.com
[2:10:43.540 --> 2:10:44.500]  and share them that way.
[2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:47.340]  Hope that really upsets them, oh yeah.
[2:10:47.340 --> 2:10:48.780]  As I take this announcement,
[2:10:48.780 --> 2:10:52.300]  we were exactly 14 days out from the election.
[2:10:52.300 --> 2:10:54.420]  And the globalist-controlled Democrats
[2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:56.220]  know that America has woken up to them
[2:10:56.220 --> 2:10:57.220]  and turned against them.
[2:10:57.220 --> 2:11:00.380]  But the whole planet is in a huge, populist realignment.
[2:11:00.380 --> 2:11:01.980]  And so they've openly said,
[2:11:01.980 --> 2:11:04.380]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism,
[2:11:04.380 --> 2:11:06.980]  not just censorship, but physically attacking
[2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:10.780]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[2:11:10.780 --> 2:11:13.420]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump,
[2:11:13.420 --> 2:11:16.300]  they are going to persecute Trump's base
[2:11:16.300 --> 2:11:17.940]  and going to try to prosecute us
[2:11:17.940 --> 2:11:19.740]  and put us all in prison.
[2:11:19.740 --> 2:11:22.900]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying.
[2:11:22.900 --> 2:11:25.140]  It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:26.580]  It's what Keith Overman's saying.
[2:11:26.580 --> 2:11:28.140]  It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[2:11:29.140 --> 2:11:33.380]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[2:11:33.380 --> 2:11:35.780]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever
[2:11:35.780 --> 2:11:36.940]  in forced inoculations.
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:38.740]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns
[2:11:38.740 --> 2:11:41.500]  and the sick vaccines will be voluntary.
[2:11:41.500 --> 2:11:43.340]  Donald Trump or die.
[2:11:43.340 --> 2:11:44.580]  We've got to get Trump in.
[2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:45.980]  Everybody get out there and vote
[2:11:45.980 --> 2:11:47.580]  and tell your family to vote now.
[2:11:50.540 --> 2:11:53.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:12:00.460 --> 2:12:04.300]  News, analysis, reports.
[2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:06.700]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[2:12:09.460 --> 2:12:12.620]  This is breaking Kamala Harris, Schumer,
[2:12:12.620 --> 2:12:16.340]  Cuomo and Feinstein listed as key contacts
[2:12:16.340 --> 2:12:18.420]  for Biden China joint venture.
[2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:21.620]  Take zero edge article, I'll cover that
[2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:22.980]  after James O'Keeffe leaves us
[2:12:22.980 --> 2:12:24.940]  in the final segment of this hour.
[2:12:24.940 --> 2:12:28.580]  But it's huge, we'll post that at infowars.com.
[2:12:29.500 --> 2:12:32.260]  James O'Keeffe scheduled to pop in for five, 10 minutes
[2:12:32.260 --> 2:12:33.860]  with us, he's a busy beaver.
[2:12:33.860 --> 2:12:34.940]  I don't wanna keep much of his time,
[2:12:34.940 --> 2:12:36.220]  he'll tell us what's coming next,
[2:12:36.220 --> 2:12:37.300]  he'll be popping in,
[2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:38.220]  quarterly next segment,
[2:12:38.220 --> 2:12:40.700]  I'm gonna go back to your calls right now.
[2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:41.980]  We've got the Queen of Conspiracy,
[2:12:41.980 --> 2:12:43.220]  what a cool name that is.
[2:12:43.220 --> 2:12:45.460]  We've got Steve, we've got Angela,
[2:12:45.460 --> 2:12:47.660]  we got DJ, we got Walt, we got Kathy.
[2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:50.380]  And I'm just going to folks in the order
[2:12:50.380 --> 2:12:52.260]  that their calls are received.
[2:12:52.260 --> 2:12:54.380]  And so that means DJ and then Walt.
[2:12:54.380 --> 2:12:55.980]  DJ in New York, go ahead.
[2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:00.260]  Oh, hello, Alex, my beloved brother.
[2:13:00.260 --> 2:13:03.980]  It's been a long, long winding road as a listener
[2:13:03.980 --> 2:13:06.660]  and viewer of your show.
[2:13:06.660 --> 2:13:11.140]  And I just wanted to express some things to you today
[2:13:11.140 --> 2:13:12.540]  that I think are significant.
[2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:15.540]  I appreciate so much, you're-
[2:13:15.540 --> 2:13:17.020]  Sir, I appreciate, you understand,
[2:13:17.020 --> 2:13:18.380]  you've stayed with us together
[2:13:18.380 --> 2:13:20.500]  to keep us here for this moment, you did this.
[2:13:20.500 --> 2:13:22.740]  Stop, I thank you too, you understand that?
[2:13:22.740 --> 2:13:25.580]  Literally, you guys don't get it, you did this.
[2:13:25.580 --> 2:13:27.500]  We were meant to be on the air doing this
[2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:30.500]  and you did it, you did it, thank you.
[2:13:30.500 --> 2:13:33.220]  Thank you, I know you well enough by now
[2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:34.540]  to know you don't like that stuff.
[2:13:34.540 --> 2:13:35.620]  That's not quite what I thought-
[2:13:35.620 --> 2:13:37.020]  No, no, no, no, I thought that I don't like it.
[2:13:37.020 --> 2:13:38.340]  I love you.
[2:13:38.340 --> 2:13:40.620]  It's like my heart telling me it likes me.
[2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:42.140]  Brother, we're in this together.
[2:13:42.140 --> 2:13:44.900]  Absolutely, thank you for keeping me on air.
[2:13:44.900 --> 2:13:46.060]  What I'm thanking you for
[2:13:46.060 --> 2:13:47.620]  is all the stuff you've taught me.
[2:13:47.620 --> 2:13:49.380]  I've learned so much from you.
[2:13:49.380 --> 2:13:51.460]  I really appreciate that.
[2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:55.060]  And of course, you've been a spigot
[2:13:55.060 --> 2:13:58.940]  where all the information comes to and goes out through.
[2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:01.660]  So, I'm gonna give you some information today.
[2:14:01.660 --> 2:14:03.020]  First, I wanted to start off by saying
[2:14:03.020 --> 2:14:04.940]  what I appreciate about you
[2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:09.940]  is your love of Americana and chivalry
[2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:12.980]  and those principles that made America great
[2:14:12.980 --> 2:14:14.260]  and continues to.
[2:14:14.260 --> 2:14:16.860]  And what is the centerpiece of this fight,
[2:14:16.860 --> 2:14:19.700]  the goodness of all of us that are fighting
[2:14:19.700 --> 2:14:21.540]  to see a better outcome
[2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:24.460]  than what the alternative looks like?
[2:14:24.460 --> 2:14:27.140]  Exactly, evil laughs at us for trying to hold the good.
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:30.380]  They only exist because we hold this thing together.
[2:14:30.380 --> 2:14:34.100]  Well, I also appreciate your love of discussing
[2:14:34.100 --> 2:14:36.260]  and talking about your ancestors
[2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:40.020]  and the greatness of how this country came about
[2:14:40.020 --> 2:14:42.580]  from the combined effort of all these ancestors
[2:14:42.580 --> 2:14:45.700]  and how all these ancestors are in our DNA.
[2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:49.500]  So, our dreams and everything that we feel and think
[2:14:49.500 --> 2:14:50.860]  comes from somewhere.
[2:14:50.860 --> 2:14:52.900]  We are not a product of our ancestors.
[2:14:52.900 --> 2:14:54.540]  We are our ancestors.
[2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:55.900]  That's it, that's it.
[2:14:55.900 --> 2:14:58.020]  So, I wanted your crew maybe while I'm talking
[2:14:58.020 --> 2:14:59.620]  to pull up my ancestor,
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:03.460]  which was the first one to set foot here in North America
[2:15:03.460 --> 2:15:04.980]  in 1638.
[2:15:04.980 --> 2:15:08.460]  His name is Michael Janssen Freeland with a V,
[2:15:08.460 --> 2:15:10.620]  B-R-E-E-L-A-N-D.
[2:15:10.620 --> 2:15:13.020]  Now, he was a somewhat famous guy in a day
[2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:15.940]  because the governor of New York,
[2:15:15.940 --> 2:15:20.940]  the Amsterdam loyalist governor here
[2:15:20.940 --> 2:15:23.060]  appointed nine men.
[2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:24.420]  They were known as nine men.
[2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:27.500]  And my grandfather was one of nine men.
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:30.100]  His 12 generations removed from me.
[2:15:30.940 --> 2:15:34.940]  And there's an etching, a picture of him.
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:37.740]  And the story on the internet of him is amazing
[2:15:37.740 --> 2:15:40.100]  because he befriended the natives.
[2:15:40.100 --> 2:15:43.900]  He bought his land just over the river from Manhattan
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:46.900]  from the natives and he made a farm.
[2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:48.940]  He came here as a farmer.
[2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:51.660]  He's the guy that bought it, bought it with a glass bead.
[2:15:51.660 --> 2:15:53.220]  Wampum?
[2:15:53.220 --> 2:15:55.460]  Well, no, that was, that was Manhattan.
[2:15:55.460 --> 2:15:58.460]  He did some other kind of trade with guilders,
[2:15:58.460 --> 2:16:00.740]  which was the currency in the day.
[2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:04.020]  So, you know, he was a farmer.
[2:16:04.020 --> 2:16:06.100]  I have farming in my blood like you do.
[2:16:06.100 --> 2:16:08.260]  And I desired to go back to that.
[2:16:09.540 --> 2:16:14.540]  Now, he was a very respected man by the Indians.
[2:16:14.860 --> 2:16:18.620]  And he was actually involved also in fur trading with them.
[2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:21.980]  And it was very popular thing to send beaver skins back there.
[2:16:21.980 --> 2:16:23.620]  Well, I'm gonna start sending him, brother.
[2:16:23.620 --> 2:16:24.940]  That's very interesting.
[2:16:24.940 --> 2:16:26.580]  Yeah, and Michael Janssen Freeland.
[2:16:26.580 --> 2:16:31.580]  And the Indians had a war in 1646.
[2:16:32.460 --> 2:16:35.940]  And the chiefs put the word out
[2:16:35.940 --> 2:16:38.740]  when they burned all the settlements there
[2:16:38.740 --> 2:16:41.900]  that they should not harm Michael Janssen Freeland
[2:16:41.900 --> 2:16:42.780]  or his family.
[2:16:42.780 --> 2:16:45.300]  And so that's why I'm able to talk to you today.
[2:16:45.300 --> 2:16:47.140]  Yeah, we're pulling this up.
[2:16:47.140 --> 2:16:50.020]  By the way, do you know who created Info Wars?
[2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:52.820]  No, it was just you.
[2:16:52.820 --> 2:16:55.340]  No, it was not, it was not.
[2:16:55.340 --> 2:17:00.340]  Vic Vreeland was a Air Force intelligence guy
[2:17:00.780 --> 2:17:02.820]  and then the deputy fire chief of Austin
[2:17:02.820 --> 2:17:03.660]  and a big listener.
[2:17:03.660 --> 2:17:05.380]  And I was over at his house one night drinking beer
[2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:07.220]  in like 1996.
[2:17:07.220 --> 2:17:08.860]  And we were, he said, you need a website.
[2:17:08.860 --> 2:17:10.420]  We need to launch one.
[2:17:10.420 --> 2:17:11.620]  And I said, I don't know the name.
[2:17:11.620 --> 2:17:13.420]  He goes, will you do information warfare?
[2:17:13.420 --> 2:17:14.900]  He goes, let's name it Info Wars.
[2:17:14.900 --> 2:17:16.900]  And a Vic Vreeland, you might be,
[2:17:16.900 --> 2:17:18.300]  he says he's too old to come on the show.
[2:17:18.300 --> 2:17:19.340]  He lives out in Bastrop.
[2:17:19.340 --> 2:17:20.780]  And I reached out to him a year ago.
[2:17:20.780 --> 2:17:21.620]  He wouldn't come on.
[2:17:21.620 --> 2:17:23.020]  I love Vic Vreeland.
[2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:25.340]  But I mean, my God, that was 27 years ago.
[2:17:25.340 --> 2:17:26.380]  He must be super old now.
[2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:27.740]  He was old then.
[2:17:27.740 --> 2:17:29.700]  But it's Vic Vreeland.
[2:17:29.700 --> 2:17:31.700]  I said, I gotta go and I love you, brother.
[2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:32.540]  Thank you so much.
[2:17:32.540 --> 2:17:33.380]  I gotta get to other people.
[2:17:33.380 --> 2:17:34.220]  We spent, I love you.
[2:17:34.220 --> 2:17:36.500]  But it's just funny to say the Vreeland's the ancestor
[2:17:36.500 --> 2:17:38.300]  and it was Vic Vreeland.
[2:17:39.420 --> 2:17:41.420]  Vic Vreeland that created Info Wars.
[2:17:41.420 --> 2:17:44.020]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:45.700]  It's a Dutch name, isn't it?
[2:17:45.700 --> 2:17:47.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to,
[2:17:47.180 --> 2:17:49.980]  who's the oldest, the longest holding now here?
[2:17:51.860 --> 2:17:52.860]  Walt in New York.
[2:17:52.860 --> 2:17:53.700]  Go ahead, Walt.
[2:17:53.700 --> 2:17:55.100]  Thanks for holding.
[2:17:55.100 --> 2:17:56.220]  Alex, are you there?
[2:17:56.220 --> 2:17:57.060]  Yes, sir.
[2:17:57.060 --> 2:17:57.900]  Thanks for holding.
[2:17:57.900 --> 2:17:59.020]  Alex, I don't know if I can keep up with you.
[2:17:59.020 --> 2:18:00.820]  I'm an old man and you're like,
[2:18:00.820 --> 2:18:02.620]  I don't want cylinders today.
[2:18:02.620 --> 2:18:04.100]  But let me say this, you know,
[2:18:04.100 --> 2:18:06.060]  in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[2:18:06.060 --> 2:18:07.780]  and the night before the crucifixion,
[2:18:07.780 --> 2:18:09.420]  Jesus was sitting there
[2:18:09.420 --> 2:18:11.020]  and the disciples were falling asleep.
[2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:12.900]  He says, you can't even keep awake.
[2:18:12.900 --> 2:18:15.260]  I mean, these are the highest people
[2:18:15.260 --> 2:18:17.380]  and they can't even stay awake.
[2:18:17.380 --> 2:18:20.220]  And, you know, Martin Luther King said,
[2:18:20.220 --> 2:18:24.100]  injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.
[2:18:24.100 --> 2:18:24.940]  Yes.
[2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:26.060]  So when Jesus was on the cross,
[2:18:26.060 --> 2:18:29.100]  what is the greater injustice than that?
[2:18:29.100 --> 2:18:33.660]  And right now, we're joining a sange in prison for what?
[2:18:33.660 --> 2:18:34.500]  For freedom of speech?
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:38.580]  He is literally on a cross in Salterg and Fima for eight years.
[2:18:39.860 --> 2:18:40.700]  That's right.
[2:18:40.700 --> 2:18:42.980]  And it's being ignored.
[2:18:42.980 --> 2:18:46.020]  I think President Trump should get on this right now,
[2:18:46.020 --> 2:18:48.220]  a big October surprise,
[2:18:48.220 --> 2:18:50.700]  and don't get down in the mud with these people.
[2:18:50.700 --> 2:18:51.820]  They're down in the mud.
[2:18:51.820 --> 2:18:52.860]  Go to the higher level.
[2:18:52.860 --> 2:18:54.020]  I totally agree.
[2:18:54.020 --> 2:18:57.180]  Trump will win if he releases Julien Assange.
[2:18:57.180 --> 2:19:00.740]  God wants him to order Julien Assange released.
[2:19:00.740 --> 2:19:04.100]  You know, we're all made in the image and license of God.
[2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:07.420]  And even if we're ordinary everyday people
[2:19:07.420 --> 2:19:08.420]  and these globalists,
[2:19:08.420 --> 2:19:11.500]  they don't think that the common man is worth anything.
[2:19:11.500 --> 2:19:13.620]  But it's the creation of the Creator.
[2:19:13.620 --> 2:19:15.460]  This is the Lord's play.
[2:19:15.460 --> 2:19:17.060]  And he made this beautiful universe.
[2:19:17.060 --> 2:19:18.340]  He made all these animals.
[2:19:18.340 --> 2:19:22.380]  He made the trees, and the grass, and the sky, and us.
[2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:24.620]  And we can use our minds for good.
[2:19:24.620 --> 2:19:25.940]  And we must recognize that
[2:19:25.940 --> 2:19:27.420]  and realize that God's the boss.
[2:19:27.420 --> 2:19:28.900]  And then follow God's directives
[2:19:28.900 --> 2:19:31.060]  and all we have is success.
[2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:33.380]  But we have to tune in to the Holy Spirit.
[2:19:33.380 --> 2:19:36.020]  That's the form that God lets us know he's here.
[2:19:36.020 --> 2:19:37.020]  So we have to try.
[2:19:37.020 --> 2:19:40.060]  And we have to go in silence and prayer at night
[2:19:40.060 --> 2:19:42.780]  when we're alone, go deep, go inside,
[2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:45.380]  and find what is your message to me, God?
[2:19:45.380 --> 2:19:46.540]  What would you like me to say?
[2:19:46.540 --> 2:19:48.220]  What would you like me to do?
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:51.140]  And we'll win this thing.
[2:19:51.140 --> 2:19:53.340]  God will win this thing for us.
[2:19:53.340 --> 2:19:54.700]  Well, all the callers are saying this.
[2:19:54.700 --> 2:19:57.620]  I literally this morning woke up from a dream of God saying,
[2:19:57.620 --> 2:19:59.660]  seek my face, tell people to pray,
[2:19:59.660 --> 2:20:01.260]  tell people to call out for me.
[2:20:01.260 --> 2:20:03.020]  You have to open the channel up.
[2:20:03.020 --> 2:20:05.100]  And I think that's the message we hear today, isn't it?
[2:20:05.100 --> 2:20:06.700]  God's in control.
[2:20:06.700 --> 2:20:07.860]  We open things up to God.
[2:20:07.860 --> 2:20:09.660]  We pray to God for real.
[2:20:09.660 --> 2:20:12.140]  That's what's going to fix this.
[2:20:12.140 --> 2:20:13.180]  This is the big one.
[2:20:13.180 --> 2:20:14.300]  This is the big one, Alex.
[2:20:14.300 --> 2:20:16.140]  And you've been saying it all along.
[2:20:16.140 --> 2:20:18.260]  It's now or never for humanity.
[2:20:18.260 --> 2:20:19.940]  It's going to be the whole planet.
[2:20:19.940 --> 2:20:21.060]  That's what's at stake.
[2:20:21.060 --> 2:20:23.620]  And everything in God's creation is at stake.
[2:20:23.620 --> 2:20:26.460]  So if we want to defend that, we need to go deep.
[2:20:26.460 --> 2:20:28.100]  We need to find the Holy Spirit.
[2:20:28.100 --> 2:20:30.660]  And we need to go to the highest point
[2:20:30.660 --> 2:20:33.620]  and advise the president to free Julian Assange.
[2:20:33.620 --> 2:20:34.580]  I think that will be a...
[2:20:34.580 --> 2:20:36.580]  Agri, and Trump needs to pray on area.
[2:20:36.580 --> 2:20:38.940]  He needs to come out and call on God's blessing.
[2:20:38.940 --> 2:20:40.700]  He needs to pray openly himself.
[2:20:40.700 --> 2:20:41.540]  Hold your eyes back.
[2:20:41.540 --> 2:20:42.540]  Thank you so much, Walt.
[2:20:45.980 --> 2:20:50.620]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra-12 are now back in stock
[2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:52.140]  after being sold out for months.
[2:20:52.140 --> 2:20:54.700]  They're sold out because people know that high-quality B12
[2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:57.660]  and a good mix of vitamins, minerals, especially zinc,
[2:20:57.660 --> 2:20:59.980]  boost your body's natural defenses
[2:20:59.980 --> 2:21:02.140]  and are critical to your immune system.
[2:21:02.140 --> 2:21:05.420]  Well, both products are back in stock
[2:21:05.420 --> 2:21:08.580]  at infowarstore.com just two weeks after the election.
[2:21:08.580 --> 2:21:11.780]  And we're offering them both at 50% off,
[2:21:11.780 --> 2:21:14.220]  free shipping and triple-patriot points
[2:21:14.220 --> 2:21:15.260]  to your next order.
[2:21:15.260 --> 2:21:17.260]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping,
[2:21:17.260 --> 2:21:18.780]  an additional 10% off.
[2:21:18.780 --> 2:21:21.340]  That makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders.
[2:21:21.340 --> 2:21:23.180]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going.
[2:21:23.180 --> 2:21:24.740]  So a lot of stuff sold out.
[2:21:24.740 --> 2:21:26.620]  A lot of the other stuff is close to selling out.
[2:21:26.620 --> 2:21:28.380]  But some of our best sellers are still there.
[2:21:28.380 --> 2:21:30.780]  And some of them have actually come back in to stock.
[2:21:30.780 --> 2:21:31.820]  And because of your support,
[2:21:31.820 --> 2:21:33.820]  we've had the money to reorder
[2:21:33.820 --> 2:21:35.940]  and get the other things that have actually sold out.
[2:21:35.940 --> 2:21:37.900]  So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[2:21:37.900 --> 2:21:40.420]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the year.
[2:21:40.420 --> 2:21:42.060]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight
[2:21:42.060 --> 2:21:44.660]  and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[2:21:46.540 --> 2:21:50.020]  In fiction, super villains are known as super villains
[2:21:50.020 --> 2:21:54.340]  because they have gigantic, huge, global plants
[2:21:54.340 --> 2:21:56.020]  that are incredibly well thought out
[2:21:56.020 --> 2:21:57.580]  and incredibly complex.
[2:21:57.580 --> 2:21:58.860]  And they might have told you a year ago,
[2:21:58.860 --> 2:22:01.100]  back in October of 2019,
[2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:03.900]  that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN
[2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:06.180]  would roll out a global hysteria
[2:22:06.180 --> 2:22:08.700]  and lock down the planet, start millions of people
[2:22:08.700 --> 2:22:11.100]  and would be pushing a forced inoculation
[2:22:11.100 --> 2:22:13.020]  to even be able to leave your houses
[2:22:13.020 --> 2:22:14.660]  and that this same billionaire would say,
[2:22:14.660 --> 2:22:16.180]  we're all gonna work from home now
[2:22:16.180 --> 2:22:19.660]  and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint
[2:22:19.660 --> 2:22:21.340]  and the human population.
[2:22:21.340 --> 2:22:22.460]  You tell me that's crazy.
[2:22:22.460 --> 2:22:23.900]  You tell me that's a dystopia.
[2:22:23.900 --> 2:22:27.620]  You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book.
[2:22:27.620 --> 2:22:29.540]  But in reality, it really did happen.
[2:22:29.540 --> 2:22:30.740]  His name is Bill Gates
[2:22:30.740 --> 2:22:34.180]  and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium
[2:22:34.180 --> 2:22:38.100]  that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[2:22:38.100 --> 2:22:40.660]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[2:22:40.660 --> 2:22:43.380]  Until we start saying, no, we are Bill Gates's property.
[2:22:43.380 --> 2:22:45.500]  It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[2:22:45.500 --> 2:22:50.100]  Introducing, in full war's life, pure turmeric extract.
[2:22:50.100 --> 2:22:52.580]  This is taken under the tongue.
[2:22:52.580 --> 2:22:54.780]  It is pure turmeric.
[2:22:54.780 --> 2:22:56.380]  It goes together very well
[2:22:56.380 --> 2:22:59.060]  with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:22:59.060 --> 2:23:01.180]  that is taken as a powdered capsule
[2:23:01.180 --> 2:23:03.980]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[2:23:03.980 --> 2:23:07.060]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream
[2:23:07.060 --> 2:23:09.860]  and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[2:23:09.860 --> 2:23:12.460]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[2:23:12.460 --> 2:23:15.700]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates
[2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:17.540]  and our first product got rave reviews.
[2:23:17.540 --> 2:23:19.620]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[2:23:19.620 --> 2:23:21.740]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:23.180]  Some like bodies better.
[2:23:23.180 --> 2:23:24.940]  For me, they're both amazing
[2:23:24.940 --> 2:23:27.300]  for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more
[2:23:27.300 --> 2:23:28.500]  and they fund the info war.
[2:23:28.500 --> 2:23:31.940]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively
[2:23:31.940 --> 2:23:34.740]  at mforestore.com today, an additional 25% off.
[2:23:34.740 --> 2:23:37.660]  This is a 360 win.
[2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.900]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies,
[2:23:40.900 --> 2:23:42.740]  for inflammation and so much more.
[2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:45.340]  Get yours today at mforeslife.com.
[2:23:45.340 --> 2:24:04.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:04.860 --> 2:24:07.100]  Without James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[2:24:07.100 --> 2:24:11.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:11.700 --> 2:24:14.300]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:24:14.300 --> 2:24:17.980]  Without James O'Keefe and Project Veritas,
[2:24:17.980 --> 2:24:21.980]  President Trump would not have gotten elected four years ago.
[2:24:21.980 --> 2:24:24.220]  And always up in the ante,
[2:24:24.220 --> 2:24:26.140]  they have broken so many bombshell reports
[2:24:26.140 --> 2:24:27.420]  in the last three, four days.
[2:24:27.420 --> 2:24:28.900]  I can't even keep track of it.
[2:24:28.900 --> 2:24:32.060]  I've seen five big ones myself with whistleblower
[2:24:32.060 --> 2:24:36.620]  after whistleblower admitting that Google is openly
[2:24:36.620 --> 2:24:38.820]  skewing the election with search results
[2:24:38.820 --> 2:24:40.740]  and other systems for Joe Biden.
[2:24:40.740 --> 2:24:43.500]  So in the one segment we have, the nine minutes we have,
[2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:46.460]  James O'Keefe, you've got the floor, Project Veritas.
[2:24:46.460 --> 2:24:49.020]  Tell us what's happening, what you've broken,
[2:24:49.020 --> 2:24:51.780]  what people should share and be informed about
[2:24:51.780 --> 2:24:53.340]  and then what's coming next.
[2:24:53.340 --> 2:24:54.620]  Thank you so much.
[2:24:54.620 --> 2:24:55.780]  Hey Alex, great to be with you.
[2:24:55.780 --> 2:24:58.300]  We just broke about three videos on Google,
[2:24:58.300 --> 2:25:02.060]  various engineers inside Google talking about bias,
[2:25:02.060 --> 2:25:05.660]  a technical program manager in the cloud inside Google
[2:25:05.660 --> 2:25:09.180]  saying that they use algorithms in a biased fashion
[2:25:09.180 --> 2:25:10.860]  to help Joe Biden.
[2:25:10.860 --> 2:25:13.100]  This guy talks about how they take only disinformation
[2:25:13.100 --> 2:25:15.980]  off Google in one political spectrum.
[2:25:15.980 --> 2:25:20.980]  You can delete misinformation when it comes to Joe Biden
[2:25:20.980 --> 2:25:22.580]  but not when it comes to Melania Trump.
[2:25:22.580 --> 2:25:24.460]  We have another guy, Adriano Amadouzi
[2:25:24.460 --> 2:25:26.940]  who's a Google ad executive on tape this week.
[2:25:26.940 --> 2:25:29.740]  He says they offer free advertising credits to Democrats.
[2:25:29.740 --> 2:25:31.260]  This is on the video tape.
[2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:33.380]  And he says you can censor out information
[2:25:33.380 --> 2:25:37.420]  from your search engine in order to help the Democratic Party
[2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:40.380]  and finally Ashwin Agrawal,
[2:25:40.380 --> 2:25:42.780]  head of global competitive analysis in Google Cloud.
[2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:46.740]  He's on hidden camera saying the platform is influencing you
[2:25:46.740 --> 2:25:48.140]  and you don't even know it
[2:25:48.140 --> 2:25:52.020]  and you see more Democratic advertising content
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:54.220]  than you see Republican content.
[2:25:54.220 --> 2:25:56.740]  Quote, the truth is that it's a deep platform
[2:25:56.740 --> 2:25:58.820]  is influencing you way you did not sign up for.
[2:25:58.820 --> 2:26:00.780]  So these guys, Alex, are kind of,
[2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:02.020]  they're not necessarily villains
[2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:03.540]  but they're people working for Google
[2:26:03.540 --> 2:26:05.820]  who are confirming suspicions,
[2:26:05.820 --> 2:26:08.220]  telling you things that don't shock you
[2:26:08.220 --> 2:26:10.220]  but certainly it's the first time we've ever seen
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:11.740]  a Google employee say these things
[2:26:11.740 --> 2:26:13.660]  and there they are on the tape.
[2:26:13.660 --> 2:26:15.780]  You could spend all the money in the world
[2:26:15.780 --> 2:26:18.660]  buying ads on TV but if Google,
[2:26:18.660 --> 2:26:20.860]  which has both a legal monopoly
[2:26:20.860 --> 2:26:23.940]  and a monopoly on ideas and information
[2:26:23.940 --> 2:26:25.020]  can do this sort of thing,
[2:26:25.020 --> 2:26:27.100]  it's very troubling in our republic.
[2:26:27.100 --> 2:26:29.820]  It's very concerning a week before the election.
[2:26:29.820 --> 2:26:33.380]  And what's incredible is they're so nonchalant about it
[2:26:33.380 --> 2:26:35.180]  because they're so arrogant.
[2:26:35.180 --> 2:26:38.020]  And if anything, you're playing down how big this is James.
[2:26:38.020 --> 2:26:39.820]  This is the biggest thing ever.
[2:26:39.820 --> 2:26:43.260]  They're saying we're fixing the search engines,
[2:26:43.260 --> 2:26:44.540]  we're fixing the results,
[2:26:44.540 --> 2:26:46.420]  we're manipulating the election,
[2:26:46.420 --> 2:26:48.100]  we're changing the outcome.
[2:26:48.100 --> 2:26:50.980]  This is all coffin nails if Congress wanted to act.
[2:26:50.980 --> 2:26:53.940]  This is all proof that Sundar Pichai
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:55.460]  and all of them lied to Congress.
[2:26:55.460 --> 2:26:57.700]  This is smoking gun.
[2:26:57.700 --> 2:26:59.220]  Yeah, this is smoking gun evidence
[2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:00.700]  and this is incontrovertible.
[2:27:00.700 --> 2:27:02.940]  And there you see one of the individuals,
[2:27:02.940 --> 2:27:05.900]  Adriano at Ad Executive at Google,
[2:27:05.900 --> 2:27:08.340]  talking about helping the Democratic Party
[2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:11.860]  through advertising, free advertising for Democrats.
[2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:14.660]  That's an FEC violation.
[2:27:14.660 --> 2:27:16.580]  I was about to say that that's the illegal
[2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:18.420]  campaign contribution, I mean.
[2:27:18.420 --> 2:27:20.140]  The campaign contribution, yes.
[2:27:20.140 --> 2:27:22.700]  Dinesh D'Souza got a few of his friends to give money.
[2:27:22.700 --> 2:27:23.780]  He went to prison.
[2:27:23.780 --> 2:27:25.100]  This is way beyond that.
[2:27:25.100 --> 2:27:27.460]  They're saying we're giving free advertising
[2:27:27.460 --> 2:27:28.660]  to Democrats in an election.
[2:27:28.660 --> 2:27:30.060]  That's a felony.
[2:27:30.060 --> 2:27:32.620]  Well, I think we're no longer a nation of laws, Alex,
[2:27:32.620 --> 2:27:34.740]  but we're a nation of political will.
[2:27:34.740 --> 2:27:36.700]  And I don't think people have the Cajones
[2:27:36.700 --> 2:27:40.060]  to take on Google because of how big and powerful they are.
[2:27:40.060 --> 2:27:42.580]  They have their tentacles everywhere in Congress
[2:27:42.580 --> 2:27:43.700]  and the White House.
[2:27:43.700 --> 2:27:47.780]  I'm not afraid of Google or any other organization.
[2:27:47.780 --> 2:27:50.260]  And by the way, these videos on Twitter,
[2:27:50.260 --> 2:27:51.700]  millions and millions of views,
[2:27:51.700 --> 2:27:52.940]  but when you go to look at them,
[2:27:52.940 --> 2:27:55.220]  it says it's sensitive content.
[2:27:55.220 --> 2:27:58.620]  So they call me a disinformation campaign
[2:27:58.620 --> 2:28:00.500]  when in fact the powers that be,
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:02.260]  the New York Times, the USA Today
[2:28:02.260 --> 2:28:04.100]  is engaged in their own disinformation
[2:28:04.100 --> 2:28:05.780]  against Project Veritas.
[2:28:05.780 --> 2:28:09.540]  This is again, straight out of George Orwell's 1984
[2:28:09.540 --> 2:28:13.260]  to call black, white to state facts
[2:28:13.260 --> 2:28:16.780]  that run contrary to facts to tamper with reality.
[2:28:16.780 --> 2:28:19.260]  But what you're looking at here is real.
[2:28:19.260 --> 2:28:20.940]  These are actual employees.
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:22.500]  They're confessing to the truth.
[2:28:22.500 --> 2:28:24.420]  Next week, they're gonna be hearings in DC,
[2:28:24.420 --> 2:28:25.860]  a Senate commerce hearing.
[2:28:25.860 --> 2:28:29.060]  I just hope that politicians have the willpower
[2:28:29.060 --> 2:28:31.700]  and the courage to play this in Congress
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:33.940]  and change and do something about it.
[2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:35.980]  Loud as I was gonna say next, the only way you'll get it
[2:28:35.980 --> 2:28:38.540]  is Congress or Trump tweets it, which he's been doing.
[2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:40.980]  Total blackout on the Hunter Biden laptop
[2:28:40.980 --> 2:28:42.180]  confirmed to be real.
[2:28:42.180 --> 2:28:44.260]  All the witnesses saying, yeah, we got the emails.
[2:28:44.260 --> 2:28:45.860]  They've got the chain confirmed.
[2:28:45.860 --> 2:28:48.820]  You're dropping, I mean, I don't go see superhero movies
[2:28:48.820 --> 2:28:50.020]  since I've got James O'Keeffe.
[2:28:50.020 --> 2:28:50.900]  And I'm not kissing your ass.
[2:28:50.900 --> 2:28:52.820]  It's true, dude, your organization,
[2:28:52.820 --> 2:28:54.980]  what your reporters do, what you do,
[2:28:54.980 --> 2:28:57.580]  you just keep upping the game to,
[2:28:57.580 --> 2:28:59.460]  like one of these stories would be bombshell.
[2:28:59.460 --> 2:29:00.540]  It's almost like too much.
[2:29:00.540 --> 2:29:02.260]  You've got like three of them today
[2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:05.380]  and five of them this week and just how, God,
[2:29:05.380 --> 2:29:07.900]  I cannot think of a better place for people
[2:29:07.900 --> 2:29:09.700]  to spread information or be supportive.
[2:29:09.700 --> 2:29:11.900]  How do people support the tip of the spear
[2:29:11.900 --> 2:29:13.580]  of Project Veritas?
[2:29:13.580 --> 2:29:14.580]  Well, the main thing they can do
[2:29:14.580 --> 2:29:16.220]  is if they're watching your program
[2:29:16.220 --> 2:29:20.660]  and they're witnessed a fraud, wherever they may be,
[2:29:20.660 --> 2:29:22.860]  Veritas tips at protonmail.com.
[2:29:22.860 --> 2:29:26.860]  That's a V-E-R-I-T-A-S tips at protonmail.com.
[2:29:26.860 --> 2:29:29.940]  You know, Alex, I'm headed to Texas.
[2:29:29.940 --> 2:29:33.340]  We have, one of our next stories is in your state of Texas,
[2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:37.900]  a massive, massive voter fraud bombshell coming out soon.
[2:29:37.900 --> 2:29:40.740]  And what you're gonna see here is an army of people.
[2:29:40.740 --> 2:29:42.780]  Alex, they can stop one man,
[2:29:42.780 --> 2:29:45.620]  but they can't stop a thousand citizens
[2:29:45.620 --> 2:29:48.300]  blowing the whistle, filming fraud and corruption.
[2:29:48.300 --> 2:29:50.660]  Yes, we get, you know, we get blacklisted
[2:29:50.660 --> 2:29:53.260]  by these major media corporations.
[2:29:53.260 --> 2:29:57.340]  But I think we're winning and that we're enlightening people
[2:29:57.340 --> 2:30:00.220]  by the millions, we're bypassing the powers that be.
[2:30:00.220 --> 2:30:01.820]  We're going straight to the consumer,
[2:30:01.820 --> 2:30:04.340]  sometimes on social media platforms,
[2:30:04.340 --> 2:30:07.820]  but people have a hunger for real visual, you know,
[2:30:07.820 --> 2:30:08.660]  information.
[2:30:08.660 --> 2:30:11.020]  So I think we're being very successful
[2:30:11.020 --> 2:30:12.700]  getting these tapes directly to people.
[2:30:12.700 --> 2:30:13.860]  And I think we're gonna build an army.
[2:30:13.860 --> 2:30:14.700]  This is a movement.
[2:30:14.700 --> 2:30:15.540]  This is a-
[2:30:15.540 --> 2:30:17.340]  Yeah, people have a hunger for truth.
[2:30:17.340 --> 2:30:20.300]  Yes, and this is a movement of whistleblowers
[2:30:20.300 --> 2:30:21.740]  that's growing, growing, growing.
[2:30:21.740 --> 2:30:22.580]  Same thing.
[2:30:22.580 --> 2:30:23.780]  I've been contacted and confirmed
[2:30:23.780 --> 2:30:25.820]  from law enforcement, you name it.
[2:30:25.820 --> 2:30:28.140]  People inside nursing homes in Texas
[2:30:28.140 --> 2:30:29.940]  where all the Democrat registered people
[2:30:29.940 --> 2:30:31.420]  are getting a bunch of ballots.
[2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:33.060]  Then they're all scared though to show it to me
[2:30:33.060 --> 2:30:34.340]  though we've confirmed it.
[2:30:34.340 --> 2:30:35.700]  So I'm sure you already know about that,
[2:30:35.700 --> 2:30:36.740]  but I mean, I bet you're,
[2:30:36.740 --> 2:30:38.220]  how do you deal with the flood?
[2:30:38.220 --> 2:30:40.340]  You're just a flood of Democrat fraud.
[2:30:40.340 --> 2:30:41.900]  I mean, if Republicans were involved in fraud,
[2:30:41.900 --> 2:30:42.740]  I'd expose it.
[2:30:42.740 --> 2:30:43.580]  I never see them do that.
[2:30:43.580 --> 2:30:44.660]  I have something that's been a tape
[2:30:44.660 --> 2:30:46.340]  of a Republican ripping up a ballot.
[2:30:46.340 --> 2:30:48.820]  I'm publishing that story right here, right now.
[2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:51.580]  I mean, I have a lot of tips, a lot of sources,
[2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:52.900]  even in Texas.
[2:30:52.900 --> 2:30:55.140]  And these people are filling out ballots for other people.
[2:30:55.140 --> 2:30:56.260]  They're breaking the law.
[2:30:56.260 --> 2:30:57.300]  We have them on tape.
[2:30:57.300 --> 2:30:58.660]  That's what we're told.
[2:30:58.660 --> 2:31:00.740]  That's what we're told by all these insiders.
[2:31:00.740 --> 2:31:04.260]  And what about the footage that Yahoo News got
[2:31:05.300 --> 2:31:08.540]  inadvertently in a live feed in Germantown, Maryland
[2:31:08.540 --> 2:31:10.500]  where the guy's like filling out the ballot
[2:31:10.500 --> 2:31:11.980]  right there on camera?
[2:31:11.980 --> 2:31:14.420]  Yeah, I mean, that's what we've got that stuff.
[2:31:14.420 --> 2:31:16.300]  Alex forthcoming, we've already released
[2:31:16.300 --> 2:31:17.340]  the stuff in Minnesota.
[2:31:17.340 --> 2:31:18.180]  They attacked me.
[2:31:18.180 --> 2:31:19.220]  They said there's no evidence.
[2:31:19.220 --> 2:31:20.780]  It's unsubstantiated.
[2:31:20.780 --> 2:31:23.860]  I'm not sure what evidence you actually need to see
[2:31:23.860 --> 2:31:27.020]  other than the people on tape with all the absentee ballots
[2:31:27.020 --> 2:31:28.860]  breaking the law and ripping them up.
[2:31:28.860 --> 2:31:30.900]  But I think we have a greater problem in this country,
[2:31:30.900 --> 2:31:33.660]  which is that the only way things are gonna change
[2:31:33.660 --> 2:31:36.380]  is if ordinary people, and this is my pitch,
[2:31:36.380 --> 2:31:39.940]  just the ordinary salt of the earth guy sitting out there
[2:31:39.940 --> 2:31:41.300]  does the work themselves.
[2:31:41.300 --> 2:31:43.820]  You cannot wait for the attorney general
[2:31:43.820 --> 2:31:47.380]  or law enforcement or the FBI whose director,
[2:31:47.380 --> 2:31:49.420]  Christopher Ray said there's no such thing as voter fraud.
[2:31:49.420 --> 2:31:50.860]  I don't know, that's the irony of the director
[2:31:50.860 --> 2:31:52.140]  of the federal Bureau of Investigation
[2:31:52.140 --> 2:31:53.580]  saying there's no fraud.
[2:31:53.580 --> 2:31:55.060]  That should be self-evident.
[2:31:55.060 --> 2:31:57.220]  So you have to do the work yourself
[2:31:57.220 --> 2:31:59.420]  and get it out there directly to the people.
[2:31:59.420 --> 2:32:01.380]  And Alex, it's just gonna get bigger.
[2:32:01.380 --> 2:32:05.180]  This is a movement, I'm looking forward to the truth
[2:32:05.180 --> 2:32:07.300]  and reconciliation committees after the election.
[2:32:07.300 --> 2:32:11.540]  I'm gonna hold on to the mast and ride or die
[2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:14.220]  into the wind here and keep releasing more footage
[2:32:14.220 --> 2:32:16.260]  because there's a lot of work to be done.
[2:32:16.260 --> 2:32:18.180]  All right, join us again before the election
[2:32:18.180 --> 2:32:20.140]  and then after, but just 60 seconds on this.
[2:32:20.140 --> 2:32:22.180]  I'm friends with Joe, he's moved to Austin.
[2:32:22.180 --> 2:32:24.940]  He buys mainstream media, but it is true.
[2:32:24.940 --> 2:32:26.540]  You've never been repudiated.
[2:32:26.540 --> 2:32:27.900]  You've never been proven to be a liar.
[2:32:27.900 --> 2:32:30.700]  The media says you edit tape and you're a fraud.
[2:32:30.700 --> 2:32:32.100]  When you're the gold standard of that,
[2:32:32.100 --> 2:32:34.620]  so I'm gonna talk to Joe next week.
[2:32:34.620 --> 2:32:36.700]  I hope that he'll actually have you on
[2:32:36.700 --> 2:32:38.980]  and understand that he got conned about that.
[2:32:38.980 --> 2:32:40.140]  You talking about Joe Rogan?
[2:32:40.140 --> 2:32:41.140]  Yes.
[2:32:41.140 --> 2:32:43.340]  Yeah, I mean, I hope I'm on a show, but this and Alex,
[2:32:43.340 --> 2:32:45.780]  what they do is they use that Soviet technique
[2:32:45.780 --> 2:32:48.220]  where they project onto you what they do.
[2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:50.580]  So they accuse you of doing what they're doing.
[2:32:50.580 --> 2:32:52.820]  So when they say I'm a disinformation expert,
[2:32:52.820 --> 2:32:55.540]  the New York Times hired Stanford University researchers
[2:32:55.540 --> 2:32:57.460]  and just interviewed some idiot who said,
[2:32:57.460 --> 2:32:59.620]  oh, Keith's a disinformation expert.
[2:32:59.620 --> 2:33:02.420]  And what they do is they put out their own disinformation
[2:33:02.420 --> 2:33:03.980]  and then they call us what they do.
[2:33:03.980 --> 2:33:05.300]  So they selectively edit.
[2:33:05.300 --> 2:33:06.140]  They use it.
[2:33:06.140 --> 2:33:07.100]  Sure, they have a call to authority.
[2:33:07.100 --> 2:33:10.540]  Oh, look, this professor says James O'Keeffe's bad
[2:33:10.540 --> 2:33:13.060]  or CNN experts say Trump's a liar.
[2:33:13.060 --> 2:33:15.180]  Exactly, it's all fraud, it's incredible.
[2:33:15.180 --> 2:33:18.660]  So disinformation, we don't do what they do.
[2:33:18.660 --> 2:33:20.820]  James O'Keeffe, you got to go.
[2:33:20.820 --> 2:33:21.820]  Join us again soon.
[2:33:21.820 --> 2:33:24.380]  I know you got even more stuff about to break, right?
[2:33:24.380 --> 2:33:26.180]  Yeah, we've got videos released every day
[2:33:26.180 --> 2:33:29.300]  until the election, so we're going to keep pushing forward.
[2:33:29.300 --> 2:33:30.820]  Everybody get to Project Veritas
[2:33:30.820 --> 2:33:32.060]  and get those videos out now.
[2:33:32.060 --> 2:33:33.380]  Thank you, James O'Keeffe.
[2:33:33.380 --> 2:33:34.260]  Thank you.
[2:33:34.260 --> 2:33:35.100]  Amazing.
[2:33:35.100 --> 2:33:35.940]  We'll be right back with your call.
[2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:40.860]  Stay with us on Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com,

[2:34:40.260 --> 2:34:44.260]  Infowars.com.
[2:34:44.260 --> 2:34:46.260]  Black Friday in October.
[2:34:46.260 --> 2:34:49.260]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales
[2:34:49.260 --> 2:34:52.260]  that we ran in the last couple weeks of October.
[2:34:52.260 --> 2:34:53.260]  It was popular for a reason.
[2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:59.260]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[2:34:59.260 --> 2:35:02.260]  And that means 30% to 60% off, store-wide free shipping,

[2:35:11.260 --> 2:35:14.260]  A lot of stuff sold out, some of our best sellers are still there.
[2:35:14.260 --> 2:35:17.260]  But some good news, vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc

[2:35:41.260 --> 2:35:43.260]  Infowars.com.
[2:35:43.260 --> 2:35:46.260]  Black Friday comes in October.
[2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:52.260]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what info wars understand,
[2:35:52.260 --> 2:35:55.260]  what our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[2:35:55.260 --> 2:35:58.260]  We are in a digital civil war.
[2:35:58.260 --> 2:36:03.260]  There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on
[2:36:03.260 --> 2:36:05.260]  on every major tech platform.
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:08.260]  And now they're doing it to the private apps.
[2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:10.260]  They're doing it to text messages.
[2:36:10.260 --> 2:36:12.260]  They're doing it to email.
[2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:16.260]  They feel organized crime, election meddling.
[2:36:16.260 --> 2:36:20.260]  But finally, when they blocked 100 Biden and the barisma information
[2:36:20.260 --> 2:36:24.260]  and the Chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest of it,
[2:36:24.260 --> 2:36:26.260]  it's been confirmed to be real.
[2:36:26.260 --> 2:36:28.260]  Biden hasn't denied it.
[2:36:28.260 --> 2:36:30.260]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control.
[2:36:30.260 --> 2:36:32.260]  You've got to stop it now.
[2:36:32.260 --> 2:36:33.260]  We're taking action.
[2:36:33.260 --> 2:36:34.260]  Oh, inject worse.
[2:36:34.260 --> 2:36:35.260]  You went, oh, it's a mistake.
[2:36:35.260 --> 2:36:36.260]  It's an accident.
[2:36:36.260 --> 2:36:37.260]  It's an accident.
[2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:40.260]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff.
[2:36:40.260 --> 2:36:45.260]  And I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[2:36:45.260 --> 2:36:50.260]  COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out,
[2:36:50.260 --> 2:36:52.260]  and it's been incrementally orchestrated.
[2:36:52.260 --> 2:36:55.260]  First, it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty.
[2:36:55.260 --> 2:36:56.260]  That's all I've done.
[2:36:56.260 --> 2:36:58.260]  It's two months, and it's six months, and it's a year.
[2:36:58.260 --> 2:37:00.260]  Now Bill Gates has 10 years.
[2:37:00.260 --> 2:37:02.260]  And people are not saying, I like my mask.
[2:37:02.260 --> 2:37:03.260]  I like my face diaper.
[2:37:03.260 --> 2:37:05.260]  I like my binky.
[2:37:05.260 --> 2:37:08.260]  And so getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria,
[2:37:08.260 --> 2:37:12.260]  getting into all the exaggerated death numbers,
[2:37:12.260 --> 2:37:16.260]  this is our new neurotic control freak society,
[2:37:16.260 --> 2:37:20.260]  overseen by robots, overseen by AI.
[2:37:20.260 --> 2:37:25.260]  And all of it is designed to make humans non-essential.
[2:37:25.260 --> 2:37:29.260]  That's why out of the gates, they tell us, you are non-essential.
[2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:31.260]  You are non-essential.
[2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:37.260]  Your company, your restaurant, your job, your profession is non-essential.
[2:37:37.260 --> 2:37:40.260]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated,
[2:37:40.260 --> 2:37:42.260]  and Bill Gates sits on top of it.
[2:37:42.260 --> 2:37:44.260]  Come on, folks, let's reject this.
[2:37:48.260 --> 2:37:51.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:02.260 --> 2:38:03.260]  Black?
[2:38:03.260 --> 2:38:06.260]  Wow, I didn't even know this was a playlist.
[2:38:06.260 --> 2:38:07.260]  I love it.
[2:38:07.260 --> 2:38:09.260]  Let it roll for a minute.
[2:38:12.260 --> 2:38:14.260]  Or is this Mark Chester?
[2:38:16.260 --> 2:38:18.260]  No, it's just when black all runs together.
[2:38:18.260 --> 2:38:37.260]  I think I'm like 16 years old again.
[2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:39.260]  You know, I did, but this is the playlist a few years ago.
[2:38:39.260 --> 2:38:40.260]  No, I haven't played it.
[2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:42.260]  I guess they're getting to the playlist.
[2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:47.260]  But the idea is we're under tyranny, and things are rough.
[2:38:47.260 --> 2:38:48.260]  But we are leaving here a better man.
[2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:49.260]  Go ahead and roll it.
[2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:55.260]  I'm leaving here a better man.
[2:39:12.260 --> 2:39:16.260]  By the end, he says, things I couldn't do before.
[2:39:16.260 --> 2:39:18.260]  Now I know a key.
[2:39:18.260 --> 2:39:20.260]  That's the key.
[2:39:20.260 --> 2:39:22.260]  All right, just briefly.
[2:39:22.260 --> 2:39:25.260]  I was thinking this morning, what do I say about vitamin D?
[2:39:25.260 --> 2:39:28.260]  What do I say about vitamin C?
[2:39:28.260 --> 2:39:30.260]  What do I say about iodine?
[2:39:30.260 --> 2:39:34.260]  What do I say about zinc that are all essential to live?
[2:39:34.260 --> 2:39:37.260]  They're not weapons in our lives.
[2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:39.260]  Water is not a weapon when you drink it.
[2:39:39.260 --> 2:39:41.260]  Sunlight's not a weapon.
[2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:42.260]  Food's not a weapon.
[2:39:42.260 --> 2:39:43.260]  It's just what you do.
[2:39:43.260 --> 2:39:47.260]  And so much of it is not in the food or it's synthetic.
[2:39:47.260 --> 2:39:51.260]  And I preach to myself, when I say, if you've got the supplements,
[2:39:51.260 --> 2:39:53.260]  you better remember to take them.
[2:39:53.260 --> 2:39:55.260]  Because when I remember to take DNA force,
[2:39:55.260 --> 2:39:59.260]  when I remember to take X2, when I remember to take my winter sun,
[2:39:59.260 --> 2:40:01.260]  when I remember to take my vitamin refuges,
[2:40:01.260 --> 2:40:02.260]  there's a lot of products.
[2:40:02.260 --> 2:40:04.260]  So one day I'd mix up some punch for a few days,
[2:40:04.260 --> 2:40:06.260]  we'd drink it into the container.
[2:40:06.260 --> 2:40:08.260]  Then next I'd take some fish oil, I remember,
[2:40:08.260 --> 2:40:10.260]  and I'd just kind of graze through the stuff I've got.
[2:40:10.260 --> 2:40:12.260]  It makes my life so much better.
[2:40:12.260 --> 2:40:14.260]  And then it funds the info war.
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:17.260]  But with vitamin mineral fusion, it's going to sell out.
[2:40:17.260 --> 2:40:19.260]  We did the numbers just about an hour ago.
[2:40:19.260 --> 2:40:21.260]  I called the crew over there at the warehouse.
[2:40:21.260 --> 2:40:24.260]  It'll be sold out in nine days at current sales rates.
[2:40:24.260 --> 2:40:25.260]  People want zinc.
[2:40:25.260 --> 2:40:26.260]  They want vitamins.
[2:40:26.260 --> 2:40:27.260]  They want amino acids.
[2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:28.260]  They want the minerals.
[2:40:28.260 --> 2:40:29.260]  Everything you need in one deal.
[2:40:29.260 --> 2:40:32.260]  I'm going to keep the sell going despite the fact it's selling out.
[2:40:32.260 --> 2:40:34.260]  Ultra 12, highest quality B12.
[2:40:34.260 --> 2:40:38.260]  Selling out, free shipping, 50% off, triple page rip points,
[2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:42.260]  10% off, you sign up for auto ship, it's right there.
[2:40:42.260 --> 2:40:44.260]  We're selling out of the fish oil.
[2:40:44.260 --> 2:40:45.260]  Selling out of the krill oil.
[2:40:45.260 --> 2:40:47.260]  Still massively discounted, still free shipping,
[2:40:47.260 --> 2:40:51.260]  still triple page rip points, all of it.
[2:40:51.260 --> 2:40:52.260]  DNA forks about to sell out.
[2:40:52.260 --> 2:40:53.260]  We'll have more until December.
[2:40:53.260 --> 2:40:55.260]  We're still going to keep it discounted.
[2:40:55.260 --> 2:40:56.260]  Because I want you to get it.
[2:40:56.260 --> 2:40:58.260]  I want you to see how great it is.
[2:40:58.260 --> 2:41:01.260]  But if you're like me, you've got to remember to take it.
[2:41:01.260 --> 2:41:02.260]  infowarstore.com.
[2:41:02.260 --> 2:41:04.260]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[2:41:04.260 --> 2:41:07.260]  It's been amazing to be here in the middle of this thing.
[2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:09.260]  Thank God we're still here.
[2:41:09.260 --> 2:41:10.260]  Thank God you kept us on air.
[2:41:10.260 --> 2:41:12.260]  I mean, I just cannot thank you enough.
[2:41:12.260 --> 2:41:15.260]  It's just the enemy wants to defeat us.
[2:41:15.260 --> 2:41:17.260]  And it's not being beaten by him.
[2:41:17.260 --> 2:41:18.260]  I'm scared of.
[2:41:18.260 --> 2:41:19.260]  It's them.
[2:41:19.260 --> 2:41:21.260]  When they beat you, then they dominate you.
[2:41:21.260 --> 2:41:23.260]  That's just the beginning.
[2:41:23.260 --> 2:41:25.260]  And so thanks for keeping us the fight, getting great products,
[2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:28.260]  t-shirts, books, films, water filtration, air filtration,
[2:41:28.260 --> 2:41:32.260]  shortwave radios, combat hatchets, all sorts of cool survival gear.
[2:41:32.260 --> 2:41:33.260]  Thousands of products.
[2:41:33.260 --> 2:41:34.260]  infowarstore.com.
[2:41:34.260 --> 2:41:35.260]  Go explore it.
[2:41:35.260 --> 2:41:36.260]  Go check it out.
[2:41:36.260 --> 2:41:37.260]  Go check it out.
[2:41:37.260 --> 2:41:38.260]  Okay.
[2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:46.260]  I've got three amazing clips from Trump.
[2:41:46.260 --> 2:41:49.260]  How he taped Leslie Stahl so he can show us really set.
[2:41:49.260 --> 2:41:52.260]  Now, I wish he'd have had a better microphone because it's on the
[2:41:52.260 --> 2:41:53.260]  camera.
[2:41:53.260 --> 2:41:56.260]  So it's not the best audio, but it shows what he said versus
[2:41:56.260 --> 2:41:58.260]  what she's already put out.
[2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:00.260]  They haven't aired it yet, but they've aired clips and they're
[2:42:00.260 --> 2:42:01.260]  highly edited.
[2:42:01.260 --> 2:42:03.260]  We're going to play that next hour.
[2:42:03.260 --> 2:42:06.260]  And then our guest host will come on the last three segments the
[2:42:06.260 --> 2:42:07.260]  next hour.
[2:42:07.260 --> 2:42:09.260]  So stay with us for that.
[2:42:09.260 --> 2:42:11.260]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[2:42:11.260 --> 2:42:18.260]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jesse in Missouri, the queen of
[2:42:18.260 --> 2:42:19.260]  conspiracy.
[2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:21.260]  Jesse, go ahead.
[2:42:21.260 --> 2:42:23.260]  Hey, how are you?
[2:42:23.260 --> 2:42:25.260]  Man, I'm just blessed to be talking to you, brother.
[2:42:25.260 --> 2:42:26.260]  Definitely.
[2:42:26.260 --> 2:42:28.260]  I got some points.
[2:42:28.260 --> 2:42:31.260]  So we could counter that disinformation campaign with
[2:42:31.260 --> 2:42:33.260]  more app.
[2:42:33.260 --> 2:42:35.260]  You know how you can pause a video when somebody's making a
[2:42:35.260 --> 2:42:36.260]  funny face?
[2:42:36.260 --> 2:42:37.260]  Yes.
[2:42:37.260 --> 2:42:40.260]  That's a lot like the way you explain what this is.
[2:42:40.260 --> 2:42:42.260]  I mean, they admit that's what happened.
[2:42:42.260 --> 2:42:44.260]  They put him in a room said, take your mic off.
[2:42:44.260 --> 2:42:46.260]  He leans back, take the mic out and they run in on him.
[2:42:46.260 --> 2:42:48.260]  It's just, it's, it's, it's criminal and trap.
[2:42:48.260 --> 2:42:50.260]  That's what it is.
[2:42:50.260 --> 2:42:51.260]  Right.
[2:42:51.260 --> 2:42:54.260]  But you, you know, you see somebody's funny face mid video
[2:42:54.260 --> 2:42:56.260]  or in the middle of a word, whatever.
[2:42:56.260 --> 2:42:59.260]  Notice the law says like convicted pedophiles have your
[2:42:59.260 --> 2:43:02.260]  sons and daughters ride on them at drag queen storytime,
[2:43:02.260 --> 2:43:05.260]  but if a woman jumps on Giuliani in a hotel room,
[2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:06.260]  he's bad.
[2:43:06.260 --> 2:43:09.260]  And we got to wear a mask and can't touch each other.
[2:43:09.260 --> 2:43:11.260]  You see how they're doing this?
[2:43:11.260 --> 2:43:12.260]  Absolutely.
[2:43:12.260 --> 2:43:16.260]  So you always ask where we're at, where people think we're at.
[2:43:16.260 --> 2:43:19.260]  Did you remember last, in the last year, beginning of this
[2:43:19.260 --> 2:43:23.260]  year, you mean job postings on the website people found for,
[2:43:23.260 --> 2:43:26.260]  I forget the exact term relocation and reintegration
[2:43:26.260 --> 2:43:29.260]  specialists or whatever.
[2:43:29.260 --> 2:43:30.260]  Yes.
[2:43:30.260 --> 2:43:33.260]  I remember I broke seven years ago, official department of the
[2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:35.260]  army and they said it was fake.
[2:43:35.260 --> 2:43:38.260]  The army confirmed it was real that Obama wanted people hired
[2:43:38.260 --> 2:43:41.260]  to relocate millions of Americans during a collapse,
[2:43:41.260 --> 2:43:44.260]  including our social security numbers and how to put us in
[2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:45.260]  camps.
[2:43:45.260 --> 2:43:46.260]  Yes.
[2:43:46.260 --> 2:43:47.260]  Yeah.
[2:43:47.260 --> 2:43:49.260]  These were job postings from January, December.
[2:43:49.260 --> 2:43:50.260]  I forget exactly.
[2:43:50.260 --> 2:43:52.260]  But anyway, Europe.
[2:43:52.260 --> 2:43:54.260]  Oh, they're doing them again.
[2:43:54.260 --> 2:43:55.260]  I didn't know that.
[2:43:55.260 --> 2:43:57.260]  That was eight years ago recently.
[2:43:57.260 --> 2:43:58.260]  Oh, wow.
[2:43:58.260 --> 2:43:59.260]  No, this was January.
[2:43:59.260 --> 2:44:01.260]  One more quick thing and I'll get off here.
[2:44:01.260 --> 2:44:03.260]  This is something for you to ponder.
[2:44:03.260 --> 2:44:06.260]  Have you researched anything about the grain solar minimum?
[2:44:06.260 --> 2:44:08.260]  We're entering potential new ice age.
[2:44:08.260 --> 2:44:09.260]  How does that line up?
[2:44:09.260 --> 2:44:10.260]  Absolutely.
[2:44:10.260 --> 2:44:12.260]  They know we're going into an ice age.
[2:44:12.260 --> 2:44:15.260]  And so why are they spraying aluminum oxide blocking solar
[2:44:15.260 --> 2:44:16.260]  radiation?
[2:44:16.260 --> 2:44:19.260]  They're trying to trigger it early.
[2:44:19.260 --> 2:44:20.260]  Right.
[2:44:20.260 --> 2:44:24.260]  So that aligning with the fourth turning in 2020 perfectly planned.
[2:44:24.260 --> 2:44:25.260]  Yeah.
[2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:26.260]  Exactly.
[2:44:26.260 --> 2:44:27.260]  They're trying to pull off a mass culling.
[2:44:27.260 --> 2:44:29.260]  They're trying to cut our food supply off before we go
[2:44:29.260 --> 2:44:30.260]  interstellar.
[2:44:30.260 --> 2:44:32.260]  Have a good day.
[2:44:32.260 --> 2:44:33.260]  Yeah.
[2:44:33.260 --> 2:44:34.260]  Absolutely.
[2:44:34.260 --> 2:44:35.260]  Genius caller.
[2:44:35.260 --> 2:44:36.260]  Love these callers.
[2:44:36.260 --> 2:44:37.260]  Incredible.
[2:44:37.260 --> 2:44:39.260]  Let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[2:44:39.260 --> 2:44:40.260]  He's been a long time caller.
[2:44:40.260 --> 2:44:41.260]  Really smart guy.
[2:44:41.260 --> 2:44:44.260]  Carlos, thanks for holding once you the order they were received.
[2:44:44.260 --> 2:44:45.260]  We really respect you.
[2:44:45.260 --> 2:44:46.260]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[2:44:46.260 --> 2:44:47.260]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:44:47.260 --> 2:44:50.260]  I just want to break some ground with you if possible.
[2:44:50.260 --> 2:44:55.260]  First of all, I think the CDC recently explained that masks,
[2:44:55.260 --> 2:44:59.260]  and they never said masks, were supposed to protect you from
[2:44:59.260 --> 2:45:01.260]  infection from any virus apparently.
[2:45:01.260 --> 2:45:02.260]  That's right.
[2:45:02.260 --> 2:45:04.260]  Valcy said it's a sign of respect, meaning you buy into the
[2:45:04.260 --> 2:45:05.260]  fraud.
[2:45:05.260 --> 2:45:07.260]  Well, there is a reason.
[2:45:07.260 --> 2:45:09.260]  You see, if I have a chance to explain to you why it doesn't
[2:45:09.260 --> 2:45:13.260]  work, why the masks don't work, besides openings, et cetera.
[2:45:13.260 --> 2:45:15.260]  But it's more important than that.
[2:45:15.260 --> 2:45:18.260]  But there's a segment which is not covered.
[2:45:18.260 --> 2:45:21.260]  Obviously, it's in the scientific community, and it's even in
[2:45:21.260 --> 2:45:25.260]  top secret research, that when you're trying to deal with
[2:45:25.260 --> 2:45:29.260]  artificial intelligence in the sense of robotics and robots and
[2:45:29.260 --> 2:45:34.260]  so on, human beings are very, very sensitive to very minute,
[2:45:34.260 --> 2:45:38.260]  you know, how you can detect the smallest amount of movement.
[2:45:38.260 --> 2:45:42.260]  They're very, because of our evolutionary ability.
[2:45:42.260 --> 2:45:47.260]  We subconsciously process a lot of minute movements of the lips
[2:45:47.260 --> 2:45:50.260]  when people are speaking and facial expressions, which cannot
[2:45:50.260 --> 2:45:54.260]  be, I don't care how much you practice or how much you try,
[2:45:54.260 --> 2:45:57.260]  get a robot to emulate the...
[2:45:57.260 --> 2:45:58.260]  That's right.
[2:45:58.260 --> 2:46:00.260]  Their best AI spoofing doesn't work.
[2:46:00.260 --> 2:46:01.260]  Human brain can track it.
[2:46:01.260 --> 2:46:02.260]  They can track it.
[2:46:02.260 --> 2:46:06.260]  Children in particular, when they're infants, they're the best
[2:46:06.260 --> 2:46:08.260]  of all, actually.
[2:46:08.260 --> 2:46:12.260]  But what I wanted to tell you is that by having people wearing
[2:46:12.260 --> 2:46:18.260]  masks, there's a conscious effort in the community that wants
[2:46:18.260 --> 2:46:22.260]  to sell you robots and wants to sell you...
[2:46:22.260 --> 2:46:23.260]  I agree.
[2:46:23.260 --> 2:46:26.260]  It's totally a dehumanization, not making us human.
[2:46:26.260 --> 2:46:28.260]  It's totally real.
[2:46:28.260 --> 2:46:32.260]  Yeah, by forcing people to wear masks all the time, we're getting
[2:46:32.260 --> 2:46:36.260]  used to seeing less features around the movement of the lips
[2:46:36.260 --> 2:46:40.260]  in the mouth and the chin, et cetera, that are telling you that
[2:46:40.260 --> 2:46:44.260]  the person's speaking and then you can lip read, essentially,
[2:46:44.260 --> 2:46:45.260]  whether you know it or not.
[2:46:45.260 --> 2:46:47.260]  Subconsciously, you can detect emotions.
[2:46:47.260 --> 2:46:51.260]  It's a giant occult ritual of dehumanization and submission
[2:46:51.260 --> 2:46:55.260]  and ahead of a robot takeover where we're not human anymore.
[2:46:55.260 --> 2:46:57.260]  So when robots hit the streets, we accept it.
[2:46:57.260 --> 2:47:00.260]  It's a massive de-evolutionary attack.
[2:47:00.260 --> 2:47:01.260]  Right.
[2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:05.260]  And you can't sell the technology because people will reject
[2:47:05.260 --> 2:47:07.260]  robots as humans, okay?
[2:47:07.260 --> 2:47:12.260]  And their effort is to make you be integrated to them so that
[2:47:12.260 --> 2:47:13.260]  they can replace you.
[2:47:13.260 --> 2:47:16.260]  Yes, and robots are allowed to deliver you things during
[2:47:16.260 --> 2:47:17.260]  lockdowns.
[2:47:17.260 --> 2:47:18.260]  They're safe.
[2:47:18.260 --> 2:47:19.260]  They're not dirty.
[2:47:19.260 --> 2:47:20.260]  You're bad.
[2:47:20.260 --> 2:47:21.260]  Correct.
[2:47:21.260 --> 2:47:23.260]  And the other part is why it doesn't work.
[2:47:23.260 --> 2:47:25.260]  If you give me a second, I'll explain.
[2:47:25.260 --> 2:47:26.260]  The smallest...
[2:47:26.260 --> 2:47:30.260]  But first of all, a virus is a part of micro messenger RNA.
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:33.260]  It's really not an organism.
[2:47:33.260 --> 2:47:36.260]  So there's no such thing as a vaccine for it.
[2:47:36.260 --> 2:47:37.260]  No, exactly.
[2:47:37.260 --> 2:47:40.260]  It's a sign of a sickness that's already there.
[2:47:40.260 --> 2:47:41.260]  Correct.
[2:47:41.260 --> 2:47:43.260]  What you're doing, Alex, is this.
[2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:46.260]  If you take a mask, if you and I went to the business to make
[2:47:46.260 --> 2:47:49.260]  the best masks in the world because there's money into that,
[2:47:49.260 --> 2:47:51.260]  we will have a limiting factor.
[2:47:51.260 --> 2:47:53.260]  And that is that people need to breathe.
[2:47:53.260 --> 2:47:57.260]  And if the openings in your masks are less than, let's say,
[2:47:57.260 --> 2:48:02.260]  0.3 microns, you cannot possibly breathe, okay?
[2:48:02.260 --> 2:48:04.260]  So you have to have openings.
[2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:07.260]  Not just on the inhale, but on the exhale.
[2:48:07.260 --> 2:48:12.260]  But a micron, a virus is 0.08.
[2:48:12.260 --> 2:48:13.260]  Sure, sure.
[2:48:13.260 --> 2:48:14.260]  They admit it's all a fraud.
[2:48:14.260 --> 2:48:15.260]  It's a suffocation.
[2:48:15.260 --> 2:48:16.260]  It's you're a prisoner.
[2:48:16.260 --> 2:48:18.260]  A gag is on your face.
[2:48:18.260 --> 2:48:19.260]  You're bound.
[2:48:19.260 --> 2:48:20.260]  You accept being a prisoner.
[2:48:20.260 --> 2:48:21.260]  Now you'll accept the vaccines.
[2:48:21.260 --> 2:48:23.260]  Now you accept the contact tracing.
[2:48:23.260 --> 2:48:24.260]  Now you'll accept the control.
[2:48:24.260 --> 2:48:26.260]  I'm going to come back to you and have you finish up.
[2:48:26.260 --> 2:48:28.260]  And then I'll go to Greg, Tom, Megan,
[2:48:28.260 --> 2:48:31.260]  Queen of Conspiracies up next after Carlos.
[2:48:31.260 --> 2:48:32.260]  Hour 4.
[2:48:32.260 --> 2:48:34.260]  It's 3-D.
[2:48:41.260 --> 2:48:43.260]  Band.Video
[2:48:45.260 --> 2:48:49.260]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:53.260]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[2:48:53.260 --> 2:48:56.260]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[2:48:56.260 --> 2:49:00.260]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home screen.
[2:49:00.260 --> 2:49:02.460]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[2:49:02.460 --> 2:49:04.620]  I suggest band.video.
[2:49:04.620 --> 2:49:08.020]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen,
[2:49:08.020 --> 2:49:10.100]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[2:49:10.100 --> 2:49:11.620]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[2:49:11.620 --> 2:49:12.980]  but by taking a little bit of action,
[2:49:12.980 --> 2:49:15.380]  you can override them, have the app,
[2:49:15.380 --> 2:49:18.500]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:49:18.500 --> 2:49:20.940]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[2:49:20.940 --> 2:49:22.700]  and click the share buttons below
[2:49:22.700 --> 2:49:25.220]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[2:49:25.220 --> 2:49:32.220]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[2:49:35.500 --> 2:49:38.420]  With two weeks left until the historic election,
[2:49:38.420 --> 2:49:40.500]  we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:43.140]  the top some already amazing sales.
[2:49:43.140 --> 2:49:46.420]  It's Black Friday comes in October special,
[2:49:46.420 --> 2:49:48.740]  something we did last year that was very, very popular.
[2:49:48.740 --> 2:49:50.740]  We did it for the whole month last year.
[2:49:50.740 --> 2:49:53.500]  We can only do it for 11 days until the end of the month
[2:49:53.500 --> 2:49:56.420]  because stocks are low in a lot of our best selling products.
[2:49:56.420 --> 2:49:59.540]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing
[2:49:59.540 --> 2:50:03.580]  at 50% off with free shipping is Ultra 12,
[2:50:03.580 --> 2:50:05.340]  incredible high quality B12,
[2:50:05.340 --> 2:50:07.620]  take it under the tongue, look into how great it is,
[2:50:07.620 --> 2:50:09.700]  your body's defenses, your health, your stamina,
[2:50:09.700 --> 2:50:12.420]  that's back in stock and vitamin mineral fusion
[2:50:12.420 --> 2:50:14.620]  with the zinc and the other vitamins and minerals
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:17.220]  that are essential and amino acids
[2:50:17.220 --> 2:50:19.660]  to make sure your body uploads it better.
[2:50:19.660 --> 2:50:23.460]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[2:50:23.460 --> 2:50:25.660]  Vitamin mineral fusion and Ultra 12,
[2:50:25.660 --> 2:50:28.060]  the flagship products of Black Friday
[2:50:28.060 --> 2:50:31.700]  comes in October sale at infowarstore.com
[2:50:31.700 --> 2:50:34.540]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:50:34.540 --> 2:50:50.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:50.620 --> 2:51:05.180]  I wonder, it's so wayless, I feel with sin, I wouldn't let my dear savior in.
[2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:09.820]  Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
[2:51:09.820 --> 2:51:13.860]  Praise the Lord, I saw the light.
[2:51:13.860 --> 2:51:15.620]  I saw the light.
[2:51:15.620 --> 2:51:18.020]  I saw the light.
[2:51:18.020 --> 2:51:20.300]  I saw the light.
[2:51:20.300 --> 2:51:24.940]  No more darkness, no more night.
[2:51:24.940 --> 2:51:26.900]  Now I'm so happy.
[2:51:26.900 --> 2:51:28.380]  The more stagnant your phone calls,
[2:51:28.380 --> 2:51:31.260]  but I want to play the Steve Wozniak clip from last year,
[2:51:31.260 --> 2:51:33.100]  co-founder of Apple saying,
[2:51:33.100 --> 2:51:37.380]  the best AI isn't one million of as good as an ant's brain.
[2:51:37.380 --> 2:51:41.740]  It's true, but the power we give AI,
[2:51:41.740 --> 2:51:44.100]  like a red light, it's just a switch
[2:51:44.100 --> 2:51:50.260]  that every few minutes changes from red to yellow to green.
[2:51:50.260 --> 2:51:52.540]  But you obey it.
[2:51:52.540 --> 2:51:54.660]  So its power is, it controls you.
[2:51:54.660 --> 2:51:57.060]  And a red light's good, we designed it, we built it,
[2:51:57.060 --> 2:51:58.980]  it helps us go and come, we did it.
[2:51:58.980 --> 2:52:01.340]  But what if they build red lights and green lights
[2:52:01.340 --> 2:52:04.340]  and yellow lights in the mind that make us slaves?
[2:52:04.340 --> 2:52:07.940]  And that's what AI is, it's not artificially intelligent.
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:09.300]  It is a fraud.
[2:52:09.300 --> 2:52:11.980]  And here is one of the top scientists in the world telling you that.
[2:52:11.980 --> 2:52:13.340]  Here it is.
[2:52:13.340 --> 2:52:14.820]  The application of computers today,
[2:52:14.820 --> 2:52:16.500]  it should not be called intelligence.
[2:52:16.500 --> 2:52:18.180]  It isn't going to get there.
[2:52:18.180 --> 2:52:19.620]  It isn't even close.
[2:52:19.620 --> 2:52:21.420]  We haven't even thought about making it as smart
[2:52:21.420 --> 2:52:23.580]  as the brain of an ant.
[2:52:23.580 --> 2:52:25.780]  We've never thought about building a computer that would say,
[2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:27.460]  what should I do today?
[2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:30.140]  You see, that's the difference with the intuition
[2:52:30.140 --> 2:52:34.380]  of a human brain that we really haven't gotten close to.
[2:52:34.380 --> 2:52:37.540]  My mother said that when I was about 16 years old,
[2:52:37.540 --> 2:52:39.540]  we're standing on a beach in Cancun looking out
[2:52:39.540 --> 2:52:41.620]  of the storm blow in with a rainbow.
[2:52:41.620 --> 2:52:43.500]  She looked at me and she said, son,
[2:52:43.500 --> 2:52:47.540]  there'll never be a computer that can recognize beauty.
[2:52:47.540 --> 2:52:51.100]  That's the soul of God we have.
[2:52:51.100 --> 2:52:55.820]  Our capacity to commune with God in God's creation.
[2:52:55.820 --> 2:52:57.540]  We don't worship the creation.
[2:52:57.540 --> 2:52:58.300]  We worship God.
[2:52:58.300 --> 2:53:00.940]  But our interfacing with creation is interfacing with God.
[2:53:00.940 --> 2:53:02.060]  Do you understand that?
[2:53:02.060 --> 2:53:03.580]  I said, yes, mother, I understand that.
[2:53:07.620 --> 2:53:09.860]  You recognize what's good and what's bad.
[2:53:09.860 --> 2:53:16.980]  That is sentient free will.
[2:53:16.980 --> 2:53:19.340]  And oh, this phone shows me a website.
[2:53:19.340 --> 2:53:21.140]  This phone shows me Joe Rogan.
[2:53:21.140 --> 2:53:22.740]  This phone shows me Melania Trump.
[2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:23.940]  It shows me Bill Clinton.
[2:53:23.940 --> 2:53:26.660]  It shows me whoever.
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:29.300]  Shows me the NFL and a guy running people over.
[2:53:29.300 --> 2:53:30.660]  That's not that phone.
[2:53:30.660 --> 2:53:31.860]  That's a person.
[2:53:31.860 --> 2:53:33.580]  That's a window into what they did.
[2:53:33.580 --> 2:53:35.900]  And we built that.
[2:53:35.900 --> 2:53:37.740]  But the left tells us we're obsolete.
[2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:38.300]  We're done.
[2:53:38.300 --> 2:53:38.900]  We're over.
[2:53:38.900 --> 2:53:41.060]  Bow down, die, go away.
[2:53:41.060 --> 2:53:43.660]  What a fraud.
[2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:47.540]  The celebration of humanity is what we need.
[2:53:47.540 --> 2:53:52.380]  Carlos, finishing up your point about the mask
[2:53:52.380 --> 2:53:55.020]  of the dehumanization and just how fundamental it
[2:53:55.020 --> 2:54:01.180]  is in our whole development to tell us our faces are dirty
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:03.020]  and we're dirty and we're bad.
[2:54:03.020 --> 2:54:07.660]  I mean, that is the most satanic thing I've ever seen.
[2:54:07.660 --> 2:54:10.860]  But what I wanted to tell you is that people will not accept
[2:54:10.860 --> 2:54:16.420]  robots if they're trying to make them be like us or replace us.
[2:54:16.420 --> 2:54:18.540]  They need to make us like robots.
[2:54:18.540 --> 2:54:19.540]  I get it.
[2:54:19.540 --> 2:54:23.100]  Yeah, they just want us not to be able to detect
[2:54:23.100 --> 2:54:26.420]  the subtle cues that we use in human communication.
[2:54:26.420 --> 2:54:28.620]  The voice, for instance, behind the mask
[2:54:28.620 --> 2:54:32.260]  is not the same as the normal voice.
[2:54:32.260 --> 2:54:35.180]  No, they don't want us to reject the driverless cars
[2:54:35.180 --> 2:54:37.180]  and the robot rollout that's happening now.
[2:54:37.180 --> 2:54:37.940]  And you're right.
[2:54:37.940 --> 2:54:40.660]  There's a lot of check boxes of why they do this.
[2:54:40.660 --> 2:54:42.980]  They make us obsolete, make us hate ourselves,
[2:54:42.980 --> 2:54:43.940]  make us feel dirty.
[2:54:43.940 --> 2:54:46.820]  But the biggest thing is accept the rollout of robots.
[2:54:46.820 --> 2:54:49.380]  And the first robot I see, the first driverless car
[2:54:49.380 --> 2:54:51.020]  I see is getting destroyed.
[2:54:51.020 --> 2:54:52.940]  The first robot I see is being destroyed.
[2:54:52.940 --> 2:54:55.220]  We must overthrow them now.
[2:54:55.220 --> 2:54:59.980]  Yes, I will tell you that if I ever have a car that I cannot
[2:54:59.980 --> 2:55:03.740]  drive because it doesn't allow me to drive and then
[2:55:03.740 --> 2:55:06.060]  a person crosses the street and a child
[2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:09.580]  runs behind that person and the car decides who to kill,
[2:55:09.580 --> 2:55:11.260]  I don't want to be in that car.
[2:55:11.260 --> 2:55:12.780]  Sorry, OK?
[2:55:12.780 --> 2:55:15.820]  And they admit AI is already deciding which
[2:55:15.820 --> 2:55:16.980]  group, oh, that's a bus.
[2:55:16.980 --> 2:55:19.500]  It's bigger, so I'll hit it instead of the kids.
[2:55:19.500 --> 2:55:20.700]  Yeah, it's all sick.
[2:55:20.700 --> 2:55:22.100]  It's sick.
[2:55:22.100 --> 2:55:25.180]  There are people out there today that
[2:55:25.180 --> 2:55:28.980]  are thinking artificial intelligence will replace us.
[2:55:28.980 --> 2:55:31.820]  And if they cannot replace us, then we integrate with it.
[2:55:31.820 --> 2:55:33.180]  I think this is insane.
[2:55:33.180 --> 2:55:34.860]  And it should be curtailed.
[2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:37.700]  That kind of talk that belongs among human beings.
[2:55:37.700 --> 2:55:39.660]  Carlis, let's declare war on them.
[2:55:39.660 --> 2:55:40.620]  I love you.
[2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:41.540]  War, war.
[2:55:43.860 --> 2:55:47.580]  A major life lesson just took place last night.
[2:55:47.580 --> 2:55:52.340]  The top story in the country was that Hunter Biden's laptop
[2:55:52.340 --> 2:55:53.900]  information had come out.
[2:55:53.900 --> 2:55:58.620]  Him with hookers and shooting porno movies and cracked pipes.
[2:55:58.620 --> 2:56:02.340]  But the real news was how he had indeed been bought off
[2:56:02.340 --> 2:56:05.700]  by Barisma and had done so at the behest of his father who
[2:56:05.700 --> 2:56:08.300]  was getting large parts of the money.
[2:56:08.300 --> 2:56:11.100]  But you see, Twitter and Facebook and others totally
[2:56:11.100 --> 2:56:14.500]  censored the info and even censored major news publications
[2:56:14.500 --> 2:56:15.900]  and even censored the president.
[2:56:15.900 --> 2:56:17.420]  But when the president and Congress
[2:56:17.420 --> 2:56:19.020]  said they were going to take action,
[2:56:19.020 --> 2:56:22.820]  suddenly Jack of Twitter said he didn't know what had happened
[2:56:22.820 --> 2:56:23.900]  and it was wrong.
[2:56:23.900 --> 2:56:25.580]  And that's the big life lesson here.
[2:56:25.580 --> 2:56:29.940]  Standing up and saying no to organized crime, rapid caring,
[2:56:29.940 --> 2:56:31.380]  is the way to stop it.
[2:56:31.380 --> 2:56:34.500]  Grobbling to it and letting big tech lie to us and run over us
[2:56:34.500 --> 2:56:36.660]  is the way to make these tyrants continue
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:38.180]  to go absolutely crazy.
[2:56:38.180 --> 2:56:41.220]  Remember, they support communist China and its death camps.
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:42.300]  What will they do to us?
[2:56:42.300 --> 2:56:43.140]  Will we now know?
[2:56:50.580 --> 2:56:56.060]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:56:56.060 --> 2:56:59.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:56:59.060 --> 2:57:01.340]  Well, Trump's going to debate two people tonight.
[2:57:01.340 --> 2:57:04.460]  I'll be here live covering it at infowars.com.
[2:57:04.460 --> 2:57:08.300]  Forge Slash Show and newswars.com with Deon Lorraine.
[2:57:08.300 --> 2:57:10.940]  Trump versus Biden with special assistance
[2:57:10.940 --> 2:57:13.420]  from Kristen Welker.
[2:57:13.420 --> 2:57:17.620]  Please join us and share that link from 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[2:57:17.620 --> 2:57:19.940]  That's the URL that's not being censored right now.
[2:57:19.940 --> 2:57:21.580]  We're in 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[2:57:21.580 --> 2:57:23.380]  I want to hit a few more of your calls ahead
[2:57:23.380 --> 2:57:26.300]  of a special guest who's about to take over on the fall of Biden
[2:57:26.300 --> 2:57:29.060]  and what he's predicting is coming next.
[2:57:29.060 --> 2:57:32.220]  That is, of course, with the man with the website,
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:33.700]  Bishop Gators.
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:37.380]  Bishop Larry Gators will be joining us coming up.
[2:57:37.380 --> 2:57:41.260]  But let's get to these clips, because Trump finally
[2:57:41.260 --> 2:57:43.860]  had them record Leslie Stahl in 60 minutes.
[2:57:43.860 --> 2:57:45.060]  But the audio is not the best.
[2:57:45.060 --> 2:57:45.540]  It's OK.
[2:57:45.540 --> 2:57:46.540]  It doesn't matter.
[2:57:46.540 --> 2:57:48.740]  Pretty amazing clips.
[2:57:48.740 --> 2:57:52.740]  Trump on suburban women, myth 145 will play that.
[2:57:52.740 --> 2:57:55.740]  Talks about why he thinks polls on suburban women are wrong.
[2:57:55.740 --> 2:58:00.420]  Trump says that he hopes you're right,
[2:58:00.420 --> 2:58:02.580]  talking about the fact that she totally
[2:58:02.580 --> 2:58:06.460]  fears that his supporters will actually back him.
[2:58:06.460 --> 2:58:07.940]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:10.220]  Whatever they tell you is bad and dirty
[2:58:10.220 --> 2:58:11.580]  is what they know is victory.
[2:58:11.580 --> 2:58:13.500]  So let's go ahead and play these clips back to back,
[2:58:13.500 --> 2:58:15.540]  all three clips.
[2:58:15.540 --> 2:58:19.340]  OK, let me ask you something about suburban women.
[2:58:19.340 --> 2:58:19.940]  Yeah?
[2:58:19.940 --> 2:58:22.740]  You said the other day to suburban women.
[2:58:22.740 --> 2:58:24.580]  Can you please lie to me, please?
[2:58:24.580 --> 2:58:25.420]  Oh, I didn't say that.
[2:58:25.420 --> 2:58:28.460]  You know, that's so misleading the way I say jokingly.
[2:58:28.460 --> 2:58:30.500]  Suburban women, you should love me,
[2:58:30.500 --> 2:58:32.340]  because I'm giving you security.
[2:58:32.340 --> 2:58:34.420]  And I got rid of the worst regulation.
[2:58:34.420 --> 2:58:38.660]  See, the way you said that is why people think of you
[2:58:38.660 --> 2:58:41.140]  and everyone else's fake news.
[2:58:41.140 --> 2:58:43.780]  I said, kiddingly, suburban women,
[2:58:43.780 --> 2:58:45.100]  women, you should love me.
[2:58:45.100 --> 2:58:49.060]  I got rid of a regulation that would bring low income housing
[2:58:49.060 --> 2:58:53.620]  into suburbia that would destroy suburbia.
[2:58:53.620 --> 2:58:55.500]  And I said that in a joking way.
[2:58:55.500 --> 2:58:58.460]  The way you have it is like, oh, like I'm begging.
[2:58:58.460 --> 2:58:59.900]  I'm kidding.
[2:58:59.900 --> 2:59:00.580]  Play it.
[2:59:00.580 --> 2:59:01.500]  And I'm kidding.
[2:59:01.500 --> 2:59:04.060]  That is such a misleading question, Leslie.
[2:59:04.060 --> 2:59:07.220]  But you're behind the suburban women in the polls.
[2:59:07.220 --> 2:59:08.380]  I doubt it.
[2:59:08.380 --> 2:59:09.140]  I doubt it.
[2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:10.860]  I really doubt it.
[2:59:10.860 --> 2:59:13.860]  I'm saving suburbia.
[2:59:13.860 --> 2:59:16.180]  He's going to destroy suburbia.
[2:59:16.180 --> 2:59:18.460]  He's got a regulation, which I terminated,
[2:59:18.460 --> 2:59:20.220]  that he would put back.
[2:59:20.220 --> 2:59:23.780]  And even worse, that will destroy,
[2:59:23.780 --> 2:59:28.300]  that will bring low income housing projects into suburbia.
[2:59:28.300 --> 2:59:29.700]  And women don't understand that.
[2:59:29.700 --> 2:59:31.540]  And they've really learned about it over the last two,
[2:59:31.540 --> 2:59:32.380]  three weeks.
[2:59:32.380 --> 2:59:35.980]  I terminated the worst regulation you could possibly have.
[2:59:35.980 --> 2:59:37.300]  It's gone.
[2:59:37.300 --> 2:59:39.780]  And suburban women appreciate it.
[2:59:39.780 --> 2:59:41.740]  They want security and safety.
[2:59:41.740 --> 2:59:44.180]  Under Obama and Biden's operatives,
[2:59:44.180 --> 2:59:46.380]  so Obama put this into law, Trump killed it,
[2:59:46.380 --> 2:59:49.740]  you pay in your little town to build a 10 story building,
[2:59:49.740 --> 2:59:51.300]  the model, it's a U.N. model.
[2:59:51.300 --> 2:59:53.300]  And then you bring in homeless people,
[2:59:53.300 --> 2:59:56.100]  and then you take care of them and pay for them.
[2:59:56.100 --> 2:59:58.700]  You can't make this up.
[2:59:58.700 --> 3:00:00.620]  Continue.
[3:00:00.620 --> 3:00:03.460]  I've been endorsed by almost every police department,
[3:00:03.460 --> 3:00:06.180]  almost every law enforcement group in the country.
[3:00:06.180 --> 3:00:08.740]  He's been endorsed by almost nobody.
[3:00:08.740 --> 3:00:11.460]  Suburban women want security.
[3:00:11.460 --> 3:00:13.820]  But the polls show that you're behind them.
[3:00:13.820 --> 3:00:14.420]  Oh, that's right.
[3:00:14.420 --> 3:00:15.060]  Perfect polls.
[3:00:15.060 --> 3:00:15.900]  Let me see some of these.
[3:00:15.900 --> 3:00:16.860]  Let me see some polls.
[3:00:16.860 --> 3:00:22.660]  The polls said Hillary was going to win 97% chance.
[3:00:22.660 --> 3:00:24.740]  But you hear that, oh, he's a loser.
[3:00:24.740 --> 3:00:25.540]  I'll vote against him.
[3:00:25.540 --> 3:00:26.580]  I want to be a winner.
[3:00:26.580 --> 3:00:28.420]  It's a giant manipulation.
[3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:29.940]  It's not going to work this time either.
[3:00:29.940 --> 3:00:31.780]  But they're still going to hold up the election
[3:00:31.780 --> 3:00:34.540]  and still say he lost, and still cause a civil war,
[3:00:34.540 --> 3:00:35.740]  because they work for chai comms.
[3:00:35.740 --> 3:00:36.500]  And they don't care.
[3:00:36.500 --> 3:00:37.580]  They never got in trouble.
[3:00:37.580 --> 3:00:39.500]  Continue.
[3:00:39.500 --> 3:00:42.460]  I'm watching all these people janded together,
[3:00:42.460 --> 3:00:45.700]  and I'm seeing most of them without masks.
[3:00:45.700 --> 3:00:47.940]  And I'm wondering the message that you're
[3:00:47.940 --> 3:00:50.100]  sending with these pictures coming up.
[3:00:50.100 --> 3:00:50.700]  Take a look.
[3:00:50.700 --> 3:00:55.180]  Yesterday, we were in Arizona, record-setting rallies.
[3:00:55.180 --> 3:00:58.100]  Numbers of people like nobody's seen before.
[3:00:58.100 --> 3:01:01.100]  Many, many masks I watch.
[3:01:01.100 --> 3:01:02.860]  Who used to have bigger rallies?
[3:01:02.860 --> 3:01:04.380]  No, these are much bigger than I ever had.
[3:01:04.380 --> 3:01:05.500]  I don't want to figure out.
[3:01:05.500 --> 3:01:07.180]  I have nobody to worry about.
[3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:08.100]  It's just so negative.
[3:01:08.100 --> 3:01:09.940]  These are the biggest rallies we've ever had.
[3:01:09.940 --> 3:01:11.260]  That's what Trump entered into the interview.
[3:01:11.260 --> 3:01:12.580]  He was thinking about it.
[3:01:12.580 --> 3:01:14.860]  These are the biggest rallies we've ever had.
[3:01:14.860 --> 3:01:17.260]  We are having numbers like we've never had.
[3:01:17.260 --> 3:01:17.820]  Tell me about the mask.
[3:01:17.820 --> 3:01:21.100]  There is more, excuse me, no, you made a statement.
[3:01:21.100 --> 3:01:23.740]  There's more enthusiasm right now for us
[3:01:23.740 --> 3:01:26.340]  than we ever had before, ever.
[3:01:26.340 --> 3:01:29.980]  And you'll see that in a short period of time.
[3:01:29.980 --> 3:01:31.300]  Well, what about the masks?
[3:01:31.300 --> 3:01:32.780]  A lot of people are wearing masks.
[3:01:32.780 --> 3:01:34.860]  I mean, I looked yesterday.
[3:01:34.860 --> 3:01:37.020]  A lot of people make masks, and it's outdoor.
[3:01:37.020 --> 3:01:38.380]  They want it outdoor.
[3:01:38.380 --> 3:01:41.540]  When your birthday, you can't have a meeting.
[3:01:41.540 --> 3:01:42.940]  You're not allowed to.
[3:01:42.940 --> 3:01:46.780]  You have to be announcement, and all the people get excited.
[3:01:46.780 --> 3:01:47.500]  She's done.
[3:01:47.500 --> 3:01:49.260]  CBS is done.
[3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:49.900]  They're all done.
[3:01:49.900 --> 3:01:52.100]  They're encouraging about wearing masks.
[3:01:52.100 --> 3:01:53.420]  I tell people they wear masks.
[3:01:53.420 --> 3:01:54.660]  Listen, pause.
[3:01:54.660 --> 3:01:58.260]  We just woke up and started kicking their ass the last few years.
[3:01:58.260 --> 3:02:00.100]  And then we think like they're striking back.
[3:02:00.100 --> 3:02:02.580]  Even if they kill Trump, kill me, take us off the air.
[3:02:02.580 --> 3:02:03.780]  You're done.
[3:02:03.780 --> 3:02:04.940]  We're awake now.
[3:02:04.940 --> 3:02:05.900]  It's over.
[3:02:05.900 --> 3:02:08.020]  It's like we punch you back.
[3:02:08.020 --> 3:02:09.620]  You hit us, we fall down.
[3:02:09.620 --> 3:02:10.980]  There's 1,000 of us behind us.
[3:02:10.980 --> 3:02:12.460]  We're done, globalists.
[3:02:12.460 --> 3:02:16.460]  Schumer, the New World Order, Hillary, Michael Moore.
[3:02:16.460 --> 3:02:19.220]  You're done, you big fat degenerates.
[3:02:19.220 --> 3:02:21.260]  You frickin' pedophile maggots.
[3:02:21.260 --> 3:02:23.420]  And you know what you smell it to.
[3:02:23.420 --> 3:02:25.100]  You losers.
[3:02:25.100 --> 3:02:26.580]  You pieces of trash.
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:31.380]  Go back to them.
[3:02:31.380 --> 3:02:33.980]  See, we hand out thousands of masks.
[3:02:33.980 --> 3:02:35.940]  Look out, they're not wearing you.
[3:02:35.940 --> 3:02:37.460]  And you don't say they're wearing you.
[3:02:37.460 --> 3:02:38.740]  You've been looking yesterday.
[3:02:38.740 --> 3:02:39.740]  Take a look at that.
[3:02:39.740 --> 3:02:40.740]  Take a look yesterday.
[3:02:40.740 --> 3:02:43.060]  Everybody behind me.
[3:02:43.060 --> 3:02:44.900]  And I'm looking at other places.
[3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:45.900]  I'm looking at what's happening.
[3:02:45.900 --> 3:02:46.700]  You're bad.
[3:02:46.700 --> 3:02:47.820]  COVID's your fault.
[3:02:47.820 --> 3:02:48.660]  Right, right.
[3:02:48.660 --> 3:02:50.340]  A lot of people have masks.
[3:02:50.340 --> 3:02:51.740]  And it was outside.
[3:02:51.740 --> 3:02:54.740]  And you don't get up there and say, look.
[3:02:54.740 --> 3:02:57.020]  You don't get up there and say, we have an incivilization
[3:02:57.020 --> 3:02:59.060]  and starve 100 million people to death.
[3:02:59.060 --> 3:03:00.420]  You don't buy into the fraud.
[3:03:00.420 --> 3:03:01.940]  What are you doing?
[3:03:01.940 --> 3:03:03.180]  I'm with CBS.
[3:03:03.180 --> 3:03:04.820]  I'm Leslie Stahl.
[3:03:04.820 --> 3:03:08.220]  There has never been anything like what you're witnessing now.
[3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:09.340]  And you'll see that soon.
[3:03:09.340 --> 3:03:11.860]  OK, but I'm asking you about masks.
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:14.260]  I'm asking you about masks.
[3:03:14.260 --> 3:03:15.420]  I'm asking why you don't wear them.
[3:03:15.420 --> 3:03:17.180]  You commented on the size of the mask.
[3:03:17.180 --> 3:03:19.100]  You said they're not as big as they used to be.
[3:03:19.100 --> 3:03:20.660]  And I'm telling you, they're much bigger.
[3:03:20.660 --> 3:03:23.380]  OK, but I'm asking you now about the masks.
[3:03:23.380 --> 3:03:25.700]  She wanted to shut up.
[3:03:25.700 --> 3:03:27.380]  She's not a reporter.
[3:03:27.380 --> 3:03:28.580]  She's a globalist.
[3:03:28.580 --> 3:03:33.820]  Leslie, we hand out masks to everybody that comes to the run.
[3:03:33.820 --> 3:03:36.380]  We tell them to wear the masks.
[3:03:36.380 --> 3:03:37.820]  But get that lawyer idea.
[3:03:37.820 --> 3:03:40.460]  And pause it. Get rid of all diving boards.
[3:03:40.460 --> 3:03:43.300]  Someone statistically, if you've got a diving board
[3:03:43.300 --> 3:03:45.260]  to pull for 10 years, statistically,
[3:03:45.260 --> 3:03:46.460]  somebody will break their leg.
[3:03:46.460 --> 3:03:48.420]  Just get rid of it.
[3:03:48.420 --> 3:03:50.420]  Oh, if your pool's more than three feet deep,
[3:03:50.420 --> 3:03:51.420]  someone might drown.
[3:03:51.420 --> 3:03:52.100]  Get rid of it.
[3:03:52.100 --> 3:03:53.620]  It's all lawyers.
[3:03:53.620 --> 3:03:56.340]  Oh, they're talking about in Austin getting
[3:03:56.340 --> 3:03:58.700]  rid of the green belt and just closing it
[3:03:58.700 --> 3:04:00.700]  because someone might hurt their leg.
[3:04:00.700 --> 3:04:02.380]  Oh, you can't have someone hiked down there.
[3:04:02.380 --> 3:04:03.260]  They might get hurt.
[3:04:03.260 --> 3:04:05.940]  This is a prison they're building.
[3:04:05.940 --> 3:04:07.500]  This is the nanny state.
[3:04:07.500 --> 3:04:10.460]  And she's like, you can't have Raleigh's mask.
[3:04:10.460 --> 3:04:13.340]  But the Muslims can stab and murder and kill
[3:04:13.340 --> 3:04:14.900]  and burn down cities.
[3:04:14.900 --> 3:04:17.820]  And, you know, all that's cutesy cake time.
[3:04:17.820 --> 3:04:20.220]  It's a joke, and no one buys it.
[3:04:20.220 --> 3:04:22.140]  No wonder he entered into the interview.
[3:04:22.140 --> 3:04:24.620]  She sounds like a whimpering chihuahua
[3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:26.460]  that has electrodes connected to it.
[3:04:26.460 --> 3:04:30.340]  Just, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
[3:04:30.340 --> 3:04:31.980]  Because she can't let him talk.
[3:04:31.980 --> 3:04:34.100]  Continue.
[3:04:34.100 --> 3:04:35.300]  No problem.
[3:04:35.300 --> 3:04:36.140]  They love you.
[3:04:36.140 --> 3:04:41.020]  They would pay attention to anything you said.
[3:04:41.020 --> 3:04:42.820]  I hope you're right.
[3:04:42.820 --> 3:04:43.580]  Go ahead.
[3:04:43.580 --> 3:04:45.020]  OK.
[3:04:45.020 --> 3:04:48.460]  This is important.
[3:04:48.460 --> 3:04:51.260]  Are you going to say that you didn't say this?
[3:04:51.260 --> 3:04:52.260]  Because I saw you say this.
[3:04:52.260 --> 3:04:53.260]  Go ahead.
[3:04:53.260 --> 3:04:54.260]  You're only trying to.
[3:04:54.260 --> 3:04:57.260]  I wish you would interview Joe Biden like you interviewed me.
[3:04:57.260 --> 3:04:58.060]  Hey, pause.
[3:04:58.060 --> 3:05:00.860]  She's like, I know you said this, so don't try to dodge it.
[3:05:00.860 --> 3:05:04.700]  I mean, these people are owned by Chinese communist banks
[3:05:04.700 --> 3:05:06.740]  that run giant death camps.
[3:05:06.740 --> 3:05:08.060]  So when you look at Leslie Stahl, remember,
[3:05:08.060 --> 3:05:10.460]  there's just people in death camps.
[3:05:10.460 --> 3:05:12.780]  But she's up there, oh, I'm a liberal woman.
[3:05:12.780 --> 3:05:15.380]  Oh, I'm so good.
[3:05:15.380 --> 3:05:17.940]  All right, look, I'm out of time.
[3:05:17.940 --> 3:05:19.940]  I did a good job today, I think, overall.
[3:05:19.940 --> 3:05:22.380]  We had one caller left yesterday, and I said,
[3:05:22.380 --> 3:05:23.660]  get their numbers.
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:25.780]  I'm going to call them tomorrow in front of the line.
[3:05:25.780 --> 3:05:27.780]  Queen of conspiracy.
[3:05:27.780 --> 3:05:31.380]  If you'll be there, we love you.
[3:05:31.380 --> 3:05:35.300]  Megan, Tom, Greg, we will get to all of you.
[3:05:35.300 --> 3:05:37.420]  Queen of conspiracy, 1130 tomorrow,
[3:05:37.420 --> 3:05:39.700]  I will open up the show with calls.
[3:05:39.700 --> 3:05:41.940]  Dun dun dun, Queen of conspiracy.
[3:05:41.940 --> 3:05:44.020]  Get their numbers, I'm going to call.
[3:05:44.020 --> 3:05:47.460]  I'm going to have them on first thing tomorrow.
[3:05:47.460 --> 3:05:51.540]  Tonight, coverage starts 5 p.m. with Owen Schreuer
[3:05:51.540 --> 3:05:52.580]  of the debate.
[3:05:52.580 --> 3:05:55.300]  I will be here with John Lorraine
[3:05:55.300 --> 3:05:57.260]  when she's covering the main debate.
[3:05:57.260 --> 3:05:58.220]  That restarts at five.
[3:05:58.220 --> 3:06:00.180]  What time is the actual debate, guys?
[3:06:00.180 --> 3:06:02.740]  You guys tell me, was it seven, eight central?
[3:06:02.740 --> 3:06:03.900]  Let me know about that.
[3:06:03.900 --> 3:06:05.700]  But I'll be here before the debate.
[3:06:05.700 --> 3:06:07.140]  I'll be here during the debate.
[3:06:07.140 --> 3:06:09.900]  I'll be here after the debate to take your phone calls yet
[3:06:09.900 --> 3:06:10.580]  again.
[3:06:10.580 --> 3:06:12.300]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:06:12.300 --> 3:06:14.260]  I want to just encourage you.
[3:06:14.260 --> 3:06:16.580]  Vitamins and minerals are great to protect yourself
[3:06:16.580 --> 3:06:19.660]  as a weapon against all the stuff that's going on.
[3:06:19.660 --> 3:06:23.340]  But what about t-shirts that spread the word in free speech?
[3:06:23.340 --> 3:06:24.300]  A lot of great t-shirts.
[3:06:24.300 --> 3:06:25.580]  The sale's about to end.
[3:06:25.580 --> 3:06:29.620]  1776 in free shipping on all t-shirts at infowarstore.com.
[3:06:29.620 --> 3:06:33.780]  Triple-page repoints and free shipping, infowarstore.com.
[3:06:33.780 --> 3:06:37.780]  And get your Ultra 12 to boost your body's immune system
[3:06:37.780 --> 3:06:38.700]  before it sells out.
[3:06:38.700 --> 3:06:40.060]  It's selling out very quick.
[3:06:40.060 --> 3:07:10.020]  Stay with us.
[3:07:11.020 --> 3:07:15.500]  The system is censoring because the power of the people
[3:07:15.500 --> 3:07:17.180]  overrode them four years ago.
[3:07:17.180 --> 3:07:18.820]  Trump has finally figured this out.
[3:07:18.820 --> 3:07:21.420]  And since he's going to take action once re-elected,
[3:07:21.420 --> 3:07:22.140]  he gets big tech.
[3:07:22.140 --> 3:07:23.540]  I mean, he's a modern situation.
[3:07:23.540 --> 3:07:25.340]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now.
[3:07:25.340 --> 3:07:27.980]  So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[3:07:27.980 --> 3:07:30.140]  We the people are taking action now.
[3:07:30.140 --> 3:07:31.420]  And you can do it very, very easily
[3:07:31.420 --> 3:07:34.700]  by sharing 2020ElectionsCenter.com, 2020ElectionsCenter.com,
[3:07:34.700 --> 3:07:37.860]  and checking out the new redesigned infowars.com
[3:07:37.860 --> 3:07:38.820]  and sharing that link.
[3:07:38.820 --> 3:07:41.660]  Oh, that's really acceptable, yeah.
[3:07:41.660 --> 3:07:45.460]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[3:07:45.460 --> 3:07:48.140]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts
[3:07:48.140 --> 3:07:49.780]  you refuse to accept.
[3:07:49.780 --> 3:07:51.780]  If you have a family member suffering
[3:07:51.780 --> 3:07:54.180]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[3:07:54.180 --> 3:07:58.620]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[3:07:58.620 --> 3:08:01.660]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[3:08:01.660 --> 3:08:04.860]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[3:08:04.860 --> 3:08:08.340]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate
[3:08:08.340 --> 3:08:10.940]  of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[3:08:10.940 --> 3:08:15.260]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[3:08:15.260 --> 3:08:20.220]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[3:08:20.220 --> 3:08:24.460]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[3:08:24.460 --> 3:08:26.780]  and activity of immune cells.
[3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:28.420]  It worked for my family.
[3:08:28.420 --> 3:08:31.740]  And now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:35.300]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[3:08:35.300 --> 3:08:38.340]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member,
[3:08:38.340 --> 3:08:40.900]  or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[3:08:45.340 --> 3:08:48.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:48.180 --> 3:09:10.660]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show with your guest
[3:09:10.660 --> 3:09:13.660]  host and moderator today, Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:09:13.660 --> 3:09:17.700]  We are so very honored to be on America's
[3:09:17.700 --> 3:09:22.660]  number one television and radio show right now
[3:09:22.660 --> 3:09:23.900]  in the 21st century.
[3:09:23.900 --> 3:09:25.900]  And that is the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:28.140]  I'm so very honored to be back with you guys.
[3:09:28.140 --> 3:09:29.660]  My name is Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:09:29.660 --> 3:09:34.300]  I am the host and the moderator of the nationally
[3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:37.740]  and internationally syndicated radio show Global Spiritual
[3:09:37.740 --> 3:09:41.420]  Revolution Radio through the WOR 17 AM Network,
[3:09:41.420 --> 3:09:43.300]  The Voice of New York.
[3:09:43.300 --> 3:09:46.300]  We can be heard around the world in approximately 200
[3:09:46.300 --> 3:09:50.420]  countries, speaking to around between 150 million
[3:09:50.420 --> 3:09:53.180]  to 200 million people around the world
[3:09:53.180 --> 3:09:57.020]  through the iHeart radio network and the iHeart media group.
[3:09:57.020 --> 3:10:01.740]  Now, I'm so very excited to be unpacking
[3:10:01.740 --> 3:10:07.860]  this powerful topic today concerning the House of Cards,
[3:10:07.860 --> 3:10:11.340]  the coming fall of the Biden crime family.
[3:10:11.340 --> 3:10:14.980]  Again, the House of Cards concerning the coming fall
[3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:16.660]  of the Biden crime family.
[3:10:16.660 --> 3:10:21.620]  Now, up until this week, I thought Hillary Clinton,
[3:10:21.620 --> 3:10:26.220]  Bill Clinton, was the most corrupt family
[3:10:26.220 --> 3:10:29.260]  duo in American history, but they are not.
[3:10:29.260 --> 3:10:31.220]  It is the Biden family.
[3:10:31.220 --> 3:10:37.020]  Now, it speaks of a 16th century mathematician
[3:10:37.020 --> 3:10:41.060]  by the name of Dr. Johannes Kepler, who once said,
[3:10:41.060 --> 3:10:45.900]  concerning the Kepler conjecture philosophy,
[3:10:45.900 --> 3:10:49.460]  that there is a global pattern of history
[3:10:49.460 --> 3:10:54.860]  that has been dis-patterned by a global pattern of corruption.
[3:10:54.860 --> 3:10:58.660]  Again, there is a global pattern of history
[3:10:58.660 --> 3:11:02.260]  that has been dis-patterned or dysfunction
[3:11:02.260 --> 3:11:07.380]  that we call the global dysfunctionality of a light
[3:11:07.380 --> 3:11:10.380]  pattern because of corruption.
[3:11:10.380 --> 3:11:12.660]  We call this chaos theory.
[3:11:12.660 --> 3:11:15.700]  And so we're going to examine the bloodline
[3:11:15.700 --> 3:11:22.340]  of the Joe Biden family, which goes back as early as the 1600s,
[3:11:22.340 --> 3:11:26.060]  that the Biden bloodline in connection to the Robinette
[3:11:26.060 --> 3:11:31.260]  bloodline were full of racist slave owners.
[3:11:31.260 --> 3:11:33.380]  This is going to blow your mind today
[3:11:33.380 --> 3:11:36.980]  concerning the House of Cards, the coming fall
[3:11:36.980 --> 3:11:39.820]  of the Biden crime family.
[3:11:39.820 --> 3:11:47.340]  Now, Joseph Robinette Biden was born in 1942.
[3:11:47.340 --> 3:11:51.260]  His generations, going back to seven and eight generations,
[3:11:51.260 --> 3:11:55.700]  were brutal slave owners out of the United Kingdom, out
[3:11:55.700 --> 3:11:59.380]  of England and out of Scotland, who later immigrated
[3:11:59.380 --> 3:12:03.460]  to the United States during the early parts of the 1800s
[3:12:03.460 --> 3:12:07.580]  to the states of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland.
[3:12:07.580 --> 3:12:12.420]  Now, Senator Biden, well, Vice President Biden,
[3:12:12.420 --> 3:12:18.900]  is very close to a man by the name of Robert Allen Stanford.
[3:12:18.900 --> 3:12:21.460]  Now, Robert Allen Stanford was the creator
[3:12:21.460 --> 3:12:25.740]  of the Stanford Capital Management firm.
[3:12:25.740 --> 3:12:28.180]  This Robert Allen Stanford is now
[3:12:28.180 --> 3:12:35.100]  serving a 110-year sentence, which he was convicted going back
[3:12:35.100 --> 3:12:39.340]  to eight years ago, to the year 2012,
[3:12:39.340 --> 3:12:44.100]  because of a massive global Ponzi scheme,
[3:12:44.100 --> 3:12:49.340]  where he had defrauded between 7 to 8 billion people, not just
[3:12:49.340 --> 3:12:52.940]  here in the United States, but around the world.
[3:12:52.940 --> 3:12:56.860]  Now, Joe Biden, including Hunter Biden
[3:12:56.860 --> 3:13:03.340]  and the late Bob Biden, who had died in 2015 of a brain tumor,
[3:13:03.340 --> 3:13:10.820]  sat on the board of the Stanford Private Equity Fund.
[3:13:10.820 --> 3:13:15.260]  Now, there was a famous Hollywood athlete
[3:13:15.260 --> 3:13:18.860]  who recently died early this year on the 26th of January
[3:13:18.860 --> 3:13:20.580]  in 2020.
[3:13:20.580 --> 3:13:24.060]  A young man by the name of Kobe B. Bryant
[3:13:24.060 --> 3:13:27.460]  was defrauded out of $1.7 million
[3:13:27.460 --> 3:13:31.780]  by the Robert Allen Stanford Equity Fund.
[3:13:31.780 --> 3:13:37.540]  But the Biden sat on that board up until a year ago.
[3:13:37.540 --> 3:13:41.100]  And now, this individual, Robert Allen Stanford,
[3:13:41.100 --> 3:13:46.220]  is serving a massive 110-year prison sentence
[3:13:46.220 --> 3:13:52.020]  because of a massive Ponzi scheme in which Bob Biden, the late
[3:13:52.020 --> 3:13:59.540]  Bob Biden, was serving as senior counsel up until the year
[3:13:59.540 --> 3:14:02.300]  of 2015, right before his death.
[3:14:02.300 --> 3:14:04.940]  But at the same time, Bob Biden, who
[3:14:04.940 --> 3:14:12.380]  was serving as the lead counsel for the Stanford Equity Fund,
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:16.980]  was also the attorney general for the state of Delaware.
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:19.860]  This is a major conflict of interest.
[3:14:19.860 --> 3:14:24.500]  So then, to understand the corrupt bloodline,
[3:14:24.500 --> 3:14:28.580]  natural and political, of the Joe Biden family,
[3:14:28.580 --> 3:14:32.300]  we have to look at this from a spiritual paradigm
[3:14:32.300 --> 3:14:34.820]  and then a political paradigm.
[3:14:34.820 --> 3:14:38.700]  And so Robert A. Stanford, who was also
[3:14:38.700 --> 3:14:40.860]  a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[3:14:40.860 --> 3:14:44.180]  the Tri-Liter Commission, the Club of Rome,
[3:14:44.180 --> 3:14:46.980]  the Committee of 300, the Hidden Hand,
[3:14:46.980 --> 3:14:52.500]  was a close co-fundant of one Joe Biden, including
[3:14:52.500 --> 3:14:56.140]  James Biden, the younger brother of Joe's sleepy,
[3:14:56.140 --> 3:14:59.580]  creeping sniffing Biden, who cannot remember his left foot
[3:14:59.580 --> 3:15:02.700]  from his right toe, another topic for another day.
[3:15:02.700 --> 3:15:07.380]  So then, Joe Biden, James Biden, the late Bob Biden,
[3:15:07.380 --> 3:15:13.620]  and the crackhead Hunter Biden sat on the executive board
[3:15:13.620 --> 3:15:18.900]  of this Stanford Private Equity Fund,
[3:15:18.900 --> 3:15:25.780]  going up until the year 2014, even though two years prior,
[3:15:25.780 --> 3:15:29.300]  Robert A. Stanford went to prison.
[3:15:29.300 --> 3:15:33.740]  And so then, the entire Biden bloodline
[3:15:33.740 --> 3:15:37.420]  is connected to national and international
[3:15:37.420 --> 3:15:41.380]  global political corruption, as we're just kind of
[3:15:41.380 --> 3:15:46.060]  laying this foundation concerning the crime family
[3:15:46.060 --> 3:15:49.500]  of one Joseph Robinette Biden.
[3:15:49.500 --> 3:15:54.700]  Now, it's interesting that Joe Biden is not only connected
[3:15:54.700 --> 3:15:58.900]  to Robin Island on Stanford, but Joe Biden
[3:15:58.900 --> 3:16:04.300]  is connected to a equity fund by the name of the Paradigm
[3:16:04.300 --> 3:16:06.780]  Global Advisory Group.
[3:16:06.780 --> 3:16:14.020]  Now, in 1989, a South Korean man by the name of James Park,
[3:16:14.020 --> 3:16:18.660]  the son-of-law of the billionaire Sun Young Moon
[3:16:18.660 --> 3:16:23.740]  of the unification movement that was created going back
[3:16:23.740 --> 3:16:25.020]  in 1954.
[3:16:25.020 --> 3:16:28.260]  Now, as a sign note, James Park, who
[3:16:28.260 --> 3:16:33.740]  had designed and created the Paradigm Global Advisory
[3:16:33.740 --> 3:16:38.620]  Group, which later was bought out by Joe Biden in the Biden
[3:16:38.620 --> 3:16:40.820]  family in 2006.
[3:16:40.820 --> 3:16:47.260]  So James Park, Sun Young Moon, was closely related financially
[3:16:47.260 --> 3:16:50.900]  and tied to Chinese intelligence, the Ministry of State
[3:16:50.900 --> 3:16:55.060]  Security, which is the Chinese equivalent of the American CI,
[3:16:55.060 --> 3:16:57.620]  including South Korean intelligence,
[3:16:57.620 --> 3:17:00.660]  connected to the National Intelligence Service.
[3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:03.860]  These are the people and the individuals
[3:17:03.860 --> 3:17:07.820]  that Joe Sleepy Creepin Biden and his crackhead pipe
[3:17:07.820 --> 3:17:11.140]  of a son, Hunter Biden, are connected to.
[3:17:11.140 --> 3:17:14.340]  Now, when we come back from our two to three minute break,
[3:17:14.340 --> 3:17:20.300]  concerning part two of the downfall, the coming downfall
[3:17:20.300 --> 3:17:23.180]  of one of the most corrupt families
[3:17:23.180 --> 3:17:25.260]  in American political history, it
[3:17:25.260 --> 3:17:26.660]  is going to blow your mind.
[3:17:26.660 --> 3:17:29.220]  We'll see you here in the next two to three minutes
[3:17:29.220 --> 3:17:32.020]  here with your host, Bishop Larry Gage.
[3:17:40.220 --> 3:17:44.860]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra-12 are now back in stock
[3:17:44.860 --> 3:17:46.140]  after being sold out for months.
[3:17:46.140 --> 3:17:47.660]  They're sold out because people know
[3:17:47.660 --> 3:17:50.780]  that high-quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins, minerals,
[3:17:50.780 --> 3:17:54.220]  especially zinc, boost your body's natural defenses
[3:17:54.220 --> 3:17:56.380]  and are critical to your immune system.
[3:17:56.380 --> 3:18:01.460]  Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com's
[3:18:01.460 --> 3:18:02.820]  two-week softening election.
[3:18:02.820 --> 3:18:07.140]  And we're offering them both at 50% off, free shipping,
[3:18:07.140 --> 3:18:09.460]  and triple-patriot points in your next order.
[3:18:09.460 --> 3:18:12.980]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping and additional 10% off,
[3:18:12.980 --> 3:18:15.540]  that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders.
[3:18:15.540 --> 3:18:18.140]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff
[3:18:18.140 --> 3:18:20.780]  sold out, a lot of other stuff is close to selling out.
[3:18:20.780 --> 3:18:22.580]  But some of our best sellers are still there,
[3:18:22.580 --> 3:18:24.940]  and some of them have actually come back in to stock.
[3:18:24.940 --> 3:18:27.980]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder
[3:18:27.980 --> 3:18:30.140]  and get the other things that have actually sold out.
[3:18:30.140 --> 3:18:32.100]  So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[3:18:32.100 --> 3:18:34.580]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the air.
[3:18:34.580 --> 3:18:36.260]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight,
[3:18:36.260 --> 3:18:40.820]  and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[3:18:40.820 --> 3:18:42.980]  History is now.
[3:18:42.980 --> 3:18:44.980]  History is taking place in front of us.
[3:18:44.980 --> 3:18:46.580]  We are at the crossroads.
[3:18:46.580 --> 3:18:49.260]  We are now only two weeks out from the most
[3:18:49.260 --> 3:18:51.740]  historic and important election in world history.
[3:18:51.740 --> 3:18:53.220]  I've been saying that for over a year,
[3:18:53.220 --> 3:18:55.380]  but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating.
[3:18:55.380 --> 3:18:56.460]  This is so critical.
[3:18:56.460 --> 3:18:59.140]  The New World Order wants to repudiate the nation state.
[3:18:59.140 --> 3:19:00.860]  They'll repudiate the idea of America.
[3:19:00.860 --> 3:19:03.140]  They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance
[3:19:03.140 --> 3:19:06.140]  and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy.
[3:19:06.140 --> 3:19:09.660]  So they are throwing everything they've got,
[3:19:09.660 --> 3:19:12.100]  not just the American people, but the people of the world.
[3:19:12.100 --> 3:19:15.180]  That's why your word of mouth is beyond king.
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:16.900]  It is paramount.
[3:19:16.900 --> 3:19:19.620]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos,
[3:19:19.620 --> 3:19:21.980]  when you shoot your own video, or write your own article,
[3:19:21.980 --> 3:19:23.660]  or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them,
[3:19:23.660 --> 3:19:26.180]  or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[3:19:26.180 --> 3:19:27.980]  When you speak out against the system,
[3:19:27.980 --> 3:19:30.060]  when you do things that seem little,
[3:19:30.060 --> 3:19:32.220]  together it adds up into giant things.
[3:19:32.220 --> 3:19:34.180]  Many hands make life work.
[3:19:34.180 --> 3:19:35.220]  History's happening now.
[3:19:35.220 --> 3:19:37.140]  Take action now while you still can.
[3:19:37.140 --> 3:19:39.620]  Please, for all of our futures.
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:42.220]  It's taken me two and a half years
[3:19:42.220 --> 3:19:45.180]  to finally even be able to convince Congress
[3:19:45.180 --> 3:19:48.900]  and the rest of the world that we were only the initial target
[3:19:48.900 --> 3:19:52.500]  to set the precedent for a coordinated big tech censorship.
[3:19:52.500 --> 3:19:55.180]  Now the world finally understands it.
[3:19:55.180 --> 3:19:57.180]  But we don't have two and a half years
[3:19:57.180 --> 3:19:59.780]  for the learning curve to take place this time.
[3:19:59.780 --> 3:20:02.180]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying
[3:20:02.180 --> 3:20:04.140]  the lockdown is permanent.
[3:20:04.140 --> 3:20:07.140]  It is a plan to lower carbon footprint.
[3:20:07.140 --> 3:20:10.100]  It is a plan to make the world population poor.
[3:20:10.100 --> 3:20:12.540]  It is a diabolical power grab.
[3:20:12.540 --> 3:20:15.780]  It is a revolution against the industrial revolution.
[3:20:15.780 --> 3:20:18.140]  They call it the post-industrial world.
[3:20:18.140 --> 3:20:20.020]  And it's the excuse for them to take control
[3:20:20.020 --> 3:20:21.660]  every fast of our lives
[3:20:21.660 --> 3:20:23.820]  and implement absolute authoritarianism.
[3:20:23.820 --> 3:20:25.260]  So again, everybody out there,
[3:20:25.260 --> 3:20:26.700]  if you love your children,
[3:20:26.700 --> 3:20:28.540]  like my daughter that just woke up here,
[3:20:28.540 --> 3:20:30.660]  and if you care about yourselves in any future,
[3:20:30.660 --> 3:20:32.220]  you need to get awake.
[3:20:32.220 --> 3:20:33.700]  You need to understand this information.
[3:20:33.700 --> 3:20:35.260]  You need to warn others, okay?
[3:20:35.260 --> 3:20:37.260]  It's a life-and-death situation.
[3:20:37.260 --> 3:20:39.260]  MUSIC
[3:20:42.260 --> 3:20:46.260]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:51.260 --> 3:20:53.260]  MUSIC
[3:21:00.260 --> 3:21:02.260]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show,
[3:21:02.260 --> 3:21:05.260]  the number one radio and television show
[3:21:05.260 --> 3:21:07.260]  in America and around the world.
[3:21:07.260 --> 3:21:10.260]  This is your guest host back with you,
[3:21:10.260 --> 3:21:12.260]  Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:21:12.260 --> 3:21:14.260]  During this fourth hour,
[3:21:14.260 --> 3:21:17.260]  it's such a great honor to be back
[3:21:17.260 --> 3:21:19.260]  with Brother Alex, who is my mentor.
[3:21:19.260 --> 3:21:22.260]  And I thank God for him and for his powerful staff there
[3:21:22.260 --> 3:21:24.260]  and in for wars.
[3:21:24.260 --> 3:21:26.260]  You guys are literally transforming
[3:21:26.260 --> 3:21:28.260]  and transliterating the world.
[3:21:28.260 --> 3:21:30.260]  All right, the House of Cards,
[3:21:30.260 --> 3:21:33.260]  the coming fall of the Biden-Krein family.
[3:21:33.260 --> 3:21:37.260]  I want to get into the late son of Joe Biden,
[3:21:37.260 --> 3:21:39.260]  Beau Biden.
[3:21:39.260 --> 3:21:41.260]  Now, Beau Biden at the time,
[3:21:41.260 --> 3:21:46.260]  going back during the year of 2008,
[3:21:46.260 --> 3:21:49.260]  2009, and 2011,
[3:21:49.260 --> 3:21:52.260]  Beau Biden had created
[3:21:52.260 --> 3:21:54.260]  the Beau Biden Foundation
[3:21:54.260 --> 3:21:57.260]  for the Protection of Children.
[3:21:57.260 --> 3:22:00.260]  Now, at the time in 2011,
[3:22:00.260 --> 3:22:02.260]  when his father was vice president
[3:22:02.260 --> 3:22:04.260]  of these United States for America,
[3:22:04.260 --> 3:22:07.260]  Joe Biden, Beau Biden,
[3:22:07.260 --> 3:22:09.260]  including Hunter Biden,
[3:22:09.260 --> 3:22:14.260]  in Barack Obama visited Penn State University.
[3:22:14.260 --> 3:22:15.260]  Now, one may say,
[3:22:15.260 --> 3:22:18.260]  what does this have to do with the House of Cards
[3:22:18.260 --> 3:22:22.260]  on the coming fall of the Biden-Krein family?
[3:22:22.260 --> 3:22:24.260]  Glad you asked.
[3:22:24.260 --> 3:22:30.260]  He calls Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, okay?
[3:22:30.260 --> 3:22:35.260]  And Hunter Biden and Beau Biden
[3:22:35.260 --> 3:22:38.260]  visited Penn State University
[3:22:38.260 --> 3:22:42.260]  a month before the outbreak
[3:22:42.260 --> 3:22:46.260]  of the Jerry Sandusky conspiracy.
[3:22:46.260 --> 3:22:48.260]  Now, I'm not trying to put two and two together,
[3:22:48.260 --> 3:22:50.260]  but my job here today
[3:22:50.260 --> 3:22:52.260]  is to present the facts,
[3:22:52.260 --> 3:22:54.260]  and it's up to you, the American people,
[3:22:54.260 --> 3:22:56.260]  to come up with the proper conclusions
[3:22:56.260 --> 3:22:58.260]  as we're talking about this House of Cards,
[3:22:58.260 --> 3:23:02.260]  the coming fall of the Biden-Krein family.
[3:23:02.260 --> 3:23:06.260]  So, in 2011, okay,
[3:23:06.260 --> 3:23:10.260]  going back to 2011, October 2011,
[3:23:10.260 --> 3:23:15.260]  a month before the Jerry Sandusky case went live.
[3:23:15.260 --> 3:23:20.260]  Now, Jerry Sandusky was the former assistant football coach
[3:23:20.260 --> 3:23:24.260]  under Joe Paternal, who had died,
[3:23:24.260 --> 3:23:28.260]  you know, they say of cancer, in 2012.
[3:23:28.260 --> 3:23:32.260]  So, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Beau Biden, okay,
[3:23:32.260 --> 3:23:35.260]  and Hunter Biden visited Penn State University.
[3:23:35.260 --> 3:23:37.260]  Not only met Joe Paternal,
[3:23:37.260 --> 3:23:40.260]  but met Jerry Sandusky.
[3:23:40.260 --> 3:23:44.260]  Now, Jerry Sandusky ran a foundation
[3:23:44.260 --> 3:23:47.260]  called the Extra Mile, okay,
[3:23:47.260 --> 3:23:50.260]  or the Mile 2 Foundation.
[3:23:50.260 --> 3:23:54.260]  The Extra Mile or the Mile 2 Foundation
[3:23:54.260 --> 3:23:56.260]  had many names.
[3:23:56.260 --> 3:23:59.260]  Going back to 2008, many of these individuals
[3:23:59.260 --> 3:24:02.260]  were connected to the life, the financial
[3:24:02.260 --> 3:24:06.260]  and the political life of one Joseph Robinette Biden,
[3:24:06.260 --> 3:24:10.260]  concerning the Biden's connection
[3:24:10.260 --> 3:24:13.260]  to Robert Allen Stanford
[3:24:13.260 --> 3:24:15.260]  in the Stanford Financial Equity Fund,
[3:24:15.260 --> 3:24:19.260]  including the Paradigm Financial Equity Group,
[3:24:19.260 --> 3:24:24.260]  and including the connection to the Mooneys
[3:24:24.260 --> 3:24:28.260]  out of South Korea, okay, to James Park.
[3:24:28.260 --> 3:24:29.260]  Wait a minute now.
[3:24:29.260 --> 3:24:35.260]  So, Jerry Sandusky, who is serving a 30- to 60-year prison term,
[3:24:35.260 --> 3:24:38.260]  was connected to Joe Biden
[3:24:38.260 --> 3:24:42.260]  and connected to the Robert Allen Stanford Equity Fund,
[3:24:42.260 --> 3:24:47.260]  because many executives who sat on
[3:24:47.260 --> 3:24:50.260]  the Jerry Sandusky Foundation,
[3:24:50.260 --> 3:24:52.260]  the Extra Mile Foundation,
[3:24:52.260 --> 3:24:56.260]  also sat on the board of Burisma,
[3:24:56.260 --> 3:25:01.260]  sat on the board, okay, of Rosemont Seneca,
[3:25:01.260 --> 3:25:04.260]  sat on the board, okay,
[3:25:04.260 --> 3:25:08.260]  of the Bahia Harvest International Group out of China.
[3:25:08.260 --> 3:25:09.260]  Wait a minute now.
[3:25:09.260 --> 3:25:13.260]  What does Jerry Sandusky and his executive,
[3:25:13.260 --> 3:25:15.260]  former executive foundation,
[3:25:15.260 --> 3:25:17.260]  call the Extra Mile Foundation,
[3:25:17.260 --> 3:25:20.260]  have anything to do with Joe Biden?
[3:25:20.260 --> 3:25:24.260]  Because when Jerry Sandusky was exposed,
[3:25:24.260 --> 3:25:27.260]  Joe Biden, under the direction of Barack Hussein
[3:25:27.260 --> 3:25:30.260]  with a thousand different elices of Obama,
[3:25:30.260 --> 3:25:35.260]  was mum concerning both Joe Praternal and Jerry Sandusky, okay?
[3:25:35.260 --> 3:25:40.260]  And so, the Beau Biden Foundation, okay,
[3:25:40.260 --> 3:25:43.260]  the Foundation for the Protection of Children,
[3:25:43.260 --> 3:25:47.260]  had on its executive board, Hunter Biden.
[3:25:47.260 --> 3:25:50.260]  Now, when you look at the logo there,
[3:25:50.260 --> 3:25:53.260]  of the Beau Foundation,
[3:25:53.260 --> 3:25:55.260]  the Beau Biden Foundation,
[3:25:55.260 --> 3:26:00.260]  which they have, have a PO box,
[3:26:00.260 --> 3:26:02.260]  78, 19, now wait a minute,
[3:26:02.260 --> 3:26:03.260]  now I'm confused now.
[3:26:03.260 --> 3:26:08.260]  If this foundation is the conduit for millions of dollars,
[3:26:08.260 --> 3:26:12.260]  why is Joe Biden, Hunter Biden in the Biden family,
[3:26:12.260 --> 3:26:16.260]  why don't they have a regular address?
[3:26:16.260 --> 3:26:22.260]  It is a shell company for the conduit of millions of dollars,
[3:26:22.260 --> 3:26:27.260]  okay, for child pedophilia and child sacrifice.
[3:26:27.260 --> 3:26:28.260]  Now, somebody said,
[3:26:28.260 --> 3:26:29.260]  well, Bishop, you have lost your mind.
[3:26:29.260 --> 3:26:30.260]  I don't think so.
[3:26:30.260 --> 3:26:33.260]  Because this Joe Biden bloodline
[3:26:33.260 --> 3:26:38.260]  that goes back 78 generations of slave owners
[3:26:38.260 --> 3:26:41.260]  out of Scotland, out of England,
[3:26:41.260 --> 3:26:44.260]  migrating to Delaware and Maryland
[3:26:44.260 --> 3:26:47.260]  during the early part of the 1800s,
[3:26:47.260 --> 3:26:52.260]  who were also members of the odd fellow's secret society
[3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:55.260]  for another topic, for another day.
[3:26:55.260 --> 3:27:03.260]  Now, the EIN number, the employer identification number
[3:27:03.260 --> 3:27:12.260]  for the Beau Biden Foundation is 47-450-7397,
[3:27:12.260 --> 3:27:14.260]  which they specialize in
[3:27:14.260 --> 3:27:17.260]  for the prevention of child abuse and sexual abuse.
[3:27:17.260 --> 3:27:19.260]  But yet at the same time,
[3:27:19.260 --> 3:27:23.260]  they have a pervert on their executive board.
[3:27:23.260 --> 3:27:25.260]  This crack kid, Hunter Biden.
[3:27:25.260 --> 3:27:29.260]  Now, Hunter Biden is exposed now
[3:27:29.260 --> 3:27:31.260]  because of this laptop, okay,
[3:27:31.260 --> 3:27:35.260]  in connection not just to money laundering,
[3:27:35.260 --> 3:27:41.260]  okay, in connection to barisma out of keyed in the Ukraine
[3:27:41.260 --> 3:27:46.260]  and also being connected to Chinese intelligence.
[3:27:46.260 --> 3:27:49.260]  But Hunter, by excellent picture there, guys,
[3:27:49.260 --> 3:27:52.260]  Hunter Biden, along with his father,
[3:27:52.260 --> 3:27:59.260]  were complicit in nationalizing the private bank
[3:27:59.260 --> 3:28:02.260]  out of keyed in the Ukraine.
[3:28:02.260 --> 3:28:06.260]  Now, when we're talking about the coming fall
[3:28:06.260 --> 3:28:11.260]  of the crime family called the Biden crime family,
[3:28:11.260 --> 3:28:15.260]  let's look again at the life of Jerry Sandusky
[3:28:15.260 --> 3:28:18.260]  in connection to Joe Biden,
[3:28:18.260 --> 3:28:23.260]  whom Joe Biden met Jerry Sandusky a month before
[3:28:23.260 --> 3:28:28.260]  that Jerry Sandusky conspiracy was exposed.
[3:28:28.260 --> 3:28:34.260]  Now, in connection of Biden money to a man
[3:28:34.260 --> 3:28:38.260]  buying the name, going back to 1917.
[3:28:38.260 --> 3:28:40.260]  Now, what I'm about to ready to reveal to you
[3:28:40.260 --> 3:28:43.260]  is going to absolutely blow your minds
[3:28:43.260 --> 3:28:45.260]  as we're talking about the coming fall
[3:28:45.260 --> 3:28:48.260]  of the Biden crime family.
[3:28:48.260 --> 3:28:52.260]  Now, as we go back to 1972,
[3:28:52.260 --> 3:28:58.260]  there was a Pakistani billionaire, a financier,
[3:28:58.260 --> 3:29:02.260]  by the name of Agha Hassan Abidi,
[3:29:02.260 --> 3:29:10.260]  capital A-G-H-A-H-A-S-A-N Hassan Abidi,
[3:29:10.260 --> 3:29:13.260]  capital A-B-E-D-I.
[3:29:13.260 --> 3:29:18.260]  He created in 1972
[3:29:18.260 --> 3:29:23.260]  one of the most corrupt banks in world history,
[3:29:23.260 --> 3:29:27.260]  the BCCI Bank,
[3:29:27.260 --> 3:29:32.260]  the private bank that is connected
[3:29:32.260 --> 3:29:36.260]  to Chinese intelligence, to the Mossad,
[3:29:36.260 --> 3:29:39.260]  excellent length there, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:29:39.260 --> 3:29:43.260]  from the Mossad to the CIA to the KGB
[3:29:43.260 --> 3:29:46.260]  and Pakistani intelligence.
[3:29:46.260 --> 3:29:51.260]  So the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
[3:29:51.260 --> 3:29:56.260]  with Hassan Abidi personally finance
[3:29:56.260 --> 3:30:04.260]  the political career of Joseph Biden in 1972,
[3:30:04.260 --> 3:30:08.260]  which was the same year that his wife,
[3:30:08.260 --> 3:30:11.260]  Nelia Hunter Biden, was involved
[3:30:11.260 --> 3:30:14.260]  in a horrific car crash
[3:30:14.260 --> 3:30:18.260]  that also had killed their daughter Naomi.
[3:30:18.260 --> 3:30:20.260]  Now, when we come back in the third segment,
[3:30:20.260 --> 3:30:22.260]  we're going to connect these political lay lines
[3:30:22.260 --> 3:30:25.260]  concerning the House of Cards
[3:30:25.260 --> 3:30:39.260]  and the coming fall of the Biden crime ban.
[3:30:39.260 --> 3:30:40.260]  As I take this announcement,
[3:30:40.260 --> 3:30:43.260]  we were exactly 14 days out from the election
[3:30:43.260 --> 3:30:45.260]  and the globalist-controlled Democrats
[3:30:45.260 --> 3:30:47.260]  know that America has woken up to them
[3:30:47.260 --> 3:30:48.260]  and turned against them.
[3:30:48.260 --> 3:30:51.260]  But the whole planet is a huge populist realignment
[3:30:51.260 --> 3:30:53.260]  and so they've openly said,
[3:30:53.260 --> 3:30:55.260]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism,
[3:30:55.260 --> 3:30:58.260]  not just censorship, but physically attacking
[3:30:58.260 --> 3:31:01.260]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[3:31:01.260 --> 3:31:04.260]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump,
[3:31:04.260 --> 3:31:07.260]  they are going to persecute Trump's base
[3:31:07.260 --> 3:31:10.260]  and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[3:31:10.260 --> 3:31:14.260]  This is what all the old Clintinesis are saying.
[3:31:14.260 --> 3:31:16.260]  It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[3:31:16.260 --> 3:31:18.260]  It's what Keith Overman's saying.
[3:31:18.260 --> 3:31:20.260]  It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[3:31:20.260 --> 3:31:24.260]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent
[3:31:24.260 --> 3:31:27.260]  and they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever
[3:31:27.260 --> 3:31:28.260]  and force denoculations.
[3:31:28.260 --> 3:31:30.260]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns
[3:31:30.260 --> 3:31:32.260]  and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[3:31:32.260 --> 3:31:34.260]  Donald Trump or die.
[3:31:34.260 --> 3:31:36.260]  You've got to get Trump in.
[3:31:36.260 --> 3:31:37.260]  Everybody get out there and vote
[3:31:37.260 --> 3:31:39.260]  and tell your family to vote now.
[3:31:39.260 --> 3:31:41.260]  Black Friday in October.
[3:31:41.260 --> 3:31:43.260]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales
[3:31:43.260 --> 3:31:46.260]  that we ran in the last couple weeks of October
[3:31:46.260 --> 3:31:48.260]  and it was popular for a reason.
[3:31:48.260 --> 3:31:53.260]  The biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October
[3:31:53.260 --> 3:31:56.260]  and that means 30% to 60% off store-wide free shipping,
[3:31:56.260 --> 3:32:00.260]  triple-patriot points, that's 15% off your next order.

[3:32:02.260 --> 3:32:05.260]  that makes many of these items lost leaders.
[3:32:05.260 --> 3:32:06.260]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out,
[3:32:06.260 --> 3:32:08.260]  some of our best sellers are still there,
[3:32:08.260 --> 3:32:09.260]  but some good news.

[3:32:11.260 --> 3:32:13.260]  and all the other vitamins and minerals and amino acids

[3:32:25.260 --> 3:32:27.260]  highest quality 5 and B12,
[3:32:27.260 --> 3:32:30.260]  take it under the tongue for full absorption,
[3:32:30.260 --> 3:32:31.260]  it is now back in stock.

[3:32:35.260 --> 3:32:37.260]  infowarstore.com.
[3:32:37.260 --> 3:32:39.260]  Black Friday comes in October.
[3:32:40.260 --> 3:32:44.260]  If you pay close attention to what big tech is actually saying
[3:32:44.260 --> 3:32:46.260]  and more importantly what they're actually doing,
[3:32:46.260 --> 3:32:50.260]  when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[3:32:50.260 --> 3:32:53.260]  that was a test to see if they could work in concert
[3:32:53.260 --> 3:32:56.260]  to totally suppress information,
[3:32:56.260 --> 3:32:58.260]  because they've also been on record saying
[3:32:58.260 --> 3:33:00.260]  coming up on election day and thereafter,
[3:33:00.260 --> 3:33:02.260]  they're not going to let anyone but, quote,
[3:33:02.260 --> 3:33:05.260]  authoritative sources, that means CNN, New York Times,
[3:33:05.260 --> 3:33:09.260]  what a joke, come out and say who the real winner is.
[3:33:09.260 --> 3:33:10.260]  That way they can contest the election,
[3:33:10.260 --> 3:33:12.260]  even though Trump's declare winner,
[3:33:12.260 --> 3:33:14.260]  hold everything up with the ballots,
[3:33:14.260 --> 3:33:16.260]  then cause a constitutional crisis,
[3:33:16.260 --> 3:33:18.260]  halt for secession, and have the U.N. come in
[3:33:18.260 --> 3:33:20.260]  and declare the election for Biden.
[3:33:20.260 --> 3:33:23.260]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[3:33:23.260 --> 3:33:25.260]  And so when you see them in concert,
[3:33:25.260 --> 3:33:27.260]  censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[3:33:27.260 --> 3:33:29.260]  that is a drill, that is a test,
[3:33:29.260 --> 3:33:31.260]  to get all their systems ready,
[3:33:31.260 --> 3:33:34.260]  but also to condition the public that big tech works in unison
[3:33:34.260 --> 3:33:36.260]  to suppress speech and information.
[3:33:36.260 --> 3:33:40.260]  This is election meddling 101, this is illegal.
[3:33:40.260 --> 3:33:43.260]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[3:33:43.260 --> 3:33:46.260]  And in the future, keeping your humanity,
[3:33:46.260 --> 3:33:50.260]  saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence,
[3:33:50.260 --> 3:33:52.260]  is going to be your most valuable asset.
[3:33:52.260 --> 3:33:55.260]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[3:33:55.260 --> 3:33:58.260]  The world being built by the technocrats,
[3:33:58.260 --> 3:34:00.260]  and the trap they've now sprung
[3:34:00.260 --> 3:34:03.260]  with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown
[3:34:03.260 --> 3:34:05.260]  is the beginning of the process
[3:34:05.260 --> 3:34:07.260]  of taking us past domestication
[3:34:07.260 --> 3:34:11.260]  into total and complete dehumanization.
[3:34:11.260 --> 3:34:15.260]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out
[3:34:15.260 --> 3:34:19.260]  in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[3:34:19.260 --> 3:34:21.260]  This is their stated goal.
[3:34:21.260 --> 3:34:24.260]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you,
[3:34:24.260 --> 3:34:27.260]  but only by facing the horror
[3:34:27.260 --> 3:34:30.260]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy
[3:34:30.260 --> 3:34:32.260]  when we turn this around.
[3:34:32.260 --> 3:34:34.260]  You must study their own writings,
[3:34:34.260 --> 3:34:37.260]  you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[3:34:37.260 --> 3:35:06.260]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[3:35:07.260 --> 3:35:09.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show,
[3:35:09.260 --> 3:35:11.260]  the number one radio and television show in America
[3:35:11.260 --> 3:35:13.260]  and around the world with your hosts
[3:35:13.260 --> 3:35:16.260]  and moderator, Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:35:16.260 --> 3:35:19.260]  We're talking about the coming fall
[3:35:19.260 --> 3:35:22.260]  of the Joe Biden crying family,
[3:35:22.260 --> 3:35:25.260]  House of Cards, the coming fall of the Biden crying family.
[3:35:25.260 --> 3:35:28.260]  Now, we've left off with this corrupt bank
[3:35:28.260 --> 3:35:32.260]  that I want to talk about for the next two to three minutes,
[3:35:32.260 --> 3:35:34.260]  this VCCI bank.
[3:35:34.260 --> 3:35:37.260]  Now, remember the 2009 movie with Clive Owen
[3:35:37.260 --> 3:35:40.260]  entitled The International is based,
[3:35:40.260 --> 3:35:45.260]  was based upon this particular bank,
[3:35:45.260 --> 3:35:48.260]  which is now defunct the Bank of Credit and Commercial
[3:35:48.260 --> 3:35:51.260]  International or Internationale,
[3:35:51.260 --> 3:35:54.260]  which was a creature of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[3:35:54.260 --> 3:35:58.260]  So then Joe Biden is a creature of the CIA.
[3:35:58.260 --> 3:36:03.260]  Now, Joe Biden, his connection with the VCCI bank
[3:36:03.260 --> 3:36:07.260]  are the Karachi in Pakistan,
[3:36:07.260 --> 3:36:10.260]  which its international headquarters at the time
[3:36:10.260 --> 3:36:13.260]  was in the nation called Luxembourg,
[3:36:13.260 --> 3:36:19.260]  which also financed later the SNL scandal
[3:36:19.260 --> 3:36:22.260]  that was connected to the Clintons to Jimmy Carter
[3:36:22.260 --> 3:36:25.260]  to John McCain, who was a traitor,
[3:36:25.260 --> 3:36:28.260]  including one Joe Biden.
[3:36:28.260 --> 3:36:34.260]  And so then, now that brings us to the Burisma Holdings group
[3:36:34.260 --> 3:36:37.260]  out of Kyiv in the Ukraine.
[3:36:37.260 --> 3:36:44.260]  Now, there is a man by the name of Nikola Slavesky.
[3:36:44.260 --> 3:36:50.260]  Now, Nikola Slavesky is connected to the bloodline
[3:36:50.260 --> 3:36:54.260]  out of Latvia, going back to the year 1705,
[3:36:54.260 --> 3:36:56.260]  to the Kirchner family.
[3:36:56.260 --> 3:37:01.260]  Now, I'm not saying that the term Kirchner concerning
[3:37:01.260 --> 3:37:04.260]  the son-in-law of our president is connected to this,
[3:37:04.260 --> 3:37:06.260]  and he is not.
[3:37:06.260 --> 3:37:13.260]  I'm just saying that the bloodline of one Nikola Slavesky
[3:37:13.260 --> 3:37:18.260]  goes back to 1705 to out of Latvia,
[3:37:18.260 --> 3:37:22.260]  which their original name was the Kirchner family,
[3:37:22.260 --> 3:37:28.260]  Kappa K-U-S-H-N-I-R, which later was changed to N-E-R
[3:37:28.260 --> 3:37:31.260]  during the early part of the 1800s.
[3:37:31.260 --> 3:37:35.260]  So Nikola Slavesky, excellent picture there,
[3:37:35.260 --> 3:37:40.260]  ladies and gentlemen, concerning Burisma Bank.
[3:37:40.260 --> 3:37:45.260]  Now, Burisma Bank is the epicenter of this corruption
[3:37:45.260 --> 3:37:51.260]  surrounding one Joe Biden because he wanted the private bank
[3:37:51.260 --> 3:37:56.260]  that was created by Nikola Slavesky to be nationalized
[3:37:56.260 --> 3:37:58.260]  in 2016.
[3:37:58.260 --> 3:38:04.260]  Why? Because Joe Biden wanted to hide his complicit connection
[3:38:04.260 --> 3:38:08.260]  into money laundering, which is also on the laptop
[3:38:08.260 --> 3:38:12.260]  of one crackhead Hunter Biden, another topic for another day.
[3:38:12.260 --> 3:38:18.260]  Now, the Biden family, their money is closely connected
[3:38:18.260 --> 3:38:23.260]  to Chinese intelligence, okay, to a man by the name
[3:38:23.260 --> 3:38:29.260]  of Qin Wengi, okay, capital W-E-N-Q-I-N-G.
[3:38:29.260 --> 3:38:32.260]  So Qin Wengi, ladies and gentlemen, as we're talking
[3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:37.260]  about laying this foundation concerning the House of Cards,
[3:38:37.260 --> 3:38:42.260]  the coming fall of the Biden crime family and syndicate.
[3:38:42.260 --> 3:38:47.260]  So the Bank of China, the agricultural bank of China,
[3:38:47.260 --> 3:38:52.260]  the China Construction Bank, and the industrial
[3:38:52.260 --> 3:38:57.260]  and commercial bank of China all have not just Chinese
[3:38:57.260 --> 3:39:00.260]  intelligence money, but also Mossad money
[3:39:00.260 --> 3:39:04.260]  and Pakistani intelligence money, including money
[3:39:04.260 --> 3:39:06.260]  through the Biden family.
[3:39:06.260 --> 3:39:10.260]  I told you at the very beginning of today's broadcast
[3:39:10.260 --> 3:39:14.260]  that Joe Biden and his family is the greatest,
[3:39:14.260 --> 3:39:18.260]  is the worst corrupt family in American political history.
[3:39:18.260 --> 3:39:23.260]  So Joe Biden's connection to Chinese intelligence,
[3:39:23.260 --> 3:39:26.260]  to the Ministry of State Security, which is the Chinese
[3:39:26.260 --> 3:39:29.260]  equivalent of the American CI to Qin Wengi,
[3:39:29.260 --> 3:39:34.260]  who is the head of the Ministry of State Security, okay?
[3:39:34.260 --> 3:39:39.260]  So the Ministry of State Security in the Biden family
[3:39:39.260 --> 3:39:44.260]  with Hunter Biden owning 10% of a Chinese equity group
[3:39:45.260 --> 3:39:50.260]  out of Shanghai, China, called the Bahia Harvest Group.
[3:39:50.260 --> 3:39:54.260]  Now in connection to the Paradigm Global Advisory Group
[3:39:54.260 --> 3:39:58.260]  and the connection to the Rosemont Seneca Group,
[3:39:58.260 --> 3:40:03.260]  which was created by Christopher Hite,
[3:40:03.260 --> 3:40:08.260]  the stepson of one John Kerry, okay?
[3:40:08.260 --> 3:40:12.260]  So Christopher Hines, Devin Archer and Hunter Biden
[3:40:12.260 --> 3:40:17.260]  had created the Rosemont Seneca Equity Firm in 2009,
[3:40:18.260 --> 3:40:22.260]  which is also connected to Ukrainian uranium
[3:40:22.260 --> 3:40:27.260]  and to the Russian uranium deal, which this Jezebel,
[3:40:27.260 --> 3:40:31.260]  okay, Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama
[3:40:31.260 --> 3:40:38.260]  or there is so tall rope, gave away so 20% of American uranium,
[3:40:38.260 --> 3:40:43.260]  which thereby President Putin kicked back a check
[3:40:43.260 --> 3:40:46.260]  for $145 million to who?
[3:40:46.260 --> 3:40:50.260]  To the Clinton Foundation and to the Clinton Global Initiative.
[3:40:50.260 --> 3:40:53.260]  You're dealing with devils as we're talking about
[3:40:53.260 --> 3:40:58.260]  this House of Cards, the coming fall of the Biden crime family.
[3:40:58.260 --> 3:41:02.260]  Now in our conclusion, Joe Biden's connection
[3:41:02.260 --> 3:41:06.260]  to a major corporation out of China entitled
[3:41:06.260 --> 3:41:11.260]  the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation,
[3:41:11.260 --> 3:41:14.260]  that's ran, you got it, by Chinese intelligence,
[3:41:14.260 --> 3:41:16.260]  by the Ministry of State Security,
[3:41:16.260 --> 3:41:20.260]  which is the Chinese equivalent of the American CIA.
[3:41:20.260 --> 3:41:25.260]  This also is connected to the Paradigm Global Advisory Group,
[3:41:25.260 --> 3:41:29.260]  connected to the Rosemont Seneca Partners Group,
[3:41:29.260 --> 3:41:32.260]  which is ran by the Biden family,
[3:41:32.260 --> 3:41:37.260]  who are then connected to a man by the name of Tom Scoldo,
[3:41:37.260 --> 3:41:40.260]  capital S-C-O-T-O.
[3:41:40.260 --> 3:41:43.260]  Well, he's a fixer, okay?
[3:41:43.260 --> 3:41:45.260]  Tom Scoldo was the former president
[3:41:45.260 --> 3:41:49.260]  of New York's Detectives Endowment Association Union
[3:41:49.260 --> 3:41:53.260]  that's connected to the old Tammity Hall, okay?
[3:41:53.260 --> 3:41:55.260]  Going back to 2002.
[3:41:55.260 --> 3:42:00.260]  So Tom Scoldo is the unindicted,
[3:42:00.260 --> 3:42:02.260]  notice these legal terms,
[3:42:02.260 --> 3:42:09.260]  the unindicted co-conspirator by federal prosecutors, okay?
[3:42:09.260 --> 3:42:12.260]  And connection to organized crime.
[3:42:12.260 --> 3:42:16.260]  So Tom Scoldo, his connection to Joe Biden,
[3:42:16.260 --> 3:42:21.260]  these two gentlemen are connected to the Locazi family
[3:42:21.260 --> 3:42:25.260]  and the Gambino family here in New York City.
[3:42:25.260 --> 3:42:29.260]  But yet, Joe Biden wants us to elect him
[3:42:29.260 --> 3:42:31.260]  to be the president of the United States.
[3:42:31.260 --> 3:42:32.260]  It's not going to happen.
[3:42:32.260 --> 3:42:36.260]  Now, in my conclusion, in 2004,
[3:42:36.260 --> 3:42:39.260]  Joe Biden sat on the board
[3:42:39.260 --> 3:42:46.260]  of the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Group.
[3:42:46.260 --> 3:42:47.260]  Wait a minute now.
[3:42:47.260 --> 3:42:52.260]  The same Bernie Madoff, whose real name goes back to the 1600s,
[3:42:52.260 --> 3:42:56.260]  out of Lafayette, okay, and later Poland,
[3:42:56.260 --> 3:43:06.260]  the Mio Doudniki family, company M-O-I-M-I-O-D-O-W-N-I-K-I,
[3:43:06.260 --> 3:43:11.260]  which that bloodline is related to the Wabanit family
[3:43:11.260 --> 3:43:17.260]  into which the bloodline of Joe Biden married into
[3:43:17.260 --> 3:43:19.260]  during the mid-1800s.
[3:43:19.260 --> 3:43:23.260]  These are corrupt devils, okay,
[3:43:23.260 --> 3:43:26.260]  concerning the House of Cards,
[3:43:26.260 --> 3:43:31.260]  the coming fall of the crime family,
[3:43:31.260 --> 3:43:34.260]  this crime syndicate called the Biden family.
[3:43:34.260 --> 3:43:36.260]  Now, in my conclusion,
[3:43:36.260 --> 3:43:41.260]  so then the Bidens, they're also connected to a monster
[3:43:41.260 --> 3:43:49.260]  by the name of Anthony V. Lotito, capital L-O-T-I-T-O.
[3:43:49.260 --> 3:43:52.260]  He's connected to the Gambino crime family,
[3:43:52.260 --> 3:43:57.260]  to the Bonanno crime family, and to the Lucchese family.
[3:43:57.260 --> 3:44:02.260]  He runs the J.P. Lotito and company here in New York City,
[3:44:02.260 --> 3:44:06.260]  whereby he co-created along with James Biden,
[3:44:06.260 --> 3:44:08.260]  the younger brother of Joe Biden,
[3:44:08.260 --> 3:44:12.260]  the Globetts Financial Advisory Group,
[3:44:12.260 --> 3:44:18.260]  and the Lion Hog Group, which is now owned by James Biden,
[3:44:18.260 --> 3:44:24.260]  who also owns the AmeriCorps International Securities Group,
[3:44:24.260 --> 3:44:29.260]  which is a shell company for foreign money, okay?
[3:44:29.260 --> 3:44:34.260]  Now, in my conclusion here, we have to say that the Biden family
[3:44:34.260 --> 3:44:38.260]  is one of the most corrupt families in American political history.
[3:44:38.260 --> 3:44:45.260]  And also, Joe Biden, he was connected to the VCCI scandal in the 1970s,
[3:44:45.260 --> 3:44:50.260]  including the SNL scandal with Charles Keating, okay,
[3:44:50.260 --> 3:44:54.260]  along with Michael Milken, connected to the savings,
[3:44:54.260 --> 3:44:57.260]  Lincoln savings alone conspiracy,
[3:44:57.260 --> 3:45:02.260]  including John Sellout McCain, the Bush family,
[3:45:02.260 --> 3:45:07.260]  and John Kerry, who is connected to the late mobster, okay?
[3:45:07.260 --> 3:45:12.260]  And this is going to blow your mind to the late mobster, okay?
[3:45:12.260 --> 3:45:18.260]  Whitey Bolger. They're all complicit in these house accords,
[3:45:18.260 --> 3:45:21.260]  the coming fall of the Biden family.
[3:45:21.260 --> 3:45:27.260]  And I thank you. Have a wonderful day.
