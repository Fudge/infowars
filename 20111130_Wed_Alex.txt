[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:23.120]  Texas alex jones
[00:24.840 --> 00:29.320]  we are live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us it is the
[00:29.320 --> 00:35.280]  30th day of November 2011 we're gonna be here for the next three hours
[00:35.280 --> 00:40.680]  Lyndon LaRouche a geopolitical analyst and historian former presidential
[00:40.680 --> 00:44.000]  candidate will be joining us coming up in the second hour syndicated radio
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.560]  host Eric Mankal Moller will also be joining us and of course General
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.800]  Hamid Ghul is going to be joining us for the next 30 minutes they did pass the
[00:54.800 --> 00:59.200]  bill in the Senate to secretly arrest US citizens and never be seen again
[00:59.200 --> 01:03.840]  and to use the military on the streets of America they've overthrown posse
[01:03.840 --> 01:08.840]  commentatus with this if the president signs it he says he's gonna veto it you
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.280]  know why he's gonna veto it he says he has the power outside of Congress he
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.960]  can already arrest citizens and send him to Guantanamo Bay so don't think his
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.480]  veto means anything this is basically the executive in the legislative fighting
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.560]  with each other now they're trying to pass a bill for total torture so the
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.480]  entire Republic is being overthrown right now Federal Reserve is going to bail
[01:30.480 --> 01:35.280]  out its European bank owners that's all coming up incredible things are
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.540]  unfolding but our audience listening on XM AM FM shortwave satellite info
[01:40.540 --> 01:46.160]  wars.com is you're really lucky and blessed to be able to hear from General
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.280]  Hamid Ghul he is a retired general who's service director general of the
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.720]  inner service intelligence ISI Pakistani intelligence the premier
[01:54.720 --> 01:58.680]  intelligence agency in that country between a789 winning the war against the
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.440]  Russians during the late stages of the Soviet Afghan war he was involved in the
[02:03.440 --> 02:08.000]  whole thing of course and was involved in the war with India as a frontline tank
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.560]  commander before that in his younger years and he joins us now those ten years
[02:13.560 --> 02:17.080]  ahead of the ISI coincided with Benazir Budo's term as the prime minister of
[02:17.080 --> 02:22.240]  Pakistan and he joins us now to break down the incredible developments we'll
[02:22.240 --> 02:24.880]  talk more about it the next segment with the Russians saying they're going to
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.840]  block the roads in from the other side into Afghanistan Pakistan blocking the
[02:29.840 --> 02:37.480]  main supplier out into Afghanistan Russian warships going up by Syria because
[02:37.480 --> 02:41.280]  Russia recognizes the banks that run this country are desperate they want to
[02:41.280 --> 02:45.760]  start a global war to cover up all their their criminal activity General
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.040]  Ghul we only got a few minutes we're gonna come back from break but it's good
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.000]  to have you with us in a two-minute summation are we creeping closer to
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.720]  World War three I hope not I hope not I don't think we are going to go over the
[02:59.720 --> 03:06.520]  brink Pakistan but also I'm sure exercise sobriety in the end but it is
[03:06.520 --> 03:11.320]  only a paradigm shift which is needed on part of America which is going to pull
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.240]  us out of this quite mad so we have to wait and see how American policymakers
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.480]  because they never stop surprising me they shoot themselves in the foot every
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.040]  now and then and this is almost critical period they have to pull out from
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.320]  Afghanistan they lost the war and I don't know why they are doing all this so
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.280]  really we have to show that because there is a possibility as you very
[03:37.280 --> 03:43.160]  rightly said but we could go to war because of Israel and India not because
[03:43.160 --> 03:46.960]  of America not because Americans want this to happen to one of their
[03:46.960 --> 03:52.760]  conscious allies Pakistan no not at all because that is not in their interest
[03:52.760 --> 03:57.720]  but who's interest is being served in this case it's amazing that Americans
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.800]  are paying in blood and money and in their reputation in all the dreams that
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.560]  Americans have been harboring they have to pay a huge price simply to satisfy
[04:08.560 --> 04:15.920]  some of those spoiled child children but two of them mainly Israel because
[04:15.920 --> 04:19.680]  Israel is brought India on board and so on so forth so you've got to be very
[04:19.680 --> 04:25.360]  careful that we don't go over the bank. General Hamid Ghul again is our guest
[04:25.360 --> 04:30.240]  and he's gonna be with us for two long segments coming up after this break and
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.280]  we'll recap all of this general and get into the incredible developments why
[04:34.280 --> 04:39.080]  would they attack that Pakistani military base and kill more than 24 people
[04:39.080 --> 04:44.360]  will cover that with really the top expert. The establishment hates their
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.200]  former ally General Hamid Ghul so much they've called him the real head of
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.560]  al-Qaeda which of course is a complete fabricated joke we know al-Qaeda has
[04:52.560 --> 04:55.880]  been given control of Libya and is now attacking Syria and works for the
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.840]  globalist we'll be right back.

[06:00.880 --> 06:05.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[06:05.720 --> 06:10.280]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda
[06:10.280 --> 06:14.240]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[06:14.240 --> 06:18.880]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[06:18.880 --> 06:23.520]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:23.520 --> 06:27.880]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:27.880 --> 06:33.160]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:33.160 --> 06:37.440]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists
[06:37.440 --> 06:40.960]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[06:40.960 --> 06:46.200]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[06:46.200 --> 06:51.840]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[08:00.160 --> 08:05.400]  This is communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.400 --> 08:18.120]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:18.120 --> 08:23.320]  We are back ladies and gentlemen and we've got a very important guest right out
[08:23.320 --> 08:31.520]  of the gauge today. It is Wednesday the 30th day of November 2011 and four days
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.800]  ago, today's the fifth day, there was an attack on another Pakistani military base
[08:35.800 --> 08:43.560]  killing at least 24 people and injuring scores of others. There are NATO, CIA, US
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.840]  Army drones flying around all over the place killing people in Pakistan,
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.840]  Afghanistan, you name it. Total battle them and attempted to destabilize the
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.520]  country and General Hamid Ghul, former head of the Pakistani ISI, former
[08:57.520 --> 09:01.800]  frontline commander also in a war with India decades before that, really the
[09:01.800 --> 09:07.080]  mastermind behind beating the Russians. A former big US ally has been called by
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.440]  major publications the real head of al Qaeda and that's just of course absolutely
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.560]  asinine and he joins us now to I mean we couldn't get any better expert. He's the
[09:17.560 --> 09:20.840]  one of the main experts over in Pakistan on their national television. We
[09:20.840 --> 09:24.640]  couldn't get a better expert who's been there and seen it at every level to break
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.280]  down what's really going on and in the times he's joined us in the last four
[09:28.280 --> 09:33.200]  years, he's always given us accurate assessments. We're getting the truth from
[09:33.200 --> 09:37.600]  General Ghul, something we don't get from our occupied government and so
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.440]  breaking down what this attack means, the supply lines being shut down for
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.600]  Pakistan into Afghanistan, the Russians shutting down supply lines, Russia
[09:46.600 --> 09:51.040]  threatening yesterday to attack Poland. They said you know what go ahead and move
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.640]  your missiles in. We're going to go ahead and attack. Go ahead and do it. I mean
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.240]  this is huge escalations so General Hamid Ghul, General Ghul joins us. Sir
[10:01.240 --> 10:05.280]  you've got the floor, break down what happened with the attack, the incredible
[10:05.280 --> 10:11.240]  anger in Pakistan, the hardening of the line there in Pakistan, why you think
[10:11.240 --> 10:16.960]  this happened and where it basically brings the world right now. Well we can
[10:16.960 --> 10:21.920]  speculate on this Alex and the first hypothesis as we call it in the military
[10:21.920 --> 10:27.160]  the first possibility is that they want to extend war into Pakistan because
[10:27.160 --> 10:32.080]  they've been always calling AFPAR battlefield. Now naturally they have been
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.760]  using their drones indiscriminately killing nearly 3,500 people and most of
[10:38.760 --> 10:43.360]  them very innocent people really. There may be just a couple of dozen Al-Qaeda
[10:43.360 --> 10:47.800]  operators there and low-level operators. There was no high-level operator except
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.640]  one or two. The rest of the people were innocent Pakistani women and children
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.880]  and their cattle and their properties all have been destroyed because of drone
[10:56.880 --> 11:04.160]  attacks but unfortunately in spite of Pakistan's democratic institution
[11:04.160 --> 11:09.520]  coming out very strongly unanimously to stop the drone attacks requesting the
[11:09.520 --> 11:13.360]  Americans to stop them they never stop them because they don't respect
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.280]  democracy in Pakistan. This is the problem so gradually the democratic
[11:19.280 --> 11:26.640]  institution began to to lose their image in the eyes of the people and army's
[11:26.640 --> 11:33.200]  image is going up as it decides to say okay we will confront the Americans if
[11:33.200 --> 11:38.920]  necessary. So in fact it has damaged democracy in Pakistan so much but this
[11:38.920 --> 11:46.280]  particular attack it was the final nail in the coffin of our relationship. Why
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.800]  did they do that? That's the first hypothesis that I was saying that they
[11:51.800 --> 11:57.000]  want to extend war into it would be madness of the first order because that
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.040]  will push Pakistan into the lap of China for all you can determine politically
[12:03.040 --> 12:09.600]  that's the political impact. The second case is that is this war winnable if they
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.600]  open a front towards Pakistan another three or four is it possible at a time
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.880]  when America stands exhausted their allies European allies they want to
[12:19.880 --> 12:25.320]  leave Afghanistan as quickly as possible the economic situation America is in
[12:25.320 --> 12:31.720]  shambles market forces are really not being able to pull themselves together
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.160]  so this is a situation I this hypothesis I rule out that they are prepared to
[12:37.160 --> 12:42.920]  because if they continue to push this way Pakistan and against the wall then
[12:42.920 --> 12:49.760]  Pakistan may well Alex I'm telling you may turn out to be China's Israel in the
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.200]  future and that is not going to be good for anybody I mean this is a a
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.520]  horrendous scenario which must be avoided the other thing is that then why
[13:02.520 --> 13:06.440]  have they done this because if it is ridiculous to come in for an attack at
[13:06.440 --> 13:12.040]  this time the second hypothesis and I think my leading hypothesis is that
[13:12.040 --> 13:17.680]  there is a special going on between the White House and the Pentagon and the New
[13:17.680 --> 13:26.400]  Combs and the lobbyists of Israel and India they are somehow they are fixed
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.880]  against the withdrawal and particularly quick withdrawal they want America to
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.960]  hang on pain blood and money and there is another element which is very
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.840]  interesting these are the security contractors hundred thousand and five
[13:40.840 --> 13:46.520]  thousand more I mean 105 thousand security contractors are now making hay in
[13:46.520 --> 13:50.720]  Afghanistan because there's so much money unaccounted for which goes into
[13:50.720 --> 13:58.840]  their pockets and who are these guys they are the FBI the ex former CIA and
[13:58.840 --> 14:05.080]  former military men so they are making a lot of money these old croonies of the
[14:05.080 --> 14:10.480]  serving generals are now really into their hand is in the tail and they are
[14:10.480 --> 14:17.200]  making immeasurably amount of money and there is another group and these are
[14:17.200 --> 14:23.280]  security contractors also they are in cohoots with the smuggler the drug
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.680]  traffickers and the last year the volume of opium produced in Afghanistan was
[14:29.680 --> 14:36.400]  6,500 ton which was down to 50 tons in the last year of Taliban rule in
[14:36.400 --> 14:43.880]  Afghanistan so these 6,500 tons of opium on the open market would fetch
[14:43.880 --> 14:47.720]  something like as a raw opium it will fetch something like five billion
[14:47.720 --> 14:54.640]  dollars now this is a huge amount of money but I am surprised that this there
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.040]  has been no haul because Pakistan has been traditionally the narcotic route
[14:59.040 --> 15:05.440]  towards Karachi and beyond but for the last six seven years there has been no
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.840]  big haul in Pakistan no catches in Pakistan so how is this so much of
[15:12.840 --> 15:20.080]  opium going across because this is 90% of world supply so general general let me
[15:20.080 --> 15:24.520]  stop you there because you obviously don't see a lot of US television but
[15:24.520 --> 15:31.920]  you can just type in US troops protect poppies or protect opium into YouTube
[15:31.920 --> 15:38.000]  or Google you will get BBC CBS ABC and they just show the reporters going in a
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.600]  new policy this is the last five years we help grow it we don't discuss where
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.560]  it's shipped it's freedom so they're publicly I'm not kidding I know it's
[15:47.560 --> 15:51.600]  crazy they ship it here and then when they catch people using it they throw
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.640]  them in prisons owned by the very banks that launder the drug money so it's a new
[15:55.640 --> 16:00.360]  level of drug dealing where they actually the drug dealers actually put you in
[16:00.360 --> 16:04.160]  their prisons but so obviously they want to stay there you know it's it's about
[16:04.160 --> 16:07.640]  the hundreds of billions of street value a year as you said 90% of opium
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.280]  production but but where is it going now that they've attacked this base now
[16:12.280 --> 16:17.800]  that the Russians are doing this where do you see the situation in
[16:17.800 --> 16:24.600]  Afghanistan going as resistance mounts as we go into the 11th year coming up
[16:24.600 --> 16:31.040]  yes now this is a very a very big precarious situation and I said to China
[16:31.040 --> 16:35.840]  has also come out strongly in favor of Pakistan and I described to you that
[16:35.840 --> 16:43.920]  China over time may become to Pakistan like America is to Israel so Pakistan
[16:43.920 --> 16:48.960]  will have no choice than to come under the umbrella of China and China obviously
[16:48.960 --> 16:53.040]  is not disinterested with the amount of money they have and they're flexing their
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.920]  muscles there and there and this would keep India on the wrong side of history
[16:58.920 --> 17:02.760]  because India is being backed by America and America is losing the war they are
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.720]  losing their image and they are being threatened from now all directions I
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.840]  think the look at the timings in which they have attacked Pakistani post it
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.920]  means they have hurt themselves more than anyone can hurt them but at a time
[17:15.920 --> 17:21.280]  when ten thousand troops were to be withdrawn by 31st of December so what
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.880]  happens to that because there was an attempt to find a safe saving formula
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.040]  by going to the bone earlier on there was a stumble and what happened to a
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.080]  stumble it was a fiasco and now it was born and born is no go without
[17:37.080 --> 17:42.120]  Pakistan participation so the net result is that you have lost so much
[17:42.120 --> 17:47.560]  diplomatically politically already economic loss is very much staring you
[17:47.560 --> 17:52.680]  in the eyes and now you have strategically beginning to lose so this is a
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.320]  very difficult situation for America today I think if they don't set their
[17:57.320 --> 18:01.960]  bearings right it is going to hurt them a lot more than it appears at the moment
[18:01.960 --> 18:07.040]  but let me stop you general because look I mean I know you're sophisticated and
[18:07.040 --> 18:11.840]  the Pakistani people are sophisticated but we have been seized by the big six
[18:11.840 --> 18:16.060]  megabanks they are imploding Europe and bragging that Goldman Sachs the main
[18:16.060 --> 18:19.840]  Federal Reserve owner has conquered Europe through fraud that's in our news
[18:19.840 --> 18:25.200]  they are militarizing the police they are setting up checkpoints in America they
[18:25.200 --> 18:29.960]  are saying they can arrest us torture us publicly now I mean this is some of the
[18:29.960 --> 18:35.880]  most brazen tyranny ever seen being publicly announced like it's no big
[18:35.880 --> 18:41.080]  deal so clearly the folks in Pakistan need to know America has been seized by
[18:41.080 --> 18:45.520]  a global criminal interest that wants to destroy America's name that wants to
[18:45.520 --> 18:52.000]  destroy Pakistan and and I I don't know how worldwide we fight such a threat that
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.240]  works through hijacked nations playing them off against each other yeah
[18:58.240 --> 19:04.600]  element to the dark element in American society which is deep deep into and
[19:04.600 --> 19:09.040]  they have gotten control and clout over all the policy-making is somehow and
[19:09.040 --> 19:14.960]  also strong you may have to fight for your freedom and fresh so it is it is
[19:14.960 --> 19:20.480]  amazing that such a lot of things are happening and the American people are
[19:20.480 --> 19:24.960]  still not there is no movement like moratorium they back in the days of
[19:24.960 --> 19:29.320]  President Nixon there has to be a movement the people of America have to
[19:29.320 --> 19:34.200]  rise against their own policies against these coercive elements which are
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.600]  trying to destroy the American dream they are trying to destroy everything
[19:38.600 --> 19:43.840]  they are trying to somehow rail against their own best friends in the world
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.680]  Pakistan has been their best friend Pakistan has paid such a huge price
[19:47.680 --> 19:52.280]  and Pakistan has done so much for America people seem to have forgotten that
[19:52.280 --> 19:59.080]  and this is a situation in which America seems to be a self-destruct but it is
[19:59.080 --> 20:03.080]  not because of the American people who are very innocent and very nice very
[20:03.080 --> 20:09.560]  humane very nice people to begin with I think they respect democracy they
[20:09.560 --> 20:13.640]  respect the human rights of other people as much as they respect their own
[20:13.640 --> 20:20.040]  rights and then who is doing all this we generally know what who is there but
[20:20.040 --> 20:28.800]  this the confederation of I would say tugs and sprinklers cheats this is now
[20:28.800 --> 20:33.040]  getting the upper hand unfortunately and they are as you very rightly said they
[20:33.040 --> 20:37.320]  are destroying America and they're destroying the world well yes sir the
[20:37.320 --> 20:41.480]  main financial advisor to Obama is Corson the former governor in New Jersey the
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.600]  former head of Goldman Sachs he made a 40-to-1 bet with MF global money just to
[20:46.600 --> 20:50.720]  show the reckless psychology of these people and when it didn't go well the
[20:50.720 --> 20:55.880]  government allowed him to take private bank accounts and brokerage accounts of
[20:55.880 --> 21:01.160]  people in sub companies that MF global had bought and I've had financial experts
[21:01.160 --> 21:05.360]  on the news admits it's illegal but the government's gonna let them do this I
[21:05.360 --> 21:09.880]  mean that's what's scary is that when you realize these swindlers and bank
[21:09.880 --> 21:14.960]  fraud people that that run everything they don't know military tactics they're
[21:14.960 --> 21:19.960]  they're losing touch and it's been multiple US generals Admiral Fox Fallon
[21:19.960 --> 21:24.600]  and others who refused to attack Iran who refused to attack the only reason we
[21:24.600 --> 21:28.600]  didn't do this earlier I mean that's what I'm saying is these people are
[21:28.600 --> 21:34.440]  insane and I don't know how we get rid of them minus another George Washington
[21:34.440 --> 21:42.120]  1776 yes absolutely but look at the character of the general at this time
[21:42.120 --> 21:47.040]  who are in office in charge at this moment in Afghanistan if they play along
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.000]  with these elements as I described the dark elements the sinister elements
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.920]  within the American policymaking body then I think they are not being loyal to
[21:58.920 --> 22:02.640]  their own country they are not doing their duty because you have to always
[22:02.640 --> 22:06.920]  convey the cause and effect what is the cause and what is going to be the effect
[22:06.920 --> 22:12.560]  and on that scale they are net losers America is a net loser so why are they
[22:12.560 --> 22:17.880]  doing things which which will eventually put America in a hole this is a very
[22:17.880 --> 22:21.840]  peculiar situation which has to be handled and which has to be addressed by
[22:21.840 --> 22:26.600]  the people of America nobody else can taste eyes them other than the American
[22:26.600 --> 22:30.480]  American people themselves general homemade goals our guests for another ten
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.280]  minutes and we appreciate him giving us a time here today very busy person I mean
[22:35.280 --> 22:38.880]  really when you study psychology you study history as a general as a former
[22:38.880 --> 22:43.360]  head of a famous intelligence agency who was very successful defeating the KGB
[22:43.360 --> 22:49.320]  in KVD the Russian military all of them you have to know the enemy so looking at
[22:49.320 --> 22:53.320]  your enemy the global mega banks my enemy the global mega banks this global
[22:53.320 --> 22:58.000]  corporate globalism they do want to destroy America while using us to carry
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  out the next phase of their operation they've moved our industry to China so
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.640]  it is part of a larger double-cross they're gonna implode America just like
[23:05.640 --> 23:10.640]  Europe next but they want a war in the middle of that knowing the enemy and
[23:10.640 --> 23:15.040]  that's the key as you noted to winning a war and having supply lines you know
[23:15.040 --> 23:21.480]  those two paramount peaks together those twin peaks what concerns me general is
[23:21.480 --> 23:27.360]  now I see delusion in the elite there's still a strategy and I see the gambits
[23:27.360 --> 23:32.360]  but it doesn't make sense in the end even if command destruction order out of
[23:32.360 --> 23:38.120]  chaos is their overall excuse it isn't gonna work I mean the Russians now are
[23:38.120 --> 23:42.160]  threatening to start attacking countries and and the history shows the
[23:42.160 --> 23:48.840]  Russians will do things like that I mean this is so dangerous getting into the
[23:48.840 --> 23:52.760]  minds of these people when I know you've tried to do that probably what do you
[23:52.760 --> 23:56.440]  think's driving them right now what's driving Israel what's driving the big
[23:56.440 --> 24:01.760]  banks what's what's driving England greed and fear
[24:01.760 --> 24:07.660]  greed and fear there is a fear in Israel there's fear in India that if the
[24:07.660 --> 24:12.360]  Americans leave and Americans they will be extending absolute departure on the
[24:12.360 --> 24:16.880]  wrong side of history and as far as the banks are concerned and corrupt
[24:16.880 --> 24:23.720]  corporate America corrupt corporate Europe the corporate world is despicable
[24:23.720 --> 24:29.840]  now this really it is 10 to months to put virtually it if you translate it
[24:29.840 --> 24:36.040]  its spirit that means corruption so they are so corrupt that now you can't
[24:36.040 --> 24:40.200]  retrieve them you've got to demolish them because you have to survive the
[24:40.200 --> 24:43.840]  nations have to survive America has to survive it is important that America
[24:43.840 --> 24:49.280]  survive then these elements have to be cut out yeah there have to be surgical
[24:49.280 --> 24:54.680]  operation against them well there's certainly waging war against free
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.080]  humanity and every basic liberty and then overthrowing the entire Bill of
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.080]  Rights and Constitution right now but but I guess in the final equation general
[25:03.080 --> 25:07.400]  the good news is everything that the that they're touching is turning to
[25:07.400 --> 25:15.200]  garbage yes indeed it is it is because this act of four days ago when they
[25:15.200 --> 25:22.160]  struck our security post on the border I think this has really turned the scale
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.480]  against them and now they can't now it has to be reckoned with you have to be
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.880]  now it you have come to a point where it's a tilt point and you've got to
[25:33.880 --> 25:38.520]  change your ways and you've got not to listen to those people who have been
[25:38.520 --> 25:43.640]  putting America in the rank wrong track of the wrong policy now could there be
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.800]  another strategy I mean it looks like a bungalow but but could the strategy be
[25:47.800 --> 25:52.840]  try to create political discord to destabilize the government of Pakistan
[25:52.840 --> 25:58.480]  as a desperate fleeing forward to start a new war with Pakistan I mean could
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.600]  that could this be conscious because they've done this three or four times
[26:02.600 --> 26:08.160]  now in the last year killing Pakistani troops correct my dear Eric if this was
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.960]  the design then I think it has failed miserably because it has put the American
[26:13.960 --> 26:19.440]  Pakistani government and Pakistan armed forces and the same page if there was
[26:19.440 --> 26:26.640]  any daylight on account of this famous memo that was written by Hussain Akhani
[26:26.640 --> 26:32.040]  our ambassador in America there was a daylight between the armed forces
[26:32.040 --> 26:36.960]  establishment and the political government but that has gone now with
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.440]  this one act the Americans have really brought the whole nation alerted them
[26:41.440 --> 26:45.720]  everybody's out on the streets people are shouting against America there was
[26:45.720 --> 26:50.920]  already no love lost for American policies but now I think it is really
[26:50.920 --> 26:56.520]  crossed all limits in closing what's your view on an Iran strike Israel's
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.840]  moving their Jericho missiles into firing position my intel from people in
[27:00.840 --> 27:08.080]  US intelligence is currently the green lights on what's your take on that no
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.960]  no they will never do that they can't defeat Iran they have 278 sites which
[27:12.960 --> 27:18.960]  it will have to be taken out that is impossible then 60% of oil supplies of
[27:18.960 --> 27:25.080]  the world can be cut off in a couple of days by Iran no way that they can win
[27:25.080 --> 27:30.040]  this it will be a sheer madness and America must take clear of this if I
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.760]  want to do it leave them tell them give them the warning if you do it go it
[27:34.760 --> 27:39.440]  alone then we will not be with you it's your business you want to do it and they
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.840]  were rubbed so badly in south of Lebanon in 2006 how dare they do it if the
[27:45.840 --> 27:50.520]  Americans don't give go ahead to them well yes that's what a mullin when he
[27:50.520 --> 27:53.960]  left told them don't do it it's crazy Panetta's told him it's crazy the
[27:53.960 --> 27:57.080]  former head of Mossad they were moving because he said it was crazy just a
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.880]  year ago and that's what I'm being told everyone's telling him it's crazy it's
[28:01.880 --> 28:09.640]  gonna unify all the Arabs all the all of the Persians all of the central Asians
[28:09.640 --> 28:14.480]  don't do it but Netanyahu thinks he's gonna be like Churchill and that it's
[28:14.480 --> 28:19.400]  gonna make America come to his aid I think he should be summoned to America
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.360]  and put through a psychiatric test I think this man is psycho he has got to
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.760]  be reined in but for the love of this world for the love of freedom for the
[28:28.760 --> 28:34.320]  love of people of America and the rest of the world well we've everybody even in
[28:34.320 --> 28:40.480]  the establishment is smart enough to tell them not to do this I sure well we
[28:40.480 --> 28:43.760]  do know there's covert bombings going on against the facilities right now in
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.120]  Iran that's now basically being admitted what's your view on Iran just
[28:48.120 --> 28:55.640]  taking this no Iran is showing restraint and I think it's just as well but I was
[28:55.640 --> 29:03.800]  in Iran only a month month back and I found that nation is unperturbed about
[29:03.800 --> 29:08.720]  all the threats which are being dished out to them they are united and whatever
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.760]  there was a little fissure politically in the society that immediately has
[29:14.760 --> 29:19.880]  disappeared after the threat from Israel and they have close their ranks now
[29:19.880 --> 29:25.920]  they're even more united than before so really I don't know I don't think Israel
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.360]  will do that I hope not I hope not I really for the sake of humanity and for
[29:31.360 --> 29:35.600]  the future of mankind I hope this never happens all right general Hamed Ghul

[34:03.120 --> 34:08.640]  thank you so much for joining us today we've got man Cal Muller Eric man Cal
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.280]  Muller syndicated radio host joining us the first 20 minutes to the next hour
[34:13.280 --> 34:17.520]  then Lyndon LaRouche is joining us and then we'll have open phones for large
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.680]  portions of the third hour today in fact probably even try to take some calls
[34:22.680 --> 34:26.760]  while Lyndon LaRouche is on with us if you have any economic questions again I
[34:26.760 --> 34:31.480]  don't endorse some of LaRouche's solutions but his analysis of who runs the
[34:31.480 --> 34:35.680]  world the eugenics population control program they were one of the first
[34:35.680 --> 34:41.560]  groups 30 years ago to accurately track exactly what was going on and I'd read
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.680]  their stuff 16 17 years ago and go oh this isn't true and I separately doing
[34:46.680 --> 34:52.720]  my own original research found that they were telling the truth and it's again
[34:52.720 --> 34:55.880]  some people go to Disney World and say I discovered Disney World you know you
[34:55.880 --> 34:59.320]  discover it for yourself I'm not even saying I found original stuff I'm saying
[34:59.320 --> 35:04.240]  I went out separately and kept running in to this information they've got it
[35:04.240 --> 35:12.360]  dead bang on dead bang on and of course LaRouche was also advisor to Ronald
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.120]  Reagan of all people and was a the CIA director called him the best private
[35:16.120 --> 35:20.080]  intelligence analyst and all the stuff in the Washington Post and boy the
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.240]  government George Herbert Walker Bush got jealous and they threw his butt in

[36:08.760 --> 36:12.280]  last year they've they've moved us down in the rankings even though we're
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.040]  number one they're doing everything they can but but now there's government
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.720]  announcements that they're ordering that hold databases of terms they give
[36:21.720 --> 36:27.360]  Google be delisted and this is kind of an all-a-cart internet kill switch I've
[36:27.360 --> 36:31.800]  got that in the news I'm gonna raise with man cow and some other issues coming
[36:31.800 --> 36:36.840]  up in the next hour but but just huge developments that are taking place right
[36:36.840 --> 36:42.760]  now that's why more than ever you've got to get the URL of info wars.com and
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.360]  prison planet.com out to everybody you can spray paint it on the side of your
[36:47.360 --> 36:51.400]  business spray paint it on your billboard or the side of your barn if

[36:56.520 --> 37:00.080]  cuss words you don't want to censor the cuss words that's wrong I'm not saying
[37:00.080 --> 37:04.320]  if there's some globalist homeland security billboard to climb upon it and
[37:04.320 --> 37:08.960]  spray paint info wars.com we should let them have a trader's Senate who says
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.320]  they're allowed to insider trade and be public criminals past laws saying
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.520]  citizens can be arrested held forever tortured killed whatever that that's
[37:16.520 --> 37:21.680]  George Washington would love that we you know we shouldn't we shouldn't do
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.680]  anything to try to resist this okay I'm being sarcastic now the point is is that
[37:26.680 --> 37:31.280]  they're slowly accelerating their program and now they're getting pretty much to a
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.600]  jog now of censorship and control blotting out thousands of domains a
[37:35.600 --> 37:46.960]  month it is on so that's coming up huge financial news as well in fact it's now
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.880]  in the news Bloomberg Fed lowers interest rate on dollar swaps and if you
[37:51.880 --> 37:56.680]  look at this it's basically just more free taxpayer money to the European
[37:56.680 --> 38:01.240]  Central Bank which is really the same shareholders of the Federal Reserve so
[38:01.240 --> 38:05.480]  it's just one hand giving it to the other hand but the hands are attacked or
[38:05.480 --> 38:11.800]  attached to the same system Fed lowers interest rate on dollar swaps six
[38:11.800 --> 38:15.120]  central banks led by the Federal Reserve lowered the cost of emergency dollar
[38:15.120 --> 38:19.440]  funding for financial companies in a global effort to ease Europe's sovereign
[38:19.440 --> 38:23.440]  debt crisis and that sent the markets up then a week from now they'll be back
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.800]  down they'll be give us another giant bailout and the markets will go up and
[38:27.800 --> 38:32.400]  then oh they went down a new crisis as they take over every country and say
[38:32.400 --> 38:39.480]  we'll fix your economy for a few weeks if you just give us total sovereignty and
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.880]  promise to raise all your taxes to pay to the private banks who actually
[38:43.880 --> 38:49.240]  engineered the fraud I mean it's that brazen it's that naked here's some of the
[38:49.240 --> 38:54.000]  other headlines bank downgrade rampage Goldman Bank of America Morgan Stanley

[39:13.840 --> 39:18.920]  to go bankrupt it is beginning and it'll all be imploded into this new global
[39:18.920 --> 39:24.120]  mega bank that issues global bonds first a Europe bond then a global bond and
[39:24.120 --> 39:28.280]  they'll say if you're tired of the depression give your sovereignty over to
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.680]  the banks and we're like but wait those are the same bankers that engineered
[39:32.680 --> 39:39.000]  this D list their website shut them down you know we just got new government
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.960]  documents yesterday which the government admits they list mainline libertarian

[40:21.480 --> 40:25.080]  federal agents you know we've got all these federal memos that have been
[40:25.080 --> 40:28.320]  leaked and lawsuits that have gotten the four-year request that show the
[40:28.320 --> 40:32.360]  government was involved and the FBI head of counterterrorism was there that day
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.760]  lied about it publicly to Congress we want an investigation and you know what
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.720]  Homeland Security has enlisted as domestic terrorist effect I want to get
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.640]  state rep Charles Key on about this it says they are terrorist that actually
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.520]  says under domestic terrorism Homeland Security and they actually give this to
[40:49.520 --> 40:54.520]  every police department oh officers if they investigate the government blowing
[40:54.520 --> 41:00.960]  this up their terrorist I mean we have criminals in the government bought and
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.360]  paid for by the mega banks they're trying to fully convert us over to a
[41:04.360 --> 41:09.520]  tyranny and the tunnel only gets deeper and darker if they understand there's
[41:09.520 --> 41:13.840]  no America there's no nothing they want to destroy the free market they want you
[41:13.840 --> 41:21.160]  poor they want to end the American dream and cowardly going along with this is
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.160]  only going to empower the system do we have that RT clip from yesterday ready
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.960]  we do good on the nightly news last night I played this clip and I played
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.760]  other senators admitting that yes it's for US citizens including John McCain
[41:36.760 --> 41:40.120]  and I want to get to that in a few minutes and then and then do is
[41:40.120 --> 41:43.320]  converting the clips from last night show I forgot to tell him so I can play
[41:43.320 --> 41:47.280]  him here he's transferring them off that computer system over to this system I
[41:47.280 --> 41:50.320]  don't know the files they have over there don't play over here so we're
[41:50.320 --> 41:54.480]  waiting on those so that can play you the eclipse we put together for the
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.680]  nightly news last night of all these senators going yes this legislation does
[41:59.680 --> 42:05.240]  allow the secret arrest and permanent detention of Americans with no judge no
[42:05.240 --> 42:10.000]  jury no nothing the army will rule America just absolute total tyranny
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.240]  just 100% secret arrest you disappear and they've said in other rulings we can
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.840]  kill you we can torture you just absolute Joseph Mingle a level off the
[42:19.840 --> 42:28.520]  charts is just North Korea North Korea and they'll try to they'll slowly
[42:28.520 --> 42:33.320]  implement it of course it'll be a bad man it'll be a child molester it'll it'll
[42:33.320 --> 42:38.520]  be an al-Qaeda to say well you know they don't deserve any due process so that
[42:38.520 --> 42:44.720]  you never find out what really happened I mean just total 110% bondage it says
[42:44.720 --> 42:51.360]  if you're suspected by any branch of the military you're going and I have Rand
[42:51.360 --> 42:54.680]  Paul talking about it I have McCain admitting it I have Lindsey Graham
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.080]  admitting it I have all the clips and still oh by the way the bill passed the
[42:59.080 --> 43:03.400]  Senate and it's gonna go into conference but the house passed the similar
[43:03.400 --> 43:08.160]  bill so now it's gonna go to Obama's desk he says he's gonna veto which I've
[43:08.160 --> 43:11.880]  got to say is good but remember when they tried to give him this power last
[43:11.880 --> 43:15.440]  year he said well I can still have secret arrest and kill American citizens
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.040]  abroad or domestically I don't need Congress to pass this law they tried to
[43:19.040 --> 43:25.000]  pass it last year so last year I haven't seen Obama's threatened veto statement
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.200]  it's not public yet he just said we'll have a veto but I did see it last year
[43:29.200 --> 43:34.040]  and it was I already have this authority I don't need you to give it to me so the
[43:34.040 --> 43:39.440]  lawyers are like don't even have it under law that implies that this tyrannical
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.200]  act could be repealed at some time execute it through the executive just
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.160]  as you have done with the new wars you have launched don't call it war throw
[43:48.160 --> 43:52.360]  that in the slaves face destroy the meaning of logic and language
[43:52.360 --> 43:56.760]  fire of course he's actually just a minion came out Rahm Emanuel cracks his
[43:56.760 --> 44:01.680]  knuckles in meetings bosses Obama around verbally slaps him around and of
[44:01.680 --> 44:07.040]  course Emanuel himself is a puppet but that's basically the view we will begin
[44:07.040 --> 44:11.320]  Robo signing even though it's been ruled to be illegal in your bills throw it
[44:11.320 --> 44:15.160]  in their face no president has ever served as the head of the UN Security
[44:15.160 --> 44:20.080]  Council in its 60 year history plus but you will serve as the head of the
[44:20.080 --> 44:26.320]  rotating post that's why they had the Rockefellers and they had Kissinger and
[44:26.320 --> 44:31.520]  Brzezinski and I showed the clips it's in fall the Republic but they are there
[44:31.520 --> 44:35.360]  at the UN in New York and they're shaking they're laughing some of them
[44:35.360 --> 44:38.480]  have tears in their eyes they're going oh and actually settle the news this is
[44:38.480 --> 44:43.360]  quite a moment for them I seeing the president over the UN while he's
[44:43.360 --> 44:49.280]  president it's against article 9 section I forget actually on the back of fall
[44:49.280 --> 44:55.040]  the Republic alone I know a lot about the Constitution but sometimes I article
[44:55.040 --> 44:58.680]  one section 9 of the US Constitution by cheating himself at the head of the
[44:58.680 --> 45:02.360]  United Nations Security Council again he's brazenly violated article one
[45:02.360 --> 45:10.960]  section 9 the first president to chair the Council and I mean they had tears
[45:10.960 --> 45:17.480]  in their eyes the level of squatting on us and spitting in our face and dragging
[45:17.480 --> 45:24.040]  us through the mud and and now they've introduced new legislation to openly say
[45:24.040 --> 45:31.400]  unlimited torture for false confessions terror fear they already have had
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.480]  federal and state courts rule police can taser you to make you answer questions
[45:35.480 --> 45:38.600]  I thought there was a fifth amendment no you can actually type into the search
[45:38.600 --> 45:41.600]  engine I've seen this in the last six years in Florida New York and other
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.960]  states they've had federal and state judges rule oh the gentlemen would not
[45:45.960 --> 45:51.640]  answer questions while at the hospital so he was restrained and tasered 19 times
[45:51.640 --> 45:56.680]  until answering of course that was because of a lawsuit the guy had a heart
[45:56.680 --> 46:02.840]  palpitations and a mild heart attack and the judge said we can kill you and the
[46:02.840 --> 46:07.440]  media is saying hey let ESPN cover up child rape for 10 years that's come out

[49:14.400 --> 49:21.600]  even Bobby Steiner but the point is that this is 10 times world bull riding
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.280]  champion here I mean this is it people are like well what's the big deal of the
[49:26.280 --> 49:28.680]  birds are still gonna be tweeting tomorrow yeah they're gonna slowly
[49:28.680 --> 49:32.880]  implement it and then if they're able to get their plan fully and they're gonna
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.080]  unload this stuff first they're gonna start shutting down the web they're
[49:36.080 --> 49:39.560]  gonna start censoring talk radio they'll use case point examples to sell it
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.360]  let's go to this little clip of senator Lindsey Graham saying yeah it's for US
[49:44.360 --> 49:48.000]  citizens here's the clip
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.800]  exactly simple language here so why don't I play something for you from one of
[49:52.800 --> 49:55.880]  the bills backers senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina this is what he
[49:55.880 --> 50:02.160]  said on the Senate floor a few weeks ago 1032 the military custody provision
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.920]  which has waivers and a lot of flexibility doesn't apply to American
[50:05.920 --> 50:11.440]  citizens 1031 the statement of authority detain does apply to American
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.160]  citizens and it designates the world as the battlefield including the homeland
[50:16.160 --> 50:21.280]  the battlefield says senator Graham is right here in your front yard right
[50:21.280 --> 50:25.280]  there and he says Americans and I've got McCain admitting it and others
[50:25.280 --> 50:28.680]  admitting and it's in the language it says you don't you know you're exempt
[50:28.680 --> 50:32.400]  from this unless we say so and then you've got the previous enemy
[50:32.400 --> 50:37.040]  commissions military commissions act all this stuff it says it's not for
[50:37.040 --> 50:40.240]  citizens but we strip you of the citizenship actually traditionally and
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.440]  then it's secret I mean that they already are killing American citizens
[50:44.440 --> 50:47.840]  abroad now they're saying they're gonna kill us domestically
[50:47.840 --> 50:53.120]  Israelis told Reuters five years ago they said we'll kill US citizens in
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.680]  America and the US government said go ahead I mean come on wake up don't live
[50:57.680 --> 51:03.520]  in denial the right back we all know that Berkey water purification systems

[54:28.000 --> 54:32.400]  McCann and others admit it's for us citizens but notice this was always
[54:32.400 --> 54:35.360]  there but when they wanted to get it passed and they didn't want opposition
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.080]  amount they came out last week and said it wasn't in there some of the
[54:39.080 --> 54:42.800]  Republican and Democratic leadership and they had operatives online and a
[54:42.800 --> 54:48.320]  disinformation campaign most of them paid bloggers and Pentagon people and
[54:48.320 --> 54:52.800]  they've got a script they go follow it they say this isn't true just to make
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.480]  the debate about whether it's true or not show that people don't then have a
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.440]  debate about do we want to be secretly arrested and disappear forever and be
[55:00.440 --> 55:04.200]  tortured now they're going ahead with torture and of course they denied
[55:04.200 --> 55:07.680]  torture at first then it came out the White House ordered it so they went ahead
[55:07.680 --> 55:15.760]  and burned some of their own minions in all of this and now the Senate's
[55:15.760 --> 55:21.120]  considering bill authorizing more torture and the law enforcement magazines

[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:56.440]  mass it starts going straight up and that's basically what's happening fresh
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.840]  on the heels of passing in the Senate in definite detention no judge no jury by
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.640]  the military the in-deposit commentatus operating on the streets of America

[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.080]  in Austin Texas are you are you an oddball when you walk around Austin no
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.560]  that's the media creating a false paradigm that it's a bunch of commies
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.520]  running around with limp wrists that's very small sectors for at least 20 years
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.480]  there's no real voting in Austin Austin's very libertarian very conservative
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.360]  but we don't have voting here I even had the state admit that in a certified
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.480]  deal this at the county commissioners years ago well well do you love how this
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.520]  cherry-mandering works so much so that now they've redrawn the lines and and a
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.360]  guy like Barney Frank can't get in Barney Frank who who's responsible for
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.120]  much of the housing bubble crisis and and his friend Newt Gingrich helps I
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.880]  mean no matter how we vote it seems left or right we get more of them and by them

[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.920]  matter left or right they all need this not to be torture because they all
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.680]  signed off on it and look there is an Islamic red you and I agree on this but
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.760]  I wonder how much of it they let happen and it always goes back to the basic

[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:16.480]  Mandkelmullerofmandkel.com joins us I wanted to get his take on the
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:21.160]  Republican field on what's happening in the global economy on problem reaction
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.840]  solution on the feds now ordering delisting of websites on Google no
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.080]  judge no jury it's getting crazy the internet kill switch all a cart but
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.160]  first Mandkel fast and furious we learned that the government shipped the
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.640]  guns directly into Mexico and into Indiana Illinois Florida to drug gangs
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.400]  they like to knock out other drug gangs they ship drugs in it's been confirmed
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.480]  that they lied to Congress and now it's just gone off the radar screen there's
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.440]  a great example of problem reaction solution or a false flag terror attack
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.880]  if shipping tens of thousands of guns in that killed thousands of Mexicans
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.960]  hundreds of Americans at least three police officers and Border Patrol if
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.000]  that's not a false flag terror attack I mean if they'll do that why wouldn't they
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.640]  do Oklahoma City this same Attorney General was the deputy Attorney General
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:18.760]  with his hands deep in Oklahoma City 16 17 years ago Alex I'm gonna go crazy
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.080]  dear I'm gonna I'm gonna go way off course and I'm gonna bring it home okay
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.160]  but stick with me I interviewed a doctor today I spoke with a doctor and he's
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.440]  gonna be on this weed wars TV show it debuts tomorrow night on Discovery I
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.760]  don't care whether anyone watches it or not and he did studies on marijuana and
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.480]  basically whether you're pro weed or not why we have this war on TV you know
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.320]  this war on everything the drug wars cost us a lot of money I mean I had a
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.160]  kid a 17 year old kid in front of my house he got pulled over they found a
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.600]  seed the government took his car he said hey man I it's a used car they found a
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:02.400]  seed a single marijuana seed and they sold his car our government loves finding
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.800]  some kid with a little bit of weed half a joint a roach or something so they can
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:11.320]  take your property and sell it and then and then get the money okay this is all
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.720]  this is all okay so they went and did the study they wanted to prove this
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.800]  doctor that I spoke with wanted to prove the evils of marijuana he was anti
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.560]  marijuana and he couldn't do it okay I'm not pro weed I'm not anti weed I'm
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.640]  just saying it's a freedom issue now every time they try to do an anti gun
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:36.400]  study if they're intellectually honest they they cannot prove that more guns
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.960]  equals more crime or anything about Illinois professor got caught lying to
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.920]  give the only anti gun study ever and it turned out it was fake and he lost his
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:51.360]  tenure the fact is that more guns equal less crime did you hear that folks that
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.560]  stepper than everything you've ever heard more guns equals less crime why look
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.120]  I'm in the city of Chicago you ought to see these guys I go to work at 2 30 in
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.520]  the morning their asses hanging out the back of their pants they're looking for
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.160]  victims if they think you can shoot back they're not gonna they're not gonna
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.320]  burglarize your rent here or kill you we need guns to look at the most liberal
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.400]  cities with the most kind of you're that old man in Chicago I see all these
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.480]  videos where they beat up old people blood blood everywhere and the cops do
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.520]  nothing about it well apparently when when when white people are being up in
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:29.200]  Chicago because they're white and I think every crime is a crime you know
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.080]  every crime is a crime but but you know if you're if you're whiting in Chicago
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.960]  that isn't a crime anyway I look at the point I'm making is Alex you and I
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:44.800]  disagree I believe fast and furious was so good look what do we cling to in
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.640]  America what is Obama oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and Eric
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.400]  Holder they hate God guns and cuts right they hate God guns and guns yes what
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.080]  America's made we're made of God guns and cuts and you people in Texas and the
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.320]  border states you people cling to your God your guns and you've got guts and
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.840]  they hate it so they wanted to get these guns into the Mexican gangbangers so
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.240]  they would slaughter men women and children they wanted the dead kids to
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.320]  be on TV so that they could pass more laws to take the good people's guns
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.700]  that's what this was about don't you see that Alex no I don't I think in New
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.920]  York with the highest crime rate next to Chicago with a total gun ban for
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.960]  citizens is reasonable and I think you know it's no mistake that cities run by
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:38.960]  Mafia's what want the public disarmed I think North Korea is a great place where
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:46.120]  they ban guns and I'm being serious you're like don't you get it Alex so I
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.680]  thought I'd be sarcastic back let's shift gears into Newt Gennrich Newt
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.160]  Gennrich supported NAFTA GATT the banker bailout carbon taxes he wrote
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:00.040]  creepy forwards to Toffler's book where he calls for global government into the
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:06.000]  family you've got Mitt Romney just as creepy pro abortion anti-gun amnesty
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.880]  city wrote Obamacare and I forget some in there's so much and then now these
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.880]  two are dueling with each other in fact we got a document cam shot in here
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:22.320]  here's Gallup poll Gennrich leads Romney at new low at a new low and positive
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:28.920]  survey and it now shows Gennrich way above Mitt Romney Mitt Romney's down at
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.560]  nine Gennrich down at 20 I mean what is wrong with Republicans that are being
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.240]  polled or are these polls real how could they support these guys who basically
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.360]  say I'm conservative but I support everything Al Gore does and you know
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.720]  then you have Huntsman who worked for Obama I mean come on it's these guys
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:55.120]  are plans look new Gingrich I like to do okay I knew it's a friend of mine he's
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.240]  a smart guy but certainly what you're talking about I'm not being I'm not
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.720]  being safe here but it is very troubling Mitt Romney boy he's all over the place
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.680]  look I've had dinner with Mitt several times he's a nice enough guy but you know
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:13.080]  he's the guy that has tassels on his shoes any man that's ever worked for
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:19.840]  a living any man that has ever worked for a living knows Mitt Romney let me let
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.120]  me tell you who he is okay he's the guy that wears the Disney tie and thinks
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.960]  he's wacky he's the guy that forces everybody to go bowling so that they
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:32.120]  can bond he asked you know that yeah tassels on his shoes that makes them
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.960]  wacky he points his finger at you he winks at you he's cool but really he's
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.840]  just a stroke he's just another one of those guys that doesn't that's Nick he
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.240]  wants to be like he wants to be cool and he just isn't and it seems to me he
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.680]  will say or do anything to get into the White House it makes me nervous now
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.800]  listen I've been in top networks I've been in newspapers and I've been in the
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:03.240]  top conservative radio show studios Alex I told you about this and I'm talking
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.640]  to most powerful people in media and it happened to be by chance on several
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:13.840]  occasions where Ron Paul wins their straw polls they do a national phone
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.280]  poll Ron Paul wins and they immediately throw it out they have a Ron Paul
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.320]  voters call a lot their cookie so they always eliminate Ron Paul I think Ron
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.480]  Paul has a much bigger following why do they keep giving us Mitt Romney the
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.600]  media wants Mitt Romney that makes me nervous because no matter how we vote
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.720]  we get more Obama we get more big government we get McCain we get Bob
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:41.280]  Dole we get we get more more more more of them in our life more taxes more
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.440]  intrusions and I had America sick of it I agree with you now listen a lot of
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.440]  people say this can't happen here but now now they're coming out saying let's
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.720]  censor the internet let's censor people we want let's censor talk radio let's
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.120]  have the government order Google to D list sites and let's have TSA on the
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.040]  streets and now they've passed the bill now they've got to implement and of
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.360]  course they'll they'll pick examples of really bad sounding people so it
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:13.280]  sounds reasonable to secretly arrest citizens Lindsey Graham has admitted it
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.480]  I've got clips of McCain admitting it it's in the bill they got it passed now
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.840]  Obama says he's gonna veto it but point is he's already still carrying out
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.000]  things like this now expanding on this now they're saying they're gonna go ahead
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.160]  and start torturing Americans regardless I mean again this stuff is so
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:37.240]  scary how why do you think all this is moving so quick right now man Joe look
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:42.760]  fear is the four-letter effort that controls the masses it's your wife your
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.040]  wife you divorce me I'll take everything and you won't see your kids it's the

[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.440]  shut up or I'm gonna spank you they use fear against us look at the movies look
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:03.840]  at the video games our society is based on fear look at the Islamic bogeyman
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.520]  why are we still letting these people into our country if they're so dangerous
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.680]  why are we allowing these people into our country do you see them walk through
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.400]  the line and yet my wife Alex who you know is very hot they always have to do
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.160]  the two-finger swipe on her they have to take pictures of our of our children

[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.240]  talked about this I've talked about it Ron Paul's talked about it I think that's
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:55.600]  our real ace in the hole is that we warn people this stuff's now happening and
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.000]  I mean something's got to give how can MF global and Corzine Obama's chief

[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.080]  activist and founder of a network of political committees parties and
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.640]  publications known collectively as a LaRouche movement and he was a perennial
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:37.080]  presidential candidate from 76 2004 running once for his own US Labor Party
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.840]  and campaigning seven times the Democratic Party LaRouche pack dot com
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.880]  he's been called a right winger by the left a left winger by the right his work
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.840]  of course has been called by former heads the National Security Council and
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.840]  others is quote the best private intelligence don't work out there I
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.320]  don't say I agree with all of their solutions perhaps because I don't grasp
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.920]  at all but I know their historical analysis is spot-on this is a short
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.520]  segment long segments coming up he's gonna be breaking it all down but I've
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.280]  got to say the things LaRouche talked about over a decade ago are now
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.240]  happening the global meltdown the derivatives crisis what's happening with
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.840]  the euro the total collapse the super committee and now they've passed the
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.000]  bill to allow the secret total arrest of American citizens disappearing for
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.800]  life for no reason in the dungeons they're now trying to pass a bill for
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.200]  total torture this is mainstream news and and again it's one thing to pass
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.320]  another thing to implement it it just shows the brazen criminality now of
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.320]  Congress and that they know everything's gonna collapse and the crooks don't want
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:43.680]  to get in trouble for their crimes they want to ride this tiger the question is
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.600]  can they so he's accurately predicted what would happen what's coming next
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.920]  where are we currently what's up next with Lyndon LaRouche sir thank you for
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:26:00.880]  joining us today good how do you do I'm okay here in grave times but where again
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.600]  you've accurately predicted where are we currently where are we going we're
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.640]  right on the edge of some of your war as to whether that will happen or not
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:14.840]  that's another question but the likelihood that it could happen is great
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:20.480]  what's happened is the US forces in the eastern Mediterranean under the Persian
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:26.320]  Gulf region especially naval forces in particular our position for a launching
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:32.000]  a thermonuclear war the name of the game of course is what we're going to do to
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.960]  Syria what we're gonna do to Iran but if you look at the forces in the area that
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.600]  makes no sense then you look at other aspects of it and you know the rush now
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:48.480]  the rush is in on the thing in defending Syria in particular against this
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.160]  atrocity and you realize that we're on the edge of actually going to the
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.840]  milky wall what happened was of course that I don't know how much a well this
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:03.080]  is known but our leading general officers who are visors in our and so forth
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:09.080]  was advised us on our security have opposed any action by Obama of this
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:15.880]  type that is so therefore that is in that degree tied up but what's hanging
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:21.720]  out there is that any moment a war could start now this war will be a war with
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:30.200]  thermonuclear weapons that's the fact the idea that this is only Syria and Iran
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:39.200]  is nonsense this thing is what we have positioned in the Gulf area and in
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.320]  east the eastern Mediterranean what we have position is a capability for
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:48.000]  thermonuclear war and nothing else our allies including the British do not have
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.480]  the depth of weapon a weapon capability for doing something like this only the
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.400]  United States and only the thermonuclear welfare capability of the United
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.560]  States could actually conduct such a war it would be a war against entirety of
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:10.440]  Asia and other places where it's now being halted the British are pushing
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:15.080]  this greatly and they were on the edge of it all right you have amazing sources
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.760]  we're going to break in a moment I want to come back and go over this but for
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.320]  those that don't know it's not even getting much attention here it's all
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.840]  over the foreign press Russia many idea of yesterday told Poland and others go
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.640]  ahead move your missiles in we're going to blow them up we're going to destroy
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.480]  them and Russia normally doesn't just make threats just like 888 in 2008 when
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:39.040]  the West attacked South Ossetia and other areas in the Russians rolled in
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.640]  mobile nukes the Russians have said we're going to block your supply routes in
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.680]  the Russian air-controlled route into Afghanistan the Pakistanis are blocking
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.040]  that route Russian ships have shown up in Syria and and and they've moved two
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.360]  months ago US troops out of Iraq into Kuwait and I've talked to people who
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.800]  were involved they're telling them get ready for a giant war so you're right
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.680]  I mean obviously you have a lot of sources but this is incredible well this
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:09.200]  is what we're working against right now the Russian operation is not an
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.440]  actually an aggressive operation but what happened with the following you
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.840]  remember the Syria the elite the the war not Syria rather in Libya now that
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.820]  was rushed through and the intention was and the cycles were definitely from
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:32.200]  Britain was to go immediately to the war against both sorry to interrupt you
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.760]  let's stop right there you you said Syria because that's next on the list
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.120]  obviously the same paradigm but Libya then Syria will we'll talk about the
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:45.080]  geopolitical ramifications Lenin Rouge straight ahead key information stay

[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.400]  Pakistani intelligence Hami Ghoul on and he said yes this could lead to a
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.520]  larger nuclear war the Russians as you said are getting in
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:08.760]  defensive battle formation saying do not attack Syria
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.520]  things are getting wild Lenin LaRouche please continue
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.960]  well we've got to understand the general situation first of all we have a
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.760]  general breakdown of the entire international financial system
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:25.320]  it's worse in the transatlantic region it's less bad
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:32.600]  in the asian region now this we talk about these bankers
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.240]  they're bankrupt we have we're in now in the worst hyperinflation in world
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:42.280]  history right now these bankers don't have anything
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.440]  if you try to redeem any of the claims they think they have
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.000]  they have less than nothing this is empty blank paper
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.120]  passed it for hyperinflation this is being highly managed politically
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:00.040]  by doing all kinds of things to europe and doing things to the united states
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.960]  but this thing is not going to survive these banks
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:10.840]  every blasted one of them is doomed now the only there is a solution for this
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:14.200]  and it's the only solution it's Roosevelt solution Franklin Roosevelt
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.920]  solution glass seal that does not solve the total problem
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.040]  that eliminates the worst problem right now and
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.440]  makes it possible to undertake management of the problem
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.520]  we would also have to create we since the federal reserve system no longer
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.160]  functions it's hopelessly bankrupt it could never be paid up
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.840]  this thing will never be paid off it's doomed
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.720]  so therefore we're going back to the old class classify this thing as
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.240]  off commercial paper that is not backed by anything it's speculative paper
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.480]  and therefore just put it out on its own and let the people try to collect the
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:58.040]  money there's nothing there we have to save a part
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.480]  of our financial system our commercial banking system
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:05.880]  that's with glass steel but that's not enough money to start a recovery and we
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.280]  need now an actual physical recovery because we have people are
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.120]  people are going to start dying massively you look at the food supply
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.920]  for the united states going into the months ahead
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.040]  think about march and april at the present rate
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:23.640]  we're going to have people dying of hunger and affects
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.120]  correlated to that in the united states so therefore we need an immediate
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.800]  reform we understand i do and i get some other
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.880]  people's well-do we go through glass steel that will
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:40.280]  could save the united states temporarily it will also
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.200]  be a vehicle to save western europe temporarily
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:48.600]  because if we do this they'll do it but the other thing we have to do is we have
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.880]  to go back because we don't have a federal reserve system anymore
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.400]  it's bankrupt it's hopelessly bankrupt we therefore have to go
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.840]  back to a hamilton's original policy which was u.s. constitutional policy
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:06.440]  we go back to a credit system not to a banking system not to a money system
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.520]  under a credit system the federal government can authorize
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:15.240]  a federal debt for specific purposes some of these things will be government
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:19.080]  projects totally government projects like the like the tennessee valley
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.920]  authority was a project uh what was a project of the same
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:27.720]  nature but a big much bigger one you have a transportation systems we need
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:31.320]  all kinds of things we need which the federal government is going to have to
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.760]  finance and it has to be financed on good management
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.320]  but then we there are other things we can do we can also get into long-term
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:44.200]  agreements with nations of the world and we can create a fixed
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.120]  exchange system among nations which agree to
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.640]  the idea of glass steel as an equal for their case
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.960]  so stop the global concerted devaluation but shifting back sir
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  the elites the the finance oligarchs and their tropism that you've talked so
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:03.080]  much about they're not going to stop they are
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:07.160]  preparing dodger stadium right now as a giant femacamp kevin boost getting
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:10.120]  video of it there are the under homeland security they're
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:14.760]  arresting the occupiers nationwide as a giant simulation of
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.120]  political arrest as you know they passed the bill
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.440]  to secretly arrest u.s citizens and have you just disappear no one even knows
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.120]  where you go literal deal the disappearances like
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.360]  the come out ruse or something i mean am i right in saying they're going into
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.720]  hyper warp and they've made the decision
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.160]  to go ahead and start wars and have a classic police state
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:40.280]  and and they're going forward i mean it's just come out that henry polson we
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.320]  already knew this gave hedge funds inside
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.920]  information on freddy mac and fanny may when he was treasury secretary well
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.840]  of course he did i mean these are brazen criminals
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.120]  well you've got you've got look it's very simple we can deal with it
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.880]  if the american people have the guts to do so and the temperament and their
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.400]  direction is strong right now as you probably know
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:05.720]  that if you move this president obama out of office
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.160]  on the basis of his charge that he's insane
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.720]  that's under the 25th amendment section four he qualifies for expulsion from
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.000]  the presidency on the on the basis of that
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.160]  also at the same time you've got other things he's also
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.960]  committed crimes against the constitution the libya war was a crime
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.720]  it was a violation of the constitution he's done many other things many of his
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.760]  so-called laws of violations of the constitution
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.200]  the attempt to prevent the congress the members of the congress from
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.280]  appealing and what was a fraud against the government
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:46.520]  in this war in in libya is typical the what what people have to have the guts
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.880]  to do many people realize that obama has to be
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.320]  out of office they what they're not realizing is he has to be
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:57.720]  out of office now and there are two ways to get him out
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.360]  one is to impeach him but the other the more immediate and more effective one
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.640]  is the fact that he is clinically insane
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.840]  and his insanity is of a very specific type
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:13.160]  which is explicitly specified in the 25th amendment
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:19.320]  section four all the evidence is there lift him out of the presidency
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:24.280]  and i can guarantee you that a lot of things will change
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.120]  very quickly sure and again of course he is
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.200]  spoiled milk i mean he politically now has a lower approval rating than
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.720]  richard nixon at the bottom and of course jimmy carter
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:41.480]  but the the corezines and the robert rubens and the people behind him
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.800]  they don't care they're going ahead with this
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:51.800]  homicidal alluding of the system so my question is i agree with your solutions
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.240]  on that front you're absolutely right great ideas sir
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.440]  you called for it long before these these crises even again
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:01.720]  what i'm saying is they don't appear to be stopping
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.200]  they don't care it's like corezine making a 40 to one bet
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.360]  on euro bonds and then stealing his account holders private money
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:14.680]  it's admitted to be illegal the head of the cftc's invested with him and just
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.360]  says we're going to allow it i mean they're entering a psycho land
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.400]  will they be allowed to just steal and destroy everything
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:26.040]  is my question i mean what does mf global you got one vulnerability has come
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:30.760]  to one point right now a few people with the guts in
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.680]  the world can sink the whole thing immediately
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:40.840]  and the there are solutions but the key thing here now one thing
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.400]  if you do this one thing you're going to uncork everything
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.760]  and give a chance to the united states and other nations to survive
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.920]  that one thing is get this president out of office
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:57.880]  now if you don't get him out now you were probably going to have
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.760]  some nuclear war from which very few people will survive
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.400]  it was a choice have we ever got the guts to throw this bum out of office now
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.360]  when the evidence for it exists are we going to be gutless
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:16.680]  and get into this kind of hell from which the human species itself might not
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:21.000]  exist do we have the guts to save the world
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.600]  are we well how do you get rid of obama because that would cause kind of a
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.200]  breakup of things and allow new ideas to be injected
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.800]  because clearly he is narcissistic clearly he's
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.160]  constantly partying and in la la land and playing golf
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:39.720]  six hours a day i mean you look at him he does act like he's completely
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:44.920]  out of his mind and he's a british puppet he's not an american
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.160]  that that election of his was a big fraud it was
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.040]  the complications of how this was pulled but mainly it was british money
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.280]  and british drug money which is the big factor in flooding
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:01.800]  him into the presidency actually on the basis of
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.480]  counting the votes in one way on the democratic side
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:12.200]  he lost the democratic nomination on in fact but because of a special feature
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.840]  the way the thing was run he was put in as the nominee
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:20.440]  for the election a democratic nominee he shouldn't have been there in the first
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.560]  place how does getting rid of obama help i mean i
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:27.000]  how does that help i can guarantee you personally
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.480]  that getting rid of obama in this way in this time
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.920]  and you'll save the united states if you don't do this
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.880]  if you don't get obama out now in this time when the legal basis for doing so
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.400]  exists very clearly then you're not going to save the united states no but
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:48.680]  explain to me the chain reaction what what what is that vacuum if the if this
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:52.200]  puppet of the corrupt elements of wall street and finance capital
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.000]  if he was removed for all the fast and furious the illegal wars
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.800]  you know the mafia stuff the list goes on and on
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.840]  but don't look at it the american people hate this guy now
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.560]  they hate him and they hate him for good reasons
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.880]  he's there's there's nothing protecting him if you take away
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:19.000]  take out of his hands the powers of the president
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.640]  at that instant you're going to get a sudden change in the united states
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.440]  because the people in the united states are ready for it
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.040]  the problem is many of them don't have the guts
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.040]  to do what they should do okay what do we do to get obama out of there because
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.320]  then we get a biden i mean what's let's say obama
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:40.440]  you know for corruption charges whatever went by by what happens
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:44.200]  no you have to remove obama because he's a dictator
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.720]  you move the dictator and you don't have to worry about these other problems
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.800]  so much the american people given the choice now
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:56.280]  and the choice is take obama out of the picture you're saying it's that symbolic
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.560]  symbol of the puppet would be dictator removed
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:03.080]  will send shock waves through the structure there won't be that executive
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:07.320]  fear factor it'll be seen as a blow a vote against the direction we're going
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.080]  and will automatically steer energy towards other solutions
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.360]  it will also cause elements of the government
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:18.920]  and key parts of the government to take the action that's needed
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.360]  and they have with obama out not in the white house
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.120]  not in power to the white house those other elements
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.880]  of our federal government which i know will act in an appropriate way
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.920]  to end this nonsense that does not mean we're going to have everything solved
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.920]  automatically but we're going to have the power of the decision to decide what
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.360]  is done given back to the american people
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.640]  and that will happen the anger in this population
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.600]  in the u.s. population against what's being done to them
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:54.760]  what has been done to them they are ready to act
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:58.920]  they don't they're not mobilized in their mind is to know how to act
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.800]  we have to put in their hands the means to act and once they realize we've
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.560]  given them the means to act and made some suggestions of what the
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.720]  measures are that have to be dealt with in order to bring this about
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.880]  i can guarantee you if i weren't as old as i am
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:20.280]  i'd be running for president on the basis of filling in the
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:24.520]  absent term of obama and so you could inject real issues now now
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:28.600]  expanding on this looking at what's currently happening
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.880]  i know you have amazing sources in government the military you name it
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:34.840]  that's been admitted by the washington post and others
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:37.400]  uh i mean again former head of the national security council said you had
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.480]  the best private intelligence network out there
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:43.240]  and i'm getting it my through my feelers the same things you're getting
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.200]  and a lot of it of course months later manifests in the mainstream news
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:49.560]  so there's major credibility here from my position your position
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.320]  our research our history of giving people you know factual information
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.400]  people can debate our our analysis the info but the info stands
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:03.400]  on its own you say you're being told that the military has already said no
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.480]  to launching this this new world war three that so many obama advisors have
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.920]  asked him to launch so that well the relevant the relevant evidence
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.640]  elements in turn the u.s command structure and we're in a situation now
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.640]  we're dealing with people in other countries as well on this question
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.840]  we have to we have to get we have to get the
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:28.360]  coordination we have significant cooperation for doing what is
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:33.080]  necessary number one no terminus war
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:41.320]  which means no no repetition of libya no war in syria no war against iran
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.160]  because all these wars if they are allowed to occur
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.880]  will mean thermonuclear war once the trigger is set because now we're on
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:54.760]  china and russia's border yes no not a not just on that
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.560]  you've got a situation in which the power to declare war
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.720]  which is now in the hands of the president and he's not going to listen to
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.160]  anybody else while he's still president it's setting a very dangerous
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.160]  president and just like hitler or of course
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.440]  we have the examples of other people like napoli and once they start down this
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.880]  road we can clearly see where it's going so let me ask you this question you
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.040]  say in the command structure they're saying no we knew fox fowlin did that
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.480]  four or five years ago we know there's been other examples you're saying
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.760]  your military sources are telling you there's already been internal
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.720]  basically rebellions against launching of these new attacks
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.960]  there is there is there's a special group of people who have
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:47.080]  the authority to put their voice in to say whether war should be launched or
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.520]  not as long as the chances there as long as we're not
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:55.560]  attacked and now the point is if this president is in charge
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:59.960]  he is going to pull the strings under british orders
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.240]  it's going to be british orders but it's going to be american muscle
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.360]  we have the greatest concentration of thermonuclear warfare
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.600]  capability stations in the eastern mediterranean it's u.s largely
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.520]  it has the other jokers in but it and also in the
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.360]  persian gulf we have enough thermonuclear power
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:23.800]  based there to try to take out asia
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.160]  and get and and and you're right and by the way it's admitted especially in the
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.760]  foreign press the russians are buzzing around like an ant hill
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:34.600]  that's been disturbed right now on total defense alert
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.080]  let's come back and talk about this straight ahead
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.080]  and russia's saying you move the the missiles we know you've moved in
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:45.320]  into pollen we're going to go ahead and attack so i mean it it's just
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.640]  total red alert right now and it's because the banksters are making their
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:53.480]  move they're making their move and they are completely crazy
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.440]  like max keiser says they're suicide bankers

[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:08.760]  transmission possible. Lenin LaRouche is our guest you were
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.920]  getting back to nuclear war what does it mean to have the
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.440]  russians on alert sending their ships into the
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.600]  Mediterranean uh and as you said they've moved all these
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.200]  us cruisers and subs in with nukes like you're saying the
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:27.640]  the the military buildup is not for a conventional war
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.480]  please continue it's not an conventional war there is no conventional war
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.560]  the conventional war is not possible actually since the
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.080]  time when i was launching what became known as the sdi
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.480]  and the sdi principle even though the circumstances are modified today
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:47.160]  by time nonetheless the same principle is crucial
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:51.240]  we there can be no major war on this planet
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.760]  involving major powers which does not lead to
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.680]  thermonuclear war in other words it would be
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:03.480]  on with libya you came up to the edge of it but it was already the potential
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.720]  back in the nineteen 1970s when i first got on
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.720]  doing this thing with about on the sdi program
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:18.680]  and because it was impossible to fight major war among with major powers involved
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.120]  that would not lead to thermonuclear war that's been the state of affairs
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:28.200]  since the 1970s well cheney tried to do it through nato with the russians in
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.040]  2008 the russians just rolled mobile nukes in and said we're
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.560]  and the head of their joint chiefs went on tv and said we're preparing to
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:39.160]  launch nukes on your forces and nato turned back i mean what's
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:42.840]  wrong with nato what's wrong well what's wrong with everybody
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:45.800]  but the point is the coward the like the coward is
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:52.840]  and i mean nixon rather reagan twice put up the sdi as a solution
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:56.280]  the british stomped it the united states were was considering it
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.400]  but the british intervene and said as your big ally
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:03.240]  we say no and that's why reagan was turned down then you got a couple of
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:07.640]  british agents on drop-off and gobbledog
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:11.800]  who became one of the key figures in russia and the soviet union then
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:15.240]  and they were responsible gobbledog is still around
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:20.040]  he's still a damn nuisance in the world and a pesky one he's a british agent
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.760]  he always was incredible little leisure with us for 20 more minutes we got a

[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.680]  i want to get your view on what your program of sdi would have done to

[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:22.760]  live from austin texas alex jones

[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:30.200]  about here and we've predicted and told you everything that's coming
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.880]  and no amount of trillions of dollars pumped into europe will stop the
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:37.160]  the derivative black hole the banksters know that and they think
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.960]  they can pose and use the controlled media to come out on top and and be our
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:46.840]  saviors in the crisis they created and all these public papers they put out
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:49.720]  they say obama needs a new oklahoma city
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:53.560]  to blame on people financial times of london they act like we're not even
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:56.440]  here mr larouge you've studied these people a long time
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.960]  is it megalomania hubris or do they really think they're gonna win
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:07.880]  why are they so naked in what they do uh you know get into sdi
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:11.320]  where we're going all of this well look at the look at the history of the
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:14.840]  united states what we and it actually started
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:21.480]  in in 1620 when some people from england and from probably venevils as well
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:25.240]  came over to massachusetts and set an emotion
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:30.440]  uh what was initially the pilgrim landing but then was the massachusetts
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:35.000]  bay colony now the massachusetts bay colony was crushed
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.640]  uh with the by the british at a certain point
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.560]  but we didn't stop there we continued to develop
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:47.240]  united states we imported people from europe and so forth
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:52.200]  into what became the united states and we continued from 1620
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:56.520]  on through the securing of our freedom our constitutional freedom
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:02.440]  we continued as an alternative to britain to the british empire which had
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:06.680]  become an empire in that period so we were the we were the english
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:10.440]  speaking we drew people from all over europe at first
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  and then we later we drew from asia as well in the later part of the period
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.760]  going into the 20th century we created in the united states
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:23.640]  the greatest movement for freedom that mankind is ever known
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:29.480]  for the greatest duration against what was still going on in europe
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:33.960]  it wasn't not wasn't that the europeans lacked a culture european culture
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:37.240]  but they were like an effective culture because their system of government
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:43.560]  was dominated by the british empire ever since 1763 the british empire has
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:47.320]  dominated europe with a few brief exceptions
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:50.920]  through the entire period they control africa totally
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:54.840]  they controlled and committed mass genocide in india
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:58.840]  to consolidate their power there they ran the drug war
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:02.920]  against china they organized world war one
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.480]  but they started already with the assassination of the president of france
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:13.000]  at that time so this operation this empire this
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.760]  imperial system which controls africa as a slave
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:20.520]  state entirely still today which controls europe for
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.960]  example today in europe and most in western central europe
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:30.440]  no sovereign nation state exists in western europe they all lost their
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:34.840]  authority to the euro system which has no government
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.280]  the government is the british government which runs the euro system
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:42.680]  and then and then acts like it's it's it's being abused by the euro but review
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:49.000]  look helps set up the treaty of rom in 57 on record they run everything and the
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.040]  point is it's still us we we because we do represent
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.480]  and you know from generation to generation we die you know in time
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:00.840]  everyone dies but we aren't dead because we are
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:04.920]  committed to a principle which lives on after we die
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.000]  and those of us in the united states who still believe
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.160]  and stand by that principle which we embedded and expressed in our constitution
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:18.440]  still exists the problem is other people become confused
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.000]  or they doubtful of their powers they doubtful of their ability to intervene
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.480]  when we make a decision like as i propose we must make in the united
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:32.280]  states now throw this bum out i guarantee you
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.840]  you will get a surge a response from our american people in a very large
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:40.760]  number we'll look at this as a sign of relief
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:44.520]  exactly it would be seen as a major signal
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.280]  you know kind of like the cavalry coming stay right there little really

[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:30.040]  calls go to some other news we haven't covered
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:34.280]  websites larouche pack dot com they also have what the loose
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.720]  hub they have their publications you know i really wish this stuff wasn't true
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:42.440]  or real i mean i can't think about anything but the
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.000]  financial situation the dollar devaluation the depression all the
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:51.320]  numbers coming out a design depression a bunch of
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:55.800]  control freaks with waging war against our society
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:01.160]  command destruction it's incredible and little russ was talking about the
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:05.560]  american system versus this imperial
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:13.880]  crony centralized neo feudal system and the whole eugenic situation this
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:17.560]  this anti-human movement and there's no doubt they're
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:24.600]  barreling towards megabanks owning europe and all their sovereignty transferred
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:27.960]  to it and they call it a united states of europe
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.320]  as a sick joke as if a financial tyranny is the united
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:36.120]  states model uh yes i call them the patriot act patriotic
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:39.720]  linden larouche i wanted to ask you about the bill that was
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:44.920]  passed last night that says the government the military can operate in
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:48.200]  america and arrest citizens and hold them without trial
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:52.920]  for no reason and i played clips earlier of uh
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.360]  lindsey grand the sponsor of it admitting that
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:59.880]  and then obama plays this cheeky game of saying well i'm not going to sign it
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:02.920]  that's because last year he said i can hold citizens and use the army i don't
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.000]  need a law he's saying i have the executive so a lot of
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.640]  just amazing things happening now they've got a new bill to allow torture
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:16.120]  that articles up at info wars dot com headline senate considers bill authorizing
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:20.360]  more torture and uh the news is just running around
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:23.640]  acting like it's a great thing this is so incredible
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.480]  what if they have their way you've talked about solutions and different
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:31.800]  systems if they continue if this group continues
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:36.600]  uh and they're drive for absolute domination over everything
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:40.120]  so there's no room for the nouveau riche no room for intellectuals
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:43.880]  no room for any science they want a post industrial world
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.320]  a neo feudal model as you said the british eugenics model
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:50.280]  what is going to happen to our country what what are we going to see in the
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:55.720]  short and then mid and long term if we don't act now
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.480]  we're going to find we're in a thermonuclear war it's going to happen
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.200]  if we don't act now to get this president out of office
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.640]  if you don't pull this president out of office you're going to have a thermonuclear
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:11.560]  war now if we don't have him out of office
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:14.680]  don't worry about anything you're all going to be dead anyway the british
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.040]  policy and they said it the british royal family
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:22.520]  the extended family the whole blue blooded crowd
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:27.480]  have said repeatedly they are now committed to the immediate objective
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.720]  of reducing the world's population from seven billion people
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:37.800]  to one or less that is the policy of the british monarchy
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:42.760]  the british monarchy controls all of europe from the atlantic
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:48.840]  into central europe directly they control the euro system control
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:52.840]  totally they control the forces that have been
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:56.680]  including our stupid forces themselves who are working under obama's direction
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:00.680]  under british direction for a war in the middle east
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:04.520]  it will be a thermonuclear war because it will not be limited to
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:10.280]  iran it will not be limited to syria it will go to the entirety of asia
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:13.880]  that's what's at stake look at the amount of force look at the thermonuclear
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.360]  and related capability of the u.s and augmented forces from europe and so
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:22.600]  forth which are deployed in the Gulf of you know
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.440]  iran and in the in the eastern part of the Mediterranean
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:33.160]  that force is there to fight a war that war is not limited to syria
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:40.760]  and to iran that is war once it starts as the russian deployment shows you
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:44.360]  that war when it starts will be a thermonuclear war
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:48.040]  as the president of russia in certain terms have warned
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:53.160]  the world in the past two days so the stage is set
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:56.600]  the question is who's going to come on stage
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.920]  is the american freedom going to come on stage and throw obama out
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:05.240]  because if he don't throw obama out now when we have the charges for doing so
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:12.520]  then we are condemned to this war so we find the guts to win or we lose
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.720]  and no it's not a question of what people think you know in decision
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.520]  when you have to make a command decision as a leader of a nation
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.600]  or like the american republic there are times that comes
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:29.320]  that you have to make a decision on behalf of the people
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.360]  do you want what is happening to our people now
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:35.480]  do you think the majority of the people in this country wants what's happening
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:39.480]  to them now of course they don't but they don't think they have the
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.880]  authority or the backing for someone to clean the mess
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.120]  up and we all we have in our terms of
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:53.960]  responsible people in the senate in the houses of congress and parties in part
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.880]  they all and it says more or less will agree on some things
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.680]  but they hesitate to take on throwing out a president who should be thrown out
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:05.560]  if somebody takes it takes that has the guts
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:08.840]  and the qualifications to throw the bomb out of office
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.440]  i guarantee you you will have a complete change in the policy of the american
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:15.480]  people into in practice and we can win this thing
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:21.000]  but we don't have much time i agree with you we don't have much time and
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  everyone i talked to not just geopolitically not just intellectually
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.880]  in everybody's gut people are really concerned
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:33.240]  and you know i go back to mf global i mean they've never
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:37.080]  taken three billion dollars of people's private accounts and just said we're not
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.920]  even going to investigate we're keeping the money
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.000]  and now they're doing that i mean it's it's it's it's there may have been a
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.240]  method of the madness before but when you talk about an inbred power structure
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:51.560]  who a lot of them are just educated idiots
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.400]  the sky's the limit i mean this is like caligula or nero
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:02.600]  understanding history linda marush and knowing what the breaks are right now
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:06.360]  what do you see happening i mean i mean you you said with your intelligence and
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:11.400]  pentagon connections high level groups are telling them no no no but is that
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.440]  enough to stop them is that a good sign
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:17.800]  uh... what what what are folks there in virginia and dc
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:20.760]  uh... at the highest levels you talk to what are they telling you what are the
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:24.440]  europeans you talk to telling how does israel fit into all this
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:28.680]  of israel is it israel's a puppet think that's not that's not really an issue
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:32.120]  uh... the issue here is this was the united states going to do
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:35.720]  and what are other countries going to do i can guarantee you
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:40.200]  if we throw a bomb out of office we're going to have cooperation
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:45.480]  full cooperation from russia from china
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:49.800]  probably from india and from other countries we're going to find that the
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:54.200]  the world is going to have a kind of unity at the moment before
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:57.800]  frankenrhodsel died when we virtually had won
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:02.760]  world war two people are now at a point of anxiety
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:07.720]  that if somebody puts the solution before a hungry man
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:12.600]  on a plate and the man hungry man is seeing his children starving
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:16.520]  and somebody's going to come by the solution they're not going to have
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:22.600]  be very fussy about finding out why they're doing what they're doing
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:26.760]  they know what they're doing they're trying to get their country back
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:31.400]  and we have most of the people in the united states want their country back
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:35.480]  if a few of us in responsible positions of leadership
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.920]  act within the provinces of our constitution
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:41.960]  to take an action to throw this president out of office
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:45.880]  even if the initiative is made by a relatively few people
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.560]  if it's made and made under the proper law
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:54.840]  you'll find a rejoicing in the streets throughout much of the united states
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:58.120]  and you'll be hiding obama someplace where nobody can get at him
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:02.440]  because you're not going to have him killed
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:05.640]  sure go ahead go ahead that'll change everything
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:09.800]  but the palm times it takes leadership does mean something
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:13.080]  there's bad leadership but there are times when
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:19.000]  the world cries for someone to act on behalf of justice and you're just
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.800]  pointing out that even though it's symbolic and he's a puppet of very
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:25.080]  wicked people you know the fact that their puppet falls
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:28.760]  and they don't go through the regular cycle of a new republican puppet
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:33.640]  that would be seen as a major uh point to crystallize
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:37.000]  uh some real ideas of sanity being brought in
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.840]  but what about what about the same forces trying to bring in
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:44.520]  just another new puppet i mean look at newt genrich look at all these people
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:50.840]  i know but let's take a look at d-day look at the streets in new york city on
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:53.320]  d-day
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.000]  when we'd won the war
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.360]  and if unfortunately we got truman and instead of
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:04.440]  roselt later if roselt had a contender as president we'd never have any of
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:08.840]  these problems sometimes the our chief executive or the
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:13.480]  circles which are our chief executive collectively of our constitution
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.240]  when the people in our country do know something about our constitution
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:21.800]  they have some sense of it but they may not know all the details
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.640]  but they do know right from wrong in that sense
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.720]  what's needed now is leadership in the united states which will remove this
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:34.520]  president from office immediately that will put into play
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:38.920]  immediately in the congress especially in the senate
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:41.880]  and some of the key people in the house of our presenters
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.920]  will put them into motion immediately to change a great number of things
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:49.880]  suddenly that doesn't mean everything is going to be solved
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:52.760]  but it means we're going in a completely different direction
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:57.160]  and we're going away from thermonuclear war
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:02.600]  and that is what we have to do now there are no preconditions required for
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:05.080]  doing that
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:07.880]  give us some of the websites there's larushpack.com

[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:39.080]  deep mindset of the oligarchy and and what they think they're going to get
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:42.280]  out of this because obviously it's leading them like hitler
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:45.960]  into russia or or or others on ill-fated journeys and
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:48.840]  they're not going to make it out of this they may succeed in wrecking
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:51.640]  everything but there's got to be a point when this ends
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:54.280]  little russia just give us five more minutes on the other side and then

[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:24.280]  all right my friends it's our final segment when larouge has been very
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:27.800]  gracious spending so much time with us very busy man
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:33.320]  larougepack.com and his analysis is spot on you cannot deny we're at this
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:37.160]  point because the world is imploding these globalist
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:41.400]  always start wars and it is the british empire model
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:45.640]  we face so in closing so that we know the enemy not the english and british
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:50.440]  people are the uk but that parasitic system there
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:54.520]  that through all of europe's wars develop the most cunning manipulative
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:59.320]  system ever seen who are they what are they what do they stand
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:02.840]  for how do they see a way out in this
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:07.560]  whether we don't know some of the history but we do know that way back
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.120]  in the mediterranean vicinity there was a development of what we called
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:17.720]  oligarchal systems in which the a few people a small
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:21.400]  part of the population were treated were called gods
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:26.680]  they were treated as gods and the ordinary people were treated as cattle
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:33.240]  now that system of gods and cattle has continued in european civilization in
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:38.600]  particular from that time to the present day in great britain
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:42.680]  the british empire is nothing but a revival of the again
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:46.840]  the third for the fourth time of a roman empire
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:50.440]  which has started in Rome which is features such creatures as the
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:53.960]  emperor nero and the our current president of the united states has a
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:58.120]  personality identical psychologically or pathologically
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:03.000]  to the emperor nero but that we in the united states
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.960]  succeeded in establishing a system which was anti oligarchical
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:11.080]  in which the right of the individual citizen
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:17.000]  as a citizen was out of a human being which had a right not only to live but
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.800]  right to pass on the meaning of their life to coming generations
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.120]  and this was our our a special achievement in the united states
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:31.320]  by the people who left uh... england left belt itself was left to europe and
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:34.680]  came to this territory to build up this united states
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:38.200]  now we were weak relative to the british empire
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:41.240]  because the british empire does control the world there is
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:44.760]  all of africa is controlled by the british empire there's no exception to
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:48.600]  that most of the world is controlled by the british empire
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:51.880]  there's no exception to that you have people within the system
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:56.680]  who are part of the imperial territory who will resist inside the territory
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.680]  but they won't they won't break it we in the united states
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:05.800]  with all our failures our failed presidents are goofing up the issue
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.440]  itself what we have remained in the tradition
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:14.440]  of what the american system is which is actually founded in europe by other
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.760]  people but was achieved in the united what became the united states
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.720]  and therefore we have a special responsibility
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:28.040]  and we are also respected for example in asia that we tend to get respect
[02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:31.080]  because we are we're opponents of this kind of
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:35.880]  oligarchal system we've always been the great engine of at least the the lofty
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:39.240]  ideals didn't mean we ever properly lived up to it
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:43.960]  and to see america now used as an engine of corruption to see other countries
[02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:48.600]  use us as an excuse to engage in tyranny that's got to please the finance
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:51.880]  oligarchs yeah but the point is what does it
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:56.680]  hurt it hurts every parent who has children
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.200]  because the secret of the united states does not lie
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:03.720]  in those of us who are living or who have lived
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:07.720]  the secret of our united states lies in the heritage
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:11.640]  yes of creativity and this and related benefits
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:18.040]  which we pass on to future we may die but we live in what we contribute to the
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:22.040]  future that's the difference of our system
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.040]  and the typical british our oligarchal system that's right the their birthright
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:31.080]  is only to the oligarchy this is a birthright of free humanity goodwill
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:35.160]  peace true liberty true human revolution against tyranny
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:38.600]  and as the declaration of independence constitution it all talks about
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:44.600]  the posterity the living thing and and and it is a living thing
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:49.000]  yeah well we see we're living in a galaxy and i just applied
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.480]  as a whole system we're living inside a galaxy this galaxy for some of us who
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:57.080]  study these things has a history it has a history in
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:00.520]  terms of the forms of life over the last half billion years
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:04.680]  which we know something about and in this we find the emergence of
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:08.280]  species from singers songs these species on the way up
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:12.040]  we finally get into the antecedents of mankind
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:15.960]  with the passage of the dinosaurs and people like that and things like that
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.760]  and we we become a conscious factor animals don't have a conscious factor
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:24.040]  in shaping what the destiny of this animal species will be
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:28.920]  human beings do and our what is immortal in us
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:32.760]  is our power of the imagination the creative imagination
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:38.360]  to develop the ideas of what mankind shall be and how it shall function true

[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:22.440]  going to do in response to tyranny it isn't till the
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:27.800]  tyranny gets really naked that people start to fight back
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:31.400]  and now it's getting to that point the globalists have been experts at plenty
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:34.920]  of entertainment plenty of dumbing down ridiculing
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:40.520]  people that are awake and aware but now it's not working anymore so
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.800]  because they know that we're awake to them and congress has a nine percent
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.320]  approval rating obama has an approval rating lower than nixon
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:52.600]  or jimmy carter that's in the news today
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:56.040]  because they know that we're awake now they just don't care they'll like our
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:58.280]  we'll just arrest you and hold you forever
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:02.040]  all right we'll torture you all right we're gonna go ahead and start taking

[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:16.120]  i mean i feel like somebody who's at the edge of a cliff right now you ever
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:19.480]  jumped off 200 300 400 foot cliff into a lake
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:24.360]  i've done it quite a few times back when i was younger and dumber
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:27.720]  now to jump off a high dive is kind of scary but
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:31.400]  it's that same feeling i mean we're right there and i'm sitting here i read
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:34.040]  the globalist documents i've been right about what i warned about
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:37.960]  but it takes a while for this stuff to develop and now we're here
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:43.800]  and when we knew four years ago that the pentagon refused to attack iran
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:46.760]  people said oh you're wrong they weren't gonna attack see and later it came out
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:49.720]  we were right well they're getting ready again
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:53.960]  and and and it's the ramifications of all of this and where it goes in europe
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:58.360]  collapsing and all of this it it's so incredible
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:01.800]  i want to take five or six calls before the transmission ends today the toll
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.440]  free number to join us i want to get your take on what you've heard today or
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:09.240]  whatever issue you're raising 800 25 at 9 92 31
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:14.200]  800 at 25 at 9 92 31 we had general homie gul on former head of pakistani
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:18.120]  intelligence on that situation lindon larouche of course
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:20.920]  and eric mancal muller we probably want to add him to the guest stuff i know he
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:24.920]  was somebody i added on uh and we have titanerson pop in for five minutes
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:28.520]  right now with his take on all this and a pitch for gold by the way i'm gonna
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:32.360]  go ahead and buy some gold and silver today i'm not waiting anymore it's
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:35.960]  it's just everything is i don't even know if i can
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:40.200]  ah i just wish this wasn't happening
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:43.720]  believe me i know why people bend over backwards to live in denial
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:47.560]  but i remember henry polson clearly an insider trading congress admits they
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:50.840]  involve an insider trading totally illegal it's more than insider trading
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.040]  they give government contracts and pass legislation for money
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.120]  to companies their own family members are executives of and they say well when
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:02.280]  we do it it's okay we've given ourselves an exemption
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:05.080]  and remember henry polson when he was being questioned by
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:09.400]  congressman stern from florida it's an obama deception he said
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:13.960]  who gave you the waiver to give yourself 200 something million dollars
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:16.520]  a bailout money to your own to yourself and he goes
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:20.280]  well i have a trustee i mean i gave i mean i had a waiver
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:23.480]  well who gave you that waiver the justice of the uh the department of
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:25.800]  treasury well who's over the department of treasury
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:33.160]  well uh he started stuttering and he said i am he could barely talk
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:39.720]  he said i am i mean the head of the cftc on record
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:44.280]  is invested with core sign and mf global and it turns out all these insiders
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:48.840]  got warnings and of course how that's going to happen to mf global
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:52.920]  i mean that's the thing they've reached a level of public crime
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:58.280]  that is just staggering it's like espn with the wife of the coach saying yeah i
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:02.360]  watched him rape little boys they had it for 10 years and covered it up
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:04.600]  i mean
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:11.320]  what have we turned into we're just accustomed to giving into evil we're
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:15.240]  accustomed to accepting it and then we're accustomed to all the new fines
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:20.600]  and fees and regulations have been treated like absolute garbage
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:24.200]  we've got to start acting like sovereigns we've got to start acting like the
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:27.720]  bosses it's we the people this is our government our country
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:31.640]  and because we had some liberty it created incredible wealth and now all
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.560]  the crooks in the world ran in here slowly took over getting
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:39.560]  little pieces here little pieces there always making money getting power out of
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.960]  it and then now they've just gotten into total control they're like
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:46.760]  we'll torture you we'll secret arrest you we'll kill you if we want
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:49.400]  they've already been doing all of that but now they want to be able to go into
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:52.040]  their people and say here you're allowed to do this
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:55.480]  now a warning to their people when the white house ordered people to torture
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:58.520]  including children when they got caught they went ahead and
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:02.680]  sent the people that follow the orders to present
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:05.560]  and then bush came out in his memoir last year and said i ordered torture i do it
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:08.680]  again keeping you safe i mean they know they're
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:13.160]  selling the idea that if you give tyrants total control they'll
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:18.200]  protect you really government is like an employee that
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:22.280]  literally has got you licking their boots
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.600]  that's what's happened okay coming up after some calls for closure fraud
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:32.200]  whistleblower found dead msnbc another one Henry Paulson
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:39.720]  Hank Paulson gave hedge funds inside information on
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:44.760]  freddy mac and fanny may when he was treasury secretary
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:48.040]  and it goes on to say well i'll cover that in a moment after some calls but i
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:52.200]  briefly wanted to bring ten Anderson up Ted can you feel the urgency and people
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:56.200]  know i've never really gotten like talk like this on air i mean i can feel it

[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:27.240]  bailout thing that's going to be going on in europe
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:30.280]  just the day before the president's out there saying that the united states
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:33.880]  dollars are not going to be uh committed to fixing this problem
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:37.240]  and here we have the problem being bailed out this is like what happened in
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:40.680]  tarp but it's on steroids i mean right now
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.360]  back when when tarp was being doled out it was said to be seven hundred billion
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:47.960]  dollars but it turned out to be seven point seven seven trillion dollars
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:52.760]  by the fed underneath and uh under disguise without without any you know
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:57.880]  just you know any uh any uh disclosure uh these banks
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:00.920]  that were taking the money were in trouble yet they were reporting that
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:03.800]  they're in great shape to their shareholders so
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:06.280]  you know what they're trying to do is they're trying to stop or run on the
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.440]  banks and this does it it it totally sells our country and our
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  sovereignty the sovereignty out we are losing our liberty
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.520]  and we are turning it over we are taking money directly out of the accounts
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:21.640]  of people's savings and so on and so forth through inflation
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:25.880]  and driving the value of the dollar down and uh and and you're talking about
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.240]  world war three here i mean it's just ridiculous
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:33.880]  and and you know so why would anybody want to stay in a paper currency
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:37.400]  when they know the fed is out there pumping new money into the system so
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.240]  they can lower interest rates and make it easier for these banks in
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:45.080]  in europe to trade it's just absolutely a bailout
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:49.080]  like we had in wall street you're not too long ago they're they're helping their
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:52.200]  buddies but at the at the cost of the of the
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:56.840]  us taxpayer and it is it's devastating and it's not only devastating here
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:00.040]  it's devastating devastating across the entire world
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:07.160]  mckel porka porka rob the billionaire over in the soviet union was saying that
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:12.280]  it's safer to buy gold bars than it is to buy us treasuries
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:17.000]  i mean it's gotten down to that people always went to us treasurers for safety
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.440]  always in investments if you're ever concerned about the economy
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:23.080]  the united states treasury was the place to go
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:26.680]  now we're sitting here and the billionaires across the world are saying
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:31.160]  nope we're going to gold gold bars and gold coins make a lot more sense
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:35.000]  than any other investment entirely in the world so yeah
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.160]  is it time to take advantage of it is a time to move absolutely you can see it
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:42.920]  the handwritings on the wall when i like ed i want to invite you on the
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:46.920]  nightly news tonight we've got sturt roads joining us but i want to get you
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:50.520]  on too just to go to the history of inflation
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.080]  and to give some examples but also you can dig up the articles and show people
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:59.160]  you know how big these bailouts are but yeah obama yesterday was giving speeches
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:02.760]  saying there'll be no federal reserve us dollars
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:05.800]  given to this and here's bloomberg today it was already happening i mean it's
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:09.320]  just the they take advantage of people's ignorance
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:12.520]  and people say well so what do they bail them out
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:16.280]  it devalues the dollar and they're devaluing all the currencies they have
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:19.640]  accelerated it and most economists i talked to they say
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:21.880]  within six months you're going to really see it
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:27.000]  and he talked to salente uh you know who and he's saying look they're going to
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  start grabbing more bank accounts more stuff
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.240]  mf global i mean ted the mf global thing is what's shaking me up
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:36.760]  because i went back and studied some of the cases and i you know i had remembered
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:40.200]  what had happened but i wanted to make sure i was right and i went back and
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:45.320]  looked at it they've never had a chicago mercantile big
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.720]  looting with a company bankruptcy with subsidiaries that took
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:55.560]  uh sequestered private accounts segregated accounts
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:59.000]  they've never had anything like this even when whole companies go under they've
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.120]  paid people back now they're just saying we're not doing it
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:05.400]  you know maybe a few people or something but
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:10.760]  it's just so creepy to know that corezine the main advisor is making 40 to
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:15.640]  one bets that's proof these are madmen it's so crazy bob
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:20.840]  chapman thinks it may be some setup where he made the bad bet and they got
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:23.000]  the money on the other side betting against but
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:26.600]  we've looked at it and can't find those numbers i mean these are
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:31.560]  lunatics ted and they've got a bought senate with a bunch of political whores
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:34.440]  most of them who have been you know caught sleeping with the pages so they're
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:37.480]  all blackmailed who are up there saying yeah we're
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:41.480]  going to arrest whoever we want to torture you i mean it's just it to be
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:46.040]  totally confirmed that we've been absolutely right and then some ted
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.120]  it's disgusting i feel like throwing up i'm not happy that i'm right
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:54.360]  i mean i can't i can't enjoy anything now you know i can't even go to movies
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:57.320]  now ted i can't do anything i can't do anything now
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:00.920]  all i think about is this ted and i can't even get people i know
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:05.320]  to realize how real this is well they're going to be realizing how real it is
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:08.440]  when they're standing there in a bread line i mean right now
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.040]  we're covering the bad bets of the of the new york uh
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:15.400]  you know banks and the and the and the big banks in europe
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:18.520]  uh for lending all this money these countries that shouldn't have had it in
[02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:20.920]  the first place and guess who's getting bailed out
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:24.680]  it's the it's them they're the get they're getting the money from us
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:27.880]  they're taking it directly from us through inflation they're printing money
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:31.720]  but if that isn't enough they then grandstand and lecture us
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:36.200]  when 90 plus percent of the debt is theirs and that's exactly right alex and
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:39.000]  they had a vote at the fed i mean that that's why
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:43.320]  ron paul wanted to have transparency transparency of the fed with their
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:46.920]  with their audits we wouldn't even know about ten what about these republican
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:50.280]  mainline idiots that want mit romney and and and
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.600]  genrich i mean there is pathetic as obama supporters these are idiots
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:58.120]  yeah that that's the whole thing that the people of the united states are asleep
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:01.640]  they have no idea what's being happening what's happening to them
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:04.680]  and uh if they were that if they were smart you would see
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:08.200]  uh ron paul showing up a lot higher than 10 12 percent
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:12.760]  he'd be getting 25 30 40 percent of the uh on these polls now maybe they're
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:15.960]  loaded and maybe the you know they're not completely true we'll see what happens
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:19.800]  in iowa but i can tell you right now if the people had
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.080]  half the information or half the knowledge that it took to understand
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.760]  what was going on and it's not even that it doesn't even take a rocket
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:30.120]  scientist to figure this out this is all red level i mean this
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:34.280]  and i i just it just everything keeps happening according to the globalist
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:38.280]  plan and it keeps getting and then and then you this is what it is
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:41.560]  we know we're about to enter the phase where all this horrible stuff's gonna
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:45.720]  look like good times i mean we're about to really
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:49.560]  get into the bad area it's like you go into the doctor and they say
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:52.600]  your heart is completely clogged up you could have a heart attack anytime
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:55.800]  you're like oh i'm fine and a month later you're walking up the stairs and

[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:46.040]  a little bit 523-73 makes an awful lot of sense
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:49.640]  for those of you who don't have a whole lot of money consider the copper coins
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:54.680]  i have up on the website now at 293 for a bag of 250
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:01.400]  the Lakota silvers at 4127 i think the bags of survival dimes at 2495
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:06.120]  that's 1000 dimes you realize it takes 24 dimes to buy
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:09.720]  one new to buy one of the old that's the that's the
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:12.360]  equation right now if you want to transfer one to the other
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:15.960]  that that's going to widen we it's just simply this
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:20.120]  gold and silver is a reflection of what really is happening on in the economy
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:24.360]  and as the fed steps in turns on their printing press to do all this bailout
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:27.640]  you're going to see gold and silver rise and it's just the way absolutely
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.320]  ted 800-686-2237 and we've got Stuart Rhodes on and on about the indefinite

[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.880]  i see these articles all the time we're another foreclosure fraud whistleblower
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:59.320]  found dead msnbc
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:02.840]  and it says a notary public who signed tens of thousands of false documents
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:06.040]  in a massive foreclosure scan before blowing the whistle on the scandal
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:09.560]  has been found dead in her los vegas home
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:12.600]  she was scheduled to be sent it's monday morning and she pled guilty last
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:15.880]  month notarizing the signature individual not in her presence she
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:22.600]  failed to show up for a hearing but police found her dead at the home later
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:25.320]  and they can of course determine what happened but
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:28.600]  they've killed so many pentagon investigators but
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:31.960]  the green light's been given for criminals to run wild in america
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:36.920]  as long as it's under mafia dons government and corporate mafia dons
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:41.160]  and uh it's just open season with the gullible public i feel so
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:45.160]  sorry for them they've been taught for 60 years in this country
[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:48.520]  any criticism of government not loving and trusting government
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:52.760]  is a conspiracy theory of course it's pure americana pure george washington
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:56.520]  to not trust government to keep government small now they're starting to
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:50:01.320]  wake up but they're still very childlike i mean i hear people on talk radio i
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:04.280]  talked to them in the streets and they are so
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:07.960]  childlike they're friendly they're sweet they're
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:13.480]  goofy they have no idea we in this country used to be
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:19.800]  hardcore you know rugged individualists on average
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:25.080]  people didn't care about what happened if you messed with them they'd come
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:29.240]  after you i mean i've read the old letters
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:32.920]  and family bibles and stuff of my ancestors on both sides i mean the
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:36.360]  and they were just standard people and they weren't going around looking for
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:39.640]  trouble either they were church attending hardworking people

[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:48.760]  others and of course you there in colorado a few times great activists
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:51.160]  there and we were there covering the dnc and o8
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:56.280]  we were there uh this is in the news another nest of these people
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:59.640]  yeah this is really kind of amazing stuff uh
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:03.480]  there've been several arrests uh the news is not really coming clear on
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:07.720]  who it is but uh i they generally arrest to cover up the full
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:11.560]  network yeah right yeah exactly well i can definitely
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:15.880]  tell you this is a large ring it definitely involves more than just this
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:18.600]  sheriff's department there are several police department sheriff
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.200]  departments i to probably go as far as to say alex
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.480]  this may involve the cia the fbi the military it's it's kind of conspiracy
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:33.160]  of silence stuff all over again well dine course the biggest cps contractor

[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:55.960]  stellar record and this guy is definitely involved in this major
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:00.440]  stuff okay yeah i've just been given a news
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:03.320]  article there's so many pedophile rings how to keep track of it now now i know
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:06.280]  you say you guys were involved in investigating this a lot of times they
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:10.600]  also sting good people and set them up for this but i'm not saying that's not
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:12.360]  the i mean you guys are ones on the ground
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:16.120]  former rapo sheriff arrested on meth dealing charge and are you saying it's
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:20.360]  in the news here about about the kids um you know they're not talking about
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:24.120]  like underage kids they're kind of playing it off as like he was trading
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:28.920]  methamphetamines for sex but oh yeah that's what it says it says he yeah
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:32.520]  former rapo county sheriff patrick sullivan was arrested on suspicion of
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:37.720]  trading of trying to trade drugs uh to a man for sex as investigators monitored
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:40.760]  the deal yeah and that's how they'll do it we've seen
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:45.160]  that with uh with with the uh boys count and all that they'll they'll bust one
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:48.920]  person to cover it up uh and then kind of minimize what's going on but you're
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:52.360]  saying ellen off was the one who actually got this going
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:56.680]  ellen off was the guy behind the whole deal he spent several weeks working on
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:58:00.920]  this um he was lucky enough to have started working for tom martino at a
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:05.880]  khow radio and tom martino had the guts uh to actually
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:09.720]  help him out and get this thing on the radio they did an interview today
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:13.800]  the information is really i know i've been in tom's studio but i need to get
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:20.360]  martino on then about this of ellen offson hiding
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:23.720]  says this shows that no one is above the law but you're saying ellen off
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:27.320]  is saying from his research it's much bigger much bigger
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:31.880]  the things we know i mean uh there's no doubt about it uh how big it is we're
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:35.240]  not necessarily sure but you know just kind of goes back to something you

[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:42.360]  yeah this reminds me of something you had mentioned i don't know a few weeks
[03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:48.040]  past about how these uh these nwo guys will you know sacrifice some of their
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:50.840]  own people in order to make the rest of their
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:55.720]  people kind of toe the line because something big may be coming down
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:00.840]  and uh i i really suspect that that may be what's going on
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:04.360]  uh yeah i know they will they will bust a bunch of these rings and people to
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:08.040]  scare the rest of them and say see what we can do
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:11.480]  i mean that's who the globalists want they want someone who can be compromised
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:14.200]  they want you to become corrupt it's like serpico they kept trying to get him

[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:48.120]  and and and stuff because the deputies were in a police
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:50.840]  call and they saw the sheriff there and thought it was weird and that started
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:53.640]  the investigation you're saying that's not what happened that that
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:57.400]  ellenoff was involved yeah definitely ellenoff

[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:34.920]  and when i was young i was told that history was written by the victors
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:39.720]  so i chose not to study any history uh thinking that it might be skewed but
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:43.560]  you opened up my eyes to history uh within the last
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:48.040]  two years and i started trying to teach people what you taught me
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:53.480]  and people would place me in a category uh of being a renter
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:56.920]  oh no pretty soon if you know how to tie your shoelaces you're a conspiracy
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:03:01.640]  theorist thought criminal yeah well up in politically correct canada which is
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:04.760]  the politically correct capital of the universe i think
