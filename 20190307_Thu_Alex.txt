[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time Sooner or later, gotta put you down Sooner or later, gotta put you down
[00:26.000 --> 00:40.000]  Welcome on this Thursday, March the 7th, 2019. I'm David Knight, your host today on the Alex Jones show. We've got a lot to talk about. We're going to talk about issues not only of liberty, but we're going to talk about life and death issues, folks.
[00:40.000 --> 00:57.000]  We've got a lot of news about disease, about cancer, about vaccines. Of course, we had Rand Paul yesterday. We talked about the fact that Rand Paul came out and said, look, I get vaccines. I've chosen to have vaccines from my family and myself.
[00:57.000 --> 01:09.000]  We choose the schedule on which we're going to take these vaccines, but everybody ought to have a choice. Then we had a Republican Senator come back and say, No, I don't think you should have a choice.
[01:09.000 --> 01:23.000]  So let's talk about that issue a little bit today. We've got Alex Trebek, the host of Jeopardy, announced yesterday he has stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Very, very concerned for Alex Trebek.
[01:23.000 --> 01:38.000]  So I'm sure as many of you prayed for me on New Year's Eve when I had the heart attack, I'm sure that he would appreciate your prayers as well. But we're going to talk about what the government is doing in terms of cancer.
[01:38.000 --> 01:53.000]  We've just had an announcement that they are going to look at food additives and they have determined that they cause cancer in animals. They're going to ban them, but not until next year sometime. So they're going to continue to allow these things to go there.
[01:53.000 --> 02:06.000]  Why would the government do that? Well, because corporate profits are more important to them than your health. If they say that this is harmful, why wouldn't they ban it now?
[02:06.000 --> 02:22.000]  But they're not going to do that. And for the same reason that they gave vaccine companies immunity from any kind of lawsuits back in 1986, even though there is a somewhat secret vaccine compensation court.
[02:22.000 --> 02:39.000]  You can put that court in quotation marks that has paid out over $4 billion in compensation. There is some good news on the horizon. There was an article about the effectiveness of CBD oil coming out of the UK in terms of treating lung cancer.
[02:39.000 --> 02:57.000]  So we're going to talk about that, but we're also going to talk about larger, longer issues. All of us, as we look at this, all of us want to never die. That's always been the long term promise. We're always looking for ways that we can get eternal life, ways that we can become like God.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  That is the oldest desire, the oldest lie that we've ever been told.
[03:02.000 --> 03:18.000]  And I think that as we look at the movie that is going to be released today for Marvel, not that to put too much on it, but in the forefront, what Marvel is pushing on us is a feminist agenda.
[03:18.000 --> 03:34.000]  As the star Brie Larson calls it, intersectional feminism. Whatever. I mean, if you're like me and you don't care what intersectional feminism is and you don't want to lecture from Disney about it, you probably won't be interested in going to the movie.
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  But if you are going to go to the movie, maybe you ought to think about the bigger issues that are involved in this.
[03:41.000 --> 04:03.000]  Because I think there's something that is far more sinister even than the feminist agenda that's being crammed down our throats, crammed down the minds of our children so that we separate the sexes in the same way that we have separated the races in this country to make sure there's animosity and division.
[04:03.000 --> 04:12.000]  That's really my concern about this. It isn't the roles that women are doing, but the way that Hollywood is putting this out there and slamming it in people's faces.
[04:12.000 --> 04:24.000]  And I think that Brie Larson, better than anybody else, has personified this in-your-face division that is being pushed on us by Hollywood.
[04:24.000 --> 04:33.000]  But folks, in the long term, what is really coming at us with the new technology is transhumanism.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  And the superhero movies have been pushing that idea for quite some time. I'm going to tell you how they're pushing that lie.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  You know, humanism never gave us any hope, it never gave us any reason to follow that, even though that has been the state religion for some time.
[04:48.000 --> 05:00.000]  Humanism is now being transcended by transhumanism, and that is ultimately what these movies lead dangerous, the really dangerous, eternal lie that these movies are pushing on you and your children.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners. This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[05:07.000 --> 05:13.000]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[05:13.000 --> 05:21.000]  X-2 is back. We got it. This deal just happened about a month ago. We rushed it into production. It's been bottled. The labels are being put on today.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler, right here to Austin, from the plant in the Rockies, and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[05:28.000 --> 05:36.000]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off, the 25% off, celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[05:36.000 --> 05:47.000]  Research the iodide conspiracy. Find out why it's so important. Find out why the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens, the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com. They should write the supplements. And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:54.000 --> 06:09.000]  It is X-2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[06:09.000 --> 06:19.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David Knight.
[06:19.000 --> 06:27.000]  Welcome on this Thursday, March the 7th, 2019. I'm David Knight, your host.
[06:27.000 --> 06:33.000]  Today only, we have a special for President Trump. Actually, they might extend this special a little bit longer.
[06:33.000 --> 06:42.000]  We have a company in North Dakota offering to build 234 miles of the border wall for just $1.4 billion.
[06:42.000 --> 06:52.000]  Now, that's a deal. President Trump should go for this deal. I'm sure it's not a limited time offer. But as I've said before, when you look at any government project,
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  just look at the highways, for example. Do you think that we could build the interstate highway system today with this government?
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  No, they'd never build it. Look at the projects in your area.
[07:03.000 --> 07:14.000]  I could go down a list of five or six different road projects here in Austin that have gone on for years and years and have gone over budget and every respect.
[07:14.000 --> 07:24.000]  And it's not just roads. California had to just recently cancel their coveted high speed bullet train that was going to be going through California.
[07:24.000 --> 07:32.000]  Why? Because they can't build anything at cost. How do we manage to continue to build homes, for example?
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  Well, the answer is the government's not doing it. It's private for-profit businesses that are doing that.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  And as I've said many times on my show, you can catch in the mornings starting at 8 o'clock here on this same network, infowars.com.
[07:47.000 --> 07:55.000]  As I've said many times, when you look in your city and you see these neighborhoods going up, they build the roads in no time at all.
[07:55.000 --> 08:11.000]  As a matter of fact, they can build entire neighborhoods in a year or so. And yet here in Austin, we have multiple road projects that are dragging on for a decade or more that are costing way more than they ever anticipated.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  And then once they get finished, we don't have any more road capacity. That's the other thing that is so disgusting.
[08:18.000 --> 08:33.000]  They'll add an additional toll road lane. That's it. And so when I talked about that, I said, President Trump, when we talk about the amount of money that he needs, whether it's 8 billion or 20 billion or whatever it is, that's just the beginning.
[08:33.000 --> 08:43.000]  The government, especially the federal government, will wind up making the wall cost many multiples of that, probably wind up costing 10 times whatever they think it's going to cost.
[08:43.000 --> 08:54.000]  And it'll probably, even if they weren't trying to delay it, even if they weren't trying to delay it, these things typically take several times what they initially anticipated would take.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  If they are trying to delay it, you can forget it ever being done. That's why I said, if President Trump wants to get it done, use the military.
[09:02.000 --> 09:13.000]  It really is, in spite of what everybody is saying, it really is the purpose of the military to defend our country. And if we're not going to do that, stop calling it the Defense Department.
[09:13.000 --> 09:22.000]  Call it the US Mercenary Department or whatever you want to call it. If all we're going to do is regime change, we don't need a military.
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  You can go back to calling it the Department of War. That's what it used to be called. If we're not going to defend this country, then call it something else.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  The President Trump has the authority to defend this country. He has the largest military budget we've ever had. I don't think he needed to declare an emergency.
[09:38.000 --> 09:49.000]  Maybe that would be helpful to get some of the private property aspects that he needs to do in terms of imminent domain to build a wall.
[09:49.000 --> 09:59.000]  But if he's going to get it done, get the same people who built a dozen military bases and four airfields in Syria. And we didn't even know about it.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Right? Did you know about that? We had the discussion years ago between Jeff Sessions and Leon Panetta.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  And Jeff Sessions said, well, you're going to come to Congress right before you go into Syria and you start putting troops in there.
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  And he goes, well, Panetta, who is Secretary of Defense at the time, said, well, we'll let you know what we decide.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  We'll consult with our global partners, the UN and NATO. We'll talk to them and we'll probably let you know what we decide.
[10:27.000 --> 10:36.000]  Well, the jury is in. They may have consulted with those people or they may have just done it, but they didn't tell us, did they?
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  You know, Jeff Sessions at the time was like, go only. I can't believe you do that.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  You were a congressman. You know what the Constitution says. You're supposed to have a vote before you go to war, before you put troops in a country.
[10:47.000 --> 10:55.000]  Well, they didn't. And they built a dozen military bases for airfields in Syria and they've been there for a while.
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  Nobody really talked about it until President Trump said, I'm going to bring home several thousand troops.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  We were told, oh, there's just a couple hundred advisors there.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  And he says, I'm going to bring home 4,000. And they said, well, no, there's 2,000 there, whatever.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  Now they're going to stay, some of them.
[11:11.000 --> 11:19.000]  So, well, it'll just be a few of them staying. Who knows if they're going to bring any of them home or if they're just going to bring some of them home and rotate them out.
[11:19.000 --> 11:28.000]  Nevertheless, they were able to do this quickly and using money in the defense budget without the authorization of Congress.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  I think that's an outrage, frankly.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  But we do have an emergency at the border. We got a story on m4wars.com.
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  Department of Homeland Security says one million illegal immigrants are expected at the border this year.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  It really is an emergency.
[11:44.000 --> 11:55.000]  And we have, as Secretary, Homeland Secretary Nielsen said, they have a massive number of women and children coming across.
[11:55.000 --> 12:04.000]  They give them all pregnancy tests because it is such a common thing for women to be raped in that dangerous passage.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  How about the Me Too movement? You think they'd ever be interested in that kind of thing?
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  I don't think so.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  This North Dakota company said that they would do 234 miles of President Trump's border.
[12:15.000 --> 12:26.000]  They said people who are talking about this right now say the $1.4 billion that they've got would cover 20 miles of Levy Wall in the Rio Grande Valley,
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  along with an additional 214 miles in the surrounding area.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  They would do it for $1.4 billion.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  I think you ought to take them up on that deal.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  That's probably even better than he could get the Army Corps of Engineers to do it.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  And there's absolutely no reason that we would not protect our country, not protect our border, not do it with money from the Defense Department.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  They've even got the illegal war on drugs, the unconstitutional war on drugs.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  It is unconstitutional, folks.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  Don't ever let them tell you otherwise.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  This is something that was a UN agenda conservative.
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  I know that you think even after 48 years, many of you who don't want to see the misery that comes from drug addiction,
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  you think that law enforcement can solve this problem.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  A lot of people in law enforcement will tell you otherwise.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  History will tell you otherwise.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  We've been doing this for 48 years.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  Ten years before Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs in 1971 with the schedules that we have now.
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  Ten years before that, the UN created that schedule, and all of the drugs put them in all of those different schedules,
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  and basically he just turned in the homework from the United Nations.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  You like what has done to our country so far?
[13:36.000 --> 13:45.000]  We had alcohol prohibition, and we realized that it was a failure before we went 48 years with that failure.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  We also respected the Constitution enough that we passed a constitutional amendment.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  Of the 20-some-odd amendments, we've got two of them that are about alcohol prohibition.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  The 18th put it in, the 21st took it out.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  Why did they have that?
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  It's because everybody knew that with the Constitution, the 9th and 10th Amendment,
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  they don't have the power to prohibit anything.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  Now, as we look at Rand Paul talking about this bill to end the Afghan war,
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.000]  we have a situation now where everything is all wars are permitted unless expressly prohibited.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  That's basically what we have with our freedoms.
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  Everything in this country that was protected in the Bill of Rights is now prohibited unless expressly permitted.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  We have turned the Constitution upside down and inside out.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  We no longer respect individual liberty in any way, shape, or form.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  I'm going to talk a little bit about that in terms of help.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  We're also going to talk about free speech.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  There's a lot of free speech issues.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  We're going to talk about the Marvel matriarchy that they're so happy about.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  They're being sold to us by Disney.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  But the bigger issue, I think, is transhumanism.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  We're going to be joined later in the broadcast.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  We're going to have Katie Hopkins joining us here in studio.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  Before we do real quickly, let's just talk before we go to break.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  We're going to go to break in about a minute and a half here.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  As I said at the top of the hour, as the show began, some radio stations don't care that.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  They've got a news break.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  Jeopardy host Alex Trebek has announced that he has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  And I generally appreciated people praying for me with the heart attack that I had.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  And I know that he would appreciate your prayers as well.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  He says he plans to beat this low survival rate.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Statistics for this disease.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  He says he has to. He's got a contract for three more years.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  So we hope that he does.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  The odds are against him.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  All the celebrities that I've known that have come down with this disease have not survived.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Except for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  Allegedly, she has survived.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  But I need to know their good quality.

[19:57.000 --> 20:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  Welcome back.
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.000]  You know, I want to offer more than words of encouragement to Alex Trebek and other people
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  who have been diagnosed with cancer and have family members who are diagnosed with cancer.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  There's a story that's on Daily Mail, actually, it was a couple of days ago.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  And I'm surprised that this hasn't been picked up.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  There's a broader release here.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  They're talking about a patient in the U.K.
[20:48.000 --> 20:55.000]  and this has been released to a medical journal by the doctors who are treating him.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  He's 81 years old and he had refused chemo treatment.
[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  He had also refused any other treatments from the doctors after they diagnosed him with lung cancer.
[21:06.000 --> 21:12.000]  The only thing that he was willing to do was take a couple of drops of CBD oil each day.
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  And I mean, this is nothing special in terms of its concentration.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  I'm just going here from memory.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  I think it was something like 20 milligrams per milliliter or something like that.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  It's a pretty standard dosage for CBD oil.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  And he didn't take a whole lot of it.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  He took, again, going from memory, take a look at the article on Daily Mail.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  Striking scans show lung cancer patients' tumors shrink because of CBD oil.
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  He only did it for a couple of months and it shrunk significantly.
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  I'll give you the details here, but again, if you want to get the exact dosage of what he took,
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  20 milligrams per milliliter I think is what it was.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  I think he took like nine drops a day and then dropped it back to just two drops a day.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  And then after a couple of months he said, I don't like the way this tastes.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.000]  I'm going to quit.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  This guy is somebody who all of his life has struggled with respiratory diseases.
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  He had been diagnosed with a condition called COPD,
[22:14.000 --> 22:21.000]  which is a respiratory issue at a very young age, but he continued to smoke.
[22:21.000 --> 22:29.000]  And then, I guess it was back in 2016, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  And they said, well, I would like to do some chemotherapy.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  He said, no, I got to do that.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  I'm not going to do anything.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  So he took CBD oil.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  Now, when we look at this, and a lot of people don't understand the difference between CBD
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  and between regular marijuana that has THC.
[22:49.000 --> 22:58.000]  These are two substances that are part of the plant, but you can grow a plant,
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  even though the government as part of the UN War on Drugs had banned hemp plants,
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  which have a lot of uses anywhere from paper to textiles and so forth,
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  but also medicine, you can increase the CBD.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  You can selectively breed it to increase the THC.
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  The THC is the psychoactive component of that.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  But the CBD can be used for medical purposes.
[23:25.000 --> 23:32.000]  I find it very interesting that even as we have a bill coming out of the federal government,
[23:32.000 --> 23:40.000]  Mitch McConnell, there in Kentucky, along with Rand Paul, pushed for us to be able to grow hemp in the United States.
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  Hemp is something that these two used to make ropes, as I pointed out, textiles, many other things.
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  And we could buy hemp products from Canada, but we couldn't legally grow them here in the United States
[23:50.000 --> 23:58.000]  because they had put it, the United Nations had put it in their war on drugs, that Richard Nixon put into law 10 years later.
[23:58.000 --> 24:04.000]  And so they corrected that because it doesn't get anybody addicted, it doesn't get anybody high.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  And even though they did that, even though they did that at the federal level,
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  even though we've had two-thirds of the states legalize marijuana for medical purposes and so forth,
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  we now have places like New York City, even North Carolina,
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  that are starting to crack down on people putting CBD oil in restaurant products
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  or in coffee drinks or in smoothies or whatever.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  It's like, what is going on with this? Why do they hate it so much?
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Well, this may be the answer, folks.
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  You know, there's a lot of money to be made in cancer treatment, isn't there?
[24:39.000 --> 24:45.000]  This is a guy, again, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.000]  And even though he had that, this guy smoked 20 cigarettes a day in his 20s and 30s.
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  He's now 81, he was diagnosed with a lung adenocarcinoma in October 2016
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  when he went to the doctor and complained that his breathlessness was getting worse.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  It always been breathless, but it was getting worse.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  Scan showed that he had a tumor that was about 2.5 by 2.5 centimeters, which is about an inch by an inch.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  They showed that it also had spread to his lymph nodes.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  He went back, that was in October, he goes back in December of 2016,
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  and they see that it had increased in size.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  And then he goes back again in July of 2017, and it shows that his disease was slowly progressing.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  At that point, he began to take some CBD oil,
[25:34.000 --> 25:40.000]  and he had a CT scan in November that revealed a near total resolution of the mass,
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  according to the report that was filed in a medical journal.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  They said that this particular cancer that he had, this lung cancer that he had,
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  only about 15% of the patients survive for five years, according to statistics.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  And so when we look at this, they caution everybody that this is a single case.
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  This is a study of one person, but we've had a lot of testimonials from people throughout the years.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  They always say that, well, that's just one person.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  This is not a scientific study.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  Who's going to do that scientific study? Why don't they do that scientific study?
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  Good question. It's about time, I think, that they did.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  And it's about time that you stop having the government prohibit that from people,
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  especially when we look at the fact that the FDA has just identified certain food additives
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  that they say are carcinogenic.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  They've done animal studies, they're going to ban these, but they're not going to start doing it until 2020.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  They're going to do that, they're going to let the food manufacturers continue on with these additives,
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  because it's so important that they have things to preserve the food, to color the food,
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  to make it behave in a certain way in the manufacturing process.
[26:54.000 --> 27:01.000]  So they are going to continue to let them put these additives in that they think causes cancer.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  They're convinced enough that it causes cancer that they're going to ban it,
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  but they're going to allow the manufacturer of this to continue. What does that tell you?
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  What does that tell you about the actual concern that our government has for your health and safety?
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  That's why you have to be concerned about your health and safety.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  It said following pressure from several environmental and consumer safety groups, reports EcoWatch,
[27:25.000 --> 27:32.000]  the FDA in October of 2018 opted to ban seven synthetic food additives known to cause harm.
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  Things like benzo phenone, ethyl acrylate, pyridine, and styrene, things that you and I wouldn't know,
[27:40.000 --> 27:46.000]  because they typically don't even put them on the label. They just list them as artificial flavors.
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  But they're giving the companies 16 months to continue to use these things,
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  even though they say that to their satisfaction it has been proven to cause cancer in lab animals.
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  They'll still be putting it in your food for another 16 months, which brings us to vaccines again,
[28:05.000 --> 28:13.000]  because there is a epidemic of fear mongering that is going on in the mainstream media about vaccines everywhere you look.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  They're talking about these epidemics of measles, for example.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  Well, you know, we have a lot of additives that are put into vaccines,
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.000]  the same type of stuff that they put into these food products sometimes are used as preservatives.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  Sometimes are used as adjuvants to try to irritate your immune system.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  Do you know what those things are? Have you looked at the label? Do you realize what the risks are?
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  Should you be able to determine what those risks are?
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  Do you realize that there was just an outbreak of contaminated vaccines in three states in the United States?
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  One of them was Kentucky. Perhaps that's why Rand Paul went public about this
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  in spite of this epidemic of fear mongering that is coming out of the mainstream media. We'll be right back.

[33:24.000 --> 33:30.000]  And now your host, David Knight.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  Welcome back. I want to play, we talked about this yesterday,
[33:34.000 --> 33:41.000]  but I want to play Rand Paul talking about your right to not have mandatory vaccinations
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  for you or for your children.
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.000]  But I want to give you some context for this, because you may not be aware,
[33:47.000 --> 33:56.000]  I've only seen this reported in a couple of places, not mainstream media is not picking this up for the most part.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  It's just local media that's talking about the contaminated vaccines that were found in three states,
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, that are causing infections.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  It was reported by WKRC that a company called Location Vaccination
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  started providing vaccines for businesses in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, back in September.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  Shortly after that, some people started noticing swelling and lumps at the injection site.
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  Only after multiple people began complaining about infections did the health department step in,
[34:29.000 --> 34:35.000]  realized that the vaccines had been contaminated, they'd been improperly stored.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  And so they cautioned people that symptoms can show up up to three months after getting the shot.
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  Now, I think that that has something to do with the fact that Rand Paul came out and said,
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  we need to understand that there are risks involved and people need to be able to make their decisions.
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  And we also need to understand, as I was just talking about in the last segment,
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  the FDA coming out and saying, we're going to ban certain food additives that we've identified
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  that we think that we're convinced cause cancer.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  And so we're going to ban these, but we're going to let the companies continue to sell them for another 16 months.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  Can you distinguish between the difference between food and additives?
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  Do you understand there's a difference between food and food coloring?
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  Do you understand there's a difference between food and preservatives that they might put in the food?
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  Of course you do.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  But do you understand the difference when it comes to vaccines?
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  Because with vaccines, as soon as you start talking about preservatives and additives and adjuvants and so forth,
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  everybody freaks out and says, shut up, you're a stupid anti-vaxxer.
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  No, I understand the difference, just like I understand the difference between food and food additives.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  I understand the difference between vaccines and vaccine additives.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  And you should understand the difference as well.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  And when we talk about the people who are getting infections from these improperly stored vaccinations,
[36:00.000 --> 36:07.000]  there was a story that I broke, I didn't break it, actually I talked about it.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  I say broke it because nobody else really talks about this kind of stuff in the mainstream media.
[36:12.000 --> 36:21.000]  You may not be aware that last July in Samoa, two children died immediately after they got MMR vaccines.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  It was a tragic story.
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.000]  Mother was there with their young toddlers, one kid gets a vaccine, dies immediately, everybody freaks out.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  Mother who was waiting to get her child a shot says, no thanks, I don't want that.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  And they basically forced her to have that vaccine against her wishes and she watched her child immediately die.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  Now, there was, as you can imagine, a great deal of concern in Samoa.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  But the article wasn't covered very far outside of Samoa.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  There were some New Zealand papers that picked it up, but outside of that, outside of the vaccine awareness movement,
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  not too many people talked about this.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  And what they did was they did not go after the vaccine companies.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  They did not go after the hospital.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  They went after the nurses that administered the vaccine.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  They became the ones who were the scapegoats in that.
[37:17.000 --> 37:24.000]  And they said that it was because these things were improperly stored, that they were past their expiration date.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  There's another risk that they don't like to talk about.
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  You know, we can talk about the adjuvants there that are designed to irritate your immune system,
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.000]  to try to help it to respond to what they've just injected to make sure that you get immunity.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  They do that because they were having difficulty conveying immunity, so they put irritants in there.
[37:42.000 --> 37:51.000]  Do those irritants cause certain long-lasting lifetime conditions in some people that are exposed to that?
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  I believe they do.
[37:53.000 --> 38:01.000]  But it's ultimately up to you because your informed consent should be important to the government,
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  but it isn't to most people.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  It is to Rand Paul.
[38:03.000 --> 38:11.000]  Here's what he had to say, and then I'm going to play the rebuttal from another senator, a Republican also.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  Cassidy.
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Because out there saying, well, if you believe in liberty, that's fine.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  Don't get immunized.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  But I don't think you have the right to expose other people to the disease.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  Well, then you don't have any liberty at all.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  You know, the first thing is, we can talk about whether or not a particular medicine is effective.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  But the first thing should be, is it safe?
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  They used to be part of medical ethics.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  Going all the way back to the Greek physician Galen, who said, first, do no harm.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  That should still apply.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  And we should have physicians who advise us of the risks because every course of action or even inaction carries its own risk.
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  And then ultimately, we should be able to decide, just like that guy who said, no, I don't want chemotherapy.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  No, I don't want radiation or surgery.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  I will try CBD for a little bit.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  And then it worked.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  But he also should have the right to refuse all treatment.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  Don't you think?
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  Are we pro-choice?
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  Oh, not unless you're talking about killing babies.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  Here's what Rand Paul had to say about forcing vaccinations.
[39:15.000 --> 39:23.000]  I'm not a fan of government coercion, yet given the choice, I do believe that the benefits of most vaccines vastly outweigh the risks.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  Yet it is wrong to say that there are no risks to vaccines.
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  Even the government admits that children are sometimes injured by vaccines.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  Since 1988, over $4 billion has been paid out from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Despite the government admitting to and paying $4 billion for vaccine injuries,
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  no informed consent is used or required when you vaccinate your child.
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  This may be the only medical procedure in today's medical world where an informed consent is not required.
[39:52.000 --> 40:03.000]  Now, proponents of mandatory government vaccination argue that parents who refuse to vaccinate their children risk spreading these disease to the immunocompromised community.
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.000]  There doesn't seem to be enough evidence of this happening to be recorded as a statistic, but it could happen.
[40:09.000 --> 40:16.000]  But if the fear of this is valid, are we to find that next will be mandating flu vaccines?
[40:16.000 --> 40:22.000]  Between 12,000 and 56,000 people die from the flu, or are said to die from the flu in America,
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  and there's estimated to be a few hundred from measles.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  So I would guess that those who want to mandate measles will be after us on the flu next.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  Yet the current science only allows for educated guessing when it comes to the flu vaccine.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  Each year, before that year's flu vaccine or strain is known, the scientists put their best guess into that year's vaccine.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  Some years it's completely wrong.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  We vaccinate for the wrong strain of flu vaccine.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  Yet five states already mandate flu vaccines.
[40:52.000 --> 41:00.000]  Is it really appropriate to mandate a vaccine that more often than not vaccinate for the wrong flu strain?
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  As we contemplate forcing parents to choose this or that vaccine,
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  I think it's important to remember that force is not consistent with the American story,
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.000]  nor is force consistent with the liberty our forefathers sought when they came to America.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  I don't think you have to have one or the other though.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  I'm not here to say don't vaccinate your kids. If this appearing is for persuasion, I'm all for the persuasion.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  I vaccinated myself. I vaccinated my kids.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  For myself and my children, I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  But I still do not favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  That's always the exchange, isn't it?
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  Give me your freedom for a promise of security.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  That's what we've done with the Patriot Act. That's what we've done with the TSA.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  You know, I just had a story of a guy that got caught by the TSA
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  trying to bring a RPG, a rocket-propelled grenade, on board a plane.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  And I told my wife, she said, look at this.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  I said, it doesn't surprise me as much that a guy would try to bring an RPG on a plane
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  as it does that the TSA would be able to find it because they fail on all these different aspects.
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  But the biggest failure is the failure of the American people to fall for that false promise.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  You've made that fousty and bargain with them over and over again.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  You never get freedom when you give up your liberty.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  Our people in prisons, they're completely secure, aren't they?
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  But they don't have any liberty. Do we think that if we can lock everybody up in prison,
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  if we live in a police state, in a prison state, that that's preferable to a state of liberty,
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  liberty comes with risks and form us of the risk?
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  Quite frankly, we look at Cassidy. I don't think that he believes that these vaccines are effective
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  because he's so worried about being exposed to measles.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  You'll get real immunity if you get measles. I know I had it. Everybody in my generation did as children.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  Some people have some bad side effects of it, but that happens with anything. It's part of risks.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[43:04.000 --> 43:12.000]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[43:12.000 --> 43:20.000]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[43:35.000 --> 43:42.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us,
[43:52.000 --> 43:59.000]  and the 360 win, we're dead in the water, I'm in your hands, you're in my hands. InfoWarsStore.com, thank you.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can't food.
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.000]  During the falls, they have it during the winter.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.

[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  What is the top tumor that's a best-seller because it's anti-inflammatory, and what's the best lab in the country?
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  Okay, they're the highest rate. I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  I'm like, what's the hottest you could do a month later?
[46:30.000 --> 46:36.000]  90, 95%. No one's ever done it. I said, how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10? No one's ever done that.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  Sir, the average competitor is 3% to 5%. The top brand is 50%.
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.000]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid. I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information is explosive?
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  Our fish oil. I go out and I get the cleanest, the best. My children take it.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers? Never!

[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  and over here you do the real thing, and it appeared to have worked certainly in Alabama
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.120]  and other places. We're talking during the break about how the Internet is becoming really
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:08.840]  a corporate town. And when we were taken off back in August of last year, started looking
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.280]  at this, and I think there's a very relevant Supreme Court case as a lawyer. I'd like to
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:16.600]  get your First Amendment lawyer. I'd like to get your take on it. Marsh versus Alabama,
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:23.160]  1946, you had a situation as a corporate town. The corporation owned the entire town, and
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.600]  they had a Jehovah's Witness come through with a literature wanting to put it out. The corporation
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.160]  doesn't like that literature, just like they don't like conservatives today in Silicon
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.920]  Valley, so they said, no, you can't do that. She fought them all the way to Supreme Court.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.520]  The Supreme Court said, even if the corporation owns the public square, they can't stop
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.800]  free speech. And I think that's a relevant situation. I'm surprised that more people
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.280]  are not talking about that in the context of this, because I really do think that we've
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:54.520]  allowed Silicon Valley to become the corporate owners of the Internet and controlling speech
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.800]  in exactly the same way. You've had Jack Dorsey has said at least eight times in public that
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.960]  their business model is the public square. Absolutely. And so if you look at it, the
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:11.880]  history of that case came in the context of coal mining towns doing this. So big coal
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.560]  mining companies decided, well, they didn't want people getting all agitated and unionized
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:20.000]  and are doing nothing else, especially when a whole bunch of folks maybe die in an accident.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.920]  So they decided, well, we're just going to own the whole town. And if we own the whole
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:28.520]  town, we can control law enforcement, we can control speech, we can control political activity,
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.840]  we can control petitioning activity, we can control union organizing, we can control all
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.320]  of it. And so that was the context in which that Alabama case, though it was a different
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.160]  case, came up to the Supreme Court. And of course, it was made famous in the song by
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:45.040]  Tennessee Ernie Ford. I load 16 tons of what I get another day older and deeper in debt
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.600]  to the company store, right? Exactly. Everything to the company store. Precisely, that whole
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.400]  background. Johnny Cash saying you once got arrested for picking daisies. So he was a
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.120]  certain mindset mentality, those kind of company towns in the Supreme Court is like, we're
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.800]  not going to allow this to be an exception to the First Amendment. You can't privatize
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.440]  and monopolize the public square. And those are the two components, the privatization
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.560]  of the public square and the monopolization of the public square. And yeah, that's where
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.520]  we are today. That's exactly what they've created. That's their model that they've created
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.640]  as soon as you go back to the creation of the Internet. It was originally put out by
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:19.480]  a DARPA psychologist talking about the intergalactic computer network. They shortened it to Internet.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.600]  He was a psychologist. He wanted to control people. He wanted to control the narrative.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.440]  He wanted to control what the public thought. And when it became practical, that was back
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.080]  in the 1960s. When it became practical in the 1990s, you see all these people from DARPA
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:36.440]  getting on the boards of all these venture capital firms that are picking and funding
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.040]  the companies that now control the Internet. You had the CIA openly create their own venture
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:46.480]  capital firm, Incutel. And so we know where this is coming from. And we know that these
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.560]  people are simply a glove, a private glove for this iron fist of control.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:57.200]  Precisely. So like in California, where almost all these big tech companies are located,
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.640]  they extended the doctrine to even malls. And it's called a prunyard doctrine in California.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.840]  And they said a private mall could not ban public petitioners because the private mall
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.840]  was a de facto public square. And so they extended that doctrine of the corporate town
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:16.080]  to even malls. Now the U.S. Supreme Court did not do that, but the California Supreme
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.400]  Court did. And that's where all of these big tech giants are. So I brought one of the first
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.040]  cases against Twitter in California, establishing that it applied to Twitter. The court agreed
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.720]  it did apply to Twitter and then found different factual grounds in that particular case to
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:34.160]  evade getting further into the issue. Really? And Twitter instead settled the case on very
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.880]  favorable terms to my client in that instance. To keep that from being established. Exactly.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.680]  To go up to the appellate court, to go up to the California Supreme Court. So it definitely
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.560]  needs to be articulated and advocated that there is a free market, but the free market
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.720]  is derivative of rights to property and other things in the Constitution. Free speech and
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.680]  free expression and free press are the only things that are specifically articulated because
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.160]  there is no free market if you have no free speech. There is no free market if you don't
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.160]  have free press. And particularly the independent press, the citizen press, not the government
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.160]  controlled press, not the corporate controlled press, which is in bed with the government
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.560]  narrative. I mean, when's the last time you ever saw a mainstream big corporate media
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.320]  institution challenge a war narrative? Yeah, exactly. And that's what makes it so insidious.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.880]  As I pointed out many times, we're not just talking about their ability to shut down a
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.760]  press organization like Info Wars. We're talking about them going after the speech of individual
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.680]  citizens who are, first of all, not allowed because they shut down the free press or not
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.920]  allowed to see and hear certain things, but they're not allowed to give their comments
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:41.780]  about what they think about a particular issue. That's the extension of this that we've never
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:46.840]  seen that kind of oppression before. Precisely. The Trump election was a wake up sign to the
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.160]  big tech giants that ordinary people could use their power, particularly through something
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.080]  like Info Wars by supporting Info Wars, sharing Info Wars, expressing it, putting it on social
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.080]  media, backing it in multiple ways, making it independent. I mean, this is one of the
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.280]  only media organizations in the world that's independent of big corporate donations. That's
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.240]  right. That's independent of course. Yeah, right. They could they they can't work boycotts
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.800]  against us. So they just came out and shut us down using these owners of the Internet.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.040]  Exactly. So I mean, they had to ultimately say this audience is so scary and their ability
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.320]  to act on the information provided by Info Wars that we have to keep the audience from
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.240]  even hearing the ideas expressed by Info Wars. And now they're even going to the point where
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.440]  they're trying to suppress the voices of the audience when they're acting in their own individual
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.160]  capacity, whether they're crowdfunding, whether they're active on social media, no matter
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.440]  which way they're doing it. And so that shows the power and the success of this. But it
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.840]  also shows the threat that Info Wars and the public faces that if the if this free speech
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:50.440]  and free press is to be maintained and sustained against the against this Chinese state censorship
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.640]  private public co-option model, then it's going to be up to the ordinary people in the
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.120]  audience to do so. And they can use these terms like we're going to steer it. We're going
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.160]  to nudge it. That was a big thing a couple of years ago. They're talking about nudging,
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.840]  you know, the people in the Obama administration. It's Orwellian Newspeak. It's like that.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.400]  Orwell forecast all this. Let's talk about, of course, you know, whenever we talk about
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:14.920]  this juncture, whenever I bring this up on social media, I get people pushed back. But
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:20.920]  what about you support the freedom of this baker in Colorado to say, Well, I'm not going
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.080]  to make a custom cake for somebody. He's not throwing them. First of all, he's not throwing
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.640]  them out of his business. They can buy anything off the shelf that they want. But he's saying,
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.720]  Oh, I'm not going to do a custom thing for you because that violates my religious freedom.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.840]  And of course, the Supreme Court agreed with him. But that's a very different thing because
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.720]  his model is not the town square like these other corporations are. That's totally a
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.880]  different issue, isn't it? Absolutely, because it's different. It's making sure it's equal.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.000]  So really what's happening is they want to create an unequal equation. So they want the
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.040]  independent press, the little guy to be suppressed and not have the same free press and free
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.840]  speech rights that the big powerful corporate media has. That's why they're using defamation
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.440]  law in disparate ways. Big established media can do whatever they want, say whatever they
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.000]  can smear a bunch of kids in Covington and get away with it without any consequence.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.560]  Now there's going to be consequence because we're going to sue, but they're going to be
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.680]  begging those courts to say, Hey, we're big media. We should be protected. Well, none
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.720]  of those same protections are being extended to Alex Jones and in for why? Because the
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.040]  independent press, they want there to be a double standard. It's like there's a double
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.440]  standard in our criminal justice system between what happened with people who are allied with
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.640]  Trump versus people who versus Hillary and her crew. The same thing is happening in the
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.880]  first amendment context, the free press context, the free speech context. They want to make
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.040]  it an unequal equation. So there's only one audience, only one microphone, only one voice
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.760]  that can be heard in the public. All right, we're going to take a quick break and we'll
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:48.320]  be right back with Robert Barnes. Very interesting. You find him at Barnes Law LLP.com. Thank

[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:13.840]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support.

[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:39.560]  Welcome back. We're talking to Robert Barnes, BarnesLawLLP.com. We're talking about First
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:44.960]  Amendment issues folks and it is a first priority. We don't have free speech. If the government
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.080]  is going to control that, that's the beginning of the end. They can control everything. They
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.960]  can control the narrative. They can control your behavior. When we combine this desire
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.800]  to control our speech, what we hear, what we know, what we think we know, along with
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:04.320]  their intention, as we've seen already, how they're working this out, the beta test that
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.440]  they've got going by Google and others being done for the Chinese Communist government
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.000]  when they have biometric data on all of their citizens and that's why they're rolling out
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.360]  this 5G because they need to have that bandwidth in order to be able to do complete, dragnet
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.480]  surveillance of every activity that we do. They say, well, you're going to have your
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:26.080]  Internet of Things. You're going to have your self-driving cars and so forth which they
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.320]  will be driving. We will not be driving. They will be driving. You will not be driving
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.320]  yourself. They'll be driving you. They'll be taxing and tracking your every movement
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:39.480]  and they have to have this massive bandwidth in order to be able to put in the kind of
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:47.320]  controls that they want. But I want to go for a moment to the Joe Rogan, Jack Dorsey,
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.440]  Michael Forte, Tim Poole, interviewing them. I think it's very important when we look at
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:35:00.640]  how they made the case, how the lawyer made the phony case for Alex. I was just astounded.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.480]  First of all, when you see that clip that they tried to demonize Alex with about saying,
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.720]  well, look at this. He shoved a kid down. That's obvious to anybody that takes even
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.120]  a cursory glance at that, but that's not Alex Jones. I thought it was one of the most dishonest
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.440]  and dirty tricks I've ever seen for the mainstream media. Organizations like the Wall Street
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:25.240]  Journal who have been at the forefront of demonizing Roger Stone, a lot of people that
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:30.560]  are Trump supporters. And of course, we understand that they've got a globalist agenda there
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.360]  at the Wall Street Journal, but they have been at the forefront of phony attacks like
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.960]  this. And they were the ones pushing out this idea that that was Alex Jones dominating
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.320]  this. And the lawyer read that show. I've got three things here. And that was the first
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320]  one that you mentioned, Robert.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:48.040]  Exactly. I mean, it showed the degree to which it wasn't serious or sincere that she identified
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.800]  something that was just sort of a comedic meme about the nature of reactions and reactions.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.560]  And when you contrast that, what exposes their course of conduct is their inconsistency, their
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:02.800]  hypocrisy and duplicity. So when you look at a situation like there are Hollywood movie
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:09.360]  directors who showed the Covington kids being put through a shredder and being just being
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.160]  wiped out, there was I don't think there was a single strike issued to him. So somehow
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:22.800]  that's the Ray Zaslan still has his post up that says, isn't this such a punchable face?
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.600]  And yet, and then they've taken no action. So here there's a meme that has nothing that
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.840]  Alex Jones is not in at all. That's just about how the left attacks people and then
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:36.360]  when anybody pushes back, it just dramatizes that they start screaming and say, oh, that's
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.160]  somehow is encouraging and incentivizing something bad. Whereas people who explicitly
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.560]  say, please punch this person, let's put this, let's put all these minor kids through a shredder
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.400]  and kill them. Oh, that's just fine. Yeah, because it's Covington kids and it's on the
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.800]  left. So Twitter's hypocrisy and duplicity and double standards and their deceptiveness
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.840]  show that their motivation is to put their hand on the lever of one side against the
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.360]  other not to be equal enforcers of a set of rules. That's what they're talking about putting
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.840]  their hand on one side of the other. They can allow Oliver Darcy that the second one
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:12.480]  was Oliver Darcy. Here's a guy who is not a journalist. He is a censor. His mission
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:19.080]  in life is to deep platform and to, you know, wishing of the cornfield anybody that he doesn't
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:24.160]  agree with instead of debating them. I mean, that's what a journalist is supposed to do.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.240]  You're supposed to, you know, record the facts or if you are into analysis and commentary,
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:34.840]  the people that you don't agree with. But when Alex confronts him or when Laura Loomer
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:39.880]  did it at CPAC, that was really disgusting that CPAC would do the same thing over the
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:46.200]  same guy, this Oliver Darcy, this passive aggressive censor that works for CNN. And
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:50.800]  that was number two in terms of talking about shutting down Alex. You talk about, you know,
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:56.760]  favoring one side versus the other. He can slander Alex Jones. He can try to deep platform
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.840]  and successfully do it anytime he fingers somebody. They immediately do something about
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.680]  it. And then when Alex confronts him, shut him down.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.560]  Exactly. I mean, it's extraordinary that a public confrontation at a public place that's
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:14.320]  entirely nonviolent, that's entirely about speech between two people that are public,
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:19.520]  publicly identified figures is somehow subject to censorship. I mean, it doesn't make sense.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.720]  It's not, and it's something that happens routinely on Twitter on the left. I mean,
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:29.240]  you had Antifa sitting outside the deplorable with the sponsored here by Mike Cernovich and
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:35.040]  others, you know, chanting, throwing batteries at people and demanding that they send out
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.760]  Cernovich over and over again. They had to have a bunch of police there. They attacked
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.240]  people at one of those events in New York. Twitter didn't do anything about that. Twitter
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.680]  still has all the Antifa accounts up and running. Twitter still has a lot, almost all
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.400]  of those accounts that have one reason why Fox decided to basically refuse to use Twitter
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.360]  for months is because Twitter refused to take down the accounts that Docs Tucker Carlson
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:59.680]  that led to Antifa banging on the door and videotaping it while his wife was terrified
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:04.280]  inside. Yeah. So actual violence, they do nothing about actual threats of violence.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.040]  They do nothing about but free speech in a public space between two public figures about
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.080]  access to free speech. Oh, that's so terrible. We have to permanently ban Alex Jones from
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.940]  ever being able to use Twitter again. And then when Alex talks in an allegorical way
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:22.640]  about, you know, using war analogies, you know, newsflash here were called info wars.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.720]  It is an information war. Hillary Clinton has said that she has an information war.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.520]  We're losing it. You know, one of the things that I've talked about frequently is going
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:38.120]  back to November of 2017, they had Senate hearings. And after all the big profile people
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:43.520]  left, they had a guy's name is Clint Watts and he's a retired military. He's worked
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:47.240]  for the FBI has got another organization comes in and he starts using all of these military
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:52.400]  analogies saying this is an information war and so forth. He said we have to silence the
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:58.000]  guns on the battlefield. And that means that we shut down social media. Okay. And so he's
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.560]  talking about, you know, taking out the cannons, silencing the guns. It is a civil war. We've
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.000]  got to make sure that we win this civil war. And we're going to so he's using all those
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.360]  allegorical issues. Now, when Alex does that, they take it out of context, they say, well,
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.960]  he means that literally. And then they use that that was their number three, their third
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.960]  strike.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.080]  It was absurd. It was language that is used every day in the public arena. Yeah. And it
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.240]  was nothing nearly as extreme as some of the things Obama has said. Some of the things
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.800]  Biden has said, same as some of the things that Clinton's have said. I mean, they use
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.040]  much more grotesque language and have a much bigger platform and actually have political
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:37.960]  state power behind them. So the so somehow all of that they Twitter and social media
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.520]  had no problem with any of that. But if Alex Jones just uses the same language that they
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:48.560]  use, or an often nowhere nearly as as dramatic language as they use, all of a sudden, that's
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.160]  a terrible horrible thing. It's so self evidently discriminatory that the only people who didn't
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.520]  realize it would be seen for what it is, is the Twitter world itself. They live in their
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:01.680]  own little bubbles so much that they thought, Oh, nobody's going to realize we're discriminating.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.880]  We can just go out there and say, we have no idea what's going on here. Here's a good
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:10.040]  example of that. And the back and forth between Rogan and this lawyer, is their name pronounced
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.680]  Gatti, is that it? Rogan says, it's a really important thing to go over all the nuances
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:19.280]  of a particular subject. And he's talking about protected classes and gender and anything.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.760]  He says, we need to go over the nuances of this because I think that one in particular
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:28.720]  highlights this idea where the problems lie in having a protected class. The lawyer for
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:34.200]  Twitter says, we have a lot of protected classes. We have gender, race, nationality. And Rogan
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.880]  says, but not for white people. When you say gender or race, and then Gatti says, well,
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:46.320]  it protects all protected categories. She doesn't even realize that if we protect all
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.840]  protected categories, we will define what is H speech, and we will define what is protected
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.520]  and we will protect these particular things. And like we're saying off break, it's like,
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.520]  or well, you know, some animals are more equal than others and some classes are more protected
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.520]  than others. Some get absolutely no protection at all, right? Absolutely. She didn't realize
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.560]  that the way the law is structured for protected classes, it doesn't discriminate based on
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.680]  whether or not you vote Democrat or not. So it's not like though it's you know, our minority
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.200]  coalition, that's what they mean by protected. No, they mean everybody's protected. That's
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.320]  who the law protects. The law doesn't say only people within these categories are protected.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.840]  It says he can't discriminate on the basis of race, period, can't discriminate on the
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.880]  basis of gender, period, can't discriminate on the basis of religion or political viewpoint,
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.720]  period, in a wide range of places. And the fact that they didn't realize it showed how
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:35.240]  much they live in their own bubble, and didn't realize that their own lives would be seen
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:40.000]  as their own lives to the world when exposed by a liberal leftist guy like Tim Bull, who
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.640]  now they're calling a Nazi because he challenged Twitter. Yeah, a guy who made his market occupy.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.400]  You know, it's like, that's amazing. But you know, it shows how important it is to have
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.440]  independent journalists who are not captive. All right. Thank you so much for joining us,
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.240]  Robert Barnes, Robert Barnes Law LLP.com.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.880]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners. This was
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.000]  going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore. It's
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.320]  been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:13.120]  source, the best atomic iodide in the world, X2 is back. We got it. This deal just happened
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.360]  about a month ago. We rushed it into production. It's been bottled. The labels are being put
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.760]  on today and that it's going to be on an 18 wheeler right here to Austin from the plant
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.000]  in the Rockies. And it's going to be shipped out to you. Be sure and sign up for auto ship
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.400]  and an additional 10% off the 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.520]  relaunching it. Research the iodine conspiracy. Find out why it's so important. Find out why
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.840]  the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens. You have the bad halogens at
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:48.000]  infowarstore.com. That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com. They should write the supplements.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:57.040]  And this is the King Daddy. Ladies and gentlemen, it is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.120]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.880]  be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:10.040]  be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.400]  teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age,
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.240]  your words going forever, but now they're even better getting rid of what you said
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:21.240]  and they were before. It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.520]  we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.800]  I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.640]  know the truth and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:40.600]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.320]  that transcends space and time. When you commit, be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:50.600]  spread our articles and videos. That overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:55.320]  commit to support InfoWars however you can and realize your provision to InfoWars is
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.360]  your own provision.
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:02.400]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.640]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.740]  It literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:19.080]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:22.400]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.360]  supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and Brought
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:32.320]  UX2 that's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.160]  more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists,
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.960]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:51.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.200]  and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:24.200]  Here's three now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:29.160]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:34.240]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:40.120]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.680]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.160]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to. The bare minimum you can do
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:56.480]  is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:26.320]  and we are winning.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:38.000]  Welcome back. We're going to talk about the Marvel Matriarchy. We're going to marvel
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.760]  at that and we're going to marvel at transhumanism that is being sold to you. I imagine it's
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:50.160]  pretty blatant and pretty obvious, the Matriarchy. We've actually got writers now who play some
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.880]  of these superheroes. They're not real superheroes, they just play them in Hollywood. But they
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:02.440]  are lecturing us on the fact that we have to have women controlling the society. That's
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.360]  the only way that we're going to be able to move forward. And they are very, very obvious
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.160]  in what they are pushing at the movies. But we're going to talk about that and we're going
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:17.560]  to talk about the less obvious agenda behind all of this as well. Because today we have
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:26.120]  the release of a new movie, Captain Marvel. It's amazing what they are doing with this,
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:31.080]  how it is being protected. We're talking about different protected classes in social media.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.480]  Well you've got not only protected classes and certain types of people that are protected
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:41.080]  and others that are attacked with immunity. But you also have protected movies. Take a
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:45.720]  look at this screenshot here guys. Zoom in on this. This is Flickster. And as you can
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:48.920]  see here, when I look at the movies that are coming out this week, the first one that shows
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:54.480]  up is Captain Marvel. And you notice that there's absolutely nothing there. They say
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:59.000]  no score yet. And yet, when you look at all the rest of these films that are coming out,
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.560]  Apollo 11, a Chinese foreign film and on and on, you can see that they have ratings there
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:11.200]  of critics. They have ratings of people, whether they want to see it or not, what they think
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:17.520]  about this. They've always done that on Flickster. Now they're saying and Rotten Tomatoes. Now
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.520]  they're saying, oh, we're not going to do that for Captain Marvel. That tells you right
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:26.720]  there. There's always a warning sign when they hide the critical reviews in advance.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.480]  But we've got a critical review coming up as to what is in that. Before we do real quickly,
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.480]  I want to talk about some of the products that we sell at infowarstore.com. Because as
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:40.280]  Robert Barnes and I were just saying, we set up something here that was not dependent
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:46.080]  on sponsors to try to be independent of boycotts so that we could speak freely and tell you
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.240]  what we think. You don't have to agree with us. I mean, we're going to give you our honest
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:52.400]  analysis. You're free to agree or disagree. We're not going to try to control that, but
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:58.240]  they are trying to control it. And so we set up infowarstore.com to sell products directly
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.120]  to you. You can make up your mind. You can take control of your health. You still have
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.640]  that opportunity. We've got Republicans who are trying to take away that freedom of choice
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:12.520]  as well as Democrats trying to mandate vaccines and other things. But you still can choose
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.800]  as to what you're going to do to try to help your health to provide for your health and
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.600]  for your family's health. Some of the products that we've got right now on sale, we've got
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:28.800]  DNA Force Plus, which was out of stock. We've now got that back in stock and it is 33% off.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:34.360]  And that is a huge dollar savings because that's a very expensive product to produce.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:41.200]  It has a very rare and unusual ingredient, PQQ, which helps to protect the telomeres.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.320]  We've talked about that many times on your DNA. That's something that is a biological
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:51.040]  clock. It is something that gradually degrades over a period of time. That helps to protect
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.080]  it from degrading. And it's got a lot of other ingredients. Take a look at what we have at
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:02.160]  infowarstore.com. Do your own research. We're confident that you're going to see the value
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:06.560]  of these different ingredients here. And I'm sure that you're going to see the value as
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.880]  you take these supplements. That's 33% off. It's a big dollar savings. We also have for
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:17.840]  limited time, we have 50% off of infowar select storeable food. This is made in America. It
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:23.680]  is non-GMO. You can store it for up to 25 years, even if you don't need it for an emergency,
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:29.120]  a natural emergency, or a man-made emergency. Even if you don't need it, it can help you
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:36.960]  to keep a, to budget your food, to protect you against food price increases. I'm sure
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.200]  that food is going to increase sometime in the next 25 years. Right now, you can get
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:46.200]  it at 50% off the regular price at infowarstore.com. And finally, we have bodies. You can get
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:52.480]  at 50% off. It is the ultimate turmeric formula. It's got a lot of natural ingredients, but
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.800]  turmeric, for example, especially when you pair it with black pepper and other natural
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.440]  ingredients, it really helps with joint support, with mobility support. It helps to fight
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:07.720]  inflammation, not just in your joints either. So take a look at bodies. It is now 50% off
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.320]  at infowarstore.com. And again, everything that you buy there helps to support free speech
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:18.360]  as well as your health. All right. So Marvel is coming up. As I said, they're very desperate
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.520]  to have a big opening weekend. So desperate, as a matter of fact, that they have pulled
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:30.040]  Stanley back from the dead to promote this movie. Now, Stanley does have a cameo appearance
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:35.880]  in this that they had filmed before he died. He died last November, but they were not going
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:42.300]  to let his Twitter account go to waste as a RT points out. It's got 3.6 million followers.
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:49.880]  So while they typically use this Twitter account to have respectful retrospections of his life
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:57.480]  and work, they went full on to hawk this movie. That's how concerned they are. Captain Marvel
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:02.080]  says Stanley from the dead. Captain Marvel landed in Hollywood this past Monday for
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:06.520]  the movie's premiere. Of course, you will not read any of those reviews, will you? They
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:11.280]  have been embargoed. Read about it more in the evening. Read about the evening more below.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:15.760]  And they have a tweet there where they talk about his movie premiere. Some of the people
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:20.800]  on Twitter came back and said, I hope that when I'm dead, my corporate owners don't
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:27.360]  do a weekend at Bernie's with my corpse to show their products. Another one said, I'm,
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:32.160]  I love you, Stan, but I'm unfollowing you because they are necromancing your account
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.240]  and your goodwill in order to market this film. It's cool when you went full salesman
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:42.080]  on your Stan Lee brand when you were alive. But now it's just a corporation putting strings
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:48.680]  on a corpse and making it dance around. You deserve better. Another one, picture Stanley,
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:53.240]  don't make me come down there. Well, what is it that people are concerned about with
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:58.120]  with Captain Marvel? Why are, why is the studio concerned that people aren't going to go?
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:03.360]  It may have something to do with the outspoken feminism that is being bandied about by the
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:10.640]  star of the film, Brie Larson. She has proclaimed the film to be about intersectional feminism.
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:17.200]  I guess that is the newest social justice league warrior insanity. I don't know what
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:20.920]  that is. I don't really care what that is. If you want to know what intersectional feminism
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:26.360]  is, go see the film. I won't be going. If you don't want that sold to your kids, maybe
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:32.200]  you won't take them either. She said it's 2019 and what 2019 is about really is intersectional
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:37.480]  feminism. There you go. I didn't know that. What 2019 is about.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:42.560]  Anyway, she says, they said some critics, these are some of the critical reviews that
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:48.000]  you're not allowed to see on Rotten Tomatoes or Flickster, whatever. Captain Marvel, some
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:54.120]  of them said, is a mundane film marked by unimaginative plotting, a generic superhero
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.920]  film. We're getting a lot of those lately. I think we've kind of reached a peak genre
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.800]  with this. A film that does not approach the ranks of top tier Marvel movies, said another
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.280]  one. Many have called it a grim film where no one seems to be having much fun, especially
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:13.600]  in the previews. Look at the previews. Look at how Samuel L. Jackson and the character
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:21.800]  he plays, Nick Fury, who doesn't really show too much fury, doesn't show too much backbone
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:27.200]  either. He looks very, very calm, not furious, and he looks totally dominated by this woman.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:32.200]  He's like, it's a retrospect. So I guess this is where he's starting to get his backbone.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:38.160]  He doesn't have one yet. James Woods, I think, summarized it best. He said, maybe America
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:43.880]  should pick a movie where the studio doesn't hate half of its audience. So there's a hashtag
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:49.320]  out there. Hashtag Alita Challenge. Now, why that? I talked about this about two and a
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:56.600]  half weeks ago. I talked about the film Alita, which did extremely poorly. Alita had not
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:03.920]  just a female lead, but a female robot lead. And I said, if you don't understand what that
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.560]  is about, there's a subcurrent here that is far more dangerous, I think, than the obvious
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:15.080]  one about feminism here. And I'd say dangerous in the sense that they want the two sexes
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:20.520]  to war against each other. That they only want to make men like Nick Fury look passive,
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:26.120]  look stupid, be dominated by women. That is one problem, you know, creating this animosity
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.880]  between different sexes just as they've done between different races. But there's also
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:39.200]  a transhumanism subtext to these superhero films. And, you know, when you look at what
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.300]  is really being told to us, I think we have to understand, and I think it's helpful to
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:48.800]  go back to what people have talked about in terms of mythology. I'll tell you what Joseph
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.320]  Campbell said, and then I'll tell you what C.S. Lewis said about mythology from a Christian
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:58.680]  perspective. Joseph Campbell, and you probably remember this NPR did a long series about
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:03.000]  the power of myth. One of the things that he said was mythology provides a cultural
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.800]  framework for society to educate the young. Well, where are children getting this cultural
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.240]  framework of mythology? Well, they're getting it in the schools, they're getting it especially
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:18.240]  from Hollywood. It is a worldview of secular humanism. That quite frankly, folks, if you
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:23.920]  don't understand it, that is the religion of the schools. And I'll have more on this
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.080]  when we come back. I'm going to tell you the difference between secular humanist myths
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:35.960]  and the difference between Christian myths. And it's a very significant difference. But
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:43.840]  they want you to look at their superheroes as the answer to life and death. You know,
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:49.000]  Buddhism by itself doesn't offer any hope. You know, the worst part about getting old,
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.040]  and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't be there for my children someday. That's why
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:57.160]  I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my children. Now I can make them
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:01.880]  strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned. But not once
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.800]  I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.400]  even better, getting rid of what you said and they were before. It's so much easier
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:13.240]  to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:19.280]  But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:22.760]  I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:28.560]  either. As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:33.520]  it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time. When you commit,
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.120]  be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.840]  everything the enemy's doing. So please now, commit to support info wars, however you
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:49.840]  can, and realize your provision to info wars is your own provision.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:23.640]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:29.000]  and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else like it, you must experience it. It is
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.080]  a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice or
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:38.920]  water, whatever you'd like. Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours,
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:43.000]  so take a half pack at the first time you take it, because turbo force is named turbo force,
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  because it will take you into overdrive. Turbo force, and enforce live.com.
[01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:13.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back, let's talk about the pulp fiction of
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:19.640]  our time, and of course the dominant genre right now, of course, are superhero movies.
[02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:24.320]  Not westerns like when I was growing up, when I was growing up we had heroes with true grit,
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:30.160]  but they were human, human heroes. Now we have transhumanist heroes, as I said before
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:36.600]  we went to break. Secular humanism is the religion that is being taught in schools,
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:43.280]  but it is a religion without any hope, they don't offer any hope, but transhumanism does.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:48.200]  Transhumanism offers you the hope of eternal life, it offers you the hope of becoming like
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:52.320]  God, and it can be done in any number of ways, I mean look at all the different origin stories
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:56.800]  that we've got, you know, it can be genetic modification, it can be some kind of a magic
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:02.760]  incantation, it can be something that is done using technology, technological enhancement.
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:08.440]  When you go back and look at the film Alita, you know, we've got this robot that's very
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:13.680]  complex, that kind of plays into the fantasy of eternal life that Ray Kurzweil has embraced.
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:18.120]  And you know, hopefully if we can build robots like that we can transfer our consciousness,
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:24.080]  or whatever it is that makes us what we are. They can't quite define that. You know I had
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.040]  Zoltan Isvan of the transhumanist party come in and I said okay, you want to talk about
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.640]  transhumanism, how are you going to live forever, how are you going to transfer yourself into
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:37.200]  a robot and live forever, what is it that you're going to be transferring? Are you simply
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:42.480]  going to make, making a copy of yourself or are you going to be transferred in that?
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:50.260]  What are you? You have a physical component obviously, but what are you beyond physical?
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:56.360]  Is it just a bunch of electrical impulses or is there a spirit? And they don't really
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:01.200]  have an answer for that, but they are providing you with a mythology for that. As I said Joseph
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.920]  Campbell when he talks about the power of myth he said mythology provides a cultural
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:10.240]  framework for society to educate the young. And what are we telling them? We're telling
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:16.680]  them that with genetic modification, with robotics, with transference and so forth,
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:21.280]  they can live forever. They can become godlike. I think that's really what we are telling
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:28.200]  them. He also said that it provides a means of coping with passage from life to death.
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:34.600]  Or better yet, never die. Having eternal life as Ray Kurzweil points out. Let me give you
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:40.920]  an alternative perspective, a Christian perspective. You know, C.S. Lewis said that Christianity
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:48.040]  is both myth and fact. Now by that he doesn't mean that it's made up. He says that it is
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:56.000]  a true myth. It is God's myth, whereas the others are men's myth. And that is the essence
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.200]  of what we are looking at as Christians. That is the hope. That is what is not being taught
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:07.040]  to our children. That is what is not being given as the framework for our society by
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.720]  many of us. Maybe we don't even have that kind of a framework today. Because we don't
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:15.600]  even know what the meaning of life is. We can't even, we look at the abortion debate.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:22.320]  We can't even pinpoint when life begins or define it. Right? I think we can't, but we
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:27.080]  were struggling to say, well, it's a heartbeat or it's a brain activity. Certainly those are
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:33.120]  signs of life. And we can look at that and say we're going to protect anybody that has
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:39.600]  a sign of life. But it's going to be a philosophical understanding of where that life comes from
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.800]  or what it ultimately consists of. Who defines that? You know, when we talk about living
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:50.280]  eternally, C.S. Lewis had something else to say. He said he has never talked and neither
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.720]  have you to a mere mortal. He said, no matter who you've talked to, he said everyone is
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:01.800]  going to live for, everyone is going to exist forever. Question is in what state? He said
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.760]  some of the people that you see on the street as you're walking along, he says eventually
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.040]  they're going to be transformed into creatures that are so glorious that you'll be tempted
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:14.960]  to fall down and worship them. Others are going to be turned into creatures so hideous
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:21.080]  that you could not even bear to look at them. And so we have this choice before us. Immortal
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:27.760]  horrors or everlasting splendor. That is the understanding of what life is, what eternal
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.200]  life is for Christians. We are being sold a phony version and they're selling this
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.360]  version right now because of the control that they want to exercise. When you look at the
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:43.960]  neural laced brain, we look at this little girl with this cap on to read her mind, join
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:49.720]  the hive mind, join 5G. It is a system of total control. They have something in this
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:54.960]  world that they want to force upon you. And that is the philosophy that's behind it. That
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:05:00.080]  is what's so dangerous and subtle. I've got some really good news though. X2 is back.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:06.960]  The original X2, deep breath crystal, pure atomic iodine, what you want in FullWareStore.com.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.720]  It'll be here in a week, manufactured in the US in FullWareStore.com. It's the best iodine
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:15.920]  in the world. X2, it's available. I thought X3 is great. We still got another deep breath
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.840]  crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine, the scientists that do
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:24.480]  that. It's sold a lot, but people want original X2. I was resigned to the fact that we didn't
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:30.040]  have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again at FullWareStore.com.
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:35.440]  So hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months. We have now had the same
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:42.920]  company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:48.120]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy,
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:51.520]  learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:06:18.520]  going. Get yours today at FullWareStore.com or FullWareStore.com.
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:23.280]  Welcome back. We have Katie Hopkins joining us from the UK right now. She's got a book
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:31.520]  out called Rude. You can also find her on Twitter. Her Twitter handle is KTHopkins, and again,
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:38.040]  that's the letters KT. She's not spelling out her name, Katie, but it's KTHopkins.
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:41.880]  She's a British journalist. She's fighting back against the fall of Europe, and when
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:47.280]  Katie Hopkins was here in studio, I talked to her briefly about Brexit a couple of months
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.080]  ago, and she said, yeah, Britain has fallen. They're going to make sure that that doesn't
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:57.960]  go through. It's one of the most worrying things that I have seen. I was very excited
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:04.720]  to see Brexit go through, but now it looks like they have engineered a way to keep that
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:09.080]  from happening, and of course, part of that is by controlling the narrative. I want to
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:13.880]  talk to Katie about what is going to be happening with Brexit as well as how they are controlling
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:17.360]  the narrative. Joining us now from the UK is Katie Hopkins. Welcome, Katie.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:20.120]  Thank you very much for having me on your show.
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:23.520]  Thank you for joining. Tell us a little bit about what you think is going to be happening
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.960]  with Brexit. I talked to Paul Joseph Watson, he's in studio a couple of days ago. It looks
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:33.840]  like they have pretty much covered all their bases. I knew the fix was in when the only
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:40.800]  person that they put forward as a prime minister after the election was the conservative who
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:47.840]  opposed Brexit, but it's been very, very, I guess, manipulative how they have set this
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.720]  thing up. Tell us what you think is going to happen because it's the end of this month,
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:54.720]  right, that the hard Brexit date is coming up. You think they're going to delay it?
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:08:01.720]  That's right. So when our politicians opted to trigger Article 50, that's the legal mechanism
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:08.480]  by which we would leave the EU, that date is the 29th of March. So as things stand,
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:14.520]  on the 29th of March, the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal. And of course, for
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:19.840]  Brexiteers like myself, the 17.4 million who just wanted to leave, that's what we would
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:24.320]  love. We would love to leave without a deal. We would love to just get out the door and
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:30.800]  then sort things out from there. But what the government, the establishment, the remainers,
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:35.040]  those in power have managed to do is make this about a deal. So it looks like we will
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:41.520]  get either a deal that is remain or it may end up that we go back for a second vote where
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:49.080]  the only options are a really bad deal or in fact remain. And in that way, we've overturned
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.920]  the establishment has overturned the will of the people and it's beyond comprehension,
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:57.400]  especially for my American friends who are just like, what happened to the will of the
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:03.920]  people? Yeah, exactly. Why is the hard exit no longer an option?
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:10.200]  I mean, the government have created a very complex and fairly smart actually communication
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:17.200]  strategy to try to bewitch people with why no deal is not an option. If you can believe
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:22.920]  this and if your listeners and viewers can believe this, the government actually paid
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:31.040]  lorry drivers £250 or $300 a day to practice queuing so that they could take pictures
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.400]  of lorry's queuing to frighten people into thinking that there would be lots of queues
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:40.720]  after Brexit. I mean, this is the level of madness we're talking about. And today, the
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:46.120]  Daily Mail put out a piece saying, all Brits need new passports from tomorrow in the event
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:52.280]  of a no deal. It's just relentless scare tactics trying to grind people down. But I think,
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:58.680]  David, the really interesting thing is people aren't that stupid. And people now know their
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:04.160]  vote didn't count. So the bigger question in the UK is, who's ever going to vote again?
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:09.200]  How are you going to get close to 20 million people near a ballot box ever again?
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:13.520]  Yeah, it was amazing. I mean, when it came out, I was celebrating it. We're talking
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:17.400]  about how it was a declaration of independence. And of course, that happened just a couple
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:22.520]  of months before President Trump was elected. Things looked very, very optimistic. And yet,
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:28.280]  just as we've seen them pull these technical maneuvers to try to shut down different aspects
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.440]  of what President Trump is doing, it's absolutely amazing to see this. It reminds me of what
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:37.720]  Nigel Farage was saying when they took out the duly elected government of Greece a few
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:42.360]  years ago and then put in a former Goldman Sachs banker. And he goes, you're doing this
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.000]  at the heart of democracy where democracy, you just shut down their entire election.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.680]  Well, now they've done it in Britain as well. It's absolutely amazing.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.920]  It is a real craziness. And I think people are, you know, one of the things we're trying
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:57.680]  to talk about, one of the messages that I like to talk about is this idea of the social
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:02.880]  contracts. You know, we have democracy for a reason. It's part of a social contract.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:09.040]  We agree to do things like pay our taxes or abide by the law and order of the land in
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.560]  return for our vote. You take away our vote and it explains to me why we're going to keep
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:18.200]  paying our taxes. Why do we want to keep participating in this contract that we haven't seen the
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.160]  benefits of? So it will be interesting to see what's going to happen on the 29th of
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:28.560]  March, but probably one of the breaking stories that you guys have been covering on the 22nd
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.560]  of March. Now they've decided to send Tommy Robinson back to court. They are charging
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:40.960]  him again with contempt of court, a charge that was thrown out about five months ago.
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.440]  And of course, that is how I believe they think that they're going to be able to weather
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:50.080]  their storm. If they can shut down any opposition, any organized opposition, if they can take
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:56.600]  control of speech in the U.K. And of course, they have been even more upfront and obvious
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:01.680]  about it in the U.K. than they are here. Here they do it through the corporations and they
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.520]  say, well, it's just private corporations exercising their private rights and so forth.
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.680]  There the government comes in directly and gets in your face. They don't really have
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:15.400]  a problem with saying that they're doing it. Here they always try to have a mask, a corporate
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.520]  beer to do it, but they're very direct. And I think that is a key thing to come after
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:22.680]  Tommy Robinson to come after free speech in Britain.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:28.320]  Absolutely. And by making individuals that speak out like myself a target, they send
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:33.760]  a very clear message. So the message is, if you speak out, you will, many of the things
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:38.840]  that I've experienced, lose your job, lose your radio show, you will lose your column
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:45.040]  on the newspaper, you will lose your home as mine was taken by the court. You will be
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.760]  punished. We will clamp down on those people who speak out. And of course, the impact
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:55.200]  of that in my experience and in my email inbox is that you get so many emails from people
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:00.680]  saying, keep going, please keep going. We need you. You're our voice. And then you also
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:03.960]  get emails from people who are recognizing they have to pay their mortgage. They don't
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.360]  want to lose their job. And so they're silenced. And of course, at a deeper level, that means
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:15.000]  that people are thinking, can I say this before they open them out? Is this a wrong thought
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.880]  and once you start to have an entire population double checking before they even have the
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:24.880]  thoughts, your ability to control that population is magnified, I think.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.560]  Oh, yeah. And that's the Chinese model. I mean, that has been ingrained in their society
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:32.680]  for a very long time. You mentioned something that I'm not familiar with. And I've heard
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:38.000]  you many times speak. You said losing your home. Tell me about that. I don't know about
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  that story.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:47.520]  Yeah. So with a case on Twitter, I put up a tweet that was incorrect. But the system,
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:53.480]  a mechanism, a new law was created that made me guilty of libel for putting up a tweet
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:14:00.680]  that was deleted, that was apologized for, that was retracted. They pursued that case
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:07.600]  to the point where I had to sell my home in order to fund the damages and the costs of
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:13.240]  that court proceedings. That's new law that says that damage to reputation is incurred
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:17.480]  at the time of publication. And because mine isn't a large account with about a million
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:24.480]  followers, they penalize me significantly. And with all my other work in jobs, in radio,
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.080]  in national newspaper columns, they've always either gone after the sponsors or gone up
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:35.600]  the ladder and had those columns or programs removed. So certainly for me, I've paid a
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.360]  price. You know, there was a jihadi plot up ahead of me. The state commissioned a play
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:46.560]  called the assassination of Casey Hopkins. Like you say, they don't hide what their intent
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.560]  is here in my country.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:52.280]  Well, I'm so sorry to hear that. They do the same thing here in America. I mean, you look
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.520]  at what they did with General Flynn and he lost his home trying to defend himself from
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.640]  criminal charges. They don't come in and say, well, we're coming after you because of what
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.880]  you said. They will manufacture a different reason. They'll manufacture a process crime
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:09.200]  somewhere the same way they're coming after Roger Stone. Now, they'll manufacture some
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:13.840]  kind of a, you know, a process crime that has to do with a immaterial statement that
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.000]  you made to somebody and say, oh, well, you know, you committed perjury or whatever, and
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.760]  they'll do it on that basis. They won't just come in and say, well, we don't like what
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:24.000]  you had to say. So we're going to sue it and take it. But they are right up front about
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.280]  what they're doing in the UK. When we come back, I want to talk to you about your new
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:33.000]  documentary homelands about Western Europeans who are fleeing Europe. We'll be right back
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  with Katie Hopkins and stay with us. You can find her again on Twitter, Katie Hopkins.

[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:29.960]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:35.040]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:41.920]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:47.720]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:56.560]  World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:22.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:27.160]  Welcome back. I'm David Knight and we're talking to Katie Hopkins in the U.K. and you can
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:34.120]  find her on Twitter at kthopkins. Her book is rude and she's got a documentary called
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:38.280]  Homeland. A new documentary talking about Western Europeans fleeing Europe. I want to
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:43.520]  get some more information about that from Katie. First question, Katie, where are they
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:49.400]  going? It's been so interesting, actually. It's one of the things that's not spoken
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:56.440]  about because migration to us is about caravans of people at the border or migrants coming
[02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:01.680]  across the med, you know, snaking their way through the countryside. But there's a quiet
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:07.440]  migration underway, one that no one is talking about. And that is the exodus of Jews from
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:14.240]  places like Paris and Germany and the movement of people like myself, Christian white Christians
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:19.800]  or Christian Brits, Christian culture, really, looking for a new place to call home. So I've
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:25.880]  just spent a few months from France, from Israel in Germany and in the north of England
[02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:32.840]  where people are looking for their Judeo-Christian heritage. They're looking for a new place
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:40.280]  to start afresh. And so I follow Jewish families making Aliyah to Israel, starting anew. And
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:45.280]  also some of the white Brits, because we're outnumbered now in London, in Birmingham,
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:51.680]  in Bradford, in Luton, I could carry on. I spent time in a town in the U.K. called Saviltown.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:56.120]  It's in the north in the sort of, if you imagine the land of rolling green hills and mills,
[02:21:56.120 --> 02:22:04.280]  it used to be an old mill town making fabric. It's now 97% Muslim. I being there, I increased
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:11.200]  the white population by 4%. You try being a white person in that town. So this is the
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:16.920]  homeland is the movement of our people looking for a new place to call home. And I think
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:21.720]  it's widely untouched about, but I think we're going to see more and more on this, especially
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:25.320]  with the Jews needing to get out of France and get out of France fast.
[02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:31.200]  Well, again, instead of immigration, you're talking about emigration with an E as in,
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:36.040]  you know, exiting and exiting Europe is really what people are talking about here. I see
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:41.520]  a similar thing happening here in America. My wife grew up on Long Island. Now the areas
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:49.080]  where she grew up, they have rampant problems with MS13 and violence there because the population
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:53.080]  has completely changed. You know, when she was growing up, it was basically people who
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:57.040]  are Italian and Polish that were living in those neighborhoods. Now it is people coming
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:03.720]  from El Salvador. And along with the legitimate people who are trying to flee violence, you
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:10.000]  have MS13 coming. And one individual who had his child killed by MS13 was saying, I came
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.760]  here to escape that. Well, you can't escape that if the borders open, you know, the MS13
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:19.840]  is going to come in and do that. And right now, MS13 is killing Hispanic children who
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:24.080]  are not part of their gang or, you know, they have a romantic rival or something like that.
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:27.680]  But that violence is going to spread to other people in the community if in fact there is
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:31.320]  anybody in the community other than El Salvador. But they've basically taken over that Long
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:33.120]  Island town where my wife grew up.
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:37.400]  Exactly. And I think this is the thing for me and my learning is that it isn't really
[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:43.560]  about race or color, any of those things. That's right. It's about this idea of diversity.
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:48.240]  And diversity, of course, must be a positive thing, etc. Except if you go to a town where
[02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:55.200]  97% of the people are Muslim, where is the diversity? Where is the diversity? We were
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:58.920]  told that, you know, was so great for our country. And I think the other thing that
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:03.880]  was really striking for me was sitting with Jewish people now in Israel thrilled to be
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:08.440]  in a new place, talking about how they were called dirty Jew or whatever, just walking
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:14.040]  in the streets of Paris. This is today in 2019. And it got me to thinking, I'm talking
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:19.520]  to a rabbi, that for many of us, we don't have somewhere to run to. We don't have a
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:24.080]  place to make Aliyah. We don't have a new place to call home. And I know that a lot
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:30.040]  of my friends, colleagues, other regular Brits are increasingly looking eastwards to sort
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:36.160]  of Poland and Hungary, wondering if their strong stand for our Christian culture could
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:42.960]  be where we end up taking our families to? Yeah, I've seen some, we were looking at that
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:49.720]  as well, because my wife is part Polish. Take a look at that, because she doesn't have any
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:54.520]  connections to that anymore. But, you know, I've seen the strong stand as you pointed
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:25:00.600]  out that they've taken and how they're focused on building families and how they understand
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:04.200]  that they need a homeland for their own culture. It's absolutely fine. All these people who
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:09.480]  talk about multiculturalism don't really respect that. I mean, you look at Europe, when I went
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:15.240]  there as a high school student, it was a rich tapestry of different cultures that were Latin.
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:20.280]  I mean, tiny countries by U.S. standards are smaller than our states. And yet, in each
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.320]  of these, they had their own culture. They had different music, different architecture,
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:29.040]  different languages, and it was amazing to be able to see that many different cultures
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.120]  in such a short period of time. But now they want to dumb everything down into this homogenized,
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:40.120]  gray, cultural-less area. But I think there's a more sinister aspect of this as well, Katie.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:44.360]  Going back to 2000, the U.N. was selling this idea that we had to have massive migration
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:49.760]  because of the welfare state, because of the social system, what we call social security
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:54.800]  here. They said, we've got this inversion of population because it's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:58.720]  You're not having enough kids. A lot of reasons for that. But you're not having enough kids,
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:01.040]  so we're going to have to bring in people from other places to support you in your
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:04.640]  old age. And yet, that is exactly what is not happening, right?
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:09.560]  Absolutely. And we've just had a case this week where, for the first time, people are
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:14.720]  now waking up because parents in the U.K., looking for secondary school places for their
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:20.960]  children, so that, like, 11, 12 years old, upwards have been told there are no places
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:26.560]  for their children. And the school has said, in particular, it's because of new arrivals,
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:34.800]  international new arrivals. And so, and the fact is that in 2021, one in 25 of our councils
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:39.720]  have no places for children at secondary school level. So this is where the leftists that
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:45.040]  say, oh, well, immigration is great for our country. It's a net advantage we gain. Sure.
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.760]  Now try being a mom of a teenage child who doesn't have a school to go to. And, you know,
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:57.560]  the demographics here in the U.K. are shocking by 2035 Muslim births outnumber white British
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:02.160]  births. You know, we are being replaced at a rapid rate, and our children are running
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:04.160]  out of school places to go to.
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:07.440]  Yeah, they planned that. And then they saw the people saying, you're going to be fine
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:09.880]  with this. They're going to take care of you in your old age. Yeah, they were going to
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.080]  take care of you in a different way. We see this happening in London right now, the exploding
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:20.640]  crime. I mean, you just had five people stabbed in five days.
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:25.520]  It's literally craziness in London. So there's another stabbing today in West Kensington,
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:30.320]  which is quite a smart area. That young boy died on the street. At the same time, we got
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:35.960]  news that someone stabbed earlier in the week just died. The stabbings are completely out
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:41.640]  of control. You know, there's three elements in my opinion, which is initiation. So some
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:47.480]  people stab each other for initiation into the gangs. They're stabbing for retaliation
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:52.480]  and they're stabbing for delineation, delineating their territories. But one thing's for sure,
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:58.040]  we don't have a knife crime problem. Knives are not the problem. We have a gang problem.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:27:59.040]  Yeah.
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.600]  It's the same with guns in America, right? They love to frame the gun, not the person
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:03.600]  behind it.
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:08.320]  Yeah, absolutely. Well, what you're talking about there, again, with Islam and the three
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:13.080]  different aspects of how they're doing that is the same thing that's happening with the
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:18.760]  MS-13 gangs. And they know that these kids are from a foreign country. They know that
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:22.360]  they're coming here illegally. We say we're going to defer any action on them. And that
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:26.700]  is still going on under the Trump administration. That was an executive action by the previous
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:31.040]  administration. President Trump could stop that at any time if he had the political will.
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:34.400]  And yet they allow that to continue to go on. These people even have the tattoos on
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:39.600]  their face to tell you that they are MS-13, but they wait until something happens to even
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.920]  other Hispanic kids before they'll do anything about it. We'll be right back with Katie Hopkins.
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:55.440]  Stay with us.

[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:19.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:30.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David Knight. Welcome back.
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:36.680]  We're talking to Katie Hopkins. You can find her on Twitter at KT Hopkins. And she has
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:41.440]  a documentary that's going to be coming up. I believe it's March the 13th. Katie, is that
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:48.680]  correct? Yes, that's the launch date. Thank you. In Strasburg, in the European Parliament.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:54.720]  So I'd like to take my work to the heart. That's the enemy territory. And I'm presenting
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:00.440]  it in association with ENF. That's European Nations for Freedom. So if you imagine things
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:07.000]  like Salvini and the AFD and the league, all the great people who are fighting for freedom
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:12.880]  in Europe, who are Trump supporters, that's the organization that's helping me bring homelands
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:17.000]  to the European Parliament. And then I will have an update of where people can watch it.
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.320]  I'm hoping to get over to you guys at info wars so that your viewers can watch it. I think
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.800]  it's really interesting in terms of a migration that's not being talked about, people being
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:29.640]  forced out of their countries. So you're going to premiere it right there with the people
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:35.000]  who are behind these policies. Let's play a short clip here of the trailer for it. We
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:41.320]  got about a 30 second clip here. This is a trailer for the documentary homelands. On
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:48.240]  September 1st, 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland, World War II began, and then what led to the
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:56.160]  Holocaust. But it didn't start on September 1st. It began way before when synagogues were
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:02.520]  banned, when Jews were targeted, they weren't allowed certain jobs, they weren't allowed
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.560]  to live certain places. It started there. And some Jewish communities in the world should
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:14.280]  treat every day when they wake up in the morning every day. This might be September 1st, 1939.
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:22.120]  Yeah, that's very true. And so the question is, where do Europeans go? The Jews have a homeland
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:27.800]  now in Israel that they can immigrate to and be protected. Where are we going to go in this?
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.240]  That's exactly right. I should point out as well that Doron there, that's Doron Kramer,
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:39.240]  who's a journalist, one of the biggest papers in Israel. He used to be a basketball player.
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:45.480]  So I'm five foot eight. I'm quite tall. He is seven foot four. So I was walking down the road
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:50.840]  trying to interview him like this. I noticed that discrepancy. I didn't remember you being that
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:56.360]  short. I mean, you look like a hobbit talking to him. Yeah, halfling. I was like, can I stand on a
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:02.280]  bench to talk to Doron? Anyway, I love him. But the really the other thing that struck me, you
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:05.640]  know, it's the stuff that makes the hares when you're doing these interviews, the hairs on the
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:10.920]  back of your neck stand up. A lady said a French Jewish lady who was called a dirty Jew in the
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:17.800]  streets in Paris. A few months back, she said, you know, we have to remember the pessimists are
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:24.040]  now in LA with a pool. The optimists are in Auschwitz. And she and her husband have made a
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:29.160]  journey to Israel. And they've even bought an apartment there for her children because she's
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:36.040]  desperate for her children to get out of Paris. There is a real tangible fear that people are
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:40.680]  leaving it too late to leave. But absolutely, I came away. I was asking the rabbi, I should
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:45.720]  have got you the clip before asking the rabbi, where am I going to go? Where are my people
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:49.960]  going to go? We don't have an Israel and Aliyah is amazing. You know, they help pay for your
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:55.240]  flights your your first year, they support you financially, you know, give you accommodation
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:37:00.760]  and they meet you at the Israeli Jewish people making Aliyah. They meet them at the airport
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.560]  with their paperwork to make them nationals Israeli nationals. I think it's, you know,
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:10.040]  gentlemen got really upset speaking to me about it because he said for once finally,
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:15.480]  he felt accepted and he felt like he was home. And I think this has been a narrative of our time.
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:21.800]  And again, what we're seeing is the rise of this in France because the massive migration
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:28.280]  of Islam into France. That's the basis of this. I've talked to Simon Rosh in South Africa multiple
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:34.120]  times and I pulled him on again last week because of what I hear coming from the Democrats in this
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:40.280]  country. It looks to me like a verbatim replay of what we've the anti-Semitism that we've seen
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.000]  against Jews in Germany, what we see going on in France now, but we see that not only with the
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.240]  white people in South Africa, kill the boar, take their farms and so forth. But I'm seeing it now
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.280]  from the Democrat Party here in America when they talk about reparations. They have absolutely no way
[02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:00.760]  that they can put this through because they can't define here in America. We've had a lot of
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:05.800]  intermarrying over the decades, over the centuries between black and white. Who's going to define
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:10.920]  who is black? Who's white? Who is going to define whose ancestors own slaves? But they don't care
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:17.160]  because it's about creating that hatred of the other, isn't it? Yeah, you're so right. And I think
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:26.200]  as a Brit watching Ilhan Omar, watching Rashida Talib with her Palestinian flag, it gives me
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:32.600]  anxiety because we're so much further down that line. We know how this works. You get densely packed
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:38.120]  Muslim populations. You facilitate those with masks where funds can flow in. You have people
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:42.200]  suddenly voting according to their religion. And before you know it, you've got political Islam,
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:47.960]  people voting by their faith, how Allah wants them to vote. And you've got that right now.
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:53.240]  You've got Ilhan Omar who was out there on the campaign trail with her jazzy orange headdress
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:58.600]  looking a bit tropical and modern. And now she's in your Congress with the black headdress on. It's
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:05.480]  all got very serious starting to come out with some of this kind of narrative that is so anti-Israel,
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:11.160]  so anti-Semitic. I really fear you guys are not very far behind us in the complete
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:15.640]  political Islam, which I think is particularly dangerous.
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.800]  Yeah, yeah. Well, again, you know, in the process of demonizing white people,
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:23.960]  and that's what this reparations is really about. And you've got all the major Democrat
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:29.000]  candidates for president now signing into it either explicitly or implicitly saying,
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.880]  yeah, there has to be something I'm not sure exactly how it's going to look at. But you've got
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:35.560]  Kamala Harris, you've got Cory Booker, you've got Elizabeth Warren, all them,
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:41.640]  and many others have signed into this. But when we look at, as you pointed out, Ilhan Omar,
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:46.440]  you know, we changed the law so that she could cover her head. I think it's important to take
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:52.920]  a look at what's going on right now in Saudi Arabia. They have an app for that in Saudi Arabia.
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.320]  And if you want to know what life in Islamic America is like, take a look at what's going
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:00.280]  on in Saudi Arabia right now. We've got an American citizen, as a matter of fact,
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:04.360]  who is trapped there. I've talked about this multiple times on my show in the morning,
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:10.280]  this app called Abshur. It is being sold by both Google and by Apple. You know, Apple shut down
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:15.640]  the Infowars app. But if you want to get an app to track your women that they treat like
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:19.000]  chattel because they all have to have a mail guardian, they have to have his permission,
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:23.640]  you get that app, it is put out there by the Kingdom's Interior Ministry. They own and operate
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.800]  that app. They've encouraged people to go in and rate it. So it's highly rated. Google has just said
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:35.000]  that it is cleared for sale by Google. And this is that you can track, you put in the number of
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:39.880]  the women that belong to you. And whenever they're traveling, you get notification from the Saudi
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:45.080]  government asking if you want to give them permission to travel. I mean, can you imagine the
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:51.720]  levels of madness we are now stooping to, you know, this is the level of madness in our society.
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:56.440]  And it's bizarre, of course, because we can all see it happening. We all know it's a madness.
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:41:01.000]  And yet it's continuing. It's not we're not stopping it somehow. We're failing to stop
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:07.240]  this happening to ourselves. But yeah, Ilhad Omar, I really am concerned about in terms of,
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:13.240]  you know, we see it in London, we have a Muslim mayor, and then we have a Muslim housing association,
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:18.360]  we have a Muslim police association, you know, before long, you just get the sense that there's
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:24.040]  no place for us. And Muslims and Islam are in control. One of the things that's scaring me
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:30.760]  slightly as well, I've just read in Houston, there's a mosque that's being opened up for Spanish
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:37.000]  speaking individuals. So sort of Southern Americans to try and infiltrate Spanish speaking people
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:42.520]  with Islam, which I think is quite sinister in itself. Well, you know, you have this
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:47.560]  schizophrenia, especially the Democrat Party, where they want to celebrate Ilhad Omar,
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:54.440]  they want to celebrate her hijab. And yet at the same time, this this culture, this religion,
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:59.480]  is doing this in terms of setting up an app to actually track women and to shut down their
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:03.640]  movement, even though they've gone out, the Saudis have gone outside. Oh, look, we're going to let
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:08.200]  them drive. Well, you're not going to drive without the permission of a male guardian. I mean, that's
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:12.760]  the bed. Of course, they want to put all of us into that position. They want us all to have
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:18.840]  travel restrictions, unless our government lets us know that we can travel. It's absolutely insane.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.320]  Thank you so much for joining us, Katie Hopkins. Again, her documentary Homeland is going to have
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:28.120]  its premiere on March 13. And we'll have updates on where people can get that. Of course, you'll
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:34.760]  probably find it from her Twitter, which is KT Hopkins. That's where you'll find her on Twitter.
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:50.680]  Thank you so much for joining us, Katie. Have a great show. All right, we'll be right back. Thank you.

[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:07.800]  who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage. We took on Hillary Clinton.
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.600]  We stopped her. We got a national stand. Nationalists are getting elected all over the

[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:27.880]  Welcome back. We've got one more segment and then Mike Adams is going to be taking over
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:35.320]  in the fourth hour. I just had this given to me by the staff here. This is a very well-kept secret.
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:42.120]  I talked about CBD and that article from the Daily Mail. I talked about the context of a guy who
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:46.520]  basically really didn't care about taking care of his health. He had a respiratory illness,
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:52.040]  but in spite of that, he smoked 20 cigarettes a day in his youth, 20s and 30s. He eventually stopped
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:57.720]  smoking, but then he eventually got lung cancer and he refused all forms of cancer treatment.
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:02.520]  He didn't want chemotherapy, didn't want radiation or surgery, but he did after a while because the
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:08.520]  tumors were growing. He took some CBD oil and the doctors, they were absolutely amazed. They said,
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:13.000]  we know this guy didn't take anything. He doesn't take anything for his health. He doesn't try to
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.800]  do anything to help. So, it was simply him taking CBD oil for a couple of months and we saw this
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:24.680]  tumor basically essentially disappear in just two months. He had multiple tumors in his lungs
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:30.440]  and to metastasize to his lymph system and so forth. I didn't realize we have a CBD product here.
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:35.880]  It's called Washington's Reserve. You can find that at InfowarsStore.com. Take a look at that.
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:46.200]  I'll be looking at that myself, quite frankly. Certainly, there are a lot of anecdotal at this
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:53.560]  point, success stories of CBD because they won't do the studies. You may have some studies start now
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:49:00.040]  that Boehner is making money from. Remember, he always said he was unalterably opposed to it
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:05.720]  until he became an investor in it and now he is a big supporter of that. If you want to take
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:08.920]  a look at some of the other products that we have at InfowarsStore.com, as I was saying before,
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:14.600]  we've got some great specials. Right now, we have 50% off both alpha power and body ease. Again,
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.240]  body ease is a natural supplement. Turmeric is great for fighting inflation, whether it's in
[02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:24.840]  your joints or other parts of your body. We have that 50% off along with alpha power. We have 33%
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:32.360]  off DNA force. That is a very expensive and difficult product to produce and so it frequently
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  goes out of stock. We have it in stock right now and we have it at 33% off. That's a big savings
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:44.280]  right now with DNA force. We've got a lot of different products that are on sale right now.
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:50.360]  We have Infowars Select storeable food products, 50% off. They're storeable for up to 25 years,
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:55.880]  9 GMO. They're resealable after you eventually use them. A great product. Take a look at the
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:02.200]  products that we have at InfowarsStore.com. I've got an interesting story here. We had a couple of
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:09.720]  guys that played a hoax on Elliott Abrams, a couple of Russian comedians and they engaged him
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.480]  and whether or not he was going to be attacking Venezuela. They pretended that they were
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:20.520]  with the Swiss government and they got him to make some interesting statements. I want to get
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:25.880]  in and play that video for you. Before we do real quickly, I just want to follow up as we're talking
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:35.080]  to Katie Hopkins about immigration and other issues. We have Congressman Al Green from Texas
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:41.960]  lecturing Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen saying white babies would not be treated the
[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:49.480]  way these babies of color are being treated at the border. I just saw that and thought of the
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:56.040]  amazing hypocrisy behind that. We have talked many times about black genocide that is being
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:00.520]  conducted by Planned Parenthood. As a matter of fact, that's what they were very open about,
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:05.720]  Margaret saying and others. When you look at the way black babies are being treated,
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:11.160]  there is a big difference at Planned Parenthood. You want to put out this narrative that babies
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:15.640]  are being ripped from their parents at the border? That's not true. As a matter of fact,
[02:51:15.640 --> 02:51:19.480]  they are putting them in military housing. Where did they get the authority to do that?
[02:51:19.480 --> 02:51:24.520]  Did President Trump have to go to Congress to get authority to detain the families together
[02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:29.880]  and military bases? Of course not. As Commander-in-Chief, he could do that at the military bases
[02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:36.040]  in the same way he could protect the border without any additional allocation of funds
[02:51:36.040 --> 02:51:39.960]  because it's part of defending this country. But they don't even know that these babies coming
[02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:47.080]  across the border are actually babies of these parents. They're trying to do DNA testing in
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:52.920]  some cases. But when you rip the baby out of the mother at a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic,
[02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:57.560]  and this is happening many, many times more to black babies than it is to white babies,
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:02.360]  that's why we talk about black genocide. And that was the purpose from the very beginning.
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:07.320]  Margaret Singer and Prescott Bush, the patriarch of the Bush clan, was her treasure
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:13.880]  at the very beginning. She was open about talking about doing this to control the black
[02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:19.000]  population. They put the majority of Planned Parenthood clinics in the black community.
[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:25.480]  And again, they are having this at many multiples of that. So Al Green, if you want to get serious
[02:52:25.480 --> 02:52:30.200]  about this, then why don't you take a look at what's going on in Planned Parenthood,
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:35.480]  because they really are ripping the babies away from their mothers and ripping the babies apart
[02:52:35.480 --> 02:52:39.320]  in these Planned Parenthood clinics. But of course, you won't do that, because that is the
[02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:46.200]  Democrat right, R-I-T-E. It is a ritual that they do not want to give up. One last thing about
[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:52.760]  immigration, then we'll get into this situation with the Russian pranksters and Elliot Richardson
[02:52:52.760 --> 02:53:00.520]  and Venezuela. We just had a California, a second California judge say that to ask on the census
[02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:06.360]  whether or not you are a citizen threatens the very foundation of U.S. democracy. No, I would say
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:10.120]  that what they are doing, what these judges are doing threatens the very foundation of the U.S.
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:17.400]  democracy. You understand that we had a census specifically to allocate representation. And
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:23.000]  it's representation of people who are citizens, not people who are not citizens. And that's why,
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:29.080]  up until I guess it was about 20 years ago, they always asked, are you a citizen? And that,
[02:53:29.080 --> 02:53:33.880]  quite frankly, is the only thing that they have the authority to ask. They should not be asking
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:38.920]  and demanding information about you in any other respect. That's none of their business. But it
[02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:44.280]  is their business to know whether or not you are an American citizen, because only American citizens
[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:48.680]  should be allowed to vote. But of course, that's something else that the California judges and
[02:53:48.680 --> 02:53:54.280]  these other people who have set themselves up above the Constitution don't care to pay any
[02:53:54.280 --> 02:54:01.080]  attention to. Let's go to this clip. It was put out by Sputnik News. These are a couple of
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:09.080]  Russian comedians, telephone pranksters, Vovan and Lexus, just like the car, I guess. They called
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:14.760]  up Elliott Abrams. They engaged him in conversation about what he was going to do with Venezuela,
[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:19.000]  because a lot of us are wondering whether they are going to set up a military operation. You
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.920]  know, we're coming to March. And March is, the aides of March are typically when the American
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:29.320]  government, especially in the last several years, have been trying to march off to war in Syria.
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:34.600]  Now they're talking about Venezuela. So this is what Elliott Abrams told these Russian telephone
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:39.560]  pranksters when he thought that they were calling him from the government of Switzerland. Also,
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:45.240]  I wanted to ask you, what are your thoughts about possible military aid to the president of
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:55.480]  Guaida? President Guaida. You know, we're not going to do that unless the regime does something
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:55:06.840]  completely crazy like, you know, attacking the U.S. embassy. Yeah, I know. But our information suggests
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:15.560]  that people in the regime and in the military are actually nervous about a U.S. invasion. And we
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:23.560]  think it is useful to keep them nervous, which is one reason that we will not say publicly,
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:29.400]  no, no, no, this will never happen. When I give private briefings to members of Congress, this
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:35.160]  is exactly what I say to them. We are not trying to make you in Congress nervous. We are trying to
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:41.880]  make the Venezuelan military nervous. And we think that it is a mistake, tactically, to give them
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:47.720]  endless reassurances that there will never be American military action. But I can tell you,
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:53.080]  this is not what we're doing. What we're doing is what you see, financial pressure, economic pressure,
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:57.160]  diplomatic pressure, political pressure. Yeah, I agree with you. And again, they're posing as a
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:05.160]  Swiss president. When you listen to that, they don't, I don't know, they have a very heavy Russian accent to me.
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:10.680]  Elliot Richardson didn't catch that. I don't know, does he not get out too much? I mean, this is,
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:16.600]  this guy's been an ambassador, does he not get out of the country too much? I mean, he's pretty
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:19.960]  provincial if he doesn't catch that Russian accent. But he thought he was talking to the
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:24.760]  Swiss president. And the good news is, because it's not just people, I don't know that Congress
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:29.640]  is getting nervous about a war. Did they ever get nervous about wars? I mean, they didn't really
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:35.000]  seem to care too much about Syria or Afghanistan or many of these other places. Do they, are they
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:39.240]  really nervous about Venezuela? I'm nervous about it. I don't want to see American blood and
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:43.560]  treasure spent on that. I want to fight socialism, but I want to fight socialism here in America.
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:48.680]  That's where I'm concerned about it. Well, people in Venezuela fight with socialism,
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:53.080]  let them deal with the effects of it, let them be the poster child for why we don't want it here
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:57.240]  in this country if they're unable to do anything or unwilling to do anything about it. I mean,
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:04.200]  we've already got North Korea, North Korea versus South Korea. We had, you know, Mao's China versus
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:10.120]  Hong Kong versus Taiwan. We had East and West Germany. How many more of these cases do we need
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:17.320]  to show the world what a centrally planned economy looks like with these people who are
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:23.400]  control freaks? Why are we even thinking about this here in America? It's absolutely insane. We
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:28.360]  have to have Rand Paul introducing a bill to end the war in Afghanistan. We've gotten to a position
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:35.000]  where all wars are by default permitted unless they are expressly prohibited. We have turned the
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.880]  Constitution upside down and inside out. Thanks for listening. Stay with us. Mike Adams is coming up.
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:52.360]  I've got some really good news, though. X2 is back. The original X2, deep breath crystal, pure
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:58.680]  atomic iodine, what you want, infowarstore.com. It'll be here in a week, manufactured in the US,
[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:03.720]  infowarstore.com with the best iodine in the world. X2, it's available. I thought X3 is great. We
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:07.640]  still got another deep breath crystal source, but I thought at the other two types of iodine,
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:13.080]  the scientists said do that. It sold a lot, but people want original X2. I was resigned the fact
[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:18.840]  we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:24.360]  So, hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:32.200]  company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:36.920]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy,

[03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:23.720]  filling in for the other amazing hosts. And isn't it great to see David Knight back, by the way?
[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:28.920]  Many blessings to David Knight doing such a great job, incredible research on all the news. I'm just
[03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:34.280]  just so happy to see him back in the seat there in the new studio as well. Now, I've got an incredible
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:39.720]  lineup of breaking information for you today. You know, I always prepare as well, maybe not as much
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:45.400]  as David Knight does, but I do my best. And today I've got some big news to bring you about the
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:52.600]  American Association of Physicians and Surgeons denouncing mandatory vaccines, denouncing
[03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:59.240]  those policies as being kind of junk science, that there's no rigorous safety studies about
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:06.440]  vaccines, that it takes away individual liberty. So we have a group of doctors and physicians now
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:12.600]  citing individual liberty. Yes, you heard that right. I'm going to cover that here on the Alex
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:18.520]  Jones show. And at the same time, you have a disturbing development now where pro second
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:24.920]  amendment groups and publishers are now pushing vaccines. So we have this weird twisted alternate
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:30.200]  reality happening now, where you've got physicians groups saying, no, mandatory vaccines are bad
[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:35.800]  and dangerous and non unproven. And then you've got these second amendment groups saying, Oh,
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:41.880]  no, vaccinate everybody, you know, gunpoint vaccinations are awesome. So this insanity,
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:46.280]  I'm going to lay it out for you. I'm going to detail it here on the Alex Jones show. Let me
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:52.200]  give you kind of a rundown here, a table of contents of what's coming up. We've also got research
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:58.680]  about how measles vaccines are now proven to spread the measles. This is due to a scientific
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:04.600]  breakthrough in genetic sequencing. I'll be covering that in great detail. I wrote a story
[03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:09.320]  about that yesterday on natural news, but there are some highlights of that you absolutely need
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:14.840]  to know about because you know how, you know, false flag events or staged events, or you could say
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:21.560]  real events, but augmented with with hyperbole and so on, are used to take away your gun rights.
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:28.520]  Well, it turns out that measles vaccines cause the spread of measles in some children a little over
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:35.080]  a third of the measles cases that are diagnosed turn out to be traced back to the measles vaccine
[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:39.720]  itself. So about one out of every three cases of measles is actually caused by a measles vaccine,
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:44.520]  according to this research. So we're going to go into that and show you why these sort of,
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:48.840]  you might call them infectious disease, false flags, in a sense, are used to push
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:54.840]  mandatory vaccines. So false flag operations are always used to take away your liberty,
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:59.800]  to take away your rights, to have big government jumping in on your life and telling you what
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:04.680]  to do, what you have to do, putting a gun to your head, sometimes literally putting a gun to your
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:12.520]  head and saying we demand that we penetrate the bodies of your children with these toxic substances
[03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:17.240]  that we know harm and kill some children because the government publishes statistics on that every
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:23.880]  year. And yes, children are harmed by vaccines. So that's coming up too. Also today, there's a
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:32.680]  civil war scenario that could occur surrounding the 2020 election and involving what's called the
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:41.960]  National Popular Vote Pact, where now 12 U.S. states have agreed to push their electoral votes
[03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:49.400]  over to whoever wins the quote, popular vote. And there's a scenario that could lead to civil
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:54.520]  war with this. I'm going to talk about that in detail. By the way, to the crew, I'm not seeing
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:59.880]  the clock. So let me know, get that clock up there for me so I can segue out here when the time is
[03:03:59.880 --> 03:04:07.720]  right. Also, some scenarios of how Trump made dump massive documents, even if he loses the
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:14.120]  election in 2020, which I don't think will happen, but also comments about his second term and why
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:20.760]  the Trump second term will be much stronger than Trump's first term. A couple other comments too
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:27.240]  about how everything the left promotes is an affront to God. The slippery slope of censorship,
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:32.440]  they started with Alex Jones. Of course, now they're censoring vaccine information. I do hear
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:38.040]  the music. Thank you. What's coming up next? Censorship of fluoride, excuse me, fluoride, GMOs,
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:43.880]  pesticides, and anti-cancer foods will all be censored soon. So all that straight ahead here
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:48.200]  on the Alex Jones show, stay with me here. We'll be right back after this break, short break,
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:59.240]  or much more. Stay with us. I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and
[03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:06.040]  I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most
[03:05:06.040 --> 03:05:13.400]  suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant,
[03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:18.760]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:24.680]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:30.280]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary, and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:36.360]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty
[03:05:36.360 --> 03:05:41.320]  away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've done,
[03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:44.760]  but I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:49.720]  financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[03:05:49.720 --> 03:06:14.920]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[03:06:20.680 --> 03:06:25.240]  and freedoms are now so aggressive where you've got now, I mean, think about in Congress now,
[03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:33.400]  they're they're allowing Democrats to be anti-semitism pushers. Their hatred is okay,
[03:06:33.400 --> 03:06:40.600]  right? Their hatred is excused by the radical left. But then they say that you being a Christian,
[03:06:40.600 --> 03:06:44.280]  let's say, oh, you're, you're, you're engaged in hate speech, you have to be censored and banned,
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:50.600]  but their hatred against Jews is totally fine. You know what I mean? And it's just so that the
[03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:55.560]  hypocrisy is so blatant, it's out of control. It's just, here we go again, things are getting crazy.
[03:06:55.560 --> 03:07:01.320]  But getting to the main story today, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons
[03:07:01.320 --> 03:07:05.560]  has just put out, well, actually, it was over a week ago that they put this out, but it's just
[03:07:05.560 --> 03:07:12.120]  starting to surface. They put out a huge statement opposing mandatory vaccines. Now, again,
[03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:16.760]  this is a pro vaccine group. So, you know, I want to be upfront about that. They're not opposed to
[03:07:16.760 --> 03:07:24.520]  all vaccines. It's a pro vaccine group. But they are adhering to this, this foundational principle
[03:07:24.520 --> 03:07:30.280]  of what's called informed consent, which means the doctor. And by the way, this is also this idea
[03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:35.560]  is promoted by the American Medical Association of informed consent. The doctor is supposed to
[03:07:35.560 --> 03:07:41.960]  inform you or the parent in the case of a child, inform you, okay, here are the possible benefits
[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:48.360]  of this intervention. And here are the possible risks. Now, you decide. You decide, because guess
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:54.760]  what? It's your body. The doctors are supposed to inform people and then let people make decisions
[03:07:54.760 --> 03:07:58.840]  about what medical interventions they want. Because the truth is, and this is what the
[03:07:58.840 --> 03:08:06.200]  vaccine pushers deny, the truth is that every medical intervention carries a risk. And the vaccine
[03:08:06.200 --> 03:08:10.920]  industry lies about that. And they say, they just blatantly lie. And they say, well, vaccines have
[03:08:10.920 --> 03:08:16.840]  never hurt anyone. Are you kidding me? The government publishes statistics every year in the VAERS
[03:08:16.840 --> 03:08:23.720]  database. That's VAERS. I think it's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. It's part of HHS.
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:31.480]  You can just go to the website vaers.hhs.gov. It's right there. You can download the spreadsheet.
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:36.840]  It's, oh, here's how many children had seizures and were put into comas and how many children were
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:41.960]  killed by vaccines in the last quarter. And it's widely believed that those numbers represent only
[03:08:41.960 --> 03:08:48.680]  from 1-tenth to 1-100 of the real numbers of children in America that are harmed and killed
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:53.960]  every year by vaccines. So anyone who says the vaccines don't harm anyone is just ignorant,
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:09:01.800]  like AOC level ignorant. You can't be more ignorant about vaccines than saying something like,
[03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:10.200]  oh, vaccines don't harm anyone. That's totally ignorant. So the Association of American Physicians
[03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:17.240]  and Surgeons says, guess what? Strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions,
[03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:21.960]  including mandated vaccines. Gonna read you some of the bombshell highlights from their
[03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:26.840]  announcements. And then we're going to go into why some second amendment groups are pushing vaccines
[03:09:26.840 --> 03:09:32.840]  now essentially at gunpoint, which is insane. But back to the AAPS statement. Quote, governmental
[03:09:32.840 --> 03:09:38.360]  preemption of patients or parents' decisions about accepting drugs or other medical interventions
[03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:46.200]  is a serious intrusion into individual liberty, autonomy, and parental decisions about child
[03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:53.720]  rearing. I read that. I was like, wow. Finally, a doctor's group is talking about liberty instead
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:10:00.680]  of medical tyranny. Because you know, the vaccine industry has devolved into this fanaticism medical
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:08.680]  cult of like vaccine jihadists who are, you know, like they would wear suicide bombing vests as
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:13.080]  doctors just to run into a group of anti-vaxxers and pull the cord and detonate and kill as many
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:18.200]  anti-vaxxers as they could. They're that crazy now. They're totally insane. They want to penetrate
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:26.040]  your body at gunpoint with proven dangerous toxins, toxic ingredients, adjuvants, aluminum, mercury,
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:32.120]  formaldehyde, MSG, antibiotics, aborted human fetal cells. We're talking about dead babies
[03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:39.000]  that are in the vaccines that are put into your children. Whoa. What did I just say? Yeah,
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:45.160]  dead babies, okay, aborted baby tissue is put into the vaccines. If you don't believe me,
[03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:50.600]  I just published an article on natural news. I think it was yesterday and I've also linked to it
[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:57.400]  today. But yesterday's article, let's see, it was about the genetic sequencing science breakthrough
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:03.000]  just proved that measles outbreaks are caused by the measles vaccine. In that article, I linked to
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:11.880]  the CDC. I linked to the CDC website that admits aborted human fetal tissue cells are used in
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:19.640]  vaccines. And guess what? Guess what? One of those cell lines was taken from a murdered
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:27.800]  baby from a psychiatric patient mother. So she was in some kind of psych treatment
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:33.720]  and they aborted the baby. They grabbed those baby tissues and then they used that to keep
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:39.320]  making more and more vaccines so that they're injecting your children with dead baby tissue.
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:44.200]  It's true. The CDC openly admits it. And people who don't know this are just ignorant.
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:47.480]  They're just medically illiterate, frankly. They don't know what they're talking about.
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:51.960]  They don't even know what they don't know about this. All right, but back to the statement from
[03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:57.720]  the APS, quote, there are no rigorous safety studies of sufficient power to rule out a much
[03:11:57.720 --> 03:12:04.120]  higher risk of complications for vaccines. There are no studies that use an unvaccinated control
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:11.400]  group. There's no honest placebo group. What the vaccine industry does is they trick the clinical
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:17.000]  trials. They take all the toxic ingredients of a vaccine, the adjuvants, the aluminum, the mercury,
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:21.800]  all these other things, and they call that a placebo. And they inject both groups with all
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:27.960]  these toxins and then all the negative effects, all the seizures, all the comas, all the deaths
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:33.960]  cancel each other out. And they say, look, vaccines don't cause seizures. It's all fraudulent junk
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:39.960]  science. It's a trick. And we're exposing it every day here in the alternative media. That's
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:45.560]  why people know this is the only place to get this truth. All right, the APS, I'm going to wrap
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:50.280]  this up for their statement, but they go on to say that the smallpox vaccine is so dangerous,
[03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:55.720]  you can't even get it now. There are reports of severe permanent brain damage from other
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:13:01.080]  vaccines, including the bird flu vaccine. And they say there are complications that have followed
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:07.080]  MMR vaccination and are even listed in the manufacturer's packaging insert. So right on
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:12.680]  the vaccine insert sheet itself, it says these vaccines cause all these serious complications.
[03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:16.840]  And we've done stories and Infowars has done stories on that before that show some of those
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:23.880]  insert sheets, enormous conflicts of interest in the vaccine industry, suppression of research of
[03:13:23.880 --> 03:13:29.640]  scientists who dare to speak out against the toxic effects of vaccines. All of these things are
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:35.800]  mentioned by the AAPS. And also, you know what? Senator Rand Paul has come out on this issue
[03:13:35.800 --> 03:13:43.880]  as well. Rand Paul says mandatory vaccines are the wrong policy. Rand Paul is a physician
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:49.560]  medically trained. Rand Paul is pro vaccine in the general sense. I think he said that he
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:56.040]  vaccinate his own children. I doubt he uses all the multi dose vaccine vials. If he knows anything,
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:14:00.840]  he'll use single dose vials without the mercury. But I don't know for sure how he
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:06.920]  vaccinates his children. The point is even Rand Paul, who is essentially pro vaccine says
[03:14:06.920 --> 03:14:15.560]  mandatory vaccines are a bad policy, a dangerous policy. Now, here's where this gets twisted.
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:23.560]  Now we've got pro second amendment publishers that are pushing vaccine propaganda. One publisher
[03:14:23.560 --> 03:14:29.320]  Amoland, Amoland.com, which has been a very reliable pro second amendment pro individual
[03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:36.440]  Liberty publisher. Today they put out this vaccine propaganda cartoon by a cartoonist named Michael P.
[03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:43.160]  Ramirez, where they're pushing vaccines. They're pushing the measles vaccines and they're mocking
[03:14:43.160 --> 03:14:47.720]  people who don't want their children vaccinated. And it's like, what is wrong with you people?
[03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:52.760]  Don't you realize that now you are just like a leftist listening to gun people talk about
[03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:57.080]  vaccines when they don't know what they're talking about? It's just like listening to a liberal
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:01.880]  talk about Glocks when they don't know how Glocks work like they'll tweet out. Oh, we just discovered
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:08.360]  that Glocks fire bullets when the trigger is pulled. Really? That's amazing. And that's what it
[03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:13.480]  sounds like when you have these pro second amendment groups pushing vaccines. They don't know anything
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:18.440]  about vaccines. You're falling for the leftist agenda. You're falling for the globalist agenda.
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:23.480]  What? You want the government to come in at gunpoint and vaccinate your children, penetrate
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:27.720]  the bodies of your children while you proclaim to be pro liberty because you support gun rights?
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:33.560]  People second amendment exists to protect you and your family against assaults with a deadly
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:38.760]  weapon, which includes deadly vaccines administered at gunpoint against your will. That is a deadly
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:45.640]  weapon. It's a medical weapon. Why do you think the second amendment exists? It's you need to
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:49.480]  get your head straight on this issue. I'll be back with more. This is Mike Adams here on the Alice

[03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:04.840]  or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know I spend hours in front
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:10.280]  of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day. But thanks to supermail vitality

[03:19:57.560 --> 03:20:00.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:00.280 --> 03:20:21.000]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams.
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:29.080]  I was thinking about these these second amendment defenders who are now pushing
[03:20:29.080 --> 03:20:35.080]  vaccine propaganda. And this idea just came to me on the break. Someone needs to make a meme.
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:40.280]  All right. So all of you awesome meme creators out there pay attention. Here's the meme.
[03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:44.840]  I just have the text for it. You can find the right image. But the top of the text is
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:51.800]  you can't take my guns. And then the bottom is but you can have my children because that's
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:56.600]  what these people are doing. They're like government get your hands off our guns. But here
[03:20:56.600 --> 03:21:01.720]  you can have our kids. You can have our homeschooled kids. You can have our our children in public
[03:21:01.720 --> 03:21:06.520]  schools. Just take the kids shoot them up with whatever you want because oh yeah we trust you
[03:21:06.520 --> 03:21:12.040]  the government. We trust you the CDC. We trust big pharma. Yeah. Even though the vaccine industry
[03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:16.440]  has absolute legal immunity which means they have no incentive for quality control whatsoever.
[03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:21.800]  And the vaccine insert sheets themselves basically say yeah this can kill you or this can cause
[03:21:21.800 --> 03:21:26.600]  severe harm and neurological damage. And the government publishes statistics every quarter
[03:21:26.600 --> 03:21:31.960]  about how many children are killed by vaccines. But somehow some of these pro-second amendment
[03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:38.600]  people who still don't get it are out there like Amoland that I mentioned. You know if you contact
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:42.200]  Amoland be polite. They're good people. I'm not saying they're bad people. They're good on the
[03:21:42.200 --> 03:21:47.960]  second amendment. But you need to have liberty to be universal. If you if you don't want the
[03:21:47.960 --> 03:21:53.000]  government to bust into your house and take your guns why would you want the government to bust
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:58.120]  into your house and take your children and vaccinate them against your will as a parent. It
[03:21:58.120 --> 03:22:03.400]  doesn't make any sense. And of course it's the radical left that is pushing all of these agendas.
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:09.480]  They want to take your guns. Gun confiscation is now openly pushed. They want to forcibly vaccinate
[03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:15.880]  your children against your wishes. There's a there's a law that's being debated. I think it's in
[03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:21.640]  Iowa. I'd have to check that but where they would actually have armed vaccine squads go door to door
[03:22:22.600 --> 03:22:28.600]  to break into your homes hold parents at gunpoint and essentially force the children to be vaccinated
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:33.160]  essentially at gunpoint. That's actually being debated now. These are the same leftists that
[03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:39.240]  are now pro infanticide. So of course they they murder children and they celebrate it. This is
[03:22:39.240 --> 03:22:44.760]  the new law in New York and in Vermont I believe and other places now infanticide.
[03:22:44.760 --> 03:22:50.760]  This is what they want. And then they claim oh we we love the children at least the ones that we
[03:22:50.760 --> 03:22:57.800]  don't kill at birth. We love the the surviving children so much that we want to just vaccinate
[03:22:57.800 --> 03:23:01.880]  them for their own good. You know what that sounds like sounds like the gun control argument. Oh we
[03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:07.080]  need to take your guns for the greater good. Right. This is what you hear from leftists all
[03:23:07.080 --> 03:23:11.320]  the time. Oh you can't be allowed to make your own decision on self defense. The government will
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:16.200]  the government will defend you against crime. You don't need a gun. Just dial 911 and pray
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:24.680]  and wait 37 hours in Chicago for a police officer to show up. This is what they're doing. So look
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:29.400]  my message to all these people and all these these political cartoonists like Michael P.
[03:23:29.400 --> 03:23:33.960]  Ramirez who who is a pro liberty cartoonist who's pushed with his vaccine propaganda.
[03:23:33.960 --> 03:23:40.200]  My message is very simple. If you believe in liberty apply it universally. If you think the
[03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:44.360]  government should get out of your gun rights. The government should get out of your your your
[03:23:44.360 --> 03:23:48.840]  health freedom as well. The government should not tell you that you have to take chemotherapy
[03:23:48.840 --> 03:23:53.640]  or that you have to surrender your children to the government thugs the medical kidnappers
[03:23:53.640 --> 03:23:58.920]  who take children away to be forcibly injected and forcibly drip with chemotherapy drugs.
[03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:04.040]  Get the government out of our lives in every area. Don't just take one area and then
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:08.920]  in like oh you're you're against gun confiscation but you love globalism in every other way.
[03:24:08.920 --> 03:24:15.400]  What what's wrong with you. Get your head on straight. I mean what why do we have to teach
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:22.600]  liberty to pro second amendment people. Don't you get it. It's universal. It's universal liberty
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:26.680]  and I apologize if I if I sound a little steamed on this but you know what.
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:33.480]  I you know this that's what this show is all about. That's what independent media is all about.
[03:24:33.480 --> 03:24:40.600]  We are principled people. We have principles. We don't just choose which areas of liberty to
[03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:46.840]  ignore. We are pro liberty on all the areas of liberty. We're like hey you want to you want
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:52.760]  to manufacture your own gun. Where it's legal you know using a ghost gunner or using your work
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:57.640]  bench or whatever. That's your right. Government has no business to tell you that you want to buy
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:25:02.280]  or grow your own food. Government has no right to tell you that you can't have a home garden.
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:08.360]  You want to educate your own kids. Home schooling. Government has no right to come in and force you
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:15.160]  to push public school propaganda on those kids. Liberty must be universal or it's pointless
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:18.920]  because the government will try to invade your life in every area. They're not going to stop with
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:23.400]  guns. They're not going to stop with vaccines. They're not going to stop with pushing pesticides
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:27.000]  into the food supply. They're not going to stop with trying to outlaw home schooling.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:31.960]  They're not going to stop with the tech giants. They're not going to stop with the censorship
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:37.640]  of Alex Jones. Now they're censoring content about anti-cancer foods. Now they're censoring content
[03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:42.520]  that questions vaccines. Next they're going to be censoring content about nutrition.
[03:25:43.080 --> 03:25:46.680]  This is going to be a day soon where you go on to Facebook and you try to post oh
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:51.480]  vitamin C prevents scurvy and Facebook is going to say you're banned. That's hate speech.
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:26:00.280]  How's that hate speech? Well it's not approved by the FDA or you know I mean you pick anything.
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:06.840]  Any nutrient. Vitamin D prevents rickets. Well of course it does. That's been known for hundreds
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:11.160]  of years but if you go somewhere and say that Google's going to ban you. YouTube's going to ban
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:18.120]  you. Why? Because you people you sat back and you did nothing. You did nothing while they steamrolled
[03:26:18.120 --> 03:26:23.080]  all your rights. They took away all your liberties and you only picked and choose the one liberty
[03:26:23.080 --> 03:26:27.080]  that you were going to defend. I'm going to hold onto my guns. But what? Let them take your speech.
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:31.000]  Let them take your children. Let them take your home garden. Let them take your home school.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:37.240]  Let them take your body against your will. Really? What are you fighting for? If not for universal
[03:26:37.240 --> 03:26:43.640]  liberty. You understand? It's universal. The right to speak. The right to worship. The right to
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:49.960]  express religion. The right to peaceably assemble. The right to keep and bear arms. The right to raise
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:55.400]  your own children with your decisions as a parent. To decide what goes into that child's body in
[03:26:55.400 --> 03:27:00.920]  terms of food and medicine and what is rejected. Such as chemotherapy and vaccines and GMOs and
[03:27:00.920 --> 03:27:07.960]  pesticides and anything else that you decide as a parent. Don't fear call yourself pro-liberty
[03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:14.280]  unless you believe in universal liberty. That's my point. And yeah, I feel pretty passionate about this.
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:25.480]  All right. I'm not trying to mimic Alex Jones here, by the way. I just feel
[03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:31.000]  it feels like an Alex Jones moment of just outrage. Just to say the truth. Just to say
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:36.120]  what's obvious. Just like Alex was speaking out against infanticide, you know, on the Joe Rogan
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:41.240]  show and he's jumping up and down and he's screaming and he's cursing. That's the appropriate response,
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:48.600]  people. I looked at that and I said, yes, Alex. Yes, that is exactly the correct response. Everybody
[03:27:48.600 --> 03:27:53.720]  in America should be jumping up and down and screaming and cursing about killing the killing
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:59.880]  of babies. The murdering of babies in our country. And I'm tired of people saying, well, I want to
[03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:05.480]  be polite. I want to get along with everybody. Really? Let me tell you something. These left-wing
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:09.560]  tyrants, they're not interested in getting along with you. They're not interested in negotiating
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:14.040]  with you. They're not interested in coexistence. They'll put a bumper sticker on their car. They
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:18.680]  don't mean it. They want to murder you. They want to murder Christians. They want to kill Trump
[03:28:18.680 --> 03:28:22.520]  supporters. They want to kill their own babies. You think they don't want to kill yours too? Of
[03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:27.080]  course they do. These people are not tolerant. These people are not inclusive. They are the
[03:28:27.080 --> 03:28:34.760]  enemy of humanity. Stop trying to appease them. Stop trying to make the tyrants happy.
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:40.760]  Stand up and be an American, for God's sake. Be a man. Be a woman. Have courage. Have some
[03:28:40.760 --> 03:28:45.880]  backbone. Stand up for something that matters. Stop giving in to this tyranny and medicine
[03:28:45.880 --> 03:28:51.080]  and politics and speech. Stop giving in. Stand up. Take a stand. It's about damn time.

[03:33:15.800 --> 03:33:21.960]  War, it's Alex Jones. And now your host, Mike Adams.
[03:33:24.600 --> 03:33:31.240]  All right, I got to change the topics here for a minute because I think if I keep talking about
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:37.960]  these vaccine mandates, I'm just going to be even more enraged here. So let me switch the focus
[03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:43.400]  here for a minute. There's a civil war scenario that you need to know about. There are 12 states
[03:33:43.400 --> 03:33:50.120]  now that have signed on to this, what's called this National Popular Vote Compact. What it says
[03:33:50.120 --> 03:33:55.640]  is you know how the electoral college got Trump elected because the electoral college reflects
[03:33:55.640 --> 03:34:01.240]  the popular vote within each state. And the purpose of the electoral college was to actually,
[03:34:01.240 --> 03:34:07.400]  so that we could have a constitutional republic and not a mobocracy, where just the popular votes
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:11.800]  from the big cities and the big California and New York would determine everything.
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:16.040]  We need to represent all the states in America. So we have an electoral college that actually
[03:34:16.040 --> 03:34:22.680]  gives more weight to the individual votes in states like Wyoming compared to the mob votes
[03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:29.240]  of illegal aliens in California. Thank goodness. But of course, the left is totally enraged about
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:34.600]  the fact that the electoral college doesn't vote the way they want it to be. So they've created
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:39.640]  this popular vote pact. 12 states have signed on to it. Colorado most recently,
[03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:46.920]  but the governor just signed it into law. What this says is that if there are a total of 270
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:53.240]  electoral votes in terms of participation of states, and if the popular vote, i.e. the Hillary
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:35:01.800]  Clinton vote, exceeds the other candidate which wins the electoral vote, then all of these states
[03:35:01.800 --> 03:35:06.920]  are going to switch their electoral votes to the popular vote candidate. In other words,
[03:35:06.920 --> 03:35:11.960]  if this were in place in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have won and states like Colorado would have
[03:35:11.960 --> 03:35:20.840]  betrayed their own voters. So voters in Colorado and Oregon and Washington state and other places
[03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:25.320]  where this is being pushed and in some cases signed into law, your votes are going to be
[03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:32.360]  outweighed now by the votes of illegal aliens in California and New York and other liberal states.
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:37.560]  Now the Civil War scenario is as follows. 2020 election, what if we have a repeat of the same
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:44.040]  thing that happened in 2016 where President Trump wins the electoral college, but there's a Democrat
[03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:49.560]  candidate, let's say it's Hillary Clinton, maybe Joe Biden, who knows, who wins the popular vote
[03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:55.560]  because of course Democrats have managed to whip up enough vote fraud and illegal aliens voting
[03:35:55.560 --> 03:36:00.040]  in places like California and elsewhere so that they have a popular vote. In this case,
[03:36:00.040 --> 03:36:04.440]  these states that have signed out of this pact would switch their votes to the Democrat candidate.
[03:36:04.440 --> 03:36:10.920]  Now then the Democrats would announce we won, but the conservatives would say no, no, no, no,
[03:36:10.920 --> 03:36:16.280]  we won. We won the electoral college vote. We won the presidency. The Democrats would say no, no,
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:21.160]  no, no, we won because of this new law. What do you have there? Now you have a real split.
[03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:28.520]  Now you have both sides thinking the other side is completely illegitimate and it should be
[03:36:28.520 --> 03:36:34.840]  leading the country. This situation can happen and we're actually building toward that happening
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:43.000]  and this situation could lead to outright civil war as each side attempts to assert its authority
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:48.360]  over Washington D.C. So I could see 10,000 armed patriots going to Washington D.C. to say no,
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:52.760]  we're going to defend our constitution, defend our republic, defend our president. I can see
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:37:00.280]  that happening. Meanwhile, the left is going to send 10,000 anti-fa armed anti-fa with
[03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:06.280]  baseball bats and spikes or something to Washington D.C. to just start slaughtering people,
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:10.760]  murdering people. Maybe they'll bring their own babies along so they can commit infanticide,
[03:37:10.760 --> 03:37:15.320]  which they love to do anyway, right there in the streets to celebrate their philosophy,
[03:37:15.320 --> 03:37:20.760]  the philosophy of death. The left is a death cult. So you're going to have this, I can see this
[03:37:20.760 --> 03:37:26.360]  happening not only in Virginia and Washington D.C., but other places around the country. Now,
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:32.200]  it's not hard to figure out. And by the way, I want to say here, I do not endorse initiating
[03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:38.040]  any kind of violence if such a scenario were to occur. Our job as responsible gun owners,
[03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:43.000]  people who abide by the law and people who are working to defend our republic against lawlessness,
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:49.080]  our job is to only fire in self-defense, in defense. We don't initiate violence, we stop violence.
[03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:56.200]  But if violence is initiated by the left in that scenario, i.e. anti-fa left-wing terrorists,
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:38:01.560]  I don't know, a million Obama followers who have been brainwashed into a zombie-like assault wave,
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:09.400]  that battle is going to be over very quickly because the patriots obviously know how to
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:14.360]  defend themselves better than people on the left. But that is a very real event that may happen.
[03:38:14.360 --> 03:38:22.040]  Another event, people, I actually, another journalist was asking me recently in a private
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:28.920]  conversation, asking me, why isn't Trump releasing the FISA warrant documents? Why isn't Trump just
[03:38:28.920 --> 03:38:34.200]  dumping the deep state truth out there and exposing everything about Rod Rosenstein and
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:38.280]  James Comey and the abuse of power, the Robert Mueller investigation, everything?
[03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:42.600]  A couple of answers on that that you may not have thought of. The obvious answer is, oh,
[03:38:42.600 --> 03:38:48.520]  he's waiting for the Mueller report to drop so that he can then dump these documents and contradict
[03:38:48.520 --> 03:38:51.960]  whatever propaganda is in the Mueller report. Well, that could be happening any day now.
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:59.560]  But the other theory is that President Trump is waiting for his second term, because he still
[03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:05.560]  needs to get elected, re-elected for the second term. He still needs a base of support in
[03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:12.360]  conservatism. He still needs some amount of the conservative establishment to continue
[03:39:12.360 --> 03:39:18.840]  supporting him as president. So he can't go full on anti-deep state right yet.
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:23.400]  He could do it if he wins the second term and he doesn't need to be re-elected,
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:27.240]  but he could also do it, and this is what you may not have thought of, he could also do it if he
[03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:33.240]  loses the 2020 election. Remember, the election happens in November, but the new president wouldn't
[03:39:33.240 --> 03:39:41.320]  be sworn in until January. If you go back to 2016 slash 2017, Obama used that period to sign a whole
[03:39:41.320 --> 03:39:47.560]  slew of laws and regulations and executive orders that allowed the deep state to start sharing
[03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:54.520]  intelligence information that was illegally gathered on President Trump and his campaign
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:40:00.200]  managers and his business associates. And that became part of the deep state investigation,
[03:40:00.200 --> 03:40:07.480]  the Russia collusion hoax into a current modern-day President Trump. But Trump, if he were to lose the
[03:40:07.480 --> 03:40:13.640]  2020 election, which I don't think will happen, but if he were, he would have two months to dump
[03:40:13.640 --> 03:40:22.440]  every deep state secret imaginable. He could just go full out. Because the president can
[03:40:22.440 --> 03:40:27.800]  declassify anything. So he could declassify, hear the secrets on Hillary Clinton and the
[03:40:27.800 --> 03:40:33.400]  Clinton Foundation, hear the secrets on the corrupt FBI leaders like James Comey and Peter
[03:40:33.400 --> 03:40:40.760]  Strock. Here's the truth about Robert Mueller. Here's the FISA warrant illegal acts that took
[03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:48.040]  place. Here's the British intelligence people who conspired through back channels, conspired with
[03:40:48.040 --> 03:40:52.600]  the Democrat deep state in America to try to overthrow a presidency. Here's proof of the coup.
[03:40:53.720 --> 03:40:59.480]  So depending on what happens in the 2020 election, we could be seeing Trump going full
[03:40:59.480 --> 03:41:05.640]  nuclear. I don't mean that literally. I mean, like dumping all this information because he's
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:11.000]  on his way out anyway. So keep that in mind. Now, one more note about the 2020 election.
[03:41:11.960 --> 03:41:16.920]  Slightly different topic. You notice how Democrats are fighting the citizenship question
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:21.880]  on the national census. What is this all about? Something you need to keep in mind is that the
[03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:29.080]  census determines how many members of the House that each state is granted based on the proportion
[03:41:29.080 --> 03:41:34.520]  of its population compared to the national population. So the more that California can inflate
[03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:40.760]  its population with illegals, the more seats California gets in the House of Representatives.
[03:41:41.560 --> 03:41:48.760]  And since California is allowing illegals to vote for senators and to vote for members of Congress,
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:57.320]  we are being overrun nationally by California's insurrection by California's lawlessness and
[03:41:57.320 --> 03:42:04.360]  California's willingness to violate the rule of law and allow illegals to be counted in the
[03:42:04.360 --> 03:42:12.440]  census and to vote in federal elections. This is why we must have a national voter ID law in place.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:19.320]  We must have free speech restored very quickly so that we can have an open debate before the 2020
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:23.880]  election. And most importantly, as Stuart Rhodes said from Oathkeepers, and I agree with him,
[03:42:23.880 --> 03:42:27.960]  the leaders of California, the political leaders who are carrying this out,
[03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:35.080]  they are engaged in open insurrection. They must be arrested, criminally charged, indicted and
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:39.960]  prosecuted for their open insurrection against the United States of America. That is what needs
[03:42:39.960 --> 03:42:44.760]  to happen right now. Trump needs to get it done. Of course, straight ahead here on the Alex Jones
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:54.440]  show, Mike Adams, going in. We'll be back after this. I've got some really good news, though.

[03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:16.200]  another Deep Breath Crystal source, but I thought at the other two types of iodine, the scientists
[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:21.400]  that do that, it sold a lot that people want original X2. I was resigned the fact we didn't
[03:43:21.400 --> 03:43:26.840]  have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again at infowarstore.com,
[03:43:26.840 --> 03:43:33.080]  so hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months. We have now had the same company,
[03:43:33.080 --> 03:43:40.280]  the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.

[03:47:07.240 --> 03:47:13.800]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:37.240 --> 03:47:54.840]  You're not going to be censored there for being a patriot, for being an American, for having
[03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:59.240]  gun videos. You're not going to be censored there for quoting scripture. You're not going to be
[03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:03.960]  censored there for saying there are only two genders. You could speak on these issues
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:11.080]  at Brighton.com. We haven't yet broken even there, but we're working on a new infrastructure change
[03:48:11.080 --> 03:48:17.000]  to reduce our storage costs. It's going to be breakeven by April, and then we'll be able to
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:24.360]  keep expanding it. Continue to support all the alternative platforms, infowars, Brighton,
[03:48:24.360 --> 03:48:29.800]  independent publishers, independent video sites, independent social media. Get off the mainstream
[03:48:29.800 --> 03:48:36.440]  platforms. Get off of Facebook. Get off of Google. Use DuckDuckGo or something different.
[03:48:36.440 --> 03:48:43.560]  You've got to use alternatives for this. All right. Now, a couple other things. Women's sports
[03:48:43.560 --> 03:48:50.760]  are being decimated, of course, by the transgender movement. The LGBT push is destroying women's
[03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:56.840]  sports to the point where now the Olympics is saying that biological men can compete as women
[03:48:56.840 --> 03:49:02.600]  if they just say they're women. Now, this is apparently supposed to be a pro-feminism position.
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:08.440]  So if you want to destroy all women's sports and destroy all the records that women had,
[03:49:09.080 --> 03:49:14.360]  think about all the amazing women who spent their lives to be amazing athletes, and they
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:18.920]  have records in the long jump, and they have records in sprinting, and they have records in
[03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:23.320]  every sport you could imagine. All those records are going to be blown away. There won't be any
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:28.760]  more women in the Olympics if this continues. You're just going to have two, just two branches
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:32.040]  of the Olympics. You're going to have men's sports, and then you're going to have,
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:37.880]  you know, girly men's sports. You're going to have men in men's sports. You're going to have men
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:44.440]  in women's sports, men who claim to be women. How is that feminist? How is that supporting
[03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:51.160]  women's rights? That's insane. The reason that men and women are on different teams, I mean,
[03:49:51.160 --> 03:49:56.840]  different competitions is because men and women are biologically different. And if you didn't have
[03:49:56.840 --> 03:50:03.400]  women segregated in their own sports, then there would be no women, virtually, that would win
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:10.600]  anything. You're not going to outrun the men if you're a woman sprinter. You have to compete with
[03:50:10.600 --> 03:50:14.600]  other women. That's the only way you have a chance. It's not to say that women don't have
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:20.840]  other advantages over men. Women do. Women have better, among other things, intuition, better
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:28.360]  nurturing skills. Women have better ability for social interaction. Women are smarter when it comes
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:36.120]  to friends and family. Men are just physically stronger and tend to be better at video games
[03:50:36.120 --> 03:50:42.040]  and things like that. Men and women are different, biologically different, obviously. And that's why
[03:50:42.040 --> 03:50:47.640]  you have to have different competitions in the Olympics. But I guess the feminists don't care
[03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:52.760]  about women anymore. That's the big upshot from this. It's just insane. Here's another piece of
[03:50:52.760 --> 03:50:59.080]  news. Recycling. So China has stopped buying all the recycled materials that are coming out of these
[03:50:59.080 --> 03:51:04.520]  liberal, progressive cities where people, dutifully, let's separate the plastic and let's
[03:51:04.520 --> 03:51:10.360]  separate the aluminum and let's separate the paper. And they do their duty and they separate
[03:51:10.360 --> 03:51:14.040]  all into these little bins and then these little bins get collected by the cities. And then,
[03:51:14.040 --> 03:51:19.160]  then, since China's not buying it anymore, these cities just incinerate everything. They're just
[03:51:19.160 --> 03:51:25.000]  burning plastic now. So I don't know what the point is of recycling. And this is being reported
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:30.600]  all over the mainstream media now, by the way. I'm not just citing this out of the blue. I think
[03:51:30.600 --> 03:51:37.880]  Wall Street Journal reported on this recently. The progressivism of recycling has turned into
[03:51:37.880 --> 03:51:44.680]  mass plastics incineration and pollution. So this is the reality of the Green New Deal.
[03:51:44.680 --> 03:51:48.680]  You know, we have this incredible vision. What if we all just recycled everything and we'd have
[03:51:48.680 --> 03:51:55.800]  all this amazing, clean world? That's the utopia. That's the vision. That's the promise. That's the
[03:51:55.800 --> 03:52:03.720]  fire festival of ecological environmentalism. But in reality, you're just burning plastic bottles.
[03:52:03.720 --> 03:52:08.440]  You're just, like, billowing black smoke into the sky and polluting farmlands and polluting
[03:52:08.440 --> 03:52:13.960]  communities and creating smog and toxins and causing cancer in nearby communities. That's
[03:52:13.960 --> 03:52:24.200]  the reality of what's happening. I mean, recycling has become a joke, just like everything that these
[03:52:24.200 --> 03:52:29.640]  leftists push. I mean, they push massive solar farms. Let's have 100,000 acres of solar farms.
[03:52:29.640 --> 03:52:34.840]  Well, where are you going to get the rare earth metals to make the solar panels? All these minerals
[03:52:34.840 --> 03:52:40.120]  that go into the solar panels. Where are you going to get those? Oh, we have these really dirty
[03:52:40.120 --> 03:52:45.560]  child slave mining operations in third world countries. But don't tell anybody about that.
[03:52:46.760 --> 03:52:52.040]  Because those minerals are necessary for wind turbines and they're necessary for solar panels.
[03:52:52.040 --> 03:52:57.400]  So you have all these dirty operations, child slave operations all over the world,
[03:52:57.400 --> 03:53:02.440]  destroying the environment in places like China or India or elsewhere or South America, for that
[03:53:02.440 --> 03:53:07.960]  matter, for certain minerals to get these minerals to make all these green products. Yeah. Oh, it's
[03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:15.160]  so green. It's so green. We have green clean energy here. Oh, what's that smoke in the distance? Oh,
[03:53:15.160 --> 03:53:18.920]  don't worry. They're just burning all the plastic bottles next door because that's progressive.
[03:53:19.560 --> 03:53:23.960]  Don't worry. Women can't compete in the Olympics anymore because that's progressive too. All the
[03:53:23.960 --> 03:53:30.280]  sports records are blown away by biological men pretending to be women. And don't worry about
[03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:36.680]  the child slave mines for rare minerals in Asia. You don't see them. So they don't really matter
[03:53:36.680 --> 03:53:43.240]  to the greenie weenies here in the United States and the Ocasio Cortez Green New Deal, which is
[03:53:44.120 --> 03:53:50.680]  again, the fire festival of utopia, of liberal utopia. So that's it now. I mean,
[03:53:50.680 --> 03:53:55.640]  there's just recycling is now you might as well. If you're going to do the same thing that a city
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:53:59.880]  did, you just collect all your plastic bottles. And I'm not recommending you do this, but this is
[03:53:59.880 --> 03:54:03.160]  what they're doing. What if you collected all your plastic bottles, threw them into a metal
[03:54:03.720 --> 03:54:08.920]  barrel and just lit them up in your backyard? That would be the same thing that cities are doing.
[03:54:08.920 --> 03:54:16.120]  They're just burning them. I mean, this is, this is the 1800s. Now, this is, I mean, even
[03:54:16.120 --> 03:54:21.800]  my grandparents, they had a farm. I remember they would just burn their trash. And it was like,
[03:54:21.800 --> 03:54:25.720]  well, you just burn your trash out here. I was shocked by that as a kid when I saw that. It's
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:29.880]  like, oh, here's a here's a giant barrel. You just set in fire to it. That's interesting. I'd never
[03:54:29.880 --> 03:54:33.720]  seen that before because I grew up in the suburbs, you know, we had a trash truck come pick up the
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:39.480]  trash, but now cities are just going back to just just burn it, burn it all. They don't care what
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:44.280]  they release into the atmosphere, heavy metals, you know, computer parts, you burn those mother
[03:54:44.280 --> 03:54:50.120]  boards and those video graphics cards. Guess what? You release mercury, you release toxic levels of
[03:54:50.120 --> 03:54:54.920]  copper into the air, you release all these toxins, all of these heavy metals, you release lead
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:55:01.160]  into the air. They don't care. It's in the name of utopia. It's all green now. So if you just burn
[03:55:01.160 --> 03:55:07.880]  toxic trash, that's green. And that doesn't even count, you know, the $93 trillion green new deal,
[03:55:07.880 --> 03:55:14.120]  which would of course collapse combustion engines or just outlaw all tractors. There goes the food
[03:55:14.120 --> 03:55:19.960]  supply, just outlaw trucks on the highway. There goes Walmart. No more products at Walmart. You
[03:55:19.960 --> 03:55:27.080]  know, how about let's let's tell Ocasio Cortez before trying this incredible experiment on the
[03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:32.280]  entire country. Why don't they just do the green new deal in New York only? How about that? Since
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:37.080]  since that's where Ocasio Cortez is from, how about just Manhattan Island? Just have a green new deal
[03:55:37.080 --> 03:55:45.560]  in one state or one area, just ban airplanes, shut down, you know, the JFK airport, shut down
[03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:52.280]  all cars, just just shut down and no trucks can deliver food to New York. Just just have trains
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:57.800]  going everywhere. Let them start building train tracks across the Atlantic to London, since a
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:03.240]  lot of people fly to London from New York to see see how that goes. Let's just try it one place
[03:56:03.240 --> 03:56:08.680]  first. You know, before you you apply your idiocy to the entire country, how about you try it where
[03:56:08.680 --> 03:56:15.800]  you live first? And oh yeah, no more beef for you, Ocasio Cortez, no more hamburgers, no more steak,
[03:56:15.800 --> 03:56:20.760]  no more animal products, even though, you know, your staffers are caught eating burgers all the
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:26.680]  time. You can't have that. Let's have an embargo on meat products to New York state, because they
[03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:33.000]  want to try the green new deal. Again, the fire festival of environmentalism. This is what they
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:39.560]  want. Let's let them live in it. You see, this is the key of socialism. Socialists are wealthy
[03:56:39.560 --> 03:56:47.640]  elitists who want you to live in their nightmares while they live as parasites off of your productivity,
[03:56:47.640 --> 03:56:52.200]  but they never want to live in their own nightmares. They create these artificial cities
[03:56:52.200 --> 03:56:59.000]  extracting your wealth, your money, taking away your freedom so they can live like kings and queens,
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:04.920]  but they never have to be subjected to the atrocious laws that they subject you to,
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:09.320]  which is why Al Gore flies around on airplanes, private jets all over the world complaining
[03:57:09.320 --> 03:57:16.600]  about fossil fuel emissions, and global warming. But there you go. This is the ultimate hypocrisy,
[03:57:16.600 --> 03:57:21.240]  the ultimate contradiction of socialism. That's why socialism sucks. That's why we should all
[03:57:21.240 --> 03:57:28.520]  vote against it forever. I say abolish socialism, reject the green new deal, and fight for liberty.
[03:57:29.160 --> 03:57:33.080]  Fight for making America great again. That's why I'm wearing this shirt today. Thank you
[03:57:33.080 --> 03:57:37.000]  for joining me today. This is Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones show. Thanks for tuning in.
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:52.040]  Share these videos everywhere and help fight for America. Take care.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:12.920]  For heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH, what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[03:58:12.920 --> 03:58:18.120]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our
[03:58:18.120 --> 03:58:23.640]  Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:30.360]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure
[03:58:30.360 --> 03:58:36.600]  raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[03:58:36.600 --> 03:58:42.280]  a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:58:44.120 --> 03:58:49.480]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue. Info wars is proud to
[03:58:49.480 --> 03:58:54.520]  sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in
