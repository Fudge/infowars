[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.400]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.400 --> 00:26.880]  Texas Alex Jones well it is surreal years ago we began talking to saw her
[00:26.880 --> 00:32.000]  some on email and he of course follows our work we follow his two times pull
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.080]  a surprise winner and he said well my big book comes out in a few years I'll come
[00:35.080 --> 00:42.440]  on well he's coming on in the third hour today on military to military is a new
[00:42.440 --> 00:45.760]  book how our own military has been standing up to the globalist trying to
[00:45.760 --> 00:49.520]  start World War three and feeding the Russians and Syrians intelligence on
[00:49.520 --> 00:53.640]  al-Qaeda al-Nusra ISIS of course this is old news to our listeners you heard it
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.080]  here first but just confirming everything we tell you is in deep research
[00:58.080 --> 01:03.720]  sometimes we make mistakes very rarely I wish I was wrong Congress is bought and
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.480]  paid for by foreign interest it's coming out of the NSA spying on them but
[01:08.480 --> 01:11.520]  that's also because there's a foreign infiltration going on it's all coming
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.360]  up but here is John Bowne's report on Congress then we'll come back after
[01:15.360 --> 01:21.600]  break the year-end disapproval polls of Congress are rolling out according to the
[01:21.600 --> 01:28.160]  latest Gallup poll 82% disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job real
[01:28.160 --> 01:35.200]  clear politics congressional job approval is at 75.8% disapproval mainstream
[01:35.200 --> 01:39.240]  media polls even have to accept the boiling anger running its course through
[01:39.240 --> 01:46.360]  America as the CNN ORC poll racks up to 75% disapproval and CBS New York Times
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.120]  is at 74% the holiday season isn't even over yet and fresh off of the heels of
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.160]  the treasonous Paul Ryan led omnibus funding of the Defense Department to
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.400]  the tune of at least two billion dollars while ignoring an enemy invasion of the
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.640]  United States meanwhile dropping a pile of cash on the sanctuary cities
[02:04.640 --> 02:08.960]  operations being flooded with non-vetted refugees a ticking time bomb
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.320]  waiting to happen all paid for by your tax dollars is it any surprise that the
[02:14.320 --> 02:18.080]  career corporate politicians that have occupied the nation's capital would
[02:18.080 --> 02:22.440]  start floating their latest bonehead idea from their arrogant bubble as if
[02:22.440 --> 02:27.480]  anybody in this country actually accepts it it seems to me that we'll have to
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.760]  borrow additional money from China in order to run this war so let's have a
[02:32.760 --> 02:38.080]  war tax now more idiotic rhetoric from the left as Democratic Senator Chris
[02:38.080 --> 02:42.880]  Coons who in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.440]  for use of military force minus the ground troops says the Congress from
[02:47.440 --> 02:51.760]  hell should now levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.960]  against the Islamic State how are we going to pay for it all the previous
[02:55.960 --> 03:00.680]  wars as he referenced before Iraq and Afghanistan had a dedicated war surtax
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.320]  and I think that's one way we could fairly pay for it with a small surtax
[03:05.320 --> 03:10.000]  that exempted active-duty military families and veterans but there's other
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.520]  ways we could pay for it we just can't keep going without even discussing it
[03:14.520 --> 03:18.520]  that's right the little boys and their brand new shiny toys over at the Pentagon
[03:18.520 --> 03:23.720]  need more of your tax dollars to fund another one of their blatant fake wars
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.480]  with an enemy they created and support maybe we should send our war tax dollars
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.520]  to Putin as he did more damaged ISIS in three days than the United States did in
[03:33.520 --> 03:39.040]  one year vocative reports the daily tab for fighting ISIS had already climbed
[03:39.040 --> 03:45.200]  more than 20% between May 21st and October 15th of this year from 9.1
[03:45.200 --> 03:50.200]  million a day to nearly 11 million per day according to the Pentagon's latest
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.280]  public figures more than half of these costs came in the form of airstrikes
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.280]  which the US has employed since August of 2014 to pound Islamic State targets
[04:00.280 --> 04:04.360]  munitions logistics and operational support accounted for the remaining
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.160]  costs according to the Pentagon despite spending billions the air campaign has
[04:09.160 --> 04:12.840]  failed to weaken the Islamic State according to intelligence officials a
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.840]  defense official told the Associated Press we've seen no meaningful
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.920]  degradation in their numbers he cited intelligence estimates that put the
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.720]  Islamic State's total strength at somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000
[04:25.720 --> 04:31.200]  virtually the same number as last August when the airstrikes began face it you
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.560]  sell out ideologue suits bumbling around the district of criminals the poll
[04:35.560 --> 04:41.840]  numbers and an average of black-budgeted 1.6 trillion in annual never-ending war

[08:35.280 --> 08:40.760]  on this Wednesday broadcast two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hirsch
[08:40.760 --> 08:46.520]  exposing what many experts have called a soft coup by the Pentagon trying to
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.360]  block the neocons and the Obama crowd from openly backing al-Qaeda groups all
[08:51.360 --> 08:57.480]  over the Middle East to bring in their Wahhabist surreal law tyranny that is in
[08:57.480 --> 09:02.880]  the third hour today former editor the editor of the Wall Street Journal former
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.320]  head of policy department of Treasury the father of Reaganomics will be popping
[09:07.320 --> 09:11.640]  in for 30 minutes as well dr. Paul Craig Roberts wrote a very important
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.800]  article dealing with the fact that Donald Trump is challenging the
[09:16.800 --> 09:22.600]  establishment and they are coming after him so that's going to be looked at
[09:22.600 --> 09:27.920]  coming up in the second hour today we'll also try to open the phones up there is
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.520]  a big daily beast article that of course is Newsweek that's getting picked up by
[09:33.520 --> 09:40.320]  the talking heads on the controlled corporate globalist press demonizing
[09:40.320 --> 09:46.480]  Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and saying how horrible it is that Matt Drudge has
[09:46.480 --> 09:51.840]  been following Donald Trump and claiming he's being supportive of Donald
[09:51.840 --> 09:57.200]  Trump well I'll let Matt Drudge speak for himself but Donald Trump looks like
[09:57.200 --> 10:02.360]  he's the only candidate that could meet Hillary Clinton and so do you want
[10:02.360 --> 10:07.000]  Hillary Clinton in office Donald Trump just gets better and better he's come
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.720]  out and said he's sick of Obama being on vacation up to four months a year worse
[10:11.720 --> 10:14.400]  than any other president for I was a big critic a bush for it
[10:14.400 --> 10:19.360]  Obama's almost a double what Bush did as he was about to go to Hawaii for another
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.560]  month-long vacation he made the announcement but oh the most important
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.760]  thing I'll be doing quote is watching the new Star Wars movie I guess the
[10:29.760 --> 10:35.280]  president gets an advanced copy or to go to the theater they're having press
[10:35.280 --> 10:42.120]  briefings with you know R2-D2 and C3PO at the White House just nothing but pop
[10:42.120 --> 10:47.960]  garbage even liberal comedians are coming out like David Spade is saying you
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.480]  know you need to not be on reality TV you need to not be so degraded as the
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.640]  president that's the whole point is to degrade the country and to divert people
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.640]  off into mindless garbage but even liberals are getting it even liberal
[11:00.640 --> 11:03.520]  members of Congress David Knight covered this yesterday are saying Hillary
[11:03.520 --> 11:08.240]  destroyed Libya launched the attack on Syria
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.760]  Obama will spend four hundred to seventy thousand dollars a day while he is in
[11:12.760 --> 11:17.440]  Hawaii on this vacation and again there's a lot bigger stuff going on but it
[11:17.440 --> 11:25.280]  illustrates as Trump said while we're in a major war with ISIS al-Qaeda al-Nusra
[11:25.280 --> 11:31.560]  same group that is attacking five or six countries or more actually it's up to 10
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.320]  but currently five or six the last month have been attacked in Africa hundreds
[11:35.320 --> 11:41.080]  dead Middle East thousands dead every month attacking Syria attacking Libya
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.520]  overthrowing it attacking and overthrowing for a time Egypt our
[11:45.520 --> 11:51.640]  government backing it this is order out of chaos this is globalism using
[11:51.640 --> 11:57.320]  America destabilize the world as well as NATO and Trump comes out and says you
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.840]  need to be at the White House fighting ISIS you need to be working hard like a
[12:02.840 --> 12:05.600]  lot of other presidents I mean Bill Clinton was a pretty bad guy doing
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.400]  horrible stuff but he reportedly worked about 15 hours a day carrying on his
[12:09.400 --> 12:15.360]  evil agenda people like Nixon worked up to 18 to 20 hours a day and by the way
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.400]  actually believed he was trying to help the country that's been well documented
[12:18.400 --> 12:25.720]  he was a twisted guy had problems but he was a saint compare a saint that's why
[12:25.720 --> 12:29.560]  the establishment took him down with a naval intelligence and a CIA officers
[12:29.560 --> 12:34.440]  over at the Washington Bilderberg post and by the way Nixon did a lot of bad
[12:34.440 --> 12:37.840]  stuff but he actually tried to be president and they said uh-huh just
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.720]  like Kennedy's tried to be president and they said no you die is what they said
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.520]  well they had a soft coup basically on Nixon and you could argue he deserved it
[12:48.520 --> 12:54.440]  he did some bad things nothing compared to what Barak is saying Obama in fact
[12:54.440 --> 13:00.800]  even Jonathan Turley other liberal constitutional lawyers have said Obama
[13:00.800 --> 13:08.000]  has done more than Bush by an order of three times three times worse three
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.680]  times worse in violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights that was
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.240]  his job put the liberals to sleep of course an attack on liberty is going
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.960]  to come from a liberal angle because traditionally American liberals were
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.680]  more like Thomas Jefferson and really did stand up for basic human rights and
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.320]  freedoms and due process that's what you could expect from the Democratic Party
[13:31.320 --> 13:38.560]  not anymore folks fascistic with a communist icing is the best way to
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.200]  describe it and they are freaking out all over the media saying it could be Matt
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.520]  drudge that gets Donald Trump elected well this is what Matt drudge is really
[13:47.520 --> 13:54.160]  able to do as the number one new site in the world to show people a mosaic of
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.440]  really what's going on linking to the establishment and what people actually
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.480]  said they'll come out and say that you know Trump said he hates all Mexicans
[14:01.480 --> 14:04.040]  and thinks they shall be deported and then drudge will just link to the actual
[14:04.040 --> 14:10.760]  clip we didn't say that so drudge just brings up things that aren't in the
[14:10.760 --> 14:15.680]  establishment narrative that don't go along with their talking points and so
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.960]  then what drudge puts out ends up becoming a major talking point because
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.720]  the slaves in mainstream media have to follow talking points they're given
[14:24.720 --> 14:28.200]  they don't even know how to come up with their own views of the world their
[14:28.200 --> 14:32.400]  own talking points they don't even see through their own rose color darkly none
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.240]  of us are perfect they just go with whatever is handed down to them that is
[14:37.240 --> 14:44.000]  the supposed angle or narrative and so they then go I mean how many times you
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.440]  see photos in the background to wash and post New York Times LA Times MSNBC CNN
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.920]  Fox News there's the drudge report on a TV screen or on computers they don't
[14:53.920 --> 14:57.040]  even know how to go through their own email or even go to like 10 or 15 other
[14:57.040 --> 15:03.480]  sites or go to foreign sites they just go to drudge which is good but but imagine
[15:03.480 --> 15:08.040]  to them it's so fantastical that someone's linking to Japanese and South
[15:08.040 --> 15:13.080]  African and Russian and Mexican news and alternative media or some lady who shot
[15:13.080 --> 15:19.040]  a cell phone video without commentary just here it is what do you think here's
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.120]  10 articles about you know cameras going up a street corners that face scan you
[15:23.120 --> 15:26.960]  oh you crazy conspiracy theorist all these doings linking to mainstream media
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.960]  but he's showing connecting the dots how it's rolling out or all these Pentagon
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.080]  people admitting robots will replace all combat troops within 10 years and then
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.560]  he links to top scientists in mainstream news saying we're gonna be taken over by
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.240]  computers they go look at drudge fear mongering and about robot takeovers all
[15:43.240 --> 15:49.360]  you get was linked to a spectrum of it to show you it's a trend but it's the end
[15:49.360 --> 15:52.480]  of the establishment if you start thinking for yourself and I'm not getting
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.400]  all the news but it's important to look at this because they attack drudge they
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.960]  attack Trump me show people the article of your TV viewer info wars.com forward
[16:00.960 --> 16:08.360]  slash show to find the free video feeds and it says make America great again and
[16:08.360 --> 16:14.880]  they stick a drudge hat on Donald Trump and of course Trump's committing a war
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.800]  crime according to the globalist in the info war by admitting the plan is to not
[16:18.800 --> 16:23.000]  make America great the plan is to slowly suck us dry while our blood sweat
[16:23.000 --> 16:28.920]  and tears builds the big tax exempt global government and the article goes
[16:28.920 --> 16:35.640]  on why is Matt drudge boosting Donald Trump Donald Trump hit the zeitgeist six
[16:35.640 --> 16:40.000]  eight months ago Donald Trump is saying what the American people are feeling and
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.080]  witnessing and drudge is feeling the same thing so he's just dialing into it
[16:45.080 --> 16:50.320]  but they act like oh it's all drudge's fault oh it's such a terrible thing see
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.640]  if he could just be dealt with let me tell you where this is going this is
[16:53.640 --> 16:59.480]  going in campaign finance reform as multiple members of the FCC board have
[16:59.480 --> 17:05.620]  said on both sides that they are going to try next year to pass laws and get
[17:05.620 --> 17:11.160]  the Supreme Court to rule that Matt drudge cannot even exist because he's
[17:11.160 --> 17:15.560]  political well everybody is political everybody has their free speech he
[17:15.560 --> 17:23.920]  should be able to link to a clip of Obama saying that there's 57 states but
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.640]  see that's where all of this is going and he had a Supreme Court justice tell
[17:27.640 --> 17:34.840]  him with next year we've been told that basically they have the votes they're
[17:34.840 --> 17:39.400]  going to rule to shut you down and by the way that means talk radio and that
[17:39.400 --> 17:44.040]  means this show so drudge comes here comes out of the shadows after all the
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.000]  behind-the-scenes harassment he's gone through and also even at that comes on
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.680]  this show in the shadows right over there 20 feet away behind the cameras and
[17:53.680 --> 18:03.160]  lays all this out and they make fun of it it goes on the public evidence we have
[18:03.160 --> 18:07.840]  is the big and very rare interview drudge gave back in October to wing nut oh
[18:07.840 --> 18:12.080]  look they use a term like wing nut how original radio host Alex Jones where he
[18:12.080 --> 18:15.720]  delivered gems like this one you've got to be the greatest you can be now
[18:15.720 --> 18:19.880]  before this country is so completely altered and we're left with Hillary's
[18:19.880 --> 18:24.560]  brain in the Oval Office in a jar because that's where we're getting she
[18:24.560 --> 18:30.160]  is old she is sick she is not a contender they're making her a contender with
[18:30.160 --> 18:34.840]  these propped up Saturday Night Live things it's like a head on a stick and
[18:34.840 --> 18:41.840]  the today show I had on a stick she is not viable vibrant leader for this
[18:41.840 --> 18:45.880]  country of 300 and including the illegal 380 million Americans so the media is
[18:45.880 --> 18:50.920]  trying to put us to sleep and then he goes on to warn about they're coming for
[18:50.920 --> 18:54.480]  our free speech we've got a rally we've got to take action this is the biggest
[18:54.480 --> 19:01.160]  guy when it comes to actual power in the US media arguably the world media I
[19:01.160 --> 19:04.960]  mean who's more influential to put a big story out and get it covered Vladimir
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.560]  Putin Matt drudge then what a rush limbaugh and Alex Jones after that and
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.440]  thank God I'm not one of the very top people it's scary enough up at these
[19:15.440 --> 19:19.200]  sites believe me like floating around at 10,000 feet in a hot air balloon and you
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.640]  got gremlins crawling around the top poking it with needles literally scurrying

[19:28.560 --> 19:32.320]  balloon trying to swat them off I mean it's just the public's like zombies
[19:32.320 --> 19:35.760]  wandering around having no idea this huge wars going on oh I'm a wingnut is

[24:26.840 --> 24:31.520]  burrow into the news at the start of the next segment but this one is short six
[24:31.520 --> 24:39.600]  minutes long I want to talk about the real cosmology of the world which is in
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.320]  the history books which is in common sense which is in all the basic
[24:43.320 --> 24:47.800]  literature both fiction and nonfiction we know how humans operate we know the
[24:47.800 --> 24:55.680]  basic rules we know what our species is done generation after generation and you
[24:55.680 --> 25:03.680]  watch mainstream media it is at war with common sense and why is that because
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.760]  our forebears weren't perfect but they live closer to the ground closer to the
[25:07.760 --> 25:15.680]  weather closer to the bandits on the road they weren't inserted into this high
[25:15.680 --> 25:22.640]  tech media bubble and they would never put up with the basic things that are
[25:22.640 --> 25:28.240]  going on all around us today and that's why they've tried to arrest the
[25:28.240 --> 25:31.840]  development of so many Westerners it's why they try to make people cynical and
[25:31.840 --> 25:37.280]  stupid and uninformed and then the political managing class like trained
[25:37.280 --> 25:43.440]  seals just say wingnut crazy tinfoil hat did that work five years ago when we
[25:43.440 --> 25:47.360]  exposed you were using al Qaeda in in Libya did it work three years ago in
[25:47.360 --> 25:54.000]  Syria did it work in Egypt no I mean we report real things we have real high
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.160]  level military intelligence operatives whistleblowers on and others do this as
[25:59.160 --> 26:07.480]  well thank God and we absolutely devastate your operations and then you
[26:07.480 --> 26:14.000]  respond by calling us wingnuts again okay oh my gosh I'm in third grade you
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.080]  just called me a boogerface what am I gonna do I'm a 42 year old man
[26:22.080 --> 26:28.640]  committed to defending this Republic and you are calling me names and I
[26:28.640 --> 26:31.960]  illustrate that for everybody just to look at how pathetic our enemies are
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.360]  thank God they're so pathetic but they do have our tax money and they are on top
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.800]  of us they weigh about 400 pounds but they don't have any muscles we can just
[26:41.800 --> 26:44.600]  roll them off of us and they're not gonna be able to get back up maybe like a
[26:44.600 --> 26:55.840]  beetle in the sun but you got to decide you want to get them off of you now it
[26:55.840 --> 27:03.080]  is so unprecedented what's happening at this point and Obama's nonchalant stuff
[27:03.080 --> 27:06.320]  going out there to Hawaii and all the rest of it acting like he doesn't care
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.080]  and acting like everything's fine that's Obama hiding out he is working 12 14
[27:11.080 --> 27:14.920]  hours a day while he's out there to destroy this country he's making the
[27:14.920 --> 27:20.840]  phone calls to get the guns they're coming after everything this next year

[34:03.360 --> 34:10.040]  have to take that destiny in our hands and in our hearts and we have to carry
[34:10.040 --> 34:20.280]  out the important work of defying the control freaks and the tyrants I'm Alex
[34:20.280 --> 34:25.560]  Jones your host dedicated to defending human liberty and I want to thank you
[34:25.560 --> 34:29.800]  all for joining us and trying in this college of ideas to work towards
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.040]  solutions and ideas that can challenge the fairy tale the globalist are trying
[34:34.040 --> 34:39.080]  to sell us that humans are ugly and bad and are a failed species at the end of
[34:39.080 --> 34:44.200]  humanity is soon upon us we should crawl into a hole and just die giving the
[34:44.200 --> 34:52.160]  world to the globalist to become gods there are no gods at all coming up
[34:52.160 --> 35:00.040]  senator Paul appalled by NSA spying on Congress notice and I'm not saying Paul's
[35:00.040 --> 35:05.400]  doing this because he's a smart guy but you notice they expose the NSA spying
[35:05.400 --> 35:10.640]  that is constitutional and they don't expose all the other programs where
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.720]  everything that Congress does is tracked by more than 16 agencies the NSA is
[35:16.720 --> 35:24.840]  spying on foreign communiques voice memos text messages phone calls from
[35:24.840 --> 35:34.000]  foreign countries and Israel doesn't like that and so Israel has operatives in
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.680]  the media putting I'm not an enemy of Israel but it's my job to tell you what's
[35:37.680 --> 35:46.600]  going on and I don't want any foreign government spying on Congress because
[35:46.600 --> 35:52.440]  they can then blackmail them and Israel does that big time and Israel has
[35:52.440 --> 35:59.920]  different political parties over there and if I have one big beef with the
[35:59.920 --> 36:06.640]  general is Israel lobby it's not even the three billion in foreign 80 year
[36:06.640 --> 36:13.640]  that's chicken feed my issue is Israel basically every political party over
[36:13.640 --> 36:17.680]  there lobbies and gives money to gun control groups in our country to take
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.720]  our guns when Israel lets any citizen that wants it have a gun to protect
[36:22.720 --> 36:29.760]  themselves and I'm tired of foreign governments lobbying England the UK
[36:29.760 --> 36:33.720]  lobbies and gives money to get our guns I'm tired of all these foreign
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.760]  countries in our business you know who it in our business the Russians you know
[36:38.760 --> 36:46.160]  who the media tells us in our business the Russians more loads of bull but
[36:46.160 --> 36:49.680]  there's the rest of story and it's just so irritating to see it the news the
[36:49.680 --> 36:54.240]  only reason you're hearing about it is because there are patriots in the NSA
[36:54.240 --> 37:02.800]  who are pointing out that foreign governments are spying on Congress
[37:03.360 --> 37:10.080]  US spy net on Israel snares Congress talk about spin Wall Street Journal
[37:10.080 --> 37:17.920]  that's coming up we'll talk about that with Cy Hirsch but first off Israeli
[37:17.920 --> 37:26.040]  commander claims that US secretly evacuated ISIS leaders to safety now
[37:26.720 --> 37:33.800]  what they use is merc groups sheep depth seals green berets others in the
[37:33.800 --> 37:37.640]  State Department to carry this out we know about this because it's not a
[37:37.640 --> 37:41.240]  claim it's a Steve Watson article in four words calm because this is a
[37:41.240 --> 37:47.240]  long-standing operation and the reason we know about it is because people like
[37:47.240 --> 37:54.320]  Anthony Schaefer back in 2002 went public to the San Francisco Chronicle as
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.920]  well as in other special forces full colonel he was a lieutenant colonel at
[37:58.920 --> 38:08.520]  the time pointing out that thousands of al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders were
[38:08.520 --> 38:15.960]  flown out to safety before the invasions even really began and they only bombed
[38:15.960 --> 38:24.720]  conscripts in the front lines it was a totally staged war totally staged now
[38:24.720 --> 38:29.480]  the conscripts didn't know that they weren't fighting for Allah but I'm not
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.600]  just going to make that claim here's the article info wars calm we're going to go
[38:34.600 --> 38:37.640]  over it in a moment but let me just give you background see this is how my
[38:37.640 --> 38:43.160]  brain works the instant I saw this this morning on info wars calm so we'll
[38:43.160 --> 38:47.520]  actually pull this up is when it printed it it actually erased it the
[38:47.520 --> 38:53.160]  headline the airlift of evil NBC news see that we'll actually pull it up online
[38:53.160 --> 39:01.840]  because again the printer put a box over it airlift of evil NBC news there it
[39:01.840 --> 39:06.760]  is the United States took the unprecedented step though this week of
[39:06.760 --> 39:09.800]  demanding that foreign airlines provide information on passenger boarding
[39:09.800 --> 39:14.360]  planes to America yet in the past week a half dozen or more Pakistani Air Force
[39:14.360 --> 39:18.360]  cargo planes landed in the Taliban held city of Kunduz and evacuated to
[39:18.360 --> 39:22.240]  Pakistan hundreds to turn out it was thousands of non-afghan soldiers who
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.680]  fought alongside the Taliban and even al-Qaeda against the United States what's
[39:26.680 --> 39:31.000]  wrong with this picture she no evil in denial that that's all the spin it came
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.600]  out later it was thousands and they basically evacuated the Akhani network
[39:36.600 --> 39:41.600]  out of the country here's another one do you realize the U.S. funded and trained
[39:41.600 --> 39:48.520]  ISIS there's another report U.S. air drops weapons to ISIS as Iraq Army makes
[39:48.520 --> 39:55.080]  gains confirmed Benghazi was covered up for arms transfer to al-Qaeda ex-DIA
[39:55.080 --> 39:58.440]  chief Obama willfully allowed rise of ISIS that that headlines I think was
[39:58.440 --> 40:05.360]  strong enough from world that daily I'm not bad the general Flynn said that they
[40:05.360 --> 40:10.800]  were ordered to do it consciously newly to class one U.S. government documents
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.560]  the West supported the creation of ISIS former DIA director U.S. main willful
[40:15.560 --> 40:23.000]  decision support ISIS so here's this current story about Iraq commander
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.240]  claims the U.S. secretly evacuated ISIS leaders to safety but when you say the
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.800]  U.S. you mean the criminal State Department elements that are part of the
[40:31.800 --> 40:35.560]  long-standing coup of this country since 1913 of the financial system now
[40:35.560 --> 40:38.920]  there's just mopping up the states mopping up the families mopping up what
[40:38.920 --> 40:41.520]  was left the Bill of Rights and Constitution I mean America our
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.520]  Republic was a big elephant to eat
[40:45.520 --> 41:03.200]  you know what I keep thinking about what keeps jumping into my mind while I'm
[41:03.200 --> 41:07.200]  covering all this other news the fact that the day after I said Trump you
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.640]  need to go after Hillary for lying and saying she was on the ground and being
[41:12.640 --> 41:19.120]  shot at and attacked in Serbia and it was all lies and then I know for a fact
[41:19.120 --> 41:21.960]  that was relayed directly to Trump and he did it the next day wasn't on meat
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.880]  the press or something and I'm not on a power trip I'm just sitting here
[41:25.880 --> 41:34.320]  realizing what will happen if Trump goes after this now no Trump's really smart
[41:34.320 --> 41:40.560]  it's just surreal and we can write an article drugs links to it Trump
[41:40.560 --> 41:52.560]  retweets it I want to get like all these top experts on every week and like
[41:52.560 --> 41:57.280]  have a roundtable discussion wargaming what we should do as the patriots with
[41:57.280 --> 42:01.360]  the truth with the narrative to fight the globalist we're just generally
[42:01.360 --> 42:04.800]  educated the public about what's going on we have an incredible track record our
[42:04.800 --> 42:14.400]  guests our experts do and our responsibility is frighteningly huge and
[42:14.400 --> 42:16.960]  the reason I talk about this more and more and I gave a speech to my reporters
[42:16.960 --> 42:22.560]  today the TV reporters that hey take yourselves really seriously I know you
[42:22.560 --> 42:27.920]  do that you're you're you're in a legendary position
[42:27.920 --> 42:34.720]  I just can't believe it but it's a testament to what taking action can do
[42:34.720 --> 42:37.520]  and that's why I want everybody out there listening and watching to know no
[42:37.520 --> 42:40.840]  matter how bad all this gets in the future we're going to make it out of it
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.240]  because so many seeds have been planted of truth that tyranny will be like
[42:45.240 --> 42:48.360]  sunshine and water to make a lot of seeds that haven't sprouted will sprout
[42:48.360 --> 42:59.480]  seeds that were planted 30 40 years ago by people like Leon Scalzen seeds that
[42:59.480 --> 43:10.440]  were planted by Alan Greenspan 50 years ago 45 years ago Alan Greenspan was
[43:10.440 --> 43:17.160]  basically like the Alex Jones of the 60s he wrote books and had essays
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.600]  published against global government against you know the private
[43:21.600 --> 43:26.520]  Federal Reserve and a monetary plan to help America they went and bought him
[43:26.520 --> 43:32.880]  off see when you really know history it's so amazing I mean he was like Anakin
[43:32.880 --> 43:36.400]  Skywalker becoming Darth Vader
[43:37.320 --> 43:40.760]  you know I'll tell you who knows Greenspan and knows all these people you
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.280]  know had dinner with Ronald Reagan you know years before you know was friends
[43:44.280 --> 43:47.240]  with Ronald Reagan before Ronald Reagan got in the office when Ronald Reagan was governor
[43:47.240 --> 43:50.960]  he's coming on next hour Dr. Paul Greg Roberts
[43:52.280 --> 43:55.800]  you know we get these guys on and people don't even in the general public
[43:55.800 --> 43:58.840]  realize who they're listening to it's like Psy Hirsch is coming on he exposed
[43:58.840 --> 44:04.440]  the me line massacre in Vietnam I mean this is a legend and I'm not bragging
[44:04.440 --> 44:07.800]  about the guess we get it's that we're willing to have them on and let them
[44:07.800 --> 44:18.120]  actually say what they want and the Daily Beast response is to make fun of
[44:18.120 --> 44:23.120]  everybody and call me a wing nut and call drudge names I mean that's what
[44:23.120 --> 44:31.040]  five-year-olds do they don't intellectually I think I was about 12
[44:31.040 --> 44:39.360]  years old when they had a junior high prom and I brought the beauty queen to
[44:39.360 --> 44:46.360]  the prom so everybody else was scared to ask her out I was so mindless and
[44:46.360 --> 44:50.040]  instinctive when I was young which is a sign of intelligence earlier on that I
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.600]  was so tuned into my instincts that I always got to date the best girls cuz
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.560]  nobody else would ask him out and I'm not bragging about that was just funny
[44:59.560 --> 45:03.560]  story I kind of click oh people were starting fights with me at the prom and
[45:03.560 --> 45:06.600]  people were saying my tuxedo look stupid and people are saying I'm a bad
[45:06.600 --> 45:11.200]  dancer a lot of folks were cool I remember it finally clicked oh that's why
[45:11.200 --> 45:16.200]  they're being mean because I've got the best-looking girl and I'm the best
[45:16.200 --> 45:24.240]  looking see and that's all this is and I mean that in arrogant way these are
[45:24.240 --> 45:29.720]  discredited imploding facades that a high wind comes down every week on
[45:29.720 --> 45:35.000]  mainstream media system collapses and then you know scarlo slim one of the
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.200]  biggest mafia dons in the world from Mexico the one of the richest men in
[45:40.200 --> 45:48.160]  the world comes in and buys the New York Times like his toy it's failed seeing
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.040]  in is failed I was in there three years ago I've been there many times before

[45:59.160 --> 46:03.480]  King was there I'd been in studios on another show it was all nice glistening
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.000]  clean energy people everywhere I was in there it was a ghost town with trade
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.240]  carpet and dirty toilets with feces splattered on the walls of every major
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.880]  bathroom like a Jackson Pollock and I walked out of there and I said CNN's
[46:16.880 --> 46:26.560]  dead it's walking dead that's who these people are they're frauds and they need
[46:26.560 --> 46:34.600]  to know they're frauds we know why you don't like us we know why you lie about

[54:15.120 --> 54:22.880]  of our species to a great extent is being decided right now welcome to a

[54:30.240 --> 54:35.680]  no turning back and you can't be in denial about that the minute you're
[54:35.680 --> 54:39.280]  aware of the globalist program and how it operates though it becomes a game to
[54:39.280 --> 54:47.040]  fight it you see you're designed to adapt and overcome the problem is we tend
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.080]  to adapt to incremental tyranny by actually submitting to it and learning
[54:51.080 --> 54:57.400]  to live with it and that would work if it was environmental and we didn't have
[54:57.400 --> 55:00.320]  a way to change our environment but humans are all about changing our
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.560]  environments overcoming our environment but the new environments we built have
[55:06.560 --> 55:10.760]  helped us in many ways but have now been hijacked to be prisons this is
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.880]  fundamental what I'm saying I was thinking about watching my daughters
[55:15.880 --> 55:25.400]  drive off to camp art camp this morning how it is the number one most dangerous
[55:25.400 --> 55:33.360]  thing in their life as I watched the SUV drive away and I thought about them
[55:33.360 --> 55:36.680]  becoming 16 and cars and had a lot of anxiety about it because that's a real
[55:36.680 --> 55:42.520]  danger and I realized how we've just adapted to cars killing millions of
[55:42.520 --> 55:48.480]  people every year and how that's an example of how we just accept that our
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.200]  kids may go down to get gather water at the waterhole and a saber-toothed
[55:53.200 --> 55:57.440]  tiger might jump out and eat them we hope it doesn't happen we can't always go to
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.680]  the waterhole with them I got to go out and hunt and I got to let my daughters
[56:01.680 --> 56:10.640]  go down to the waterhole and maybe get eaten and I just handle that I can
[56:10.640 --> 56:18.280]  compartmentalize that as a man because it's part of the environment now sure I
[56:18.280 --> 56:20.600]  try to make sure when they go to the waterhole that they always go with
[56:20.600 --> 56:27.800]  somebody an adult a younger male younger male tells them don't wander off too
[56:27.800 --> 56:37.280]  far they don't always listen until they see someone get eaten by a big cat let's
[56:37.280 --> 56:42.960]  go back to our race memories here human race the one race the one that triumph
[56:42.960 --> 56:46.800]  the one that went through all this together now the system has this at
[56:46.800 --> 56:54.480]  odds with each other a predatory group above us playing God so we have to not
[56:54.480 --> 56:58.600]  adapt to their tyranny by putting up with it we have to adapt by exposing it
[56:58.600 --> 57:04.960]  and empowering ourselves to engage in financial and informational and spiritual
[57:04.960 --> 57:11.400]  and cultural war and like lifting weights or climbing a mountain we will
[57:11.400 --> 57:21.800]  become stronger in the animating contest the enlightenment the empowerment is not
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.680]  adapting to their nanny state that dehumanizes us but facing the dangers
[57:25.680 --> 57:29.240]  because they're going to come in and say self-driving cars will keep the wrecks
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.000]  down don't you not want your daughters to die but in truth it's not just some
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.400]  faceless computer that isn't trying to enslave us it's being programmed as the
[57:37.400 --> 57:43.680]  artificial system to deliver my daughters into an even more dangerous world and so
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.280]  because of that I oppose it even if we had a good government building a
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.400]  panoptagon computer system to quote keep us all safe what would happen when
[57:54.400 --> 57:58.560]  those controllers died or a new generation got control or an AI system
[57:58.560 --> 58:02.360]  that was evil or an alien intelligence from a deep space nebula
[58:02.360 --> 58:07.760]  Kane and uses this system to hijack things you don't want centralized one
[58:07.760 --> 58:12.000]  point of failure systems and that's what the globalists are setting up I can
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.680]  write a science fiction book as an allegory where aliens come deceive them
[58:15.680 --> 58:18.680]  they're giving them all this power deceive an elite they're giving them
[58:18.680 --> 58:22.840]  control and really they're just building a system to enslave everyone but
[58:22.840 --> 58:26.760]  that's historically what will happen they're building something that will
[58:26.760 --> 58:32.720]  destroy the elite themselves we have to have a real debate about this with the
[58:32.720 --> 58:36.560]  people and we're here to force that debate about what's currently being
[58:36.560 --> 58:49.280]  decided the future destiny of the species stay with us spread the word over the

[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:50.800]  remember colonel Craig Roberts who just wants to fade off into the distance
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:59.080]  basically his family was high-level CIA and then he chose to just go be in the
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.280]  Marines in Vietnam wrote one shot one kill was a famous sniper and then he came
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.200]  back and was just police officer SWAT team commander helicopter pilot it had a
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.480]  just amazing life and then he had a near-death experience we died for ten
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.640]  minutes completely dead they've walked off and left and I spent some time with
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.040]  him in Oklahoma where he lives and events around the country he's just a
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.680]  really classy guy but there's this thing that happens with these older guys
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:36.640]  they just fade out they just don't want to fight anymore they just want to be
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:42.960]  left alone we need to get him back on the show he's really interesting guy
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.600]  one time the helicopter engine went out and he did that auto rotate deal from
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.280]  like thousands of feet up he said he got out of the helicopter and him and the
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.760]  co-pilot were like two inches shorter because it compacted his whole spine I
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.240]  don't know I just kind of wander around I mean it's not that I don't have enough
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:05.920]  news to cover it's just it's so hardcore what's going on Niko I want
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.760]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on but I want Colonel Craig Roberts on number one
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:19.560]  time I told the producer it's like a decade ago I said get me Craig Roberts

[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.320]  all these articles have one thing in common you are being trained and
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.480]  conditioned to accept less we are living in a society that's going through
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.760]  monumental technological changes we have the ability to create systems where
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.920]  everyone can prosper but what's going on the social engineers and social
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:52.040]  controllers of the world want us to expect less while paying more it's all
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:55.680]  about social control and this is the main reason why they want it rob do
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:03.040]  reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news and it's that type
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.040]  of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true

[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.200]  the state department's been running a covert war using mercenaries and others
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.520]  and that they've had major what I would call not mutiny but people fighting the
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:29.920]  takeover what steve pachanik yesterday called a soft coup and now you have the
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.080]  general the former head of defense intelligence going public a couple
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.080]  months ago coming out saying we were ordered to fund isis and al-qaeda
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.320]  deliberately by the neocons and obama basically this is unprecedented I want
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.680]  to get into this with dr. paul craig roberts I want to get into this on a big
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.240]  article that he wrote in a syndicated column that we covered at info wars
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.080]  dot com last week to talk about the state of what's happening but but I can
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.160]  tell you obviously talking to folks in the trump camp I'm gonna leave it at
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:05.040]  that and others donald trump is genuine and actually knows that there is a plan
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.240]  to take over the country and set up tyranny and trump wants to counter it
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.600]  and you see the relationship with trump and putin you see trump saying he wants
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.440]  to tax these big mega banks that are tax exempt he's really going after the
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.120]  establishment now somebody I really respect is dr. paul craig roberts father
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.120]  reaganomics good friends with ronald reagan a lot of the top think tanks
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:31.640]  conservative think tanks former editor chief editor wall street journal I wanted
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.520]  to get him on because if he's been a big insider and he's been somewhat
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.680]  pessimistic and understand why but I tell you there are some very exciting
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:47.040]  things happening right now in government in the military you name it that shows
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.640]  me that there are people making very moral stands now that we have an
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.320]  operation valkyrie no because there's not one hitler to take out I don't want
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:58.000]  any violence and in obama's a puppet but there is a soft coup against a bunch
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  of different agendas where we now learn our military was working with the
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.400]  russians and the syrians years ago to counter the insurgents the bad insurgents
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.400]  which are 90 plus percent so that's a briefing at the start of the hour for new
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.080]  listeners that just tuned in and I want to get into that the russia situation and
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.560]  what dr. roberts thinks about trump donald trump an evaluation and he goes
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.920]  over it and I think it's a thought-provoking evaluation so we're war
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:32.640]  gaming this here on air dr. roberts thank you for coming on with us so where do
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.800]  you want to start with trump or with the russians or with the situation with
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.840]  syrsh oh whatever suits you trump perhaps I'm let's let's go there because it
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:49.640]  all ties together your take on Donald trump well it's clear that he has the
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.240]  personality of a leader and I think he's liked because he doesn't back down he's
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:02.000]  not always apologizing he says something people get upset about but I think he has
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:10.720]  a lot of problems and that he doesn't really I think know what to do and he
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.080]  he seems to think that as long as he's making aggressive statements the people
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.160]  were following and that's probably the case because they're tired of all these
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:29.680]  people who are always a mealymouth and trumps not mealymouth but he's not he
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:36.800]  doesn't come out of the policy community he doesn't know the policy people who
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:45.480]  could help him change the policies and it's unlikely he would be staffed up
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.400]  with a government that could help him that's the difficult thing to do I mean
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:58.160]  it was hard even for Ronald Reagan to get some of us in there and Reagan was a
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:05.480]  longtime political figure he had something of a movement so my point is
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:12.560]  that without a movement behind him without policy knowledge he's not really
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:19.560]  well informed he may not be able to do much even if he gets an office would you
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:25.760]  be willing to talk to him and with some others and advise him on a policy group
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.640]  for his campaign to come in and help him because I agree he's very smart but has
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.480]  his perspective and so he does really good in some areas not so good in others
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:38.760]  I mean I mean obviously if he picked people from this political spectrum then
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:44.680]  that would probably obviously not scare the establishment as much either of
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.680]  course I'd be willing to talk to him but they would just tell him I'm a
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:59.480]  conspiracy theorist he won't listen to that but another problem he faces these
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.360]  the appointees have to be cleared by the Senate they have to be confirmed in office
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:11.400]  and all the interest groups have their claws into the senators and so if he
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.640]  if he tried to put in people who were in any sense controversial in the sense of
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:23.480]  disagreeing with the neoconservatives or disagreeing that the invasion of Iraq
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:31.240]  was a good thing or the overthrow of Qaddafi was a good thing the senators
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:37.040]  would simply not confirm them so it's very difficult given the way the
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:44.000]  American system works to get change out of it without a lot more awareness than
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.880]  exists both among people and among politicians and without politicians
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:56.080]  seeing that there's now more at stake than their campaign contributions and
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:03.200]  that they actually now have to take risks to save the country it takes that
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:09.560]  type of environment for a leader to be successful and without that environment
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.880]  it's difficult but don't we have the climate of forming the atmosphere now
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:22.720]  for that to happen I don't think so but I'm willing for there to be I mean I don't
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:29.800]  want to I'm not opposed to having that in college in fact that's why I do what I
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.800]  do I'm trying to make people aware so that we would have a climate or leader
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.840]  and obviously there's not a climate in the general public but there is a
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.880]  climate in the insiders and in the actual police and military believe me I
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.200]  have the contacts it's explosive and you have a lot of contacts sir but I know
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.840]  you're mainly with the big policy wonk level and the big think tanks and they
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.880]  may still you know not know what's going on I think they do they're pretty smart
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.800]  like you I'm here to tell you the people that actually do the hanging in this
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:06.120]  country are really awake right now well that's good news I was impressed when I
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.840]  saw the former head of the defense intelligence agency tell the truth about
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:19.640]  ISIS and our involvement and I've seen nice I've seen sensible patriotic
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:26.440]  things said by other military leaders that which is revolutionary and I even
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:32.520]  think Kissinger statements that we can't solve any problem unless we're in it
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:39.240]  together with the Russians you can't sometimes it's all problems and create
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.960]  conflict with Russia so exactly Kissinger is now writing huge articles of
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.840]  papers basically sounding like you hedging his bets when we all know he's
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.600]  been involved in all this so this is a big deal sir I mean I mean I understand
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.160]  that you know you like to be pessimistic so you don't overshoot how good we're
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.600]  doing but I'm telling you there's some real light here coming in well we're
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.840]  going to need these people if they'll have to take more and more risk and show
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.760]  more and more themselves just in order to the block the growing likelihood of
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:20.320]  conflict with Russia or with Russia and China this is still the neoconservative
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.040]  policy sure well the neocons can kick around Iraq or kick around a few
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.880]  countries they've been you know had sanctions on for 20 years but yeah
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:31.080]  they're not going to be able to take on Russia or China and I look at Richard
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.920]  Pearl and all Wolfowitz and all these guys they are literally the school wimp
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.000]  who's become a bully I mean that's what's scary to me is these are not
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.880]  military people well no they're not but they've been in the Pentagon they've
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:54.480]  been in the policy positions that control military policy so I wouldn't say
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.280]  they're powerless or without influence in fact that we still live in a neocon
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.720]  world and in the media they still have the media don't they I mean they've got
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.440]  the Wall Street Journal the weekly standard Fox News I mean got the whole
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:12.400]  thing the York Times the Washington purpose so in so much Washington
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:18.400]  responds to the print TV media not to you and I agree with you but we've come
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:24.440]  from behind we're gaining ground in this 12-round fight what do you make of
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:34.440]  the calls that we're seeing to have a national tax to quote pay to fight ISIS
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.000]  and then the State Department claims they've helped stabilize Syria I mean
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.600]  that's like Jeffrey Dahmer claiming he's against cannibalism this is so rich
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:51.320]  well it's like you say it's very rich it's not clear to what extent we're
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:59.680]  actually fighting ISIS it's our creation and we hope to use it to honestly we I
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:04.880]  mean what I mean the neocons and March hope to use ISIS to throw aside just
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:11.400]  like they used it to throw Gaddafi you know when the Russians and the British
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.520]  Parliament blocked a violence plan invasion Syria that's when the neocons
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:23.400]  turned to ISIS sent them in there to do the job pretending they were certain
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:31.840]  rebels fighting against the dictator so it's not clear you probably better
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.720]  inform us and I am how much Washington is really fighting ISIS you know when
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.200]  the Russians went in there we were very protective of ISIS didn't want the Russians
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:46.760]  attacking us well that's the policy people I can tell you directly from
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.520]  high-level Pentagon and many people that have been on the show that this is
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:58.920]  what's happened and Sy Hersh is coming on to break it down but every time they
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.880]  have the military whether it was Libya or whether it was Egypt or whether it was
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:10.440]  the situation in Syria right down to the non-commissioned officers right up to
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.440]  pretty much the top is why Obama had that big purge the last few years and put a
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:19.520]  bunch of just death jockeys in they got fed up with Benghazi watching for six
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.040]  seven hours on the predator footage of everybody being killed and the order to
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.160]  stand down from Hillary and then seeing her lie thousands actually witnessed
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.920]  that basically it turned into such a fiasco that caused a huge sea change to
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.360]  actually watch it for themselves despite all the corruption made them click and
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.560]  then all these whistleblowers started exposing the plan to turn loose these
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.440]  al-Qaeda proxy armies all over in a deal with Saudi Arabia to destabilize
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.560]  things and so the military began blowing the whistle and so even general
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:54.960]  started quietly through Egypt and others feeding the Russians and Assad intel and
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:58.560]  then you've got the State Department over there trying to cover everything up
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.640]  with the Pentagon leaking or large factions of it leaking that Hillary was
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:08.760]  in an arms deal and that's basically what's going on I mean Colonel Shaffer
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.920]  told me a couple years ago that you know he was in hearings with Congress and he
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.360]  said I'm not gonna tell you what I told them but now I'm gonna say this here so
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  he could obviously not get arrested and then said to me what was going on and
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.120]  what he's been allowed to say is directed from folks in the Pentagon
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.560]  obviously and I've been talked to other high-level people higher up than
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.960]  colonels and they definitely are for real they also see it as it's such a
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.640]  gamble by the establishment to back al-Qaeda if this blows back in America
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.320]  they think they can't spin it in the media that the government didn't bring
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:49.400]  them in so they're ready to basically try to separate that our military was
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.560]  involved and blaming on the State Department even though they were involved
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.080]  from the start but not willingly so it's a very sophisticated moment we've
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:03.280]  reached sir well I'm not entirely surprised at that I do know that the
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:11.120]  military officers have had or a number of number of military officers doing this
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.120]  whole new conservative era they've had a very poor opinion of the name of the
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:23.560]  service and their various schemes and but of course their promotions and
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.360]  appointments were controlled by neoconservatives and so they really
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.440]  couldn't do much about it but I'm glad to see they've had that an increasing
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.360]  number of them have had enough and are prepared to put their foot down and to
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:43.360]  and to speak the mornings that people need to hear so that's I agree that's
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.560]  encouraging news it's also encouraging that the new kinds have not been able to
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.920]  completely corrupt the officer corps I'm sure they've tried by by promotions and
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:01.400]  other other such methods and the fact that we still have what you're telling
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.440]  me I conclude we still have an officer corps with some integrity and some
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:14.080]  ability to think about the country and to see themselves not as the end all be
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:20.720]  all but to see the country and so that's the that's a good development that
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:26.760]  means that we are in a stronger position than we are than we were and it means the
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:32.360]  neocons are in a weaker one but they're still there and they could pull any type
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.320]  of trick with your knowledge of the neoconserv being around them for 30
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:40.720]  years are longer in Washington what type of bag of tricks do you think they've
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:48.320]  got okay I think that they're well connected to whatever the black ops
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:55.880]  forces are that are not really controlled or well-known they're all
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:01.320]  affected they're off the books and I think the new kinds are well connected
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:07.440]  to this like our groups and they can act independently of the official government
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:15.680]  they can pull off black flag flag events a false flag event and so what would
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.720]  they do you know if the neocons feel they're losing power losing their
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:30.080]  grip control they may get increasingly reckless so I can't really say on the
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.000]  other hand it's possible that some of the neoconserv is themselves are losing
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.880]  their confidence in their agenda of world hegemony I think many of them did
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:50.920]  think that the situation in Iraq would be over with very quickly we would be
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:56.440]  here seen as a great liberator and people would be friendly and we would
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:02.360]  have another vassal state I think many of them did believe that and so there's a
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:09.840]  lot in the events to disillusion those among the neoconserv is who have the
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.000]  ability of any of any introspection well yeah they claim they want to fight
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.440]  Iran everything they do helps Iran and they come to want to break Iraq in three
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.200]  parts but then claim they don't let's shift gears into Putin as you know he
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.280]  came out in the last few weeks so did Lavrov the farm minister and said who's
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.000]  in control your Syria operations because your military is giving us info and and
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.800]  helping us but then your State Department and others are directing
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.160]  things that are helping him who is in control I mean pretty much Putin is
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.600]  signaling he knows there's an internal fight going on well he's he's right I
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:50.600]  suspect it may be that there are different people in control look I can
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:56.920]  remember Alex when I was in Treasury I would go over to White House meetings
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.840]  with the president of his economic policy and the president would make a
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.560]  decision and everybody left with a different understanding of what the
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.800]  decision was because they were all shaping the decision to support their
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.560]  own agenda sure it's like an interpreter when you're doing a TV show saying
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.520]  something you didn't say that's right and and and so there are so many
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:30.040]  agendas and some and there's so many alliances a lot of the alliances are
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.320]  unlikely but for the moment the two agendas fit and so they support one
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:40.040]  another you know these things are not predictable I think what we have to be
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.440]  worried about is the language of hostility that has developed in official
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.920]  Washington all the debates the debates the Russians said it's like human
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.680]  sacrifice of Russia ritual sacrifice bloody their nose blow up their
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.440]  airplanes I mean it's crazy yeah I know and so what I'm saying is we we have to
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.960]  worry about this language of violence and hostility that comes out of the
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:10.240]  media presidential candidates because this shows that there's no there's no
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.840]  trust between nuclear powers and if there's no trust between nuclear powers
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:22.480]  that's when you really get the likelihood of a nuclear war you know all
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:29.360]  doing my lifetime from John Kennedy through Reagan and George Herbert Walker
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:35.560]  Butch the office of president was always trying to build trust between
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.920]  Washington and Moscow they wanted trust between the two nuclear powers so that
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.560]  nobody would jump to their own conclusion push but well what we've
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.960]  seen in the Neoconservative era is a complete destruction of this trust
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:56.960]  and again we have massive distrust with Putin giving recent orders to have the
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:05.200]  entire triad of the Soviet nuclear force modernized and on full readiness
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:12.760]  these types of moves are we're back into a worse and we've given Russia the
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.320]  initiative to actually build up expand it actually is against American interest
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.480]  we've actually made put in a superstar all because the Neocons don't want
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.640]  anyone talking to the policy heads because they're so jealous and greedy
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.320]  like it's a college frat in a popularity contest oh don't talk to them
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.680]  they're bad people and then it endangers the whole world it sounds like
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:38.560]  horrible amateur foreign policy sir yeah but they're in charge and this is the
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.080]  danger that they've created so I'm saying as hopeful as we can see some of
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.480]  developments that you've talked about we have to keep in mind we still have this
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.400]  very dangerous situation when the Neoconservatives had broken down trust
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:57.880]  I agree and and and when you have that type of a situation it's dangerous I
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.800]  think we are more danger now than we were at any time during the Cold War because
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.520]  there's less trust I mean how can Putin trust Washington we broke every agreement
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:14.120]  they're mad dog they're mad dog demonizing we issued threats you know
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:20.560]  they can't trust us and so it won't take too much for them to say well as them

[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.960]  let's hear congressman coon one more time we play this yesterday but such a
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:32.480]  big deal it's so ridiculous it's so evil that I thought we'd play it one more
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:35.760]  time because I don't want to just talk about it in the last segment in the
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.000]  non-actually play it if you're a new listener or somebody that missed the
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.040]  show yesterday they are all over TV by the way promoting a new national tax on
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.640]  top of all the other taxes to quote fight ISIS when the criminals that run
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:55.680]  our government are on record creating the whole thing and our own Pentagon has
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.400]  had four generals come out and say they were ordered to and that it was wrong and
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.760]  the media has tried to spin it we just keep hammering this point because this
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.560]  is one of the stories one of the levers that could bring these people down let
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.280]  me show you the article that's on info wars dot com put it back on screen where
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.680]  the congressman has come out and done this senator Chris Coons Democrat from
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:25.360]  Delaware and this is what the establishment is pushing this is what is
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:31.280]  being put out let's go to the clip president Obama sent us an AUMF that's
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.640]  Washington speak for a request for a declaration of war against ISIS all the
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.080]  way back in February and we have not taken it up debated it and passed it and
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:45.920]  we owe that to our veterans and to those serving in the conflict against ISIS but
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.440]  we also need to stand up and say how are we going to pay for it all the previous
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:55.160]  wars as you referenced before Iraq and Afghanistan had a dedicated war surtax
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.840]  and I think that's one way we could fairly pay for it with a small surtax
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.520]  that exempted active duty military families and veterans but there's other
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.040]  ways we could pay for it we just can't keep going without even discussing it
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.120]  senator yeah the surtax idea makes sense logically but then you run into a
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.480]  small and this is just to play devil's advocate you run into a small problem
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.960]  which is it's really really difficult to actually budget for wars for instance
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.320]  the initial projections for the cost of the record I believe we're 50 to 60
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.200]  billion dollars and it being well over a trillion dollars so what happens when
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:33.000]  that surtax isn't enough what happens when you have to go back to the well
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.240]  well you literally can adjust the amount of the surtax annually in order to meet
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:43.120]  the needs of that specific conflict it frankly will make members of Congress
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.520]  hesitate there's a whole lot let's stop right there and again I asked this
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.240]  question back four years ago when Benghazi happened I said when they turn
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.440]  al-qaeda loose all over the world to overthrow Libya you name it Syria Egypt
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.320]  Iraq do they think we're so dumb then when they let them into the West and
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.160]  they attack us this is a real giant al-qaeda army al-qaeda before was like
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.880]  three to five thousand people riddled with Western intelligence a wind-up
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:12.360]  toy now they went out recruited giant real armies of psychos and scum and
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.960]  crazies and they let them fly back and forth they let them have training bases
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.480]  they let them get taxpayer money because when they come here and attack stuff
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.480]  folks they're going to take our guns they're going to take veterans guns
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.200]  they're going to come after our money they're going to put naked body scanners
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.320]  in they're going to militarize the country and point it at the patriots for
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.800]  the takeover and they keep saying our number one threat is not radical Islam
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.000]  these attacks of San Bernardino are not radical Islam it is the patriot the
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.120]  veteran the returning veteran the Christian the conservative the
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.880]  libertarian the patriot their articles every week claiming I'm calling for
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.680]  violence their articles constantly claiming I want people to attack the
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.800]  government that I want cops dead the exact opposite of what I've said for 20
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:09.080]  years and why do you think that is because they're priming the pump remember
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.600]  that Democrat memo that Fox News even covered three years ago where they said
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.640]  don't worry Obama's not going to be in political trouble for your election and
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.480]  in the future Democrats are going to take over don't worry because there's
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:25.000]  going to be terror attacks in America and the conservatives and libertarians
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:31.040]  are going to get in big trouble for them high-level billionaire millionaire
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.240]  Democrat donors how to find that newscast it's going back talked about it and it
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:42.280]  said in the memos blame people like Glenn Beck I'm not an enemy of Glenn
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:48.960]  Beck I want Glenn Beck to succeed and to be a good guy it's good to have other
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.240]  people talking about the New World Order and pro-second amendment and family I
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.760]  just don't like the fact that he's said so many things about me over the years
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.880]  that aren't true and misrepresented for months he say I'm gonna expose there's
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.560]  no FEMA camps or we'll see if there are real a lot of the big announcement he
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.600]  kept making jokes about it and I said I waited till the day it was gonna air the
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.360]  day before as I didn't want them to just tailor it is what I said I knew it and I
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.640]  said they're gonna go show hoax videos of railway stations and stuff in Illinois
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.320]  and other places that I've seen for you know a decade with tens of millions of
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.960]  views on YouTube that's even before YouTube I'd be sent the VHS why don't
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.280]  you cover this FEMA camp and I'd say we've been there it's a railway station
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.240]  it's not a FEMA camp and then it came on and said Alex Jones believes that this
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:43.040]  is a FEMA camp it's not see it's a straw man just like Donald Trump hates all
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.040]  Mexicans no Donald Trump said we've got a screen people coming in we can't offer
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.680]  everything free we're collapsing as a nation we can't do this that's what
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.080]  Donald Trump really said and the reason I talk about myself is to defend the
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.160]  idea what we cover is under attack the truth we tell is under attack and the
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:03.920]  way they attack truth is they don't attack the truth they build a straw man
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:17.160]  a fact simile and they go after that and that's what they're doing today I want
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.500]  to go to these articles now that we haven't detailed yet but it is a big
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:26.280]  deal Steve Watson wrote the story Iraqi commander claims that US secretly
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.640]  evacuated ISIS leaders to safety and then I show you NBC where they were
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:37.120]  ordered to do that on record in 2001 it's called the airlift of evil this is
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.760]  our government moving the fighters leadership around to then have real
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.040]  wars with our troops and others you're like well how's that work if you're a
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.080]  global government and you're playing countries off against each other and you
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.040]  own defense complexes in the UK France Germany Russia you know Japan it doesn't
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:02.560]  China you want to sell weapons you want to have destabilization you go fund
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:09.120]  radical Islam it scoops up a bunch of poor people rain washes them for 50
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.920]  years the State Department on record look at the Washington Post forget the
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.040]  exact headline it was like State Department funds radical madrasa's
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.880]  worldwide and the article admitted for you know 40 something years they done
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.240]  and now it's 50 something it showed that the the millions of books shipped to
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:28.040]  Pakistan and other areas millions that show two hand grenades plus two hand
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:36.240]  grenades equals four hand grenades and three AK-47s versus plus seven AK-47s
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:44.520]  equals 10 AK-47s and then three AK-47 clips plus nine AK-47 clips makes 12
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:50.360]  AK-47 clips I mean this is their whole and our government funds it so we can
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:56.400]  now mow them down and kill them all there it is Islamist terrorism experts
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.640]  State Department funding madrasa's in Nigeria that's a new article out of
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.200]  Breitbart last year I'm talking Washington Post 15 years ago you can
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:11.000]  pull it up but I mean see another reason the show so popular on TV especially but
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  radio as well is that if you're radio listener as I talk we've got like five
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.080]  people in there and a couple of them just sit there and type in whatever I say
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:25.040]  and then just pull up news articles and it's usually worse than I say you know I
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:31.560]  can say two hours of television viewing or more a day is linked to a
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:35.760]  multi-thousand percentage point increase in Alzheimer's and it's actually way
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:42.320]  higher than that or drinking 1.6 parts per million or 1.3 parts per million of
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.240]  fluoride for more than three years during adolescence lowers IQ on average 12
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.320]  points and we looked it up other studies said even higher I mean you know I get
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.960]  why they want to attack I mean I'm just here oh here's the flu shot insert says
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.400]  it can kill you says it can give you type 1 diabetes by destroying your
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:09.640]  pancreas here says it can cause narcolepsy yeah there it is there's the
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:16.920]  report for Congress U.S. government funding madrasas I've never even seen
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.720]  that report but pull back to that to the top police
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:27.440]  CRS report to Congress mmm Islamic religious schools madrasas background
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.160]  and our government is building billions of them a year with taxpayer money in
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.480]  the U.S. and they don't even tell people they're about to go to an Islamic school
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.480]  now there are a lot of Scientologists that set up you know these learning
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.120]  centers and all those don't tell you the Scientologists and I don't particularly
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.720]  like that but you see all these TV shows about what they're doing but but
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.360]  nothing about what the Islamics are doing and oh and the cause celeb liberals
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.080]  are just all over writing articles and just oh Alex Jones is pushing Islamophobia
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.760]  oh my gosh it's so horrible oh I'm see I'm the guy that exposed 911 before it
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.400]  happened two months before I'm the guy that exposed the dead happened I'm the
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:08.640]  guy that fought all these wars and now they want to flood us with the jihad
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.480]  fighters they've created to totally take our liberties and you're too busy going
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.760]  no there's no radical Islam no one wants to kill us Alex is lying he's a neocon
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.200]  he wants war they're gonna use these people when they start shooting and
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.160]  blowing stuff up like I told you a few years ago now it started to take our
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.320]  freedoms and launch big wars in the Middle East to kill innocent people and
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.920]  take over regimes that aren't radical and now they're blaming Assad for ISIS
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:40.480]  saying take out Assad now they're saying take over Iraq again Saudi Arabia was
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:46.400]  involved in 9-11 we attacked Iraq you sniveling leftist scum pseudo
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:50.480]  intellectuals you want to sit here and claim I don't have integrity you're the
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:57.000]  ones that don't have brains to get what's going on the globalist won our
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.560]  guns I'm against it the globalist won open borders I'm against it the globalist
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.480]  want to flood the Western world with millions of refugees a year from war
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:09.080]  torn Syria a bunch of invaders who are gonna attack us like the sun came up
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.440]  this morning and you want to shoot your mouths off and claim that I want to kill
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:18.600]  Muslims and brown people is that why I'm against the polio shot for them filled
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:26.800]  with steroids see you have to be sophisticated enough to go I don't want
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.800]  to sterilize all the Latin American women with Gardasil shots forcibly given
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.960]  to them but at the same time I don't want them to come up here and be filled
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:40.880]  full of leftist control brainwashing and vote to take my guns in a race-based
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:49.080]  politic see I love them I like them I want them to succeed I want them to be
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.480]  successful I want Mexico to be free and if it ends up being a freer and better
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:45:00.680]  country than America I'll move there I'll go be surrounded by brown people I
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:06.440]  like brown people but I just shouldn't have to sit and explain I do I'm not
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:11.200]  gonna have giant poor hordes that people brought in as a weapon by the New
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:19.880]  World Order against me and my family and it's the same thing I don't want
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:26.720]  Chechens being brought to this country they're basically Anglo-Slavic because
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:30.160]  large portions of them are terrorists and are gonna get wound up and are gonna
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.160]  attack and then my freedoms are gonna be taken and your freedoms are gonna be
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.840]  taken it's real simple oh you think I'm promoting the clash of civilizations
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:46.880]  when I popularized the white paper literally PNAC was the first to cover
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:54.920]  probably the clash of civilizations is bringing radical Muslims in to then
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.640]  demonize all other Muslims you go away the leftist talking point is all
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.600]  Muslims aren't radical a lot of them are nice this is a minority well yeah that
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.720]  part is pretty much true but what they don't tell you is they are radicalizing
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:09.480]  the Muslims and the globalists are running a program to take over the
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:13.680]  Middle East with Stone Age radical Islam
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:19.880]  revolutionary first-stage Islam going back to Muhammad when it was expanding
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:26.240]  militaristically to then have a clash crush it and crush us in the process
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.160]  with the response to it just like the globalists created the Soviet Union
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.680]  that's declassified just like they funded the whole stinking thing so that
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:38.240]  when this great evil rose up they'd have a pretext to have us counter something
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.440]  else
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.000]  let me get to something else here for just a moment and then I'm going to get

[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.240]  keep them and then they go to buy a gun a year later and they take that as an
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:14.040]  admission of guilt they go sorry you're in the next system they then put you in

[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:09.400]  Bill Clinton I'm here to tell you that I did not have sex with that woman Monica
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:16.120]  Lewinsky and I did settle was it five cases of alleged rape out of court you
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:23.480]  don't think I'd do something like that do you you know I love the fact that
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:28.800]  Trump's going after him for all the sex stuff because if Bill Cosby deserves it
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:32.440]  which he well may I think some of it's true some of it isn't but with Bill
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:37.320]  Clinton we know I mean I've interviewed the women that he well first he start
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:42.280]  choking him he'd even do it like a party or the governor's man she said step in
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.640]  here I'll talk to you in my office please ma'am and then he would get him in a
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:49.720]  closet just start choking him and then bite their upper lip while he talked
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.560]  through his mouth going here I'm gonna rip your lip off of you just resist me
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:03:02.200]  don't stand me and choke him an expert rapist but it's okay because he's liberal
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:07.000]  we imagine that he's our buddy so then everything's okay
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.160]  Cy Hurst joins us for 30 minutes coming up then Leanne McAdoo and boy do I have a
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:15.720]  lot to go over with him I want to talk about Iraqi commander claims that U.S.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:22.640]  secretly evacuating ISIS leaders to safety I want to get into Congressman
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:28.720]  Paul appalled by NSA spying on Congress and where all that is going I mean so
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.280]  much to talk about with Cy Hurst but the big thing is his new book military to
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:38.360]  military and that deals with the fact that our military has been trying as
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:44.360]  best they can under orders not to to stop the radical jihadist and of course
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.640]  the State Department wants to keep up the show that they're actually not with
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:51.240]  them so that allows that that purview even though it's a fake mission the
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:55.000]  military has actually tried to carry out the mission so we're gonna talk to the
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.880]  expert on this and of course I've got all my sources as well what's amazing is
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.760]  so much of what he's put out in the excerpt of his new book military to
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:11.400]  military backs up everything that our guest have basically talked about here
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:19.520]  on air so Cy Hurst coming up on the other side of this break remember Matt
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:22.440]  drudge was here they are pushing to control the internet they're now
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.960]  admitting that in the news that's coming up after Cy Hurst leaves us there is a
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.680]  big push to restrict free speech a big push to take over more and more of the
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:38.120]  freedoms on the internet Chinese style systems so you got to decide which side
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:46.000]  you're on right now are you on the side of basic human liberty and freedom and
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.480]  a safe society that's what's safe for freedom or you want tyranny because if
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:53.800]  you go along with this that's that's where it's headed and we already see a
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:58.560]  lot of tyranny but it's only getting worse by the middle second obviously
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:03.560]  senator Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware went on the morning Joe show
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:08.720]  to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State Coons
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:13.640]  said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:18.320]  of military force Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:23.320]  action against IS the US has spent more than five billion dollars on the war
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:28.720]  against IS since August 2014 the cost is expected to rise considerably now that
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:32.680]  the Obama administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the
[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:36.520]  group despite spending billions the air campaign has failed to weaken the
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:40.040]  Islamic State according to intelligence officials on Monday
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:44.360]  representative Peter King a New York Republican who serves as the chairman of
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:48.200]  the House Committee on Homeland Security said that after 16 months a bear
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:52.520]  strikes by the US it's had a really minimal impact on ISIS you can find

[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:49.840]  hours I mean we've only got him for like 25 minutes and I'm so excited I mean
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:53.520]  there are a lot of guests we've had to get me excited but I'm about as excited
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.600]  about this as I've ever been about any guests and maybe Donald Trump coming on
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.600]  a Ron Paul a Matt Drudge I mean it's right up there with that Seymour Hirsch
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:07.800]  I remember growing up you know at the end of the Vietnam War and hearing my
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:11.680]  mom you know talk about how great Sy Hirsch was in my dad and them reading his
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:18.600]  articles in major publications and then of course since I've been out of high
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:24.040]  school 25 years or so I'm 42 I've been following his work continually and I
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.920]  know most the audience knows who he is but I've talked to folks who don't know
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:31.920]  who Chuck Yeager is I mean it's just it's crazy how ignorant some of the public
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:38.040]  are not our general audience but the new people tuning in every millisecond on
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:42.920]  close to 200 affiliates across the United States he's won the Pulitzer Prize the
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:48.880]  National Book Award he basically helped expose the biggest massacres in
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:52.880]  Vietnam and helped pretty much cause a chain reaction that into that war you
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:55.880]  can't give him full credit for it but I could say he gets the most credit of one
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:00.240]  man or you know maybe the guy with the Pentagon Papers who's been on as well
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:05.080]  but then and I know he doesn't want to be talked about but I'm gonna do this for
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:08.120]  a minute for them we're going to him just so you know how big his new book is
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:13.080]  now important to this he exposed the Iraq war is the fraud like no other he
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:18.560]  exposed the NSA he has just exposed it all he exposed what he called one big
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.520]  lie not one word of it true there's someone been lauding raid and he has
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:27.120]  been demonized attacked you name it but the truth stands on its own that's a
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.820]  badge of courage and so we've had former NSA technical director William
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:36.160]  Benny on so many big people I don't even call Cy Hersh a whistleblower but he's
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:41.280]  beyond that he's probably undoubtedly the greatest living investigative
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:45.800]  journalist and he joins us now on his maiden voyage hopefully one of many I
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:48.920]  know we've talked an email a few times over the years and my writers have but
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:52.960]  he joins us now mr. Hersh thank you for coming on yeah but you better tell
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:58.240]  people we're not related after that introduction are you know it's true come
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:04.640]  on it you know something it's the day before do you receive it's choir here
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.840]  my office I'm sitting here like a mouse you know I don't feel so important
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:14.720]  today well it's amazing sir obviously we're here to talk about the latest
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:18.600]  info your book military to military the incredible stuff happening in
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:23.720]  Syria really showing the soul of America both good bad and ugly but first off in
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:30.280]  the continuum of your 40 plus years of reporting sir looking at all this is
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:34.600]  America getting more corrupt or less or do we just know more now or our elites
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:38.760]  getting more brazen I mean tying your latest reportage into the things you've
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:43.360]  seen what is the state of the world through your rose color darkly well you
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:48.400]  know it's interesting yes that question I would say right now that the the guys
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.360]  who control the press the ability to manipulate the press is much greater
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.400]  than ever and even the very good newspapers are you know staggering
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:03.480]  under the idea that it's just really hard to take everything at face value the
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.960]  current press secretary for the president of the United States may be a
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.320]  perfectly nice guy but he never worked as a journalist he was always a sort of a
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:14.680]  in the public relations business I'm not suggesting he's he's criminal or wrong
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:19.800]  but it we don't even have a journalist there so yes I would say things are
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.440]  worse off generally just in terms of day-to-day credibility it's just so much
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.400]  easier for the guys on top to get away with if not a falsehood just an
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.400]  incomplete answer or a non-answer when one should be issued I think it's much
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:42.520]  worse I just you know now if you go to the White House or to the Pentagon for
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.480]  comment it's sort of pro forma you're just doing it and it's aligned there the
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:51.720]  Pentagon today denied or refuse the comment you just don't get help on
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:55.080]  stories that are adverse to the government anymore
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.880]  Sy Hirsch is our guest I mean I think one of the quintessential moments was a
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:02.440]  few years ago when Gibbs had left his White House press secretary and he went
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.400]  on MSNBC and said yeah you know we knew the drone program was public and public
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:11.800]  for years but we were told to go out there and say it didn't exist this is
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:15.560]  like the Wizard of Oz and then the pundits all laughed about it it's almost
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:20.280]  like it's funny now that they've put us into a false reality they just hide it
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.360]  in plain view well you remember the president the current president joked
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:29.920]  that if you know his daughters are getting to be of dating age I mean look
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.920]  there's nothing wrong with humor but you have to sort of it was at one of
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:38.280]  these annual meetings where the national the press club give it the White House
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.240]  Correspondence Center which I think is sort of a scandal the press all like to
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:46.760]  see which guy can be at their table which person from the government and it's
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:52.880]  sort of like Kumbaya but the president actually said that guys better watch when
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:57.600]  either dating his daughters I know a very attractive woman young woman he said
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.520]  they better watch out because you can always schedule a Jones strike I thought
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:08.040]  that was wow are you kidding me you know that's over the line it seems to me it's
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.960]  not professional I mean it's like Hillary saying we came we saw he died in
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:15.520]  Libya and laughing and then did having her Brian Williams moment claiming that
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:20.960]  she was attacked in Bosnia on the tarmac none of it's true you got me and I'll
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:25.120]  tell you you're you're singing my song about Libby I just can't believe we
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:28.720]  didn't learn from that which is you know and by the way just to clear up the
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:31.640]  record the article the military to military is just an article it's a long
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:35.040]  article I wrote it's I'm doing a book but not about that I'm doing a book about
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.560]  Cheney but I did write that article for the London Review of Books which is a
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:43.560]  great magazine and you know it turns out because of what you guys do the internet
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:47.280]  you know it is so lively it doesn't really matter where you publish anymore
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:51.080]  I 30 years ago if you weren't at the New York Times you felt like you were sort of
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:54.760]  you know or the Washington Post but now you know it's just out there things get
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:59.800]  out there automatically so that's good we have more better communication I just
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:02.640]  too bad we don't have better information so that's bringing some balance back but
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:06.800]  there is a glut and I'm aware of your big book on Cheney that's coming out can't
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:11.760]  wait to see what your eye comes up with with him to really find out what this
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:16.080]  guy who works on the dark side is really all about but let's specifically get into
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:20.680]  Syria because I've had generals on colonels on lieutenant colonels on I've
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:25.160]  had CIA whistleblowers like Tosh Plum Leon but you've got obviously a lot
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.640]  better contacts than I you've been I know given security clearances before
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:33.960]  unless I'm wrong looking at all this what walking us through it sir and your
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:40.040]  incredible article military to military explain to us as best you can tell what
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.480]  has really happened in Syria well the big issue is the question one of the big
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:50.280]  questions is we've demonized the Bashar Assad he's a dictator no question you
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:54.640]  cross them he'll cross you he's a lot better than his father the old man of
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:59.920]  Assad you know his office Assad he was trained to be he was the second or
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.400]  third son never thought he'd be president because the older boys had the
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:08.320]  past went to medical school was an ophthalmologist married a very second
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:12.680]  generation Iraqi woman who worked for one of the national you know about
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:17.560]  investment houses American investment houses in London and so he was not all
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:20.520]  of a sudden there he's called upon his older brother dies and his father says
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:26.080]  you better get a couple years of army training and get ready so he's he's
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:30.560]  he's look he's hated in America I don't think you can get five votes from in
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.600]  Congress he's demonized as the killed is about 250,000 deaths but he's a lot
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:40.600]  better than Al Qaeda well you know something and ISIS and also things of
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.080]  I watched him for six eight ten years I went back and forth there I've been
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:47.560]  going there to the Middle East a lot since 9-11 and he's you know he's got
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:52.400]  much more open you could you know you could bank there you could have the you
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:58.840]  can go to an ATM machine there were 30 different foreign broadcasts on TV it
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:02.720]  was he was opening yes when you cross them he's going to fight you to the end
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:07.720]  at the war to the end he's fighting ISIS he's fighting al Qaeda he's fighting
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.440]  al-Nusra these are people that hang and in Garad some of the horrible stuff
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:16.040]  happened he's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.760]  people so it's a war in which he's killed a lot and they've killed a lot and
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:25.960]  it's a war to the end and and he's all that what I wrote about in part was that
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:31.760]  our joint chief decided some years ago on the basis of intelligence reporting
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:35.400]  that there really wasn't any option that there really were no moderate so
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:39.040]  though we give the White House keeps on talking about there are moderate groups
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.400]  in the opposition there were at one time but they were quickly quickly taken over
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:47.080]  and cleaned out by the more radicals jihadists you know people who believe
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:53.000]  in sharia law some of the groups we advocate as moderate I've already made
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.560]  it clear that if they ever took over the government no Christians or al-awaits
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:02.720]  that's a minority sect she has that the Bashar al-Assad and about 12 percent of
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:07.160]  the of the people living in Syria belong to none of them could be in could be
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.360]  allowed to live in the country they were talking about genocide of you know a
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:17.120]  genocide of cleaning the cleansing as you will of a society that those are the
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:22.320]  moderate groups so there you are so the option was the joint chiefs looking at
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:25.800]  the intelligence looking at the fact that we had been supporting for years
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:31.120]  covertly this is through the CIA David Petraeus I would argue that Hillary
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.840]  Clinton surely should have been aware of this she was Secretary of State we
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:40.360]  began them after faster Libya fell we began to funnel stuff that in an
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:45.240]  earlier article I called the rat line a lot of arms from Libya into Turkey and
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:50.320]  from Turkey the gentleman running Turkey Erdogan is a total complete
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.320]  supporter of ISIS I don't think there's any question of that even though we
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.720]  deny that our intelligence those are so what I wrote about is the fact that two
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:02.120]  and a half years ago the joint chiefs decided well they can't convince the
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.920]  White House and the State Department with intelligence they're just going to
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:11.280]  begin to do what they can do to try and modify the American policy or make it
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:16.960]  less you know they nobody wants to talk about directly challenging a president
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:21.040]  that's not your job but I will tell you at the certain level at the joint chiefs
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.520]  the level four-star general the also office is an oath to the Constitution
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:29.120]  not to the president that's right and it and it's very traditional dog but you
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:32.600]  can go back to Douglas McCarthy go back to World War two fighting you can go
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:37.080]  back to terrible fighting in Vietnam president Eisenhower as the president
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.440]  challenge the military industrial complex there's a system himself the
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:46.000]  ultimate level still a general saying I want to challenge the people that want
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.040]  to control our military for their own aims there you go there you go and you
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:54.640]  can even argue that the hatred for McNamara by the time he was ready to
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:58.200]  get out of there in 67 because he refused to listen to the generals we've
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:01.960]  always had generals in opposition so this is a new what they did though instead
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:06.680]  of directly challenging the the joint chiefs as I wrote about beginning in
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:12.320]  the summer of 9 2013 after a lot of intelligence showed that our path was
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:16.800]  wrong we weren't going to win if we got rid of Bashar we were going to have a
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:22.520]  government a completely full of wackos you know wing nuts a hard line that
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:27.360]  take off their head people clearly worse I mean a whole new Afghanistan well
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:31.480]  there you go well look Afghanistan still a mess right now you know people
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:37.240]  always talk I'm a big supporter I was in the army there's nothing better than
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:41.480]  America it's the greatest country to be in but we do have a lot of freedom and I
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:46.720]  will tell you that our special operation forces the Delta Force the seals
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.560]  they're terrific they're very good at what they do but they're being miscast
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:56.560]  this is we're now in 14 and a half years war against an idea and the joint
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.080]  special operations command for all of their ability to go hit a house at night
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:04.640]  and kill people and take them out we're not winning that war we've got to figure
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:07.800]  out some way to do it differently yes sir well Cyhurst joins us I want to go
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:10.440]  back to the bombshell you just dropped that's in your article military to
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:15.200]  military London review books and expand on this with you because what you write
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:18.240]  here and the generals you talked to and you've got the former head of Defense
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:22.160]  Intelligence Flynn and others going public on Al Jazeera saying look we were
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:28.680]  ordered to aid Al Qaeda ISIS all this this is bombshell and it verifies stuff
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:32.920]  you were writing about years ago that you were demonized over this is
[02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:37.840]  unprecedented in my lifetime to see generals on TV saying we don't want to
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:43.520]  back Al Qaeda Al Nuzra ISIS we don't know why we're being ordered to do this we
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.160]  don't know what the mission is I mean if your mission is to kill Christians then
[02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:51.440]  it works if it's not you know what's the point so you've got the high-level
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:57.120]  sources I just don't think the public realizes how seismic this is and what it
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:01.960]  symbolizes under the surface so can you speak to more of that please sir and go
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:06.680]  over to you what this means in your 40 plus years of being inside this well
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:10.320]  it was we just got we're just fighting this war wrong we're fighting it wrong
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:15.120]  we are supplying a great deal of material to people that we claim to be
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:19.120]  moderate and there's no question the first thing that happens when a small
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:25.000]  group that maybe isn't as far out as ISIS or Al Nuzra but the first thing
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.240]  they do is they have no choice either to sell it to them or get it taken away so
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:32.520]  whatever we're sending there they get bullied by the most extreme yes sir but
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.840]  when I'm getting back with you sir and I know you hold your cards close to your
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.920]  vest you just got into the Pentagon the army mainly from my sources you're
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:44.680]  confirming it saying we're not gonna back Al Qaeda Al Nuzra ISIS we're just
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:48.880]  gonna give intel to the Russians and intel to Assad and stop that that is
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:53.600]  just a huge American moment that makes me so proud of the armed services that is
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:58.560]  great well you know it's interesting what they did was because they didn't
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:02.080]  want to go directly to Bashar Assad because the president ruled that you
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.140]  know that that would have been direct violation but we did know that the
[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:09.400]  Germans in particular the German intelligence service and the German
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:15.240]  high command and get this the Russians and the Israeli all three had been in
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:20.080]  contact with Bashar Assad because all three even Israel which sometimes you
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:23.560]  know doesn't always speak what the real policy is they've got a lot of problems
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:26.560]  government problem leadership problem but the guys running the military
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.920]  intelligence system in Israel had the same point of view as our the guys
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:34.640]  running are at least that we're running our joint chiefs because the general at
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:38.120]  the time was general Dempsey they're saying Dempsey who's now retired this
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:42.200]  that he's the new chairman and we don't know where he stands on this because
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:46.120]  publicly he said little he's only a couple months into it I understand a
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:49.160]  very competent Marine they dump for it I just don't know much about him I know
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:55.200]  more about Dempsey and Dempsey the big hero in this going to Obama saying well
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:00.440]  you know he wouldn't look at it that way he just did something if the issue was
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:06.200]  we were going the wrong way the Germans and the Russians and the Israelis were
[02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:10.320]  begging for intelligence one thing America does and we do it very well we
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:14.280]  have terrific intelligence we have satellite we have singing intelligence we
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:18.080]  do have people on the ground me we could do better we can do better than than
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:22.160]  anybody wants to write about with certain groups we can penetrate people we're
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:25.920]  not we're not incompetent but often it's the leadership that gets you in
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:29.760]  trouble so they decided that the Germans in particular were kept on saying what
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:35.680]  can you do to help us they they began in the fall of night 2013 we began the
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:42.840]  shovel stuff that we had about al-Nusra al-Qaeda ISIS we began the shovel
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:47.120]  information not only about where they were but what they were thinking as much
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:52.640]  as we learned and so we enabled Bashar's army the Syrian army which right now is
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:57.280]  probably a merge and it's been fighting a tough war for four years it's emerged
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:01.920]  one of the better armies in that area a hell of a lot better armies for example
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:06.280]  in the Iraqi army right now in Afghanistan so what they did is they did it
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:10.640]  that way that way they were sort of as somebody in the article I wrote that you
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:16.000]  know the you know we're doing stuff military to military the president may
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  not have known but there's a lot of stuff he doesn't know about so that's the
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.840]  way they got around the issue and they began to help it and help Bashar not
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:26.520]  only that it was very much a morale builder for the Syrian army to know
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:32.240]  that they were getting very high-level intelligence so I don't know how he's
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:38.640]  gonna judge this as you can gather stories like this in the mainstream press
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:43.480]  don't don't get copied but it doesn't matter because there's the internet you
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:49.120]  know there's guys like you and and all sorts of other people around the world
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:53.000]  that pay more attention than often the major papers here you know I work for
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.400]  the New York Times for eight or nine years during Watergate and I went a lot
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:05.920]  of prizes in Vietnam and certainly the Nixon years a lot and one of things you
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:11.280]  know is there's not many reporters at a good newspaper who have the kind you
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:14.640]  know I there's nothing special I have friends that I know a lot most of the
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.160]  good guys that the major papers have somebody and when you're at that level
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:21.520]  where you're you know you you've got access and you're covering the Pentagon
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:24.840]  or the State Department of the White House the last thing you want to do I
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:30.080]  know this makes sounds almost silly the last thing you want to do is chase
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:33.720]  somebody else's story you just don't want to do it so when somebody has me
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:37.240]  bops along and writes the story that says something the only thing the
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:40.560]  editor can do is ask one of the good reporters to do it and what they want
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:43.600]  to do is figure out some way to get this out you know turf this get this off the
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:47.600]  desk so it doesn't really get happened doesn't happen with the papers and I
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:51.600]  understand it because I'm sure I did the same thing we're all you know we all
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:54.800]  love what we do and we're more interested ourselves and anybody else
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:57.800]  that's one of the things about my business that's sort of wacky well here's
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:01.920]  the bottom line you've had the courage and the fortitude to go through a lot I
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:04.920]  know you don't talk about this but I mean I know the stuff I've gone through I
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:07.880]  mean I could imagine and I've seen some of the news you've gone through a lot
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:12.280]  of harassment persecution to tell the truth and it's just to see the media
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.920]  today just being repeaters they take a corporate press release this pitchmen and
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.120]  just put it back out it's a very very sad I just hope that you'll join us to
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.320]  talk about your Cheney book very yeah but that's you know the problem I have
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:28.400]  with that is you know here's Cheney who's a very tough dude who decided one
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:33.040]  day after 9-11 that the rules don't apply which is you know and the thing
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:37.600]  that always interests me so much about Cheney and I'm not telegraphing that
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:43.120]  much is is is how easy it was for him to do it how he could change all the rules
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.800]  this is how it is it's just it turns out our Constitution you know which we all
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.280]  dearly think is so wonderful it's pretty flimsy it can be beaten to death very
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:59.680]  easy and that happened and so here we are we have a prison in Guantanamo that
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:03.320]  to the middle to the Arab world is a symbol of everything that's wrong with
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:07.240]  America it's so dumb it's a prison guys can go into and they disappear from
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:10.120]  there's a lot of bad guys there but there's an awful lot of good guys too
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:14.120]  guys that have nothing to do with anything weird we're being 525 we lose
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.840]  the moral high ground sir I've got to get you back up at the time I have left
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:20.080]  I've got to ask you separately you're dealing with all the things that are
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.600]  happening and the way terrorism is being used to take our freedoms bringing all
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:26.840]  these refugees in we know a lot of them are foreign fighters they're going to
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:30.560]  attack then they say oh we'll just put up naked body standards on the highway I
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:35.400]  mean isn't the war on terror a fraud because the all the funding in 15 years
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:38.760]  and we're still seeing terror attacks shouldn't we just preserve the Bill of
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:44.640]  Rights and Constitution and and not be intimidated by terror well you know I
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:47.000]  don't necessarily agree with every year saying let me make it clear because I
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.120]  have a different view on immigration I think you can do things rational things
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:54.400]  to keep just separate the good from the bad although I admit there's always a
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:58.960]  risk with everything but certainly I'll tell you we've walked away from a lot of
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:03.520]  bases and you're right one of the basic things we use it makes it easy for the
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:07.720]  government and look I know people that are very serious inside the government
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.400]  about the security risk and are scared but the bottom line is it's being used
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:18.520]  to pass laws that violates the Bill of Rights and that's I agree let's not blame
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:21.960]  the migrants and the poor war-torn folks I know I'm just saying they're gonna use
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:26.880]  this a few bad guys that come in to take our freedoms when is the Cheney

[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.760]  state policemen and the people in Virginia need to tell the governor that
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:51.200]  if you want to allow them to protect themselves they're not going to pay for

[02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:53.800]  you will find a brain force and other game-changing products at info wars
[02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:59.680]  life.com or call 888-253-3139
[02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:18.160]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones in Mexico it's known
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:24.400]  that the army is the oldest institution and also probably the most corrupt and
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:29.720]  the Marines are seen as the chivalrous group that have never really been caught
[02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:40.640]  any major corruption and they battle the army in the United States the army at
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:45.440]  least the current time are the good guys and the Navy isn't bad just the Navy's
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:49.920]  always been involved in dirtier tricks overall the Navy serves the globalist
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:54.960]  right now and that's an oversimplification you notice I hersh comes
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:59.760]  out of the army and I mean I was told this over a decade ago but I've seen it
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:04.200]  more and more I'll keep the song going with Dave Mustaine I can play the whole
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:09.440]  song he's giving me authorization play any of his music both hang here we go the
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:14.880]  darkest hour yeah let's crank it up and listen to this song but who founded the
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:22.200]  U.S. Army and from him right down to every other level there's an electrical
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:29.640]  charge to the U.S. Army George Washington my hour of need no you are not
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:49.520]  there and though I reached out to you oh this is good crank it up
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:35:02.960]  the bloodthirsty demonic Saudi Arabian leadership our military is full of a
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:09.160]  bunch of killers but I liken it to the great screenplay that was written by
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:13.720]  my favorite screenwriters he's better as a screenwriter than a director Oliver
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:27.100]  Stone you wrote Conan the Barbarian Scarface you name it in there Tony
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:30.000]  Montana's not perfect he's a man's man when it comes down to killing two
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.120]  little girls when they're driving behind the UN on boy they're about to blow his
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:37.800]  car up he looks the guy he goes you think I'm a worm like you you think I
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:45.520]  kill little kids no you die he pumps a couple rounds into his head and he ends
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.160]  up losing his life later because he did that but not his soul
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:57.880]  now I know it was you
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:09.280]  all these years
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:20.920]  now I know it was you so continuing we are at this historic crossroads right
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:28.040]  now darkest hour Dave Mustaine Megadeth yeah I'm talking all these
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:30.920]  patriots that are awake I show these Hollywood folks there's Vince Vaughn's
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:34.840]  awake to the world order the list goes on and on why do we all feel alone being
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:38.840]  against this when we really are when it comes to the intelligence to you the
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.160]  majority and we have the best minds we have the best men and women we're not
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:47.200]  cowards we don't want to screw people over we're the good guys so stop worrying
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:51.760]  about what happens to you and get involved the fight today it is the
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:58.840]  animating contest they live we sleep not really once we start living the
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:06.240]  globalist lie starts falling starts dying and tyranny and its different
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:13.520]  manifestations vanish like phantoms at dawn to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson yet
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:21.440]  again there is so much to go over did you hear Sy Hirsch he's not against
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.800]  migrants coming in but they are bringing in terrorists that are going to attack
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.720]  it'll be used to take our freedoms won't see it'd be like if I ran the water
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:35.960]  system of a major city or you ran it you're not against H2O but you want to
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:38.320]  take fluoride out because it's been admitted by Harvard and others to be
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:42.800]  toxic they're like why are you against water no I'm against fluoride or let's
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:50.600]  go one that's not debatable cyanide if they put 20 pounds of cyanide say in
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:55.800]  the hypothetically Detroit water supply that's enough to kill the whole city
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:00.880]  I'd say shut the water system off so the pipes don't flow don't tell people
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:06.440]  don't drink out of the water shut it off till you've been able to pump it out
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.360]  well that's what we're saying about the open porters people it's a globalist
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:15.040]  plan to implode the country and bankrupt it shutting off the power plants
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:21.800]  bringing in Obamacare trying to raise taxes that will blow the economy and I
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.120]  always run to business guys they go rich people like money they want a good
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:31.480]  economy feel reserve I made fifty million dollars on restaurants and car
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:36.720]  dealerships I like your show but you know I go have dinner with senators and
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:42.520]  stuff they don't want to hurt anything literally and you're sitting there
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.920]  talking to you and I go well the real rich the ultra elite let me show you
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.160]  their own white papers they want a controlled economy shut down so they
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:57.160]  can buy everything up and consolidate control when they raise taxes and
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:00.680]  everybody else they write the laws to exempt themselves well that's true I
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:05.000]  know lobbyists get that done in fact I even worked on some of them as well then
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.560]  you do know stop acting like there isn't a war stop acting like you're not under
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:15.800]  attack stop acting like it or go join the enemy just just either join the
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:24.080]  enemy and fight me or stop saying it isn't happening I respect the enemy I
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:28.680]  don't like them and I hate their guts but I respect them call you people out
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:31.960]  there that think you can sit on the sidelines for your whole life and deny
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:37.960]  any of this is going on I have had it with you and I put the call out just
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:41.160]  into cyberspace hey if you want to fight tyranny now's the time to come on the
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:49.480]  show now's the time to be counted now's the time to be heard from talk to
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.520]  Cy Hurst during the break listen you got to come back on you know want to get
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:58.120]  your info out and he goes he goes no I'm gonna come back my old lady wants me to
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:00.800]  go over here right now but we're going it's a day off we're going out to do
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:08.080]  something but he goes I know you got a lot of juice with what you're doing have
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:13.720]  a great new year Cy Hershey Nico this it was wasn't secret I was just saying I'm
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:16.440]  not gonna make the claim then I'd be back in a control room do not say that's
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:22.320]  pretty cool huh I can confirm he did say that maybe not in exactly that tone but
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:25.520]  yeah he did well he has like a New York accent I can't do it perfectly all right
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:28.480]  more like I know you got a lot of juice I mean he does kind of have a cool voice
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:32.920]  when okay well then you do the imitation what's the voice online I couldn't do
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:37.120]  better than you it kind of sounds exactly I can't do it in Cy Hershey's
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:41.400]  voice and it's not about Alex Jones whoa I'm big so I heard so much show you
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:48.240]  know confirming what we're saying it's like Gallo's humor folks it's not fun
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.520]  to have a thousand newspapers attack you and again we've become the story I
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:57.800]  never wanted to be gone so journalism but other people didn't stand up to this
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:03.680]  level and I gotta give credit where credit's due we would have grown fast
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:08.360]  not this fast but we were on that trajectory 13 14 years ago when George
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:11.600]  Norrie coast-to-coast AM had me on people could say oh well that's a show
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:14.000]  that covers all this kooky stuff well he took it in the direction where it was
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.640]  90% goofy stuff today you know 30% goofy stuff the guys a great
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:25.240]  patriot veteran himself really smart guy and that helped the show a lot and Matt
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:30.160]  Drudge you know helping link to our stories I guess Drudge has been looking
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:35.440]  to us for 10 years or more but more intensely lately and it's because he's
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:39.200]  on a journey getting more sophisticated and awake I'm way more awake than I was
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:46.720]  10 years ago Trump I mean let me tell you if Trump isn't sincere behind the
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:55.160]  scenes then I've been fooled and I don't get fooled a lot I think Trump could be
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:59.560]  dangerous for the wrong advisors I think Trump is a wild man a Trump is
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:02.840]  definitely his own person and Trump does not like watching this country get
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:07.240]  messed up he kind of thinks of it as like you know part of himself it's
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.400]  loyalty and a lot of these sociopaths people go oh you're loyal to the country
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:16.920]  you're loyal to rules you're just a week cuz you're loyal no loyalty is an
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:22.880]  ingrained genetic trait to not live in squalor you people that think you're
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:27.520]  smart cuz you lie all the time or you're smart cuz you're not loyal you
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:34.040]  don't even get to experience what real life's all about and that's why the
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:37.560]  globalists are destined to fail they are disloyal they're pretty loyal to their
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:42.880]  own top group but I mean you can't be disloyal to humanity long term and not
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:46.960]  get screwed over by it and so I got stacks of news here but I mean so much of
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:54.720]  this is metaphysical I mean I can get John Harmon on the air right now John
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:57.080]  don't know if you're gonna remember this you remember the last time I asked you
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:00.400]  about a five years ago it was like ten years ago nine years ago the head of
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.360]  the Kissinger group Roth Copson he's written the book super class I'm
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:10.360]  chilling into him and during a break and John's listen during the break John's
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:17.520]  up in Minnesota but we have double backup I just like to run the show and he
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:22.960]  was running the show that day and I come on and I go do you think I'm Alex S
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:26.480]  Jones the Shorenstein's tenor the New York Times family because why are you
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.920]  coming on tell me how global government's good and world government's great and
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.480]  all this stuff he goes no I know you're Alex Jones of Info Wars I thought I was
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:35.240]  nice to you you might want to work with us and be part of this because you're
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:38.760]  part of the super class and you could join us of course I've been given these
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:43.920]  speeches by fortune 500 heads and you know people years ago but he was doing
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:49.680]  it on a live line and then he came back another break he goes listen there's no
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:52.520]  point in this I can see you're not gonna blah blah blah but I mean they were
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:55.480]  ready folks to basically say why don't you come up to the council on farm
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:00.520]  relations in New York City I could go in and you know I guess Richard Haas might
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:04.600]  come in I could have lunch and then oh you know if I really kissed their butt
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:08.920]  for a few years I can have dinner with Henry Kissinger but what does that do I
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:15.320]  want to promote freedom I don't want to be accepted by a dying dinosaur group
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:23.040]  that hijacked America and then thinks it made America you didn't make America you
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:27.640]  didn't build this country you're not invincible you don't control reality
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:32.800]  you're not history's actors got it what you're gonna do is start nuclear war
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:36.920]  with the Russians why would you want to overthrow Assad when he was already
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.240]  westernizing and why would you overthrow Gaddafi when he was vested all his money
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:45.360]  with you and you set him up because you don't want anybody influenced in Africa
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:49.560]  you don't control you want that place in squalor and falling apart so you can
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:55.120]  buy everything up cheap I just don't like that attitude it's a looting evil
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:59.960]  attitude and I'm not at some bleeding heart liberal if somebody pushes
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:03.080]  American interest around someone wants to mess with us I'm like Thomas Jefferson
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:10.760]  sending the Marines and kill everybody but we don't start fights and we don't
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:15.160]  pull false flags and claim somebody else started it bullying a bunch of Iraqis is
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.520]  not what I stand for and the real warriors that defend this country are
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:23.560]  sick of it they feel bad about what's happened they know the truth now and I
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:27.000]  know I'm communicating directly with the criminals in the government right now
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.240]  like I'm a cop with a bullhorn outside you know the house you got hostages
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:34.280]  you're holding America the World Hostage and I'm out here in the patrol car
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:38.400]  behind the door going you'll never get away with it everybody's starting to
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:42.840]  realize what you've done the best thing you can do is just stop now before you
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:45.480]  and others get hurt
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:57.360]  it's a total con game these people shouldn't be in control we can make
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:46:00.360]  mistakes a hundred years ago folks 50 years ago we can't deal with the weapons
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:06.520]  now it just has to stop and all these billionaires trying to get to Mars I
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.840]  think the earth's gonna get blown up does that give you confidence and they
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:13.400]  write all these white papers and articles about yeah we've decided to kill
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:19.080]  everybody trying to warn you build joy and countless other papers yeah I went
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:23.200]  to a conference of 200 top tech owners and the consensus was we're not going
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:26.520]  to just let everybody play video games and virtual reality they're gonna build
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:33.520]  a system and then kind of face humans out I I think you might want to know
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:40.440]  about this I mean again and then they can get riders at the Texas Tribune and
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:44.240]  the Austin American Statesmen locally and the Austin Chronicle and nationally
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:48.680]  every paper there is to just write articles attacking me when all I want
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:53.040]  is to not blow the planet up and then all the other intellectual people all the
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:56.920]  other intelligence operatives the other brass the other people they are all
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:01.720]  saying the same thing I mean you people are crazy you understand you're nuts
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:08.360]  you're nuts Samantha Powers and all these weird feminists who are all about
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:12.400]  women's power so the media says it's okay they're launching wars they're women
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:16.400]  and then it's real freakish they've never been in the military they don't it's
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:22.280]  just weird it's just it just stinks of failure it stinks of falling it stinks
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:25.640]  of disaster I'm not against women but there's articles where they're gonna
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:28.520]  make the packs half the size of the army and the Marines they're gonna let a
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:35.240]  woman fail her fireman test fire person test in New York because she failed it
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:39.480]  six times she can just not have to be able to climb or pick things up oh yeah
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:48.440]  we need we five foot tall firefighters that they can't pick people up I mean
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:56.120]  we gonna ban women having babies because men can't have them it's freakish it's
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:00.320]  garbage and the elite are conquering us by making us dumb and stupid and
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:06.280]  sabotaging everything while they're sabotaging themselves the US military
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:09.960]  doesn't want to be replaced with robots they don't be like crap as soon as they
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:16.320]  get out the sack of it and you people can't deal with the fact just like Dr.
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:20.120]  Pachinic said that I'm I'm nobody special but I do have the spirit of 1776
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:26.880]  I'm not afraid I'm my most alive when I'm in my greatest danger and it's a
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:32.800]  spirit and it spreads and that's the only reason they haven't cut me down
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.400]  because just the drops I've been putting out are causing them big problems
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:43.400]  just like that Texas backbeat can we come back the next segment with the
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:49.800]  Texas radio the doors and that's exactly what Pachinic said who's
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:54.280]  overthrown probably eight different governments he said in full wars out of
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:59.040]  the south out of the swamps out of that out of the guts out of all the dead
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:03.760]  natives and the dead whites and the dead blacks and the war and the savagery and
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:08.400]  the voodoo and all the rest of it the south nothing like it what it's gone
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:12.040]  through nothing like it what it's done out of that out of Americana out of all
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:21.960]  of that comes oozing the resistance to being a slave the Texas big beat and
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:29.360]  we're just one part of it but we are a model of what will smash the enemy so
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:32.640]  they're sitting there looking at this big tank of resistance and they want to
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:35.720]  cut it they want to stab it they want to burn it they want to shoot the moon
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:43.040]  they can't they can take a sledgehammer to me anytime they want but what comes
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:47.640]  out it's like killing one of the aliens an alien what comes out what's the blood
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:55.320]  made out of what's the blood do sends them straight to hell the tree of
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:50:01.800]  liberty is watered with the blood of patriots first and the blood of
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:06.560]  tyrants and I don't have a death wish far from it I love life so much I'm
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.440]  willing to lay it down for freedom so that others got a chance to do
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:14.520]  incredible stuff and I want them to do what it takes to lay down their lives
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:18.080]  when the time comes to build something really great because I stand on the
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:21.760]  shoulders of my ancestors just like you do and I get those of you that don't
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:24.000]  resonate with that that don't have that background that don't have that
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.960]  spiritual connection I get why you serve your master it's all you've ever known
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:33.800]  but I'm not calling for you because you're not gonna hear I'm calling for
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.920]  those that want to build something greater I'm calling for those that want
[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:43.480]  to be strong and who don't mind somebody else being successful I'm calling for
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:49.440]  people that are fans of humanity stand up against the New World Order and truly
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:55.480]  bring in the enlightened it'll take us to the next level in God's plan stay

[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:43.320]  that's when i was 12 years old riding a dirt bike with a walkman on
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:47.880]  ha ha ha all right let's get serious
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:52.760]  you have to choose which side you're on i just keep going back to that
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:59.000]  and that's the point that we've reached and i knew exposing Benghazi
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:04.040]  and actually strategically not tuning my horn
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:08.040]  with others about it that it would move into something over time that would
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:11.800]  really cripple the whole globalist operation if it started coming out
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:16.440]  and now it's coming out and and so i will raise a toast to everybody
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:19.560]  on new year's eve i tend to do a facebook mentions
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:22.360]  for everyone that stood up against tyranny that spread the word that sent
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:25.240]  links out that told their friends and family about what was happening
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:29.400]  because whether it's them coming for our guns or trying to get rid of our
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:32.600]  borders or funding al-qaeda and others to
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:36.200]  commit atrocities against innocent muslims and christians
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:39.240]  so many good things are happening right now
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:41.560]  and
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:46.360]  i go back to the best of times worst of times at least we're in the fight now
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:50.680]  and it is exciting and so there's all this other stuff
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:54.440]  happening and they're coming for our freedoms and it's undoubted
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:57.960]  but they're hurried because they're behind schedule and they meant to have a
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:00.680]  financial collapse set up to consolidate power bringing a
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:03.560]  casual society the problem is their system isn't fully
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:07.000]  in place yet but still it's melting down because they don't fully control it
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:10.200]  they just kind of steer it they're trying to hurt cats
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:14.600]  and their whole program is starting to unravel right now
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:19.880]  and it's unraveling in a big way but out of that chaos they're going to try to
[02:58:19.880 --> 02:58:22.840]  bring in their control we have to use the chaos
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:26.520]  now the people are paying attention to point out that they fundamentally
[02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:31.240]  create chaos as if there isn't enough of it to pose as the controllers and the
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:34.840]  saviors because if you expose their paradigm their
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:37.880]  whole system goes down you're either totally awake or
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:40.600]  totally dumb i mean it really comes down to that

[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:13.640]  there over the decades are just a lot of reports on hillary clinton
[03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:17.080]  and her husband bill a lot of things that the media the
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:21.400]  establishment media would really just wish would go away
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:26.440]  and you could really see i would say the hubris of hillary clinton just
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:29.640]  truly thinking that 20 years passage of time
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:34.280]  would have just wiped out uh the indecency of her husband
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:37.560]  she really was betting on that as she put out that
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:42.520]  video saying all sexual assault accusers we should believe them you
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:45.800]  deserve to be heard and as soon as she said that people were like
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:52.920]  what are you kidding me you famously tried to defame multiple women who came
[03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:56.600]  after your husband so that's one thing i really want to get into
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:00.280]  here in this segment because as i was looking at the
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:03.560]  uh the drudge report today one of the articles that caught my eye
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:08.920]  was one from the daily beast why is matt drudge boosting donald trump
[03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:12.840]  and this writer is just basically lamenting the fact that matt drudge
[03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:16.440]  would dare go against the establishment media and support
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:20.520]  someone like the donald why isn't he supporting clinton like
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:25.640]  everyone else why are you know why is he posting all these articles and of
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:28.600]  course they go on um and saying you know if you thought
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:31.960]  drudge wasn't important because he doesn't make headlines anymore you were
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:36.520]  wrong he has 700 million visitors a month matt drudge
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:40.680]  is huge and he's still very relevant and so they go on and they try to sort of
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:44.840]  make fun of him because he he aggregates news from all
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:48.680]  over the world things that don't seemingly have a political
[03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:51.880]  slant but of course they do because that's what drudge
[03:11:51.880 --> 03:11:56.840]  does and what he does so well is he pulls things in from all over the
[03:11:56.840 --> 03:12:00.840]  world to tie it all in together to show you how this
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:05.000]  agenda is truly a global one and he exposes that
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:09.240]  and that's why so many people rely on the drudge report to get their news
[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:13.160]  because he goes from all over the place he doesn't just pick and choose
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:16.920]  one angle and he basically turns this slavish
[03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:21.480]  establishment media on its head so with that in mind
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:25.960]  with uh with him you know how dare he boost donald trump
[03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:31.320]  let's look at how the mainstream media has tried to rally around bill clinton
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:35.560]  in light of donald trump going off on bill clinton's
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:39.640]  penchant for sexism of course he's come out now and said hillary started it
[03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:42.760]  you know she was the one that said i have the penchant for sexism
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:45.880]  just thinking that we're going to sweep under the rug all of her husbands in
[03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:51.880]  discussions so last week cnn and this is a woman on cnn
[03:12:51.880 --> 03:12:56.760]  um we'll go ahead and get that clip ready but she actually posed this question
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:01.080]  there to another few women on the panel let's go ahead and play this clip
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:04.760]  we set the record straight uh is bill clinton
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:11.640]  sexist or just he's simply like women that he had so many high powered women
[03:13:11.640 --> 03:13:14.600]  in his cabinet everybody from uh you know uh
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:17.560]  ruth bader ginsburg who we appointed to the stream court but then
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:21.320]  he had attorney general janet reno secretary of state madeline albright
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:26.280]  donna shellala so uh is he sexist is that a fair
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:32.920]  oh really is bill clinton sexist or does he simply like women
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:37.080]  are you kidding me what happened to the war on women what happened to the rape
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:40.200]  culture that the left is always wanting to push out there
[03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:43.080]  so of course they're going on to talk about how he has all these women in his
[03:13:43.080 --> 03:13:46.120]  cabinet well obviously these were you know older
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:49.800]  women janet reno come on it's probably not someone he wanted to sexually
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:53.960]  harass um but you notice how she didn't point out
[03:13:53.960 --> 03:13:56.920]  any of the women who you know let's ask uh
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:00.920]  eileen wellstone or wanita broadrick or jennifer flowers how
[03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:04.200]  they feel does does does bill clinton just simply
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:08.840]  like you now these are just some of the sexual stories and allegations besides
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:13.080]  bill clinton's affair with his former intern so eileen wellstone
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:18.520]  she claims that clinton raped her in 1969 so i mean that's going decades back
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:22.520]  wanita broadrick that was in 1978 jennifer flowers
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:25.240]  she claims she was his mistress for 12 years
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:28.680]  kathleen willie wiley she was a former white house aide
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:32.520]  she claimed clinton sexually assaulted her in 1993
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:36.760]  paula jones sued clinton for sexual harassment in 94
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:40.120]  that lawsuit was dropped because there was an eight hundred and fifty thousand
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:43.560]  dollar out-of-court settlement that was reached
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:49.000]  so these are just a few there are many more allegations from women
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:52.680]  you know but here we have cnn coming out saying
[03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:56.600]  doesn't he just like women i mean is that really sexist of him
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:14:59.880]  how can trump say this then of course we have the
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:03.240]  chair the dnc chair debbie wasterman schultz coming out
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:05.960]  saying anyone that wants to come after bill clinton
[03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:10.760]  attack him at your own peril and she's just going on the defensive here saying
[03:15:10.760 --> 03:15:14.920]  polls show that he could be reelected right now he's one of the most revered
[03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:19.960]  politicians or men to this day so she's basically saying it's okay to sexually
[03:15:19.960 --> 03:15:23.240]  assault women and still be revered in that party
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:27.480]  of course we saw don lemon shut off someone's microphone who dared
[03:15:27.480 --> 03:15:30.760]  talk about bill clinton um and then this week
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:36.120]  nbc news is savannah guthrie tried to frame bill clinton's affair with monica
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:42.120]  lawinsky as an alleged affair alleged incident and donald trump schulder on it
[03:15:42.120 --> 03:15:45.560]  she was like you mentioned monica lawinsky are you saying an alleged
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:48.760]  extramarital affair well that of course he's now admitted is
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:52.520]  is that fair game and trump that's what i like about him he's sharp he doesn't
[03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:56.280]  let the media run away with that he says was that actually an alleged
[03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:59.080]  affair um you know he's admitted it and she said
[03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:02.360]  well yeah you're right he's admitted it and he's like you don't have to use the
[03:16:02.360 --> 03:16:06.360]  word alleged and so that's i mean that's just
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:10.760]  evidence of how the media is trying to paint this and paint people into a
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:13.880]  corner and get them to say this story sort of how
[03:16:13.880 --> 03:16:18.440]  they would like to uh to spin it and then of course we've got this
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:22.520]  article out of breitbart breitbart bill versus bill one is
[03:16:22.520 --> 03:16:26.840]  hunted down one is celebrated and this is actually an
[03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:30.520]  article from last year they they thought it would be pertinent to go
[03:16:30.520 --> 03:16:35.880]  ahead and uh repost it with some minor edits but of
[03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:39.160]  course you know right now and cnn they're talking about how bill
[03:16:39.160 --> 03:16:44.200]  kosby is about to uh be arraigned he's now being charged with uh drugging and
[03:16:44.200 --> 03:16:48.920]  raping a woman i think in 2004 and so there just this is all over the news
[03:16:48.920 --> 03:16:54.440]  but no one is going back they don't want to talk about bill clinton
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:57.960]  and you know this just goes on to describe
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:01.240]  the women that i've mentioned uh earlier Juanita Broderick
[03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:06.760]  charges of rape um but it's not it's not just that the more important issue is
[03:17:06.760 --> 03:17:13.240]  the fact that hillary clinton is charged uh she stands accused
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:16.600]  actually of defaming threatening and attempting to personally
[03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:21.160]  destroy these women bill's bimbos right that was the bimbo
[03:17:21.160 --> 03:17:25.560]  eruptions is that famously came out of her camp so this is a woman who's
[03:17:25.560 --> 03:17:31.800]  trying to portray her whole campaign uh as a defender of women's rights and
[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:36.520]  she famously was going after these women attacking them she um tried to
[03:17:36.520 --> 03:17:40.600]  destroy Monica Lewinsky who was like 21 years old at the time
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:46.120]  painting her as a crazed liar and stalker the dc media was all too happy to
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:50.200]  to go along with that portrayal um and that was of course before
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:53.960]  Monica Lewinsky was able to provide some dna evidence
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:56.760]  so they you know destroyed this woman and of course that was where
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:01.960]  judge really um came out with that story was the one to break that
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:08.040]  but uh they also with Juanita Broderick she was reluctant to file a lawsuit she
[03:18:08.040 --> 03:18:11.800]  wasn't like bill cosby's accusers she didn't even want to go public with all
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:15.960]  of this but it didn't matter the media went out of their way to discredit her
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:20.840]  dismiss her as a liar a tool of the right um and old news
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:24.760]  paula jones um this is the lady that settled out of court
[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:29.800]  they smeared her as trailer trash um one of bill clinton's operatives said hey
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:33.240]  well if you drag a hundred dollar bill through the trailer park you never know
[03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:36.440]  what you're gonna get so i mean this was the way that they were attacking
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:40.760]  women and then that's the real war on women right and so it's just pretty
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:47.320]  interesting to see how they are rallying around bill clinton when they
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:51.000]  you know we saw this with obama where they were trying to play the race card
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:54.120]  we knew they were going to play the gender card with clinton
[03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:57.960]  and i mean this is why the establishment media is dying
[03:18:57.960 --> 03:19:02.120]  because their hypocrisy their lies all their blatant propaganda is just
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:05.720]  being thrown in their face you can't lie to people anymore especially not when
[03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:10.520]  you have the internet which is of course why they want to shut it down
[03:19:10.520 --> 03:19:13.720]  and even the wall street journal is coming out today saying
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:18.680]  if hillary plays the sexism card then bill's behavior is fair game
[03:19:18.680 --> 03:19:22.920]  and they're calling it the clinton war on women and calling out how she and her
[03:19:22.920 --> 03:19:27.240]  allies are going to try to spin any criticism as sexist
[03:19:27.240 --> 03:19:30.840]  so that i think is just key right there
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:34.520]  no one's going to lay down and take this anymore everyone's just saying look
[03:19:34.520 --> 03:19:37.880]  if it's fair game you want to play dirty well
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:40.920]  clearly trump is going to play dirty too so
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:44.200]  there you go and you know i think that's pretty important
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:49.080]  well coming up we are going to talk about potential politicians wearing
[03:19:49.080 --> 03:19:53.160]  logos in california wouldn't that be great trump came out and admitted that
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:56.600]  he pays off politicians to do what he wants all the time so it'll be
[03:19:56.600 --> 03:20:01.400]  interesting to see if he wears a logo winter has just begun and are you

[03:24:16.520 --> 03:24:20.520]  hour overdrive rob do will be joining me in studio here in the next segment we're
[03:24:20.520 --> 03:24:23.480]  going to be talking about uh some states violating
[03:24:23.480 --> 03:24:28.280]  dna privacy rights by taking infant blood draws a lot of parents aren't even
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:31.000]  aware of this uh so we'll be talking about that as
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:35.080]  well as some proposed changes there with the tsa
[03:24:35.080 --> 03:24:39.960]  now coming out of california we you know we talk about this we joke about this
[03:24:39.960 --> 03:24:44.280]  all the time whenever we are covering the the debates or when someone's
[03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:48.360]  getting up there running for president they should be forced to wear
[03:24:48.360 --> 03:24:52.520]  logos just like nas car race race car drivers how they have to show
[03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:59.880]  everyone who has sponsored their team and now that could be a reality in california
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:03.400]  this is a group california is not for sale
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:07.640]  and they are trying to get a potential ballot measure submitted
[03:25:07.640 --> 03:25:12.600]  for the 2016 election and the group is pretty pretty certain that they're
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:16.280]  going to have some luck with this so let's go ahead and play a little bit of
[03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:21.480]  this news clip out of abc 10 news in san diego when we see race car drivers
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:26.200]  there's no mistaking that sponsors make nas cars wheels go round
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:29.720]  imagine if our politicians had to do the same if they don't take any money they
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:33.480]  won't have to wear any stickers local entrepreneur john cox wants california
[03:25:33.480 --> 03:25:37.560]  state assembly members and senators to display their top 10 donors
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:41.560]  anytime they speak on the floor just like these life-sized cutouts he's
[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:44.840]  displayed in front of the county building and on the steps of the state
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:47.720]  capital they're covered in corporate and union
[03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:53.320]  logos it's a corrupt system and it's got to change
[03:25:53.320 --> 03:25:57.400]  i'm sorry wreck and if you were help i think
[03:25:57.400 --> 03:26:00.920]  many of them most of them are probably good people but they're caught in the
[03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:04.680]  club interesting to see how many for the effort to recall former bob
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:08.200]  filner now he's paying for this new campaign he calls
[03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:12.200]  california is not for sale these people are not going to change it on their own
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:16.360]  senator marty block says he supports reasonable measures to provide more
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:20.840]  transparency to our legislative process assembly member rocky chavez agrees
[03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:24.120]  adding we should maintain some professionalism on the assembly floor
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:29.400]  though to have everybody decked out as race car drivers i think would be uh
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:34.360]  circus which wouldn't really benefit the public in january cox will start
[03:26:34.360 --> 03:26:37.880]  collecting the required 365 000 signatures statewide
[03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:41.160]  i actually think that this idea would be so popular that we'll get
[03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:45.800]  three million signatures if all goes his way californians will vote on this
[03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:51.240]  next november robert septos ten years so that was i mean
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:55.320]  just a really incredible idea whose time has come
[03:26:55.320 --> 03:27:00.200]  and in response to chavez's claim that this would be a circus element there on
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:04.280]  the legislature uh cox responded you know it's a circus
[03:27:04.280 --> 03:27:08.440]  that politicians can openly take money from corporations and unions
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:12.280]  and have no accountability afterwards it's a complete joke
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:15.720]  if mr chavez doesn't like this i have a brilliant solution for him
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:20.920]  stop taking money and this is all a movement to get big money out of politics
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:23.800]  obviously it's not nothing is going to change if there
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:27.960]  there isn't some forced accountability and obviously they're already trying to
[03:27:27.960 --> 03:27:30.840]  see if donald trump will get on board with this
[03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:35.320]  i think that would be pretty hilarious and you know if you look at the pictures
[03:27:35.320 --> 03:27:39.160]  of those life-size cutouts it they weren't just sticking
[03:27:39.160 --> 03:27:43.320]  logos on them willy nilly these were actual logos i mean these were actual
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:47.560]  people who are sponsoring these politicians and so you you know for
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:50.920]  instance in california you've got your mandatory vaccination
[03:27:50.920 --> 03:27:54.120]  uh bill being pushed there and some of the senators that were
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:59.800]  behind this push to uh have mandatory vaccines
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:03.480]  we're getting money from big pharma they were getting money from a lot of drug
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:06.200]  companies or they had stocks or investments
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:10.920]  within uh you know the mmri or things these vaccines and so
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:15.080]  you know if you're going to force the population to have to take
[03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:18.600]  one of your products because that's what a vaccine is
[03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:21.640]  well then you should be forced to let people know
[03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:24.920]  who is behind you who's behind the push for the gun grab
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:29.400]  and things like that so visit their website california is not for sale dot
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:32.040]  com they say this to show how you can get
[03:28:32.040 --> 03:28:36.120]  involved with this measure they need to get i believe 350
[03:28:36.120 --> 03:28:40.600]  thousand signatures in order to get this on the ballot for 2016
[03:28:40.600 --> 03:28:45.560]  but how incredible would that be i think we need to make this a nationwide
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:48.520]  movement hopefully we can get this uh passed
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:52.840]  in time for the next election in four years
[03:28:52.840 --> 03:29:00.040]  so that is california is not for sale now uh one thing we've learned today of
[03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:04.040]  course we knew that the nsa has been spying on all the rest of america
[03:29:04.040 --> 03:29:08.680]  but they're actually spying on congress as well as some of their allies and
[03:29:08.680 --> 03:29:12.520]  foreign dignitaries and any conversations that they have
[03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:16.280]  um with those foreign dignitaries and congress so
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:20.280]  what i think paul uh ran paul has actually come out saying he's
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:24.280]  appalled by this and we need some more controls on our intelligence agencies
[03:29:24.280 --> 03:29:28.280]  but what are they thinking they're treating us all the same
[03:29:28.280 --> 03:29:31.480]  we're all in this together they're not exempt from
[03:29:31.480 --> 03:29:36.040]  the eye of sauron and um i think they're starting to realize that
[03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:40.280]  and uh we also have another story of spy agencies resisting the push to
[03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:44.360]  expand scrutiny of their top employees so
[03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:50.600]  they don't want anyone spying on them we're on the march the empires on the
[03:29:50.600 --> 03:30:00.920]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.920 --> 03:30:04.520]  republican legislators are threatening to remove virginia governor terry mccullough's
[03:30:04.520 --> 03:30:07.800]  protection detail the democrat governor former campaign
[03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:11.560]  manager for hillary clinton and his attorney general are eager to enact

[03:30:15.400 --> 03:30:19.080]  so attorney general herring announced that he would no longer recognize
[03:30:19.080 --> 03:30:23.640]  concealed carry permits from 25 states just like that
[03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:27.800]  one guy tells the most law-abiding most vetted people
[03:30:27.800 --> 03:30:31.560]  you can no longer protect yourself protect your family
[03:30:31.560 --> 03:30:35.000]  he implies these 25 other states don't have the same standards of background
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:39.320]  checks that virginia does not true so republicans in the virginia
[03:30:39.320 --> 03:30:43.000]  legislature are saying if the governor is so afraid of guns
[03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:46.520]  we're not going to surround him with armed state policemen and the people in
[03:30:46.520 --> 03:30:49.880]  virginia need to tell the governor that if you want to allow them to protect
[03:30:49.880 --> 03:30:54.600]  themselves they're not going to pay for him to be protected by an army of body

[03:33:31.320 --> 03:33:35.400]  joining me now is rob dew obviously our nightly news
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:39.000]  director in here with some pretty interesting news
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:42.680]  first i wanted to go ahead and complete the story i was getting to right before
[03:33:42.680 --> 03:33:47.480]  the break about the spy agencies resisting push for expanded scrutiny of
[03:33:47.480 --> 03:33:51.720]  their top employees so what was happening uh these u.s
[03:33:51.720 --> 03:33:55.240]  intelligence agencies they promised to be more open
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:34:00.280]  and accountable and uh so there was a move by congress that would require the cia
[03:34:00.280 --> 03:34:04.520]  and other spy services to disclose more details about their high-ranking
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:10.280]  employees but of course this was met with a lot of opposition from the
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:13.320]  director of national intelligence james clapper
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:17.640]  and so the wording was watered down and now check this out
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:21.880]  now the modified language will ensure that oversight committees
[03:34:21.880 --> 03:34:25.320]  know the names of senior intelligence community
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:28.760]  leaders so that was their big win is that now
[03:34:28.760 --> 03:34:31.800]  they can't the oversight committees who are wanting to look
[03:34:31.800 --> 03:34:36.680]  and see uh these senior officers who are being promoted to even higher levels
[03:34:36.680 --> 03:34:39.320]  of office higher positions despite having all
[03:34:39.320 --> 03:34:43.240]  these problems abusive treatment to botched operations
[03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:47.480]  but they're still getting promoted um well the oversight committees are
[03:34:47.480 --> 03:34:52.600]  now allowed to know their names so don't look at us while we look at you
[03:34:52.600 --> 03:34:56.120]  yeah that's how much control congress has over the cia
[03:34:56.120 --> 03:34:59.720]  and these other agencies that was just shocking to me it's just like
[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:03.880]  what a joke what a joke they really are ineffectual puppets
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:07.880]  yeah so while we were coming in uh people were listening to the bumper music
[03:35:07.880 --> 03:35:11.560]  that was lemmy from motorhead playing ace of spades singing ace of spades and
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:15.320]  he died uh on monday and i mean the guy was pretty
[03:35:15.320 --> 03:35:19.080]  much a train wreck if you look at it his life but he did exactly what he wanted
[03:35:19.080 --> 03:35:25.480]  to do he drank uh that massive amounts of of bourbon every day
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:28.200]  i think he switched to vodka towards the end of his life
[03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:31.720]  uh took you know took a bunch lsd partied lived the life
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:36.120]  of a rock and roll star embodied the life of a of a rock star
[03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:39.320]  and you know i'm not i don't want to come here and celebrate his life and what
[03:35:39.320 --> 03:35:42.920]  he did the one thing i do want to say though is he was an individual and here
[03:35:42.920 --> 03:35:45.960]  was a guy who found that he had terminal cancer
[03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:49.240]  just two days before he died so he was living his life
[03:35:49.240 --> 03:35:53.320]  the way he wanted to live it not worried about you know his health and doing
[03:35:53.320 --> 03:35:55.720]  all these other things and not being bogged down by all that just living
[03:35:55.720 --> 03:35:59.320]  his life putting out albums put out 23 albums yeah motorhead
[03:35:59.320 --> 03:36:02.520]  he started the band when he was 30 right that he famously said if you think
[03:36:02.520 --> 03:36:07.560]  you're too old for rock and roll then you are exactly and you know just
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:11.240]  just the fact that in you know we're coming up on a new year 2016
[03:36:11.240 --> 03:36:14.840]  and to not worry so much about what other people are doing
[03:36:14.840 --> 03:36:18.040]  do what you're gonna do you know whether it's
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:21.560]  i'm gonna make the best website i'm gonna be a reporter i'm gonna be a video
[03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:24.040]  editor i'm gonna go shoot awesome stills of nature
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:27.480]  and i'm gonna make the best memes and put them on twitter do that
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:30.760]  don't worry about what everybody else is doing or if you're doing it as good as
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:32.760]  them let me wasn't the best bass player wasn't the
[03:36:32.760 --> 03:36:35.480]  best singer wasn't the best songwriter but he did it
[03:36:35.480 --> 03:36:39.960]  he just went and did it every day and i think his last concert was in december
[03:36:39.960 --> 03:36:43.240]  11th in europe so less than a month later he was
[03:36:43.240 --> 03:36:45.560]  dead of terminal cancer but he was still living it
[03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:49.720]  had it so wasn't keeping him down he wasn't using that like oh i have cancer
[03:36:49.720 --> 03:36:52.120]  you know i was reading another story there's some country star who's been
[03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:54.440]  living in a hospice for months trying to just
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:36:57.560]  keep going and pretty much when you go to hospice that's the last room you're
[03:36:57.560 --> 03:37:00.920]  going to see that's right but she's up and she's doing stuff but she's also
[03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:04.200]  being affected by all these cancer treatments and everything else
[03:37:04.200 --> 03:37:07.640]  and i mean do you want is it worth that you know will people go take these
[03:37:07.640 --> 03:37:11.160]  cancer treatments is it worth you know the
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:14.200]  those are your last moments right do you want to live or do you want to just
[03:37:14.200 --> 03:37:17.560]  live a full life like well let me did he lived a full life up until he died
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:20.680]  yeah so that's really what i want to say about
[03:37:20.680 --> 03:37:24.520]  that i was thinking about this i'm like ah you know here's an individual
[03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:28.520]  we celebrate individualism here this was an individual he was weird
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:32.600]  you know that should be something not necessarily the actions he was taking but
[03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:36.760]  the spirit of being an individual and not looking to be
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:41.880]  society's norms yeah and living your life right he just did his thing
[03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:45.640]  up up until he died so yeah i want to commend him for that and
[03:37:45.640 --> 03:37:49.240]  you know his musical r.i.p let me there you go
[03:37:49.240 --> 03:37:55.080]  and now on to the other t.s.a you know now they they we're going to go traveling
[03:37:55.080 --> 03:37:59.640]  in a few days and we're going to obviously i'm going to opt out yeah just
[03:37:59.640 --> 03:38:02.200]  you know even though well we're going to give them a test case see if they're
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:05.480]  going to allow me to opt out that should be interesting
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:08.600]  but what they've also done now they're going to say
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:12.760]  that there's this thing came out i think in 2005 they passed the real id act
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:17.480]  on uh the recommendations of the um 9-11 commission they said we need to do
[03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:21.000]  this coordinate all the ids of all the states together into a
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:24.040]  central database you know that could be hacked
[03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:29.320]  to stop the terrorists right so but it nobody's made this this has not been
[03:38:29.320 --> 03:38:31.800]  laws hasn't been put into practice yet but now
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:34.840]  there's there's the new york times t.s.a moves closer to rejecting
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:38.200]  some state driver's license for travel so you may have to have your passport
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:43.240]  or another form of approved id uh because there's some states washington state
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:45.560]  they don't have the chip they don't have the chip in them
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:48.600]  so they and they so they don't sync up that's one of the things is that they
[03:38:48.600 --> 03:38:51.800]  have to have some sort of be able to be read by a machine
[03:38:51.800 --> 03:38:55.000]  one of the other stipulations that has to sink into a database
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:58.040]  right and we're about fingerprints because here when i moved to texas i was
[03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:01.400]  like what are you taking my fingerprints yeah they they do the thumb
[03:39:01.400 --> 03:39:06.840]  scan in fact we're about to go to a clip of a very young alex jones
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:12.920]  17 18 maybe even 19 years ago a little baby going in and fighting this very
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:17.160]  thing that we're talking about now you know in 2015 he was doing it in like
[03:39:17.160 --> 03:39:20.200]  98 bill clinton was still in office it was 98 or 99
[03:39:20.200 --> 03:39:23.560]  wow and he went in there is yeah oh yeah they're
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:27.240]  they're talking about taking blood and taking urine samples doing all these
[03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:30.440]  things that are now starting to happen and how this is going to be made
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:33.400]  you're going to have to have one of these real ideas to get a job to travel
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:37.000]  well now it's going to be to travel well they just sort of ease it in just like
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:40.520]  you know you're to get into my gym you have to use your thumb print so people
[03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:43.960]  just think it's normal they think it's normal and you know we just had the
[03:39:43.960 --> 03:39:47.560]  office of personal management had the millions of records stolen that was a
[03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:50.680]  central database yeah so you create this dmv
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:39:53.480]  central database and it's just asking to be hacked you're thinking it's going to
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:59.080]  cost 11 billion dollars over five years so that's where we're going and if
[03:39:59.080 --> 03:40:01.560]  people don't believe me that they're doing taking blood to get people's

[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:09.160]  you know my favorite story is the poor guy who's getting searched and

[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:38.920]  a stinker in austin today you know in texas if you want
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:42.920]  one of these well you have to give you thumbprints but k.i.s j carter shows you
[03:41:42.920 --> 03:41:47.000]  why some folks today said they don't want anybody scanning
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:51.080]  their body parts to go up and if they come up and touch me in any way i'm
[03:41:51.080 --> 03:41:53.880]  going to lay down peaceably and let the police state
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:58.840]  minions drag me away alex jones wants to renew his driver's license
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:04.440]  he also expects to be arrested i'm going in there with my passport
[03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:09.880]  my birth certificate my driver's license my w2 form but he won't give a
[03:42:09.880 --> 03:42:14.200]  thumbprint moments after this interview troopers did arrest him
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:18.360]  if i leave now i will be forced to register sir i'm here to get a driver's license i
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:21.640]  have never had a criminal record in this time again jones says fingerprinting
[03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:25.560]  gives government too much control and the next thing you know they'll ask for
[03:42:25.560 --> 03:42:29.160]  urine and blood samples uh for the what you were talking
[03:42:29.160 --> 03:42:33.480]  about the blood testing the drug screening is that really coming sir i
[03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:36.120]  have given you the federal documents that are
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:39.720]  mandating the states to do that clinton and 92 mandated the thumb scanning it
[03:42:39.720 --> 03:42:44.440]  has been adopted by many of the states texas since 93 he mandated it in late
[03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:49.240]  1997 for 98 to be implemented now that's up to the states and that's why we're
[03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:52.360]  drawing attention to this thumb scanning and no further i'm against
[03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:56.440]  thumb scanning but now they want this urine and blood testing this is the
[03:42:56.440 --> 03:42:58.840]  slippery slope and to those out there that say
[03:42:58.840 --> 03:43:03.880]  what do i have to hide i am innocent till proven guilty i have no criminal record
[03:43:03.880 --> 03:43:08.280]  alex jones has no criminal record and we should not be treated like criminals
[03:43:08.280 --> 03:43:11.800]  all right they're ready for me let's go come over and get the pretty little red
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:15.480]  light come on that pretty and they'll put a nice
[03:43:15.480 --> 03:43:18.040]  little clinic in here in the next few years for urine and blood testing like
[03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:20.920]  clinton wants what do i have to hide i'm a criminal
[03:43:20.920 --> 03:43:24.440]  there we have it nice little pretty red light get that
[03:43:26.120 --> 03:43:29.400]  there we have it your photograph they capture your signature
[03:43:29.400 --> 03:43:33.000]  they capture your thumb print and now clinton wants urine and blood
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:36.600]  and i've given that to the media the actual federal register that he wants
[03:43:36.600 --> 03:43:40.520]  the states to implement and i guess it tells them how to put clinics in and
[03:43:40.520 --> 03:43:43.560]  it tells them how to urine and blood test law abiding citizens
[03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:49.800]  not under 18 like the media says how you doing i am here with eight forms of
[03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:53.000]  identification i have my passport here is that my
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:56.600]  name and the form you asked me to fill out i have no criminal record my name is
[03:43:56.600 --> 03:44:00.520]  alexander emrick jones here is my passport
[03:44:00.520 --> 03:44:04.760]  here is my insurance here is another form of id

[03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:19.880]  need for you to answer these first three questions they can look at these
[03:44:19.880 --> 03:44:22.600]  questions there and go good things so i don't have to thumb scan
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:26.440]  well we're going to get to that you are eventually going to have to yes sir
[03:44:26.440 --> 03:44:31.000]  but not now not at this point but you will before we're done with the process
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:36.760]  why it's required by bill clinton in 1992 and it was instituted here in texas in
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:39.400]  1993 i know the code sir are you going to institute his
[03:44:39.400 --> 03:44:42.440]  urine and blood testing when he commands you are you going to stick a
[03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:44.520]  needle in my arm when i have no criminal record
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:47.640]  only answers i'm only questions i'm going to answer right now are concerning
[03:44:47.640 --> 03:44:51.320]  driver's license issuance you just follow orders don't you
[03:44:51.320 --> 03:44:55.720]  so you're saying you're going to deny me the constitutional right to travel
[03:44:55.720 --> 03:45:00.760]  if i do not submit to this digital thumb scanning
[03:45:00.760 --> 03:45:04.840]  what i will tell you today you will not receive a duplicate driver's license if you do not
[03:45:04.840 --> 03:45:08.280]  submit to a thumb print okay look i feel like i'm being raped here
[03:45:08.280 --> 03:45:11.720]  well i would sit down you for hours you try to do what i could
[03:45:11.720 --> 03:45:15.240]  then just give me my license without digitally thumb scanning i am not going
[03:45:15.240 --> 03:45:17.880]  to violate because is there a religious exception
[03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:22.280]  for your exception is there a religious exception
[03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:25.560]  everyone must take the mark a digitally
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:29.400]  enhanced mark i'm not talking about mark a digital tattoo
[03:45:29.400 --> 03:45:34.040]  i know your id you are good to go yeah well i'm good to go why do you need my
[03:45:34.040 --> 03:45:37.240]  thumb print it's part of bill
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:40.680]  it's part of bill clinton's law isn't it it's an executive order
[03:45:40.680 --> 03:45:46.520]  it's a decree by bill clinton ncic
[03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:49.320]  yeah and if i drive without a license what's what's the penalties for driving
[03:45:49.320 --> 03:45:51.480]  without a license you know i don't even want to go there
[03:45:51.480 --> 03:45:54.920]  that's right you know why i'm asking you doesn't pertain to it you're an officer
[03:45:54.920 --> 03:45:57.800]  i'm asking you the law i would be glad to sit down so you're
[03:45:57.800 --> 03:46:02.040]  saying i'll be committing a crime by driving if i don't take your mark
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:05.400]  this is against the grain of the constitution look
[03:46:05.400 --> 03:46:09.080]  if i don't take the mark my right to travel is taken
[03:46:09.080 --> 03:46:12.120]  you're taking my rights and telling me that it's no big deal
[03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:16.040]  and now you want a urine and blood test bring me the the uh the uh document
[03:46:16.040 --> 03:46:19.320]  who has the urine and blood testing document i need it i'm going to pass
[03:46:19.320 --> 03:46:23.160]  these out to people ladies and gentlemen the federal

[03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:30.360]  tell your friends about it we have got to stand against this
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:34.200]  the stats are preparing to implement this plan yeah right
[03:46:34.200 --> 03:46:37.400]  now i will be forced to arrest sir i'm here to get a driver's license i have
[03:46:37.400 --> 03:46:41.320]  never had a criminal record it it's time to go here i go get my stuff for me

[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:55.480]  so
[03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:03.880]  often at the patrol car and stop and terrorism aren't they
[03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:07.560]  i hope people were watching that on m4s.com forward slash show because
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:12.760]  you know that was vintage vintage vintage vintage alex johns like at his best
[03:47:12.760 --> 03:47:16.280]  with the documents trying to change the system right
[03:47:16.280 --> 03:47:20.120]  up against you know the giant dmv which you know and those guys there they were
[03:47:20.120 --> 03:47:23.000]  right they were just following orders they didn't even know the law they
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:25.160]  didn't they probably didn't even know about the
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:28.440]  the blood and urine samples coming down of course did you see how scared they
[03:47:28.440 --> 03:47:32.280]  looked they were like he is looking around and what's going on we don't know
[03:47:32.280 --> 03:47:35.400]  yeah we're just following orders sir we're just following orders that trooper
[03:47:35.400 --> 03:47:39.560]  who arrested funny enough we ran into him when we were opposing the tsa
[03:47:39.560 --> 03:47:43.240]  sort of the same thing we were going to to oppose the tsa there it is alex
[03:47:43.240 --> 03:47:46.840]  reunite with trooper who arrested him for a thumb scan refusal
[03:47:46.840 --> 03:47:49.640]  guys still working he's like you know what you a lot of things he said were
[03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:53.640]  right it came and happened it was really an amazing conversation
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:57.880]  running into that guy just we were storming the
[03:47:57.880 --> 03:48:03.080]  storming the capital essentially to get them to to uphold their ban on these
[03:48:03.080 --> 03:48:06.840]  naked body scanners and the tsa pat downs but you know
[03:48:06.840 --> 03:48:09.640]  which turned out they were like oh they're completely harmless and then of
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:12.920]  course they had to get rid of those because they weren't in fact completely
[03:48:12.920 --> 03:48:16.840]  harmless and so whenever i go through the tsa and i'm like i'm opting out
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:20.280]  and they always try to say oh it's not a microwave
[03:48:20.280 --> 03:48:24.120]  i'm like you know what you aren't a woman and i still would like to have
[03:48:24.120 --> 03:48:27.960]  children that aren't deformed you unzip your DNA exactly
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:32.040]  so where does this all go this the the the feds are getting your blood DNA in
[03:48:32.040 --> 03:48:35.320]  other ways anybody who has had kids at a hospital
[03:48:35.320 --> 03:48:39.800]  knows they come and prick the kids heal and then they put these blood spots they
[03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:42.120]  take these little spots and they put the blood on the
[03:48:42.120 --> 03:48:44.520]  heal on there and they send them off and they go
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:48.040]  hey we're going to do this to check for diseases right and we're going to check
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:52.440]  see if your kids got any chromosomal deficiencies and we'll let you know
[03:48:52.440 --> 03:48:56.200]  well i've had four children done this four times
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:48:59.720]  never come back with anything i haven't gotten one thing back but you know what
[03:48:59.720 --> 03:49:02.840]  they do do they keep this stuff and put it in a secret database and they weren't
[03:49:02.840 --> 03:49:05.560]  telling people that that's what it was for here's the texas
[03:49:05.560 --> 03:49:11.160]  tribune d8 dshs turned over hundreds of dna samples to the feds
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:14.440]  wow and uh that reveals the newborn screening program
[03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:18.120]  the transfer of hundreds of infant blood spots to an armed forces lab to build
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:24.920]  a national and someday international mitochondrial dna uh registry wow
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:28.760]  okay and they do that with every kid that's born yeah every little baby that's
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:32.440]  born they get your your dna and now they've been sued
[03:49:32.440 --> 03:49:35.160]  so now you fill out a card that says you want them destroyed
[03:49:35.160 --> 03:49:39.480]  right i know that knows if they really do it yeah how is there any way to tell
[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:42.680]  and that's exactly it they're wanting to create this database just like
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:46.360]  uh you have those other companies that tell people to send in their blood
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:49.640]  samples so we can tell you your your history your
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:52.920]  neurological history where do you come from it's so amazing maybe you were
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:56.520]  descended from a king or and when you sign something you probably sign away
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:00.280]  your rights to have that they you could send to them owning it and being able
[03:50:00.280 --> 03:50:03.560]  to use it well yeah that's i mean that's what themselves that's
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:06.520]  that's what came out you know just earlier this year and of course that
[03:50:06.520 --> 03:50:10.200]  23 in me is google's one of the google founder's
[03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:14.760]  wife owns that company so it's just you know i wouldn't
[03:50:14.760 --> 03:50:17.480]  willingly give up my bloods i mean i'd be interested to
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:21.240]  trace trace my genealogy but i got a personal story when i went to go get my
[03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:24.520]  license renewed this year i wasn't able to do it and i was
[03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:30.680]  oh why what's wrong well something from california back in 2009 apparently i
[03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:34.360]  got hit with a speeding camera back in 2009 never knew about it
[03:50:34.360 --> 03:50:38.680]  it's been sitting around in california who knows i had to track them down try to
[03:50:38.680 --> 03:50:41.640]  get through that you had to try to get through california dnv to get anything
[03:50:41.640 --> 03:50:45.080]  done crazy town and you know that everything's
[03:50:45.080 --> 03:50:48.280]  merging everything's merging so everything talks to each other
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:51.240]  and everything could be hacked as we shown yesterday we got hacked yesterday
[03:50:51.240 --> 03:50:55.080]  so it's crazy where we live we should all just go hide in our homes and put our
[03:50:55.080 --> 03:50:59.640]  little virtual reality headsets our play rock and roll till we're 70 right
[03:50:59.640 --> 03:51:05.080]  my name is don whiskin in 1994 i lost my 62 year old father to complications of
[03:51:05.080 --> 03:51:09.640]  bypass surgery in 1977 my 44 year old brother was found

[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:56.760]  travis our youtube guy collect these rants we have over 160

[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:14.920]  and see that or at least a a section of it yeah i think that was a really
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:17.800]  impressive interview we've been trying to get him back on for quite some time so
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:21.960]  it was exciting to get him on today uh do you have a favorite rant i i kind of
[03:56:21.960 --> 03:56:25.160]  like the one that's been making the rounds recently where jones is
[03:56:25.160 --> 03:56:28.680]  snacking in his face his face are being so bad at covering stories
[03:56:28.680 --> 03:56:31.640]  yeah i i can't choose one from this year like because
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:35.480]  i collect them so i'm just so inundated i can't really pick one
[03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:38.760]  my favorite alex jones rant of all time
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:42.360]  was the one uh he was sitting in the control room he had his old one
[03:56:42.360 --> 03:56:46.360]  he had his headphones on he was talking about you know cops and all this stuff
[03:56:46.360 --> 03:56:49.640]  all this crazy stuff and talking about cops going to the strip club and
[03:56:49.640 --> 03:56:52.760]  kids getting out autistic shots and all this stuff so that was probably my
[03:56:52.760 --> 03:56:55.400]  favorite one i think it's called like alex you can probably find on youtube
[03:56:55.400 --> 03:56:59.080]  it's like alex jones best rant ever yeah for those of you that don't know
