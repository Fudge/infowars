[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.000 --> 00:41.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.240 --> 00:47.640]  ladies and gentlemen coming up later in the broadcast this live Tuesday the
[00:47.640 --> 00:53.880]  17th of December 2013 edition Larry Klayman the legendary constitutional
[00:53.880 --> 00:59.160]  lawyer that's waged war on tyrants everywhere he is going to be joining us
[00:59.160 --> 01:06.160]  he got the big ruling yesterday by a judge that the NSA is clearly violating
[01:06.160 --> 01:09.920]  the Constitution he said from his research and perspective it appeared
[01:09.920 --> 01:16.400]  they were and ruled in claimants favor but obviously the higher court will say
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.600]  oh no a unreasonable search spying on everything you do and stealing your data
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.440]  with no probable cause that is reasonable so judge deals blow to NSA
[01:27.440 --> 01:31.960]  phone data program and we're going to be obviously going over that ruling that
[01:31.960 --> 01:35.960]  broke yesterday during the third hour and we've got Larry Klayman coming up
[01:35.960 --> 01:43.320]  William F. Jasper the editor and chief over at the New American magazine is
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.240]  going to be looking at these global partnerships that are bigger and more
[01:47.240 --> 01:53.480]  dangerous in his view and I agree with him that even Obamacare so that huge
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.880]  tyrannical power grab that even the Huffington Post calls a tyrannical
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.360]  authoritarian transference of power where foreign corporations will have more
[02:02.360 --> 02:08.320]  authority than the Congress on trade this is what globalism is global bodies
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.520]  with traders and government and the executive that transfer your sovereignty
[02:12.520 --> 02:16.240]  we're being conquered we're being usurped that's how the heavy players
[02:16.240 --> 02:19.760]  have always operated at the top historically somehow they taught the
[02:19.760 --> 02:23.560]  public that oh government trying to power grab or outside groups trying to
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.040]  take over that doesn't exist that's never happened in history even though
[02:28.040 --> 02:31.880]  that's all that happened in history and never mind the 20th century or the 21st
[02:31.880 --> 02:37.280]  century just ignore it all so that's coming up as well today here on the
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.440]  broadcast and we'll have open phones and we've got the station manager 1530 a.m.
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.080]  up in Chicago popping in for about 20 minutes to give us his take on life under
[02:48.080 --> 02:55.800]  the dawn under the mayor Rom Emanuel whose brother you know admits they're
[02:55.800 --> 03:01.520]  trying to wreck the health care system publicly he is going to be coming on the
[03:01.520 --> 03:06.840]  transmission with us to give us his take on all things Chicago land which is a
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.840]  great city in many respects but it's a big problem is being absolutely
[03:10.840 --> 03:17.360]  infested by the New World Order so he's going to be popping in and joining us
[03:17.360 --> 03:21.680]  coming up and of course as I said open phones and I'll open the phones up again
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.680]  today but I think it's going to be on specific topics because I really want
[03:27.680 --> 03:30.320]  to get your take on some of these issues we're going to be breaking down after
[03:30.320 --> 03:38.040]  the break now where to begin when we come back there is so much to cover here so
[03:38.040 --> 03:44.400]  much to go over here how about corporate socialism general motors says no way it
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.360]  will pay back 10 billion bailout money it used to move to China and Brazil you
[03:49.360 --> 03:52.640]  don't just pay to bail it out you pay to have it leave the country only in
[03:52.640 --> 03:56.520]  America and if you don't like it you're a conspiracy theorist and a racist
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.520]  Obama is meeting with tech giants over surveillance Obamacare we're going to
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.280]  break that down multivitamin researchers say cases closed after studies find no
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.440]  health benefits we're going to break down this giant hoax we also have other
[04:10.440 --> 04:15.480]  similar government sponsored studies and incorporate a big pharma sponsored
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.400]  studies where they say mercury is good for your children's brains so remember
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.800]  that we're going to break down I instantly knew the fraud in this and
[04:24.800 --> 04:27.840]  looked it up we're going to break that fraud down Anthony Gutiard is going to
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.840]  be popping in but I'm going to get to that right after the break we'll also get
[04:31.840 --> 04:37.080]  into Pennsylvania is now under federal guidelines co coercing people into
[04:37.080 --> 04:41.280]  giving cheek swabs at checkpoints that you know that's happening in Texas
[04:41.280 --> 04:45.560]  Florida Georgia California but in this case the people are told you're going
[04:45.560 --> 04:51.800]  to give it Mac so that's coming up and neighbors call cops on man for watering
[04:51.800 --> 04:56.760]  car in his own driveway that's part of it into 21 the rest of the story when we
[04:56.760 --> 05:04.480]  come back straight ahead in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.880]  staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in
[05:09.880 --> 05:14.360]  nations around the world guess what else is in a halogen family fluoride
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.000]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.800]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[05:23.800 --> 05:29.120]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[05:29.120 --> 05:34.120]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[05:34.120 --> 05:40.200]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent

[08:45.840 --> 08:52.040]  central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance
[09:04.040 --> 09:10.200]  well ladies and gentlemen even mainstream media is calling it the rise of
[09:10.200 --> 09:18.040]  Google's robot army the rise of the machines Google search and destroy rise
[09:18.040 --> 09:23.080]  of the robot animals as they've now bought four in the last week and now
[09:23.080 --> 09:28.920]  four more so eight robot companies in the last week as Google makes the
[09:28.920 --> 09:36.360]  executive decision to literally buy up almost all serious humanoid or animal
[09:36.360 --> 09:45.120]  type combat capable in the future robot systems and we told you that was coming
[09:45.120 --> 09:48.480]  the French Socialists have announced they're going to phase out humans in
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.320]  factories and the government's going to direct tax incentives to move to robots
[09:52.320 --> 09:58.320]  the Chinese at Foxconn factories building the Apple products with with the
[09:58.320 --> 10:04.520]  lowest pay in the nation on average for industrial workers factory workers with
[10:04.520 --> 10:09.840]  forced abortions forced drugging 18-hour workdays suicide nets beyond a
[10:09.840 --> 10:21.600]  dystopic novel beyond 1984 ladies and gentlemen they are racing to replace
[10:21.600 --> 10:28.080]  humans and make us obsolete using our tax money and our energy to build the
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.120]  structure to remove us from the equation they are consciously making the
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.480]  decision to corner the market to shut down farming and ranching to make us
[10:36.480 --> 10:50.920]  dependent as a tool of absolute siege and control and they are racing racing to
[10:50.920 --> 10:56.200]  try to entertain and dumb down the general population so that they think
[10:56.200 --> 11:02.000]  it's cool and acceptable and so they go along with it and now at Foxconn
[11:02.000 --> 11:10.120]  in China they are replacing the humans factory by factory last time I checked
[11:10.120 --> 11:14.200]  there's 15 million robots on order 5 million got delivered earlier this
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.680]  year and they are replacing the humans with the robots and I don't mean
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.040]  programmed welding robots that weld a certain design of car or vehicle I mean
[11:24.040 --> 11:30.280]  robots that replace humans to then ship the iPads the iPhones the children's
[11:30.280 --> 11:38.600]  toys the melamine covered cutlery the pharmaceuticals all of it to then be
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.360]  shipped to the US where we ourselves are being deindustrialized where we
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.680]  ourselves are being removed from jobs being given welfare to live in
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.320]  government finance hovels they're actually owned by private interest and
[11:52.320 --> 11:59.760]  administered by JP Morgan Chase towards the final equation total social
[11:59.760 --> 12:07.320]  engineering control under agenda 21 and in the release of superbugs both manmade
[12:07.320 --> 12:12.480]  and also allowed to develop to wipe out large portions of the population and on
[12:12.480 --> 12:18.160]  every front there are thousands of points every single day out there in
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.840]  front of everyone that show where this is happening how everything is done to
[12:22.840 --> 12:26.720]  shut us down everything is done to shut down our industry and only allows
[12:26.720 --> 12:34.640]  select corporate fortune 500 and fortune 100 and fortune 20 allied connected
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.840]  interlocking corporations to operate they are totally exempt from regulations
[12:39.840 --> 12:45.240]  and taxes on almost every front they write the regulations they implement the
[12:45.240 --> 12:51.000]  system and it is designed in an economic takeover program to absolutely leave you
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.040]  destitute and when they're done they'll change the actuaries when they're done
[12:56.040 --> 12:58.960]  bankrupting poor people moving on the middle-class mail then they're going to
[12:58.960 --> 13:02.360]  bankrupt the nouveau riche the independent wealthy and then they're
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.160]  going to dial up taxes and regulations to bankrupt that next group there is no
[13:07.160 --> 13:14.600]  way mathematically to escape them unless you take them out politically there is
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.360]  no way to beat their supercomputers there is no way to beat their surveillance
[13:18.360 --> 13:24.280]  system there's no way to beat their dark geniuses with their dark logic there is
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.560]  no way to beat them but having a break with them and literally at a spiritual
[13:29.560 --> 13:40.680]  physical financial level declaring them from a trumpet to be our enemies you
[13:40.680 --> 13:45.960]  either admit it or you subcom to it let me give you the next report this is just
[13:45.960 --> 13:50.160]  one out of over a hundred to fifty articles all that point at the same thing
[13:50.160 --> 14:00.680]  look at this this is a report put out by CNBC should GM repay 10 billion rescue
[14:00.680 --> 14:09.040]  costs CEO says no here's Curt Nemo's article upon info wars.com corporate
[14:09.040 --> 14:15.360]  socialism GM says no way it will pay back 10 billion but wait it gets better
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.600]  they're not just shutting down now upwards of 500 coal power plants and
[14:20.600 --> 14:23.400]  thousands more they're gonna shut down they're totally clean but aren't owned
[14:23.400 --> 14:26.920]  by the globalist general electric tax exempt total regulation waivers they
[14:26.920 --> 14:32.160]  can pump out any amount of toxic waste out of coal power plants they want not
[14:32.160 --> 14:35.280]  only is our competition shut down they can run dirty and build plants in
[14:35.280 --> 14:38.840]  Mexico when they shut down the Texas plant supplying five states and ship it
[14:38.840 --> 14:45.280]  and that's just one example of literal Godzilla level attack if you had the
[14:45.280 --> 14:49.520]  hypothetical Godzilla come out in the tax San Francisco or Tokyo it could not
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.200]  do as much damage as they do in one month to our infrastructure that was the
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.560]  giant jewel of the world they are literally image it just swinging their
[14:59.560 --> 15:04.000]  tails and firing their heat rays right into everything we've got the country is
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.840]  blowing up and melting down in front of us they shut down over 500 plants of new
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.120]  design hundreds of other old plants they're buying up city plants county
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.280]  plants stayed on plants they're shutting them down power prices are redlining
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.120]  people are going bankrupt we're getting hit hard by a military attack it gets
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.480]  worse the 20 plus billion it's actually 22 billion last time I checked this is a
[15:30.480 --> 15:35.680]  10 billion payment that's come to by General Motors do you know what they
[15:35.680 --> 15:42.600]  spent almost all the money on they spent it on shipping General Motors to China
[15:42.600 --> 15:48.760]  Brazil and Eastern Europe I'm gonna say that again look it up Curtin M. O's got
[15:48.760 --> 15:56.720]  it in his article they shipped your jobs you paid tax money to ship your jobs
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.960]  they don't just ship your jobs overseas boys and girls you paid for it and you
[16:02.960 --> 16:06.600]  know why because the average person doesn't know how politics or geopolitics
[16:06.600 --> 16:13.480]  works it's literally like a green beret fighting a three-year-old boy that's
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.200]  what it's like when these scientific technocrats with the greatest minds in
[16:17.200 --> 16:20.960]  the world attack and the public won't admit they're under attack it is like a
[16:20.960 --> 16:29.320]  three-year-old boy fighting a top green beret or navy seal and listen you could
[16:29.320 --> 16:33.560]  grow up and be an adult and get ready for what's happening but you won't do it
[16:33.560 --> 16:38.360]  you stay in a childlike arrested development three-year-old level I'm
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.280]  talking to new listeners saying this isn't happening oh it's happening while
[16:42.280 --> 16:48.120]  you're busy watching the NFL while you're busy into your favorite music star
[16:48.120 --> 16:53.880]  well well you're busy watching your favorite sitcom we're under total siege
[16:53.880 --> 16:57.200]  because the globalists are taking the planet over towards their goal to then
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.880]  bring in planetary rule to then drop the hammer they can't do it till planetary
[17:01.880 --> 17:05.320]  rules in because the nuclear war might happen if they release these bio weapons
[17:05.320 --> 17:09.360]  they've done the war games they know it's gonna result in nuclear war and they
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.880]  don't probably want that so they've got to get the police state in place first
[17:13.880 --> 17:18.480]  and a global standardization before they do this and the minute they get a real
[17:18.480 --> 17:22.400]  world government in they're gonna up the taxes bankrupt everybody ten times
[17:22.400 --> 17:26.680]  worse and then they're gonna drop the hammer and listen folks how much have
[17:26.680 --> 17:30.160]  you seen me talk about over the years it's already come through their band
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.800]  lemonade stands nationwide they're arresting people are threatening to
[17:33.800 --> 17:37.920]  arrest them that wash their car in their own yard they're taking blood and other
[17:37.920 --> 17:42.640]  samples at checkpoints without warrants I've got more news today we're under the
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.560]  beginnings of real martial law let me tell you when the TSA is playing ping
[17:47.560 --> 17:51.800]  pong with your wave-os you're in tyranny let me tell you when the IRS goes to
[17:51.800 --> 17:54.560]  Congress it says don't people leave the country if we say we have a tax
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.960]  investigation you're in a police state when the NSA spies and everything you
[17:58.960 --> 18:02.520]  do illegally and gets away with it you're in a police state every day I see
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.720]  where police go to the wrong house and shoot someone and don't even get in
[18:07.720 --> 18:13.120]  trouble I've got two reports today in the stack of that and Anthony Gucci
[18:13.120 --> 18:17.920]  already last night woke up to tanks armored vehicles you name it at the
[18:17.920 --> 18:23.520]  wrong house and big giant fat goblin commander cop with a SWAT team literally
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.640]  dragging some woman out who was innocent was a wrong house and a fake drug
[18:27.640 --> 18:31.920]  war where they ship all the drugs in to begin with so that they can then have an
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.880]  excuse to set up a tyranny this is the reality and see how shut down your jobs
[18:36.880 --> 18:41.600]  ship them to the slave camps in China it's okay because Al Gore owns part of
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.200]  Apple so have suicide nets it's trendy if you're against suicide nets you're
[18:45.200 --> 18:51.040]  racist shut down the power plant shut down everything and then this this piece
[18:51.040 --> 18:55.360]  of news here it is Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's coercing to giving
[18:55.360 --> 19:01.120]  cheek swabs at checkpoints that's the kind of news we have here neighbors call
[19:01.120 --> 19:05.360]  cops on man for washing car in his own driveway this is happening everywhere
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.760]  it's always in a 21 and then when we come back I'm gonna break this down I
[19:09.760 --> 19:15.120]  told you this was coming they cannot have you supplementing with even things
[19:15.120 --> 19:18.760]  like vitamin C in Europe under Codex Alimentarius I've watched the UN
[19:18.760 --> 19:23.600]  meetings they've made it where it's basically a hundred euros to get a
[19:23.600 --> 19:28.160]  bottle of vitamin C that would actually do any good for you and now they're
[19:28.160 --> 19:32.880]  bringing in GMO and pesticide fed oranges where you can't even get the
[19:32.880 --> 19:36.560]  nutrients you need and now they have a big hoax nation right on every news

[24:59.600 --> 25:10.000]  right folks we are back live on this Tuesday edition it is the 15th day 17th
[25:10.000 --> 25:19.120]  day of December 2013 and coming up in the next segment I am going to detail
[25:19.120 --> 25:28.480]  all of the facts here on earth and here on this planet dealing with our soils
[25:29.560 --> 25:35.280]  because when you see a story out there I knew yesterday when I saw this on the
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.640]  news at about three o'clock what they would put in a study and then I looked
[25:39.640 --> 25:47.120]  at it last night and then I looked at it again this morning and as soon as I
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.120]  read their statements I knew what they were going to say because it's a play
[25:51.120 --> 25:55.520]  book put out by Big Pharma and I've debated Dr. Dina Dell who pushes this
[25:55.520 --> 25:59.800]  I've debated others over the years I challenge them to debate now they will
[25:59.800 --> 26:06.080]  not come on because they know I will clean their clock in about 60 seconds
[26:06.080 --> 26:11.440]  before the show I told the guys to print just a couple articles that I'm gonna
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.280]  show you now and then the next segment I'm gonna go into in detail with a
[26:16.280 --> 26:23.240]  report for you here is the article out of CBS news one of literally thousands
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.960]  right now in every media outlet pushing the hoax multivitamin researchers say
[26:28.960 --> 26:37.320]  cases closed after studies find no health benefits and what did I highlight
[26:37.320 --> 26:45.840]  right there we believe notice they said we believe that the case is closed you
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.520]  also believe that leprechauns are real probably we believe that the case is
[26:49.520 --> 26:55.440]  closed and he went he goes on to add supplementing the diet of well nourished
[26:55.440 --> 27:04.560]  adults with the most mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit listen
[27:04.560 --> 27:10.120]  all these provides us and might even be harmful now we're gonna break down the
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.480]  fraud when we come back but let me explain something here this is pre
[27:14.480 --> 27:17.880]  meditative see I've dealt with this for so long I know what they say and what
[27:17.880 --> 27:24.240]  they do if you go on and do research you learn that the FDA has continued to
[27:24.240 --> 27:30.480]  lower the minimum daily allowance of what they say you need a vitamin C vitamin
[27:30.480 --> 27:37.520]  D vitamin E vitamin K I'm gonna get Dr. Mercola on about this later this week if
[27:37.520 --> 27:44.640]  you can get him on or Dr. Blalock all these medical doctors I get nutritionist
[27:44.640 --> 27:51.000]  on all day long they have lowered the level of vitamin C down to near scurvy
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.480]  inducing levels where you start having rottles in your skin and your skin
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.080]  basically falls apart and you prematurely age how many people do you see who you
[27:58.080 --> 28:01.640]  talk to a 50 year old woman looks like they're a hundred you go let me guess
[28:01.640 --> 28:07.040]  you read fruits and vegetables no I don't I eat it McDonald's I mean that's
[28:07.040 --> 28:11.640]  why they literally I'll have rottles in their arms they have scurvy I've talked
[28:11.640 --> 28:15.760]  to the nutritionist they get on vitamin C in a month it's the the holes in their
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.720]  arms are all healed we've had medical doctors tell people that we know like
[28:20.720 --> 28:25.880]  Ted Anderson's dad get off vitamin C and then his Alzheimer's and scurvy comes
[28:25.880 --> 28:30.360]  back of course is your brain shuts down with no vitamin C they knew this 400
[28:30.360 --> 28:34.600]  years ago in England so they called British sailors limies because they
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.000]  carry big bags of key lines with them and nobody else did and when a British
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.040]  ship pulled up one of their best-kept secrets when a British ship pulled up
[28:42.040 --> 28:46.320]  they had all had vitamin C and the people they were fighting had and and
[28:46.320 --> 28:50.560]  well it was Spanish or Portuguese or French or whoever around the world they
[28:50.560 --> 28:54.360]  couldn't even lift a sword to fight them and of course the British sailors didn't
[28:54.360 --> 28:58.680]  like the taste of it either so they put it in their rum one part rum two parts
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.800]  water their their grog as it was called to make them drink it so yeah you don't
[29:04.800 --> 29:10.360]  need more limes more vitamin C if you're getting a good dose of it but the
[29:10.360 --> 29:14.440]  problem is they've lowered it down to nothing I'm gonna break it all down and
[29:14.440 --> 29:17.840]  recap it because I got so mad during the break I hardly talk when I came in I
[29:17.840 --> 29:24.680]  was bumbling around I'm gonna come back in a focused laser beam fashion and
[29:24.680 --> 29:28.440]  break down this hoax for you now obviously they want to ship your jobs
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.800]  to China they want to shut down your power plants they want to break down the
[29:32.800 --> 29:36.120]  family they want to say two plus two equals five to kids they want to say
[29:36.120 --> 29:40.320]  parents aren't parents anymore everything they do is meant to debilitate you so
[29:40.320 --> 29:46.080]  they can dominate now they say you don't need vitamins and minerals and we have
[29:46.080 --> 29:49.200]  the clip where they say mercury is good for children's brains they are lying
[29:49.200 --> 29:56.720]  scum we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[30:11.800 --> 30:15.640]  huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat they
[30:15.640 --> 30:19.720]  know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come

[30:24.080 --> 30:28.560]  relocation and the securing of your home what I tell people is that you do have

[30:32.520 --> 30:36.520]  pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in every one of
[30:36.520 --> 30:39.800]  these states most people wouldn't be ready won't be able to get out of town
[30:39.800 --> 30:44.840]  because they'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness without strategy this

[33:23.040 --> 33:30.880]  the heart of the resistance it's Alex Jones. I remember two years ago they
[33:30.880 --> 33:36.120]  had national news stories literally thousands of newspapers carrying the
[33:36.120 --> 33:42.040]  articles debunking the fact that there was a plan to roll out drones to
[33:42.040 --> 33:46.240]  surveil the American people and they said that we were liars and that it
[33:46.240 --> 33:49.520]  wasn't real and that's because they didn't want a national movement
[33:49.520 --> 33:55.000]  forming against surveillance drones before they rolled out officially we of
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.320]  course were covering the FAA preparing to authorize 30,000 drones in the sky by
[34:00.320 --> 34:07.040]  2020 10,000 or more drones by 2015 we were just covering a government policy and
[34:07.040 --> 34:11.520]  that they were already using them for surveillance and showing examples and so
[34:11.520 --> 34:16.440]  they came out and said it did not exist now two years later they admit it's been
[34:16.440 --> 34:20.360]  going on and they're throwing in your face just like they said they didn't buy
[34:20.360 --> 34:25.560]  1.6 billion bullets now 2.2 billion now 2.5 billion now they suddenly admit oh
[34:25.560 --> 34:29.960]  we did do that and we are buying armored vehicles from the army and we are
[34:29.960 --> 34:34.160]  deploying them against you and oh we are spying on you with NSA and oh we are
[34:34.160 --> 34:38.520]  funding al-qaeda overseas and oh we are shipping general motors to China with
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.200]  your tax money and we are getting ready to take your private bank accounts and
[34:43.200 --> 34:46.760]  take your public and private pension funds and we are devaluing the dollar and
[34:46.760 --> 34:52.360]  the Federal Reserve is private that's because Congress has a six percent
[34:52.360 --> 34:57.160]  approval rating and they know the lies aren't working anymore so in a lot of
[34:57.160 --> 34:59.920]  areas they admit what they're doing would try to hide it in plain view and
[34:59.920 --> 35:04.880]  act like it's no big deal it'd be like someone passing gas on you with
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.000]  particularly nauseous odor and telling you that oh do you like the new air
[35:09.000 --> 35:14.440]  freshener that's what they're doing ladies and gentlemen now yesterday they
[35:14.440 --> 35:22.120]  roll out with a huge PR blitz that vitamins and minerals do nothing and
[35:22.120 --> 35:31.560]  basically the case is closed and on CNN CBS ABC Fox MSNBC everything my local
[35:31.560 --> 35:38.280]  paper has it in there national papers just everywhere chase closed you don't
[35:38.280 --> 35:43.560]  need any vitamins any minerals any supplements because big pharma is mad and
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.240]  is already basically banned them in Europe or you've got to pay upwards of a
[35:47.240 --> 35:50.960]  hundred dollars to get vitamin C in the same strength here they've lowered the
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.920]  daily allowance of what you need the government says of things like vitamin
[35:55.920 --> 36:02.760]  C and things like oil of oregano down to a level that literally is at
[36:02.760 --> 36:06.720]  starvation according to medical doctors we've interviewed here and they keep
[36:06.720 --> 36:11.400]  lowering them and lowering them and lowering them and dumping the deadly
[36:11.400 --> 36:15.920]  halogen fluoride into the water that is bug poison now before I get to this
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.880]  article I want to show you McCormick salt you can buy at any grocery store in
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.480]  the country and if you're watching on TV you can look at this or just go to the
[36:24.480 --> 36:27.920]  local supermarket and go look at any major salt that isn't naturally
[36:27.920 --> 36:31.560]  occurring the natural ones have good iodine other trace minerals and elements
[36:31.560 --> 36:37.440]  of them it says this salt does not supply iodine unnecessary nutrients says it
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.360]  right and why is that because the feds pressured him in the 20s to put iodine
[36:42.360 --> 36:47.640]  in the salt because of literally millions of people being born mentally
[36:47.640 --> 36:51.480]  retarded from not having iodine in the womb which is on record will cause all
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.480]  sorts of problems and lower IQs after birth and goiter that's people that look
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.120]  like their job of the hut with just huge things hanging under their necks where
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.760]  you look like a human worm Africa's devastated by this China's devastated by
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.960]  China in many areas puts iodine in the water so this doesn't happen because it's
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.720]  just a plague of diseases and degenerative problems now that's a fact
[37:15.720 --> 37:21.600]  the feds by the 70s basically said remove it or we'll come after you remove
[37:21.600 --> 37:26.240]  iodine out of the salt isn't that loving of them because this is the good
[37:26.240 --> 37:32.880]  halogen now that said they have to tell you I guess McCormick cares and wants
[37:32.880 --> 37:37.600]  to say hey by the way we don't have something you really need in here used
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.160]  to be putting the bread now they put bromine in there totally deadly all the
[37:41.160 --> 37:44.520]  bad halogens are pushing if you can't are mentally retarded you don't need
[37:44.520 --> 37:49.160]  them they're bad for you the good ones are removed across the board now let's
[37:49.160 --> 37:54.360]  move to the big announcement multivitamin researchers say cases closed
[37:54.360 --> 37:59.960]  after studies find no health benefits the message from doctors behind three new
[37:59.960 --> 38:06.920]  studies and an editorial notice that all came out together that tacked an
[38:06.920 --> 38:11.960]  off-debated question in medicine do daily multivitamins make you healthier
[38:11.960 --> 38:16.520]  after reviewing the available evidence and conducting new trials the authors
[38:16.520 --> 38:22.520]  have come to a conclusion of no we believe the case is closed supplementing
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.120]  the diet of well-nourished adults with most this keyword mineral and vitamin
[38:27.120 --> 38:32.320]  supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful so see that's the
[38:32.320 --> 38:35.480]  same line that dr. Dina Dell who I've debated puts out but then I would have
[38:35.480 --> 38:41.760]  him on I'd go doctor medical doctor what if you're not getting enough of the
[38:41.760 --> 38:45.800]  trace elements and minerals and vitamins you need all venue dunia I went oh and
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.480]  how many diseases and disorders in the womb and after our link to nutrition
[38:50.480 --> 38:53.240]  well a lot of them but we don't really look at that that's right medical
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.960]  doctors don't deal with that now if you come in with your skin rotting off and
[38:56.960 --> 39:00.400]  holes all over your body they don't say oh my god that's scurvy you need more
[39:00.400 --> 39:05.440]  vitamin C and they're like I don't eat no vegetables or I don't like them they
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.840]  don't tell you that they just saw your arm off that's what they do the worst
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.400]  nutrition in major studies is in hospitals now let's shift gears before I
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.760]  go any further let's play a clip from the journal of pediatrics the big
[39:20.760 --> 39:24.920]  prestigious journal of pediatrics they put out two new studies eight years ago
[39:24.920 --> 39:29.520]  on the same day and the same way it rolled out saying guess what mercury is
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.600]  actually good for you and again we're gonna put it on screen the journal of
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.800]  pediatrics for folks so they can go to the website and see what it is and
[39:37.800 --> 39:47.800]  actually read these studies where they said that mercury is good for your
[39:47.800 --> 39:55.680]  brain now let's go ahead and go to this clip that aired not just on CBS but
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.560]  nationwide at the time saying mercury is good for you folks mercury is the most
[39:59.560 --> 40:03.920]  destructive chemical the most destructive metal in the brain electro
[40:03.920 --> 40:08.520]  chemically it's incredible here's the clip mercury containing vaccines may
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.320]  help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.160]  have been lots by concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might
[40:17.160 --> 40:21.520]  impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.000]  the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.800]  behavior and mental performance okay so there you go they have these studies
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.720]  that mercury is good for your child's brain ladies and gentlemen now and for
[40:33.720 --> 40:37.840]  them being brain damage and slobbering and doing whatever you're told that is
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.160]  improved mental performance because they teach in public schools two plus two
[40:42.160 --> 40:47.640]  equals five worldwide the literal benchmark of 1984 is if you can say two
[40:47.640 --> 40:52.640]  plus two equals four you are free that seemed like satire at the time now
[40:52.640 --> 40:58.120]  understand he was a deep globalist on record Eric Blair was aka George Arwell
[40:58.120 --> 41:04.600]  and it just hits me of the magnitude of this that they teach two plus two equals
[41:04.600 --> 41:07.960]  five and they put brain damaging fluoride in the water mercury in the
[41:07.960 --> 41:11.320]  vaccines and tell you it's good for you even though the Harvard study says
[41:11.320 --> 41:14.480]  lowers IQ so let me show you some of the articles let me show you the facts
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.840]  number one dirt poor this is the scientific American because you get
[41:19.840 --> 41:23.440]  some good studies out there dirt poor have fruits and vegetables become less
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.640]  nutritious and they go on to break down major studies going back in the last
[41:27.640 --> 41:31.760]  hundred years from the University of Texas at Austin Department of Chemistry
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.200]  and biochemistry in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition and
[41:36.200 --> 41:42.560]  Agriculture nutritional data from 1950 to 1999 with 43 different fruits and
[41:42.560 --> 41:46.160]  vegetables and they're looking at studies before that and what is in them
[41:46.160 --> 41:53.160]  metrically by numbers real studies they are debilitated in some cases by 98
[41:53.160 --> 42:00.240]  percent vitamins minerals trace elements and then they give them a three
[42:00.480 --> 42:05.760]  nutrient based system for the plants in the fertilizers when there really needs
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.880]  to be more than 80 in there 90 is the mighty 90 is what a lot of the doctors
[42:11.880 --> 42:15.680]  break down so you're getting three things out of a plan when you need 90 I'm
[42:15.680 --> 42:23.920]  gonna say that again you're getting three things out of a plant when you need 90
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.960]  but mainline medical science says you need 60 something okay so so let's go
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.960]  over this now that's scientific American so they're saying oh if you've got a
[42:32.960 --> 42:37.360]  nutritious diet you don't need anything an absolute right if you're eating a
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.160]  really diverse thing in the jungle of say Brazil or something and had all these
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.520]  wide spectrum fruits vegetables plants animals you name it you and fish you
[42:45.520 --> 42:49.080]  would not need vitamins and minerals and absolutely fresh is the way to get
[42:49.080 --> 42:54.680]  things absolutely now let's move on the next one here's another one 1936 U.S.
[42:54.680 --> 43:00.040]  Senate report soil depleted 99% of Americans nutrient deficient that's a
[43:00.040 --> 43:04.120]  1936 U.S. Senate report and they recommended putting vitamins and
[43:04.120 --> 43:09.520]  minerals compulsorily in bread and in salt because of the brain damaging of
[43:09.520 --> 43:12.640]  the American people the reason people aren't as smart as they used to be folks
[43:12.640 --> 43:17.280]  physically is we're brain damaged from this okay and they don't want you now in
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.400]  the back of it the government said put this in salt give them vitamins minerals
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.680]  weird and then the globalists got control by the 40s and 50s they took it all
[43:24.680 --> 43:28.680]  out folks okay and now they're telling you don't go out and get it on your own
[43:28.680 --> 43:34.600]  because if you get it on your own that's it for them now let's continue here Mike
[43:34.600 --> 43:38.800]  Adams is a great report from natural news.com upon info wars.com MSM attacks
[43:38.800 --> 43:42.120]  multivitamins get another example of quack science he breaks down a bunch of
[43:42.120 --> 43:46.200]  other angles I haven't even gotten to here's another one. Glaxo says it will
[43:46.200 --> 43:54.240]  stop paying doctors to promote drugs they do that every year they pay medical
[43:54.240 --> 43:57.560]  doctors across the board to push drugs and not nutrition they even get rid of
[43:57.560 --> 44:01.320]  surgery now when you might need it and just saying drugs now let's continue
[44:01.320 --> 44:06.280]  here oh financial times exercise to tackle bad posture can avert back surgery
[44:06.280 --> 44:11.120]  but the hospitals won't tell you there's exercises that would cost you nothing to
[44:11.120 --> 44:16.220]  not have to have the surgery for the disc about to be fused or herniated they
[44:16.220 --> 44:22.000]  won't tell you because they want the surgery same deal oh here's another one
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.280]  how adding iodine to salt resulted in a decades worth of IQ gains for the United
[44:26.280 --> 44:32.760]  States links to the major university studies dealing with it okay so I've
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.600]  gone over some of that for you Anthony Gutiarty is coming in now just to cover
[44:36.600 --> 44:41.360]  a few of the angles and obviously I promote and sell vitamins and minerals
[44:41.360 --> 44:47.400]  I've used that I believe in that have done wonders in my life and everybody
[44:47.400 --> 44:49.960]  that's used them you've heard the calls not one negative call on our
[44:49.960 --> 44:54.240]  proprietary nasa and iodine it's blowing people away of course it is the coffee
[44:54.240 --> 44:59.000]  Chiapas my favorite coffee people are going wow this is really incredibly good
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.880]  coffee at a low price I'll shoot in bs's yeah I'm not gonna if I was a wine
[45:02.880 --> 45:06.640]  producer which is really hard to do obviously say I lived in Northern California
[45:06.640 --> 45:09.680]  and Sonoma County or something some of the best wine in the country I think is
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.280]  good as French wine I wouldn't put wine out unless it was really good I'd throw
[45:13.280 --> 45:18.520]  it away same deal I'm gonna promote what I use what I think bomb shell and
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.320]  that's how we fund ourselves not taxpayer funded or government protected
[45:23.320 --> 45:29.680]  like Big Pharma or MPR or MSNBC but the point here is folks it's a fact that
[45:29.680 --> 45:33.000]  you can't get the nutrients you need from almost all the food on the store
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.480]  shelves it's a fact that it's been life-changing for me taking high-density
[45:37.480 --> 45:41.760]  minerals and vitamins and then the iodine was just the turbocharger and I
[45:41.760 --> 45:45.720]  told you don't buy our iodine get the gourmet sea salts Himalayan's double
[45:45.720 --> 45:49.600]  check make sure they have the iodine in it it's not unbound but it's better than
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.600]  nothing it'll do wonders for you bottom line they don't want you knowing this
[45:55.600 --> 46:00.160]  folks they don't want you understanding this why people are zombies Anthony
[46:00.160 --> 46:03.760]  Gutiarty this has really gotten me angry they say mercury's good for kids
[46:03.760 --> 46:08.920]  brains and then now they say we don't need vitamins or minerals but notice if
[46:08.920 --> 46:14.480]  we don't have malnutrition we don't need it well no what Sherlock no kidding
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.520]  obviously if you had a perfect diet you wouldn't need this but the diet we have
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.760]  is crap so they're playing a semantical mind game and they use synthetic
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.880]  garbage stuff in the study that's the key this goes beyond a hoax this meta
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.720]  analysis in these studies are beyond hoax 100% deceptive in fact I'm going to
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.760]  prove on air right now how they actually demonstrate everything that we're saying
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.160]  is right and that GMO's are bad synthetics are bad and that overall an
[46:42.160 --> 46:47.160]  organic approach is the best and the only way now specifically to make to
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.840]  understand this around this time every year they attack supplements and specifically
[46:52.840 --> 46:55.680]  vitamins and they also attack because the New Year's coming up they don't want
[46:55.680 --> 46:58.600]  the it to keep growing people getting healthy and learning how to fly back the
[46:58.600 --> 47:02.000]  organic food industry and the supplement industry the natural products
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.920]  industry are the only two things right now that are really going up and Big
[47:04.920 --> 47:08.560]  Farm absolutely hates this I wrote an article and only part of American
[47:08.560 --> 47:12.320]  economy left yes exactly it's actually a lot of it's made the United States
[47:12.320 --> 47:16.120]  almost all of it 99% besides the Chinese crap ones which are the ones they're
[47:16.120 --> 47:20.840]  studying is coincidentally now in 2011 on December 27th I wrote this article
[47:20.840 --> 47:24.560]  because every single time in December and January they attack natural products
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.640]  I wrote this article why many vitamin studies are absolutely worthless this was
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.520]  on natural society my natural health website and I talked about specifically
[47:32.520 --> 47:36.440]  how they were going to come about this and attack natural products using
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.200]  synthetics and then claims the same as the other ones so for example it reads
[47:40.200 --> 47:43.520]  the synthetic version of vitamin E is a petrochemically derived analog of
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.720]  natural vitamin E which it is that is capable of just disrupting the endocrine
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.360]  system endocrine system where the natural form of vitamin D is effective
[47:51.360 --> 47:54.360]  against aging oxidative stress and hundreds of other conditions so you
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.400]  have vitamin D you have the synthetic form that's actually destroying your
[47:58.400 --> 48:01.760]  body and is linked to birth defects and then the organic form from the food
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.440]  which is actually linked to preventing aging and so it's a total hoax they
[48:05.440 --> 48:08.680]  bring in the chemical produce petrochemical vitamins and minerals
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.160]  blame it on us and then put out a hoax they literally ship in the petrochemical
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.400]  synthetic vitamins from China and give it to people and then they say oh nothing
[48:18.400 --> 48:21.200]  happened or actually oh it actually damaged the lungs and then they say
[48:21.200 --> 48:26.520]  vitamin E is bad it's kind of like if I were to have an organic banana but then
[48:26.520 --> 48:30.400]  I was to get an organic or just a regular banana shipped in from Fukushima
[48:30.400 --> 48:33.800]  and ate the banana and it gave me radiation poisoning it said bananas are
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.880]  bad they kill people well they do the same thing saying aspartame is safe
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.200]  because it's similar to what's in an orange with that type of sugar but it's
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.000]  not it's actually completely different just similar in the molecule and then
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.840]  they hoax people well it's funny you say that the leading children's vitamin
[48:49.840 --> 48:55.480]  contains aspartame, cupric acid, zinc oxide, sorbitol, hydrogenate oil and GMO
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.080]  corn on record let me see those articles I'll show folks with document cam here we
[48:59.080 --> 49:04.240]  go here's the first page all of these vitamins are containing GMOs they're
[49:04.240 --> 49:10.520]  containing hydrogenated oils, corn starches, zinc oxide, citric oxide, aspartame
[49:10.520 --> 49:14.160]  on record that's linked to peer-reviewed research says at least 40 adverse
[49:14.160 --> 49:17.160]  health effects you know brain tumors across the board and that's what's in
[49:17.160 --> 49:20.800]  these vitamins and the GMOs especially so I'll tell you what this study proves
[49:20.800 --> 49:24.760]  it proves that aspartame GMO and synthetic chemicals are bad and we
[49:24.760 --> 49:27.560]  know we've known that forever we've got to shoot a special report on this and
[49:27.560 --> 49:30.240]  have it go mega viral because folks don't even know how to respond to this
[49:30.240 --> 49:34.520]  they're just going that's not true why do you lie it's beyond lying it's a giant
[49:34.520 --> 49:40.080]  fraud hoax using Fred Flintstone garbage you know stuff from China the Fred
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.080]  let me see your other articles or we can flip the camera and show document cam
[49:43.080 --> 49:47.280]  over there I mean there's there's tons of things but this is that's not even
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.120]  getting to the real bottom line here's the bottom line but beyond all the fact
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.520]  that these vitamins contain aspartame, contain aspartame, GMOs and everything
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.400]  like that every single time let's go back to 2012 again around this time of
[49:59.400 --> 50:03.520]  September late early September I wrote an article with Mike Adams of Natural
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.400]  News it was posted on Natural Society in Natural News it was a major article we
[50:07.400 --> 50:10.280]  found because I woke up in the morning and they were saying you had up the
[50:10.280 --> 50:13.640]  third largest health side out there yeah they were saying organic food is the
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.720]  same as GMO food and this guy from Stanford a highly prestige I remember
[50:17.720 --> 50:22.280]  that yeah it turns out this was the guy he's called the father of statistical
[50:22.280 --> 50:28.760]  lies he worked for Big Tobacco and helped this company the Council of Tobacco
[50:28.760 --> 50:33.760]  Research firm they paid off journalists three million dollars in today's money
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.680]  after adjusting for inflation to promote all this stuff that he did and he said
[50:37.680 --> 50:42.320]  he there's a document from 1976 that we found that shows financial ties between

[54:01.720 --> 54:10.440]  you know there's one reason I tend to get matter and matter as a three-hour show
[54:10.440 --> 54:21.720]  goes on each day and that's because I'm looking at the federal state and
[54:21.720 --> 54:28.600]  university studies on the soils being 99% debilitated I'm looking at the brain
[54:28.600 --> 54:36.880]  damage numbers in utero of the humans developing and then after I'm waiting in
[54:36.880 --> 54:41.400]  the documentation they're taking the good stuff out of the food and putting the
[54:41.400 --> 54:46.520]  bad stuff in it don't have iodine in the bread put bromine in I mean bromide I
[54:46.520 --> 54:52.960]  mean this is homicidal evil it's not our opinion it's a fact and then you've
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.680]  got people connected to big tobacco out saying don't eat organic it's the same
[54:57.680 --> 55:02.560]  as regular they make the milk producers put on the thing when they say we don't
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.120]  have any growth hormone in here this hasn't been proven to cause a problem
[55:06.120 --> 55:09.960]  by the FDA when you wonder why women are taller than men now and going into
[55:09.960 --> 55:15.680]  puberty when they're like seven years old I mean ladies and gentlemen ladies and
[55:15.680 --> 55:21.160]  gentlemen we are all in a giant Petri dish being experimented on and then I've
[55:21.160 --> 55:28.160]  got the major journals here the Senate report 1936 99% of America's nutrient
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.320]  deficient scientific America dirt poor fruits and vegetables become less
[55:32.320 --> 55:39.440]  nutritious then it breaks down University of Texas total plunging and it just
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.120]  keeps dropping and dropping and dropping and then they put this report out
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.280]  and it's pushed everywhere that's what tells you it's a pure BS report I mean
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.040]  automatically you're hearing about it everywhere oh Jerry didn't eat vitamins
[55:50.040 --> 55:53.880]  and minerals they're actually bad for you and then you find out it's a bunch of
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.500]  GMO synthetic garbage they shipped in you know
[55:58.500 --> 56:05.200]  Searle that got bought by Monsanto that created aspartame that's you know in so
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.560]  many thousands of products a large portion of the Reese's monkeys in the
[56:09.560 --> 56:14.280]  70s and one study died that had it added to their mother's milk and so they just
[56:14.280 --> 56:18.640]  removed the ones that died from the study and said no monkeys got sick they
[56:18.640 --> 56:23.480]  just removed the sick and dead monkeys and I mean this is the out of control
[56:23.480 --> 56:27.960]  bonker land because I was psychoanalyzing myself during the break I was very angry
[56:27.960 --> 56:31.800]  during the break I saw the crew looking at me thinking as he matted us and no I
[56:31.800 --> 56:37.320]  am physically want to throw up Anthony they've got a document camera they're
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.120]  into a special report on the nightly news tonight everybody's got to get out
[56:40.120 --> 56:43.360]  and have go viral but this one as well this is gonna be a concise like three
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.240]  minute report we laser beam it again get into that article where they have the
[56:47.240 --> 56:50.920]  big tobacco people saying you don't need organic now I mean go over that I mean
[56:50.920 --> 56:55.840]  this is outrageous so all of these are connected this is a study back from
[56:55.840 --> 57:00.200]  2012 where Dr. Ingram Olkin from Stanford University his team of
[57:00.200 --> 57:03.440]  researchers it turns out they were saying GMO is great it's the same as
[57:03.440 --> 57:06.920]  organic you know everything's fine you don't even need vitamins and it turns
[57:06.920 --> 57:12.200]  out this guy was working with the big tobacco the council for the tobacco
[57:12.200 --> 57:16.680]  research industry the council of tobacco research CTR they were paying off
[57:16.680 --> 57:20.080]  journalists after adjusting for inflation it's three million dollars in
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.640]  today's dollars and they were paying them saying yeah everything's fine just use
[57:24.640 --> 57:29.040]  Dr. Ingram's statistical lie he's actually been called the chief statistical
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.600]  liar for big tobacco the father of statistical lies and he created a
[57:33.600 --> 57:38.040]  statistical algorithm which made anything he wanted to happen so if he did a
[57:38.040 --> 57:44.000]  study where 50 people out of 51 you know got lung cancer from smoking cigarettes
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.320]  he could make it so that you know there was no correlation he would just remove
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.440]  the 50 exactly but it was very detailed and people couldn't crack it and this is
[57:51.440 --> 57:56.000]  the same guy that says organic foods bad based on his statistics so he's been
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.720]  at it and it gets deeper though these guys this whole wing of Stanford has
[57:59.720 --> 58:05.360]  deep ties to Cargill which was again the major major food manufacturer that was
[58:05.360 --> 58:10.400]  supporting Monsanto and was against GMO labeling for prop 37 in California so
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.640]  they're getting money from these GMO juggernauts to say their organic foods
[58:14.640 --> 58:17.840]  bad and then this all ties in because this time of year they always attack
[58:17.840 --> 58:21.380]  organic foods and supplements and if we dig deep on these three studies they
[58:21.380 --> 58:26.000]  met analysis that came out today I guarantee we'll find ties to GMO Cargill
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.600]  and everything we've already found them you go dig get ready for the nightly
[58:28.600 --> 58:33.560]  news great job Anthony Gucciardi but this is just completely and totally
[58:33.560 --> 58:37.680]  outrageous that this is going on we're going to be right back with the second
[58:37.680 --> 58:44.400]  hour tell your friends and family to tune in thank you for listening to GCN

[59:03.560 --> 59:08.080]  adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the
[59:08.080 --> 59:12.640]  parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride

[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:34.520]  again being a really nasty mood because we went over probably I don't know 15
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:42.560]  different studies and articles looking at this big hoax study the sound saying
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.000]  that if you are getting proper nutrition you don't need vitamins and minerals
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.360]  that's like saying if you've gotten enough to eat you don't need to eat more
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.000]  or it's like saying if you're getting oxygen already you don't need oxygen and
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.120]  then they use synthetic vitamins from China in the study it's the same crude
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.920]  you know that was telling us cigarettes are good for us the same
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.160]  scientists that are putting that out are now saying organic foods the same as
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:12.080]  regular it's like who grass-fed beef how rare cows aren't supposed to eat awful
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.400]  that's what they call it awful the ground-up dead cows dogs stuff from the
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:22.520]  pet you know you know vets a lot of that sell sell your dead animals they get
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.040]  shipped off and rendered down and fed back to your animals you look it up you
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.720]  don't believe me and what you will discover upon looking at that is they
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:42.200]  feed cows meat ground-up meat they call it protein and they also feed them a
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:50.600]  blood blood meal baby calves are not supposed to drink blood they mix it up
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.000]  turning into a liquid or put it in their feed and I know that's a big
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.920]  conspiracy theory maybe they have a study out baby cows that eat blood are
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.360]  just as good for you to eat or or later to you know get milk from when they're
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.360]  females then if they ate grass it's like man listen to that weirdo he says cows
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:15.400]  cows eat grass and don't drink blood remember mad cow in England when they
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:21.000]  were taking rotten sheep and goats and cows and horses and grinding them all
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.640]  up and feeding it to cows and I've got to sit here and explain to people the
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:35.920]  madness of this it makes my blood boil Matt Dubiel to break down Chicago lands

[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.960]  government being established I mean they've been building with these
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.320]  partnerships towards this but this is definitely getting up close to the
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:17.160]  capstone so that's coming up as well I need to settle down though I need to
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:25.840]  settle down maintain calm maintain calm and just move forward but there is a
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.480]  total assault on every form of liberty ladies and gentlemen the globalists are
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.720]  coming in when states and cities and counties pass laws to not Florida their
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.240]  water the feds are coming in and lobbying to get laws passed to make it

[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.720]  and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:25.520]  thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the

[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.400]  to have the editor of the new American magazine coming on to talk about the
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:09:00.320]  secretive partnership with Asia that waves national sovereignty to a level
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:06.200]  never before seen and William F. Jasper calls it worse than Obamacare and I
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.040]  agree with his analysis then Larry Klayman will be joining us the
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.400]  constitutional lawyer who has wreaked havoc on the establishment the last two
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.880]  decades he got the win in court yesterday in federal court with a judge
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.000]  saying well clearly this violates the Constitution to have just total
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.880]  warrantless dragnet spying on everybody I mean if we don't have a fourth
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.520]  amendment there then we don't have any fourth amendment so Larry Klayman will
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:42.320]  be joining us and Politico makes fun of him and says Larry Klayman crows on
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:50.120]  NSA we hit the motherload and they make it sound like you know it's a joke or
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.920]  something when he's saying the motherload of exposing this criminal
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.600]  activity and having one of the biggest constitutional decisions in our lifetimes
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.440]  and I agree with him so that's coming up judge NSA domestic phone data mining
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:09.200]  unconstitutional undoubtedly and the media is debating is it is it right will
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.720]  the judge get struck down I mean my goodness folks they're spying on
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.920]  everything on record and got caught lying about it they are impeached they
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.880]  are liars they have no credibility and it's being used against the press against
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.000]  political enemies against the Tea Party against the Associated Press not Al
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.720]  Qaeda so Larry Klayman will join us today at 2 o'clock going into overdrive some

[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:01.840]  setting up likely appeals and further challenges to the data mining revealed by
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.920]  classified leaker Edward Snowden Snowden is a hero folks not a zero he
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.860]  exposed illegal criminal mass spying by private corporations in league with
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:16.760]  private defense contractors and government for political and economic
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.880]  control just like the big banks who's NSA data to beat their competition and
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.840]  stuff folks that's all coming out this is about insiders ruling over us they're
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.520]  all secret about their info but they want to know all of your info so the
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.040]  worm is turning this is a big big deal they're gonna try to spin this they're
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.040]  gonna try to change people's minds and say oh well let's be adult about it like
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.240]  Hayden the former NSA director was saying this weekend on the news we got to
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.680]  do this to keep you safe who keeps us safe from you we've seen what you've
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.720]  done they've got federal grants for warrantless checkpoints threatening
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.280]  people into giving DNA all over the country new news on that is an info
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:03.240]  wars dot com they're telling people they can't have lemon-naked stands
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.280]  nationwide they're arresting people are threatening to arrest them who watched
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.720]  their car in their own yard police are coming in houses constantly without
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.800]  warrants now they've got drones in the skies they're buying billions of bullets
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.240]  they're training for warfare with us the government is acting totally arrogant
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:26.520]  America has gotten a case of tyranny yet again now I want to go to this article
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.760]  that's on prison planet calm by Paul Watson NSA director Alexander has to
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:41.800]  ask permission to answer a question and that's because himself and clapper the
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.200]  head of cybersecurity and the rest of it go to Congress and say we don't spy on
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.440]  you without warrants there is no dragnet and it's clearly a lie and clearly
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.880]  illegal and so he's got to literally lean back to the shadow government to the
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.360]  bureaucrats that never leave and say can I answer that question but then it
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:13.560]  dovetails with the founder of PayPal saying that we should just do whatever
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.520]  the government says we should just trust them remember they weren't spying on as
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.520]  they said they didn't have hubs and all the telecommunications companies
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.760]  grabbing everything like I told you they did in 1996 18 years ago they weren't
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.520]  doing any of this you're crazy if you say they are Bush gave press conferences
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.760]  seven years ago I'll never forget I was in Los Angeles working on the
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:41.000]  distribution of loose change final cut I'll never forget sitting there in
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.960]  Charlie Sheen's house of all places watching Bush's live press conference
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.360]  during the day I was off that day they're working on that and it's on a big
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:56.280]  screen TV that covered the whole wall and it was Bush going yeah I promise we
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.720]  don't do anything without warrants it's only for Alcada I promise I promise and
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.120]  of course it came out a month later was all total lies then they go oh we don't
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.920]  have hubs and all the telecommunications that's all lies lie lie lie lie lie lie
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.520]  lie they're using it for political persecution and the founder of PayPal on
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:30.920]  Charlie Rose's show literally says that we need to just trust the government this
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.360]  isn't a government it's private interests that have hijacked us that pay
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.520]  ten billion dollars of taxpayer money to move General Motors to China that are
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.640]  shutting down our power plants that are getting rid of our bill of rights that
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.240]  teach the kids nationwide two plus two equals five obey the state the name
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.480]  father and mother is abusive they are screwing our country over they are an
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:58.520]  enemy of course they're saying trust us like in Mars attacks where the aliens
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.480]  are running around shooting people in Las Vegas with ray guns we should have
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:06.000]  that as a liner going out to break they go don't run we are your friends and the
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.360]  people stop and get shot that's a joke about psych warfare in history
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:16.520]  helm in World War one they found with loudspeakers they would say lay down
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.600]  your guns we're helping we're coming to help we're not firing even as the
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.280]  Germans would fire and fire their their mortars and their cannons and their
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.400]  machine guns and go after everybody as all of that happened as all of that went
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.000]  on they found the Germans did it first the French and allies were doing it
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.160]  later in German that people would actually lay down their guns we don't
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.120]  have to fight they want to be friends as they jump over and bayonet you we're
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:45.160]  your friends we want to help you drink your fluoride water take your GMO you

[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:01.720]  the Ukraine the founder of it lavshin is the guy on here the founder of PayPal
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.040]  year younger than I am clearly chosen to be able to deploy this by the powers
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.800]  that be on record working with the NSA here he is after the NSA director talks
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.960]  saying we should just trust him and do whatever they say here it is did the
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.720]  NSA actually find a foreign power that had identified this capability and
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:26.280]  discussed using it offensively I need time out on that I am probably
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.960]  uncharacteristically pro national security agencies writ large and NSA in
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:35.320]  particular despite the fact that they would not hire me at some point I
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:38.760]  actually wanted to work for the NSA and I was not a US citizen and that I just
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:46.040]  fundamentally trust the national security establishment to care about the
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.720]  citizens trade I would be willing to make security and liberty security and
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.600]  privacy anytime you trade liberty for security you get neither that's Benjamin
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.080]  Franklin do you feel secure with this government this is I love how they ask
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:09.320]  Alexander the head of the NSA they asking foreign powers because of Snowden
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.000]  know what we're doing as if the foreign powers don't know you're looking at an
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.800]  officer of the globalist the corporate foreign power they are the foreign power
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.560]  we are occupied now where else have we heard we should just fundamentally trust
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.920]  them even though they're caught lying and abusing us and doing insider deals
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.480]  constantly we should fundamentally trust people who are debasing the currency
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.840]  devaluing the currency wrecking our industrial base teaching our kids two
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.400]  plus two equals five teaching them fatherhood and motherhood is bad open
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.840]  weaponized culture teaching kids death education how to commit suicide putting
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:48.840]  20% of the kids on psychotropic their goals 50% an open criminal group I mean
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.080]  you look at Charlie Rose and all of them just total slime bags I'd walk to the
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.720]  other side of the street not to walk by them openly disingenuous openly evil
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:06.720]  they don't even hide it well all a bunch of hunchback demons literal armies of
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.800]  slimy golems marching forward and they have all the pop icons saying do
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.480]  whatever they say submit to them just like Britney Spears honestly I think we
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.680]  should just trust our president and every decision that he makes and we should
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.880]  just support that you know and be faithful and what happens do you trust
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:29.520]  this person yes and of course almost every time I watch Miss America or Miss
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.000]  Teen USA the clips online they say the same thing like how do you be a good
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.240]  American USA such as South America South Africa I just want to do the
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.560]  analysis in fact here is that same spirit this this this is who they think we
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.660]  all are they think we're all Britney Spears ready to be run over by the new
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:53.400]  world order and they tell us mercury I'm gonna play this later journal
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.760]  pediatric is good for your brain but vitamins are vitamins and minerals bad
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:04.360]  mercury good here it is I personally believe that yes Americans are unable
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:12.280]  to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have bounce and I
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.520]  believe that our education like such as in South Africa Iraq everywhere like
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:25.240]  such as and I believe that they should our education over here in the US should
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:30.440]  help the US or should help South Africa it should help the Iraq and the Asian
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:37.120]  countries so we will be able to build up our future or thank you very much

[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:31.560]  now I already covered this in detail in the last hour but I want to mention it
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.280]  again ahead of a guest joining us then we've got the lawyer who brought the
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.040]  case and won it at the federal court on the NSA domestic phone data mining
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.080]  unconstitutional Larry Klayman is going to be joining us coming up but before I
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:51.080]  go any further it makes me very very angry to every year but this time is a
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.800]  mega push in the media to hear them say you don't need vitamins and minerals in
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.320]  fact that they could be bad for you and they put out these big pharma funded
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.600]  studies and then have the mainstream media push it because they know full
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.120]  well our soils are depleted so that's why they say here supplementing the diet
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.520]  of a well-nourished adults with most mineral and vitamin supplements has no
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:19.120]  clear benefit and might be harmful that's out of CBS news with this
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.600]  ridiculous study that we just queue up where they say mercury is good for you
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.840]  again in the journal pediatrics I'm not joking when I say they say that they
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.040]  said cigarettes were good for you to using some of the same companies and
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.720]  groups and we're going to cover that tonight on the nightly news we already
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.760]  covered it last hour we're going to show you the documents so GMOs good for you
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.160]  cigarettes are good for you but vitamins and minerals aren't good and then in the
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:49.120]  study they use GMO Chinese produced synthetic vitamins which we pointed out
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:54.320]  can hurt you but the key here is they say the diet of a well-nourished adult
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:00.840]  see if you don't have enough nourishment you're in trouble so see that's the game
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.040]  it's like saying you don't need water if you've already had plenty of water you
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.400]  don't need air if you're already breathed plenty of air it's like somebody
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.760]  who's you know living at ground zero somebody who's living at you know not in
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.320]  a high altitude somebody that's living at sea level doesn't need oxygen
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.120]  assistance but if you're 25,000 feet up in the Himalayas you do you see that's
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.440]  how they play these games yes I don't need oxygen assistance but if I was in
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.400]  the Himalayas I would ladies and gentlemen you understand that the game
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.440]  they're playing and we live in the Himalayas of depleted vitamins and
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:45.840]  minerals here it is right here 1936 US Senate report soil depleted 99% and
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:51.400]  99% of Americans nutrient deficient boom scientific American University of
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:56.600]  Texas major study journal the American College of Nutrition study a 50 year
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:02.960]  study studying vegetables and fruits in the US found a massive reduction in
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:09.800]  vitamins minerals and most important trace elements scientific American boom
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.040]  so see it's true it's true you know it's like saying you don't need oxygen if
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.160]  you're getting plenty of oxygen but you need an oxygen tank 500 feet under the
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.480]  ocean yeah you do the government used to put iodine in the salt and the bread
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.640]  now they said we want it out and then you see the lowering IQ the Burt effects
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.120]  everything that's on record to come with it let me show you some of that let me
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.560]  show you some of those headlines how adding iodine to salt resulted in a
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.320]  decades worth of IQ gates United States 15 point IQ increase within two years
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:48.440]  US government study 1925 but then later they said take it out of there because
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.880]  they want you dumb it wasn't as evil a federal government before that oh but
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.920]  there it is co-author of flawed Stanford organic studies saying organic isn't
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.480]  good has deep ties to big tobacco anti science propaganda folks I'm gonna tell
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.640]  you tobacco will give you lung cancer if you live long enough okay it's highly
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.280]  addictive it's not good for me especially with all the additives okay
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.920]  that's not a conspiracy it's fact mercury's bad for you even if they come
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.320]  out and say mercury's good for you containing vaccines may help not harm
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.360]  kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:30.560]  why it's my concerns at mercury's exactly let me declare this it's a hoax that
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.960]  you don't need vitamins and minerals you need organic high-quality vitamins and

[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:23.800]  the GCN radio network we have discovered cargill connections to
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.480]  Stanford and this study that we're going to be breaking tonight on the nightly
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:34.000]  news now I knew I'd already found these connections but we've now confirmed them
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:42.280]  this is bomb shell and of course we're talking about the new study that's out
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.520]  that the media is pushing everywhere saying you don't need vitamins and
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.160]  minerals if you have a nutritious diet that's like saying you don't need air if
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.400]  you already have it you don't need water if you've already had your eight
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.080]  glasses or whatever but if you haven't had water you do need it
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:02.200]  unbelievable deception and we're going to hit it from every angle but of course
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:07.720]  we knew who'd be behind this big pharma and the government the same people that
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:11.200]  had the journal pediatrics put out a report saying mercury is good for your
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.680]  child's brain okay do you have any idea what mercury does the brain and
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:22.280]  electron electron microscope it literally shows the mercury frying it and I want
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.680]  to get some of the American delegates of Codex Alimentarius on I was on
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.000]  vacation at the beach for about three days a few months ago and just got
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  hooked on actually watching hours of feeds I just walked down the beach for
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.600]  like two hours and two hours back my wife's like where have you been and you
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.560]  didn't hang out with the kids like you're right I would just walk listening to
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:49.760]  YouTube videos not really watching them of Codex Alimentarius debates over three
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:53.600]  days I probably watched six seven hours of it or listen to it and they were
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.720]  admitting that they'd already lowered the standards where where they say you
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.520]  don't really need vitamin C so we're going to lower the standard to a level
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.680]  where it would cost you a hundred euros to get the amount that Linus Pauling
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.640]  recommended you have every day you want the Nobel Prize for that Dr. Linus
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.520]  Pauling and they just keep lowering it and lowering it where you can't get it
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.080]  and the soils are debased in Europe as they are here especially because they
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.240]  use the chemical fertilizers now that make the plants grow who need three
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:26.440]  nutrients you need the government says close to 70 many scientists say 90 so
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.440]  you're getting three vitamins or minerals ladies and gentlemen in many
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.280]  cases or you're getting synthetic forms that they add to all these processed
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.320]  foods that are that whose molecules are similar but not the same and are very
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.720]  toxic and when you learn this it makes you very very angry because when they
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.760]  put iodine in the salt it made IQs go up and made birth defects go down I've
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.640]  shown you the studies then the government basically ordered it taken out and
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:57.120]  then bad halogens put in that is so cold-blooded folks the the public is in a
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.120]  fog for so many reasons but the biggest one is the iodine conspiracy and that's
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.200]  why I think everybody for Christmas should go to infowarslife.com
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.400]  we've already tried it you're blown away by it we have a special running on
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.680]  survival shield and the fluoride shield products proprietary right now because
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.120]  you get the two together with a big discount 25% off the fluoride shield
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.600]  you get them together it's twice the size of the survival shield it's two ounces
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:25.440]  and yes that then ends up funding the radio show in the news division but I
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.760]  take this stuff at first I can only take the recommended dose I recommend you
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.480]  talk to your physician now I take about three times me personally what is
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.480]  recommended because we got a follow it FDA stuff and I can personally do whatever
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.240]  I want what it's done for my skin what it's done for my it's just it's everything
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.000]  doctor group and others said and again the government used to order this put
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.600]  in the food supply well that you know the garbage bound stuff but it's still
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.280]  good your body can break it down this is the proprietary pure you put this on
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:02.720]  paper it turns bright purple blue is what the real crystals of iodine look
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.000]  like real iodine out in the open will just eat through the floor folks like
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.200]  alien acid or something but in your body it's just unbelievable and it's in the
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:15.360]  nascent form patented injected in it's simply amazing in full wars life dot

[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.600]  placebo where people are psychosomatic you think or whatever because I've tried
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.280]  all these vitamins and minerals and stuff and I mean I only go with the
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:44.160]  stuff that blew my socks off and this blew my socks off info wars life dot

[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.960]  shows that's coming up I wanted to get him on to pick his brain about Chicago
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.440]  because I've been to Chicago many times my cousin lives in Chicago beautiful
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:36.720]  city amazing views a lot of great theaters a lot of great culture a
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:41.400]  million things to do I like the people in Chicago I mean like I said I got family
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.880]  lives up there great place to visit and only certain areas are obviously have
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:50.120]  the high crime rates but what is it like to live under the mayor whose brother
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.840]  of course wrote Obamacare and admits they're trying to bankrupt the country
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:57.600]  basically and bring in socialism what is it like with them I heard doubling
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:01.680]  property taxes when you sell your property well what are they thinking in
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.960]  Chicago in their push to ignore federal rulings they've got to give people gun
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.920]  rights what is it like Matt Dubiel is an American patriot to be living right in
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.680]  the epicenter of the New World Order and what's the feedback you get from your
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.440]  listeners now Alex not only did his brother write the bill but his other
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:26.880]  brother is Ari the the super agent that is is the the character and entourage is
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.560]  based out of and these guys know how to negotiate they know how to rule and they
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.600]  know how to make sweeping changes and influence people and I don't know
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.960]  anybody that lives in downtown Chicago our mutual friend man cow used to live
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.040]  in the city he recently moved out to the suburbs I mean there was a time Alex
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  when you could go down there and you could park for a quarter fifty cents a
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.200]  dollar now the parking is outsourced to another company which it might be owned
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.400]  by a German company our Chicago parking you've got taxes you've got gunshots
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:05.160]  you've got just an outrageous area and and it's dripping out to the suburbs so
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:08.040]  you have folks like me that live out in the suburbs and have lived here for a
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.520]  long time and all we hear about is ROM this and the Chicago schools but my
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.720]  kids don't go to Chicago schools but you know it's like you said there's a lot
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:20.320]  of good things about Chicago I went to the the Bears game the other night
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.440]  Monday Night Football and and did cuz number was retired and it was a big
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.320]  deal and I had free tickets so we went there was nobody there no one now it was
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:33.760]  cold it gets cold here in Chicago but that doesn't typically stop Chicago
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.320]  bear fans from going to Chicago games I saw the same thing happen at the
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:41.280]  Cleveland Pittsburgh game the other day where the Pittsburgh Stadium was darn
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.920]  near empty well why is that why why is it that all of the storefronts that are
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:52.520]  for lease the retail spaces are empty something is going on and it's not it's
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:56.360]  not by accident I don't think Chicago starting to feel a lot like Detroit
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:59.840]  these days well that's the plan and after they've imploded it they'll buy it
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.400]  from pennies on the dollar then make it an economic development zone and give
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:09.440]  themselves tax exemption they know what they're doing as gangsters and I know
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.480]  there's pushback everybody I talked to from Illinois which is a great state
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.440]  with great people looks at the actual city of Chicago that's small compared to
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:23.200]  the suburbs as a cancer how do you finally kick the gangsters out of there
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.840]  that run things how do you finally you know deal with that cancer because just
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:32.880]  like New York City tries to dominate the rest of the country Chicago politicians
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.520]  are trying to tell everybody else what to do they're always calling for troops
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.240]  on the streets martial law to fix the problem they created by not letting
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.320]  citizens have guns well yeah I tell you I don't know what you do but I know what
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.880]  you don't do and what you don't do is tell citizens in the Chicago in the
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.560]  actual city I mean I live in the suburbs so you can have firearms in the
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:59.160]  suburbs it's not ruled under Chicago ordinances and so on but in Chicago
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:03.680]  people that abide by the rules people that have legal guns can't have legal
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.120]  guns even in some of the suburbs on the outskirts that are very close to the
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:13.200]  city same thing like Oak Park and other areas so what you don't do is take guns
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.440]  away from the good people you know I it breaks my heart to see people on
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:21.160]  television you see these poor mothers and their child was was hit by stray gunfire
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.600]  in a bad neighborhood and maybe they can't leave but I'll tell you what I
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.800]  would do I would leave I wouldn't stick around to try and fight for my
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.800]  neighborhood I would leave because if they're not gonna let you protect
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.000]  yourself you know long it takes for 911 to get to your home in Chicago they've
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.600]  also all the videos in Chicago where folks beat each other to death are they
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.360]  gonna cut our hands off to make sure that doesn't happen anymore well yeah I
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.760]  mean you have flash mobs going through Chicago stores organizing on the
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.320]  internet you have gang bangers you have drug cartels I mean it's no secret there
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:59.280]  are huge drug cartels operating in Chicago and I don't I think they have a
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.440]  lot of resources I think with the resources of the the local government
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.920]  the state government the Chicago government and all the other entities
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:09.920]  they should be able to figure out where those guys are cut off their supply and
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.920]  get busy but they don't do that what they're doing is they're coming after
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.960]  guys like me that live in the city and saying well you can't have a gun we
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.720]  we can't let you have a gun in the in the city Chicago guns don't work that's
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.960]  because the government wants the monopoly of power and force over the
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.120]  people but I see the average American the average person but Illinois really
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.120]  getting it now that big government has caused the problems it's not the
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  solution Matt WL again great manager of our a fine affiliate up there in
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.920]  Chicago 1530 where do you expect short term midterm long term where does your
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:48.800]  gut tell you this country's going you know it's it's scary because every year
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:53.880]  I have four little kids are married I got kids ranging from 11 my youngest is
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.280]  gonna be two in February and every year we take a summer road trip we drive
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.600]  around the country the great United States of America and the last two years
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.880]  we did a loop-to-loop we went through Ohio and we went down to Nashville and
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:13.320]  last this last summer we went up to New Jersey and back and as we drove through
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:19.640]  I saw firsthand the America that most of us don't see most of the people in
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.920]  in Austin don't see it we live in very privileged areas the rest of the country
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.680]  looks like a bomb fell on it the rest of the country looks like its third
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:34.720]  world the rest of the country is is decap it's it's completely destroyed you
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.600]  got billboards where you know companies just stopped advertising on them
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.920]  because nobody's driving down that highway the the the papers blowing in the
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.600]  wind and I'm driving through there and I'm thinking to myself my gosh boy when
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:50.000]  my grandparents took my father and his brothers and sisters around the country
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.680]  to the Grand Canyon and stuff there was the majesty and the wonderment of
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:58.240]  traveling down Route 66 and seeing these great little shops and these great
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.600]  little restaurants and these great diners where is it I don't know where it is
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.760]  but I'll tell you what I saw in downtown Indianapolis 80% vacancies stores that
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:11.280]  are closed stores that aren't even open on a Saturday at five o'clock ice cream
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.640]  shops that have nobody there I'm seeing it here you know we live in a very affluent
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:21.160]  suburb okay and and DuPage County is is pretty pretty well off in general lots
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.360]  of business ace and McDonald's and all these big companies are based here and
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.320]  you drive around and you go to some of these stores you go to some of the
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.480]  grocery stores in the big box stores there's more managers than there are
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.720]  customers there's more employees than there are customers and you can't get
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:42.040]  any help so I look back and I think to myself like well what would my
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.840]  grandfather say if he saw this you can't have a store it doesn't take a
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.240]  rocket scientist to figure out you can't have a huge store with huge property
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.120]  and huge overhead and huge heating bills and have nobody buying in the store
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.760]  something's got to change and I'll tell you the the fast track to ruining that
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.800]  is raising minimum wage and having them pay the employees more because I'll tell
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.880]  you what they're gonna cut those employees back all those guys standing
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.720]  around at that store waiting for customers they're gonna cut those guys
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.720]  look at Obamacare making everybody go like a third of the population from 40
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:18.640]  hours or more down to 29 20 it's happening listen Austin is per capita
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:24.280]  the wealthiest area the fastest growing the best place in America and I've
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.880]  lived here since high school and I grew up in Dallas I go back to Dallas it
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:33.720]  looks like a bomb hit it it looks like when I've been in bad cities in Mexico
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:39.880]  it is falling apart the people are freaked out the affluent areas have
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:45.600]  wear and tear on them it's not the wealthy town I grew up in Austin most the
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.180]  restaurants I know have shut down even the trendy places aren't busy most
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:54.000]  nights movie theaters are empty when you go to them they have literally gutted
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.280]  this country we're in a decade into a depression with them telling us that we've
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.000]  never even been in a recession and and and their answer is more taxes in fact
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.800]  man cow was telling me I read about this news they doubled property taxes when
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.400]  you sell your house I mean is that accurate Matt Dubio well I live in the
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:16.680]  suburbs so a Chicago property taxes I can't speak to from yeah but he said I
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.680]  mean I looked it up they said they did it but the point is is that is that he had
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.720]  to sell his place I mean this is insane well you know what it comes down to the
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:28.600]  other part of Chicago is is the schools are deplorable God bless some of those
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.880]  teachers that are going in there I know that there's great teachers and this is
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.960]  the downside of talking about a problem that's this big it's it's the big
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:39.640]  elephant in the room and the minute you start to talk about it great teachers
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:43.480]  feel slighted there's tons of great teachers in there but I got to tell you
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:48.120]  the Chicago schools are and have been in trouble because the curriculum is two
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.600]  plus two equals five and the name father and mother is abusive I mean they're
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.480]  given curricula curriculum that is meant to screw the kids up common core and
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.320]  new math new math was the first problem common core was the second problem and
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.080]  then you have to start asking yourself well okay am I gonna send my kids to
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.400]  private school well okay let's get around to the same curriculum now they're
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:12.080]  accredited exactly except you have to pay a premium for it so then what are you
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.920]  gonna I sent my children to home school academy two days a week and they were
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.960]  nice Christian folks that ran at hundreds of kids but they said to be
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.000]  accredited they had workbooks from Michelle Obama yeah and it and then we
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.240]  went to another home school group same deal they've taken over folks I mean
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:33.800]  it's we're in a cult I'm sorry go ahead well you know it's one of these things
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.360]  where you go out and you go to the movies and if it's a popular movie here
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.040]  the movie theater is packed and then you come out of the movie theater and you
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:44.440]  look at the five stores next to the movie theater there's nothing there they
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:48.920]  used to be maybe a Jamba Juice exact same thing here it's it's everywhere and
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.880]  and Alex you you call in and I run a business so I'm looking for space from
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.800]  time to time and I know you guys have to you call these places and and they don't
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.080]  want to negotiate they want to tell you well here's what the price is well
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.760]  typically I you know call me crazy but when supply goes up and the man on
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.360]  listen listen we finally find good places to get vitamins and minerals we
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.920]  call up we go we want about a thousand bottles that a month they just go nah we
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:17.480]  don't feel like it we don't want to and and and and come people don't have it's
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:22.000]  a movie I think you're hitting on it Matt people now don't even have the drive
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.120]  to be successful and I think it's a spiritual thing it's not just economic
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  have you found that I think it's gosh you know and I just kind of got chills it
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.800]  yes I think there's a combination of a spiritual thing I read an article might
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.520]  have been through it info wars about people getting in anxiety from you know
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:44.800]  being on on their smartphones all the time and and becoming connected to the
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:49.600]  web or or to devices it's causing anxiety attacks from the computer screen
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.200]  flicker especially the new screens anxiety disorders are way up well and it
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.400]  used to be we'd sit around the table have a cup of coffee and talk to each other
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.200]  and and I you know I'm not a hundred years old I'm not here to tell you that
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:05.080]  it was so much better in the 30s and and now that you just hit what it is it's
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:09.240]  the last decade and the smartphones are rewiring everybody's brains mine
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:13.160]  included and people now don't want to talk they want to live in a long long
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.280]  land looking at their little baby computer and those of us that are
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:19.640]  somewhat resistant or immune to it we're gonna end up inheriting the earth
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:22.760]  because I'm telling you the general public doesn't have interpersonal skills
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.840]  they don't have work ethic they don't have anything I've got to hire like ten
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.400]  people now to find two or three good folks and I've got a great crew now I
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.120]  know exactly what you mean and you do have a great crew but it's a it's a
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:37.280]  it's a full-time job to find those great people that you have because you have
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.640]  this it's like panhandling for gold you have every every business owner and
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:45.400]  executive I talked to tells me they've never seen anything like it it's like
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.800]  day of the dead it is folks it's the vaccines it's the GMO is everything I
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:55.040]  mean we look I'm not on some high horse either I'm I work out hard and I've
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:58.200]  gotten a little bit healthier but I still look like a slob I mean they are

[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:16.840]  hour it's always optional and we've got Larry claiming the lawyer that won
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.920]  against the NSA pointing out that it's unconstitutional it's gonna be a very
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:24.760]  important interview coming up the start of the fourth hour we've got William F.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:30.680]  Jasper breaking down the Pacific partnership of the Transpacific
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:34.040]  partnership that the dwarf sending global government move ever seen at eight
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:40.800]  after till five after a Matt Doobie L joins us from 1530 WCKG dot com and by
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:44.960]  the way if you're listening to us in Chicago it is so important on our AM and
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.960]  FM affiliates all over the United States that you tell people about the station
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.960]  it is such a blessing to be on AM and FM that is still the vast majority of our
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:58.360]  listenership and that's where you can really tell people hey tune in and a lot
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.680]  of their lineup with Peter Schiff and others really exposed as what's
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:06.760]  happening and we're in an info war so it's precious to have stations in big
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.160]  cities around the United States and I intend to try to get more station
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.040]  managers and owners on because they're always so interesting you've heard some
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.120]  of them on the show that if you're a station manager owner and you've got an
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.080]  idea of coming on we'd like to see you run it past us send that to show tips
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:23.440]  and info wars dot com or contact GCN because we always like to get your
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.880]  perspective and once a week or so we ought to have a station owner or manager
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:31.160]  on to talk about what's happening in your area but I cannot tell you how
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.080]  important it is to be supportive of their sponsors or to become sponsors talk
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:40.720]  about helping fund the info war the most essential thing to do is to be a
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:45.840]  sponsor or a supporter of the sponsors of our AM and FM affiliates now going
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.680]  back to Matt Dubey L you were making the point that something's wrong with
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.760]  people and and I have the statistics the numbers here toddlers obsessed with
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.040]  iPads and it's hurting their development ABC news I've got a another one right
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:04.680]  here adults ending at 25 last you go into puberty earlier but then act like a
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.640]  baby until you're older we are screwed up and it's not all by design a lot of it
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.920]  is this decadent society that we all contribute to I'm gonna be honest with
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:17.560]  you Matt I more and more like wake up in the middle of the night thinking get my
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.680]  family shell everything run to a deserted island somewhere in the South
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:26.080]  Pacific but then I realize we're not gonna beat this plague by running now I
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.640]  in and I've been the same way you know I have four kids I've lived in in the
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.000]  Midwest my whole life everything I have is here my grandparents got blessed
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.400]  and are both 95 years old and they're they're here my father yeah everyone is
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:43.160]  here I've never entertained the idea and in fact I didn't even want to travel
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.480]  much over the last couple years because of business I started to travel a little
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.680]  bit and I meet a lot of these guys that are really big into this expat movement
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.120]  where they moved to Chile or Belize or wherever and my thing has always been
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:03.480]  especially I'm I'm very patriotic and and certainly that alignment has changed
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.200]  over the years the idea of being an American you don't want to give up the
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  fort right well and and what being an American is supposed to be is what I'm
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:16.200]  for I'm not necessarily gonna stand here and blindly salute a flag that that is
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.800]  being run by people that have no idea what they're doing exactly I got to stop
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.720]  you right there do five more minutes with us and finish your point about what
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.280]  it means to be an American and where you see this going Matt Dubey L but
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:29.560]  briefly tell folks about the Las Vegas event and you've got some free tickets
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:33.480]  available for our listeners only yeah so we're having an event it's called
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:36.560]  passport to freedom I've learned that people are pretty much in two camps
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.240]  they're either in the camp that we're in the stay-in fight or they're in the
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.520]  flight camp and they want to get out of dodge and they want to go live somewhere
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.280]  else so we got a three-day event it's called passport to freedom we're gonna
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:50.600]  give away some tickets to Alex Jones listeners I got six tickets to give away
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.160]  and it's gonna be in January in Las Vegas off this trip it's not super
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:58:00.240]  expensive and usually these events are in Panama or someplace out of the
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:04.320]  country and we've lined Peter Schiff up to be our keynote he does afternoons on
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.640]  the same station here on WCKG Jeff Burwick we got a Bitcoin expert we got
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:14.280]  second passport experts and it's split so it's for guys like me and you that
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.000]  want to stay here and kind of shore things up while we're staying here or
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.600]  there's also some content there for people you know I said I can't go but
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.960]  I'm telling you I'm tempted to go just because I want to look at this stuff
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:29.360]  myself it's funny I brought that up because because that's what this is
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:34.840]  about but also how to survive it if you stay or if you go I just I'm afraid if
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:38.720]  I go I'm gonna end up leaving the country I'm just gonna be honest with everybody
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:41.760]  we'll be right back
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:50.080]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:56.280]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:01.520]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:05.600]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:10.240]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.680]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:21.040]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:25.640]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.640]  think that they've been enrolled haven't been enrolled so it's just fraud on top
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:16.800]  of fraud on top of fraud Obama has the worst approval rating since Nixon and

[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.840]  been trying to get him back on as a guest lately so maybe the only way I can
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.840]  make him be a guest is if I go out there and grab him by the arm and like a cave
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.840]  man throw him over my shoulder and march him over to the radio booth I'm
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.520]  joking but I tell folks about what's gonna happen at this event coming up so

[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:16.800]  people how to kind of stay put and just deal with less of the BS and then there's
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.200]  going to be guys that teach people how to start making plans to maybe get rid of
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.520]  some things scale back and maybe move to greener pastures wherever those might
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:28.480]  be so we're gonna give away six tickets to Alex Jones fans people that go to

[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.240]  listening can't see it but that's how my grandparents lived to be I've gone to

[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:57.400]  what do you make of them coming out and saying now if you have all the nutrients
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.160]  you need you don't need vitamins and minerals that's like saying if you have
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:06.080]  an oxygen tank at 200 feet under the water you don't need oxygen if you
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:09.200]  don't have it you've got to absolutely have it it's a total

[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:31.560]  is is you know typically when you try and take vitamins they're giving you niacin
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.200]  and other knockoffs of the vitamin so that's right there's all the synthetic
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.120]  crud you got to get the real thing which they use in these studies as well

[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:09.920]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.800]  ability of the American people so why are the social engineers adding it to the
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:18.880]  water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.040]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:27.080]  water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies I am extremely

[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.920]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans

[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:18.200]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:42.960]  yeah that's what Obama and the globalists are doing they are deindustrializing the
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:47.960]  country under agenda 21 Cloward and Piven was a plan by some sociologist
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:52.720]  adopted by the Democrats back in the 60s but it's a much older plan the Romans
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:56.360]  and others had it where you make people dependent you enslave them feudalist
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:01.640]  systems you keep them at a subsistence level as a mode of control it's like
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.360]  putting a prison out in the middle of West Texas if you try to escape you know
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:08.960]  good luck no chains are needed because there's desert for 300 miles in all
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.440]  direction actually have prisons in places like West Texas and Nevada where no
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:17.320]  chains are needed on the chain gangs because there's no where to go it's a
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:23.720]  hundred miles or more to any town in some cases 300 miles and that's what
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:26.080]  they're doing where you don't know how to farm you don't know how to ranch
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.960]  there's no culture the kids are taught two plus two equals five in the common
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.640]  core in the new math they are literally creating a group of people that can be
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:42.160]  remolded into their collective a stream and the big mega banks they want a
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:46.560]  relationship like that now coming up at the bottom of the hour will shift gears
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:50.520]  with our guests and get us take on some of the other news issues like neighbors
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:54.920]  call cops on man for washing car in his own driveway that's global zoning they
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:59.160]  got the city to pass saying you can't wash your car in your own yard that
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:03.200]  that's the essence of tyranny or you can't have a lemonade stand we're gonna
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:06.920]  get William F. Jaspers take on that then we're gonna get to this story that's on
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:13.200]  drugsreport.com Pennsylvania's coerced into giving cheek swab at voluntary
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.640]  checkpoints but in some cases I don't even tell you it's voluntary remember
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.160]  up in Fort Worth a few weeks ago it made national news where the woman said
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:23.400]  they didn't even give her a chance she said you're gonna get it for a DNA
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:28.960]  database federally funded and speaking of globalism and deindustrialization and
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:35.520]  how these trade deals work and operate corporate socialism general motor says
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:40.640]  no way it'll pay back 10 billion well general motors got 20 something billion
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:45.120]  but 10 billion from one of the payments is due they use the money on record to
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:49.600]  move to Brazil China and Eastern Europe so so under globalism you don't just pay
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.600]  10 billion to select corporations so they can give part of it to the unions or
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:56.800]  whatever at least that would go back into the economy but it's bad enough
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:59.960]  socialism but at least it's like inflation where the money goes to the
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:05.680]  people now under under QE it goes to the elite and not to the people and it's the
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:10.360]  same thing here where you pay to have your job moved with authoritarian China
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:15.400]  where their wages in many areas are going down not up and they have cities
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:20.320]  for the rich communist that's an oxymoron but that's what it is and then they
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:23.800]  have the cities for all the poor where you live in coffin size apartments have
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:28.640]  forced abortions and are drugged with suicide nets around the Apple Foxcom
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:35.080]  factories but that's okay because Al Gore's on the board and it's liberal when
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.200]  Obama drops bombs are back to Al Qaeda it's liberal but I have mainstream news
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:44.040]  articles we'll get to later where they admit oh US getting closer to extremist
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:48.360]  they put the extremist in in the Middle East they've been protecting them now
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:52.000]  they know we know about it so they're like oh maybe we'll be friends with Al
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:58.800]  Qaeda now Homeland Security is for the Tea Party now I wanted to get William F
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:05.320]  Jasper senior editor at the New American magazine on to talk about this new
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.560]  partnership with Asia just like NAFTA and GATT they have the Atlantic trade
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.720]  partnership but they have this Trans Pacific partnership that almost all of
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:19.120]  its secret parts of it have been released by moles via WikiLeaks and it's
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.920]  exactly what we expected to see like we saw in the Banff Canada documents that
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:26.680]  were released in 2007 that are in my film in-game where you have the top
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.680]  hundred corporations are so there and the leaders of all the executive branches
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:34.840]  there and a bunch of lawyers and the governments literally take orders there
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:39.240]  and they write it up where power is transferred to these corporate boards
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:45.040]  and that's what globalism is is private corporations exempting themselves from
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:54.400]  the regulations the taxes lobbying for hard taxes on their competition and then
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:59.120]  consolidating the economy in fact we'll put his article up on screen for TV
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.160]  viewers if you want to go check it out they also produced a video that we link
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:08.480]  to on info wars.com yesterday where William F Jasper breaks it down great
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:14.440]  video great article to send out to folks Trans Pacific partnership TPP bigger
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.600]  and more dangerous than Obamacare and I agree with him and even the Huffington
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:25.760]  Post said it's authoritarianism by Obama because it's a total power grab on
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:32.760]  free speech on markets on taxes on every front and there's not even any news
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:37.120]  coverage except for Ron Paul talks about it we talk about it William F Jasper
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.960]  talks about it Roger Port talks about it world that daily talks about it the
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.000]  libertarian constitutional media talks about it but no one else is discussing
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.960]  it until the last few weeks finally we're getting some coverage because man I
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:54.280]  tell you you talk about hidden in plain view and sneaking it through on us now
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:58.960]  let me tell you who William F Jasper is as he joins us he's a graduate university
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.400]  of Idaho and joined the staff at the John Burt society in 1976 as a researcher
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.240]  and current senior editor of the new American and again his parents back in
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.360]  the 70s were getting into the anti-new order movement and we're anti-Vietnam
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:17.800]  war and he's like man that's like Tommy or something to kind of boil down what
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:21.320]  he said before an hour interview then he went and researched as a smart you know
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:25.160]  graduate student everything they were saying and found it was true and said
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:29.280]  well I better join the fight against it and so that's his story and he's an
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.440]  author filmmaker he's the author of United Nations Exposed global tyranny
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.680]  step-by-step the United Nations the emerging New World Order and he joins
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.160]  us to break down the de facto world corporate government first time I learned
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:47.760]  about us in 21 in 1992 from William F Jasper first time I learned about the UN
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:53.080]  and these biospheres William F Jasper and so he joins us now to talk about am I
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:58.040]  wrong in saying William the mother of all globalist power grabs so far this
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:04.680]  trans partnership with with Asia well you know there's so many of them when
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:09.520]  you look at the TPP Alex it's a subset of the World Trade Organization so I guess
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:14.000]  you could say that the World Trade Organization is the mother itself is the
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.040]  mother and of course it is is really a progeny of the United Nations so the
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:23.480]  United Nations ends up really being the mother of all power grabs and all of
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:28.400]  these things the IMF the World Bank World Trade Organization flow from it but
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:33.960]  the TPP the Trans-Pacific Partnership which as you pointed out Americans are
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:37.840]  just learning about now we've been writing about it and talking about it
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:44.320]  for the last couple of years but it has now reached the point where President
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:49.280]  Obama in his State of the Union address earlier this year said that he wanted it
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:54.640]  passed by the end of the year and that's what they were pushing for so we've had a
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:58.800]  victory of sorts in that it looks like they're not gonna be able to even sneak
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:04.480]  it through during a Christmas sneak attack which is when many really bad
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:09.120]  use of legislation have gone through however they may try by the end of the
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:14.840]  year to push through trade promotion authority and people who remember the
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:21.720]  NAFTA fight the CAFTA fight all of the other at the SPP security prosperity
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:26.360]  track you're right that's the fast track they want to have it pushed through
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:31.080]  Congress without debate without any amendments without any kind of
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:37.880]  conditions and that's how a lot of the congressmen who are really trying to be
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:42.640]  weasley on this will say well I voted for the fast track but I voted I'm against
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:50.960]  the against the trade agreement well if they push through the fast track it
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:56.960]  almost then becomes a sure thing that it's going to be eventually passed that's
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:00.680]  right and when I say the mother of all obviously David Rockefeller and people
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:04.280]  are in Cecil Rhodes are the mother of it all but when I see what's in these
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.400]  documents and and that's only one part of the larger plan it's the
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.800]  biggest grab I've seen and the biggest transfer directly to private corporate
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:21.200]  interest towards corporate global government right this is this is an
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:25.680]  incredible grab for power an unconstitutional transfer of power if
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:32.960]  if we allow this to go through of international and international multinational
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:39.080]  corporate takeover of government functions legislative executive and
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:44.480]  judicial at the federal state and local levels and it let me tell you it will
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:48.880]  affect all of those as we are seeing these previous trade agreements NAFTA
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:55.440]  CAFTA dozens of these agreements that have gone through in one of my I did a
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:59.920]  series of video commentaries you referred to one of them there which are
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.560]  going to be coming out on the TPP all week and next week breaking down
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:11.320]  different parts of them but you'll recall that when we were fighting NAFTA
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:19.000]  here there's almost 30 years ago they we were saying hey this is going to be a
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.200]  transfer power it's an attack on our sovereignty we are going to be having
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:32.080]  international legal tribunals courts deciding on American law on state law on
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:37.680]  our national law on our local laws and we were laughed at we were scorned all
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:42.600]  of the people Republicans and Democrats this is a bipartisan treason Al Gore
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:46.920]  made all his jokes the bushes made jokes it was all very funny oh this is all
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:51.160]  about prosperity this is about trade about opening up new jobs etc it has
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:54.880]  nothing to do with anything that's going to sacrifice any of our sovereignty
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:05.520]  ten years later in 1992 when the excuse me ten years after after it passed then
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:12.040]  we had cases brought against American companies and and they were being
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:17.400]  decided by NAFTA courts in fact NAFTA courts were overriding American courts
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:20.640]  that's right and now we're going to break and now look at how we've been
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:24.960]  deindustrialized because the globalist could just put regulations on us that
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:28.840]  China wasn't following and then transfer of the jobs William F. Jaspers our
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:33.120]  guest we're gonna come back to him and I haven't gotten to the big issue yet the
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:37.680]  big enchilada in this whole deal is remember this agreement has been
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.960]  negotiated for years it's totally secret and Obama will not release it to
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:47.000]  anybody what's in it so understand that it's not just a power grab we don't get
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.800]  to know about it so we're gonna get William F. Jasper the expert on this to
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:53.720]  break it down we'll also tell you how to go to the new American magazine online

[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:42.200]  Jasper this is a short segment long segment coming up but I wanted to you
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:46.720]  know get into this with you it's the secretness of it it's not just the power
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:51.640]  transfer talk about that I mean we had to get wiki leaks to leak just one little
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:56.360]  part of the agreement and it was a draconian power grab the likes of which
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:02.080]  I've never seen well that Alex this is the the most disturbing and should be
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.920]  the most infuriating part of the whole process that we see going on here with
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:15.440]  the TPP it's a replay of what we've seen at past trade agreements but this has
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:20.480]  been even worse the secrecy from our transparent president remember he
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.000]  promised over and over again we were good this was going to be the
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.120]  administration of transparency this has been conducted in total secrecy even
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:32.040]  your elected representatives the American people forget that they're not
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:35.640]  going to release the text this has been going on for a couple of years they have
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:39.680]  these negotiation meetings going on with hundreds of representatives of
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:44.520]  corporate America and foreign corporations big labor unions NGOs the
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:49.000]  big Sierra Club now natural resources defense counsel all of the big
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:56.560]  approved representatives so these are the NGOs who are going to go along with
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:03.280]  all of this and so they are given the text consider this senators and
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:09.320]  congressman people we elect to represent us have requested copies of the
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:14.880]  text and they're told no you and your staff cannot look at them however if
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:19.280]  you are you cannot have them however we'll let you come over here and look
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:23.760]  at them but you can't take any notes it can't make any copies however
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.200]  representatives of corporations and labor unions they're given us a cure
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:34.280]  website and a passcode they can come log on and go through the the documents at
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:38.480]  any time this is outrageous it shouldn't be tolerated here in our country and
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.360]  when you see when your congressman says yes he's very upset about this well then
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.800]  ask them what are you doing about this it's it's one thing for them just to
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:53.280]  give lip service and and issue utterances that kind of give them cover
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:57.320]  so that they can show the folks about back home that they're doing something
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:02.800]  about it but there really aren't if they don't force this out into the open they
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:08.720]  need to subpoena those things are here's here's where the real breakdown is and
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:13.880]  this is with the the media of course this is no surprise to you Alex but we're
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.760]  seeing the same thing here that we did during NAFTA CAFTA and all the WTO battle
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:25.000]  all of these things the major media have jumped on board with this they'll offer
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:31.560]  some occasional criticism of the process or of the actual product but overall
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:36.520]  they give over complete support to it and or they just simply cover it up they
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:40.680]  don't report on it and this is true with most of the so-called conservative talk
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:49.280]  radio if they're not outright in support of the so-called trade agreements they
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:56.480]  simply ignore it and allow it to pass on a pose so right now we can get into some
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.200]  of the actual details that they're not telling us about one of the things that

[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:11.800]  pay increase we're not like NPR and some years getting 400 plus million
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:16.160]  sometimes more of taxpayer money sometimes as low as 200 million and then
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:18.960]  they're still running around begging for money all day when it's literally
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:23.760]  written underwritten by David Rockefeller pushing anti-family anti-liberty

[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.920]  want to absorb the tea party that comes out of the JBS and the new American and

[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:54.920]  and agenda 21 by Rosa Corey who used to be a mainline liberal and found out it
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:58.960]  was all true she was in state government in zoning and this is the best
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:03.320]  little booklet I think to wake people up it's available at info war store calm
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:08.080]  and then tragedy and hope that's I don't know 1100 pages or so that I see on
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:14.080]  William F. Jasper's bookshelf on Skype you're watching us on TV where the
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:18.000]  Georgetown political science professor Bill Clinton's mentor who he thanked in
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.200]  a state of the Union admits they control liberalism can fake
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:27.240]  conservatism fascism and the trilateral Commission and all of it is meant to
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:31.440]  bring in world corporate government and that it's only meant to look like
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:35.560]  there's the illusion of choice in politics I'm paraphrasing quotes this
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:39.760]  book and I've actually read almost the whole thing when I say that I probably
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:43.400]  read 800 pages of it over the years because I mean I skip over some of the
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:48.120]  more little factoid inside baseball stuff but I've read Cecil Rhodes's
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:53.240]  writings I mean I've read H.G. Wells writings from them the White House
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:56.560]  science art I'm not putting stuff in the water to sterilize you had written in
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:01.720]  74 that's John P. Holdren's eco science I mean I've got that over there on the
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:06.200]  bookshelf I mean I know what they've really said okay this isn't a game so I
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:11.760]  wanted to William F. Jasper to get into what's in the trans-specific partnership
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:18.360]  TPP how we beat it and then how it nexuses in to agenda 21 and all the
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:22.720]  things that are happening right now and so please segue into what's at the
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:26.520]  center of the spider web how things are going I mean I know that's a whole
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:30.400]  waterfront I'll remind you of the questions but more on TPP how do we
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:34.800]  beat that battle how does that web tie back to the center what's at the center
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:41.120]  what's the end game how's the fight going William F. Jasper well Alex first of
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:50.960]  all the TPP we have to realize as bad as it is is just a stepping stone and we
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:57.400]  have that in that in that same phrase stepping stone a transition by one of
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:02.720]  the architects of it C. Fred Bergstein C. Fred Bergstein is one of the big men in
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:08.480]  the council on foreign relations who is the chief brain in the brain trust known
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:14.120]  as the Peterson Institute for international economics and he said in a
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:19.480]  essay which I quote in a couple of my articles that the TPP the trans-specific
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.720]  partnership which now includes 12 countries we can run through the list of
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:31.920]  the countries if you want but it is just a stepping stone to the FTA AP the
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:37.680]  free trade area of the Asia Pacific which will include dozens of countries all
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:45.200]  around the Pacific Rim so again it's important to remember that even what we
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.280]  have learned as bad and as frightening as it is and as it should be to to
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:54.120]  Americans who treasure freedom it's just the tip of the iceberg it is a
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:39:00.040]  process they intend for it to keep evolving and if you read the literature
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:03.960]  regularly of the Peterson Institute of the council on foreign relations the
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:11.040]  Brookings Institution you see that they are plan on having this continually
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:16.360]  evolve with increasing structures of governance governance is a big is a big
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:22.840]  thing for them global governance and that is just kind of a euphemistic way of
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:28.560]  saying global government world government and they they say this quite
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:33.000]  openly in some of their publications but so they're talking about transferring
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:40.120]  economic power and global political power legislative executive and judicial to
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:47.080]  global institutions eventually all to the United Nations the World Trade
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:50.480]  Organization plays a very important transition role in all of this
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:55.480]  overseeing trade but as we pointed out and as you were hitting that there the
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:02.280]  this so-called trade agreement deals as the US trade representative office even
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:07.120]  admits on its website only deals about 20% of the whole agreement deals with
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:12.440]  trade issues so if it's a trade agreement what are all the other issues
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:17.920]  that it's that it's dealing dealing with well it goes on on their website says
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.600]  that it's deals with I'll just read you some of the things there it deals with
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:29.080]  customs deals with intellectual trade it deals with taxation it goes through a
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.960]  whole whole list of things they deal with virtually everything that is
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:38.480]  outside of trade in that state local and federal law it is governance with
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:44.400]  NATO as the UN army so what's at the center of the spider and what is their
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:51.120]  endgame if they get planetary rule well power corrupts absolute power corrupts
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:55.000]  absolutely and when you have people who are already absolutely corrupt and they
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:02.160]  get absolute power you know the the endgame is is really absolute corruption
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:07.840]  and as professor RJ Rommel said in his death by government is that power
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:16.680]  corrupts and power and power kills so once you have total control in government
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:20.900]  in this case a world government we could expect nothing else except for
[02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:26.240]  tyranny on a global scale and with that genocide which we've always seen
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:30.600]  whenever you have total absolute government on a global scale and so this
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:34.560]  is a very dangerous thing people will think we're exaggerating when we say
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:39.560]  that but look our founding fathers recognize that they said jar guard with
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:47.960]  jealous with jealousy the the public safety and the public liberty so we're
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:51.600]  supposed to be jealous about these things we're supposed to be prudent and
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:58.200]  recognize whenever government is taking steps to expand its power that we better
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:02.920]  slam it back down if we're going to remain the masters instead of the slaves
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:07.680]  or the servants so this is a very dangerous thing and whenever they
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:12.400]  operate in secrecy they do not want us to know what they're doing that is what
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:17.200]  you call a clue that this is not something that is going to be sure I
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:20.480]  mean you guys are trailblazers who pointed out the Vietnam War was meant
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:24.760]  to create artificial dissension bankrupt the country you guys got attacked by
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.000]  the left and the right and demonized you know when your parents were part of the
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.960]  John Burt society because you were so effective and so on target and I've
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:37.080]  noticed the John Burt society since then has been an ultra conservative about
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:41.480]  the info you cover and I'm not criticizing your trailblazers but now you
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:45.320]  guys are always on the cutting edge of exposing the new attack but but very
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:50.960]  calmly very focused but at the same time you know almost almost not even
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:55.720]  hammering it as bad as it is because the system came after you back when they
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:01.120]  had media superiority and dominance they don't have media superiority and
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:06.080]  dominance anymore they're losing it and I wanted to ask you where do you think
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:09.680]  the world is today because here's an example on drudgereport.com he's
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:14.120]  coming up in about 20 minutes claiming the man who took on Obama and won with
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:19.720]  the NSA stunning revelations dirty tricks NSA sent out emails that he never
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:25.160]  wrote guys we print me that this is the kind of stuff they do to me I get calls
[02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:28.720]  and then we track it back to government sources and corporate people send out
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:33.400]  threatening emails faxes attacks say things I never said edit what I say
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:40.160]  lie about what I say but the thing is it doesn't work anymore when they would
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:45.200]  attack me like this 10 years ago it would hurt me now even the unintellectual
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:50.400]  and uninformed go wait if the system is attacking you you must be good so what
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.080]  I'm saying is like I told Politico a few years ago I said if you want to hurt
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:58.800]  Rand Paul start agreeing with him and endorsing him that will destroy him
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.560]  because people aren't sophisticated enough that have just woken up they're
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:05.960]  awake but not to exactly what's happening as cocky wake up you're half
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:09.120]  asleep you're figuring out what's going on I said the only to destroy us will be
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:13.280]  to endorse us but you don't do that because you're so arrogant and so what
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:18.160]  I'm saying here is you guys were right you were right about it all and then
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:21.280]  you're almost not you but some other folks almost apologetic when you break
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:26.560]  down the diabolic nature of this when you guys were always aware of it so so
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:31.080]  what is the state of the world and and and what is the center of this and you
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:35.080]  said corrupts absolutely well sure it's forced world population reduction but
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:39.880]  where do you know fighting these guys for several decades and standing on the
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:43.160]  shoulders of folks have been fighting it you know really the first to analyze the
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:49.280]  enemy attack profile along with Cleon scowls and others what really William F
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:52.640]  Jasper is the editor of that magazine what do you really think about the fight
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:59.720]  what do you really think is at the bottom of the rat hole well in reference
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:06.560]  to the TPP it's very clear that one of the things that came out in the wiki
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:11.640]  leaks thing is that they're trying to shut down all independent media such as
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:18.280]  yourself such as such as our thing by implementing so pa and act under
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:25.880]  different names so pa the stop online piracy act act of the whatever one that
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:32.880]  was the both of those were aimed at legislation these were legislation in
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:40.920]  Congress to shut down the internet and to shut down independent media and
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:48.040]  thanks to an outpouring of citizen effort that legislation and others like it
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:53.400]  was defeated in in Congress and then Aaron Schwartz got hung right and so now
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:57.280]  they're trying to implement it in this trade agreement sneaking it in and
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:01.720]  that's just one example of many of the different things that they're gonna try
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:05.720]  to push through here and they are going to have unfortunately at this point
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:10.720]  lots of liberal Democrats and so-called conservative Republicans hopping on
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.000]  board because as they've done in the past they've been able to convince enough
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.240]  people that hey this is good for trade it's gonna be good for our economy
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:24.480]  they're gonna have a harder time doing it this time you know that's a good point
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:27.760]  though they couldn't get it done at the national level so they just go to this
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:33.120]  secret global level Congress can't see it I mean this is espionage this is a
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:36.760]  far-and-takeover instead of just criticizing it I think we start talking
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:43.720]  about treason trials well it is getting to that point I mean it is here here
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:51.280]  they are dismantling our constitutional system now before we went to the break I
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:57.040]  was going to go to a point that's really important about the judicial fiat that
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:05.600]  they're trying to give to the WTO and to the regional globalist courts back when
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:12.160]  when NAFTA was passed and we we said this was an attack on sovereignty you know
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.360]  we were ridiculed as I said however then after the lawsuits came down and the
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:22.240]  courts started ruling against us very interesting secretary of state our
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:26.760]  current secretary of state John Kerry was then a senator from Massachusetts and
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:33.200]  he started getting pummeled by constituents saying hey what's going on
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:39.080]  with this this this court is overruling our Massachusetts state court and here's
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:44.640]  what he said he said well back when we debated NAFTA nobody was saying anything
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:51.440]  about chapter 13 that was the chapter that dealt with with these regional
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:55.600]  tribunals he said nobody talked about that nobody said anything about the
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:02.840]  possibility of of losing our our sovereignty well that was a lie he we
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:06.120]  had said that a lot of things about it we'd written about that consulate we'd
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:10.680]  peppered him with that well Ross Perot did that too he said listen you're gonna
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:15.640]  have foreign bodies foreign tribunals railing on American trade deals and
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:21.480]  representative Abner Miktha said the same thing he said if we had known back
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:25.200]  when NAFTA was being debated that something like this could happen
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:30.120]  nobody in Congress would have voted for it well again this is after the fact
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:35.080]  trying to cover themselves they knew they had been apprised of this it was
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:40.240]  actually in the writing they could tell we we pointed it out it's in chapter 13
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:44.960]  read it now all of a sudden they pretend like well gee we never saw exactly so
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:50.000]  now they just keep it secret the next phase of it but I don't know how even if
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.960]  they ram this through and have people sign on to it at the executive level
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:56.960]  well that's my next issue what do you make of Obama and I know he's a puppet
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.820]  but he's having a precedent he really for all intents and purposes on open
[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:06.520]  borders on legalizing people on military putting NATO over our military over
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.720]  selectively enforcing 30-plus areas of Obamacare on so many fronts on guns
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:16.640]  he's acting as a dictator and saying that what do we do about that because now
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:20.600]  the president's being set for the executive to be dictatorial well
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:27.920]  unfortunately Obama's push in all of these areas and all of you is very
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:32.200]  frightening executive orders I mean anytime in a president issues executive
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.360]  orders and this is one of the first things when I first came into the
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:39.480]  movement I had never heard about before was really executive orders and I
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:45.080]  didn't realize the whole unconstitutional nature of the executive
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:50.360]  branch issuing executive orders like they've been doing for decades now
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:56.840]  president Obama has has taken this to a whole new level and unfortunately a very
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:02.440]  dangerous level but he could not have accomplished what he has done nobody
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:07.240]  would have stood for all of his executive orders that he's issued so far if
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:12.240]  if he had already not had the ground laid for him by exactly they've laid the
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:16.400]  foundation now he's building the house and now whoever moves in after him is
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:20.920]  going to be even worse I mean this year and here's the problem that we have is
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:27.520]  that too many Republicans say nothing and object very little if at all when a
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:32.920]  president Bush issues a Republican issues these executive orders similar
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:38.800]  executive orders and then they go all crazy when Obama does the Democrats do
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:45.000]  the same thing those who were just apoplectic over George Bush's executive
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.920]  orders have been very bright that's right it's total partisan gangster
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:53.920]  politics instead of being principled and living in reality but I think that's
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:57.520]  starting to change final segment with William F. Jasper straight ahead then

[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:40.520]  corporations that work with the globalist Canadian River artificially
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:44.280]  sweetened researchers find elevated levels of sugar substitute compounds in

[02:54:54.880 --> 02:55:00.720]  next hour than Larry Klayman with breaking news is coming on you know it's
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:07.040]  not just that my quote smartphone my spy phone has gone crazy before I've had it
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:11.080]  hacked before with someone in there typing and sending people emails in
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:15.040]  front of me and I've had to get rid of the phone multiple times and then it
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.080]  takes the government a while to dial into the new one and jack it and mess with
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:23.400]  it this happened to Klayman we'll talk to him about it this is what it's like
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.800]  when you deal with these globalist criminals this is living in the real
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:31.560]  world and it just shows how they had targeted the Associated Press and
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:35.160]  conservative and libertarian groups William F. Jasper isn't the biggest
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:38.840]  reason to impeach Obama and the Attorney General and and to start having
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:45.440]  arrest is that they use the IRS to target pro-life groups I mean I mean they
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:50.200]  this is oppression like what Hitler did to the Jews and people and the lead up
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:54.760]  to arresting them there isn't much more they can do after this and then they're
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:58.440]  domestically gearing up with Homeland Security for quote the you know the
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:04.080]  the patriot threat what do you see coming in the future of this fight well
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:08.200]  the IRS is a big part of it but then of course and I'm sure you've reported on
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:13.960]  it as well it has gone beyond that the president has issued assassination
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:19.840]  orders and has carried them out with drone attacks on American citizens on
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:24.440]  foreign citizens and this is happening on a regular basis just happened last
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:35.840]  week so that is one of the most really outrageous acts that he is that he has
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:43.240]  been carrying out is actually making Americans used to accepting that the
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:49.120]  president can name enemies and then use our military and police assets to have
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:56.160]  them killed without any judicial proceedings and no due process that is a
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:05.560]  very frightening development and that's gone further again then George Bush was
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:12.560]  able to go with his executive orders so and that is a very definitely an
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:16.600]  impeachable area for him impeachable offenses and their multiple offenses and
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:23.120]  so so we have some of the the foreign organizations and human rights groups
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:31.480]  that are calling for him to be prosecuted for human rights violations but
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:36.520]  unfortunately we haven't had many of the the liberals who were all over George
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:44.120]  Bush for all of his and rightfully so for all of his warmongering and criminal
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:51.080]  acts in Iraq Afghanistan etc. nothing of the same response from the liberals
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:55.760]  there the same as you probably noticed just recently when the Obama
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:59.840]  administration had announced that hey we're gonna stay in Afghanistan for
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:05.960]  another 10 years they just keep lying we promised 2012 we promised 2014 now it's
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:09.080]  another 10 years and they always intended to stay I mean I've got to say
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:12.520]  this though the so-called mainline liberals are the vanguard of the
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.920]  authoritarian takeover cloward and piven mainline conservatives are good
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:21.040]  folks are just ignorant but it's only been the libertarian constitutional
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:27.400]  patriot Ron Paul William F. Jasper type wing you know McManus wing that has told
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:31.360]  the truth and been real and so when we come back briefly in a final five

[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:26.920]  three minutes left or so now a minute on China and its role in the new world order
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:30.120]  and what you really think is going on and then two or three minutes on that
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:34.120]  question what do we do as people that aren't sellouts that know what's
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:37.240]  happening we're not the only ones that know what's going on most people join
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:41.680]  with Soran they join with the dark side so how does China play in and then what
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:47.720]  do we do as the real leadership that did accurately analyze this I think we
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:51.640]  should be a little more not arrogant but assertive about the fact that we know
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:58.240]  what we're talking about well China is a big part of what we see happening in
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:03.120]  the whole area that falls under the label of convergence and you'll have to
[03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:07.960]  have me back on sometime just to talk about convergence convergence is the
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:15.040]  planned operation incremental merging of the United States and other what used
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:19.560]  to be called the free world the West with Russia China and the rest of the
[03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:24.640]  communist world and you may recall that back when the Reese committee back in
[03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:30.240]  the 1950s in Congress investigated the tax exempt foundations rockfeller
[03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:35.960]  Ford foundations Carnegie foundations because they were promoting left-wing
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:42.240]  socialist and communist programs that the chief investigator Norman Dodd went
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:47.160]  to the Ford Foundation and he had one of those moments that you see on movies
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:54.360]  where the bad guy just can't resist that shortling to the hero about what
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:58.080]  they what they plan to do and how you can't do anything about it he Rowan
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:03:01.360]  Gay through a member of the council on foreign relations head of the Ford
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:06.120]  Foundation told this congressional investigator Norman Dodd we are
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:10.440]  operating under instructions to so change the fabric of the United States
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:14.720]  that it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union and at that time that
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:19.560]  included of course communist China and how is that going to be done well it was
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:23.800]  going to be done by changing the economics and political structure of the
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:29.920]  United States transferring all of our economic industrial base to China to
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:33.480]  Russia and to other countries so that and that's what they've done I'll get
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:37.040]  you on in the new year guys book him in the first or second week into a whole
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:41.360]  hour on convergence and to go over those committees and those documents this is
[03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:46.160]  on record in the next minute and a half what do we do and the listeners do that
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:50.880]  are informed because we really do have the answers to this what do we do well
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:54.440]  first of all we expose them as which is what you are doing what we're doing at
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:58.800]  the at the new American first let people know what they should be already
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:02.800]  aware of but then made mainstream media is not telling them so yeah we have to
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:06.280]  get this out to all of our friends and neighbors and one of the ways to do this
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:11.160]  is to go to the new American calm and right there on our on the top of our
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:18.400]  menu bar of our website you will see a a menu item called voting index and we
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:23.920]  put this out quarterly and it shows all the votes of members of the House of
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:28.800]  Representatives and Senate on on all the key issues that such as we're talking
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:33.640]  about here so that people will actually be able to know how their congressman
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:37.720]  their senator is voting not rely on what they what they are telling them at
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:43.840]  election time this is a critical year 2014 is critical that's what drudges said

[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:31.440]  remember interviewing him back in the mid 90s right to 2000 then when Bush got
[03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:36.160]  in he criticized ensued over unconstitutional activities there and
[03:08:36.160 --> 03:08:41.840]  now he has really turned up to heat with Obama because it's just the orgy of
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:48.120]  Constitution violations has has become dictator level and even mainline news is
[03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:51.960]  having to admit that so he's a real trailblazer and I'm very thankful that
[03:08:51.960 --> 03:08:57.880]  he was able to give us 10 minutes today he joins us live here's the headline
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:04.360]  CNN judge NSA domestic phone data mining unconstitutional who brought the case
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:10.560]  who want it when everybody else has been failing Larry claiming and then if you
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:14.760]  continue Politico says Larry claiming crows on NSA when we hit the mother
[03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:19.160]  load I'm glad he's proud of defending the Republic and then a stunning
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:23.600]  revelation from man who sued NSA Dr. Corsi writes about it and we also
[03:09:23.600 --> 03:09:28.440]  learned that they sent out emails that he didn't actually send out to let him
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:33.000]  know they were watching him that's the good old boys at the national security
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:38.080]  agency that we know or spying on the Tea Party the Associated Press pro-life
[03:09:38.080 --> 03:09:42.040]  groups giving the data to the Justice Department and the DEA and others to
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:46.920]  harass the Liberty Movement those of us that aren't authoritarians we don't like

[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:55.200]  under that horrible tyranny like North Korea we want to live in America and
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:59.160]  we're not terrorists and we're not the bad guys for being right about the NSA
[03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:06.280]  spying so joining us is Larry claiming to break down his stunning victory in the
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:10.840]  federal court please tell us about the case the ruling what happened the
[03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:14.880]  harassment you've been under and where this is going Larry thank you Alex thank
[03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:20.320]  you for those kind words hello Patriot you bet we'll break it down yeah let me
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:25.120]  tell you about the case just within a day or so when soden made his revelation
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:30.160]  we filed two class action lawsuits I'm a plaintiff I made myself a guinea pig put
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:34.400]  myself on the chopping block as both lawyer and plaintiff with our client
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:38.320]  Charlie Strange who you know about I think he's out of the show who is the
[03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:44.160]  father of Michael Strange an NSA not coincidentally cryptologist Larry your
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:52.720]  phone's a little low speak up for me thank you the Navy SEAL Team 6 and Michael
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:57.440]  Strange you know died in very suspicious circumstances and correctional
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:02.600]  investigation underway Charlie has been very critical the NSA of the Obama
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:07.400]  administration and military so we brought lawsuits and a minute we brought
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:11.240]  these lawsuits against Verizon and all the other cell phone companies and the
[03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:17.160]  internet providers like Google and Yahoo you name it we started to receive these
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:21.680]  text messages that we never sent and you know we're in fact harassing and it was
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:26.240]  clear that the NSA and the government Obama administration was trying to scare
[03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:31.280]  us from going forward but that being said and that's what Jerome Corsi my
[03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:36.560]  friend the client wrote about it will be daling we went forward with the case
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:40.640]  we filed motions for preliminary injunction we argued them in front of
[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:45.560]  the court on November 18th you can see the transcript and all the pleadings
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:51.600]  that freedom watch USA dot org freedom watch USA dot org and we told the judge
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:56.120]  that our government has broken away from the people that it no longer
[03:11:56.120 --> 03:12:00.320]  represents us that the executive and legislative branches of government have
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:04.440]  become tyrannical under Obama and frankly under the Republicans as well
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:07.960]  because they've gone along with this outrage this is the biggest violation of
[03:12:07.960 --> 03:12:11.520]  constitutional rights in American history our founding fathers would be
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:15.760]  turning in the graves to see this and that he was the last hope of the American
[03:12:15.760 --> 03:12:21.240]  people to step in to stop this outrage to stop this criminal violation of law and
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:24.880]  the judge obviously accepted our argument when we take our hat off to him
[03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:28.320]  there aren't many judges in this country Alex that would have done what he did
[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:31.440]  because most of them play it safe politically because they want to get a
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:35.600]  higher appointment well let's give you some brief to the hero sure let's give
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:38.240]  you some brief credit then when you get back into what happened when the ruling
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:42.320]  came down where it goes from here and the harassment you went under but I read
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:45.640]  your suit or looked over it and then read your comments in the press and what
[03:12:45.640 --> 03:12:50.280]  the judge said clearly you spelled out the truth these other lawsuits are real
[03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:54.200]  mealy-mouthed and we want the judge to tell us if they think it's bad as you
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:59.920]  know in law we need to declare the facts and stand on the Constitution common
[03:12:59.920 --> 03:13:06.080]  law common sense and the moral high ground so I think that's why your suit
[03:13:06.080 --> 03:13:10.240]  was also successful the police go ahead well and you and I are a lot of like we
[03:13:10.240 --> 03:13:14.280]  tell it as it is right yes I mean we don't have time to start mincing words
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:18.800]  this country's headed down the drain and we live in a police state where no one
[03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:22.720]  can send an email a text message a telephone call without thinking that
[03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:26.640]  they're being surveyed and that has a coercive effect it inflates the
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:31.640]  American people and keeps us down so we can't criticize the ruling and that's
[03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:35.200]  what I told the judge and he obviously agreed with me and if people want to
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:40.560]  read that decision it's it's freedomwatchusa.org so Alex we don't
[03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:44.920]  have time here and if if there are more judges like this that will step in that
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:48.680]  will protect the American people from the Obama administration or whoever
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:53.000]  occupies the White House and Congress Democrats and Republicans we've seen
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:57.800]  people like Peter King running in interference for Obama unless that
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:14:01.240]  happens we're in a state of revolution the country's gonna explode I don't want
[03:14:01.240 --> 03:14:04.720]  to see that happen so I challenge the judge I challenge other judges to be
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:08.320]  courageous and protect the American people and I'm gonna do my part by
[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:13.680]  finally lost it by engaging in civil disobedience Gandhi style whatever it
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:17.240]  takes to save this country and you're doing your part and you're doing the
[03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:20.440]  country of great service because you talk clearly and we have to talk and
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:24.600]  you're taking action you just had a rally there in DC saying Obama needs to
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:29.840]  step down I mean now is the time and you know I've seen some of the so-called
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:35.240]  left like at the Guardian saying oh the gadfly Larry claiming you know took on
[03:14:35.240 --> 03:14:39.160]  the NSA hey you've got the courage you did it you're the one getting your
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:44.840]  emails broken into and then the left can't even say good job for all our
[03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:48.680]  rights they've got to make a sniveling joke the only reason I bring that up is
[03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:53.560]  that we have to come together as human beings as Americans and people and say
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:15:00.040]  come on this is spying beyond 1984 and we need to support everybody I've
[03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:03.640]  supported liberals that have been against the NSA spying it's time to come
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:07.120]  together tell me about what the judge said in the ruling where it goes from
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:10.000]  here and what happened to your emails well the judge first of all ordered that
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:14.320]  all of our metadata of Larry claiming that Charles Strange be destroyed and we
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:18.240]  want that same order for all of the American 300 million just had their
[03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:22.520]  homes broken into you know Richard Nixon he only broke into the Watergate office
[03:15:22.520 --> 03:15:27.400]  complex he had to resign Obama and his Republican and Democrat enablers broken
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:31.800]  at 300 homes so the judge that destroy all that data and he said you know I'll
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:36.160]  let's just go up on appeal government but if you don't tow the line and follow
[03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:40.880]  my order and my order is upheld and it comes back there's going to be held at
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:44.760]  pay and you're going to be sanctioned I'll tell you something we'll assist that
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:48.680]  because if they now they're unnoticed that what they're doing is criminal it's
[03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:52.600]  illegal the violation of our Constitution and if they continue to do
[03:15:52.600 --> 03:15:56.760]  this that we cash them doing it and our orders are upheld and we're confident
[03:15:56.760 --> 03:16:00.800]  they will be I will file a motion to have them held in criminal contempt and
[03:16:00.800 --> 03:16:04.320]  thrown in jail and whether the courts will do that's another question but if
[03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:07.640]  the courts don't do that then the American people are in the street because we
[03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:15.120]  can't live under under a George Orwell 1984 Atlas shrugged world that's not the
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:19.080]  United States that's the Soviet Union that's China that's not the United States
[03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:22.960]  as a top constitutional lawyer who's had probably more victories anybody I know
[03:16:22.960 --> 03:16:26.680]  against tyranny the last 20 plus years I followed you and had the honor to talk
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:30.440]  to you Larry and again if you just tuned in the man who just got a the only
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:34.460]  federal ruling out there against the NSA the only sanity in years Larry
[03:16:34.460 --> 03:16:38.760]  claiming joins us right now freedom watch USA.org I had him on a month ago
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:43.960]  saying join his organization donate this guy files real lawsuits for real
[03:16:43.960 --> 03:16:47.520]  results so people don't go there and donate which he's not asking you to do
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:51.560]  here on air I'm bringing it up you're crazy I mean Larry claiming it just
[03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:55.440]  continues to be the real deal and to really get the word across I need to
[03:16:55.440 --> 03:17:01.240]  ask you though you're looking at this where do you expect it to go now and
[03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:05.880]  talk about precedent as a constitutional lawyer because if we don't stop Obama
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:09.600]  acting like a dictator it sets a precedent if the NSA stuff comes out
[03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:13.720]  now and they don't get reversed it sets a precedent what's coming next that's
[03:17:13.720 --> 03:17:16.480]  what I'm concerned about can you explain to people this principle
[03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:21.240]  historically that it doesn't stay in one place things get better or worse and if
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:25.520]  we don't reverse it we're going to hell in a handbasket we've already go to
[03:17:25.520 --> 03:17:31.640]  hell in a handbasket we're hanging by a thread and it's time for people who are
[03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:36.560]  knowledgeable to take action and this one judge stepped forward but he's the only
[03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:39.600]  judge I've seen in recent years judge Royce Lambert was like that during the
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:43.880]  20 years he hasn't got one of my cases lately I pray that he will he's a great
[03:17:43.880 --> 03:17:48.600]  judge too he's a colleague of Leon but there aren't many like that and we
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:52.840]  really have to educate and we really have to show the American people what
[03:17:52.840 --> 03:17:56.200]  that issue and what's ironic you mentioned the left I've been getting more
[03:17:56.200 --> 03:17:59.640]  calls from the left in the last few days from the right and you know their
[03:17:59.640 --> 03:18:06.120]  two-faced behind our back they criticize us but to our face they're praising us
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:10.200]  because there's nobody on the left that is doing what I'm doing with freedom
[03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:14.640]  watch is doing and they appreciate that but they won't give us any credit so
[03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:18.920]  they have to take shot that if I can the Guardian or Politico or whatever and I'm
[03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:23.920]  used to that rolls off my back I could care less that the point is that we want
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:28.000]  results and I'm not equating myself with Jesus Christ
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:32.200]  hardly I'm not in his league obviously no but I'm holding you up with somebody
[03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:37.160]  that took action and won and I mean this is all of us having our rights robbed
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:41.360]  they've come in our houses they've come in our businesses what I'm saying is
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:46.160]  that you know they took shots of Jesus to right he was the son of God exactly I
[03:18:46.160 --> 03:18:51.440]  can take it and stick it and we're gonna do what we have to do and we're not
[03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:55.880]  gonna be deterred and I hope the judges will follow the lead of judge Leo
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:19:00.400]  because he is an American hero and you're an American hero and anybody who
[03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:03.440]  speaks clearly is an American hero and I don't care if you're right left or
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:07.480]  center we're all in it together anybody that challenges the attempt to chill
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:10.840]  political speech in the five minutes we've got left now you've got a go Larry
[03:19:10.840 --> 03:19:13.720]  claiming there'll be something you wish you would have added after you leave so
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:16.920]  you've got the floor tell us about your emails getting messed with according to
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:20.560]  course see if that's accurate I'm sure it is and then where all this goes and
[03:19:20.560 --> 03:19:25.600]  what we can do and other points about this case well we know Alex you know
[03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:29.280]  that when the government wants to get you to back off they send people to follow
[03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:34.520]  you home photograph your house to do whatever they can do to make calls you
[03:19:34.520 --> 03:19:38.200]  would click phone it I mean I've gone through that for decades this is just
[03:19:38.200 --> 03:19:42.400]  the latest the gambit by the government they sent text messages that I'd ever
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:48.120]  sent people that I'm close with that I work with and they did the same thing
[03:19:48.120 --> 03:19:51.520]  with regard to Charlie Strange getting him to believe that he was getting
[03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:55.440]  emails from his dead son and the poor guy breaks down in tears at the flight
[03:19:55.440 --> 03:20:00.600]  mention of Michael being killed they're cruel people they're evil and frankly
[03:20:00.600 --> 03:20:03.000]  they're criminals and they should be thrown into prison that's where they
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:07.320]  belong this guy clapper who lied in front of Congress it had been you or me
[03:20:07.320 --> 03:20:12.240]  we'd already be gone I mean they got to go after you know baseball pitchers and
[03:20:12.240 --> 03:20:16.800]  others for lying to Congress that this guy is subjugating the rights of the
[03:20:16.800 --> 03:20:23.280]  American people and slaving us with this guy clapper and the others at the NSA
[03:20:23.280 --> 03:20:27.320]  slaving us with more willing inside and he walks off that break yeah because
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:30.960]  establishment does high-fives and divides up the money in Washington they
[03:20:30.960 --> 03:20:33.440]  don't care if the American people get it but I don't want to glaze over that though
[03:20:33.440 --> 03:20:37.760]  the father of the dead Navy SEAL clearly a cover up there they're messing with him
[03:20:37.760 --> 03:20:41.840]  to give us this was that's incredible Larry no it is incredible we got the proof
[03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:45.560]  when we gave it to the court wow and we get we gave it to the court that's what
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:49.880]  they do Alex you know no I know yeah I thought to a national they were tapping
[03:20:49.880 --> 03:20:56.240]  our windows I brought somebody in to confirm that people were we're in front
[03:20:56.240 --> 03:21:00.440]  of our office and white a white guy's an aviator glasses in an African-American
[03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:04.520]  neighborhood following my people home you know this is what they do you can't
[03:21:04.520 --> 03:21:07.760]  be deterred you can't be scared of them if you walk down the street think the
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:11.960]  dog's gonna bite you he will bite you so yeah they don't do that to me anymore
[03:21:11.960 --> 03:21:14.240]  because something that happened many years ago I can't help it I go
[03:21:14.240 --> 03:21:17.880]  completely a no and that's what the American people are subjected to we live
[03:21:17.880 --> 03:21:23.880]  in a blue log type society it is little different in this regard and the former
[03:21:23.880 --> 03:21:29.080]  Soviet Union or China today and we can't tolerate that and a judge made
[03:21:29.080 --> 03:21:34.440]  reference to that this is a complete violation of the founding father's
[03:21:34.440 --> 03:21:39.160]  principles upon which this nation now well I know it will even prominent
[03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:42.160]  Democrats have been coming out saying clappers should be indicted because he
[03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:45.800]  clearly lied to Congress and said we don't grab any data of Americans it's just
[03:21:45.800 --> 03:21:50.960]  a total fraud Larry claiming let me ask you this specifically what do you expect
[03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:54.680]  now to happen in this court case do you think the rogue elements of the
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:59.960]  government that are stealing all our data illegally with our tax money do you
[03:21:59.960 --> 03:22:04.680]  think they'll start backing off because of this judge or will the judge you know
[03:22:04.680 --> 03:22:12.320]  have a kayak accident but you know the government will be the government and
[03:22:12.320 --> 03:22:16.760]  we've told we've asked the court to set up a very strong monitoring mechanism
[03:22:16.760 --> 03:22:20.600]  where we can take discovery I'll be filing for a security clearance the
[03:22:20.600 --> 03:22:24.560]  headline when I was a justice department project so we can get into
[03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:28.040]  discovery find out what's going on and hopefully we'll learn even more than
[03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:32.800]  what's done at this point but this is just the beginning of this case is
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:37.080]  going to trial now the judge found a likelihood of success the government
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:42.400]  can't get rid of it only if they do a Hail Mary and pellet court that's not
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:45.600]  going to happen briefly tell us about the case for those that don't know me
[03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:50.360]  what it encapsulate it the case is very simple it's a violation of the Fourth
[03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:55.240]  Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures the First Amendment were
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:22:59.360]  chilling free speech and rights of association because you think the
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:03.240]  government is watching you're not going to want to express yourself freely and
[03:23:03.240 --> 03:23:10.200]  do process because here to four use the legal phrase companies like Verizon and
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:13.160]  the government went in front of the fifth court the fire and intelligence
[03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:17.600]  surveillance court and we had no right to even know what was going on and that's
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:22.840]  why this judge you know an exercise is legitimate powers it's so important
[03:23:22.840 --> 03:23:26.880]  because he has checked the fifth court he's checked his fellow justice he had
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:34.000]  judges he's been extremely brave and yeah I've created nothing now well I talked
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:39.280]  to a national talk show host last week who didn't want to go public with it
[03:23:39.280 --> 03:23:43.000]  because you know it sounds crazy but now it's not because it's so mainstream he
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:47.520]  gets threatened but also the fake text the fake emails years ago when I would go
[03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:52.600]  cover Bilderberg or go cover a DNC or RNC event my wife would get phone calls
[03:23:52.600 --> 03:23:57.440]  but there'd be no number on the caller ID just no number and then they would you
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:02.280]  know women saying oh hi I'm calling for my boyfriend he got me pregnant though my
[03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:04.960]  wife said I know that's not true you've done this before a guy would come on and
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:08.800]  say you know you know hope your whole family dies you saw you walking the dog
[03:24:08.800 --> 03:24:13.800]  this morning and you and then you realize wow it's really the government or
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:18.680]  someone in our phone system because the numbers not showing up or you'll have
[03:24:18.680 --> 03:24:21.840]  family in the hospital they'll wait till something bad happens and they'll call
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:26.840]  up and say I hope your dad dies and it didn't get to me over the years so it
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:31.680]  hadn't happened in a while but but still unless you've experienced it people
[03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:35.920]  don't realize that's the final proof that evil is taken over the government
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:39.360]  Larry and I noticed you've gotten more stalwart and hardcore over the years as
[03:24:39.360 --> 03:24:43.760]  you've been persecuted because if you're not a coward this stuff only makes you
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:48.120]  mad I mean but I guess they want us to talk about it then and scare everybody
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:53.240]  what do you think the intimidation tactic is a guy's an aviator sunglasses
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:58.080]  to get people to be scared of the back off you remember Vince Foster when he
[03:24:58.080 --> 03:25:02.360]  died in Fort Marcy Park yes years ago during the Clinton administration and
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:06.960]  it was some people said it was suicide other people said he was murdered he was
[03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:12.000]  the boyfriend of Hillary Clinton and many people thought that Hillary put a
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  hit out on him because he was about ready to tell the truth about what they
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:18.640]  all were doing he was actually thought to be an ethical guy to pose another
[03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:23.200]  number of people in the White House well the people who were witnesses what
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:27.440]  happened to Fort Marcy Park found the body they were followed around Washington
[03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:32.560]  by FBI agents other agents scare them to keep them quiet and there are a lot of
[03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:36.200]  good people the FBI might have represented some of them but not those
[03:25:36.200 --> 03:25:40.520]  people that were following him around and this is a government tactic you know
[03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:46.000]  and it works where they fix the IRS where they do this or they do that and you
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:49.920]  know the American people have had enough the Popeye used to say enough is enough
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:54.680]  and enough is too much it's done it's over case closed government does not
[03:25:54.680 --> 03:25:57.920]  represent the people and that's why I've gotten hardened over the years because
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:02.160]  you know I believe in in a government that functions isn't on the back of the
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:06.560]  American people it isn't persecuting us to protect us from foreign entity leaves
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:11.160]  of the loan otherwise and it our government has become dominant of every
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:15.600]  aspect of our life you know in some states you can't even have somebody pet
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:20.640]  your dog or or brush him at a dog hotel unless they've got a license I mean it's
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:23.480]  ridiculous oh no they're now all over the country telling people they can't
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:26.760]  have lemonade stands you can't wash your car in your own yard you can't have a
[03:26:26.760 --> 03:26:32.480]  garden I mean this is a martial law a nanny state a six-year-old kisses another

[03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:44.440]  backyard they get kicked out of school I mean this government thank your kid or
