[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:40.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.680]  and gentlemen I was just ranting and raving before I even went on air here
[00:44.680 --> 00:50.840]  about the state of our world and the state of zombie ism that is now
[00:50.840 --> 00:55.440]  pollaxing much of the public where the public is even unable to tie their
[00:55.440 --> 01:00.060]  shoelaces or communicate with each other the language is being shrunken less and
[01:00.060 --> 01:06.240]  less words are being used even makes free media admits that the health of the
[01:06.240 --> 01:12.320]  population is degenerating very very quickly of a CBS article here study
[01:12.320 --> 01:18.640]  baby boomers health very poor getting worse deteriorating fast absolute total
[01:18.640 --> 01:25.560]  and complete insanity is where this society is going because we have become
[01:25.560 --> 01:32.880]  of a nation but also a planet of of industrialized jellyfish that watch
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.320]  television all day and do not live in the real world and just kind of shuffle
[01:37.320 --> 01:42.880]  around aimlessly pretty soon they'll probably have to mount everyone with
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.040]  artificial respirators because people will be too lazy to suck air into their
[01:48.040 --> 01:52.440]  lungs and of course I know that that's brainstem controlled and that that's
[01:52.440 --> 01:57.560]  supposedly automatic but I predict breathing will soon have become
[01:57.560 --> 02:03.800]  government assisted and it'll be a conspiracy theory that we were ever
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.400]  able to breathe on our own I'm serious I'm serious don't think the globalist
[02:09.400 --> 02:14.720]  won't release a virus to eat areas of the brainstem that control breathing
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.240]  respiration and then that's shell us little microchips to implant in that
[02:19.240 --> 02:26.560]  area of the brainstem of course it'll have back doors that then control us by
[02:26.560 --> 02:30.520]  the way I'm not even being satirical at this point because things have gotten so
[02:30.520 --> 02:37.520]  crazy that the wildest satire is now reality okay here's what we got going
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.440]  on today if you're listening to us on the radio well thank you for tuning in
[02:41.440 --> 02:47.200]  that's about 95% of our audience but there are prison planet dot TV viewers
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.080]  and there are folks that are gonna be watching this later on YouTube and
[02:52.080 --> 02:55.440]  hundreds of other video channels millions and millions a week to you'll
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.400]  notice last night and today there there's gonna be documents articles and
[02:59.400 --> 03:04.160]  our guests joining us via video but we're putting in new sound doors and new
[03:04.160 --> 03:10.720]  equipment and things in this studio so it's it's a bit disheveled and it should
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.760]  be done by tomorrow or so so you will not be tortured by pumpkin head quite
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.600]  literally a pumpkin headed creature all right I am gonna settle down because I
[03:20.600 --> 03:23.440]  was running around in circles yelling and screaming right before I went on
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.200]  there trying to get air back into my lungs I've been spending like three weeks
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.800]  just trying to get Paul Watson who changed his phone numbers his name on
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.480]  the phone list and I've see to be a manager we have a great career by the
[03:37.480 --> 03:41.400]  way that they just do incredible jobs but it's like little things like
[03:41.400 --> 03:47.560]  organization and stuff like that it it it it it it it it becomes an issue and I
[03:47.560 --> 03:50.320]  don't think we'll ever be in contact with Watson again in fact that's probably
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.760]  the end of Paul Watson never hear him again on the show never talk to him
[03:53.760 --> 03:56.840]  again I mean I have his number I talked to him but that'll be it you never never
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.680]  see Watson again it's all over and I'll have to communicate with Steve Watson
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.760]  here over the airwaves is the only way to get through to him that's kind of the
[04:06.760 --> 04:13.240]  modern society that's how people manage you you don't manage them and again the
[04:13.240 --> 04:20.200]  respiration will soon have to be well-governmentated that said I do have a
[04:20.200 --> 04:25.280]  lot of anger issues frustration issues that are of course quite evident and
[04:25.280 --> 04:29.960]  start your engines because we will officially launch the transmission out
[04:29.960 --> 04:35.720]  of the gates when we return after this quick break and it is a big Mac Daddy
[04:35.720 --> 04:43.560]  kahuna of a broadcast today you had better believe that this is going to be a
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.880]  radio show that you are not gonna want to miss you know it feels so much more
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.840]  intimate to not have the bright lights on in here or to have all the cameras on
[04:50.840 --> 04:56.040]  me feels like old radio I'm almost tempted to just pull the cameras out
[04:56.040 --> 05:02.240]  of here because it's so liberating Aaron full in here as the food police shut
[05:02.240 --> 05:06.600]  down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not
[05:06.600 --> 05:10.240]  just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for
[05:10.240 --> 05:13.880]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[05:13.880 --> 05:17.800]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[05:17.800 --> 05:20.920]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[05:20.920 --> 05:23.800]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[05:23.800 --> 05:27.040]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every

[08:33.200 --> 08:41.000]  joining us today as we blast out on the AM and FM dial simulcast on XM-166 and
[08:41.000 --> 08:48.040]  we have Max Kaiser joining us coming up in the second hour always a popular and
[08:48.040 --> 08:52.480]  informative guest so we have him on a couple times a month max Kaiser com of
[08:52.480 --> 08:55.760]  course this is website he's gonna be giving us his take on what's happening
[08:55.760 --> 09:01.880]  with the economy and I've got a whole parcel of nightly news reports that are
[09:01.880 --> 09:06.040]  just so important to air here on the radio really important information with
[09:06.040 --> 09:10.800]  Gary Johnson libertarian candidate we've got a report from the NSA we have an
[09:10.800 --> 09:18.000]  air at all of it we also have a very very important report as well that is
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.960]  going to be getting into the Federal Reserve and does the general public
[09:21.960 --> 09:27.960]  understand that it's a private run-for-profit bank ruling and hijacking
[09:27.960 --> 09:38.080]  this country now that said ladies and gentlemen we need to get into the fact
[09:38.080 --> 09:44.160]  that it is incredibly predictable that right as the president is set to sign
[09:44.160 --> 09:52.360]  an executive order turning the internet over to a handful of megacorporations
[09:52.480 --> 10:00.280]  that right as that is happening that right as that is unfolding that right as
[10:00.280 --> 10:07.760]  all of this is going on magically the White House Pentagon and other systems
[10:07.760 --> 10:14.240]  supposedly get hacked from China and I'm not saying that Russia and China don't
[10:14.240 --> 10:17.600]  go around hacking into things so do Western governments I mean all these
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.440]  countries mandate that their manufacturers put backdoors into all the
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.320]  tech because governments and corporations all access into it then they
[10:27.320 --> 10:32.280]  use the backdoors and all the tech as a pretext to take people's liberties and
[10:32.280 --> 10:38.160]  freedoms and bring in more control but almost no one but CNET news and a few
[10:38.160 --> 10:45.840]  others is even getting half the story this is about not just the executive
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.320]  orders that Obama uses now to go to war to hand over authority to the UN to
[10:51.320 --> 10:58.800]  continue torture secret arrest the list goes on and on but it's also about the
[10:58.800 --> 11:02.560]  fact that if you read what Obama's saying in the leaked text of the executive
[11:02.560 --> 11:08.520]  order that came out a few weeks ago they say oh well a Yahoo and Microsoft and
[11:08.520 --> 11:20.000]  Google and all these big companies Sun Microsystems Cisco they are all for
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.880]  they are all for what's happening so it's okay they're stakeholders it's that
[11:26.880 --> 11:31.320]  UN model of where they have groups that are lobbying and funding them that
[11:31.320 --> 11:36.240]  stand again and then they supposedly speak for the public and it's like oh
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.200]  well these big megacorporations most of which were founded and funded or
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.240]  currently controlled by Western intelligence agencies they say this is a
[11:45.240 --> 11:50.520]  good idea something they want to do kind of like DARPA and the Pentagon helped
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.040]  create the internet our purchases are buying bandwidth
[11:54.040 --> 11:59.400]  software engineers programmers we contributed to building you know what
[11:59.400 --> 12:06.520]  is the web but the seed of it came out of the globalist mind back in the 60s on
[12:06.520 --> 12:13.320]  record to create a technotronic technocracy to wire the world and give
[12:13.320 --> 12:17.480]  them over the horizon future predictability of mass movements and
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.200]  individual movements that's why they're mapping the world and Google has NSA
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.560]  satellites and smart dust and RFID and cash was societies that's what all this
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.520]  is and so now they're just bringing us into the new phase it's all been mapped
[12:32.520 --> 12:42.840]  out you notice that one week before the naked body scanners one week before the
[12:42.840 --> 12:49.080]  naked body scanners hundreds of them that had been purchased a year before the
[12:49.080 --> 12:57.840]  order had gone in to build them a year before their delivery was to be coming
[12:57.840 --> 13:04.400]  up in that January so two years ago on Christmas day there is a underwear
[13:04.400 --> 13:11.240]  bomber who the US government that's the manker government gets on the airplane
[13:11.240 --> 13:19.240]  so they put him on the airplane drooling drug and then he has a firecracker go
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.240]  off in his pants and then they go on the news that night and said don't worry
[13:23.240 --> 13:29.200]  we'll put these machines in next week and said we just got the idea we're gonna
[13:29.200 --> 13:32.680]  do this because of him they ordered him a year before churn off they had a
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.320]  homeland security made money off of it that's totally illegal they don't care
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.280]  because it's a wall of criminality a complete and total takeover well it's
[13:42.280 --> 13:53.960]  the same story here today launches today launches cyber security awareness month
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.720]  that's federal globalist takeover the web turning everyone in IT and a little
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.360]  globalist federally globally certified minions who get off on their new 007
[14:02.360 --> 14:07.800]  role of being little spies it's internet taxes internet IDs internet regulations
[14:07.800 --> 14:13.320]  control tier one tier two internet to shutting down the old free web by taking
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.960]  over roads and turning them into toll roads that's what they're doing national
[14:18.960 --> 14:25.040]  cyber security awareness month kicks off today with official launch event
[14:25.040 --> 14:30.880]  business summit and releases of online safety survey October 1st and what do you
[14:30.880 --> 14:38.080]  know two days before this on the Saturday on the 29th of September 2012 the
[14:38.080 --> 14:44.440]  White House gets attacked on the eve of Obama saying I'll protect us from them
[14:44.440 --> 14:51.720]  shy comes even if I gotta do in an executive order besides Google and
[14:51.720 --> 14:57.320]  Microsoft and and all the other big companies they stand behind me and we're
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.800]  voluntarily gonna track everything you do and make you use internet ID YouTube
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.680]  on by Google's getting ready for that they're all getting ready for it banning
[15:06.680 --> 15:11.640]  you off the web buying or sell just like a no fly list a no internet list a no
[15:11.640 --> 15:15.200]  commerce list if you're not a good little globalist face scanning the buy and
[15:15.200 --> 15:20.200]  sell does anyone understand the off-the-charge ratifications of what
[15:20.200 --> 15:26.520]  we're talking about here does anyone even begin to understand how serious this
[15:26.520 --> 15:34.640]  is and how patently ridiculously filthily obvious and in your face it is
[15:34.640 --> 15:41.160]  and staged just like the stupid underwear bomber you know when you're
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.720]  conscious and awake and informed it's like watching it's watching the news
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.640]  watching the general public is like watching sloths in slow motion
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.680]  literally talking to people is like talking to sloths and I don't
[15:55.680 --> 15:59.880]  understand it I'll understand people who are not awake and who are not alive and
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.280]  it's all over the place people that even have intellects and have minds they
[16:04.280 --> 16:09.640]  don't want to and it's from television viewing I can tell when somebody is a
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.960]  TV head I don't care they got 150 IQ I can tell how much television someone
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.840]  watches because they've they have this look in their eyes they value the
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.240]  lethargy of the mind they value being conned they value not understanding
[16:25.240 --> 16:30.520]  complex systems they value not not being into the mysteries of the universe
[16:30.520 --> 16:38.720]  they value it and I it just drives me up the stinking frickin wall man I am so
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.680]  tired of it they go on the news I mean that's how I knew it was staged that
[16:42.680 --> 16:46.080]  day before it even came out they said don't worry we just decided to put
[16:46.080 --> 16:50.480]  naked body scanners in next week and I've been talking about it for a year
[16:50.480 --> 16:57.160]  because they put the multi-billion dollar purchase orders in we've been
[16:57.160 --> 17:00.080]  talking about the conflict of him working for the company being a
[17:00.080 --> 17:06.320]  consultant even as he was the head of homeland security he had begun some of
[17:06.320 --> 17:10.600]  the test programs and now he was out of homeland security Michael Chertoff making
[17:10.600 --> 17:15.840]  all this money himself millions and millions off of it and it's just sick
[17:15.840 --> 17:22.160]  and it's the same thing here this is this is pointed at people that are in a
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.200]  trance I mean anyone with a brain sees the PR rollout for the takeover of the
[17:26.200 --> 17:30.520]  web right there the proof of the conspiracy is that not to mention all
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.040]  the documentation all the reporters coming out from the New York Times and
[17:34.040 --> 17:37.440]  CNN about how they were all run with a Pentagon and foreign governments and the
[17:37.440 --> 17:44.520]  CIA the CIA and the government and the FBI are now clients for foreign
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.960]  interests and they're like managers middle managers that get a cut of how

[24:08.480 --> 24:15.480]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[24:15.480 --> 24:23.480]  George straight was singing seashores of old Mexico
[24:23.480 --> 24:37.640]  you know why I'm yelling and screaming it's that I know where this road goes I
[24:37.640 --> 24:42.160]  know the globalist are I know what their global plan is and I know they're
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.560]  going to execute it if we don't stop them and we are living in a science fiction
[24:47.560 --> 24:53.080]  horror movie the globalist in their own words depending on which document are
[24:53.080 --> 24:58.960]  six to ten years behind Brazilian Brzezinski has said it countless others
[24:58.960 --> 25:05.400]  have broken down the fact that they are behind but I intend to make a new
[25:05.400 --> 25:09.840]  special report in the next few weeks that basically breaks down their their new
[25:09.840 --> 25:15.280]  world order plan in a simplistic fashion people think it's complex but it'll
[25:15.280 --> 25:20.280]  actually be simplistic and then show the timeline of where they plan to go where
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.760]  they want to be versus where they are right now and if there was just a
[25:24.760 --> 25:30.120]  revolution of understanding in people's minds we could turn this around right
[25:30.120 --> 25:37.880]  now if we collectively come together with an understanding that being spied
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.920]  on without warrants is to enslave us not to keep us safe that the government is
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.880]  not a government but a foreign occupation force shipping drugs in as a
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.440]  pretext to break into our houses and run checkpoints and to fund their
[25:53.440 --> 25:59.200]  criminal takeover when we wake up to the fact that the CPS taking children is the
[25:59.200 --> 26:06.040]  last group you'd ever want children around in your life that the medical
[26:06.040 --> 26:10.400]  system has good people in it at the bottom but at the top is a Rockefeller
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.680]  controlled MD modern science of eugenics we live in the kingdom of eugenics we
[26:16.680 --> 26:23.040]  live in the kingdom of covert and overt testing and it's in the news but it's
[26:23.040 --> 26:27.600]  just a minor footnote hey the government admits they shot up you know 67,000
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.360]  kids in India last year with live weaponized polio yeah a bunch of them
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.600]  died others are paralyzed next in news we need to take all your rights away
[26:36.600 --> 26:42.320]  because al-qaeda and in the other news the government runs al-qaeda I mean it's
[26:42.320 --> 26:51.400]  it's just so insane and they only get away with this they only get away with
[26:51.400 --> 26:58.160]  this because the general public has been taught it's cute and funny to laugh at
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.320]  anybody who's informed or involved or who cares but that's changing more and
[27:03.320 --> 27:07.640]  more people realize it's about survival to care and it's not bad to be involved
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.440]  and it's not weird to be informed this morning I was exercising at a local
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.360]  natural pool here in Austin Texas swimming a couple miles about 5 a.m. went
[27:18.360 --> 27:25.160]  down there and there was a fellow there about he said hey you know this New York
[27:25.160 --> 27:29.040]  Times writer this whistleblower just came into town we were talking about how I
[27:29.040 --> 27:33.920]  had Amber Lyon on the CNN reporter that blew the whistle about how their
[27:33.920 --> 27:37.280]  government and foreign government run its fraud they cover up massacres and
[27:37.280 --> 27:42.680]  this is pure evil and he was like hey you know this New York Times reporter you
[27:42.680 --> 27:47.160]  know he'd he'd want to come on your show and I was going oh yeah I'm I've been
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.760]  working on getting him on and the guys are going friends with him here's his
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.080]  number and there were these old men who were swimmers who've gotten there and
[27:54.080 --> 27:58.960]  they were laughing at us and looking at me and laughing they obviously knew who I
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.960]  was and they were like trying to be dominant tough old men and they were you
[28:03.960 --> 28:07.800]  know into themselves because they were in great shape and all this and I looked
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.520]  at them and I just realized I'm threatening their whole world that
[28:12.520 --> 28:17.480]  America's the good guys they're part of the system you know yeah the CIA does
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.360]  bad stuff but you know they know best they know what they're doing you can
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.640]  tell these guys were like retired government types and I just thought
[28:25.640 --> 28:31.320]  about how incredibly weak they were mentally but it didn't matter that about
[28:31.320 --> 28:34.440]  10 more people there weren't many people there we're like coming over going oh
[28:34.440 --> 28:38.200]  yeah blah blah blah this that and then they saw that as they were getting ready
[28:38.200 --> 28:40.960]  to get in the water and it totally freaked them out because at first they
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.840]  were laughing at us and kind of pointing at us right in front of us right in
[28:46.840 --> 28:52.000]  front of us they were they were wanting to ridicule us like we care what they
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.720]  say or what they think like like we're gonna go curl up in a fetal position and
[28:56.720 --> 29:01.200]  urinate all over ourselves because because you people that suck off the
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.120]  government trough and the system and who get reflected glory from its evil
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.960]  worshipping its black altar of death you think you think laughing at us has any
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.160]  effect on us it has no effect on me but to make me recharge and turbo against
[29:15.160 --> 29:20.080]  all of you you will be defeated you murdering scum and all the servants of

[32:03.800 --> 32:08.240]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[32:08.240 --> 32:11.760]  to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[32:11.760 --> 32:15.520]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[32:15.520 --> 32:19.080]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[32:19.080 --> 32:22.200]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[32:22.200 --> 32:25.360]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[32:25.360 --> 32:29.720]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[32:29.720 --> 32:34.200]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[32:34.200 --> 32:37.560]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now
[32:37.560 --> 32:40.800]  discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and
[32:40.800 --> 32:44.280]  privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long

[33:20.280 --> 33:26.800]  mandry you recall what Clemens once said about war and now I didn't think I do
[33:26.800 --> 33:31.240]  something else he said war was too important to be left to the generals
[33:31.240 --> 33:39.520]  when he said that 50 years ago he might have been right but today war is too
[33:39.520 --> 33:46.240]  important to be left to politicians they have neither the time the training or
[33:46.240 --> 33:53.040]  the inclination for strategic thought resistance to tyrants is obedience to

[34:15.400 --> 34:22.800]  coming up all right let me just try to calmly go to the news information here
[34:22.800 --> 34:29.680]  today as we transmit worldwide where to begin let me just start back where I
[34:29.680 --> 34:39.200]  was at here White House confirms cyber attack a White House confirmed what's
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.960]  thought to downplay they always do that have the media hype total fear and then
[34:42.960 --> 34:49.600]  they act like the quiet father figures it's a playbook to downplay a report by
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.240]  conservative website on Sunday that it had been the victim of a cyber attack
[34:53.240 --> 34:58.960]  volunteering to Politico that no harm had been done the Washington Free Beacon
[34:58.960 --> 35:02.760]  reported that Chinese hackers had attacked a computer system in the
[35:02.760 --> 35:06.240]  White House military office yeah that came from the Secret Service I know
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.640]  where they get that stuff a White House official speaking on background late
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.040]  Sunday confirmed there was an attempted hack but said that it affected on the
[35:15.040 --> 35:19.680]  classified network it was isolated and that there was no evidence that any
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.160]  data had been stolen the attempted hack was you spearfishing in which an

[37:24.160 --> 37:28.880]  new giant NSA centers that are opening up in San Antonio that opened a year ago
[37:28.880 --> 37:34.040]  giant facility no one talks about local news goes down there and they grab
[37:34.040 --> 37:39.520]  their cameras from the the two local papers to the paper so I'm know the
[37:39.520 --> 37:43.440]  paper no our people went down there and handed them the successful lawsuit
[37:43.440 --> 37:48.440]  articles last week jacari Jackson Melissa Melton and explained to them they
[37:48.440 --> 37:51.560]  were there to go visit the visitor center which there isn't one they wanted to buy
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.120]  you know say shot glass they told them being sarcastic and just let them know
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.720]  that you know I was intending to basically sue the NSA if they took our
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.800]  stuff because they don't have a right to not have you go down there and videotape
[38:04.800 --> 38:10.280]  that they're down there a giant facility just like the TSA and I'm gonna get to
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.160]  that in a minute had to admit because the lawsuits that you can film them they
[38:14.160 --> 38:18.720]  still try to intimidate you or set you up because they're criminals as their
[38:18.720 --> 38:21.800]  own members are getting convicted of what one guy stole almost a million
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.480]  dollars he said oh we all do it we're addicted that's why we get the jobs to
[38:26.480 --> 38:32.920]  rob you of course of course why do you think the brown shirts joined Adolf
[38:32.920 --> 38:39.840]  Ila was Hitler because they got to have some fun and the Soviets hired the
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.600]  criminals out of the jails that's why they run a background check for TSA now
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.560]  wouldn't like this 10 years ago with their phasing and in now where they
[38:47.560 --> 38:52.520]  hire they go oh you got felonies here you're a convicted child molester that's
[38:52.520 --> 38:55.800]  their favorite oh you're a convicted rapist oh you're a you're a convicted
[38:55.800 --> 39:01.920]  car thief hey pal you're in charge I have a stack of articles on that today

[39:10.400 --> 39:19.880]  women you see Miss USA go in those pants it's freedom and when people don't like
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.560]  it like me they go that's a crazy man and you bet I am crazy I'm crazy because I
[39:24.560 --> 39:28.360]  love liberty I'm crazy because I got a backbone I'm crazy because I am in a fit
[39:28.360 --> 39:34.720]  of rage knowing that pure evil is taking over and I'm here to get people out of
[39:34.720 --> 39:52.440]  their trance I am beside myself I have fought for 17 plus years against the
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.840]  globalist and I am so concerned because it's all coming true it's all
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.080]  happening just as we said it would we successfully re-engineered reverse
[40:02.080 --> 40:07.080]  engineered all of it over a decade ago and now it's worse than we even thought
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.200]  you think I'm pleased to be right about this you think this is a good thing this
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.200]  is not a good thing this is a bad thing this is a horrible thing this is a
[40:15.200 --> 40:21.000]  painful thing this is an overwhelmingly horrible disgusting thing it's like
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.160]  thinking oh this lump you know I'd be like if your wife had a big lump on her
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.400]  breast and she goes oh it's not breast cancer baby and she and she goes in and
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.920]  it's a horrible stage for malignancy you know you're not like oh I was right it
[40:33.920 --> 40:46.160]  was breast cancer and then I see how weak the general public is how weak many
[40:46.160 --> 40:50.040]  of the quote resistors are the people in the alternative media how they're in it
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.440]  for themselves or don't even have full understanding of the deeper issues or
[40:54.440 --> 41:00.720]  even partial understanding and then I realize
[41:02.200 --> 41:06.920]  that as a society we're rotting and it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets
[41:06.920 --> 41:11.520]  better then I realize the good news there are so many good decent average
[41:11.520 --> 41:19.480]  people who were humbled and so they do not see themselves in the capacity they
[41:19.480 --> 41:24.960]  do not see themselves in the role as of resistors because they almost see it as
[41:24.960 --> 41:30.360]  polite that they're letting evil run over them they sit there like a Buddhist
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.000]  monk or something while Rome burns around them and we cannot be in that mode
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.440]  we've got to get out there and face this down and get angry about it and I too
[41:40.440 --> 41:45.200]  angry sometimes maybe but there's the added frustration of not just the New
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.360]  World Order but having to deal with everything that goes on in the oiling
[41:50.360 --> 41:56.000]  and maintenance of this platform trying to direct my energies and analysis at
[41:56.000 --> 42:05.120]  the enemy because let me tell you ladies and gentlemen it's all gonna come
[42:05.120 --> 42:10.600]  true we're under soft kill right now they're just testing agents on us
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.760]  figuring out how to gauge it seeing if we'll wake up to the fact that they're
[42:14.760 --> 42:19.800]  just openly killing us we just cancer exploding all around us disease every
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.080]  degenerative disorder exploding off the charts I mean they're killing us they're
[42:24.080 --> 42:29.080]  killing us with a GMO it's even on record sterilizes kills deforms and all
[42:29.080 --> 42:36.840]  the animals they feed it to and the huge magnitude of it is why they're getting
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.760]  away with it because it's show off the charts that a regular person cannot
[42:41.760 --> 42:48.480]  sanely deal with this so they go into denial I am a sane person but it has
[42:48.480 --> 42:52.880]  driven me insane knowing the information and by insane to an outward
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.480]  person hearing that the heavy breathing the sighing the tooth grinding all of it
[42:57.480 --> 43:00.720]  it's like well that guy's nuts we'll know if you know psycho killers are
[43:00.720 --> 43:04.040]  poisoning everyone around you the public's giggling at you sucking their
[43:04.040 --> 43:08.640]  thumbs in trances falling off the edge of cliffs all around you people are
[43:08.640 --> 43:12.400]  moving in slow motion in a matrix you know the general public is literally in
[43:12.400 --> 43:21.000]  a trance in the aggregate hundreds of millions believe you and listen to you
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.120]  and have found out you're telling the truth but then they still look to you
[43:24.120 --> 43:32.480]  to be able to have all the answers it just makes me physically ill it makes me
[43:32.480 --> 43:40.040]  physically ill to know that it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse
[43:40.040 --> 43:45.240]  and that we have a giant arrested development childlike population watching
[43:45.240 --> 43:49.160]  giant fat rappers with pants hanging down around their ankles with huge
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.320]  bellies in fur coats and this is force-fed on television to the young
[43:54.320 --> 44:00.280]  people teaching them how to shoot each other and to know that inside MTV that
[44:00.280 --> 44:05.240]  they weaponized it 20 years ago on purpose to destroy the youth I mean we
[44:05.240 --> 44:09.680]  already knew that but to know from insiders that it was consciously done
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.880]  just confirms it all it's just it's we're being hit by torpedoes chemical
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.520]  biological cultural cultural viruses cultural death switches cultural
[44:20.520 --> 44:25.880]  destruction and then I even feel guilty getting up here on air and playing all
[44:25.880 --> 44:29.480]  these pathetic welfare people talking about their Obama phones and stuff
[44:29.480 --> 44:33.560]  because we're all laughing at it is laughing at it because it's so sad but
[44:33.560 --> 44:39.920]  it's even sick to laugh at it none of it's funny it's disgusting and those of
[44:39.920 --> 44:43.360]  us laughing at things like that because deep down it makes us feel superior or
[44:43.360 --> 44:47.960]  maybe it's just so embarrassing we're laughing because we're uncomfortable we've
[44:47.960 --> 44:51.680]  been stunted we've been damaged as well from the heights that our minds would
[44:51.680 --> 45:04.880]  have would have would have sworn to sword to like Icarus but you sail to the sun
[45:04.880 --> 45:13.440]  you fly to the sun it melts your wax wings and you fall to earth but the
[45:13.440 --> 45:19.080]  globalist they didn't fly and then fall to earth no they they burrowed until they
[45:19.080 --> 45:23.880]  broke through to the deepest dimensions of hell and now they write in our
[45:23.880 --> 45:29.080]  societal essence our societal guts our societal blood on the walls of society
[45:29.080 --> 45:37.360]  they're horrible they're horrible demonic artwork all around us the
[45:37.360 --> 45:44.800]  ugliness of it the stand shot careful you do not stare into the abyss for the
[45:44.800 --> 45:53.920]  abyss will change you you will become the abyss the abyss the abyss of black
[45:53.920 --> 46:01.480]  death as deep as the gravity wells of the greatest black holes
[46:07.640 --> 46:12.840]  okay let's go ahead and get to the next pieces of news here oh look CNN's
[46:12.840 --> 46:18.120]  warning you of the of the new threat your smartphone will eventually be hacked
[46:18.120 --> 46:22.280]  oh because you built backdoors into it of course I've been telling you this is
[46:22.280 --> 46:26.800]  all just total hacks total things are gonna be breaking down takedowns because
[46:26.800 --> 46:29.480]  they built backdoors into it then they're gonna get up on the news and say
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.040]  because the Chinese government orders their manufacturers to put these
[46:33.040 --> 46:40.400]  backdoors in the chips under global governance agreements and compacts they
[46:40.400 --> 46:44.240]  have built backdoors into everything because the devices you purchase are
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.520]  not there for you to use them that's just one function the main function is to
[46:48.520 --> 46:54.360]  track you and predict your future movements while damaging your DNA with a
[46:54.360 --> 47:01.240]  radiation burst in the microwave radiation field your smartphone will
[47:01.240 --> 47:05.200]  eventually be hacked CNN security experts have warned for years our
[47:05.200 --> 47:11.320]  smartphones are due for a major cyber attack oh really like PCs back in the
[47:11.320 --> 47:15.440]  early days the 1990s mobile phones are largely unprotected by antivirus software
[47:15.440 --> 47:18.760]  don't worry though there's companies willing to sell that to you of course
[47:18.760 --> 47:24.160]  designed the viruses and they're a treasure trove of valuable information so
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.640]  why has the smartphone Armageddon happened yet basic economics is one
[47:28.640 --> 47:33.240]  reason cyber thieves are making so much money attacking Windows PCs that there
[47:33.240 --> 47:38.040]  hasn't been much incentive to change tactics so really and it just goes on
[47:38.040 --> 47:43.080]  with more BS let me get into this here this is really one of the top stories
[47:43.080 --> 47:46.880]  today and I haven't covered this properly I haven't given it justice it's a big
[47:46.880 --> 47:49.640]  deal and everybody needs to be part of it
[47:49.640 --> 47:55.280]  TSA confiscates camera deletes footage of checkpoint TSA worker steals memory

[48:24.320 --> 48:28.400]  have it screen-shotted saying the TSA does not prohibit the public passengers
[48:28.400 --> 48:33.320]  are pressed from photographing videotaping or filming at security checkpoints as
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.000]  long as the screening process is not interfered with see cops can't arrest you
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.240]  for filming him unless you interfere with their activities they now call that
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.920]  300 yards away if you're filming them doing anything now and in 12 states they
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.560]  arrest you in charge of wiretapping which the statutes all state that in public
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.400]  you have no perception of privacy it's not wiretapping but that doesn't matter
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.640]  they've got kept juries a lot of times that are paid cash and you know they're
[48:55.640 --> 48:59.040]  to send you to prison because that's all part of the evil you don't film in

[50:26.960 --> 50:31.080]  the enemy is actually scared that's why they have the bravada and the in-your-face
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.680]  and trying to rush their whole program because they're behind schedule they're
[50:35.680 --> 50:43.200]  in trouble and they know they know we've beaten them over and over and over
[50:43.200 --> 50:50.040]  again and the next time we beat them it will be for ever well they'll be shadows
[50:50.040 --> 50:54.080]  and he will again but this great battle if we survive it will be the great
[50:54.080 --> 50:59.120]  reversal for our species and will give us the greatest shot ever to reach alpha

[51:04.200 --> 51:08.200]  and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade

[51:11.480 --> 51:15.320]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[51:15.320 --> 51:19.040]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[51:19.040 --> 51:22.200]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[51:22.200 --> 51:25.440]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[51:25.440 --> 51:29.600]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[51:29.600 --> 51:34.120]  Africans eat fermented porches Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is
[51:34.120 --> 51:37.720]  a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans
[51:37.720 --> 51:41.120]  can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally

[54:18.160 --> 54:22.360]  all right let me tell you what's coming up when Max Kaiser is on with us and
[54:22.360 --> 54:29.400]  then into the third hour when I have open phones today I'm gonna spend a good
[54:29.400 --> 54:32.440]  portion of time playing some of the news reports we've done in the nightly news
[54:32.440 --> 54:35.440]  because they're so powerful and I want the full radio listeners to be able to
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.280]  hear it also prisonplanet.tv viewers right now I'll be able to see it TSA
[54:41.280 --> 54:46.280]  rescinds approval to film in response to opt-out campaign maybe maybe maybe
[54:46.280 --> 54:50.480]  they'll rescind the law that they can't rape my wife
[54:50.480 --> 54:54.760]  maybe they'll rescind the law that they can't come take the jewelry out of my
[54:54.760 --> 54:59.800]  wife's bedroom maybe they'll rescind the law that I can have my second
[54:59.800 --> 55:04.520]  amendment because we're living under executive orders see over lawsuits and
[55:04.520 --> 55:08.040]  things they had to have on their website started about four years ago that
[55:08.040 --> 55:13.240]  of course you can film us as long as you interfere but in their training videos
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.720]  they tell them someone's video and they must be a terrorist so harass them so
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.800]  the cops in these videos that Watson's linked to come up and act like you're
[55:21.800 --> 55:24.480]  doing something wrong and they'll tell you it's the law we're gonna arrest you
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.240]  and then they'll try to intimidate you to turn it off but if you call their
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.800]  bluff they back off because they're still a little bit of sanity left in the
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.000]  courts you know they're filming you but you're not supposed to film them and I'm
[55:38.000 --> 55:43.040]  so sick of even our articles saying officers they call them officers they're
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.760]  not even sworn officers but they have sworn officers come up and do their dirty
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.680]  work and that is so shameful and at the end of this article by Paul Joseph
[55:51.680 --> 55:54.760]  Watson there's a special comment from Alex Jones because we're launching this
[55:54.760 --> 55:59.560]  first amendment week for the week of Thanksgiving to opt out of the naked
[55:59.560 --> 56:02.960]  body scanners the top scientist admitted given people cancer including the TSA
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.320]  workers at the airports where they've been testing them for nine years they
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.560]  had them at six airports starting nine years ago I was like a seven-fold
[56:10.560 --> 56:15.120]  increase in cancers just at Boston I mean that's why they hire stupid little
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.320]  criminals now the first TSA were mainly like post office type people they weren't
[56:19.320 --> 56:24.320]  bad people now they're a bunch of scum and by the way that's in the news here's
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.080]  the Associated Press the Daily Mail is also reporting on it I was addicted to
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.880]  stealing and everyone else did it too X TSA agent reveals epidemic of thefts
[56:32.880 --> 56:37.120]  from passengers as he admits he took almost one million in possessions
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.320]  ladies and gentlemen I have been robbed well we've had stuff stolen out of our
[56:42.320 --> 56:50.040]  bags electrical stuff though we've had a baby baby Tiffany teething ring stolen
[56:50.040 --> 56:53.640]  seven years ago flying out of JFK back to Austin then I bought my newborn
[56:53.640 --> 56:59.600]  daughter I had Dr. Pachinicon he had a sleeping pill stolen that's what they
[56:59.600 --> 57:05.560]  really is is addictive drugs folks you fly with your medication sleeping pills
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.840]  or whatever it's gone I mean these are drug addicts they're gonna some of them
[57:09.840 --> 57:14.160]  are drug addicts others are pervs they all got a poison they all got a vice in
[57:14.160 --> 57:18.840]  the devil's little playhouse but let me tell you they say idle hands the
[57:18.840 --> 57:24.240]  devil's workshop let me tell you TSA and airports are the devil's workshop
[57:24.240 --> 57:28.960]  that's where the real slamming and mammon goes on there's a special comment
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.920]  down there at the bottom there is an organized move on behalf of governments
[57:32.920 --> 57:35.760]  corporation to boy the first amendment out of existence this is why info wars
[57:35.760 --> 57:38.860]  is pioneering a new civil rights movement that is not based around race
[57:38.860 --> 57:42.880]  sex or any other minority issue the fact that our rights are being violated
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.680]  characterizes suspicious and terroristic threatens the freedom of every individual
[57:46.680 --> 57:53.080]  no matter from what race gender creed or religion they originate and it goes
[57:53.080 --> 57:56.440]  on we are being systematically intimidated out of expressing our
[57:56.440 --> 57:59.240]  right to free speech as part of an advancement towards a new dark age of
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.320]  tyranny we are calling on like-minded people to join us in the opt-out and
[58:03.320 --> 58:07.080]  film campaign by the way since we put this up last week they've removed the
[58:07.080 --> 58:11.040]  thing where they say you can film with the understanding that you will in all
[58:11.040 --> 58:15.840]  likelihood face official oppression for doing so the TSA is a federal agency
[58:15.840 --> 58:20.240]  staff full of liar steves and petty tyrants we have links to that proof of
[58:20.240 --> 58:23.440]  that who like to harass and terrorize innocent Americans who refused to
[58:23.440 --> 58:29.000]  comply with degrading treatment who refused to
[58:29.000 --> 58:34.400]  partake in obedience training the risk of being harassed or even arrested is
[58:34.400 --> 58:38.280]  there but there's a bigger risk I go on to say and not standing up against the
[58:38.280 --> 58:40.520]  scene
[58:42.440 --> 58:51.440]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network for thousands of years
[58:51.440 --> 58:55.280]  silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative but not all silver is
[58:55.280 --> 58:58.680]  equal silver soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically
[58:58.680 --> 59:02.400]  shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers
[59:02.400 --> 59:06.160]  it can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology
[59:06.160 --> 59:09.840]  silver soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in
[59:09.840 --> 59:13.440]  labs to kill bacteria and viruses enabling it to kill without direct

[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.960]  he is going to be riding shotgun right here with us ladies and gentlemen that
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.840]  is coming up and then I'll get more into TSA rescinds approval for film in
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.760]  response to opt-out campaign federal agency removes web page admitting
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.480]  filming is not prohibited as they need to engage their color of law fraud
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.400]  behavior and get back to groping your wife or whatever they're into you know
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.480]  it's a blessing it's better that they just rob our bags I mean I actually don't
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.680]  mind that as much as the fact that I can't fly with my wife and children
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.520]  because I can't let weird perverts obvious potbellied perverts who you know
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.280]  see a good-looking woman or little kids they want to go after and they pull
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.600]  them out you know and then drag them over and and then and then and then also
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.160]  some of them just get off on the kids crying others like looking in diapers
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.040]  especially you fully loaded ones you know you see a fully loaded diaper they
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.760]  they they see it is like I guess a fully loaded baked potatoes I mean they
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.160]  want to get in there and I guess eat it but you know the the the PCs I'm sorry
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.520]  I just am thinking about the TSA workers you know get I just that'd be a good
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.800]  image of TSA worker with a diaper like it's a taco you know and just going
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.960]  after they like ripping colostomy bags off all the time I mean I'm telling you
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.840]  either they like it I mean I think it's better when they just want to rob our
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  bags I mean that wouldn't be as bad it's like another it's a government tax you
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.040]  know government does that they maybe the TSA can have a machine that grabs you
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.080]  by the ankles and shakes the chain the change out you know and and then they
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.840]  could cattle prod you every time you had a quarter in your pocket because that's
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.240]  they can say that the image of al-qaeda is on a quarter you're like that's
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.680]  George Washington they go no it's not conspiracy theorist and then they apply
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.520]  more electricity you know what I'm realizing everybody's like man some
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.160]  people that work here but listen to me for like ten years they go Alex this
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.680]  sounds like the old you because there's not stinking cameras in here because
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.240]  we're doing the construction I guess there are cameras but we got them turned
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.840]  off there's a I tell you by the way CJ the new doors you've put in the whole
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.080]  crew is just so wonderful they do the best job they can and they do
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:01.040]  a pittance a penance oh there you go TSA stands by officers at her pat down a
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.440]  elderly woman in Florida they removed her fully loaded adult diaper I remember

[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.240]  strong but it doesn't send me into this that's definitely it ought to be a
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.880]  schedule three drug about 6 a.m. I had a big Starbucks hot coffee and then I went
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:39.720]  for a jog and then a swim and I mean I literally it's like I'm on methamphetamine

[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:22.120]  compadre but so much is going on what is QE unlimited going to do we're seeing
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.480]  what you predicted start to happen if you want to make any adjustments to your
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.520]  April total implosion date again I want you to answer this question what does
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.440]  total collapse means you never really define that fully you start going into
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:39.680]  statements about gulags and people strapped forcibly to video games in
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.880]  slave camps which they do do in China LA Times headline sleigh 50 dragons to go
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.840]  free people think I'm joking I know this sounds insane to new listeners folks
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.400]  reality isn't saying there's so much more going on and then what else is on
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.200]  your radar today Max Kaiser all right Alex great to be with you yeah I'm
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:02.520]  sticking to my target 26 flat 26 weeks to go total total breakdown things are
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.800]  unfolding pretty much as I expected a total breakdown would be currency
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:13.080]  collapse and you mentioned gold approaching 1800 that's not really the
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.160]  big story the big story is that gold has hit this week an all-time high in euro
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.960]  it's hit an all-time high in rupee it's hit an all-time high in swiss frank and
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.520]  if you look what's happening in Iran I just told you a story their currency is
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:34.280]  collapsed by 20% in one day this is part of the currency wars this is World War
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.680]  3 we're in it right now it started in really 2008 2009 this is a race to the
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.600]  bottom all the big countries are trying to get out of their economic downturns
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:50.160]  by debasing the value of their fiat paper money gold and silver have been
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:57.800]  tracking ever higher and so that is very much in play so a currency collapse is
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.080]  what I mean when I say you have or hyperinflation is another word for it
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.400]  when you between on 26 weeks from now and it's coming out every day that the
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:15.440]  amount of debts that the banks have been hiding are increasing exponentially and
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.800]  so this requires ever more money printing so just more the same but we're
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.320]  definitely getting to the to the timeline you know when they print all
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.120]  that money Alex they try to make sure that it doesn't end up making the fight
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.400]  price of food and energy go up too fast so a lot of you know you have to
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.360]  understand these wars and Afghanistan and Iraq and around the world this is
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.200]  how they get rid a lot of the excess dollars they they get rid of it by
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.760]  dumping it in these countries in in terms of war because there's not no
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.960]  cheaper way to get rid of money than to drop bombs and being a war so that's
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.400]  the deflationary offset to all the money printing but even so they still can't
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.240]  keep the price of gold from getting all-time highs and all these major
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.440]  currencies the new all-time high in gold and dollar will be shortly coming same
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:10.280]  thing for silver and we've got you know more of the same I mean it's just it's
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:17.440]  playing out pretty much as I I've expected it would okay and the general
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.600]  public max literally doesn't know what planet they're on some people are waking
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.000]  up more but what do you expect the yuppies to do the ones that'll stand
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.600]  around and laugh at people like you or I for living on the real planet when
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.440]  things begin to really unravel will they will they when the government says that
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.160]  those of us criticizing the government are at fault because that's already
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.400]  started will the yuppies you know demand our heads or what will happen or will
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.400]  they just suck their thumbs well you people are going to be sucking their
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.440]  thumbs as you say but on the margin on the periphery there's really economic
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.880]  collapse people in Greece are suffering a massive depression people in Spain are
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.440]  now suffering a massive depression you know I mentioned on your show a year ago
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.240]  that the crisis in Europe would progress in the order that the countries are
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.560]  vulnerable and that generally means size it's no coincidence that Greece and
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.280]  Ireland and Portugal were the first to be taken over by the banksters and now
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.360]  with the profits they made destroying those economies and remember this has
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.160]  made banksters incredible amounts of billions and billions of people destroying
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.080]  these countries they now have the war chest to take on a country like Spain
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.880]  once Spain is now in the crosshairs Spain will soon join Greece and demand a
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.880]  bailout and in exchange they will forego their sovereignty after Spain will
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:39.280]  come Italy and of course Italy always goes to the bankers 90% of it who then
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.480]  used it to bring down the next country while the media goes along with the
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.520]  hoax that the bailouts actually go into the people and that they're to blame I
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:51.800]  mean the ultimate scyop lies within lies covered with more lies and then still
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.680]  more lies the federalization you've heard that term for the Eurozone these
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.040]  countries are all coming under the auspices of the IMF World Bank oh
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:05.400]  here's a fantastic story from this week the World Health Organization is
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:13.080]  introducing a global tax on cigarettes this to me is the first tangible proof
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.680]  of this new world order concept in terms of global taxation World Health
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.200]  Organization global tax on cigarettes this is the beginning because the
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:27.640]  Eurozone as it collapses there will be a necessity to create a new global central
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.920]  bank to roll out all the European that's right that's right stay there we
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.000]  gotta go to break but you're right Max they always globally demonize cigarettes
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.720]  which is reasonable on the surface to first ban smoking in bars then on the
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.320]  street then in your house then to tax what's left this was always to be the
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.040]  first global UN tax and then it'll be on everything else they're gonna through

[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:44.240]  get us in line to be dominated non-criminal populations are being

[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.160]  is in fact police all over the country admit they're told now take a mom in of
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.120]  her seat belt in on get people in jail get them in the system get them used to
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.240]  it this is it a criminal takeover max Kaiser I know you talk about the gulag
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.360]  archipelago the casino gulag but getting back into the global collapse you
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.000]  got interrupted by the break when you were getting into Baroso people can
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.440]  type in federalization of Europe into news and they can just see three weeks
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.160]  ago the president of the EU Commission Baroso saying we're getting rid of
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:25.920]  sovereignty I mean it's it's it's all quoted they're on TV saying it they're
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.520]  bragging they've conquered Europe they've conquered us and the bankers say
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.960]  they want to bankrupt us why do the bankers the mega bankers want to make
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:40.360]  us so poor Max Kaiser it's an axiomatic truth that the poorer they make us the
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:44.960]  richer they get and they're doing a good job getting richer you know they look
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.840]  at Ireland here's a story I just said it to you in Ireland they have a bank there
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:56.080]  angle of the Anglo-Irish bank it's 99.8% owned by the taxpayer they were just
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.520]  forced to make a 1 billion euro bond payment that's on unsecured bond
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:09.080]  payment for the banksters on behalf of the banksters and that 1 billion dollar
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.880]  liability is not going to be have to be borne by the citizens now though these
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.640]  bonds are unsecured bonds and when the people were in these deals originally it
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:23.160]  says clearly on the covenant of the bond this bond is very risky it's unbacked
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:27.120]  it's unguaranteed you may lose everything but the government is
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.960]  completely corrupt with the banksters and they're forcing this billion dollar
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.440]  wealth transfer this is on top of the Anglo-Irish wealth transfer billions of
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.000]  dollars transferred so that people in Ireland are leaving in droves thousands
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.520]  tens of thousands of people are leaving Ireland like they have historically
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.640]  before the boom years of the of the 90s same as true of these other countries so
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.880]  that people are now migrants roaming the world with no place to go no jobs and
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.120]  they're being picked off you know they end up going into the the airport the
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.040]  TSA is waiting for them they've lost all their jobs and in their home country and
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.600]  they ended up being funneled into the prison system or they work for pennies
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.200]  a day and and now they're serfs and that's all quite calculated and makes a
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:19.040]  few people extraordinarily wealthy no doubt and there's just no end to it
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.600]  what do you make of Monsanto and Bill Gates and the banks all invested and
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.760]  that prop 37 poll show is going to pass two to one will that hurt the Monsanto
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:33.920]  if we're allowed to actually read what's in the food or or will the feds as
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.760]  Obama has said sign executive order just countermanding the state government I
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.000]  love the headlines on Monsanto this past week you know the floods that swept
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.040]  through and washed out so many crops the corporate owned media had the
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:55.320]  headlines that thank God these crops are Monsanto seeds and they survived the
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.920]  floods you know intact more than if they were not genetically modified seeds so
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.840]  never mind the fact that the business practices of these company companies to
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:10.120]  begin with are directly the result leading to the destabilization of all
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.120]  these networks which leads the problem to begin with you know Monsanto is part
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.400]  of the corporate mafia they own the media so they're their media spin is
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.240]  always going to be positive they are one of the deadliest you know I did a
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.680]  survey five six years ago what people thought was the deadliest company in the
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.400]  world I thought Exxon would be number one but in fact Monsanto Monsanto is the
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.120]  most hated company in the world you know going back to Agent Orange and the
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.040]  Vietnam War right up through terminated before that they would dump deadly docks
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.800]  and one drop basically kills you and bury it secretly in black neighborhoods yeah
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.040]  no this is a really the most evil you know company listed but if you want to
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.280]  buy unfortunately there are people who are making money buying into evil so they
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.200]  buy Monsanto stock they buy prison at Corrections Corps of America stock and
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.600]  they buy the equity in the companies that are doing the school I could see the
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.040]  new thing in a major scientific study if I've got it the stack permission ever
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.720]  got to it it's been conclusively proven that roundup in all mammal species
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.680]  destroys the sperm reduces fertility who would have thunk it max well you know I
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:25.400]  got I got a hand it to RT Russia today there apparently they're gonna do a one
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:33.800]  year online video cam of rats being fed Monsanto and you will be able to see the
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.680]  tumor growth in real time they you know the the report that you had on prison
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.520]  planet and infowars of the rats and who were being fed Monsanto products
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.160]  developing these incredible tumors they're gonna recreate that but it's
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.640]  gonna be online on television right now go how extreme we're on the march the
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:58.680]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.680]  cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.560]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.000]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.160]  beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:28.640]  beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.160]  Japanese eat Miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in

[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:42.600]  again destroy the industry ship the jobs overseas and then many people pretty
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.560]  much only have a future if it's on welfare but then attached to that of
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:51.520]  these wastelands and the government says oh now we'll take control your food but
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:59.760]  oh big sis is a friend mrs. sataro mrs. Obama Michelle she says she's gonna
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.600]  decide what you eat now and now nationwide the feds say mama and daddy
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.720]  don't don't pack that lunch anymore max I guess I mean what do you expect admit
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.400]  the prices are going up on the food they're gonna decide what you eat but
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:17.880]  they say GMOs good they're just gonna tell you no sugar or fat Max Kaiser well
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:23.160]  you know I don't live in over there one that's one of the reasons is that it's
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:28.400]  hard to get decent food for all the problems that we have here in Europe
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.440]  in the food is not one of them at the moment you know they have the common
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.160]  agricultural policy for example in France which means that you have an
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:42.960]  a plethora of fantastic food at your fingertips but in the US that's a huge
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.040]  problem you know leads to obesity and starvation at the same time there's a
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.840]  billion obese people in the world just like there's a billion starving people
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.520]  in the world is both the result of malnutrition both the result of faulty
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.400]  economics and so that's the two sides of the same problem and Monsanto wants to
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.680]  turn seed into a currency and they wanted therefore manipulate the currency
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.160]  just like any bank on Wall Street wants to manipulate the currency market in
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.200]  any country in any region or the bond market or the option market once you
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.080]  turn it into a currency then you can manipulate it because what if you had a
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.200]  recurring resource like seeds that every fall and every spring they're simply
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:26.040]  regenerated and you didn't have to buy them again they gave you the seeds to
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.960]  replant well that's no business model that I mean that would mean people could
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.440]  eat nature's bounty without having to pay nature a monthly nature tax yeah or
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:40.440]  restrict in banned vitamins and minerals feed you debilitating food so you've
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:45.160]  got to pay the military industrial complex a pharmacological complex money
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:49.600]  just to stay alive and then they've got it actually worried out to kill you as
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.160]  soon as they've sucked the money out of you I mean it I mean I'm not a big on
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:58.400]  quoting scripture but one phrase that did catch my eye was look at the lilies in
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.080]  the field they neither spin or toil was said by Jesus now meaning as I
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.800]  understand it that the plants are not out there you know working a nine to five
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.280]  job that you need to pay them as part of some economy that's manipulated and
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.400]  governed by outside forces and banksters they see it's a bounty it's nature's
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:23.000]  bounty it's providing for us if we simply have the humility to accept that and
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.680]  you can't allow that Monsanto's got to add insect genes and pesticide to the
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.400]  crops so they spread into other species and poison everything they want to be
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.840]  monetized the seeds that don't need to be monetized because it's perfect as it
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.080]  is no they get in the middle they intermediate this seed business and
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.920]  it that's why two thousand farmers a month or the day in India commit
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.200]  suicide Monsanto completely puts them out of business with the poison they use
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.200]  they drink the herbicide to get rid of themselves because it's all they have
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.240]  left they also point out that all that all that all that herbicide runs off
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.000]  through the Mississippi down into the Gulf and kills all the fish so now the
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  fish are dead to go along with your dead plants so how do you where do you get
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.720]  your food oh we have synthetic meat we make in the laboratory it wiggles like
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.560]  meat it's pink slime it's something that smells like meat but it's made in a
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.520]  laboratory has no nutrition whatsoever it'll either make you a beast or you'll
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:23.320]  starve to death and used to maybe every hundred years to be a red tide now the
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.840]  Texas coast you can't go down there at the time because it's like nerve gas I
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.960]  was down there once when it was happening was literally sick for weeks
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:35.440]  after people were animals were dying from it and birds were dead millions of
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.920]  fish that I could see dead everywhere and I went and looked it up and scientists
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.920]  have proven it's all the herbicide coming out but there's and it doesn't even
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.480]  work like they say it will I mean it's just pure fraud look you say when is it
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.520]  gonna hit here what should people do I think you have to understand the way
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.800]  that the narrative is structured it's structured like an Agatha Christie
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.400]  novel you know Agatha Christie novel one of the characters they all go to a big
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.920]  house in the mountains or something and one by one they die and they're trying
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.960]  to figure out who the murderer is that's the structure of the narrative so it's
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.080]  not one big apocalyptic the bomb goes off and all the characters die now they
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  go out they die one by one so here in Greece is like one of the early characters
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:23.600]  in this Agatha Christie novel it got taken out last year Portugal Ireland and
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.160]  now Spain you know who who's who's killing all these countries I wonder who
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:32.360]  now Spain is being taken out to the woodshed and put two caps in the back
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.680]  of their head then it'll be Italy Italy has 2400 tons of gold well we'll take
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.640]  your gold and we'll take everything else but now you're part of the dead group
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:46.120]  of European nations so it progresses in this way the US and the United Kingdom
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:50.640]  will be the last two to fall because the US has a world reserve currency and in
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.480]  the UK is the global center for bank fraud the bank fraud keeps this country
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.360]  alive and kicking and will be one of the last countries to collapse and the US
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:02.480]  of course has the world reserve currency and of course these two countries
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:06.320]  have the so-called special relationship so these two will be probably be the last
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.960]  two to fall after Spain after Italy then I think you got to look at Japan as I've
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:15.880]  mentioned before it's extremely vulnerable they've got 200% debt to GDP
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.600]  they're 100% reliant on energy coming to them from overseas energy prices like
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.320]  gold and silver will skyrocket as the currency collapses so then you have the
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.040]  second biggest economy in the world then collapse then you've got a fiat
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.640]  currency collapse now we're heading into January of next year then we're talking
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.200]  to Alex Jones and we're heading into April we're getting closer to my timeline
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.920]  of massive global currency collapse hyperinflation gold at 5,000 to 10,000
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:43.600]  ounce and it's all playing out in real time and the people who've met and put
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.960]  the most are the same people who are benefiting now corporate insiders
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.280]  backsters I know it's not government government left the building long ago
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.080]  there is no representational government it's dead buried a left in the 70s we
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:04.120]  just have corporations and extras and they're just wholesale thieving and what
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.960]  happens next I mean is there I mean the bankers why would Goldman Sachs and JP
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.880]  Morgan and others every time I turn on Bloomberg shows where they have all
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:19.720]  these insiders on Bloomberg radio and whenever I read the Financial Times of
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.320]  London or you name it I mean I can pull the articles up right now where the
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.800]  foreign editor sits there and says yes it's tyrannical and we're getting rid of
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.520]  freedom and it's authoritarian it's for your own good and you of course build
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.800]  their bread runs everything and and and yes we've conquered Europe and we're
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:42.680]  gonna conquer you and I mean it's just and then you know you get FBI training
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:47.440]  manuals and I mean I got one last week that's from like six months ago and it
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.520]  says if anyone that says there's a world government is insane and dangerous
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.360]  look out so I don't get how the public can be so dumb that in hundreds of
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.040]  financial papers I know you read a max they're bragging how they conquered the
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.740]  world the bankers run everything ha ha ha they get on the shows and I've heard
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:08.760]  them talk about Europe how they're taken down one one country after another and
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.480]  how they're even gonna get rid of the sports teams that are named after
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.640]  countries and name them after mascots because that's too nationalistic and they
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.480]  say doesn't matter what Europe tries or Japan will just hold them hostage and
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.560]  they snicker and giggle it's like a criminal group parading around did you
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.400]  see that that Israel lobby guy if everybody knows folks I don't get into
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:32.560]  this nationalistic you know hate Israel love Israel stuff all these countries
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.400]  are corrupt and out of control but he got up there last week on C-span and
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.160]  then and then they put it on their website they're proud of it and said we
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.120]  need to stage a Gulf of Tonkin or another event to start a war with Iran to
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:53.400]  blame it on them and and I mean why brag about committing crimes on TV is this
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:58.600]  just them letting us know that that that there's no end to it I mean will they
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  start you know will the government start barbecuing children I mean that's
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.040]  about all they haven't done yet in front of us or something well you have
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:11.960]  interesting developments at the highest levels for example Sheila bear it was the
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:18.840]  former top regulator at the FDIC she just came out with a big book and media
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:24.720]  tour where she says that the entire tarp program remember during 2008 with Hank
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:30.520]  Paulson was designed only to bail out city bank there was no economic
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:35.600]  justification for it the crisis have been fabricated to hide the fact that you
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:39.280]  know it's kind of a financial false flag to hide the fact the city group was
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.040]  insolvent so they needed to be bailed out so now you have Sheila and she names
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.840]  Tim Geithner as the villain in the piece so now you got two very high level
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.360]  people who are at war very publicly so I think the difference now between even
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.280]  six months ago or even maybe even three months ago is that the very top insiders
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.440]  even people who identify themselves as republic and are conservative are
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.560]  coming out and attacking people like the Tim Geithner's who on your show with
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.520]  people like myself or Salente you know we've been talking about Tim Geithner
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.600]  for several years now as be coming from the New York Fed who then ends up as a
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.640]  Treasury Secretary who got a direct line to Bob Rubin former Goldman Sachs guy
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.400]  who then was the Treasury with Alan Greenspan you know that click of
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:28.840]  insiding banking guys and now there is a war happening at the very top echelons
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.760]  because there is no solution let me let me break it down another way which I
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.160]  can't take credit for I read this on another site but I think it's really
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:43.200]  really smart typically there's two ways to approach economic fixes you've got
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.600]  the Keynesian model where you go into deficit spending and then you have this
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.680]  Milton Friedman model where you're printing money
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:55.000]  monetarism in this crisis you've got historic excesses on both sides you've
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.440]  got the most deficit spending by any country in the history of the world
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.880]  already happening in the US and you also have the most money printing of any
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.800]  country in the history of the world they're doing these two things
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:13.160]  simultaneously at historic levels and yes they just came out of the report
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.080]  saying that the GDP estimate for the next quarter has been revised down to
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:24.320]  less than 1.5 percent less than 1.5 percent means the economy is at stall
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.400]  speed you know stall speed means that if you're out if you're in an airplane
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.720]  you have to go a certain speed or the plane falls to the ground an economy
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:38.120]  needs at least 1.5 percent growth to stay aloft to escape just a complete
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:43.400]  another collapse it's now drifting below that 1.5 percent stall speed which
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.960]  indicates as I've been saying now and I'm holding to my prediction over the
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:52.160]  next 28 weeks of hyperinflation currency collapse gold and silver skyrocketing
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:58.280]  but I guess what I'm saying here is now finally the big McGill is the 800
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:02.840]  pound gorillas in the room that the big regulators are attacking Geithner and
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:07.360]  now the war is really beginning in earnest at the top and the highest
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.880]  level yeah that's what tells me the big implosion is coming max is because when
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.360]  they start blaming each other which they never want to do because they want to
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.960]  keep everybody you know snowed under so the thieving can can happen it looks
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:24.120]  like they want to give Geithner or or or Bernanke the hand grenade when the
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:32.440]  chair stop is my instincts right on that yeah well I think that exactly is a
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:38.280]  case where they realize that nothing is working and they're looking for scapegoats
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:45.120]  and they they can't the public has had it the public can't be can't squeeze the
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.760]  public anymore especially in these European countries or you've already
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.080]  impoverished them they're on the streets and they're they're they're
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:57.160]  scrounging for food do you can't twist that turnip anymore the US already has
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:01.880]  record unemployment record numbers of food stamps record number of poverty
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:05.400]  rates there's there's only there's not much more you can squeeze out of out of
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:09.920]  the US population so they have to they're admitting failure at this point
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.560]  and they're going after each other and this is predictable and as I think I
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:20.360]  agree with you that it is a clear sign that the timeline is now compressing to
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:27.040]  a very near horizon well all I know is government is running around digging in
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:33.640]  buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammo armored vehicles wheeled tanks deploying
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:39.800]  warrior vehicles Bradley's caches of them both in the news and my sources are
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.360]  saying yeah no they're gearing up for absolute bedlam now I'm not saying this
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.040]  is absolutely gonna happen because they can always come up with new scams new
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:52.680]  tricks they may start a big war which somehow puts this off I mean I don't know
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.280]  I just know there's no right now it's a currency war and to get back to what
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.280]  we're saying a little a little bit earlier in the you see what's happening in
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:05.520]  the euro zone all the bad debts for these countries are being swapped for
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.200]  central bank paper but of course that means this new central bank has been
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.760]  created starts life stillborn it starts life dead on arrival and needs to be
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.120]  bailed out by well who's gonna bail out the euro zone there's only one possible
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:23.280]  way now we need to create a global reserve bank and we've talked about
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.080]  this before and then you're gonna have the global reserve bank swapping all
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.840]  the bad debt in Europe along with the bad debt in Japan and then levy all these
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:36.400]  carbon taxes and cigarette taxes on us you have to pay a global tax just like
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.360]  you pay federal state local tax you have to pay a global tax to support the
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.120]  global reserve bank to pay for the maintenance of these debts that are
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.680]  being rolled up into this they said it at Davos three years ago they want to
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:53.840]  create a new facility that's 100 trillion dollars in funding to absorb the
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.200]  global debt that well how they're gonna pay for that unless you exert a global
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:02.040]  tax to pay for that and we see it last week with the introduction of a global
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:07.480]  cigarette max max I mean again the bankers brag that they've captured
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.160]  Europe they've captured America they're gonna shut down free speech they're
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.320]  gonna take over the web they're gonna arrest whoever they want this is the
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:18.600]  sickening plan but simultaneously they have the Southern Primary Law Center ADL
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:24.680]  FBI and Nightline and MSNBC saying anyone that says mega banks are setting up
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.800]  world government is evil and horrible and it doesn't exist how are they gonna
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.400]  juxtapose the two because as you pointed out over a year ago it's on screen now
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.880]  we played the clips here London Telegraph world needs 100 trillion more
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:44.760]  credit says world economic form but they mean 100 trillion to them and then
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.480]  we've got to back it up with our taxes how do they expect Pete to get away with
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.440]  this much because sure they've got the prostitute media max but not for long I
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:00.720]  mean they use the same tactic they use in 2008 Hank Paulson showed how to do
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.640]  it you threatened martial law and that gave him member three quarters of a
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.680]  trillion dollars to bail out city group according to Sheila bear just as
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.560]  past week he threatened martial law that's now in the public record with a
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.920]  originally Congress rejected it the next day they crashed the market how do
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:19.560]  they crash the market as I've explained on your show many times markets are not
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  driven by price discovery where buyers and sellers come together to establish
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:27.920]  a mutually beneficial price no computers create a price first and then the
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:32.760]  volume comes in later to make it look like that price was natural organic they
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.600]  are manipulating the price so they simply pick a price which is 20 or 30%
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.760]  below the closing price from the day before they turn the computers on and
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:45.360]  the market crashes they call it a flash crash they call it we're gonna hold his
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.040]  hostage stay there and finish up on that now let me put you on the spot here max

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:13.200]  max what do you expect I want you to finish your world government comment
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:17.720]  what do you expect because the globalist only want to have the welfare hordes
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:21.320]  you know at first you know to vote for the big governments they can have them
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:25.760]  as a threat to riot as Paulson threatened Congress he said the welfare
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.000]  people will burn the cities of the ground blood will run in the streets tanks
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.800]  will be in the streets that's congressional testimony I'm paraphrasing
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.240]  it but that's almost word for word you're right they've got the gun to our
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:40.160]  head they brag about it on Bloomberg I've heard them many times on those
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.360]  roundtable shows with the heads of big companies laughing and I guess that's
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:48.400]  the downfall of criminals is they love to brag when I was a kid I'd watch you
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.220]  know old movies about criminals old black and white movies like Humphrey
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:56.080]  Bogart and stuff and think oh criminals don't brag to the guy they're about to
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.880]  kill criminals don't and the more I learn as an adult I go wow these movies are
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.120]  actually how things are because because I've noticed criminals love to brag what
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:12.560]  is that max and what do you expect the welfare crowds to do you know if their
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:18.080]  check gets hyperinflated or they're you know their welfare card still has the
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.040]  credits put on it but won't buy anything anymore I mean what do you expect to
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:30.320]  unfold well we see it happening in in Europe and as I said before it's gonna
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.120]  happen in the US but it's being delayed because the US has a world reserve
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:37.440]  currency which means at the moment food and energy prices are not as high as
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.400]  they are in these other countries you know once food gets to 40% or more of
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.360]  your budget you tend to have a revolution that's what we had in Cairo and
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.960]  that's what we had across the north of Africa and historically that's the
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.680]  number to look for right now in America food is about 15 16% of the budget of the
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:58.600]  average household it's creeping up every day and once it gets to 40% look out
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:05.640]  for a major uprising I think once you ask it's over 650 to $7 a gallon would
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:10.720]  also be a major trigger point which would stir but it's gonna be but it's
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.420]  gonna be a uprising for Obama phones as the problem if the welfare classes
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:20.560]  aren't asking for freedom or jobs or industry they're asking for more welfare
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:25.680]  it's just gonna be a hell of a situation it's just gonna be as chaos I don't
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:31.960]  think there's gonna be a real strong you know movement and organization that's
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:37.200]  going to affect the regime change it's gonna be a mob and there's gonna be out
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:41.520]  of control and it's gonna be nasty I agree with you stay there Max Kaiser
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.320]  dot-com we're going to take your phone calls and before he leaves I'm gonna ask
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.600]  him again just in 60 seconds what will the collapse look like I mean if it

[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:47.800]  research it first and I would personally buy gold and silver at bullion prices
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:52.160]  you know 1% 2% above spot is all you should be paying because obviously we're
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.840]  capitalist whoever's handling it's got to make a little bit of money take
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.760]  Midas resources they make their money by buying when it's low hoarding it in
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:05.640]  vaults and then when gold goes up they sell it at discounted prices but then
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.880]  are able to make a profit because gold has gone up gold and silver like they're
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:12.640]  in a big profit phase right now thank God because they fund the network and
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:19.920]  are great guys but that's how that works but anything else sir can I can I
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.080]  can I can I talk about my new silver products sure max I've got a new one
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:31.360]  ounce silver Kaiser it just lost a couple a week ago and the thing about this
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:34.640]  new silver Kaiser it's a one ounce coin it says global insurrection against
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:40.720]  banker occupation this is made with 100% recycled silver and this is important
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.160]  because there's a lot of silver out there that's not accounted for and we
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:48.040]  want to get it off the market as quickly as possible so we want to get the
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.400]  demand for this up and listen max you know by the way you know you know the
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:57.160]  big cardinal rule is obviously I have my gold and silver sponsor you do what you
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.480]  do but you're what your thing is so important about busting JP Morgan you've
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:05.200]  got to talk to Ted Anderson at Midas resources he carries all sorts of
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.440]  specialty silver rounds in fact you know what go get Ted right now in here
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.640]  during the break let's let's talk to Kaiser get him get him I'll tell you
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:17.760]  what we'll get him on we'll get him on in the next segment I got to go to calls
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.280]  because I promised go find Ted let's get him on at 20 after we'll talk to Kaiser
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.800]  because I'm telling you we're not commies and I love your silver coin in fact I
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.880]  meant to even months ago when you watch that when I first saw it I wanted I meant
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:35.440]  to call Ted and say hey carry those because we carry the Lakotas everything
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:39.640]  every little specialty goodie and absolutely those go for a lot in the
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:44.200]  aftermarket and I believe in it so we need to get minus resources comm carrying
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:50.800]  Kaiser so that's it for that all right we'll come back I know folks we don't
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:54.560]  make money off government bailouts and stuff we actually you know sell stuff we
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:05:00.320]  believe in it's it's what built America and it's horrible we'll be right back

[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:45.640]  went into effect and how they're actually expecting hyperinflation and
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:49.600]  that they're they're banking on a global war to bring a global currency that I
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:52.040]  told them that about the new world order and he just called me a crazy
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.920]  conspiracy theorist and walked away oh yeah no no they admit it's global
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.360]  government they admit they're tyrannical they admit they're doing all this but

[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.000]  met an army officer who actually interned for Ben Bernanke and then we
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.400]  were just kids talking and he told me about the QE3 and I'm like yeah I know
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:52.280]  a lot about that and he's like yeah there were actually banking on hyperinflation
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:55.360]  I'm like that's horrible he's like if they didn't do this and the banks would go
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:59.920]  under so he basically went on to tell me that they're actually banking on a
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.680]  global war in which they can bring in a global currency and I was like well do
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:06.120]  you believe in the New World Ordering he's like you're afraid you could fear
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:09.680]  stairs and walked away well yeah I mean that's it they bragging all these
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.720]  publications they're conquering us through their fraud and and say oh but
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:16.800]  we don't want you to go under when really it's not they're not going under
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.720]  they're taking over max comments on that okay this is fascinating I will get
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:26.520]  serious for that yeah the quantitative easing announcement they are going to
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:34.000]  buy back billions of mortgage backed securities on a monthly basis here's the
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:40.640]  fact they could quite easily just simply retire the mortgages you see what I'm
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.080]  saying they don't need to bail out the banksters who have this mortgage backed
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:50.320]  securities the derivatives instead of this is what's going on to 2008 every
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:56.280]  time there's a need for some program to come into effect instead of giving
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:01.960]  relief to the actual people by simply they could have gotten paid down 90% of
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:05.160]  all the mortgages in 2008 and that would have cost less than 10 trillion
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.280]  dollars they have spent close to 30 trillion dollars continuing to bail out
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.080]  the banksters and yet the mortgage problem continues to fester and be a
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.520]  problem sure that's the main point people need understand when Bernanke
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:22.560]  speaks he speaks in a way that makes no sense for the average person who has a
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:28.760]  being crushed by this economy he continues to placate the bankers by this
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:34.920]  program QE3 where he's buying their bad debt let's see I have another call here
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.840]  about Scott and Arizona you're on the air with Max Kaiser hey Alex and so my
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:45.640]  first question for you Alex and then the Kaiser right after that did you hear
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.320]  about that the bank robber in Aurora Colorado that they stopped every
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:55.360]  vehicle and took every person out of the vehicle yeah with with with machine
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:59.480]  guns families those months ago families driving up they point machine guns at
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:03.760]  them drug everybody out and it was all just stage that's the new thing we're
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.640]  all prisoners anytime they want and then cops all the time now just shoot
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:10.680]  innocent people and it's like an afterthought they're just getting us
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:16.760]  ready yeah Max Kaiser is well then you have a question for Max go ahead and then
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:22.680]  after the okay so Max you got your time date in April of next year right so my
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:26.640]  question to you is what when that does collapse what are they gonna replace it
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.040]  with what is the actual thing that they're gonna have at that moment when
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.120]  everything comes down how long are we gonna let it run for before they bring
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:36.520]  up their solution and what is that gonna be global government global banks
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.280]  there you go Kaiser answer your question now the currency being considered is
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:47.000]  being propagated by the IMF the International Monetary Fund and it's
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:53.360]  called a special drawing right or SDR they this is going to take the place and
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:59.040]  all of the global transactions will occur on the wholesale level in the SDR
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:04.840]  the dollar will be convertible into the SDR the global currency but at a rate
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:11.200]  that is 70 80% less than what your purchasing power is today so if you
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:17.160]  look up SDR special drawing right it'll give you the whole story about how the
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.520]  IMF which is in its own right a central bank run by Christie Lagarde a globalist
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:27.640]  who is now going to deputize that bank to be part of this new global
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:31.360]  multi trillion dollar facility it'll be priced in this new global currency the
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.480]  SDR game into that and to define globalist it is a world government
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.400]  corporatist crony capitalist anti-free market monopolist who believes in
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.920]  eugenics or the science of taking over society and breeding the public to be
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.840]  servile slaves those that they allow to kill it is to give a quicker definition
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:55.480]  psychopathic control freak social engineers dedicated to scientific total
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:59.520]  war against humanity and mass extermination of at least 90% of the
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:03.880]  world's population in the takeover phase they use economic warfare to dominate
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:07.840]  society then posing as saviors as they collapse the society into their
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:12.440]  reorganization grid which is itself an extermination dumbing down program
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:18.000]  preparing you for the next phase of the operation you didn't write that no I
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.240]  didn't write you didn't write that you didn't write that that's right I didn't
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:29.760]  say that government I did invent the Kaiser all right let's go a fully loaded

[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:20.200]  were police officers with no bad no name tags just badges on their shirt and
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:23.160]  they were undercover police officers that came and basically just started

[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.280]  being crazed is the secret to life you know I don't think you're actually
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:27.800]  intelligent or awake or alive unless you're crazed I've noticed people I
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:31.400]  really like who have high intelligences are crazy as well Max I think you would
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:36.560]  you would describe yourself as crazed wouldn't you is that what seals I know
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:40.200]  something about you gotta be a little crazy gotta be a little crazy you know
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:43.960]  but still song you know that TSA people are everywhere in the world you know it's
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:46.800]  not just the United States you travel anyone in the world now you have the
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:50.280]  same kind of people at every border crossing everywhere in the world it's
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:54.720]  gone global that's an American export well it's the Rand Corporation yeah it's
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:58.920]  a global government program it's continuity of agenda Brian real fast
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:03.400]  question here before I perseverate and cut you off all right cool that's okay
[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:08.440]  I'm a 30 year old college graduate I'm struggling server and server at a
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:12.040]  restaurant and I'm hearing all this talk about investing in golden silver and
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:17.280]  it's looking very unpractical for someone in my situation to invest any
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:21.720]  money that I do have that I'm trying to live off yeah I would invest in I would
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:25.880]  invest in skills that people will need on top of your good degree I would go
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:29.760]  apprentice and work for places you know cuz I know plumbers and people that own
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:32.720]  lawn companies that make more money than most the yuppies you know have college
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:36.480]  degrees not knocking your college degree the point is it is it doesn't exist in
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.720]  the model that's coming it's like it's like a big joke for the global of some
[02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:43.520]  degrees will be at worth but only ever willing to put people in gas chambers
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:49.160]  basically law enforcement type degrees and surveillance and spy degrees but
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:54.360]  you know that's a useful thing I would invest in friends family I would invest
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:58.920]  in being in shape I would invest in lead and I make sure you have firearms Max
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:04.200]  Kaiser quick comment for him well he's not really an investor at all he's somebody
[02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:09.760]  who's working to stay staying stay going and but there's a political side to the
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:13.600]  silver campaign if you just buy one ounce and if a hundred million people
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:17.320]  bought one ounce we would bankrupt J.P. Morgan see there's a political side to
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:21.280]  it it's not is the savings vehicle but if you're not a saver because you're a
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:24.520]  hundred percent worker you have no savings at all it's not a question but
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:28.240]  if you're part of the political movement to put J.P. Morgan out of business then
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:33.880]  you might want to scrape together 35 bucks to buy one ounce all right thank
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:38.000]  you so much I appreciate your call Max Kaiser look forward to talking to you
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.800]  again soon thank you for the time oh it was a pleasure and good luck with that

[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:13.920]  been in 2012 and there's been a little bit of profit taking made it go down a
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:17.080]  little bit in its gains but still big gains for the day gold rallies again on

[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:06.840]  why I've been pushing silver since it was $5 an ounce and gold when it was
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:11.720]  245 260 bucks an ounce and now look at it I don't didn't sell gold when it went
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:15.320]  to 2000 I didn't sell it went down to 1500 because I know they're going the way
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:18.760]  of hyperinflation worldwide in the place to buy your gold and silver not just

[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:05.480]  lot of different deals that are going on right now and you got to realize that
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:11.920]  gold has almost hit $1800 an ounce today 1793 at its peak right that it's seen so
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:17.240]  far today right now currently 1781 30 silver hit a peak today of 3550 it is
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:21.520]  currently trading at 3504 so we are seeing prices that are the highest point
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:27.160]  we've ever seen it this year I should say Ben Bernanke opened his mall today
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:30.760]  and said that savers are going to be in trouble believe it or not the chairman
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:34.000]  of the Federal Reserve Bank is saying that you better get out and tell you
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.760]  this forever max was saying it two weeks ago when he was on you're gonna pay to
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.200]  have money in a bank now and they're gonna charge you $5 every time you use
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:44.400]  the cash card and they're not gonna let you use cash they're gonna take
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:48.200]  everything you got they're gonna totally crush you if you let them they love
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:51.240]  hurting you and your family and I'm sick of people putting up with it dead
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:54.560]  that's why I love golden silver because they hate it when we buy it because
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:58.240]  they're busy buying it all up for their greedy selves excuse me they are they
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:01.160]  are there's no question about it the central banks own a lot of gold and
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.920]  around the world not just the not just medicine not just the United States but
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:09.480]  yeah it's going on you know you we're talking about earlier about how they

[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:31.640]  I know we got a bunch of phone calls sitting here and they wanted to talk to
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:38.400]  Max Kaiser but Max had to Max had to go well he was pretty excited about that
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:49.640]  TSA confection wasn't he oh man I tell ya I don't know what to do anymore I wish
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:53.560]  this wasn't true I wish I wasn't right believe me people but I'm right I'm
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:58.200]  about as right as you're gonna find that mean I have all the answers let's take a
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:02.100]  few calls right to these news reports and then that's some other news let's
[02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:10.720]  talk to Bob and Tennessee at listing on 1600 a.m. w.m. q.m. one of our fabulous
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:17.760]  affiliates here on the air Bob welcome yeah my family and my friends would all
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:23.880]  say I'm crazed so I would just say get crazed info wars.com that's right I have
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:28.520]  a question for Max Kaiser but I think I could probably ask you just as well okay
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:40.440]  um if as he predicts the landslide will hit us economically in April would that
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:48.000]  eliminate the threat of the police state if it hits us that soon no again he
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:53.120]  never fully defines it and he calls a collapse basically something twice as
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:59.000]  bad as what happened in 08 you know half the stock market down and and then the
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:05.240]  inflation starts I mean he calls the collapse the doorway entering into the
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:10.520]  caddy Wampus event so I mean it's still a process because the globalist gobble
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:14.640]  things like a predator a lion doesn't go out and eat all the gazelles at once it
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:19.160]  grabs one and then grabs another it's like crocodiles do that so this is kind
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:23.040]  of surreal killer psychology where they pick us off one at a time I mean that's
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:27.920]  how they operate but you know at a certain point even if it's incremental at
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:31.240]  a certain point you you know you're pretty darn deep into the tyranny I
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:35.560]  mean I don't know if Max is right it's just it's you know Dr. Paul Greg Roberts
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:39.960]  who's always said it'll be a gradual collapse he's saying yeah things are
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:43.320]  accelerating he said like three years ago he said about three years would be
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:46.240]  when he starts saying look for a real huge collapse and now we're starting to
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:51.840]  get close to that I mean everybody I talk to but I research things myself I
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:56.640]  I don't just look at the economics I look at the preparations the police the
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:01.240]  digging in the the conditioning the preparations for terror attacks which
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:05.800]  they'll stage to pose as saviors I mean I look at a constellation of other data
[02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:09.800]  that a lot of these economic guys don't and I see what they're saying from
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:14.320]  another perspective and it just doesn't look good and it just makes me sick the
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:17.200]  globalists are doing this to run everything I mean they're already in
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:21.640]  control but they really want to hurt people they really want to bankrupt us
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:27.840]  they really want to make us poor so they can totally tell us what to do and
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:31.440]  they're gonna tell the public raise taxes which they know actually brings in
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:35.520]  less receipts you know write more tickets more fines more fees which is
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.280]  meant to extinct economic activity that they don't control because they're
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:45.040]  exempt from everything the globalists remember are exempt from 99% of the
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:49.640]  garbage they put on us so so so they they freeze us and make us move in slow
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:53.440]  motion economically and they're like the flash you know running around the world
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.880]  five times in you know two seconds I mean they literally it's like in fact
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:02.880]  we're not even moving it's like we're we're we're frozen and they've got the
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:08.160]  whole world you know to them one minute is like a thousand years and that's why
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:14.840]  they're able to get away with all this okay um I heard Paul Kurt Roberts last
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:22.320]  week in an interview on your show say that describing the financial collapse
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:27.600]  and say he said you won't have to worry about a police state and that's where my
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:31.240]  question comes from I understand you well now he says yeah and he's with
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.520]  somebody who's well you're right I mean it could be just absolute total are
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:42.600]  beyond Argentina and then the cops are gonna and the bureaucrats and all of them
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.560]  are gonna be fending for themselves and boy that happens Katie bar the door I
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:52.280]  mean Homeland Security is running TV ads and print ads about zombie apocalypse
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:56.960]  using the archetype of the of the public without without their you know
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:03.880]  electricity and power and gas and food as zombies and there's a reason within
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:09.040]  ten days in major Pentagon studies you can pull up just typing government
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:13.040]  Pentagon studies on on civilization collapse you can there's a bunch of
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:18.560]  studies but most studies show within nine to ten days almost everyone about
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:25.480]  98% of people will kill you for everything you've got within 15 days
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:33.080]  over 90% it's about 91% become cannibals within 15 days what happens to the
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:40.000]  other 9% 8% they commit suicide generally or die fighting the cannibals if
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.120]  you want to know what this will look like watch the movie the road if one of
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:48.920]  their anti-matter bombs goes off in one of their bunkers or or if the power goes
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:53.760]  off and the reactors blow up 407 of a mortal wide if any of that kind of
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:58.640]  stuff happens go watch VE go Mordensen's the road that is exactly what
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.080]  people act like except the book that was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:09.560]  the book on that actually has them roasting babies on spits so 90% become
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:16.480]  cannibals eight nine percent commit suicide and that's what happens so not a
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:20.840]  very nice situation yeah that's why Homeland Security is branding the
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:25.400]  general public as cannibals as zombies because the average yuppie down the
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:31.040]  street it's totally trend total trender that that person will act like a zombie
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:35.320]  from a horror movie within 15 days of the type of road war collapse you're
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:42.360]  talking about our best bet is simply to plan for that scenario and let the rest
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:46.280]  of it fall where it will yeah because government's so decadent I mean the
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:51.600]  Nazis were evil but they were focused in professional the the the elites we have
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:54.120]  in their minions are pretty cowardly at the end of the day because they never
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:58.880]  face armies they mainly just pick on people all day you know here domestically
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.240]  show they're going to try to organize going through the countryside looting
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.320]  everybody for their goods to feed themselves but that will burn out and
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:10.400]  stop pretty quick if it ever goes to that red level which I don't think it
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:17.720]  will but I mean it will just be absolute zombie apocalypse if there's a total
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:22.560]  collapse see Kaiser's total collapse is different than than a total collapse of
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:27.080]  what I consider a total collapse he means the financial system splintering and
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:31.400]  collapsing a bunch down but not a full collapse but who knows they're
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:35.680]  engineering the whole thing look they plan on a giant world war to get this
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:39.640]  world government they plan on billions to die if they're crazy enough to pull
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:46.400]  the trigger they are well I mean all I know is I hope all you enjoy it the
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:52.440]  service system because my god you have no idea what your buck's turn was 99% of
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:55.880]  the minions of this that think they're powerful that get off on being of the
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:01.880]  black wings of the New World Order you know they have no idea what what they've
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:05.960]  signed on to and they think it's all cute and funny you know the TSA thinks you
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:09.920]  know TSA agents robbing a million bucks out of people one guy that they think
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:14.080]  it's all cutesy and funny they're gonna find out I mean they're gonna find out
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:18.040]  anyways I appreciate your call sir let's go to Dan Baddandy's report here
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:22.360]  this is a really good report he and David Ortiz went down there to the end the
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:26.120]  Fed last week and I heard this on the nightly news 7 o'clock every night in
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.400]  full wars news.com there's a 15-day free trial there on the site I don't even
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:34.680]  care if you go sign up and then cancel it in 15 days that's fine one
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:38.160]  membership's $5.95 a month it's really six memberships we need to get a press
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:40.680]  release out on that explaining it because each username and passcode you
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:43.080]  create needs to be just for the site because then you can share it with
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:46.400]  friends and family six people can be logged in simultaneously on one so
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:49.280]  that's a dollar a month or less than a dollar a month per per member at
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:52.600]  prisonplanet.tv and then you fund us trying to stop this collapse from
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:56.800]  happening and I'm sorry we get a little punch drunk from in full war fatigue and
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:00.680]  go kind of crazy but hey so what it's good to get outside the box just flail
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:06.240]  around let people know how serious things are but I think we can avert all
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:10.480]  this release back it down to a certain extent but here's Dan Baddandy talking
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:14.800]  to the people protesting and they're totally informed and then he goes and
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:18.400]  talks to the general public and none of them knew anything except for two of the
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.680]  people heard him talking to someone else and heard him inform them so so so so
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:27.160]  actually no one we talked to on the street outside of the in the fed
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:31.400]  protesters knew that a private bank runs the country and then this is your
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:35.280]  enemy this is running the whole takeover so we've got to identify them you know
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:39.200]  it I mean at least the French knew the Nazis had occupied them or people in
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:42.480]  Romania knew the Soviets had occupied them or East Germans knew the Soviets
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:45.640]  had occupied them I mean here people don't even know they've been occupied so
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:51.120]  here's that report and then more news and your calls coming up here this hi
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:55.080]  Dan Baddandy in San Antonio Texas standing on a property we used to be
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:59.080]  called the Federal Reserve we're live out of protest and what we're gonna do
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:02.720]  today is we're gonna ask the people in the protest with the government calls
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:06.560]  terrorist and conspiracy theorists we're gonna question and knowledge on the
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.720]  Federal Reserve then later we're gonna go over to the Alamo and question the
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:15.400]  general public on the same questions about the Federal Reserve hi I want to
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:18.640]  ask you five questions on the Federal Reserve one what is the Federal Reserve
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:24.640]  the Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel that has the a charter to issue
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.240]  America's money through debt to our Treasury Department it's a government
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:32.480]  created cartel we got a bunch of bankers together so they can print paper and
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:36.400]  steal our wealth the Federal Reserve is a private for-profit bank that was
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:42.880]  started up in 1913 the Federal Reserve is actually not federal at all its
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:49.200]  origins are as per the 1913 law which was put through Congress on miraculously a
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:53.760]  day when part of most of Congress probably 80% of Congress was absent and
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:59.440]  it was pushed through as legislation in order to guard our hedge against an
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:03.480]  economic depression of the type that we had prior the Federal Reserve is a
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:10.400]  private institution that prints money usually not for interests as Americans
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:15.840]  more for foreign banks and and I'd like to say the establishment's agenda what
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.160]  they do is like I said they print money that's backed by nothing they raise
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:22.840]  inflation rates they raise the cost of living for the middle class private
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:26.680]  international banking cartel basically is a private banking institution that
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:31.920]  was founded in 1913 and it basically controls our money and you just answered
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:36.000]  all three of the first three questions and what year was the Federal Reserve
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.600]  established in the United States the Federal Reserve Charter was established
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:47.280]  on December 23rd 1913 1913 one of those 13 unlucky number years 1913 1913 I
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:51.640]  believe it was established in 1913 it's the Federal Reserve a federal or
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:55.920]  private company it's a private banking cartel definitely private it's a
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:59.800]  private company a bunch of bankers private corporation very much private
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.800]  contrary to most people's belief just because it says federal is not is not a
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.480]  federal entity at all it's a private corporation and recently the Fed announced
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:14.080]  QE3 what is QE3 QE3 is well it's basically money debasement through the
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:20.000]  institution of 40 billion dollars a month through the toxic mortgage assets
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  department that's going to be pumped into the American economy it's where
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.280]  they're going to print a bunch more bucks that are going to devalue the money
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:30.920]  you got out here already the implementation of more fiat money into
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:35.880]  the money system that will devalue the dollar as it stands as Bernanke has
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:41.560]  announced QE3 is actually going to be producing or in or pumping 40 billion
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:46.480]  dollars worth of money into the economy every month as quantitative easing I
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.080]  believe they're gonna start the process of printing even more money more money
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:52.760]  than more money they've already been printing and I guess that it's gonna
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:57.200]  only start to raise inflation rates it's basically their failed strategy to try
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:01.520]  and ease the economic downturn that we're seeing in the devaluation of the
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:06.160]  dollar and final question could you name two of the three major banking families
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:09.880]  that were at Jekyll Island that helped push the Federal Reserve this year
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:13.600]  with the course there is the Morgan's and the Rothschild's let's see there's
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:18.280]  the shift family the Warburgs the Rockefellers well there would be the
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:24.160]  Rothschild family banking and that would be let's see JP Morgan I believe is
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:31.560]  also owned by the by the Queen for the Rockefellers I believe what I'm thinking
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:36.440]  the Rothschilds yeah the Red Skulls which go by the Rothschild family JP
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:42.760]  Morgan Roth the Rothschilds definitely Morgan as in Chase Morgan Bank we just
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:46.840]  moved over to the Alamo now we're gonna ask the general public the same
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:52.360]  questions we asked the people at the end the fed rally hi can you tell me what
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:48:01.080]  the Federal Reserve is no I cannot no and not at the moment yes the central
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:09.240]  banks it's the bank for the government it's a bank bank of unity did you know
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:23.520]  what year they were established 1920 1800s around 1840 well now I do 1913 no I
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:30.280]  do not think was it 1913 or 1915 1913 yep it's the Federal Reserve private or
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:39.200]  federal federal private federal it's a federal but it's private banks you
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:45.320]  would figure it's federal but more likely it's private federal recently the
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:49.120]  federal government now it's QE3 it's all over the news QE3 do you know what
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:57.120]  that is I do not allowed a bull no no actually I don't I have no idea I
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:02.240]  haven't heard of QB3's yet last question can you name two of the three major
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:05.680]  banking families that were at Jekyll Island that helped push along the
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.440]  Federal Reserve in the United States I couldn't answer that one I'll give you
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:15.400]  one the rocker fellas like I said I couldn't give you any of them I don't
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:25.560]  know actually I do not know Lynch Merrill and I don't know I we see that's
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:30.800]  right I cannot with a rocker fellas and raw child and as you can see folks the
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:36.040]  terrorist protesters we interviewed are smarter than the general public when it
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:39.560]  comes to the Federal Reserve and this is Dan Badan you're a partner for the
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:45.280]  info wars nightly news well good job Dan and you can watch that video up at

[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:27.280]  but bankers coming in fraudsters that that's how we've been conquered and over
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:30.560]  100 years ago the US Banking Association it was a book written on it I've seen
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:34.520]  the documents said people are too smart it's like an 1898 they said we've got to
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:38.560]  buy up all the newspapers and dump people down because see back then it was
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:42.720]  cool to know how to read and it was cool to be informed and all people did was
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:47.080]  obsessed over politics and get real angry and the official sport was battling
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:50.880]  the government that's why Americans were different everybody marveled at us so
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:53.880]  they took us over dumbed us down but fluoride in our water and we are now

[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:30.000]  hey we're gonna get Gary Johnson on the show a letter this week and we're gonna
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:39.320]  have a debate sometime during the week about hey do you do you go and vote for
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:44.640]  Gary Johnson or right in Ron Paul and then the Barack Obama gets in because
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:48.840]  you could say you're protesting the left-right paradigm and that you're you
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:53.760]  know protesting the two-party system the one-party monopoly but actually you're
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:58.560]  just in the two-party system gonna put Barack Obama in and I'm not saying but
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:01.640]  that's necessarily the end of the world because maybe things will even
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:05.640]  accelerate more I mean do you think people are gonna put up with Obama
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:09.480]  continuing another four years because Mitt Rom is gonna try the same stuff it's
[02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:13.600]  just that he'll have some street cred because he's new for a while it'll take
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:18.080]  time to expose him the question is do you want Obama do you want Romney and
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:20.800]  it does become pick your poison we're gonna be talking about that later in
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:24.680]  the week here's some excerpts of like a 30-minute in-studio interview that David
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:28.360]  Ortiz one of our great reporters did on the info wars nightly news in studio
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:31.400]  last week I thought I'd play a few of these comments that Johnson said that I
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:35.920]  think are well-newsmaking here they are this is a bill that the American public
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:39.720]  should be concerned about this and the Patriot Act the further or the
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:44.840]  constant furthering erosion of our civil liberties and this is happening in a
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:49.560]  very insidious way the National Defense Authorization Act look we fought wars
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:55.960]  over the government not being able to arrest you or I and hold us detain us
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:59.840]  without being charged I think this is fundamental to the United States
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:05.000]  Constitution I think it's fundamental to why we have fought wars tell us about
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.240]  the lawsuit and why you decided to file it well we will be filing a number of
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:13.880]  lawsuits actually we filed the first of what are going to be three but the first
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:20.120]  one was on antitrust grounds who are they and why are they able to restrict
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:24.960]  who doesn't or does get into the debates they are a private organization and
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.800]  they're made up of Democrats and Republicans so they have no vested
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:32.960]  interest whatsoever in seeing a third party on the debate stage they were
[02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:38.200]  set up after Ross Perot really to prevent a Ross Perot from ever being on
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:41.920]  stage again how would you handle the Iranian crisis well I would not bomb
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:48.360]  Iran I don't think there is a military threat from Iran and if we bomb Iran in
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.080]  my opinion we're gonna find ourselves with another hundred million enemies to
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:57.280]  this country that but for that bombing would not would not otherwise occur
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:01.720]  let's not forget that after 9-11 the largest demonstration in the world in
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.560]  support of the United States was in Iran and where and million million
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:10.320]  supporters show up million demonstrators show up in support of the
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:14.480]  United States and we're gonna bomb the citizens of Iran look our beef is with
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:17.920]  Ahmadinejad but it shouldn't involve bombing if I were president of the
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:23.360]  United States right now I would urge Israel to not be bombing Iran if we
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:28.240]  don't want them to get a nuclear weapon let's let's consider the notion of free
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:34.240]  trade as opposed to embargo I would I would sign legislation abolishing the
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:39.080]  Federal Reserve I think it's an inside game the Federal Reserve takes money from
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:45.080]  Treasury they loan it to the banks they take money from the Treasury Treasury
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:50.160]  prints the money Federal Reserve gives it to the banks at 0% interest banks
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:54.320]  don't loan that money out to you or I they buy up treasuries in a closed loop
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.280]  all right look at it this is Bernie Madoff I mean the the full interview is
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:02.880]  up at info wars.com but I've got to say I agree with that everything he said the
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:06.440]  issue is okay well we don't want to Ross Perot because that got Bill Clinton in
[02:58:06.440 --> 02:58:12.280]  but really it would have been George Herbert Walker Bush you see and and so
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:16.640]  why can't we ever have more parties in there but then yes it will probably if
[02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:20.280]  he gets in the debates he will probably deliver the White House to Barack
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.960]  Obama you know what I don't even know what to say about this a few things make
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:28.680]  my head spin I just know my gut is right it's all stage at that level and that's
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:31.800]  why Gary Johnson's gonna be shut out I don't think he'll be in the debates but

[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:44.600]  all I had a question for a max car here and then one for you for max I was
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:50.960]  wondering how do I how do I go about to get the information around here in
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:54.280]  Portland Oregon because this is just obama phobia around here everyone's just
[03:01:54.280 --> 03:02:00.000]  QE3 is good QE4 is good GMO is good Obama is good but you know what can I do
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  around here to show people the facts so I said to the mayor should I send it to Sam
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:09.400]  Adams she said it was okay but for I don't know what should I do yeah well
[03:02:09.400 --> 03:02:13.480]  you're a nanny sage central there I would just keep looking for people that
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:17.600]  want to be woken up I wear an info wars.com shirt out in public you'll
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:21.800]  find like-minded people and get together because the sheep only listen to
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:26.920]  authority and crowds even whether what whether what the government saying is
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:29.520]  true or a lie they act like they're authoritative so you have to be
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:33.920]  authoritative with the info and just discredit the system so people know the
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:38.680]  globalist engineered this so they can't pose a savior it's Mike great point great
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:45.100]  question let's go ahead and talk to blue in Iowa blue you're on the air hey
[03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:48.760]  Alex how you doing good my friend hey I was wondering if you'd heard about
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:54.640]  Romney's plan to take away federal student loans and go privatized I know
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:58.680]  that that's that's well I'm for real privatization but not taking existing
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:03.400]  roads and putting a toll road on them or just letting private interest do what
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:06.400]  government's already doing because that's just a private interest now
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:10.400]  becoming the government and that's why the the Bilderbergs and others are
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:14.960]  funding so much the libertarian movement now because they want to co-opt it and
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:20.880]  turn it into something different. Also I was wondering about you were talking
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:23.680]  about investing in lead and stuff I was wondering if copper would be a worthy
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:28.480]  investment. Yeah well I mean there is copper jacketing on lead I just the you
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:33.440]  know the common nomenclature for bullets is lead but yeah no I think copper is
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:39.140]  great full metal jacket I mean obviously most rifle rounds if not all of them are
[03:03:39.140 --> 03:03:46.880]  jacketed and luscious lead is covered with the jacket the full metal jacket.
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:50.800]  Talk about lead bullion because I know it's reloading you know some of these bigger
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:54.560]  reloaders use lead bullion I was wondering if maybe there's copper bullion
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:57.920]  you can invest in for you know lower cost for those of us that you know are kind
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:02.400]  of well I mean all the commodities are generally going to go up as the dollars
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:06.040]  devalued so yeah I mean I'm not going to double what I I'll tell you what I would
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:09.120]  do I'm not going to say what you should do I mean it's real simple do I take a
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:14.880]  sponsor I buy it try it and then promote it I mean it's real simple that's how we
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:19.000]  fund ourselves it's like if I like it if I believe in it every day I have you know
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:24.120]  a different sponsor opportunities where it's some vitamin thing that claims it
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:27.120]  does this or that and if I haven't tried it if it hadn't worked I'm not going to
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:31.200]  promote it you know and that's the highest moral standard by the way most
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:35.680]  talk radio and news they will take in the ad that comes in as long as it's not
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:40.440]  anti-establishment I appreciate your call I would invest in getting on your
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:44.640]  knees before God and asking God to heal this country in this world I know a lot
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:48.160]  of you don't believe in God whatever a focus on trying to make the world a
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:51.640]  better place take some time out to get focused I mean I do that all the time
[03:04:51.640 --> 03:04:55.520]  then I get on air and blow up it's kind of an anomaly I don't really blow up
[03:04:55.520 --> 03:05:02.760]  much outside of work and then all I do is blow up here but hey whatever
