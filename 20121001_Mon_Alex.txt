[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.875]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.457]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:12.998]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:17.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:21.266]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:57.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just ranting and raving before I even went on air here about the state of our world and the state of zombie-ism that is now poleaxing much of the public, where the public is even unable to tie their shoelaces or communicate with each other.
[00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:02.065]  The language is being shrunken, less and less words are being used.
[00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.627]  Even mainstream media admits that.
[00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.716]  The health of the population is degenerating very, very quickly.
[00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.079]  I have a CBS article here.
[00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:12.480]  Study.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.027]  Baby boomers' health very poor, getting worse, deteriorating fast.
[00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:20.191]  Absolute, total, and complete insanity.
[00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:40.398]  Is where this society is going because we have become a nation but also a planet of industrialized jellyfish that watch television all day and do not live in the real world and just kind of shuffle around aimlessly.
[00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:48.462]  Pretty soon they'll probably have to mount everyone with artificial respirators because people will be too lazy to suck air into their lungs.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.483]  And of course I know that that's brainstem controlled and that that's supposedly automatic.
[00:01:53.483 --> 00:02:00.089]  But I predict breathing will soon become government-assisted.
[00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:05.394]  And it'll be a conspiracy theory that we were ever able to breathe on our own.
[00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:08.029]  I'm serious.
[00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.589]  I'm serious.
[00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:26.512]  Don't think the globalists won't release a virus to eat areas of the brainstem that control breathing, respiration, and then shell us little microchips to implant in that area of the brainstem, but of course it'll have back doors that then control us.
[00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:35.334]  By the way, I'm not even being satirical at this point, because things have gotten so crazy that the wildest satire is now reality.
[00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:38.428]  Okay, here's what we got going on today.
[00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:41.556]  If you're listening to us on the radio, well, thank you for tuning in.
[00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.819]  That's about 95% of our audience.
[00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:55.373]  But there are PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, and there are folks that are going to be watching this later on YouTube and hundreds of other video channels, millions and millions a week.
[00:02:55.373 --> 00:03:08.358]  You'll notice last night and today there's going to be documents, articles, and our guests joining us via video, but we're putting in new sound doors and new equipment and things in this studio, so it's a bit disheveled.
[00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:15.605]  And it should be done by tomorrow or so, so you will not be tortured by Pumpkinhead.
[00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.708]  Quite literally, a pumpkin-headed creature.
[00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:24.915]  Alright, I am going to settle down because I was running around in circles yelling and screaming right before I went on air.
[00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:26.477]  Trying to get air back into my lungs.
[00:03:28.137 --> 00:03:35.326]  I've been spending like three weeks just trying to get Paul Watson, who changed his phone numbers, his name on the phone list.
[00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:43.156]  See, to be a manager, and we have a great career by the way, they just do incredible jobs, but it's like little things, like organization and stuff like that.
[00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.621]  It becomes an issue, and I don't think we'll ever be in contact with Watson again.
[00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:51.322]  In fact, that's probably the end of Paul Watson.
[00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:53.984]  Never hear him again on the show, never talk to him again.
[00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:54.885]  I mean, I have his number.
[00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:56.185]  I talk to him, but that'll be it.
[00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:57.746]  You never see Watson again.
[00:03:57.746 --> 00:03:59.467]  It's all over.
[00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:03.970]  And I'll have to communicate with Steve Watson here over the airwaves.
[00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.312]  It's the only way to get through to him.
[00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.793]  That's kind of the modern society.
[00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:09.674]  That's how people manage you.
[00:04:09.674 --> 00:04:10.654]  You don't manage them.
[00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:18.800]  And again, the respiration will soon have to be well government-aided.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.265]  That said, I do have a lot of anger issues, frustration issues, that are of course quite evident.
[00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:33.211]  And start your engines, because we will officially launch the transmission out of the gates when we return after this quick break.
[00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:39.637]  And it is a big Mac Daddy kahuna of a broadcast today.
[00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:46.939]  You had better believe that this is going to be a radio show that you are not going to want to miss.
[00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.901]  You know, it feels so much more intimate to not have the bright lights on in here or to have all the cameras on me.
[00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:54.081]  Feels like old radio.
[00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:58.403]  I'm almost tempted to just pull the cameras out of here because it's so liberating.
[00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.343]  Aaron Fullin here.
[00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:12.956]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:16.780]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.761]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:27.644]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:35.147]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[00:05:35.447 --> 00:05:36.568]  But here's some good news.
[00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:42.794]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[00:05:42.794 --> 00:05:46.117]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[00:05:46.117 --> 00:05:48.960]  For more information check out fermentationfactor.com.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.982]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:57.108]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:59.831]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:07.007]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:09.609]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:14.994]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:19.678]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:27.601]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:31.463]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:06:31.463 --> 00:06:33.263]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:06:33.263 --> 00:06:37.285]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:39.886]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:42.948]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[00:06:42.948 --> 00:06:47.530]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.170]  Don't wait!
[00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.052]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:03.919]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.701]  But not all silver is equal.
[00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:12.445]  SilverSol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[00:07:12.445 --> 00:07:15.847]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:24.015]  Silversol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:31.162]  Silversol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[00:07:31.162 --> 00:07:36.307]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacterias, molds, and yeasts.
[00:07:36.787 --> 00:07:43.309]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.
[00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:49.251]  Silver Sol Liquid and Gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.

[00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:12.194]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:17.842]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.062]  Oh yeah, we see the earth from here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:32.062 --> 00:08:41.569]  Thank you so much for joining us today as we blast out on the AM and FM dial, simulcast on XM 166.
[00:08:41.569 --> 00:08:47.053]  And we have Max Keiser joining us, coming up in the second hour.
[00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:51.377]  Always a popular and informative guest, so we have him on a couple times a month.
[00:08:51.377 --> 00:08:53.938]  MaxKeiser.com, of course, is his website.
[00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:56.761]  He's going to be giving us his take on what's happening with the economy.
[00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:04.823]  And I've got a whole parcel of nightly news reports that are just so important to air here on the radio.
[00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:08.623]  Really important information with Gary Johnson, Libertarian candidate.
[00:09:08.623 --> 00:09:10.524]  We've got a report from the NSA.
[00:09:10.524 --> 00:09:11.384]  We haven't aired all of it.
[00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:20.726]  We also have a very, very important report as well that is going to be getting into the Federal Reserve.
[00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:24.767]  And does the general public understand that it's a private run-for-profit
[00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:30.464]  Uh, bank ruling and hijacking this country.
[00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:55.152]  Now, uh, that said, ladies and gentlemen, we need to get into the fact that it is incredibly predictable that right as the president is set to sign an executive order, turning the internet over to a handful of mega corporations, that right as that is happening,
[00:09:56.223 --> 00:10:10.681]  That right as that is unfolding, that right as all of this is going on, magically the White House, Pentagon, and other systems supposedly get hacked from China.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.801]  And I'm not saying that Russia and China don't go around hacking into things.
[00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:17.001]  So do Western governments.
[00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:26.984]  I mean, all these countries mandate that their manufacturers put back doors into all the tech because governments and corporations all access into it.
[00:10:26.984 --> 00:10:35.007]  Then they use the back doors and all the tech as a pretext to take people's liberties and freedoms and bring in more control.
[00:10:35.007 --> 00:10:39.908]  But almost no one but CNET News and a few others is even getting half the story.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:57.495]  This is about not just the executive orders that Obama uses now to go to war, to hand over authority to the UN, to continue torture, secret arrest, the list goes on and on, but it's also about
[00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:18.443]  The fact that if you read what Obama's saying in the leaked text of the executive order that came out a few weeks ago, they say, oh well, Yahoo and Microsoft and Google and all these big companies, Sun Microsystems, Cisco, they are all for
[00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:25.555]  They are all for what's happening, so it's okay.
[00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:26.636]  They're stakeholders.
[00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:46.841]  It's that UN model of where they have groups that are lobbying and funding them that stand to gain, and then they supposedly speak for the public, and it's like, oh, well, these big megacorporations, most of which were founded and funded or are currently controlled by Western intelligence agencies, they say this is a good idea, something they want to do.
[00:11:47.895 --> 00:12:09.197]  Kind of like DARPA and the Pentagon helped create the internet, our purchases, our buying bandwidth, software engineers, programmers, we contributed to building what is the web, but the seed of it came out of the globalist mind back in the 60s on record to create a technotronic
[00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:09.817]  I think?
[00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:59.245]  One week before the naked body scanners, hundreds of them that had been purchased a year before, the order had gone in to build them a year before, their delivery was to be coming up in that January.
[00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:05.647]  So two years ago on Christmas Day, there is a underwear bomber
[00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:08.287]  Who the U.S.
[00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.729]  government, that's the banker government, gets on the airplane.
[00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:26.719]  So they put him on the airplane drooling drug, and then he has a firecracker go off in his pants, and then they go on the news that night and said, don't worry, we'll put these machines in next week.
[00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:28.960]  And said, we just got the idea.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.581]  We're gonna do this because of him.
[00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:36.045]  They ordered him a year before, turned off the head of Homeland Security, made money off of it, that's totally illegal, they don't care.
[00:13:38.223 --> 00:13:42.024]  Because it's a wall of criminality, a complete and total takeover.
[00:13:42.024 --> 00:13:44.846]  Well, it's the same story here.
[00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:54.249]  Today launches, today launches Cyber Security Awareness Month.
[00:13:54.249 --> 00:14:03.533]  That's federal globalist takeover of the web, turning everyone in IT into little globalist, federally, globally certified minions who get off on their new 007 role of being little spies.
[00:14:04.972 --> 00:14:16.289]  It's Internet taxes, Internet IDs, Internet regulations, control, Tier 1, Tier 2, Internet 2, shutting down the old free web by taking over roads and turning them into toll roads.
[00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:16.970]  That's what they're doing!
[00:14:18.413 --> 00:14:29.001]  National Cyber Security Awareness Month kicks off today with official launch event, Business Summit, and releases of online safety survey.
[00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:31.943]  October 1st, and what do you know?
[00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:45.893]  Two days before this, on the Saturday, on the 29th of September, 2012, the White House gets attacked on the eve of Obama saying, I'll protect us from them shy cums.
[00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:49.995]  Even if I gotta do an executive order.
[00:14:49.995 --> 00:15:02.423]  Besides, Google and Microsoft and all the other big companies, they stand behind me and we're voluntarily gonna track everything you do and make you use Internet ID.
[00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:04.785]  YouTube owned by Google's getting ready for that.
[00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:06.346]  They're all getting ready for it.
[00:15:06.346 --> 00:15:07.567]  Banning you off the web.
[00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:14.109]  Buy nor sell, just like a no-fly list, a no-internet list, a no-commerce list, if you're not a good little globalist.
[00:15:14.109 --> 00:15:15.809]  Face scanning to buy and sell.
[00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:22.071]  Does anyone understand the off-the-charts ramifications of what we're talking about here?
[00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:28.092]  Does anyone even begin to understand how serious this is?
[00:15:28.092 --> 00:15:35.434]  And how patently, ridiculously, filthily obvious and in-your-face it is, and staged.
[00:15:37.162 --> 00:15:40.746]  Just like the stupid underwear bomber.
[00:15:40.746 --> 00:15:51.279]  You know, when you're conscious and awake and informed, it's like watching... Watching the news, watching the general public is like watching sloths in slow motion.
[00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.023]  Literally, talking to people is like talking to sloths.
[00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:56.223]  And I don't understand it.
[00:15:56.223 --> 00:16:00.147]  I don't understand people who are not awake and who are not alive.
[00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:01.748]  And it's all over the place.
[00:16:01.748 --> 00:16:06.232]  People that even have intellects and have minds, they don't want to.
[00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:07.774]  And it's from television viewing.
[00:16:07.774 --> 00:16:10.576]  I can tell when somebody is a TV head.
[00:16:10.576 --> 00:16:12.478]  I don't care if they got 150 IQ.
[00:16:12.478 --> 00:16:15.481]  I can tell how much television someone watches.
[00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:21.626]  Because they have this look in their eyes, they value the lethargy of the mind.
[00:16:21.626 --> 00:16:23.748]  They value being conned.
[00:16:23.748 --> 00:16:26.350]  They value not understanding complex systems.
[00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.934]  They value not being into the mysteries of the universe.
[00:16:30.934 --> 00:16:33.016]  They value it.
[00:16:33.016 --> 00:16:37.741]  It just drives me up the stinking frickin' wall, man.
[00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:39.382]  I am so tired of it.
[00:16:40.143 --> 00:16:41.364]  They go on the news.
[00:16:41.364 --> 00:16:43.967]  I mean, that's how I knew it was staged that day before it even came out.
[00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:48.551]  And they said, don't worry, we just decided to put naked body scanners in next week.
[00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:56.959]  And I've been talking about it for a year because they put the multi-billion dollar purchase orders in.
[00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:02.624]  We've been talking about the conflict of him working for the company, being a consultant, even as he was the head of Homeland Security.
[00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:14.334]  He had begun some of the test programs, and now he was out of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff making all this money himself, millions and millions off of it.
[00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.817]  And it's just sick!
[00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:17.877]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:22.682]  This is pointed at people that are in a trance.
[00:17:22.682 --> 00:17:27.147]  I mean, anyone with a brain sees the PR rollout for the takeover of the web.
[00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:27.627]  Right there.
[00:17:27.627 --> 00:17:29.889]  The proof of the conspiracy is that.
[00:17:29.889 --> 00:17:31.831]  Not to mention all the documentation.
[00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:38.078]  All the reporters coming out from the New York Times and CNN about how they were all run by the Pentagon and foreign governments and the CIA.
[00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:51.968]  The CIA and the government and the FBI are now clients for foreign interest and they're like managers, middle managers that get a cut of how much they can sell us out.
[00:17:51.968 --> 00:17:56.832]  China, ladies and gentlemen, didn't try to hack the Pentagon.
[00:17:56.832 --> 00:18:01.195]  And it didn't try to hack the White House, ladies and gentlemen, unless they were ordered to.
[00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:03.456]  China and the bankers that run the U.S.
[00:18:03.456 --> 00:18:04.197]  are joint at the hip.
[00:18:06.812 --> 00:18:08.694]  China got the Panama Canal.
[00:18:08.694 --> 00:18:14.400]  China got all the big Caribbean islands that were formerly controlled by the United States.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.482]  China's getting our Pacific bases.
[00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:22.569]  China got 22 million dollars of our money to get, to help build the new GM factories.
[00:18:23.777 --> 00:18:25.298]  China gets all the technology.
[00:18:25.298 --> 00:18:26.860]  China gets the missile secrets.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.001]  China gets the jobs.
[00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:29.282]  China gets everything!
[00:18:29.282 --> 00:18:38.189]  Because China has signed on to the Agenda 21 program, and they're going to leverage India and the rest of the world, forcing them onto it.
[00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:45.456]  China is the big underwriter of the New World Order, because they will use their people up like
[00:18:46.553 --> 00:18:48.074]  Machines.
[00:18:48.074 --> 00:18:49.915]  They will set up suicide nets.
[00:18:49.915 --> 00:18:53.737]  They will set up forced abortion inside Foxconn for Apple.
[00:18:53.737 --> 00:18:57.779]  They will set up taking children at birth and putting them in government dormitories.
[00:18:57.779 --> 00:19:00.561]  They will run over protesters with steamrollers.
[00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:03.222]  They will sign on to anything.
[00:19:03.222 --> 00:19:08.265]  They're communist, murdering, disgusting, billionaire leadership.
[00:19:09.025 --> 00:19:10.146]  That's the model!
[00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:12.067]  You look at China, that's it!
[00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:16.910]  Oh, but now China... China hit the White House through Obama's!
[00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.492]  He's gotta do something!
[00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.833]  Only a moron would believe any of this!
[00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:24.295]  A two-year-old could tell what was going on here!
[00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:27.377]  This entire thing was rolled out!
[00:19:27.377 --> 00:19:38.383]  We even had articles, Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, countless other people on InfoWars.com, Principled.com, other sites, came out and broke down the entire story for you!
[00:19:38.383 --> 00:19:40.804]  The entire stinking thing!
[00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:42.825]  The entire thing!
[00:19:42.825 --> 00:19:44.086]  The entire thing!
[00:19:44.086 --> 00:19:46.027]  How they'd have a fake cyber attack!
[00:19:46.027 --> 00:19:52.211]  How they'd have a false flag to bring this in, right before he signs the stinking executive order, that they've got all lined up and ready!
[00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:55.043]  Get out of your trance!
[00:19:55.043 --> 00:19:57.268]  Stop valuing your stupidity!
[00:19:57.268 --> 00:19:59.514]  Stop valuing your weakness!
[00:19:59.514 --> 00:20:00.075]  WAKE UP!
[00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.190]  Hi there.
[00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.731]  My name is Frank Bates.
[00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:07.553]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[00:20:07.553 --> 00:20:16.699]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:23.404]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[00:20:23.404 --> 00:20:25.605]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:30.689]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[00:20:31.409 --> 00:20:39.355]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[00:20:39.355 --> 00:20:44.939]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:51.443]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[00:20:51.443 --> 00:20:57.147]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:20:57.147 --> 00:20:58.268]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:02.690]  You store guns, ammo, and food and water.
[00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.011]  But do you store peace of mind when it comes to your firearms?
[00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:07.872]  Now you can with DuraCoat.
[00:21:07.872 --> 00:21:11.893]  The last thing anyone needs is a firearm that won't work when you need it most.

[00:22:59.442 --> 00:23:04.203]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:23:04.203 --> 00:23:06.324]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:23:07.237 --> 00:23:16.212]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain its world-class healer.
[00:23:16.212 --> 00:23:21.140]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[00:23:21.758 --> 00:23:33.125]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:40.129]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:45.114]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[00:23:45.114 --> 00:23:48.717]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[00:23:48.717 --> 00:23:55.984]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[00:23:55.984 --> 00:23:57.246]  Protect your immune system.
[00:23:57.246 --> 00:23:58.287]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:12.940]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:20.752]  You know why I'm yelling and screaming?
[00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:26.434]  It's that I know where this road goes.
[00:24:26.434 --> 00:24:29.475]  I know who the globalists are.
[00:24:39.918 --> 00:24:45.561]  I know what their global plan is, and I know they're going to execute it if we don't stop them.
[00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:50.263]  And we are living in a science fiction horror movie.
[00:24:50.263 --> 00:24:55.205]  The globalists, in their own words, depending on which document, are six to ten years behind.
[00:24:55.205 --> 00:24:58.126]  Brzezinski has said it.
[00:24:58.126 --> 00:25:01.548]  Countless others have broken down the fact that they are behind.
[00:25:02.657 --> 00:25:13.785]  But I intend to make a new special report in the next few weeks that basically breaks down their New World Order plan in a simplistic fashion.
[00:25:13.785 --> 00:25:16.907]  People think it's complex, but it'll actually be simplistic.
[00:25:16.907 --> 00:25:23.892]  And then show the timeline of where they plan to go, where they want to be, versus where they are right now.
[00:25:23.892 --> 00:25:30.337]  And if there was just a revolution of understanding in people's minds, we could turn this around right now.
[00:25:32.006 --> 00:25:42.854]  If we collectively come together with an understanding that being spied on without warrants is to enslave us, not to keep us safe.
[00:25:42.854 --> 00:25:54.322]  That the government is not a government but a foreign occupation force shipping drugs in as a pretext to break into our houses and run checkpoints and to fund their criminal takeover.
[00:25:55.489 --> 00:26:05.077]  When we wake up to the fact that the CPS, taking children, is the last group you'd ever want children around in your life.
[00:26:05.077 --> 00:26:14.626]  That the medical system has good people in it at the bottom, but at the top is a Rockefeller-controlled, MD, modern science of eugenics.
[00:26:14.626 --> 00:26:16.587]  We live in the kingdom of eugenics.
[00:26:16.587 --> 00:26:20.391]  We live in the kingdom of covert and overt testing.
[00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.292]  And it's in the news, but it's just a minor footnote.
[00:26:24.292 --> 00:26:31.158]  Hey, the government admits they shot up, you know, 67,000 kids in India last year with live, weaponized polio.
[00:26:31.158 --> 00:26:32.780]  Yeah, a bunch of them died.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.221]  Others are paralyzed.
[00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:38.425]  Next in news, we need to take all your rights away, because Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:41.948]  And in the other news, the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:45.011]  I mean, it's just so insane.
[00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:47.433]  And they only get away with this
[00:26:50.265 --> 00:27:02.174]  They only get away with this because the general public has been taught it's cute and funny to laugh at anybody who's informed or involved or who cares.
[00:27:02.174 --> 00:27:03.034]  But that's changing.
[00:27:03.034 --> 00:27:05.997]  More and more people realize it's about survival to care.
[00:27:05.997 --> 00:27:07.858]  And it's not bad to be involved.
[00:27:07.858 --> 00:27:10.440]  And it's not weird to be informed.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.323]  This morning I was exercising at a local natural pool here in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:17.225]  Swum a couple miles.
[00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:18.746]  Got up about 5 a.m., went down there.
[00:27:22.418 --> 00:27:28.302]  There was a fella there about, he said, hey, you know, this New York Times writer, this whistleblower, just came into town.
[00:27:28.302 --> 00:27:38.968]  We were talking about how I had Amber Lyon on the CNN reporter that blew the whistle about how their government and foreign government run and it's fraud and they cover up massacres and it's just pure evil.
[00:27:38.968 --> 00:27:45.492]  And he was like, hey, you know, this New York Times reporter, you know, he'd want to come on your show.
[00:27:45.492 --> 00:27:48.314]  And I was going, oh, yeah, I've been working on getting him on.
[00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:49.454]  And the guy's like, well, I'm friends with him.
[00:27:49.454 --> 00:27:50.055]  Here's his number.
[00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:56.818]  And there were these old men who were swimmers who'd gotten there and they were laughing at us.
[00:27:56.818 --> 00:27:58.279]  And looking at me and laughing.
[00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:59.941]  They obviously knew who I was.
[00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:02.444]  And they were like trying to be dominant, tough old men.
[00:28:02.444 --> 00:28:07.290]  And they were, you know, into themselves because they were in great shape and all this.
[00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.231]  And I looked at them.
[00:28:09.403 --> 00:28:14.228]  And I just realized I'm threatening their whole world that America's the good guys.
[00:28:14.228 --> 00:28:15.969]  They're part of the system.
[00:28:15.969 --> 00:28:20.174]  You know, yeah, the CIA does bad stuff, but you know, they know best.
[00:28:20.174 --> 00:28:21.215]  They know what they're doing.
[00:28:21.215 --> 00:28:24.918]  You can tell these guys were like retired government types.
[00:28:24.918 --> 00:28:29.402]  And I just thought about how incredibly weak they were mentally.
[00:28:30.424 --> 00:28:31.044]  But it didn't matter.
[00:28:31.044 --> 00:28:36.768]  Then about 10 more people, because there weren't many people there, were like coming over going, oh yeah, blah blah blah, this, that.
[00:28:36.768 --> 00:28:40.270]  And then they saw that as they were getting ready to get in the water and it totally freaked them out.
[00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.293]  Because at first they were laughing at us and kind of pointing at us right in front of us.
[00:28:46.587 --> 00:28:54.333]  Right in front of us, they were wanting to ridicule us like we care what they say or what they think.
[00:28:54.333 --> 00:29:10.364]  Like we're gonna go curl up in a fetal position and urinate all over ourselves because you people that suck off the government trough and the system and who get reflected glory from its evil, worshipping its black altar of death, you think laughing at us has any effect?
[00:29:10.424 --> 00:29:24.714]  It has no effect on us, it has no effect on me, but to make me recharge and turbo against all of you, you will be defeated, you murdering scum, and all the servants of it, you will all be defeated!
[00:29:24.714 --> 00:29:26.976]  Probably shouldn't even be on the radio today, I'm so angry right now.
[00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:27.896]  I thought I could take on 20 people!
[00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:30.668]  I'm sick of it!
[00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:33.750]  And I see the New World Order, I see you, and I know what you are!
[00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.151]  And I know who all your weak servants are, too!
[00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:45.798]  And I swear on the altar of God, eternal resistance over every form of tyranny, over the mind of man... I will never submit!
[00:29:45.798 --> 00:29:49.861]  And my soul is free!
[00:29:49.861 --> 00:29:51.262]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.262 --> 00:29:53.784]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.784 --> 00:29:56.486]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:05.994]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:30:05.994 --> 00:30:08.396]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:30:08.396 --> 00:30:17.503]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:20.946]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[00:30:24.908 --> 00:30:27.410]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:30:28.471 --> 00:30:29.991]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:30:29.991 --> 00:30:31.432]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:30:31.432 --> 00:30:34.593]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:30:34.593 --> 00:30:37.953]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:30:37.953 --> 00:30:42.095]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:44.835]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:30:44.835 --> 00:30:46.416]  It's what my family uses.
[00:30:46.416 --> 00:30:49.737]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:31:59.952 --> 00:32:00.953]  Aaron Fullin here.
[00:32:00.953 --> 00:32:12.539]  As the Food Police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:16.602]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[00:32:16.602 --> 00:32:19.363]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the Food Police are so afraid of.
[00:32:19.363 --> 00:32:26.988]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[00:32:27.248 --> 00:32:35.055]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[00:32:35.055 --> 00:32:36.176]  But here's some good news.
[00:32:36.176 --> 00:32:42.021]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:45.703]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[00:32:45.703 --> 00:32:48.564]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:50.586]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[00:32:50.586 --> 00:32:53.007]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods.
[00:32:53.007 --> 00:32:56.709]  And you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[00:32:56.709 --> 00:33:05.214]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[00:33:05.214 --> 00:33:11.197]  A decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
[00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:19.433]  When they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing, there will be only one course of action open.
[00:33:19.433 --> 00:33:20.874]  Total commitment.
[00:33:20.874 --> 00:33:24.415]  Mandrake, do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war?
[00:33:24.415 --> 00:33:28.657]  No, I didn't think I knew what he was talking about.
[00:33:28.657 --> 00:33:32.199]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[00:33:32.199 --> 00:33:37.162]  When he said that, fifty years ago, he might have been right.
[00:33:37.162 --> 00:33:41.164]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:50.108]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[00:33:50.108 --> 00:33:54.189]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:54.189 --> 00:33:57.190]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:03.933]  Oh yeah, I'm wound up today.
[00:34:03.933 --> 00:34:05.754]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:12.643]  And I have read giant stacks of news information and I am fit to be tied.
[00:34:12.643 --> 00:34:14.565]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:14.565 --> 00:34:19.569]  Max Keiser is coming up.
[00:34:19.569 --> 00:34:26.674]  All right, let me just try to calmly go through the news information here today as we transmit worldwide.
[00:34:26.674 --> 00:34:27.655]  Where to begin?
[00:34:27.655 --> 00:34:30.637]  Let me just start back where I was at here.
[00:34:30.637 --> 00:34:35.621]  White House confirms cyber attack.
[00:34:35.621 --> 00:34:37.163]  White House confirmed.
[00:34:39.073 --> 00:34:40.594]  But sought to downplay.
[00:34:40.594 --> 00:34:41.335]  They always do that.
[00:34:41.335 --> 00:34:45.798]  Have the media hype Total Fear and then they act like the quiet father figures.
[00:34:45.798 --> 00:34:47.479]  It's a playbook.
[00:34:47.479 --> 00:34:56.946]  To downplay a report by a conservative website on Sunday that it had been the victim of a cyber attack volunteering to Politico that no harm had been done.
[00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:04.634]  The Washington Free Beacon reported that Chinese hackers had attacked a computer system in the White House military office.
[00:35:04.634 --> 00:35:06.075]  Yeah, that came from the Secret Service.
[00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:07.736]  I know where they get that stuff.
[00:35:07.736 --> 00:35:20.865]  A White House official speaking on background late Sunday confirmed there was an attempted hack which said that it affected an unclassified network that was isolated and that there was no evidence that any data had been stolen.
[00:35:22.366 --> 00:35:36.118]  The attempted hack was used spear phishing in which an attacker sends an email to a specific target that uses familiar phrases in hopes that the recipient will follow links or download attachments that unleash the hacker's malware.
[00:35:36.118 --> 00:35:40.322]  Oh no, not a malware packet!
[00:35:40.322 --> 00:35:42.624]  What are we going to do?
[00:35:42.624 --> 00:35:45.386]  Take all our rights away?
[00:35:45.386 --> 00:35:46.947]  Take my internet freedom away?
[00:35:46.947 --> 00:35:48.289]  Tax the internet some more?
[00:35:49.577 --> 00:36:06.340]  Put new taxes on the web to help fund the takeover of the... What about the emails of all the gal pals of Big Sis and the Hanky Panky up there in the Party Palace, the little Pleasure Palace?
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.581]  Those pesky emails on Fast and Furious.
[00:36:09.581 --> 00:36:13.102]  None of the White House Secure Classified Computer Systems were affected.
[00:36:13.102 --> 00:36:13.822]  Oh, thank goodness.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.081]  Said the official.
[00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:16.982]  Not a servant.
[00:36:16.982 --> 00:36:18.303]  It was an official.
[00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:19.023]  Not a public servant.
[00:36:19.023 --> 00:36:19.804]  It was an official.
[00:36:19.804 --> 00:36:21.245]  You scum.
[00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:22.186]  Americans.
[00:36:22.186 --> 00:36:37.879]  Who reached out to Politico after the Free Beacon story appeared without having been asked for a comment.
[00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:39.340]  And it just goes on.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.082]  And again, when was this launched?
[00:36:41.082 --> 00:36:41.983]  When was this launched?
[00:36:43.656 --> 00:36:49.421]  Oh, the Sacramento Bee reports Cybersecurity Awareness Month for the first time kicked off today.
[00:36:49.421 --> 00:36:57.708]  Oh, and there was the big hack right as Obama is set this week to sign the unconstitutional executive order.
[00:36:57.708 --> 00:37:00.030]  And here's the big news.
[00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:04.875]  To hand the once free internet over even more to Google.
[00:37:06.136 --> 00:37:15.004]  Microsoft and Yahoo and Sun Microsystems and Cisco and all the usual suspects.
[00:37:15.004 --> 00:37:17.347]  Oracle.
[00:37:17.347 --> 00:37:19.448]  All of them.
[00:37:19.448 --> 00:37:29.438]  Cybersecurity with the Pentagon over the web tracking everyone publicly with all their new giant NSA centers that are opening up in San Antonio that opened a year ago.
[00:37:29.438 --> 00:37:31.139]  Giant facility no one talks about.
[00:37:32.276 --> 00:37:37.740]  Local news goes down there and they grab their cameras from the two local papers.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.942]  Do the papers sue them?
[00:37:39.942 --> 00:37:40.202]  No.
[00:37:40.202 --> 00:37:51.130]  Our people went down there and handed them the successful lawsuit articles last week, Jakari Jackson and Melissa Melton, and explained to them they were there to go visit the visitor center, which there isn't one.
[00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.332]  They wanted to buy NSA shot glass, they told them.
[00:37:54.332 --> 00:37:55.473]  Being sarcastic.
[00:37:55.473 --> 00:38:00.057]  And just let them know that I was intending to basically sue the NSA if they took our stuff.
[00:38:00.919 --> 00:38:07.943]  Because they don't have a right to not have you go down there and videotape that they're down there, a giant facility.
[00:38:07.943 --> 00:38:14.087]  Just like the TSA, and I'll get to that in a minute, had to admit because of lawsuits that you can film them.
[00:38:14.087 --> 00:38:17.049]  They still try to intimidate you or set you up because they're criminals.
[00:38:18.476 --> 00:38:20.497]  As their own members are getting convicted.
[00:38:20.497 --> 00:38:22.678]  One guy stole almost a million dollars.
[00:38:22.678 --> 00:38:23.758]  He said, oh, we all do it.
[00:38:23.758 --> 00:38:25.179]  We're addicted.
[00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:27.279]  That's why we get the jobs to rob you.
[00:38:27.279 --> 00:38:30.041]  Of course, of course.
[00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:35.683]  Why do you think the brown shirts joined Adolf Hitler?
[00:38:35.683 --> 00:38:37.664]  Because they got to have some fun.
[00:38:37.664 --> 00:38:41.485]  And the Soviets hired the criminals out of the jails.
[00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:43.926]  That's why they run a background check for TSA now.
[00:38:43.926 --> 00:38:45.186]  Wasn't like this 10 years ago.
[00:38:45.186 --> 00:38:46.227]  They're phasing it in now.
[00:38:47.247 --> 00:38:50.488]  Where they hire, they go, oh, you got felonies here.
[00:38:50.488 --> 00:38:52.409]  You're a convicted child molester.
[00:38:52.409 --> 00:38:53.549]  That's their favorite.
[00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:54.770]  Oh, you're a convicted rapist.
[00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.611]  Oh, you're a convicted car thief.
[00:38:56.611 --> 00:39:00.472]  Hey, pal, you're in charge.
[00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:02.333]  I have a stack of articles on that today.
[00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:06.374]  You're in charge now.
[00:39:06.374 --> 00:39:09.835]  Now get in there and grab some little kids.
[00:39:09.835 --> 00:39:11.156]  Grab some women.
[00:39:11.156 --> 00:39:15.097]  You see Miss USA?
[00:39:15.097 --> 00:39:16.118]  Go in those pants.
[00:39:17.935 --> 00:39:19.075]  Freedom!
[00:39:19.075 --> 00:39:21.696]  And when people don't like it like me, they go, oh, that's a crazy man.
[00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:23.877]  And you bet I am crazy.
[00:39:23.877 --> 00:39:25.137]  I'm crazy because I love liberty.
[00:39:25.137 --> 00:39:26.657]  I'm crazy because I got a backbone.
[00:39:26.657 --> 00:39:32.739]  I'm crazy because I am in a fit of rage, knowing that pure evil is taking over.
[00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:44.822]  And I'm here to get people out of their trance.
[00:39:44.822 --> 00:39:46.443]  I am beside myself.
[00:39:49.928 --> 00:39:52.962]  I have fought for 17 plus years against a globalist.
[00:39:54.534 --> 00:39:57.556]  And I am so concerned because it's all coming true.
[00:39:57.556 --> 00:39:59.978]  It's all happening just as we said it would.
[00:39:59.978 --> 00:40:05.021]  We successfully re-engineered, reverse-engineered all of it over a decade ago.
[00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:07.323]  And now it's worse than we even thought.
[00:40:07.323 --> 00:40:09.864]  You think I'm pleased to be right about this?
[00:40:09.864 --> 00:40:11.085]  You think this is a good thing?
[00:40:11.085 --> 00:40:12.166]  This is not a good thing.
[00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:13.247]  This is a bad thing.
[00:40:13.247 --> 00:40:14.908]  This is a horrible thing.
[00:40:14.908 --> 00:40:16.208]  This is a painful thing.
[00:40:16.208 --> 00:40:19.090]  This is an overwhelmingly horrible, disgusting thing.
[00:40:20.703 --> 00:40:27.230]  It's like thinking, oh, this lump, you know, it'd be like if your wife had a big lump on her breast and she goes, I hope it's not breast cancer, baby.
[00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.854]  And she goes in and it's a horrible stage four malignancy.
[00:40:30.854 --> 00:40:33.957]  You know, you're not like, oh, I was right!
[00:40:33.957 --> 00:40:35.459]  It was breast cancer!
[00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:57.666]  And then I see how weak the general public is, how weak many of the quote, resistors are, the people in the alternative media, how they're in it for themselves or don't even have full understanding of the deeper issues or even partial understanding.
[00:40:57.666 --> 00:40:58.747]  And then I realize.
[00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:07.886]  That as a society we're rotting and it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
[00:41:07.886 --> 00:41:15.678]  But then I realized the good news, there are so many good, decent, average people who are humble and so they do not...
[00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:23.952]  They do not see themselves in the capacity, they do not see themselves in the role as of resistors.
[00:41:23.952 --> 00:41:28.094]  Because they almost see it as polite that they're letting evil run over them.
[00:41:28.094 --> 00:41:35.216]  They sit there like a Buddhist monk or something while Rome burns around them and we cannot be in that mode.
[00:41:35.216 --> 00:41:40.058]  We've got to get out there and face this down and get angry about it.
[00:41:40.058 --> 00:41:41.479]  Am I too angry sometimes?
[00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:41.779]  Maybe!
[00:41:42.981 --> 00:42:02.670]  But there's the added frustration of not just the New World Order, but having to deal with everything that goes on in the oiling and maintenance of this platform, trying to direct my energies and analysis at the enemy.
[00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.451]  Because let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, it's all gonna come true.
[00:42:07.048 --> 00:42:08.789]  We're under soft kill right now.
[00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:15.974]  They're just testing agents on us, figuring out how to gauge it, seeing if we'll wake up to the fact that they're just openly killing us.
[00:42:15.974 --> 00:42:22.578]  I mean, just cancer exploding all around us, disease, every degenerative disorder exploding off the charts.
[00:42:22.578 --> 00:42:23.959]  I mean, they're killing us.
[00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:25.300]  They're killing us with the GMO.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.380]  It's even on record.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.203]  Sterilizes, kills, deforms, and all the animals they feed it to.
[00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:38.433]  And the huge magnitude of it is why they're getting away with it.
[00:42:38.433 --> 00:42:44.956]  Because it's so off the charts that a regular person cannot sanely deal with this, so they go into denial.
[00:42:46.528 --> 00:42:51.351]  I am a sane person, but it has driven me insane knowing the information.
[00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:58.736]  And by insane, to an outward person hearing the heavy breathing, the sighing, the tooth grinding, all of it, it's like, well, that guy's nuts.
[00:42:58.736 --> 00:43:08.282]  Well, no, if you know psycho killers are poisoning everyone around you, the public's giggling at you, sucking their thumbs in trances, falling off the edge of cliffs all around you.
[00:43:08.282 --> 00:43:10.743]  People are moving in slow motion in a matrix.
[00:43:10.743 --> 00:43:12.965]  You know the general public is literally in a trance.
[00:43:18.024 --> 00:43:29.915]  In the aggregate, hundreds of millions believe you and listen to you and have found out you're telling the truth, but then they still look to you to be able to have all the answers.
[00:43:29.915 --> 00:43:31.916]  It just makes me physically ill.
[00:43:31.916 --> 00:43:38.943]  It makes me physically ill to know that it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:43:40.828 --> 00:43:57.064]  And that we have a giant arrested development childlike population watching giant fat rappers with pants hanging down around their ankles with huge bellies in fur coats and this is force-fed on television to the young people teaching them how to shoot each other.
[00:43:58.132 --> 00:44:04.976]  And to know that inside MTV that they weaponized it 20 years ago on purpose to destroy the youth.
[00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:11.741]  I mean, we already knew that, but to know from insiders that it was consciously done just confirms it all.
[00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:14.483]  It's just, it's, we're being hit by torpedoes.
[00:44:14.483 --> 00:44:21.207]  Chemical, biological, cultural, cultural viruses, cultural death switches, cultural destruction.
[00:44:23.226 --> 00:44:31.574]  And then I even feel guilty getting up here on air and playing all these pathetic welfare people talking about their Obama phones and stuff because we're all laughing at it.
[00:44:31.574 --> 00:44:35.538]  He's laughing at it because it's so sad, but it's even sick to laugh at it.
[00:44:35.538 --> 00:44:36.339]  None of it's funny.
[00:44:36.339 --> 00:44:39.542]  It's disgusting.
[00:44:39.542 --> 00:44:46.549]  And those of us laughing at things like that because deep down it makes us feel superior or maybe it's just so embarrassing we're laughing because we're uncomfortable.
[00:44:47.856 --> 00:44:57.681]  We've been stunted, we've been damaged as well from the heights that our minds would have, would have, would have soared to.
[00:44:57.681 --> 00:45:03.644]  Soared to, like Icarus.
[00:45:03.644 --> 00:45:13.229]  But you sail to the sun, you fly to the sun, it melts your wax wings and you fall to earth.
[00:45:13.229 --> 00:45:14.790]  But the globalists, they didn't fly.
[00:45:15.708 --> 00:45:16.769]  And then fall to earth.
[00:45:16.769 --> 00:45:22.792]  No, they burrowed until they broke through to the deepest dimensions of hell.
[00:45:22.792 --> 00:45:29.776]  And now they write in our societal essence, our societal guts, our societal blood on the walls of society.
[00:45:29.776 --> 00:45:35.720]  Their horrible, their horrible demonic artwork all around us.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.301]  Ugh!
[00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:39.702]  The ugliness of it.
[00:45:39.702 --> 00:45:40.963]  The stanch of it.
[00:45:42.611 --> 00:45:47.814]  Careful you do not stare into the abyss for the abyss will change you.
[00:45:47.814 --> 00:45:50.716]  You will become the abyss.
[00:45:50.716 --> 00:45:52.597]  The abyss.
[00:45:52.597 --> 00:46:08.325]  The abyss of black death as deep as the gravity wells of the greatest black holes.
[00:46:08.325 --> 00:46:11.227]  Okay, let's go ahead and get to the next pieces of news here.
[00:46:11.872 --> 00:46:15.935]  Oh look, CNN's warning you of the new threat.
[00:46:15.935 --> 00:46:18.477]  Your smartphone will eventually be hacked.
[00:46:18.477 --> 00:46:20.259]  Oh, because you built back doors into it.
[00:46:20.259 --> 00:46:28.325]  Of course, I've been telling you this is all just total hacks, total things are going to be breaking down, takedowns, because they built back doors into it.
[00:46:28.325 --> 00:46:36.411]  Then they're going to get up on the news and say, because the Chinese government orders their manufacturers to put these back doors in the chips.
[00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:38.873]  Under global governance agreements and compacts,
[00:46:40.285 --> 00:46:46.171]  They have built back doors into everything because the devices you purchase are not there for you to use them.
[00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:47.573]  That's just one function.
[00:46:47.573 --> 00:46:57.604]  The main function is to track you and predict your future movements while damaging your DNA with a radiation burst in the microwave radiation field.
[00:47:00.034 --> 00:47:03.235]  Your smartphone will eventually be hacked, CNN.
[00:47:03.235 --> 00:47:08.737]  Security experts have warned for years that our smartphones are due for a major cyber attack.
[00:47:08.737 --> 00:47:09.757]  Oh, really?
[00:47:09.757 --> 00:47:12.878]  Like PCs back in the early days of the 1990s.
[00:47:12.878 --> 00:47:15.899]  Mobile phones are largely unprotected by antivirus software.
[00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:18.500]  Don't worry though, there's companies willing to sell that to you.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.521]  Of course, design the viruses.
[00:47:20.521 --> 00:47:24.062]  And they're a treasure trove of valuable information.
[00:47:24.062 --> 00:47:26.423]  So why hasn't the smartphone Armageddon happened yet?
[00:47:27.557 --> 00:47:29.418]  Basic economics is one reason.
[00:47:29.418 --> 00:47:35.781]  Cyber thieves are making so much money attacking Windows PCs that there hasn't been much incentive to change tactics.
[00:47:35.781 --> 00:47:37.242]  Oh, really?
[00:47:37.242 --> 00:47:40.623]  And it just goes on with more BS.
[00:47:40.623 --> 00:47:41.644]  Let me get into this here.
[00:47:41.644 --> 00:47:44.785]  This is really one of the top stories today, and I haven't covered this properly.
[00:47:44.785 --> 00:47:46.506]  I haven't given it justice.
[00:47:46.506 --> 00:47:48.787]  It's a big deal, and everybody needs to be part of it.
[00:47:50.134 --> 00:47:53.795]  TSA confiscates camera, deletes footage of checkpoint.
[00:47:53.795 --> 00:47:55.716]  TSA worker steals memory card.
[00:47:55.716 --> 00:48:02.839]  Cops claim it must have fallen to the ground after they erased the video.
[00:48:02.839 --> 00:48:08.601]  And here's the latest headline by Paul Joseph Watson up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:48:08.601 --> 00:48:17.004]  TSA rescinds approval to film in response to opt-out campaign.
[00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:24.236]  Federal agency removes web page admitting filming is not prohibited.
[00:48:24.236 --> 00:48:31.849]  We have it screenshotted saying the TSA does not prohibit the public, passengers, or press from photographing, videotaping, or filming at security checkpoints.
[00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:35.659]  As long as the screening process is not interfered with.
[00:48:35.659 --> 00:48:39.563]  See, cops can't arrest you for filming them unless you interfere with their activities.
[00:48:39.563 --> 00:48:43.466]  They now call that 300 yards away if you're filming them doing anything.
[00:48:43.466 --> 00:48:50.913]  Now, in 12 states they arrest you and charge you with wiretapping, which the statutes all state that in public you have no perception of privacy and it's not wiretapping.
[00:48:50.913 --> 00:48:51.514]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:48:51.514 --> 00:48:55.077]  They've got kept juries a lot of times that are paid cash.
[00:48:55.077 --> 00:48:57.580]  And, you know, they're to send you to prison because that's all part of the evil.
[00:48:58.257 --> 00:49:01.798]  You don't film in America, you American filth!
[00:49:01.798 --> 00:49:13.263]  Foreign banks have engaged in conquest, and we have found the worst elements of your population through psychological algorithm testing to serve our army.
[00:49:13.263 --> 00:49:16.324]  Our army is now forged.
[00:49:16.324 --> 00:49:20.726]  The false flags will be launched, American scum!
[00:49:20.726 --> 00:49:26.688]  We work tirelessly behind the scenes, weakening your culture, poisoning your minds.
[00:49:27.288 --> 00:49:33.453]  And now we prepare with our re-education camps to murder you en masse.
[00:49:33.453 --> 00:49:36.176]  That's how the globalists would sound if they spoke to you openly.
[00:49:36.176 --> 00:49:41.740]  It doesn't matter if the army admits there's public re-education camps.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.223]  Doesn't matter if that's been out for almost four months.
[00:49:44.223 --> 00:49:47.505]  No mainstream media dare touch it.
[00:49:47.505 --> 00:49:50.067]  That's a little too scary for the slaves.
[00:49:57.691 --> 00:49:59.132]  People say, Alex, don't scare us.
[00:49:59.132 --> 00:50:00.193]  I don't think you're scared.
[00:50:00.193 --> 00:50:06.937]  I think maybe the truth is the only shot we've got to get you out of the coma you're in, to realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:13.862]  You think it intimidates me, these cowardly scum trying to bring in this hell?
[00:50:13.862 --> 00:50:18.245]  My very DNA cries out against them.
[00:50:18.245 --> 00:50:18.986]  And I am here
[00:50:20.677 --> 00:50:28.702]  To reach out and to awaken the sleeping giant that is free humanity and we are waking up and the enemy is actually scared.
[00:50:28.702 --> 00:50:35.567]  That's why they have the bravado and the in your face and trying to rush their whole program because they're behind schedule.
[00:50:35.567 --> 00:50:36.428]  They're in trouble.
[00:50:37.288 --> 00:50:43.692]  And they know, they know we've beaten them over and over and over again.
[00:50:43.692 --> 00:50:49.216]  And the next time we beat them, it will be forever.
[00:50:49.216 --> 00:50:59.903]  There'll be shadows of evil again, but this great battle, if we survive it, will be the great reversal for our species and will give us the greatest shot ever to reach Alpha Centauris.
[00:51:00.743 --> 00:51:01.744]  Aaron Fullin here.
[00:51:01.744 --> 00:51:13.269]  As the Food Police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[00:51:13.269 --> 00:51:17.291]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:20.032]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the Food Police are so afraid of.
[00:51:20.032 --> 00:51:27.596]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[00:51:27.856 --> 00:51:35.606]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[00:51:35.606 --> 00:51:36.727]  But here's some good news!
[00:51:36.727 --> 00:51:39.951]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing
[00:51:41.477 --> 00:51:41.857]  I think so.
[00:52:00.342 --> 00:52:06.286]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.
[00:52:06.286 --> 00:52:11.809]  Our product line has grown from 5 to nearly 100 items in less than 5 years.

[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:38.806]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:52:38.806 --> 00:52:39.607]  This capitalism?
[00:52:39.607 --> 00:52:45.871]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:46.752]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:52:46.752 --> 00:52:49.974]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:52.776]  That's 800-686-2237.

[00:53:23.484 --> 00:53:26.867]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.

[00:54:18.863 --> 00:54:24.888]  Alright, let me tell you what's coming up when Max Keiser is on with us and then into the third hour when I have open phones today.
[00:54:24.888 --> 00:54:35.938]  I'm going to spend a good portion of time playing some of the news reports from the Nightly News because they're so powerful and I want the full radio listeners to be able to hear it.
[00:54:35.938 --> 00:54:39.361]  Also, PrisonPlanet.tv viewers right now ought to be able to see it.
[00:54:40.714 --> 00:54:45.256]  TSA rescinds approval to film in response to opt-out campaign.
[00:54:45.256 --> 00:54:51.079]  Maybe, maybe, maybe they'll rescind the law that they can't rape my wife.
[00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:57.822]  Maybe they'll rescind the law that they can't come take the jewelry out of my wife's bedroom.
[00:54:57.822 --> 00:55:03.104]  Maybe they'll rescind the law that I can't have my Second Amendment because we're living under executive orders.
[00:55:03.104 --> 00:55:10.047]  See, over lawsuits and things, they had to have on their website, started about four years ago, that of course you can film us as long as you don't interfere.
[00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:16.192]  But in their training videos, they tell them someone's video and they must be a terrorist.
[00:55:16.192 --> 00:55:17.573]  So harass them.
[00:55:17.573 --> 00:55:25.496]  So the cops in these videos that Watson's linked to, come up and act like you're doing something wrong and they'll tell you, it's the law, we're going to arrest you.
[00:55:25.496 --> 00:55:27.577]  And then they'll try to intimidate you to turn it off.
[00:55:27.577 --> 00:55:34.621]  But if you call their bluff, they back off because there's still a little bit of sanity left in the courts.
[00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:36.642]  They're filming you, but you're not supposed to film them.
[00:55:37.799 --> 00:55:42.008]  And I'm so sick of even our articles saying officers.
[00:55:42.008 --> 00:55:42.910]  They call them officers.
[00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:44.734]  They're not even sworn officers.
[00:55:44.734 --> 00:55:48.081]  But they have sworn officers come up and do their dirty work, and that is so shameful.
[00:55:49.548 --> 00:56:06.265]  And at the end of this article by Paul Joseph Watson, there's a special comment from Alex Jones, because we're launching this First Amendment week for the week of Thanksgiving to opt out of the naked body scanners that top scientists admit are giving people cancer, including the TSA workers at the airports where they've been testing them for nine years.
[00:56:06.265 --> 00:56:08.367]  They had them in six airports starting nine years ago.
[00:56:08.367 --> 00:56:12.231]  That was like a seven-fold increase in cancers just at Boston.
[00:56:13.598 --> 00:56:16.240]  I mean that's why they hire stupid little criminals.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.962]  Now the first TSA were mainly like post office type people.
[00:56:18.962 --> 00:56:20.824]  They weren't bad people.
[00:56:20.824 --> 00:56:22.265]  Now they're a bunch of scum.
[00:56:22.265 --> 00:56:24.166]  And by the way, that's in the news.
[00:56:24.166 --> 00:56:27.229]  Here's the Associated Press, the Daily Mail is also reporting on it.
[00:56:27.229 --> 00:56:30.291]  I was addicted to stealing and everyone else did it too.
[00:56:30.291 --> 00:56:37.777]  Ex-TSA agent reveals epidemic of thefts from passengers as he admits he took almost one million in possessions.
[00:56:37.777 --> 00:56:39.639]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been robbed
[00:56:40.714 --> 00:56:45.456]  Well, we've had stuff stolen out of our bags, electrical stuff.
[00:56:45.456 --> 00:56:52.738]  We've had a baby Tiffany teething ring stolen seven years ago, flying out of JFK back to Austin.
[00:56:52.738 --> 00:56:55.619]  Then I bought my newborn daughter.
[00:56:55.619 --> 00:56:57.480]  I had Dr. Pachinik on.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.240]  He had a sleeping pill stolen.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.662]  That's what they really is, is addictive drugs, folks.
[00:57:03.662 --> 00:57:06.783]  You fly with your medication, sleeping pills or whatever, it's gone.
[00:57:07.683 --> 00:57:08.723]  I mean, these are drug addicts.
[00:57:08.723 --> 00:57:11.684]  Some of them are drug addicts, others are pervs.
[00:57:11.684 --> 00:57:12.985]  They all got a poison.
[00:57:12.985 --> 00:57:15.926]  They all got a vice in the devil's little playhouse.
[00:57:15.926 --> 00:57:19.627]  But let me tell you, they say idle hands are the devil's workshop.
[00:57:19.627 --> 00:57:24.368]  Let me tell you, TSA and airports are the devil's workshop.
[00:57:24.368 --> 00:57:26.529]  That's where the real slammin' and bammin' goes on.
[00:57:27.847 --> 00:57:30.149]  There's a special comment down there at the bottom.
[00:57:30.149 --> 00:57:34.873]  There is an organized move on behalf of Governments Corporation to bully the First Amendment out of existence.
[00:57:34.873 --> 00:57:41.359]  This is why Infowars is pioneering a new civil rights movement that is not based around race, sex, or any other minority issue.
[00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:51.549]  The fact that our rights are being violated characterizes suspicious and terroristic, threatens the freedom of every individual, no matter from what race, gender, creed, or religion they originate.
[00:57:52.807 --> 00:57:54.088]  And it goes on.
[00:57:54.088 --> 00:58:00.174]  We are being systematically intimidated out of expressing our right to free speech as part of an advancement towards a new dark age of tyranny.
[00:58:00.174 --> 00:58:04.919]  We are calling on like-minded people to join us in the opt-out and film campaign.
[00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:08.623]  By the way, since we put this up last week they've removed the thing where they say you can film.
[00:58:08.623 --> 00:58:13.287]  With the understanding that you will in all likelihood face official oppression for doing so.
[00:58:14.068 --> 00:58:19.233]  The TSA is a federal agency staffed full of liars, thieves, and petty tyrants.
[00:58:19.233 --> 00:58:20.654]  We have links to the proof of that.
[00:58:20.654 --> 00:58:27.140]  Who like to harass and terrorize innocent Americans who refuse to comply.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:31.403]  With degrading treatment who refuse to partake in obedience training.
[00:58:31.403 --> 00:58:35.687]  The risk of being harassed or even arrested is there.
[00:58:35.687 --> 00:58:38.610]  But there's a bigger risk, I go on to say, of not standing up against this evil.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:50.546]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.546 --> 00:58:54.210]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:55.991]  But not all silver is equal.
[00:58:55.991 --> 00:59:02.737]  Silversol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[00:59:02.737 --> 00:59:06.140]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:14.308]  Silversol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[00:59:14.308 --> 00:59:21.435]  Silversol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[00:59:21.435 --> 00:59:26.600]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacterias, molds, and yeasts.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:33.602]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.

[00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.937]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.937 --> 01:00:05.402]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:06.702]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.702 --> 01:00:08.483]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.483 --> 01:00:10.244]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.244 --> 01:00:11.825]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.386]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.386 --> 01:00:17.548]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.548 --> 01:00:21.630]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.047 --> 01:00:31.271]  We are into our number two, ladies and gentlemen, Dulse.
[01:00:31.271 --> 01:00:35.494]  And it is the first day of October 2012.
[01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:41.359]  Coming up in the next segment, hey, I like hearing him, you like hearing him, he's on then a couple times a month.
[01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:53.868]  Max Keiser, former top stockbroker, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, virtual trading specialist, he is going to be riding shotgun right here with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:53.868 --> 01:00:54.729]  That is coming up.
[01:00:55.984 --> 01:01:01.877]  And then I'll get more into TSA rescinds approval for film in response to opt-out campaign.
[01:01:01.877 --> 01:01:05.945]  Federal agency removes webpage admitting filming is not prohibited.
[01:01:06.852 --> 01:01:11.716]  They need to engage in their color of law fraud behavior and get back to groping your wife or whatever they're into.
[01:01:11.716 --> 01:01:13.157]  You know, it's a blessing.
[01:01:13.157 --> 01:01:15.619]  It's better that they just rob our bags.
[01:01:15.619 --> 01:01:33.815]  I mean, I actually don't mind that as much as the fact that I can't fly with my wife and children because I can't let weird perverts, obvious pot-bellied perverts, who, you know, see a good-looking woman or little kids they want to go after, and they pull them out, you know, and then drag them over, and then also some of them just get off on the kids crying.
[01:01:34.918 --> 01:01:37.700]  Others like looking in diapers, especially fully loaded ones.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:46.665]  You know, you see a fully loaded diaper, they see it as like, I guess, a fully loaded baked potato or something.
[01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:48.927]  They want to get in there and, I guess, eat it.
[01:01:48.927 --> 01:01:54.270]  But, you know, the feces, I'm sorry, I've just been thinking about the TSA workers.
[01:01:54.270 --> 01:02:00.194]  You know, that'd be a good image, a TSA worker with a diaper, like it's a taco, you know, and just going after it.
[01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:02.255]  They like ripping colostomy bags off all the time.
[01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:03.676]  I mean, I'm telling you, they like it.
[01:02:04.795 --> 01:02:08.957]  I mean, I think it's better when they just want to rob our backs.
[01:02:08.957 --> 01:02:10.097]  I mean, that wouldn't be as bad.
[01:02:10.097 --> 01:02:12.218]  It's like another... It's a government tax, you know?
[01:02:12.218 --> 01:02:13.478]  Government does that.
[01:02:13.478 --> 01:02:20.621]  Maybe the TSA could have a machine that grabs you by the ankles and shakes the change out, you know?
[01:02:20.621 --> 01:02:26.823]  And then they could cattle prod you every time you had a quarter in your pocket, because that's... They could say that the image of Al-Qaeda is on a quarter.
[01:02:26.823 --> 01:02:28.084]  They're like, that's George Washington.
[01:02:28.084 --> 01:02:30.104]  They go, no, it's not, conspiracy theorist.
[01:02:30.104 --> 01:02:31.765]  And then they apply more electricity
[01:02:34.275 --> 01:02:35.157]  You know what I'm realizing?
[01:02:35.157 --> 01:02:38.625]  Everybody's like, man, some people that work here have been listening to me for like 10 years.
[01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.209]  They go, Alex, this sounds like the old you.
[01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:43.817]  Because there's not stinking cameras in here because we're doing the construction.
[01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.131]  I guess there are cameras, but we got them turned off.
[01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:52.054]  I tell you, by the way, CJ, the new doors you've put in, the whole crew is just so wonderful.
[01:02:52.054 --> 01:02:53.815]  They do the best job they can.
[01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:56.297]  And they do a pittance.
[01:02:56.297 --> 01:02:58.698]  A pittance.
[01:02:58.698 --> 01:02:59.259]  Oh, there you go.
[01:02:59.259 --> 01:03:02.521]  TSA stands by officers after patting down an elderly woman in Florida.
[01:03:02.521 --> 01:03:07.904]  They removed her fully loaded adult diaper, I remember that, and inspected it.
[01:03:07.904 --> 01:03:09.105]  There's something in your diaper.
[01:03:09.105 --> 01:03:11.586]  Yes, sir, I've been defecating.
[01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:12.887]  Well, what's that?
[01:03:12.887 --> 01:03:13.868]  Well, it's what you eat.
[01:03:16.149 --> 01:03:18.551]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:18.551 --> 01:03:22.313]  I'm just a little bit out of control today.
[01:03:22.313 --> 01:03:25.216]  You know, I don't drink Starbucks coffee for a reason.
[01:03:25.216 --> 01:03:28.098]  I like drinking rutamina because it's strong, but it doesn't send me into this.
[01:03:28.098 --> 01:03:30.179]  That's definitely ought to be a Schedule 3 drug.
[01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:36.023]  About 6 a.m., I had a big Starbucks hot coffee, and then I went for a jog and then a swim.
[01:03:36.023 --> 01:03:40.166]  And I mean, I literally, it's like I'm on methamphetamine right now.
[01:03:40.166 --> 01:03:42.108]  And I've taken methamphetamine twice.
[01:03:43.530 --> 01:04:00.516]  Back in high school, you know, I was never a drug guy, but you'd be at a party, I tried a few things a few times, never did hard drugs again because they were always so horrible, and you'd feel like crazy for two days, and then could not sleep, and then vomit for another day, and I'm like, I tried it once, and they go, hey, y'all try it again, this is good stuff this time.
[01:04:00.516 --> 01:04:02.317]  I go, okay, I'll try it.
[01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:03.958]  Absolutely horrible again.
[01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:09.320]  I can't imagine how people are on that stuff, but that's about what I feel like now from that Starbucks coffee.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.721]  Everybody in there, raise your hands if you think they put something in Starbucks coffee.
[01:04:14.239 --> 01:04:16.201]  Everybody's raising their hands.
[01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:18.582]  Oh, Chris is raising his... Everybody's raising their hands.
[01:04:18.582 --> 01:04:20.203]  I told my wife, I go, do not buy this.
[01:04:20.203 --> 01:04:22.465]  She's the one that introduced me to Riddle Mile like 10 years ago.
[01:04:22.465 --> 01:04:23.526]  It's a great Austin coffee.
[01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:29.970]  They're not a sponsor, but I'm actually trying to... Actually, they did buy a little ad in the magazine, but that's what I've been drinking for 10 years, and it doesn't do this to me.
[01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:32.412]  I don't become like, you know, there's Dr. Jekyll.
[01:04:32.412 --> 01:04:33.653]  Well, Mr. Hyde's here.
[01:04:33.653 --> 01:04:35.754]  Look out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:35.754 --> 01:04:40.958]  I gotta curb my tongue, though, because I can talk like a sailor on leave, and I need to watch it.
[01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:43.420]  I need to watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[01:04:44.878 --> 01:04:45.518]  I need to watch it.
[01:04:45.518 --> 01:04:48.240]  You know, the only cure for Starbucks is Jack Daniels.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.681]  I'm just joking.
[01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:50.782]  Maybe I'm not.
[01:04:50.782 --> 01:04:52.483]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:52.483 --> 01:04:53.163]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:55.665]  Oh yeah, the worldwide transmission's coming up.
[01:04:55.665 --> 01:04:57.586]  Max Keiser's gonna nail it.
[01:04:57.586 --> 01:04:59.007]  Max, strap yourselves in.
[01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:07.258]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:05:07.258 --> 01:05:09.860]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:15.246]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:19.951]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:05:20.211 --> 01:05:27.858]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[01:05:27.858 --> 01:05:31.722]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:33.524]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:05:33.524 --> 01:05:37.547]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[01:05:37.547 --> 01:05:40.150]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:43.212]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:05:43.212 --> 01:05:47.774]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[01:05:47.774 --> 01:05:48.435]  Don't wait!

[01:07:22.395 --> 01:07:24.676]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:07:24.676 --> 01:07:27.177]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:07:28.237 --> 01:07:29.778]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:07:29.778 --> 01:07:31.179]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:07:31.179 --> 01:07:34.341]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:37.743]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:07:37.743 --> 01:07:41.885]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:07:41.885 --> 01:07:44.627]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.188]  It's what my family uses.
[01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:49.510]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:55.053]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:57.336]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:07:57.336 --> 01:08:04.364]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:08:04.364 --> 01:08:04.844]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:08:37.148 --> 01:08:39.369]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[01:08:39.369 --> 01:08:42.769]  You'll fire musket, but I'll run you through!
[01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:48.071]  And when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back!
[01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:51.752]  The bugle sounds, the charge begins!
[01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.032]  But on this battlefield, no one wins!
[01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:06.814]  I want to say hi to all the military listening to us.
[01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:09.079]  This is the number one show inside the U.S.
[01:09:09.079 --> 01:09:09.580]  military.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.884]  Period.
[01:09:11.884 --> 01:09:14.189]  Everybody I talk to in the military.
[01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:16.533]  In fact, I was just talking to a medical doctor.
[01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:21.829]  Just the other day, well, McBrain was, to be technical.
[01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:24.532]  And he was telling him, yeah, I just got back from Afghanistan.
[01:09:24.532 --> 01:09:26.955]  I was there for a couple years, Iraq, before that.
[01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:30.058]  He goes, all the troops listened to was Alex Jones.
[01:09:30.058 --> 01:09:35.445]  He goes, because it's forbidden, it's foreboden to listen to Infowars.
[01:09:35.445 --> 01:09:36.546]  It is evil.
[01:09:37.387 --> 01:09:40.771]  So of course the troops know to listen to it.
[01:09:40.771 --> 01:09:43.133]  We know you're more informed than the general public.
[01:09:43.133 --> 01:09:45.656]  We know you understand what life and death is.
[01:09:45.656 --> 01:09:46.557]  None of you are perfect.
[01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:47.498]  I'm not perfect either.
[01:09:47.498 --> 01:09:51.563]  But at least you're living in the real world and you've got guts and guts is enough.
[01:09:52.594 --> 01:09:57.598]  And I just hope you get back safe under these banker wars and you don't have to take all those vaccines.
[01:09:57.598 --> 01:10:08.426]  They can make you take a regular vaccine, but if it's an experimental vaccine, not approved, which is almost everything they're giving you, the smallpox, the anthrax, you can and we'll say no.
[01:10:08.426 --> 01:10:10.848]  Others have battled these things for 20 years.
[01:10:10.848 --> 01:10:13.030]  All the court rulings are there.
[01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:18.755]  You've just got to go show them the backlog, which they know it's not the law for you to take all this stuff.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.564]  And then they'll be forced to back off without trying to court-martial you.
[01:10:22.564 --> 01:10:23.966]  That's a side issue.
[01:10:23.966 --> 01:10:33.477]  I just constantly confirm, when military gets back, including family, you name it, that... I mean, the military's listening to us worldwide.
[01:10:33.477 --> 01:10:35.460]  That's amazing, the responsibility we have.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.102]  I just... I just...
[01:10:38.504 --> 01:10:43.425]  I just can't believe we have, I don't know, it's over 15 million people listening one way or another a week now.
[01:10:43.425 --> 01:10:45.245]  It's just growing exponentially.
[01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:47.025]  But you know why I think the show's exploding?
[01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:52.306]  For all my problems, and I am obnoxious, I interrupt because my brain's always moving so fast.
[01:10:52.306 --> 01:11:00.428]  For all of it, I am real, and I love liberty, and I love humanity, and I am absolutely dedicated to smashing the globalists.
[01:11:00.428 --> 01:11:03.248]  And I think that's what resonates with those of you that are awake.
[01:11:03.248 --> 01:11:06.609]  And I just love you all, and I am so honored to be here talking to you.
[01:11:08.569 --> 01:11:10.711]  And I do the best job I can.
[01:11:10.711 --> 01:11:11.732]  So thank you for joining us.
[01:11:11.732 --> 01:11:14.934]  Let me just tell you some of the news coming up today before we go to Max Keiser.
[01:11:14.934 --> 01:11:19.237]  Gold set to break 1800 barrier on endless QE inflation fears.
[01:11:19.237 --> 01:11:24.581]  Kurt Nemo, or King Nemo, that's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:27.003]  I don't know, last time I checked, gold was up like eight bucks.
[01:11:27.003 --> 01:11:28.004]  I don't know what it is right now.
[01:11:29.265 --> 01:11:37.011]  We'll also get into more of the TSA rescinds approval to film in response to opt-out campaign that we have launched.
[01:11:37.011 --> 01:11:39.113]  Go read the full details of that.
[01:11:39.113 --> 01:11:43.717]  Also, more and more TSA agents being convicted in some cases of stealing right up at a cool million.
[01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:45.978]  And they say, hey, we all do it.
[01:11:45.978 --> 01:11:46.759]  We're addicted.
[01:11:46.759 --> 01:11:47.900]  It's so much fun.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.081]  Some like to grope women.
[01:11:49.081 --> 01:11:51.943]  Others like drugs, prescription drugs.
[01:11:51.943 --> 01:11:53.244]  Others like jewelry.
[01:11:54.105 --> 01:11:56.768]  I mean, hell, they take gold and silver down front of you and pocket it.
[01:11:56.768 --> 01:11:58.569]  I mean, it's just a total takeover.
[01:11:58.569 --> 01:11:59.790]  What on?
[01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:02.213]  It's the season of evil.
[01:12:02.213 --> 01:12:03.874]  It's hell gone to seed.
[01:12:03.874 --> 01:12:05.696]  It's degeneracy gone to seed.
[01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:05.976]  Why?
[01:12:05.976 --> 01:12:08.278]  Because the good men and women stood down.
[01:12:08.278 --> 01:12:09.560]  And what filled the vacuum?
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.661]  Every form of trash.
[01:12:12.274 --> 01:12:13.595]  So that's coming up.
[01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:18.357]  Also got a bunch of medical news we're going to be getting to as soon as I find that stack.
[01:12:18.357 --> 01:12:21.899]  It's pretty bombshell info that I haven't gotten to yet on that front.
[01:12:21.899 --> 01:12:27.482]  But if you go to InfoWars.com, there is a ton of important information up there, including
[01:12:29.252 --> 01:12:33.295]  Video of TSA drill at Sky Harbor goes viral.
[01:12:33.295 --> 01:12:38.139]  TSA hired, defrocked Camden Priest without background check.
[01:12:38.139 --> 01:12:39.340]  No, no, no, no.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.762]  We actually broke that six months ago.
[01:12:41.762 --> 01:12:46.566]  They hired him and ran the background check to get a defrocked person.
[01:12:46.566 --> 01:12:47.907]  They want the criminals.
[01:12:47.907 --> 01:12:49.329]  Okay, I understand that.
[01:12:49.329 --> 01:12:53.132]  Fed sends thank you letters to Congress for letting them destroy our economy in secret.
[01:12:53.932 --> 01:12:55.995]  Big government conspiracy theories become reality.
[01:12:55.995 --> 01:12:59.459]  Fluoride, cancer, chemicals and more.
[01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:01.361]  France set to ban the words mother.
[01:13:01.361 --> 01:13:02.402]  This was in the news last week.
[01:13:02.402 --> 01:13:03.484]  It's back in the news.
[01:13:03.484 --> 01:13:05.286]  And father saying they're hateful.
[01:13:05.286 --> 01:13:07.969]  Folks, you get arrested in England for saying the word homosexual.
[01:13:07.969 --> 01:13:09.971]  That's a scientific name like heterosexual.
[01:13:10.759 --> 01:13:12.560]  You're not even allowed to say the racial names.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.581]  They're now saying Caucasoid is racist towards whites.
[01:13:16.581 --> 01:13:19.281]  It just means you're from Caucasus Mountains.
[01:13:19.281 --> 01:13:20.782]  Same thing.
[01:13:20.782 --> 01:13:24.663]  If you use the word associated with black people, it just means Nigeria.
[01:13:24.663 --> 01:13:25.343]  Or in Spanish...
[01:13:28.064 --> 01:13:29.305]  You know what the word for black is.
[01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:31.626]  You can't even use words now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:31.626 --> 01:13:32.786]  They've destroyed those.
[01:13:32.786 --> 01:13:35.368]  Mother and father are now hurtful, so they're banned.
[01:13:35.368 --> 01:13:36.448]  Oh boy, I'm not joking.
[01:13:36.448 --> 01:13:37.889]  That's London Telegraph, Associated Press.
[01:13:37.889 --> 01:13:42.831]  So we're going to be going over all of that today and more, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:45.173]  Now, Max Keiser of Max Keiser.
[01:13:45.173 --> 01:13:47.053]  That means king in German.
[01:13:47.053 --> 01:13:49.695]  The king of exposing the fraudulent stock market.
[01:13:49.695 --> 01:13:51.676]  He's here with us, former top stockbroker.
[01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:58.232]  Invented many of the virtual trading systems out there, used worldwide, the Hollywood Stock Exchange, you name it.
[01:13:58.232 --> 01:14:00.213]  He joins us, always a popular guest.
[01:14:00.213 --> 01:14:02.094]  He'll be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:14:02.094 --> 01:14:04.615]  He's over in, I guess, all beyond in Britannia now.
[01:14:04.615 --> 01:14:07.376]  He's moved from the Frenchy area over to the...
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:14.663]  Over there to England, I guess he's an Anglophile now, and he's on with us.
[01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:19.307]  Max, you know, I'm pretty wound up today, as you know, my compadre, but so much is going on.
[01:14:19.307 --> 01:14:21.689]  What is QE Unlimited going to do?
[01:14:21.689 --> 01:14:24.992]  We're seeing what you predicted start to happen.
[01:14:24.992 --> 01:14:30.156]  If you want to make any adjustments to your April total implosion date, again, I want you to answer this question.
[01:14:30.156 --> 01:14:32.078]  What does total collapse mean?
[01:14:32.078 --> 01:14:33.759]  You never really define that fully.
[01:14:33.759 --> 01:14:36.802]  You start going into statements about gulags and people strapped
[01:14:37.082 --> 01:14:41.767]  Forcibly to video games in slave camps, which they do do in China.
[01:14:41.767 --> 01:14:44.209]  LA Times headline, slay 50 dragons to go free.
[01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:45.230]  People think I'm joking.
[01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.932]  I know this sounds insane to new listeners, folks.
[01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:48.594]  Reality is insane.
[01:14:48.594 --> 01:14:49.535]  There's so much more going on.
[01:14:49.535 --> 01:14:51.977]  And then what else is on your radar today?
[01:14:51.977 --> 01:14:52.598]  Max Keiser.
[01:14:53.203 --> 01:14:54.043]  All right, Alex.
[01:14:54.043 --> 01:14:54.924]  Great to be with you.
[01:14:54.924 --> 01:15:00.367]  Yeah, I'm sticking to my target 26 weeks to go.
[01:15:00.367 --> 01:15:02.068]  Total breakdown.
[01:15:02.068 --> 01:15:04.829]  Things are unfolding pretty much as I expected.
[01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:08.771]  Total breakdown would be currency collapse.
[01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:11.112]  And you mentioned gold approaching $1,800.
[01:15:12.273 --> 01:15:13.614]  That's not really the big story.
[01:15:13.614 --> 01:15:18.936]  The big story is that gold has hit this week an all-time high in euro.
[01:15:18.936 --> 01:15:21.777]  It's hit an all-time high in rupee.
[01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:24.518]  It's hit an all-time high in Swiss franc.
[01:15:24.518 --> 01:15:29.219]  And if you look what's happening in Iran, I just sent you a story, their currency has collapsed by 20%.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.441]  In one day.
[01:15:31.441 --> 01:15:33.323]  This is part of the currency wars.
[01:15:33.323 --> 01:15:34.744]  This is World War 3.
[01:15:34.744 --> 01:15:35.625]  We're in it right now.
[01:15:35.625 --> 01:15:37.227]  It started in really 2008-2009.
[01:15:37.227 --> 01:15:40.550]  This is a race to the bottom.
[01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:48.819]  All the big countries are trying to get out of their economic downturns by debasing the value of their fiat paper money.
[01:15:48.819 --> 01:15:52.063]  Gold and silver have been tracking ever higher.
[01:15:52.943 --> 01:15:55.964]  And so that is very much in play.
[01:15:55.964 --> 01:16:05.428]  So a currency collapse is what I mean when I say you have, or hyperinflation is another word for it, between now and 26 weeks from now.
[01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:15.732]  And it's coming out every day that the amount of debts that the banks have been hiding are increasing exponentially.
[01:16:15.732 --> 01:16:18.713]  And so this requires ever more money printing.
[01:16:18.713 --> 01:16:21.674]  So it's just more of the same, but we're definitely getting
[01:16:21.894 --> 01:16:25.030]  To the, to the timeline, you know, when they print all that money, Alex.
[01:16:26.072 --> 01:16:32.194]  They try to make sure that it doesn't end up making the price of food and energy go up too fast.
[01:16:32.194 --> 01:16:37.036]  So a lot of, you know, you have to understand these wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and around the world.
[01:16:37.036 --> 01:16:40.037]  This is how they get rid of a lot of the excess dollars.
[01:16:40.037 --> 01:16:50.641]  They get rid of it by dumping it in these countries in terms of war, because there's no cheaper way to get rid of money than to drop bombs and be in a war.
[01:16:50.641 --> 01:16:53.522]  So that's the deflationary offset to all the money printing.
[01:16:53.522 --> 01:16:54.062]  But even so,
[01:16:54.802 --> 01:16:59.146]  They still can't keep the price of gold from hitting all-time highs in all these major currencies.
[01:16:59.146 --> 01:17:03.310]  The new all-time high in gold and dollar will be shortly coming.
[01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.911]  Same thing for silver.
[01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:08.274]  And we've got, you know, more of the same.
[01:17:08.274 --> 01:17:12.999]  I mean, it's just, it's playing out pretty much as I've expected it would.
[01:17:15.316 --> 01:17:20.559]  Okay, and the general public, Max, literally doesn't know what planet they're on.
[01:17:20.559 --> 01:17:33.066]  Some people are waking up more, but what do you expect the yuppies to do, the ones that'll stand around and laugh at people like you or I for living on the real planet, when things begin to really unravel?
[01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:41.250]  Will they, when the government says that those of us criticizing the government are at fault, because that's already started, will the yuppies demand our heads, or what will happen?
[01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:42.331]  Or will they just suck their thumbs?
[01:17:43.564 --> 01:17:51.069]  Well, people are going to be sucking their thumbs, as you say, but on the margin, on the periphery, there's real economic collapse.
[01:17:51.069 --> 01:17:54.911]  People in Greece are suffering a massive depression.
[01:17:54.911 --> 01:17:57.973]  People in Spain are now suffering a massive depression.
[01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:04.817]  You know, I mentioned on your show a year ago that the crisis in Europe would progress in the order that the countries are vulnerable.
[01:18:05.217 --> 01:18:06.517]  And that generally means size.
[01:18:06.517 --> 01:18:12.038]  It's no coincidence that Greece and Ireland and Portugal were the first to be taken over by the banksters.
[01:18:12.038 --> 01:18:23.881]  And now with the profits they made destroying those economies, and remember this has made banksters incredible amounts of billions and billions of euros destroying these countries, they now have the war chest to take on a country like Spain.
[01:18:23.881 --> 01:18:34.703]  Once Spain is now in the crosshairs, Spain will soon join Greece and demand a bailout and in exchange they will forego their sovereignty after Spain will come Italy.
[01:18:35.003 --> 01:18:46.358]  And the bailout always goes to the bankers, 90% of it, who then use it to bring down the next country, while the media goes along with the hoax that the bailouts actually go into the people and that they're to blame.
[01:18:46.358 --> 01:18:48.180]  I mean, the ultimate psyop.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:52.285]  Lies within lies, covered with more lies, and then still more lies.
[01:18:53.226 --> 01:18:56.550]  The federalization, you've heard that term for the Eurozone.
[01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:00.074]  These countries are all coming under the auspices of the IMF, World Bank.
[01:19:00.074 --> 01:19:02.537]  Oh, here's a fantastic story from this week.
[01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:09.485]  The World Health Organization is introducing a global tax on cigarettes.
[01:19:10.106 --> 01:19:17.250]  This to me is the first tangible proof of this new world order concept in terms of global taxation.
[01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:21.773]  World Health Organization, global tax on cigarettes, this is the beginning.
[01:19:21.773 --> 01:19:29.657]  Because the Eurozone, as it collapses, there will be a necessity to create a new global central bank to roll up all the European debt.
[01:19:29.657 --> 01:19:30.118]  That's right.
[01:19:30.698 --> 01:19:43.347]  That's right, and stay there, we gotta go to break, but you're right, Max, they always globally demonize cigarettes, which is reasonable, on the surface, to first ban smoking in bars, then on the street, then in your house, then to tax what's left.
[01:19:43.347 --> 01:19:48.350]  This was always to be the first global UN tax, and then it'll be on everything else.
[01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:59.918]  They're gonna, through our smart cards, track all the things we eat, everything we do will be penalized for our carbon footprint, for thousands of different items, with the control freak state tracking everything we do.

[01:22:58.409 --> 01:23:03.713]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:07.554]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.554 --> 01:23:16.524]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:21.450]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:33.426]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[01:23:41.108 --> 01:23:45.411]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:23:45.411 --> 01:23:49.014]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:49.014 --> 01:23:51.956]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:23:51.956 --> 01:23:56.279]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:23:56.279 --> 01:23:57.560]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.641]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:23:58.641 --> 01:24:02.944]  Tell all the folks
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:18.663]  Find your humanity, find your resistance that all creatures have that aren't slaves.
[01:24:18.663 --> 01:24:31.130]  And get up on your hind legs like a badger, like a grizzly bear, and stop bowing down to government that's involved in a revolution of hen-pecking the population into submission.
[01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:34.732]  All over the world!
[01:24:34.732 --> 01:24:41.056]  The control freaks and their minions are hen-pecking us socially to get us in line to be dominated.
[01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:48.803]  Non-criminal populations are being taught to behave like criminals and be treated like criminals.
[01:24:48.803 --> 01:24:49.744]  That's all this is.
[01:24:49.744 --> 01:24:54.787]  In fact, police all over the country admit they're told to take a mom in if her seatbelt isn't on.
[01:24:54.787 --> 01:24:56.127]  Get people in jail.
[01:24:56.127 --> 01:24:57.388]  Get them in the system.
[01:24:57.388 --> 01:24:58.269]  Get them used to it.
[01:24:59.059 --> 01:24:59.719]  This is it.
[01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:00.740]  A criminal takeover.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:09.626]  Max Keiser, I know you talk about the gulag archipelago, the casino gulag, but getting back into the global collapse, you got interrupted by the break when you were getting into Barroso.
[01:25:09.626 --> 01:25:21.074]  People can type in federalization of Europe into news and they can just see three weeks ago the president of the EU Commission, Barroso, saying we're getting rid of sovereignty.
[01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:23.375]  I mean, it's all quoted.
[01:25:23.375 --> 01:25:25.777]  They're on TV saying it.
[01:25:25.777 --> 01:25:27.618]  They're bragging they've conquered Europe.
[01:25:27.618 --> 01:25:28.519]  They've conquered us.
[01:25:29.439 --> 01:25:31.880]  And the bankers say they want to bankrupt us.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.622]  Why do the bankers, the mega bankers, want to make us so poor?
[01:25:35.622 --> 01:25:37.463]  Max Keiser.
[01:25:37.463 --> 01:25:41.765]  It's an axiomatic truth that the poorer they make us, the richer they get.
[01:25:41.765 --> 01:25:44.326]  And they're doing a good job getting richer.
[01:25:44.326 --> 01:25:45.447]  You know, look at Ireland.
[01:25:45.447 --> 01:25:47.268]  Here's a story I just sent it to you.
[01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:51.730]  In Ireland, they have a bank there, the Anglo-Irish Bank.
[01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:52.891]  It's 99.8% owned by the taxpayer.
[01:25:55.652 --> 01:26:12.083]  They were just forced to make a 1 billion euro bond payment, that's unsecured bond payment, for the banksters, on behalf of the banksters, and that 1 billion dollar liability is now going to have to be borne by the citizens.
[01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:25.532]  Now, these bonds are unsecured bonds, and when the people were in these deals originally, it says clearly on the covenant of the bond, this bond is very risky, it's unbacked, it's unguaranteed, you may lose everything.
[01:26:25.872 --> 01:26:31.876]  But the government is completely corrupt with the banksters and they're forcing this billion dollar wealth transfer.
[01:26:31.876 --> 01:26:34.838]  This is on top of the Anglo-Irish wealth transfer.
[01:26:34.838 --> 01:26:40.421]  Billions of dollars transferred so that people in Ireland are leaving in droves.
[01:26:40.421 --> 01:26:41.882]  Thousands, tens of thousands.
[01:26:42.062 --> 01:26:47.945]  People are leaving Ireland like they have historically before the boom years of the 90s.
[01:26:47.945 --> 01:26:49.526]  Same is true of these other countries.
[01:26:49.526 --> 01:26:56.049]  So the people are now migrants roaming the world with no place to go, no jobs, and they're being picked off.
[01:26:56.049 --> 01:27:04.814]  You know, they end up going into the airport, the TSA is waiting for them, they've lost all their jobs in their home country, and they end up being funneled into the prison system.
[01:27:05.094 --> 01:27:09.683]  Or they work for pennies a day and now they're serfs.
[01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:13.932]  And it's all quite calculated and makes a few people extraordinarily wealthy.
[01:27:13.932 --> 01:27:14.332]  No doubt!
[01:27:17.546 --> 01:27:19.869]  And there's just no end to it.
[01:27:19.869 --> 01:27:27.136]  What do you make of Monsanto and Bill Gates and the banks all invested and that Prop 37 poll show is going to pass 2-1?
[01:27:27.136 --> 01:27:32.122]  Will that hurt Monsanto if we're allowed to actually read what's in the food?
[01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:38.489]  Or will the feds, as Obama has said, sign an executive order just countermanding the state government?
[01:27:39.634 --> 01:27:47.341]  I love the headlines on Monsanto this past week, you know, the floods that swept through and washed out so many crops.
[01:27:47.341 --> 01:27:55.849]  The corporate-owned media had the headline that, thank God these crops are Monsanto seeds and they survived the floods.
[01:27:56.770 --> 01:28:00.853]  In fact, more than if they were not genetically modified seeds.
[01:28:00.853 --> 01:28:12.563]  So never mind the fact that the business practices of these companies to begin with are directly the result leading to the destabilization of all these networks, which leads the problem to begin with.
[01:28:12.563 --> 01:28:15.385]  You know, Monsanto is part of the corporate mafia.
[01:28:15.385 --> 01:28:16.806]  They own the media.
[01:28:16.806 --> 01:28:20.389]  So their media spin is always going to be positive.
[01:28:20.389 --> 01:28:21.710]  They are one of the deadliest.
[01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:23.872]  You know, I did a survey five, six years ago.
[01:28:24.312 --> 01:28:27.173]  What people thought was the deadliest company in the world.
[01:28:27.173 --> 01:28:30.414]  I thought Exxon would be number one, but in fact, Monsanto.
[01:28:30.414 --> 01:28:33.375]  Monsanto is the most hated company in the world.
[01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:37.797]  You know, going back to Agent Orange and the Vietnam War, right up through Terminator.
[01:28:37.797 --> 01:28:38.137]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:28:38.137 --> 01:28:44.819]  Before that, they would dump deadly docks and one drop basically kills you and bury it secretly in black neighborhoods.
[01:28:45.723 --> 01:28:51.405]  Yeah, no, this is really the most evil, you know, company listed.
[01:28:51.405 --> 01:28:57.106]  But if you want to buy, unfortunately, there are people who are making money buying into evil.
[01:28:57.106 --> 01:29:06.169]  So they buy Monsanto stock, they buy prison, Corrections Corps of America stock, and they buy the equity in the companies that are doing this gulag casino.
[01:29:06.889 --> 01:29:08.230]  Well, I gotta hand it to RT Russia today.
[01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:09.171]  Apparently they're gonna do a one-year
[01:29:27.226 --> 01:29:28.888]  We're on the march.
[01:29:28.888 --> 01:29:30.289]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.088 --> 01:30:00.873]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.873 --> 01:30:01.894]  Aaron Fullon here.
[01:30:01.894 --> 01:30:13.483]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:30:13.483 --> 01:30:17.326]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:30:17.526 --> 01:30:20.288]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:30:20.288 --> 01:30:28.172]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[01:30:28.172 --> 01:30:35.676]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:30:35.976 --> 01:30:37.097]  But here's some good news.
[01:30:37.097 --> 01:30:43.322]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[01:30:43.322 --> 01:30:46.644]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:30:46.644 --> 01:30:49.486]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[01:30:49.486 --> 01:30:51.508]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[01:31:00.915 --> 01:31:04.397]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.

[01:31:22.609 --> 01:31:26.251]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

[01:31:45.622 --> 01:31:48.264]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.

[01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:14.860]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.801]  Mother!
[01:33:18.723 --> 01:33:21.745]  Tell your children not to walk my way.
[01:33:21.745 --> 01:33:25.127]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[01:33:25.127 --> 01:33:27.748]  What they need was to say, Mother.
[01:33:27.748 --> 01:33:33.251]  Mother!
[01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:36.793]  Can you keep them in the dark for life?
[01:33:36.793 --> 01:33:41.476]  Can you hide them from the wayward world?
[01:33:41.476 --> 01:33:42.857]  Oh, Mother!
[01:33:42.857 --> 01:33:46.319]  Father!
[01:33:50.175 --> 01:33:53.756]  I'm going to show her my world!
[01:33:53.756 --> 01:33:54.217]  Yeah!
[01:34:01.633 --> 01:34:05.396]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, transmitting worldwide.
[01:34:05.396 --> 01:34:10.100]  I am Alexander Emmerich Jones of Austin, Texas.
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.621]  And I love freedom.
[01:34:11.621 --> 01:34:12.382]  What about you?
[01:34:12.382 --> 01:34:17.506]  Yeah, the New World Order, they take your children, they're going to show them their world.
[01:34:17.506 --> 01:34:21.369]  Vaccines, cancer viruses, GMO.
[01:34:21.369 --> 01:34:24.451]  Mommy and daddy aren't allowed to pack your lunch.
[01:34:24.451 --> 01:34:26.013]  They serve government.
[01:34:26.013 --> 01:34:27.614]  They serve the state.
[01:34:27.614 --> 01:34:29.956]  And we're going to give you an Obama phone, honey.
[01:34:31.377 --> 01:34:33.499]  Going back to Max Keiser, finish up with him on Santa.
[01:34:33.499 --> 01:34:47.775]  I want to get your take on the Obama phone lady, and how they again destroy the industry, ship the jobs overseas, and then many people pretty much only have a future if it's on welfare, but then attached to that are these wastelands
[01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:50.996]  And the government says, oh, now we'll take control of your food.
[01:34:50.996 --> 01:35:01.000]  But, oh, Big Sis' friend, Mrs. Sotero, Mrs. Obama, Michelle, she says she's going to decide what you eat now.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.201]  And now nationwide, the feds say, Mama and Daddy don't pack that lunch anymore, Max.
[01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:07.362]  I guess, I mean, what do you expect?
[01:35:07.362 --> 01:35:09.823]  They admit the prices are going up on the food.
[01:35:09.823 --> 01:35:11.303]  They're going to decide what you eat.
[01:35:11.303 --> 01:35:13.424]  But they say GMO's good.
[01:35:13.424 --> 01:35:15.945]  They're just going to tell you no sugar or fat, Max Keiser.
[01:35:17.762 --> 01:35:20.665]  Well, you know, I don't live over there.
[01:35:20.665 --> 01:35:29.516]  That's one of the reasons is that it's hard to get decent food for all the problems that we have here in Europe.
[01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:31.598]  The food is not one of them at the moment.
[01:35:31.598 --> 01:35:34.601]  You know, they have the Common Agricultural Policy, for example, in France.
[01:35:35.342 --> 01:35:41.125]  Which means that you have a plethora of fantastic food at your fingertips.
[01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:44.126]  But in the U.S., that's a huge problem.
[01:35:44.126 --> 01:35:46.867]  It leads to obesity and starvation at the same time.
[01:35:46.867 --> 01:35:51.369]  There's a billion obese people in the world, just like there's a billion starving people in the world.
[01:35:51.369 --> 01:35:56.892]  It's both the result of malnutrition, both the result of faulty economics.
[01:35:56.892 --> 01:36:00.053]  And so that's two sides of the same problem.
[01:36:00.053 --> 01:36:02.314]  And Monsanto wants to turn seed
[01:36:02.754 --> 01:36:13.490]  And so currency and they wanted therefore manipulate the currency just like any bank on Wall Street wants to manipulate the currency market in any country in any region or the bond market or the option market once you turn
[01:36:14.714 --> 01:36:19.139]  I mean, that would mean people could eat nature's bounty without having to pay a monthly nature tax.
[01:36:36.438 --> 01:36:51.570]  Or restrict and ban vitamins and minerals, feed you debilitating food, so you've got to pay the military industrial complex, pharmacological complex, money just to stay alive, and then they've got it actuaried out to kill you as soon as they've sucked the money out of you.
[01:36:52.671 --> 01:37:02.359]  I mean, I'm not big on quoting scripture, but one phrase that did catch my eye was, look at the lilies in the field, they neither spin nor toil, said by Jesus.
[01:37:02.359 --> 01:37:16.109]  Now, meaning, as I understand it, that the plants are not out there, you know, working a nine-to-five job that you need to pay them as part of some economy that's manipulated and governed by outside forces and banksters.
[01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.870]  It's a bounty.
[01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:18.151]  It's nature's bounty.
[01:37:18.151 --> 01:37:22.314]  It's providing for us if we simply have the humility to accept
[01:37:22.634 --> 01:37:23.994]  And you can't allow that.
[01:37:23.994 --> 01:37:30.737]  Monsanto's got to add insect genes and pesticide to the crops so they spread into other species and poison everything.
[01:37:30.737 --> 01:37:36.819]  Right, they monetize the seeds that don't need to be monetized because it's perfect as it is.
[01:37:36.819 --> 01:37:44.481]  No, they get in the middle, they intermediate this seed business and that's why 2,000 farmers a month, or is it a day, in India
[01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:45.721]  Commit suicide.
[01:37:45.721 --> 01:37:47.982]  Monsanto completely puts them out of business.
[01:37:47.982 --> 01:37:53.384]  With the poison they drink the herbicide to get rid of themselves because it's all they have left.
[01:37:53.384 --> 01:38:01.368]  And they also point out that all that herbicide runs off through the Mississippi down into the Gulf and kills all the fish.
[01:38:01.368 --> 01:38:04.689]  So now the fish are dead to go along with your dead plants.
[01:38:04.989 --> 01:38:06.571]  So, where do you get your food?
[01:38:06.571 --> 01:38:09.094]  Oh, well, you have synthetic meat we make in the laboratory.
[01:38:09.094 --> 01:38:10.116]  It wiggles like meat.
[01:38:10.116 --> 01:38:11.458]  It's pink slime.
[01:38:11.458 --> 01:38:15.302]  It's something that smells like meat, but it's made in a laboratory.
[01:38:15.302 --> 01:38:17.025]  It has no nutrition whatsoever.
[01:38:17.025 --> 01:38:19.328]  It'll either make you obese or you'll starve to death.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.043]  And used to maybe every hundred years there'd be a red tide.
[01:38:23.043 --> 01:38:26.826]  Now the Texas coast, you can't go down there half the time because it's like nerve gas.
[01:38:26.826 --> 01:38:28.747]  I was down there once when it was happening.
[01:38:28.747 --> 01:38:30.929]  I was literally sick for weeks after.
[01:38:30.929 --> 01:38:33.692]  People were, animals were dying from it.
[01:38:33.692 --> 01:38:34.953]  Birds were dead.
[01:38:34.953 --> 01:38:38.075]  Millions of fish that I could see dead everywhere.
[01:38:38.075 --> 01:38:42.739]  And I went and looked it up and scientists have proven it's all the herbicide coming out.
[01:38:42.739 --> 01:38:43.120]  But there's
[01:38:44.286 --> 01:38:46.549]  And it doesn't even work like they say it will.
[01:38:46.549 --> 01:38:48.432]  I mean, it's just pure fraud.
[01:38:59.206 --> 01:39:00.307]  We're good to go.
[01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:33.111]  Now Spain is being taken out to the woodshed and put two caps in the back of their head.
[01:39:33.111 --> 01:39:34.452]  Then it'll be Italy!
[01:39:34.452 --> 01:39:36.094]  Italy has 2,400 tons of gold.
[01:39:36.094 --> 01:39:43.239]  Well, we'll take your gold, and we'll take everything else, but now you're part of the dead group of European nations.
[01:39:43.239 --> 01:39:44.340]  So it progresses in this way.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.161]  The U.S.
[01:39:45.161 --> 01:39:48.744]  and the United Kingdom will be the last two to fall because the U.S.
[01:39:48.744 --> 01:39:51.206]  has the world reserve currency and in the U.K.
[01:39:51.206 --> 01:39:52.927]  is the global center for bank fraud.
[01:39:52.927 --> 01:39:58.893]  The bank fraud keeps this country alive and kicking and will be one of the last countries to collapse.
[01:39:58.893 --> 01:39:59.493]  And the U.S.
[01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:04.417]  of course has the world reserve currency and of course these two countries have the so-called special relationship.
[01:40:04.417 --> 01:40:07.180]  So these two will probably be the last two to fall.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:12.744]  After Spain, after Italy, then I think you've got to look at Japan, as I've mentioned before.
[01:40:12.744 --> 01:40:13.905]  It's extremely vulnerable.
[01:40:13.905 --> 01:40:16.167]  They've got 200% debt to GDP.
[01:40:16.167 --> 01:40:19.730]  They're 100% reliant on energy coming to them from overseas.
[01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:23.653]  Energy prices like gold and silver will skyrocket as the currency collapses.
[01:40:23.653 --> 01:40:27.116]  So then you have the second biggest economy in the world, then collapse.
[01:40:27.116 --> 01:40:29.078]  Then you've got a fiat currency collapse.
[01:40:29.078 --> 01:40:31.159]  Now we're heading into January of next year.
[01:40:31.159 --> 01:40:33.822]  Then we're talking to Alex Jones, and we're heading into April.
[01:40:33.822 --> 01:40:35.523]  We're getting closer to my timeline.
[01:40:35.723 --> 01:40:42.588]  A massive global currency collapse, hyperinflation, gold at $5,000, at $10,000 an ounce, and it's all playing out in real time.
[01:40:42.588 --> 01:40:46.110]  And the people who benefit the most are the same people who are benefiting now.
[01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:48.392]  Corporate insiders, banksters.
[01:40:48.392 --> 01:40:49.452]  You know, it's not government.
[01:40:49.452 --> 01:40:51.374]  Government left the building long ago.
[01:40:51.374 --> 01:40:52.935]  There is no representational government.
[01:40:52.935 --> 01:40:55.016]  It's dead, buried, and left in the 70s.
[01:40:55.016 --> 01:40:59.419]  We just have corporations and banksters, and they're just wholesale thieving.
[01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:05.191]  And what happens next?
[01:41:05.191 --> 01:41:16.241]  I mean, is there, I mean, the bankers, why would Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others, every time I turn on Bloomberg shows where they have all these insiders on Bloomberg radio,
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:29.509]  Whenever I read the Financial Times of London or you name it, I mean, I can pull the articles up right now where the foreign editor sits there and says, yes, it's tyrannical and we're getting rid of freedom and it's authoritarian.
[01:41:29.509 --> 01:41:30.750]  It's for your own good.
[01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:34.252]  And of course, Bilderberg runs everything.
[01:41:34.252 --> 01:41:36.874]  And yes, we've conquered Europe and we're going to conquer you.
[01:41:36.874 --> 01:41:43.199]  And I mean, it's just and then, you know, you get FBI training manuals.
[01:41:43.199 --> 01:41:46.662]  And I mean, I got one last week that's from like six months ago.
[01:41:47.236 --> 01:41:52.762]  And it says, if anyone that says there's a world government is insane and dangerous, look out.
[01:41:52.762 --> 01:42:06.739]  So I don't get how the public can be so dumb that in hundreds of financial papers, I know you read them, Max, they're bragging how they conquered the world, the bankers run everything, ha ha ha, they get on the shows, and I've heard them talk about Europe, how they're taking down one...
[01:42:07.439 --> 01:42:15.142]  One country after another and how they're even going to get rid of the sports teams that are named after countries and name them after mascots because that's too nationalistic.
[01:42:15.142 --> 01:42:19.384]  And they say it doesn't matter what Europe tries or Japan, we'll just hold them hostage.
[01:42:19.384 --> 01:42:20.984]  And then they snicker and giggle.
[01:42:20.984 --> 01:42:23.245]  It's like a criminal group parading around.
[01:42:23.245 --> 01:42:27.006]  Did you see that Israel lobby guy?
[01:42:27.006 --> 01:42:31.928]  Everybody knows, folks, I don't get into this nationalistic, you know, hate Israel, love Israel stuff.
[01:42:31.928 --> 01:42:33.709]  All these countries are corrupt and out of control.
[01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:36.150]  But he got up there last week on C-SPAN.
[01:42:36.946 --> 01:42:48.231]  And then they put it on their website, they're proud of it, and said, we need to stage a Gulf of Tonkin or another event to start a war with Iran to blame it on them.
[01:42:48.231 --> 01:42:53.173]  And, I mean, why brag about committing crimes on TV?
[01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:57.515]  Is this just them letting us know that there's no end to it?
[01:42:57.515 --> 01:43:02.277]  I mean, will they start, you know, will the government start barbecuing children?
[01:43:02.277 --> 01:43:05.138]  I mean, that's about all they haven't done yet in front of us or something.
[01:43:06.178 --> 01:43:10.180]  Well, you have interesting developments at the highest levels.
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:26.187]  For example, Sheila Baer, who was the former top regulator at the FDIC, she just came out with a big book and media tour where she says that the entire TARP program, remember during 2008 with Hank Paulson, was designed
[01:43:26.847 --> 01:43:29.089]  Only to bail out Citibank.
[01:43:29.089 --> 01:43:31.831]  There was no economic justification for it.
[01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:41.617]  The crisis had been fabricated to hide the fact that, you know, it was kind of a financial false flag, to hide the fact the Citigroup was insolvent, so they needed to be bailed out.
[01:43:41.617 --> 01:43:45.680]  So now you have Sheila, and she names Tim Geithner as the villain in the piece.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.764]  So now you've got two very high-level people who are at war very publicly.
[01:43:51.184 --> 01:44:10.932]  So I think the difference now between even six months ago, or even maybe even three months ago, is that the very top insiders, even people who identify themselves as Republican or Conservative, are coming out and attacking people like the Tim Geithners, who, on your show, with people like myself or Solente, you know, we've been talking about Tim Geithner for several years now.
[01:44:11.292 --> 01:44:22.519]  As coming from the New York Fed, who then ends up as a Treasury Secretary, who got a direct line to Bob Rubin, former Goldman Sachs guy, who then was the Treasury with Alan Greenspan.
[01:44:22.519 --> 01:44:25.621]  You know, that clique of inside and banking guys.
[01:44:25.621 --> 01:44:31.864]  And now there is a war happening at the very top echelons, because there is no solution.
[01:44:31.864 --> 01:44:35.226]  Let me break it down another way, which I can't take credit for.
[01:44:35.226 --> 01:44:37.888]  I read this on another site, but I think it's really, really smart.
[01:44:38.508 --> 01:44:42.934]  Typically there's two ways to approach economic fixes.
[01:44:42.934 --> 01:44:46.197]  You've got the Keynesian model where you go into deficit spending.
[01:44:47.048 --> 01:44:51.050]  And then you have this Milton Friedman model where you're printing money, monetarism.
[01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:54.891]  In this crisis, you've got historic excesses on both sides.
[01:44:54.891 --> 01:45:01.854]  You've got the most deficit spending by any country in the history of the world already happening in the U.S.
[01:45:01.854 --> 01:45:06.296]  and you also have the most money printing of any country in the history of the world.
[01:45:06.296 --> 01:45:11.058]  They're doing these two things simultaneously at historic levels and yes,
[01:45:11.658 --> 01:45:20.785]  They just came out with a report saying that the GDP estimate for the next quarter has been revised down to less than 1.5%.
[01:45:20.785 --> 01:45:25.489]  Less than 1.5% means the economy is at stall speed.
[01:45:25.489 --> 01:45:31.774]  Stall speed means that if you're in an airplane, you have to go a certain speed or the plane falls to the ground.
[01:45:32.154 --> 01:45:39.341]  An economy needs at least 1.5% growth to stay aloft, to escape just a complete and utter collapse.
[01:45:39.341 --> 01:45:48.490]  It's now drifting below that 1.5% stall speed, which indicates, as I've been saying now and I'm holding to my prediction over the next 28 weeks of hyperinflation,
[01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:52.152]  Yeah, that's what tells me the big implosion is coming.
[01:46:11.005 --> 01:46:18.729]  Max is because when they start blaming each other, which they never want to do, because they want to keep everybody, you know, snowed under so the thieving can happen.
[01:46:18.729 --> 01:46:27.034]  It looks like they want to give Geithner or Bernanke the hand grenade when the chairs stop.
[01:46:27.034 --> 01:46:28.315]  Is my instinct right on that?
[01:46:29.341 --> 01:46:39.083]  Yeah, well I think that exactly is a case where they realize that nothing is working and they're looking for scapegoats.
[01:46:39.083 --> 01:46:42.904]  And they can't, the public has had it.
[01:46:42.904 --> 01:46:48.005]  The public can't, we can't squeeze the public anymore, especially in these European countries.
[01:46:48.005 --> 01:46:51.026]  You've already impoverished them, they're on the streets and they're
[01:46:51.666 --> 01:46:53.808]  They're scrounging for food.
[01:46:53.808 --> 01:46:55.989]  You can't twist that turnip anymore.
[01:46:55.989 --> 01:46:56.590]  The U.S.
[01:46:56.590 --> 01:47:02.474]  already has record unemployment, record numbers of food stamps, record number of poverty rates.
[01:47:02.474 --> 01:47:05.917]  There's only, there's not much more you can squeeze out of the U.S.
[01:47:05.917 --> 01:47:07.037]  population.
[01:47:07.037 --> 01:47:12.161]  So they have to, they're admitting failure at this point, and they're going after each other.
[01:47:12.161 --> 01:47:13.062]  And this is predictable.
[01:47:13.703 --> 01:47:22.125]  And I think I agree with you that it is a clear sign that the timeline is now compressing to a very near horizon.
[01:47:23.632 --> 01:47:37.658]  Well, all I know is government is running around digging in, buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammo, armored vehicles, wheeled tanks, deploying warrior vehicles, Bradleys, caches of them.
[01:47:37.658 --> 01:47:43.261]  Both in the news and my sources are saying, you know, they're gearing up for absolute bedlam.
[01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:48.543]  Now, I'm not saying this is absolutely going to happen, because they can always come up with new scams, new tricks.
[01:47:48.543 --> 01:47:52.044]  They may start a big war, which somehow puts this off.
[01:47:52.044 --> 01:47:52.745]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:47:53.505 --> 01:47:55.106]  I just know there's... We're in a war right now.
[01:47:55.106 --> 01:47:56.848]  It's a currency war.
[01:47:56.848 --> 01:48:03.113]  And to get back to what we were saying a little bit earlier, you see what's happening in the Eurozone.
[01:48:03.113 --> 01:48:07.756]  All the bad debts for these countries are being swapped for central bank paper.
[01:48:07.756 --> 01:48:13.021]  But of course, that means this new central bank that's been created starts life stillborn.
[01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:18.885]  It starts life dead on arrival and needs to be bailed out by, well, who's going to bail out the Eurozone?
[01:48:18.885 --> 01:48:22.188]  There's only one possible way, and that would be to create a global reserve bank.
[01:48:22.668 --> 01:48:24.308]  And we've talked about this before.
[01:48:24.308 --> 01:48:29.650]  And then you're going to have the Global Reserve Bank swapping all the bad debt in Europe along with the bad debt in Japan.
[01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:33.611]  And then levying all these carbon taxes and cigarette taxes on us.
[01:48:33.611 --> 01:48:38.572]  You're going to have to pay a global tax, just like you pay federal, state, local tax.
[01:48:38.572 --> 01:48:45.454]  You're going to have to pay a global tax to support the Global Reserve Bank to pay for the maintenance of these debts that are being rolled up into this.
[01:48:45.454 --> 01:48:47.295]  They said it at Davos three years ago.
[01:48:47.295 --> 01:48:49.495]  They want to create a new facility that's $100 trillion.
[01:48:51.916 --> 01:48:54.837]  In funding to absorb the global debt.
[01:48:54.837 --> 01:48:59.517]  Well, how are they going to pay for that unless you exert a global tax to pay for that?
[01:48:59.517 --> 01:49:04.858]  And we see it last week with the introduction of a global cigarette tax.
[01:49:04.858 --> 01:49:08.279]  I mean, again, the bankers brag that they've captured Europe.
[01:49:08.279 --> 01:49:09.619]  They've captured America.
[01:49:09.619 --> 01:49:10.979]  They're going to shut down free speech.
[01:49:10.979 --> 01:49:12.300]  They're going to take over the web.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.920]  They're going to arrest whoever they want.
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.420]  This is the sickening plan.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:19.401]  But simultaneously, they have the Southern Property Law Center, ADL, FBI.
[01:49:20.101 --> 01:49:28.047]  And Nightline and MSNBC saying anyone that says mega banks are setting up world government is evil and horrible and it doesn't exist.
[01:49:28.047 --> 01:49:30.089]  How are they going to juxtapose the two?
[01:49:30.089 --> 01:49:41.658]  Because as you pointed out over a year ago, it's on screen now, we played the clips here, London Telegraph, world needs 100 trillion more credit says World Economic Forum, but they mean 100 trillion to them.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.841]  And then we've got to back it up with our taxes.
[01:49:46.841 --> 01:49:50.163]  How do they expect Pete to get away with this much?
[01:49:50.163 --> 01:49:54.645]  Because, sure, they've got the prostitute media, Max, but not for long.
[01:49:54.645 --> 01:49:58.967]  I mean, let me... They used the same tactic they used in 2008.
[01:49:58.967 --> 01:50:01.109]  Hank Paulson showed how to do it.
[01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:02.789]  He threatened martial law.
[01:50:02.789 --> 01:50:08.532]  And that gave him, remember, three quarters of a trillion dollars to bail out Citigroup, according to Sheila Bair, just this past week.
[01:50:08.532 --> 01:50:09.653]  He threatened martial law.
[01:50:09.653 --> 01:50:11.334]  That's now in the public record.
[01:50:11.334 --> 01:50:13.195]  Originally, Congress rejected it.
[01:50:13.675 --> 01:50:15.757]  The next day, they crashed the market.
[01:50:15.757 --> 01:50:16.818]  How did they crash the market?
[01:50:16.818 --> 01:50:24.905]  As I've explained on your show many times, markets are not driven by price discovery, where buyers and sellers come together to establish a mutually beneficial price.
[01:50:24.905 --> 01:50:25.385]  No.
[01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:32.692]  Computers create a price first, and then the volume comes in later to make it look like that price was natural and organic.
[01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:40.579]  They are manipulating the price, so they simply pick a price which is 20 or 30 percent below the closing price from the day before, they turn the computers on,
[01:50:40.959 --> 01:50:45.885]  Sure, so they're gonna hold us hostage.
[01:50:45.885 --> 01:50:47.226]  Stay there and finish up on that.
[01:50:47.226 --> 01:50:49.168]  Let me put you on the spot here, Max.
[01:50:49.168 --> 01:50:50.730]  I know it's night over there.
[01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:52.973]  Can you do 20 minutes in the next hour to take phone calls?
[01:50:53.928 --> 01:50:55.189]  I just, uh, I'm ready, man.
[01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.690]  I'm ready.
[01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:56.010]  I'm ready.
[01:50:56.010 --> 01:50:57.451]  All right, he's locked in.
[01:50:57.451 --> 01:51:00.073]  Max Keiser on target, over the target.
[01:51:00.073 --> 01:51:00.974]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.974 --> 01:51:07.579]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:51:07.579 --> 01:51:10.162]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:51:10.162 --> 01:51:15.206]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:51:15.546 --> 01:51:20.509]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:51:20.509 --> 01:51:28.153]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[01:51:28.153 --> 01:51:32.035]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:51:32.035 --> 01:51:33.816]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:51:33.816 --> 01:51:37.838]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[01:51:37.838 --> 01:51:40.440]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:43.522]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[01:51:43.522 --> 01:51:48.085]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[01:51:48.085 --> 01:51:48.725]  Don't wait!
[01:51:48.725 --> 01:51:50.446]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:51:50.446 --> 01:51:52.207]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:51:52.207 --> 01:51:53.728]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[01:52:02.711 --> 01:52:07.793]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:07.793 --> 01:52:09.934]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:52:09.934 --> 01:52:13.576]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:52:13.576 --> 01:52:18.058]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[01:52:18.058 --> 01:52:21.180]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:25.782]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:52:25.782 --> 01:52:31.785]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:52:32.125 --> 01:52:34.026]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:52:34.026 --> 01:52:42.291]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:52:42.291 --> 01:52:45.333]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[01:52:45.333 --> 01:52:47.735]  So get one for you and one for a loved one.
[01:52:47.735 --> 01:52:50.737]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[01:52:50.737 --> 01:52:56.480]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.081]  Faketv.com.
[01:52:58.081 --> 01:52:59.362]  The burglar deterrent.
[01:53:00.253 --> 01:53:03.396]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you.
[01:53:03.396 --> 01:53:07.860]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:09.582]  Here's the really bad news.
[01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:16.128]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[01:53:16.128 --> 01:53:24.816]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[01:53:25.296 --> 01:53:27.478]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[01:54:06.826 --> 01:54:07.927]  You got Obama phone?
[01:54:07.927 --> 01:54:08.388]  Yes!
[01:54:08.388 --> 01:54:11.891]  Everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone!
[01:54:11.891 --> 01:54:14.494]  Keep Obama in President, you know?
[01:54:14.494 --> 01:54:15.855]  He gave us a phone!
[01:54:15.855 --> 01:54:16.556]  He gave you a phone?
[01:54:16.556 --> 01:54:17.537]  He's gonna do more!
[01:54:17.537 --> 01:54:18.978]  How'd he give you a phone?
[01:54:18.978 --> 01:54:24.604]  You chiding up, you on full stamps, you on Social Security, you got low income, you disability!
[01:54:24.604 --> 01:54:25.425]  I have a question.
[01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:27.307]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[01:54:27.307 --> 01:54:28.789]  Romney, he sucks!
[01:54:28.789 --> 01:54:28.869]  Hey!
[01:54:31.692 --> 01:54:32.273]  Obama!
[01:54:32.273 --> 01:54:33.275]  You got Obama phone?
[01:54:33.275 --> 01:54:33.656]  Yes!
[01:54:33.656 --> 01:54:35.019]  Everybody in Cleveland!
[01:54:35.019 --> 01:54:35.339]  All right.
[01:54:35.339 --> 01:54:36.321]  Minority got Obama phone!
[01:54:36.321 --> 01:54:40.410]  We're going to take 20 minutes of your calls in the next hour ahead of a big news blitz.
[01:54:43.015 --> 01:54:46.276]  We're going to be, again, taking your phone calls.
[01:54:46.276 --> 01:54:48.177]  Your questions for Max Keiser.
[01:54:48.177 --> 01:54:50.138]  He's our guest.
[01:54:50.138 --> 01:54:56.081]  We don't screen your phone calls here, but when we have a guest on, it's a question for them on economics or whatever question you have for Max.
[01:54:56.081 --> 01:54:56.721]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:56.721 --> 01:54:57.761]  We'd love to hear from you.
[01:54:57.761 --> 01:54:57.841]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:57.841 --> 01:54:58.702]  First-time callers.
[01:54:58.702 --> 01:54:59.162]  Let's do that.
[01:55:06.305 --> 01:55:09.287]  800-259-9231.
[01:55:09.287 --> 01:55:11.629]  Max, what do you expect?
[01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:13.731]  I want you to finish your World Government comment.
[01:55:13.731 --> 01:55:14.932]  What do you expect?
[01:55:14.932 --> 01:55:20.736]  Because the globalists only want to have the welfare hordes at first to vote for the big governments.
[01:55:20.736 --> 01:55:21.337]  They can have them.
[01:55:22.257 --> 01:55:29.639]  As a threat to riot, as Paulson threatened Congress, he said the welfare people will burn the cities to the ground, blood will run in the streets, tanks will be in the streets.
[01:55:29.639 --> 01:55:31.180]  That's congressional testimony.
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:33.980]  I'm paraphrasing it, but that's almost word for word.
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:34.380]  You're right.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:35.641]  They've got the gun to our head.
[01:55:35.641 --> 01:55:37.341]  They brag about it on Bloomberg.
[01:55:37.341 --> 01:55:43.183]  I've heard them many times on those roundtable shows with the heads of big companies laughing.
[01:55:43.883 --> 01:55:46.744]  And I guess that's the downfall of criminals is they love to brag.
[01:55:46.744 --> 01:55:56.829]  When I was a kid, I'd watch, you know, old movies about criminals, old black and white movies like Humphrey Bogart and stuff and think, oh, criminals don't brag to the guy they're about to kill.
[01:55:56.829 --> 01:55:57.709]  Criminals don't.
[01:55:57.709 --> 01:56:06.993]  And the more I learn as an adult, I go, wow, these movies are actually how things are because because I've noticed criminals love to brag.
[01:56:06.993 --> 01:56:07.993]  What is that, Max?
[01:56:07.993 --> 01:56:08.914]  And what do you expect?
[01:56:09.674 --> 01:56:20.678]  The welfare crowds to do, you know, if their check gets hyperinflated or their, you know, their welfare card still has the credits put on it but won't buy anything anymore.
[01:56:20.678 --> 01:56:24.440]  I mean, what do you expect to unfold?
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:33.202]  Well, we see it happening in Europe, and as I said before, it's going to happen in the U.S., but it's being delayed because the U.S.
[01:56:33.202 --> 01:56:38.404]  has a world reserve currency, which means at the moment food and energy prices are not as high as they are in these other countries.
[01:56:38.404 --> 01:56:42.925]  You know, once food gets to 40% or more of your budget, you tend to have a revolution.
[01:56:42.925 --> 01:56:49.527]  That's what we had in Cairo, and that's what we had across the north of Africa, and historically that's the number to look for.
[01:56:49.827 --> 01:56:54.890]  Right now in America, food is about 15-16% of the budget of the average household.
[01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:56.170]  It's creeping up every day.
[01:56:56.170 --> 01:57:01.933]  And once it gets to 40%, look out for a major uprising.
[01:57:01.933 --> 01:57:10.478]  I think once gas gets over $6.50 to $7 a gallon would also be a major trigger point, which would stir the mob.
[01:57:10.478 --> 01:57:14.140]  But it's going to be an uprising for Obama phones is the problem.
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:23.545]  If the welfare classes aren't asking for freedom or jobs or industry, and they're asking for more welfare, it's just going to be a hellish situation.
[01:57:23.545 --> 01:57:25.426]  It's just going to be chaos.
[01:57:25.426 --> 01:57:34.890]  I don't think there's going to be a real strong movement and organization that's going to affect the regime change.
[01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:39.493]  It's going to be a mob, and it's going to be out of control, and it's going to be nasty.
[01:57:39.913 --> 01:57:40.513]  I agree with you.
[01:57:40.513 --> 01:57:41.013]  Stay there.
[01:57:41.013 --> 01:57:42.154]  MaxKaiser.com.
[01:57:42.154 --> 01:57:43.574]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[01:57:43.574 --> 01:57:49.237]  And before he leaves, I'm going to ask him again, just in 60 seconds, what will the collapse look like?
[01:57:49.237 --> 01:57:54.979]  I mean, if it starts accelerating in April, how long will it take until we're like Argentina?
[01:57:55.759 --> 01:58:03.622]  Or, not just Greece now, Spain they're rioting and robbing the grocery stores and police are attacking and beating people to death and things are burning.
[01:58:03.622 --> 01:58:13.065]  I mean, it's only the beginning of the fun to bring in the new world lord of the birthing pains to give birth to the abomination, desolation, TSA agent creature.
[01:58:13.065 --> 01:58:16.687]  Now, before I go any further, just briefly, I haven't plugged anything yet today.
[01:58:18.088 --> 01:58:27.115]  Please go to Infowarsstore.com, whether it's ProPure water filters discounted, or a subscription to Infowars Magazine, or to buy them in bulk at cost.
[01:58:27.115 --> 01:58:30.478]  Can't really say support the show by buying the magazine, because it is at cost.
[01:58:30.478 --> 01:58:31.579]  Support the truth.
[01:58:31.579 --> 01:58:32.840]  Get hard copies of this.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:35.702]  The new technocracy issue is so important.
[01:58:35.702 --> 01:58:38.064]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:38.064 --> 01:58:41.567]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.567 --> 01:58:43.269]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.916 --> 01:58:57.079]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:58:57.079 --> 01:59:00.041]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:05.424]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:59:05.424 --> 01:59:10.386]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:59:10.386 --> 01:59:17.710]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:21.893]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices, too.
[01:59:21.893 --> 01:59:23.694]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:59:23.694 --> 01:59:27.697]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:59:27.697 --> 01:59:30.619]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[01:59:30.619 --> 01:59:33.400]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:37.964]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[01:59:37.964 --> 01:59:38.604]  Don't wait!
[01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:40.505]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.283]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.283 --> 01:59:59.047]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.666 --> 02:00:10.508]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.508 --> 02:00:12.089]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.089 --> 02:00:13.629]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:17.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.811 --> 02:00:25.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.234 --> 02:00:28.835]  Gold's up nine dollars right now.
[02:00:28.835 --> 02:00:31.837]  Two million in gems and gold stolen from California Museum.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:36.764]  Man, I see articles every day about big museum heists and stuff.
[02:00:36.764 --> 02:00:41.209]  Man, you know things are going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:00:41.209 --> 02:00:41.910]  Man, I tell you.
[02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:43.171]  Well, lock and load, folks.
[02:00:43.171 --> 02:00:44.853]  Just blast anybody trying to rob you.
[02:00:44.853 --> 02:00:46.895]  Uh, going back to, uh...
[02:00:48.257 --> 02:00:49.137]  Good morning everybody.
[02:00:49.137 --> 02:00:50.498]  I'd like to ask Max a quick question if I could.
[02:00:50.498 --> 02:00:52.759]  I'm getting ready to go with a family member of mine before
[02:01:15.197 --> 02:01:18.742]  Uh, her financial advisor at Edward D. Jones.
[02:01:18.742 --> 02:01:22.007]  And I'm gonna attempt to get most of her money out and put it into gold and silver.
[02:01:22.907 --> 02:01:26.728]  Can you give me a couple of bullet points that I can bring up with that man?
[02:01:26.728 --> 02:01:31.049]  I don't think you have to argue anything with that turd.
[02:01:31.049 --> 02:01:39.051]  Any financial advisor that acts like your money is his or your family's is his, look, you instruct them on what to do, but I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[02:01:39.051 --> 02:01:45.232]  I'm in gold and silver and a little bit of private property and food and guns and trying to take care of my family.
[02:01:45.232 --> 02:01:47.332]  And I'm in information warfare.
[02:01:47.332 --> 02:01:48.433]  But I know your question's for Max.
[02:01:48.433 --> 02:01:49.033]  I'm sorry, Max.
[02:01:49.033 --> 02:01:49.273]  Go ahead.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:52.123]  Yeah, it's for me, man!
[02:01:52.123 --> 02:02:05.680]  Anyway, well, open an account somewhere else first, and have the new account at the new location send your current broker a transfer form, a 1090 or ACAT.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:07.562]  I was in the business for many years, so I know how this works.
[02:02:08.283 --> 02:02:10.526]  Uh, and then they take it out of your hands.
[02:02:10.526 --> 02:02:12.047]  You don't need to even go see the guy.
[02:02:12.047 --> 02:02:18.794]  Just open a new account, a small account to get it started and have a new firm that you're going to invest in gold and silver.
[02:02:18.794 --> 02:02:22.358]  Uh, send your current firm a transfer form.
[02:02:22.358 --> 02:02:27.664]  And then when the broker calls us as what's going on, just say, Hey buddy, thanks for everything, but I'm moving on.
[02:02:28.547 --> 02:02:33.088]  And then don't listen to their sales pitch for 10 hours.
[02:02:33.088 --> 02:02:34.048]  I wouldn't take everything.
[02:02:34.048 --> 02:02:36.529]  If you're already in the stock market, I own zero stocks.
[02:02:36.529 --> 02:02:42.610]  I personally, if you had stocks, things you know about, things you like, I would not do everything at once.
[02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:47.871]  I would research it first, and I would personally buy gold and silver at bullion prices.
[02:02:47.871 --> 02:02:52.693]  You know, 1%, 2% above spot is all you should be paying, because obviously we're capitalists.
[02:02:52.693 --> 02:02:54.353]  Whoever's handling it's got to make a little bit of money.
[02:02:55.533 --> 02:02:56.714]  Uh, take Midas Resources.
[02:02:56.714 --> 02:03:08.639]  They make their money by buying when it's low, hoarding it in vaults, and then when gold goes up, they sell it at discounted prices, uh, but then are able to make a profit, uh, because gold has gone up.
[02:03:08.639 --> 02:03:09.600]  Gold and silver.
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:13.301]  Like, they're in a big profit phase right now, thank God, because they fund the network and they're great guys.
[02:03:13.301 --> 02:03:15.442]  Uh, but that's how that works.
[02:03:15.442 --> 02:03:17.623]  Uh, but anything else, sir?
[02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:18.504]  I don't want to hear anything.
[02:03:18.504 --> 02:03:22.666]  Yeah, hey, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I talk about my new silver product?
[02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:25.093]  Sure, Max.
[02:03:25.093 --> 02:03:27.837]  I've got a new one-ounce Silver Kaiser.
[02:03:27.837 --> 02:03:30.320]  It just launched a week ago.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.244]  And the thing about this new Silver Kaiser, it's a one-ounce coin.
[02:03:33.244 --> 02:03:36.228]  It says, Global Insurrection Against Banker Occupation.
[02:03:36.228 --> 02:03:37.790]  This is made with 100% recycled silver.
[02:03:39.873 --> 02:03:47.536]  And this is important because there's a lot of silver out there that's not accounted for, and we want to get it off the market as quickly as possible.
[02:03:47.536 --> 02:03:49.756]  So we want to get the demand for this up.
[02:03:49.756 --> 02:03:56.699]  And listen, Max, by the way, you know, the big cardinal rule is obviously I have my gold and silver sponsor.
[02:03:56.699 --> 02:03:57.379]  You do what you do.
[02:03:57.379 --> 02:04:00.740]  But what your thing is so important about busting J.P.
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:04.081]  Morgan, you've got to talk to Ted Anderson at Midas Resources.
[02:04:04.081 --> 02:04:06.762]  He carries all sorts of specialty silver rounds.
[02:04:07.443 --> 02:04:08.143]  In fact, you know what?
[02:04:08.143 --> 02:04:10.527]  Go get Ted right now in here during the break.
[02:04:10.527 --> 02:04:11.388]  Let's talk to Kaiser.
[02:04:13.251 --> 02:04:20.015]  Get him, get him, I'll tell you what, we'll get him on, we'll get him on in the next segment, but I gotta go to calls because I promised.
[02:04:20.015 --> 02:04:27.239]  Go find Ted, let's get him on at 20 after, we'll talk to Kaiser, because I'm telling you, we're not commies, and I love your silver coin.
[02:04:27.239 --> 02:04:41.208]  In fact, I meant to even, months ago when you launched that, when I first saw it, I wanted, I meant to call Ted and say, hey, carry those, because we carry the Lakotas, everything, every little specialty goody, and absolutely, those go for a lot in the aftermarket, and I believe in it, so.
[02:04:42.168 --> 02:04:45.272]  We need to get MinusResources.com carrying Kaisers.
[02:04:45.272 --> 02:04:46.593]  So, uh, that's it for that.
[02:04:46.593 --> 02:04:49.796]  Alright, we'll, uh, come back.
[02:04:49.796 --> 02:04:52.820]  I know, folks, we don't make money off government bailouts and stuff.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:55.102]  We actually, you know, sell stuff we believe in.
[02:04:55.102 --> 02:04:57.725]  It's... It's what built America, and it's horrible.
[02:04:57.725 --> 02:04:58.346]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.087 --> 02:05:06.589]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:09.010]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:05:09.010 --> 02:05:18.094]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:21.556]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:05:21.556 --> 02:05:23.217]  There's no priming required.
[02:05:23.217 --> 02:05:25.497]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:05:25.497 --> 02:05:27.999]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:05:29.059 --> 02:05:30.600]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.020]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:35.181]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:05:35.181 --> 02:05:38.563]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:05:38.563 --> 02:05:42.704]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:05:42.704 --> 02:05:45.445]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:05:45.445 --> 02:05:47.006]  It's what my family uses.
[02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:50.327]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:05:50.327 --> 02:05:55.589]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[02:05:58.731 --> 02:06:04.535]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[02:06:04.535 --> 02:06:06.316]  But not all silver is equal.
[02:06:06.316 --> 02:06:13.061]  Silversol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[02:06:13.061 --> 02:06:16.464]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[02:06:16.804 --> 02:06:24.632]  Silversol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[02:06:24.632 --> 02:06:31.759]  Silversol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[02:06:31.759 --> 02:06:36.924]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacterias, molds, and yeasts.
[02:06:37.404 --> 02:06:43.927]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.
[02:06:43.927 --> 02:06:49.870]  Silverstone liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.

[02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:11.671]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:21.756 --> 02:08:26.743]  I'm Alex Jones, I love freedom, and yes, I'm a maniac.
[02:08:26.743 --> 02:08:30.669]  People that lie down and lick boots didn't build civilization.
[02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:38.399]  Boot licking allows the lowest form of scum to take over and set up hierarchical systems of domination and control freak activities.
[02:08:40.526 --> 02:08:42.107]  I am angry about the New World Order.
[02:08:42.107 --> 02:08:52.254]  I am angry about world government, and so is my friend Max Keiser, financial advisor, retired stockbroker, inventor of stock exchange computer systems, like the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[02:08:52.254 --> 02:08:57.938]  We're taking your phone calls right now, then big news blitz coming up on a host of stuff I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:08:57.938 --> 02:08:59.839]  My head is spinning right now.
[02:08:59.839 --> 02:09:05.903]  Keiser is predicting global financial meltdown, engineered, and it's starting.
[02:09:05.903 --> 02:09:07.424]  A global banking takeover.
[02:09:07.424 --> 02:09:10.206]  They're announcing $100 trillion in global government taxes.
[02:09:10.666 --> 02:09:12.448]  They plan to put on us in the next decade.
[02:09:12.448 --> 02:09:14.350]  That's mainstream news.
[02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:18.393]  They're announcing they're going to shut down free speech, arrest whoever they want.
[02:09:18.393 --> 02:09:27.222]  The bankers just brag in the Financial Times of London, in one article, now for global government, now for world government, they brag about how, yes, we're tyrants.
[02:09:27.222 --> 02:09:28.203]  You will not stop us.
[02:09:28.203 --> 02:09:28.943]  Ha ha ha.
[02:09:28.943 --> 02:09:32.447]  I mean, it is just hubris to the max right now.
[02:09:33.387 --> 02:09:35.969]  Meanwhile, the jellyfish public has been conditioned.
[02:09:35.969 --> 02:09:48.480]  Corruption doesn't exist in government, so they still are wandering around thinking government's gonna, you know, hold their hand and help them suck their thumb when the government's gonna help blow their brains out after they, you know, give them cancer injections for the vaccines.
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.200]  I'm ranting here.
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.902]  We're taking phone calls from Max Keiser.
[02:09:50.902 --> 02:09:54.885]  My Twitter is twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[02:09:54.885 --> 02:10:02.131]  It's important to follow us there because we never really got into Twitter until recently because I realize now how important it is to be able to send you photos or video clips as they develop.
[02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:10.241]  You can also sign up to get the magazine free as an e-format at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:10:10.241 --> 02:10:12.344]  People are asking, hey, I want this free.
[02:10:12.344 --> 02:10:16.429]  Why are you selling subscriptions at cost for the physical of InfoWars magazine?
[02:10:16.429 --> 02:10:17.791]  How dare you sell something?
[02:10:18.211 --> 02:10:24.516]  Is the government supposed to take my tax money and give it to George Soros or give it to MSNBC to have anti-gun shows?
[02:10:24.516 --> 02:10:27.719]  What are you doing selling something that costs you, filthy American?
[02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:28.880]  Well, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:37.768]  The point is, you can sign up at Infowars.com for a slash newsletter and get the free magazine digitally sent to you with the links working on the websites and everything.
[02:10:37.768 --> 02:10:38.288]  It's pretty neat.
[02:10:38.288 --> 02:10:42.031]  But if you want the physicals, we have them in bulk in 10 packs up to 100 packs.
[02:10:43.332 --> 02:11:00.745]  The only way to get the first issue that came out on the financial meltdown, Bankers Declare They've Conquered America, the only way to get that, because we kept like 3,000 back, is sign up for the next 12 issues, including the new Technocracy issue, the October issue that's out, and get the September issue free with that.
[02:11:00.745 --> 02:11:10.131]  So your first installment, you'll get two magazines in the mail, and it's got great graphics, great documentation, great way to wake people up, support the First Amendment, support Print 2.0.
[02:11:11.592 --> 02:11:14.575]  Again, that's infowarestore.com.
[02:11:14.575 --> 02:11:17.918]  Max, tell us your Twitter account, because there's several out there.
[02:11:17.918 --> 02:11:25.626]  I want to make sure I plug the right one for folks to follow your site, your Twitter, during Financial Armageddon.
[02:11:25.626 --> 02:11:27.788]  Yeah, this is Max Keiser, and you're right.
[02:11:27.788 --> 02:11:29.109]  You are a Twitter slowpoke.
[02:11:29.918 --> 02:11:31.699]  You are late to the Twitter part.
[02:11:31.699 --> 02:11:39.162]  I've already eclipsed your Twitter follow, one of my massive 35,000 Twitter followers, that Max Keiser on Twitter.
[02:11:39.162 --> 02:11:40.863]  And, you know, get on the Twitter, man!
[02:11:40.863 --> 02:11:41.603]  Get on the Twitter!
[02:11:41.603 --> 02:11:42.424]  That's where you gotta be!
[02:11:45.247 --> 02:11:52.614]  Well that's great, Max, but I mean, sure, sure, what is the exact, I'm still trying to get the address, what is the exact address?
[02:11:52.614 --> 02:11:53.855]  Max Keiser!
[02:11:53.855 --> 02:11:54.636]  Max Keiser!
[02:11:54.636 --> 02:11:55.297]  M-A-X-K-E-I-S-E-R!
[02:11:55.297 --> 02:11:59.901]  Okay, because there's a couple of them on there, I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm trying to find out.
[02:11:59.901 --> 02:12:00.302]  Max Keiser!
[02:12:00.302 --> 02:12:05.206]  If there's a problem in the world, just flash Max Keiser in the sky like the Batman signal!
[02:12:05.206 --> 02:12:06.387]  I'll be in there!
[02:12:06.387 --> 02:12:07.669]  Help is on the way!
[02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:09.470]  I hear you, but your Skype is not on the way.
[02:12:10.291 --> 02:12:11.172]  All right, here we go.
[02:12:11.172 --> 02:12:15.334]  Let's go ahead and he's had more coffee than I've had, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:15.334 --> 02:12:16.834]  It's that special Starbucks type.
[02:12:16.834 --> 02:12:19.636]  Let's talk to Jason in California.
[02:12:19.636 --> 02:12:20.376]  You're on the air.
[02:12:20.376 --> 02:12:21.277]  What's your question for Max?
[02:12:22.441 --> 02:12:23.801]  Hi, I love you guys.
[02:12:23.801 --> 02:12:24.822]  Been listening to you for a long time, Alex.
[02:12:24.822 --> 02:12:25.822]  You're great.
[02:12:25.822 --> 02:12:30.383]  I just had some questions on preparedness for Max.
[02:12:30.383 --> 02:12:34.484]  Your thoughts on safer cities, states, or even countries?
[02:12:34.484 --> 02:12:36.645]  Yeah, what are you doing to get physically prepared?
[02:12:36.645 --> 02:12:42.367]  Because you just left France because of their 90% tax rate and all that.
[02:12:42.367 --> 02:12:46.608]  And areas are burning and people are raiding grocery stores in Spain.
[02:12:46.608 --> 02:12:49.949]  Greece, the people are dumping their kids out on the side of the highway.
[02:12:49.949 --> 02:12:50.689]  It's a wonderful thing.
[02:12:51.349 --> 02:12:57.374]  You've now escaped to London, to Britannia, Command Base Alpha, Airstrip One.
[02:12:57.374 --> 02:13:00.095]  What are you doing physically to get ready?
[02:13:00.095 --> 02:13:02.657]  Oh, I go to the gym every day.
[02:13:02.657 --> 02:13:06.060]  And I take Tangy Tangerine, of course.
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:07.861]  It's my only supplement.
[02:13:07.861 --> 02:13:09.923]  It keeps me fit and strong.
[02:13:09.923 --> 02:13:14.586]  And I listen to Alex Jones on the iPod while I'm out in the gym pressing iron.
[02:13:14.586 --> 02:13:15.607]  That's how I stay fit.
[02:13:16.198 --> 02:13:17.459]  You do actually listen to the show.
[02:13:17.459 --> 02:13:19.041]  I've called you up before and heard it in the background.
[02:13:19.041 --> 02:13:21.023]  I'm very honored, Max, that you listen to the show.
[02:13:21.023 --> 02:13:26.168]  Did you hear the first hour where I had a little bit of a, well, an event?
[02:13:26.168 --> 02:13:27.349]  Did you hear that?
[02:13:27.349 --> 02:13:28.090]  No.
[02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:32.835]  In the first hour, you were explaining how you like to eat baby poop out of baby diapers.
[02:13:32.835 --> 02:13:35.738]  And I thought, wow, this tangy tangerine, this must be the next level.
[02:13:36.701 --> 02:13:37.722]  I did not say that.
[02:13:37.722 --> 02:13:46.709]  I said the TSA love to get into old ladies' and babies' diapers that are... Tune in to the show and here's Alex Jones saying, yeah, you know...
[02:13:48.662 --> 02:13:53.486]  It's a taco full of baby poop, and that's what I love to have with my tangy tangerine!
[02:13:53.486 --> 02:13:55.628]  That is not what I said!
[02:13:55.628 --> 02:13:56.969]  That's what I needed to hear!
[02:13:56.969 --> 02:14:01.653]  Folks, there are no fully loaded baby diapers available at Infowarshealth.com.
[02:14:01.653 --> 02:14:03.814]  I'm sorry, that is not one of my delicacies.
[02:14:03.814 --> 02:14:04.735]  I'm not into that.
[02:14:04.735 --> 02:14:08.198]  I like chile rellenos, though, loaded with vegetables.
[02:14:08.198 --> 02:14:09.479]  Let's go ahead.
[02:14:09.479 --> 02:14:10.460]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:11.340]  Okay, thank you, Jason.
[02:14:12.361 --> 02:14:20.165]  I don't usually keep Max into a second hour, because he's just as crazy as I am, and while you're hearing the effects of it, he's now degenerating.
[02:14:20.165 --> 02:14:22.287]  Steven in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:14:22.287 --> 02:14:24.928]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:14:24.928 --> 02:14:25.989]  I'm doing alright, sir.
[02:14:25.989 --> 02:14:29.371]  You know what you call one of those fully loaded diapers?
[02:14:29.371 --> 02:14:30.831]  You call it a Kaiser.
[02:14:30.831 --> 02:14:31.492]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:32.584 --> 02:14:35.907]  Alright, so I met this army officer over the weekend at a party.
[02:14:35.907 --> 02:14:38.448]  He told me how he works for Ben Bernanke.
[02:14:38.448 --> 02:14:49.496]  He told me that he knew about QE3 months before it went into effect and how they're actually expecting hyperinflation and that they're banking on a global war to bring in a global currency.
[02:14:49.496 --> 02:14:54.480]  Then I told him about the New World Order and he just called me a crazy conspiracy theorist and walked away.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.060]  Oh yeah, no, no.
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:56.421]  They admit it's global government.
[02:14:56.421 --> 02:14:57.702]  They admit they're tyrannical.
[02:14:57.702 --> 02:14:59.263]  They admit they're doing all this.
[02:14:59.263 --> 02:15:00.905]  But then when we talk about it, we're bad.
[02:15:01.912 --> 02:15:06.614]  I mean, it's like double think out of 1984, Crimestop.
[02:15:06.614 --> 02:15:09.055]  Max, can we be serious for a moment?
[02:15:09.055 --> 02:15:12.096]  What's your take on the man's statement?
[02:15:12.096 --> 02:15:12.977]  I didn't hear it.
[02:15:12.977 --> 02:15:18.479]  I just, Chris just cut in and said he was asleep at the switch and my audio was dead on the question.
[02:15:18.479 --> 02:15:21.820]  So I did not hear the question.
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:25.262]  Okay, the man was talking about somebody who works for the banksters.
[02:15:27.574 --> 02:15:28.496]  Alright, thanks.
[02:15:28.496 --> 02:15:30.580]  This is not Morning Zoo Radio, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:34.367]  Kaiser is, well, having his own episode right now.
[02:15:34.367 --> 02:15:38.334]  Caller, recap your question for Max Kaiser.
[02:15:39.474 --> 02:15:44.676]  Okay, well, so this weekend I met an Army officer who actually interned for Ben Bernanke.
[02:15:44.676 --> 02:15:49.558]  And we were just kids talking and he told me about the QE3 and I'm like, yeah, I know a lot about that.
[02:15:49.558 --> 02:15:52.399]  And he's like, yeah, they're actually banking on hyperinflation.
[02:15:52.399 --> 02:15:53.199]  I'm like, that's horrible.
[02:15:53.199 --> 02:15:56.121]  He's like, if we didn't do this, then the banks would go under.
[02:15:56.121 --> 02:16:02.683]  So he basically went on to tell me that they're actually banking on a global war in which they can bring in a global currency.
[02:16:02.683 --> 02:16:04.524]  And I was like, well, do you believe in the New World Order?
[02:16:04.524 --> 02:16:07.265]  And he's like, you're a crazy conspiracy theorist and walked away.
[02:16:07.728 --> 02:16:08.829]  Well yeah, I mean, that's it.
[02:16:08.829 --> 02:16:17.960]  They're bragging all these publications, they're conquering us through their fraud, and saying, oh, but we don't want you to go under, when really, they're not going under, they're taking over.
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:18.961]  Max, comments on that?
[02:16:19.542 --> 02:16:20.964]  Okay, this is fascinating.
[02:16:20.964 --> 02:16:23.647]  Now, I will get serious for this.
[02:16:23.647 --> 02:16:25.229]  The quantitative easing announcement.
[02:16:25.229 --> 02:16:33.619]  They are going to buy back billions of mortgage-backed securities on a monthly basis.
[02:16:33.619 --> 02:16:34.840]  Here's the fact.
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:39.626]  They could quite easily just simply retire the mortgages.
[02:16:40.307 --> 02:16:41.148]  See what I'm saying?
[02:16:41.148 --> 02:16:47.195]  They don't need to bail out the banksters who have this mortgage-backed securities, the derivatives.
[02:16:47.195 --> 02:16:50.159]  Instead of, this has been going on since 2008.
[02:16:50.159 --> 02:16:55.085]  Every time there's a need for some program to come into effect,
[02:16:55.265 --> 02:17:05.816]  Instead of giving relief to the actual people by simply, they could have gotten paid down 90% of all the mortgages in 2008 and that would have cost less than $10 trillion.
[02:17:05.816 --> 02:17:13.725]  They have spent close to $30 trillion continuing to bail out the banksters and yet the mortgage problem continues to fester and be a problem.
[02:17:13.965 --> 02:17:14.205]  Sure.
[02:17:14.205 --> 02:17:16.847]  That's the main point people need to understand.
[02:17:16.847 --> 02:17:24.774]  When Bernanke speaks, he speaks in a way that makes no sense for the average person who has been crushed by this economy.
[02:17:24.774 --> 02:17:33.822]  He continues to placate the bankers by this program, QE3, where he's bailing them out of debt by buying their bad debt.
[02:17:33.822 --> 02:17:35.323]  Let's jam in another call here.
[02:17:35.323 --> 02:17:38.445]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:17:38.445 --> 02:17:39.667]  Hey, Alex, and hey, Max.
[02:17:40.578 --> 02:17:45.121]  So my first question is for you, Alex, and then for Kaiser right after that.
[02:17:45.121 --> 02:17:53.608]  Did you hear about that bank robber in Aurora, Colorado, that they stopped every vehicle and took every person out of the vehicle?
[02:17:53.608 --> 02:17:55.770]  Yeah, with machine guns.
[02:17:55.770 --> 02:18:02.935]  Families, that was months ago, families driving up, they point machine guns at them, drug everybody out, and it was all just staged.
[02:18:02.935 --> 02:18:03.756]  That's the new thing.
[02:18:03.756 --> 02:18:09.240]  We're all prisoners anytime they want, and then cops all the time now just shoot innocent people, and it's like an act.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:10.040]  Afterthought.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:11.000]  They're just getting us ready.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.082]  Yeah, Max Keiser is... Well, you have a question for Max.
[02:18:15.082 --> 02:18:17.583]  Go ahead.
[02:18:17.583 --> 02:18:21.884]  Okay, so Max, you got your time date in April of next year, right?
[02:18:21.884 --> 02:18:26.925]  So, my question to you is, when that does collapse, what are they going to replace it with?
[02:18:26.925 --> 02:18:30.907]  What is the actual thing that they're going to have at that moment when everything comes down?
[02:18:30.907 --> 02:18:33.948]  How long are they going to let it run for before they bring up their solution?
[02:18:33.948 --> 02:18:35.148]  And what is that going to be?
[02:18:35.148 --> 02:18:36.548]  Global government, global banks.
[02:18:36.548 --> 02:18:37.509]  There you go, Keiser.
[02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:38.309]  Answer your question now.
[02:18:39.025 --> 02:18:50.702]  The currency being considered is being propagated by the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, and it's called the Special Drawing Right, or SDR.
[02:18:50.702 --> 02:18:53.887]  This is going to take the place, and all of the
[02:18:54.708 --> 02:18:59.510]  Global transactions will occur on the wholesale level in the SDR.
[02:18:59.510 --> 02:19:10.434]  The dollar will be convertible into the SDR, the global currency, but at a rate that is 70-80% less than what your purchasing power is today.
[02:19:10.794 --> 02:19:29.123]  So if you look up SDR, Special Drawing Right, it'll give you the whole story about how the IMF, which is in its own right a central bank run by Christie Lagarde, a globalist, who is now going to deputize that bank to be part of this new global multi-trillion dollar facility.
[02:19:29.123 --> 02:19:32.485]  It'll be priced in this new global currency, the SDR.
[02:19:32.485 --> 02:19:33.025]  Amen to that.
[02:19:33.625 --> 02:19:48.795]  And to define globalist, it is a world government corporatist, crony capitalist, anti-free market monopolist who believes in eugenics, or the science of taking over society and breeding the public to serve all slaves, those that they allow to kill.
[02:19:48.795 --> 02:20:00.542]  It is, to give a quicker definition, psychopathic control freak social engineers dedicated to scientific total war against humanity and mass extermination of at least 90% of the world's population.
[02:20:00.982 --> 02:20:01.563]  You didn't write that?
[02:20:01.563 --> 02:20:02.364]  No, I didn't write that.
[02:20:02.364 --> 02:20:03.525]  You didn't write that?
[02:20:03.525 --> 02:20:04.546]  You didn't write that?
[02:20:04.546 --> 02:20:06.088]  That's right, I didn't say that.
[02:20:06.088 --> 02:20:06.668]  Government did.
[02:20:06.668 --> 02:20:07.829]  You didn't say that?
[02:20:24.906 --> 02:20:26.847]  I bet I did invent the Kaiser.
[02:20:26.847 --> 02:20:27.908]  Alright, let's go.
[02:20:27.908 --> 02:20:29.389]  I'm fully loaded.
[02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:33.932]  Let's go ahead and talk to... I'm sorry, I gotta... Kaiser, stop it!
[02:20:33.932 --> 02:20:36.154]  We gotta go to Jeremy in Tennessee.
[02:20:36.154 --> 02:20:38.515]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:20:38.515 --> 02:20:40.157]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:20:40.157 --> 02:20:41.898]  I'm just thinking about a... Well, go ahead, sir.
[02:20:43.178 --> 02:21:04.315]  Alright, well this is basically just to call and tell people that if they're thinking that the TSA and these psycho cops will not delete your videos or what happened in our case, take our camera and completely vacate where they were when they were trying to arrest us for skateboarding in an apartment development.
[02:21:05.095 --> 02:21:05.715]  I don't know.
[02:21:16.055 --> 02:21:24.377]  Police officers with no name tags, just badges on their shirt, and they were undercover police officers that came and basically just started harassing us for skateboarding.
[02:21:24.377 --> 02:21:28.498]  Oh, listen, cops now stop adults in rural areas and ask what you're doing.
[02:21:28.498 --> 02:21:31.299]  You're like, I walked over to the cow pond.
[02:21:31.299 --> 02:21:32.459]  I'm walking.
[02:21:32.459 --> 02:21:33.580]  Why are you walking?
[02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:34.820]  I'm not going to answer your questions.
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:35.820]  Oh, really?
[02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:37.521]  Are you looking for somebody who looks like me?
[02:21:37.521 --> 02:21:38.121]  No.
[02:21:38.121 --> 02:21:40.041]  I'm asking you why you're walking out here.
[02:21:40.041 --> 02:21:41.262]  I mean, this is the new America.
[02:21:41.262 --> 02:21:45.263]  It's about, hey, you're my food, and I'm here to teach you to do what I say.
[02:21:45.623 --> 02:21:48.165]  Now get on your knees, you American trash!
[02:21:48.165 --> 02:21:51.367]  Now a lot of cops aren't pure criminals, so they're waking up.
[02:21:51.367 --> 02:21:54.449]  Some of them are good people, but I'm telling you, this is hidden freedom, what we're seeing.
[02:21:54.449 --> 02:21:57.771]  Do you have a question for Max Keiser, criminal?
[02:21:57.771 --> 02:21:59.032]  Um, I don't.
[02:21:59.032 --> 02:22:01.113]  I just wanted to throw that out there to let people know.
[02:22:01.113 --> 02:22:02.214]  Alright, I gotta jump.
[02:22:02.214 --> 02:22:05.116]  I appreciate your call, but we're taking calls for Max Keiser right now.
[02:22:05.116 --> 02:22:08.058]  I only have time for one more for Max Keiser.
[02:22:08.058 --> 02:22:10.199]  I skipped a break to take the calls, folks.
[02:22:10.199 --> 02:22:12.160]  Brian in California, you're on the air.
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:14.242]  How you doing?
[02:22:15.023 --> 02:22:17.124]  Oh, I'm doing pretty damn good right now.
[02:22:17.124 --> 02:22:18.124]  I'm pretty crazed, actually.
[02:22:18.124 --> 02:22:19.425]  Feels pretty good.
[02:22:19.425 --> 02:22:20.325]  Are you crazed?
[02:22:20.325 --> 02:22:23.086]  I'm beginning to realize being crazed is the secret to life.
[02:22:23.086 --> 02:22:27.208]  You know, I don't think you're actually intelligent or awake or alive unless you're crazed.
[02:22:27.208 --> 02:22:30.589]  I've noticed people I really like who have high intelligences are crazed as well.
[02:22:30.589 --> 02:22:33.210]  Max, I think you would describe yourself as crazed, wouldn't you?
[02:22:35.259 --> 02:22:36.259]  Isn't that how it's sealed?
[02:22:36.259 --> 02:22:38.060]  Something about, you gotta be a little crazy?
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:40.021]  You gotta be a little crazy!
[02:22:40.021 --> 02:22:41.581]  You know, that seal song.
[02:22:41.581 --> 02:22:43.862]  You know, the TSA people are everywhere in the world, you know.
[02:22:43.862 --> 02:22:45.103]  It's not just the United States.
[02:22:45.103 --> 02:22:50.205]  You travel anywhere in the world now, you have the same kind of people at every border crossing, everywhere in the world.
[02:22:50.205 --> 02:22:50.865]  It's gone global.
[02:22:50.865 --> 02:22:53.326]  That's an American export.
[02:22:53.326 --> 02:22:54.486]  Well, it's the RAND Corporation.
[02:22:54.486 --> 02:22:57.107]  Yeah, it's a global government program.
[02:22:57.107 --> 02:22:58.268]  It's a cognitive agenda.
[02:22:58.268 --> 02:23:01.429]  Ryan, real fast question here before I perseverate and cut you off.
[02:23:02.432 --> 02:23:02.972]  Alright, cool.
[02:23:02.972 --> 02:23:03.673]  No, it's okay.
[02:23:03.673 --> 02:23:06.174]  I'm a 30-year-old college graduate.
[02:23:06.174 --> 02:23:20.042]  I'm struggling, server at a restaurant, and I'm hearing all this talk about investing in gold and silver, and it's looking very unpractical for someone in my situation to invest any money that I do have that I'm trying to live off of.
[02:23:20.502 --> 02:23:25.127]  I would invest in skills that people will need on top of your degree.
[02:23:25.127 --> 02:23:33.134]  I would go apprentice and work for places, you know, Zano Plumbers and people that own lawn companies that make more money than most of the yuppies that have college degrees.
[02:23:33.134 --> 02:23:34.636]  I'm not knocking your college degree.
[02:23:34.636 --> 02:23:37.799]  The point is it doesn't exist in the model that's coming.
[02:23:37.799 --> 02:23:39.540]  It's like a big joke for the globalists.
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:43.964]  Some degrees will add worth, but only if you're willing to put people in gas chambers, basically.
[02:23:44.925 --> 02:23:51.071]  Law enforcement type degrees and surveillance and spy degrees But uh, you know, that's a useful thing.
[02:23:51.071 --> 02:23:53.153]  I would invest in friends family.
[02:23:53.153 --> 02:23:59.999]  I would invest in being in shape I would invest in lead and make sure you have firearms Max Geiser quick comment for him
[02:24:00.933 --> 02:24:02.795]  Well, he's not really an investor at all.
[02:24:02.795 --> 02:24:08.181]  He's somebody who's working to stay going.
[02:24:08.181 --> 02:24:10.924]  But there's a political side to the silver campaign.
[02:24:10.924 --> 02:24:15.489]  If you just buy one ounce, and if 100 million people bought one ounce, we would bankrupt J.P.
[02:24:15.489 --> 02:24:16.130]  Morgan.
[02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:17.912]  See, there's a political side to it.
[02:24:17.912 --> 02:24:19.614]  It's a savings vehicle.
[02:24:19.994 --> 02:24:24.417]  If you're not a saver, because you're a 100% worker, you have no savings at all, it's not a question.
[02:24:24.417 --> 02:24:33.303]  But if you're part of the political movement to put JPMorgan out of business, then you might want to scrape together $35 to buy one ounce.
[02:24:33.303 --> 02:24:34.784]  Alright, thank you so much.
[02:24:34.784 --> 02:24:36.665]  I appreciate your call.
[02:24:36.665 --> 02:24:38.606]  Max Keiser, look forward to talking to you again soon.
[02:24:38.606 --> 02:24:40.067]  Thank you for the time.
[02:24:40.067 --> 02:24:42.769]  Oh, always a pleasure, and good luck with that baby burrito.
[02:24:43.783 --> 02:24:45.184]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:24:45.184 --> 02:24:47.004]  There goes Max Keiser.
[02:24:47.004 --> 02:24:56.328]  We've got Ted Anderson with us and we're going to talk about gold a little bit and go to a bunch of news and some video clips I want to play that are very, very important right now.
[02:24:56.328 --> 02:24:59.409]  But I tell you, helter skelter, I get to the top and I go to the bottom again.
[02:24:59.409 --> 02:25:03.631]  I'm not bummed out now, but it has been quite a manic show today.
[02:25:03.631 --> 02:25:08.813]  Gold rallies on large hedge fund buys right up to the highest level it's been in 2012.
[02:25:11.514 --> 02:25:12.095]  I don't know.
[02:25:31.955 --> 02:25:37.996]  So let's just get the deals out of the way first for people, and then I want to get into some more of your breakdown of what's been happening today.
[02:25:37.996 --> 02:25:46.638]  But I know you've got that two silver dollars at cost, and you get Obama Deception, American Dream, Exposing the Banking System, and the book Dishonest Money.
[02:25:46.638 --> 02:25:49.698]  Three free gifts to get two silver dollars at cost.
[02:25:49.698 --> 02:25:55.219]  Seventy-two dollars as a lost leader to get people in the door to realize what great deals you've got.
[02:25:55.219 --> 02:25:55.799]  People can call 800-686-2237.
[02:25:55.799 --> 02:25:55.839]  800-686-237.
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:03.141]  You know, I really believe in gold and silver.
[02:26:03.141 --> 02:26:05.662]  That's why I've been pushing silver since it was $5 an ounce.
[02:26:05.662 --> 02:26:10.343]  And gold, when it was $245, $260 an ounce, and now look at it.
[02:26:10.343 --> 02:26:11.884]  I didn't sell gold when it went to $2,000.
[02:26:11.884 --> 02:26:14.105]  I didn't sell it when it went down to $1,500.
[02:26:14.105 --> 02:26:16.785]  Because I know they're going the way of hyperinflation worldwide.
[02:26:16.785 --> 02:26:23.248]  And the place to buy your gold and silver, not just because they're sponsored, but because it's a Patriot and it's great prices, is Midas Resources, 800-686-237.
[02:26:23.248 --> 02:26:27.929]  Ask for the big list of Alex Jones radio specials.
[02:26:27.929 --> 02:26:29.370]  The lowest you'll find anywhere, at least.
[02:26:30.010 --> 02:26:31.893]  I've been able to find.
[02:26:31.893 --> 02:26:35.037]  You don't beat silver dollars at cost with three free gifts.
[02:26:35.037 --> 02:26:35.978]  These are good free gifts.
[02:26:35.978 --> 02:26:38.061]  It's not like it's a Guinsoo steak knife.
[02:26:38.061 --> 02:26:39.603]  Not knockin' Guinsoos are actually pretty good.
[02:26:39.603 --> 02:26:41.465]  The point is, you get what I'm saying.
[02:26:41.465 --> 02:26:41.646]  800-686-237.
[02:26:41.646 --> 02:26:46.853]  Ted, what are some of the other smokin' hot radio deals you got for people today?
[02:26:47.594 --> 02:26:49.095]  Well, you said the best one, the $72.
[02:26:49.095 --> 02:26:52.756]  I mean, the one kid that was just getting out of college with his degree.
[02:26:52.756 --> 02:26:55.297]  I mean, everybody can afford $72, but walking Liberty Halves are $17.07.
[02:26:55.297 --> 02:26:56.217]  We have Franks at $3.88.
[02:26:56.217 --> 02:26:56.997]  I mean, we have a lot of
[02:27:02.919 --> 02:27:03.239]  A lot of
[02:27:32.739 --> 02:27:33.640]  You better get on with it.
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:34.421]  You better get on with it.
[02:27:57.681 --> 02:27:58.461]  They are.
[02:27:58.461 --> 02:27:59.422]  There's no question about it.
[02:27:59.422 --> 02:28:01.082]  The central banks own a lot of gold.
[02:28:01.082 --> 02:28:05.824]  And around the world, not just the United States.
[02:28:05.824 --> 02:28:06.884]  But yeah, it's going on.
[02:28:06.884 --> 02:28:11.525]  We were talking earlier about how they manipulate the gold prices.
[02:28:11.525 --> 02:28:19.568]  GATTA reports that 80% of CNBC, of the paper gold that's being bought out there, is not even covered by anything at all.
[02:28:19.568 --> 02:28:22.028]  That means 20% of it's covered by gold.
[02:28:22.028 --> 02:28:26.790]  The swaps and so on and so forth, a lot of leverage, obviously.
[02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:31.332]  When that house of cards falls, it's going to be another big controversy and scandal.
[02:28:31.332 --> 02:28:37.795]  So, you know, it just adds up to, you know, you better have the gold and have it physically and get it into your possession.
[02:28:37.795 --> 02:28:41.536]  You know, if you've got IRAs, 401Ks, whatever, it's time to start moving in.
[02:28:41.536 --> 02:28:50.340]  When you have the central bank that's printing the money saying that, hey, savers are going to be penalized because you're in cash, you better start moving out.
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:54.502]  They're talking about printing money until they see the unemployment figures drop.
[02:28:54.602 --> 02:28:55.822]  No, I think you're an extremist.
[02:28:55.822 --> 02:28:57.203]  You said buy gold when it was $244 an ounce.
[02:28:57.203 --> 02:29:01.804]  I guess that was the low 12 years ago, and now it's, you know, almost $1,800.
[02:29:01.804 --> 02:29:02.865]  I think you're a bad person.
[02:29:02.865 --> 02:29:05.005]  You said buy silver when it was less than $5 an ounce.
[02:29:05.005 --> 02:29:07.326]  Now it's, you know, getting close up to $40 again.
[02:29:07.326 --> 02:29:09.127]  I mean, you're just a bad person.
[02:29:09.127 --> 02:29:10.527]  You're just a bad person, Ted.
[02:29:10.527 --> 02:29:12.648]  How dare you sell things you believe in?
[02:29:12.648 --> 02:29:14.428]  How dare you make people money?
[02:29:14.428 --> 02:29:15.869]  How dare you love freedom?
[02:29:15.869 --> 02:29:17.730]  How dare you support Ron Paul?
[02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:18.590]  How dare you?
[02:29:19.909 --> 02:29:24.512]  Well, you know, the funny thing is, is that I used to take a lot of heat for recommending gold and silver.
[02:29:24.512 --> 02:29:26.994]  But now, you know, the proof is in the pudding.
[02:29:26.994 --> 02:29:27.714]  Oh, you're evil.
[02:29:27.714 --> 02:29:28.935]  Being right is wrong.
[02:29:28.935 --> 02:29:29.595]  How horrible.
[02:29:29.595 --> 02:29:32.477]  I'm gonna go invest in some stock where I can be swindled.
[02:29:32.477 --> 02:29:36.440]  Folks, they can also take your IRAs and cash those out for you in gold and silver.
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:37.280]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:37.541]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:37.541 --> 02:29:42.764]  Give them a call.
[02:29:42.764 --> 02:29:44.205]  News Blitz, your call's coming up.
[02:29:44.205 --> 02:29:46.086]  Thank you, Extremist Ted.
[02:29:46.086 --> 02:29:47.107]  Horrible person.
[02:29:47.107 --> 02:29:47.827]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.827 --> 02:29:48.248]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.472 --> 02:29:54.420]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:57.085]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.075 --> 02:30:07.579]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:30:07.579 --> 02:30:10.181]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:30:10.181 --> 02:30:15.564]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:30:15.564 --> 02:30:20.547]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:30:20.547 --> 02:30:27.852]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:30:28.172 --> 02:30:32.034]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.

[02:30:33.836 --> 02:30:37.858]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.

[02:31:00.373 --> 02:31:02.316]  Aaron Fullin here.
[02:31:02.316 --> 02:31:13.928]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[02:31:13.928 --> 02:31:17.752]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[02:31:17.952 --> 02:31:20.734]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[02:31:20.734 --> 02:31:28.618]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[02:31:28.618 --> 02:31:36.123]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:31:36.403 --> 02:31:37.543]  But here's some good news.
[02:31:37.543 --> 02:31:43.745]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[02:31:43.745 --> 02:31:47.086]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[02:31:47.086 --> 02:31:49.926]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[02:31:49.926 --> 02:31:51.947]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[02:33:00.483 --> 02:33:06.826]  You know, freedom is wild.
[02:33:06.826 --> 02:33:08.346]  Freedom is scary.
[02:33:08.346 --> 02:33:10.807]  Freedom is dynamic.
[02:33:10.807 --> 02:33:12.988]  And it comes down to this.
[02:33:12.988 --> 02:33:14.529]  Crank that up!
[02:33:14.529 --> 02:33:14.749]  Yeah!
[02:33:17.188 --> 02:33:21.038]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:31.771]  You know why, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:33:31.771 --> 02:33:38.315]  Because I am awake, and I am alive, and I don't care what people think about me.
[02:33:38.315 --> 02:33:41.717]  It's incredibly liberating, but I understand why people choose slavery.
[02:33:41.717 --> 02:33:43.618]  I know why they choose trendiness.
[02:33:43.618 --> 02:33:44.979]  I know why they choose karma.
[02:33:44.979 --> 02:33:46.120]  People think about them.
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.441]  Because once you get into real freedom, it's wild.
[02:33:48.441 --> 02:33:52.684]  And I just don't know if some of you out there can handle it.
[02:33:52.684 --> 02:33:56.707]  I just don't know if you can really step into the shoes and be a real human.
[02:33:56.707 --> 02:33:58.248]  Because let me tell you, it's good.
[02:33:59.113 --> 02:34:03.194]  And it's powerful, and it's strong, and it's hard.
[02:34:03.194 --> 02:34:05.295]  It's hard to carry the burden of reality.
[02:34:05.295 --> 02:34:08.696]  Ooh, I love that part of the song right there.
[02:34:08.696 --> 02:34:09.937]  That is just awesome.
[02:34:09.937 --> 02:34:11.337]  Crank it up.
[02:34:11.337 --> 02:34:11.757]  Good stuff.
[02:34:27.501 --> 02:34:44.289]  Okay, uh, man, I know we got a bunch of phone calls sitting here, and they wanted to talk to Max Keiser, but Max had to, Max, Max had to go, uh, well, he was pretty excited about that TSA confection, wasn't he?
[02:34:44.289 --> 02:34:47.370]  Oh, man, I tell ya, I don't know what to do anymore.
[02:34:47.370 --> 02:34:50.572]  I wish this wasn't true.
[02:34:50.572 --> 02:34:51.632]  I wish I wasn't right.
[02:34:51.632 --> 02:34:53.373]  Believe me, people, but I'm right.
[02:34:53.373 --> 02:34:55.134]  I'm about as right as you're gonna find.
[02:34:55.899 --> 02:34:57.821]  Doesn't mean I have all the answers.
[02:34:57.821 --> 02:35:01.984]  Let's take a few calls before I get to these news reports and then some other news.
[02:35:01.984 --> 02:35:11.812]  Let's talk to Bob in Tennessee, listening on 1600 AM WMQM, one of our fabulous affiliates.
[02:35:11.812 --> 02:35:13.013]  You're on the air, Bob!
[02:35:13.013 --> 02:35:13.394]  Welcome!
[02:35:14.954 --> 02:35:23.218]  Yeah, my family and my friends would all say I'm crazed, so I would just say get crazed, InfoWars.com.
[02:35:23.218 --> 02:35:23.639]  That's right.
[02:35:23.639 --> 02:35:27.821]  I did have a question for Max Keiser, but I think I could probably ask you just as well.
[02:35:27.821 --> 02:35:31.083]  Okay.
[02:35:31.083 --> 02:35:39.587]  If, as he predicts, the landslide will hit us economically in April, would that
[02:35:41.104 --> 02:35:46.653]  Eliminate the threat of the police state if it hits us that soon.
[02:35:46.653 --> 02:35:49.357]  No, again, he never fully defines it.
[02:35:49.357 --> 02:35:50.759]  I mean, he calls a collapse.
[02:35:52.031 --> 02:36:00.214]  Basically something twice as bad as what happened in 08, you know, half the stock market down, and then the inflation starts.
[02:36:00.214 --> 02:36:07.636]  I mean, he calls the collapse the doorway entering into the cattywampus event.
[02:36:07.636 --> 02:36:12.038]  So, I mean, it's still a process because the globalists gobble things like a predator.
[02:36:12.038 --> 02:36:14.579]  A lion doesn't go out and eat all the gazelles at once.
[02:36:14.579 --> 02:36:16.419]  It grabs one and then grabs another.
[02:36:16.419 --> 02:36:17.540]  It's like crocodiles do that.
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:22.685]  So this is kind of serial killer psychology where they pick us off one at a time.
[02:36:22.685 --> 02:36:25.107]  I mean, that's how they operate.
[02:36:25.107 --> 02:36:31.834]  But, you know, at a certain point, even if it's incremental, at a certain point, you know, you're pretty darn deep into the tyranny.
[02:36:31.834 --> 02:36:33.495]  I mean, I don't know if Max is right.
[02:36:33.495 --> 02:36:37.640]  It's just that, you know, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, who's always said it'll be a gradual collapse.
[02:36:38.959 --> 02:36:40.580]  He's saying, yeah, things are accelerating.
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:45.521]  He said like three years ago, he said about three years would be when he'd start saying, look for a real huge collapse.
[02:36:45.521 --> 02:36:46.941]  And now we're starting to get close to that.
[02:36:46.941 --> 02:36:52.243]  I mean, everybody I talk to, but I research things myself.
[02:36:52.243 --> 02:36:53.503]  I don't just look at the economics.
[02:36:53.503 --> 02:37:02.866]  I look at the preparations, the police, the digging in, the conditioning, the preparations for terror attacks, which they'll stage to pose as saviors.
[02:37:02.866 --> 02:37:07.588]  I mean, I look at a constellation of other data that a lot of these economic guys don't.
[02:37:08.268 --> 02:37:12.331]  And I see what they're saying from another perspective, and it just doesn't look good.
[02:37:12.331 --> 02:37:16.394]  And it just makes me sick the globalists are doing this to run everything.
[02:37:16.394 --> 02:37:20.237]  I mean, they're already in control, but they really want to hurt people.
[02:37:20.237 --> 02:37:22.238]  They really want to bankrupt us.
[02:37:22.238 --> 02:37:26.181]  They really want to make us poor so they can totally tell us what to do.
[02:37:27.279 --> 02:37:41.154]  And they're going to tell the public, raise taxes, which they know actually brings in less receipts, write more tickets, more fines, more fees, which is meant to extinct economic activity that they don't control, because they're exempt from everything.
[02:37:41.154 --> 02:37:44.998]  The globalists, remember, are exempt from 99% of the garbage they put on us.
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:55.964]  So they freeze us and make us move in slow motion economically, and they're like The Flash running around the world five times in two seconds.
[02:37:55.964 --> 02:37:58.825]  I mean, literally, it's like, in fact, we're not even moving.
[02:37:58.825 --> 02:38:05.267]  It's like we're frozen and they've got the whole world.
[02:38:05.267 --> 02:38:10.189]  To them, one minute is like a thousand years, and that's why they're able to get away with all this.
[02:38:13.054 --> 02:38:26.986]  I heard Paul Kurt Roberts last week in an interview on your show say that, describing the financial collapse, he said, you won't have to worry about a police state.
[02:38:26.986 --> 02:38:28.948]  And that's where my question comes from.
[02:38:28.948 --> 02:38:29.548]  I understand.
[02:38:29.548 --> 02:38:33.371]  Well, no, he says, yeah, and he's been somebody who's, well, you're right.
[02:38:33.371 --> 02:38:37.975]  I mean, it could be just absolute, total, beyond Argentina.
[02:38:37.975 --> 02:38:39.577]  And then the cops are going to
[02:38:41.334 --> 02:38:43.896]  And the bureaucrats and all of them are going to be fending for themselves.
[02:38:43.896 --> 02:38:47.218]  And boy, if that happens, Katie, bar the door.
[02:38:47.218 --> 02:39:01.269]  I mean, Homeland Security is running TV ads and print ads about zombie apocalypse using the archetype of the public without their electricity and power and gas and food as zombies.
[02:39:02.409 --> 02:39:03.710]  There's a reason.
[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:12.314]  Within 10 days, in major Pentagon studies, you can pull up, just type in government Pentagon studies on civilization collapse.
[02:39:12.314 --> 02:39:13.915]  There's a bunch of studies.
[02:39:13.915 --> 02:39:17.597]  But most studies show within 9 to 10 days, almost everyone,
[02:39:18.377 --> 02:39:24.081]  About 98% of people will kill you for everything you've got.
[02:39:24.081 --> 02:39:30.465]  Within 15 days, over 90%, it's about 91%, become cannibals.
[02:39:30.465 --> 02:39:32.546]  Within 15 days.
[02:39:32.546 --> 02:39:33.967]  What happens to the other 9%, 8%?
[02:39:33.967 --> 02:39:37.149]  They commit suicide, generally.
[02:39:37.149 --> 02:39:39.951]  Or die fighting the cannibals.
[02:39:39.951 --> 02:39:42.993]  If you want to know what this will look like, watch the movie The Road.
[02:39:44.804 --> 02:39:57.433]  If one of their antimatter bombs goes off in one of their bunkers, or if the power goes off and the reactors blow up, 407 of them worldwide, if any of that kind of stuff happens, go watch Viggo Mordensen's The Road.
[02:39:57.433 --> 02:39:59.714]  That is exactly what people act like.
[02:39:59.714 --> 02:40:06.759]  Except the book that was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the book on that actually has them roasting babies on spits.
[02:40:06.759 --> 02:40:09.581]  So, 90% become cannibals, 8-9% commit suicide.
[02:40:14.377 --> 02:40:18.019]  And that's what happens, so not a very nice situation.
[02:40:18.019 --> 02:40:23.762]  Yeah, that's why Homeland Security is branding the general public as cannibals, as zombies.
[02:40:23.762 --> 02:40:35.847]  Because the average yuppie down the street that's totally trend, total trender, that person will act like a zombie from a horror movie within 15 days of the type of road warrior collapse you're talking about.
[02:40:38.027 --> 02:40:44.094]  Our best bet is simply to plan for that scenario and let the rest of it fall where it will.
[02:40:44.094 --> 02:40:45.976]  Yeah, because government's so decadent.
[02:40:45.976 --> 02:40:48.879]  I mean, the Nazis were evil, but they were focused and professional.
[02:40:49.617 --> 02:40:55.379]  The elites we have and their minions are pretty cowardly at the end of the day because they never face armies.
[02:40:55.379 --> 02:40:57.060]  They mainly just pick on people all day.
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:58.981]  You know, here domestically.
[02:40:58.981 --> 02:41:04.963]  So they're going to try to organize going through the countryside, looting everybody for their goods to feed themselves.
[02:41:04.963 --> 02:41:11.766]  But that will burn out and stop pretty quick if it ever goes to that red level, which I don't think it will.
[02:41:11.766 --> 02:41:14.567]  But I mean, it will just be absolute
[02:41:15.629 --> 02:41:15.989]  They are.
[02:41:43.772 --> 02:41:52.361]  Well, I mean, all I know is, I hope all of you enjoy it, the service system, because my God, you have no idea what you're about to turn loose.
[02:41:52.361 --> 02:41:57.286]  99% of the minions of this that think they're powerful, that get off on being on the black wings of the New World Order...
[02:41:58.817 --> 02:42:02.639]  You know, they have no idea what they've signed on to.
[02:42:02.639 --> 02:42:04.480]  And they think it's all cute and funny.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.922]  You know, the TSA thinks, you know, TSA agents robbing a million bucks out of people, one guy.
[02:42:08.922 --> 02:42:11.404]  They think it's all cutesy and funny.
[02:42:11.404 --> 02:42:12.424]  They're gonna find out.
[02:42:12.424 --> 02:42:13.645]  I mean, they're gonna find out.
[02:42:14.833 --> 02:42:16.354]  Anyways, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:42:16.354 --> 02:42:18.075]  Let's go to Dan Bodondi's report here.
[02:42:18.075 --> 02:42:19.917]  This is a really good report.
[02:42:19.917 --> 02:42:28.123]  He and David Ortiz went down there to the end of the Fed last week and I heard this on the nightly news, seven o'clock every night, Infowarsnews.com.
[02:42:28.123 --> 02:42:30.445]  There's a 15-day free trial there on the site.
[02:42:31.085 --> 02:42:34.006]  I don't even care if you go sign up and then cancel it in 15 days.
[02:42:34.006 --> 02:42:34.586]  That's fine.
[02:42:34.586 --> 02:42:36.026]  One membership is $5.95 a month.
[02:42:36.026 --> 02:42:37.547]  It's really six memberships.
[02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:44.068]  We need to get a press release out on that explaining it because each username and passcode you create needs to be just for the site because then you can share it with friends and family.
[02:42:44.068 --> 02:42:53.731]  Six people can be logged in simultaneously on one so that's a dollar a month or less than a dollar a month per member at PrisonPlanet.tv and then you fund us trying to stop this collapse from happening.
[02:42:53.731 --> 02:42:55.371]  And I'm sorry we get a little punch drunk from
[02:42:55.851 --> 02:42:58.293]  Info war fatigue can go kind of crazy, but hey, so what?
[02:42:58.293 --> 02:43:03.738]  It's good to get outside the box and just flail around, let people know how serious things are.
[02:43:03.738 --> 02:43:08.302]  But I think we can avert all this, or at least back it down to a certain extent.
[02:43:08.302 --> 02:43:14.308]  But here's Dan Bodondi talking to the people protesting, and they're totally informed.
[02:43:14.308 --> 02:43:22.015]  And then he goes and talks to the general public, and none of them knew anything, except for two of the people heard him talking to someone else and heard him inform them.
[02:43:22.555 --> 02:43:30.757]  So, so, so, so actually no one we talked to on the street, outside of the in-the-Fed protesters, knew that a private bank runs the country.
[02:43:30.757 --> 02:43:31.718]  And this is your enemy.
[02:43:31.718 --> 02:43:33.978]  This is who's running the whole takeover.
[02:43:33.978 --> 02:43:35.319]  So we've got to identify them.
[02:43:35.319 --> 02:43:38.760]  I mean, at least the French knew the Nazis had occupied them.
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:41.141]  Or people in Romania knew the Soviets had occupied them.
[02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:43.441]  Or East Germans knew the Soviets had occupied them.
[02:43:43.441 --> 02:43:45.502]  I mean, here, people don't even know they've been occupied.
[02:43:45.502 --> 02:43:48.623]  So here's that report, and then more news in your calls coming up.
[02:43:48.623 --> 02:43:48.943]  Here it is.
[02:43:51.004 --> 02:43:56.726]  Hi, Dan Badondi in San Antonio, Texas, standing on a property we used to be called the Federal Reserve.
[02:43:56.726 --> 02:44:04.788]  We're live at a protest and what we're going to do today is we're going to ask the people in the protest what the government calls terrorists and conspiracy terrorists.
[02:44:04.788 --> 02:44:07.369]  We're going to question their knowledge on the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:07.369 --> 02:44:13.651]  Then later, we're going to go over to the Alamo and question the general public on the same questions about the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.362]  Hi, I want to ask you five questions on the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:17.362 --> 02:44:19.164]  One, what is the Federal Reserve?
[02:44:19.164 --> 02:44:28.532]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel that has a charter to issue America's money through debt to our Treasury Department.
[02:44:28.532 --> 02:44:30.233]  It's a government-created cartel.
[02:44:30.233 --> 02:44:33.916]  We got a bunch of bankers together so they can print paper and steal our wealth.
[02:44:33.916 --> 02:44:37.019]  The Federal Reserve is a private for-profit bank that was started up in 1913.
[02:44:39.346 --> 02:44:42.848]  The Federal Reserve is actually not federal at all.
[02:44:42.848 --> 02:44:53.733]  Its origins are as per the 1913 law which was put through Congress on miraculously a day when part of most of Congress, probably 80% of Congress, was absent.
[02:44:53.733 --> 02:45:02.077]  And it was pushed through as legislation in order to guard or hedge against an economic depression of the type that we had prior.
[02:45:02.737 --> 02:45:14.848]  The Federal Reserve is a private institution that prints money, usually not for interests of Americans, more for foreign banks and I'd like to say the establishment's agenda.
[02:45:14.848 --> 02:45:22.215]  What they do is, like I said, they print money that's backed by nothing, they raise inflation rates, they raise the cost of living for the middle class.
[02:45:22.215 --> 02:45:24.057]  A private international banking cartel?
[02:45:24.537 --> 02:45:31.260]  Basically, it's a private banking institution that was founded in 1913, and it basically controls our money.
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:34.462]  And you just answered all three of the first three questions.
[02:45:34.462 --> 02:45:37.683]  And what year was the Federal Reserve established in the United States?
[02:45:37.683 --> 02:45:40.184]  The Federal Reserve Charter was established on December 23, 1913.
[02:45:42.585 --> 02:45:44.807]  1913, one of those 13 unlucky number years.
[02:45:44.807 --> 02:45:44.827]  1913.
[02:45:44.827 --> 02:45:46.989]  1913, I believe.
[02:45:46.989 --> 02:45:49.511]  It was established in 1913.
[02:45:49.511 --> 02:45:52.714]  Is the Federal Reserve a federal or private company?
[02:45:52.714 --> 02:45:54.716]  It's a private banking cartel.
[02:45:54.716 --> 02:45:55.716]  Definitely private.
[02:45:55.716 --> 02:45:57.758]  It's a private company, a bunch of bankers.
[02:45:57.758 --> 02:45:58.579]  Private corporation.
[02:45:59.141 --> 02:46:00.062]  Very much private.
[02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:05.045]  Contrary to most people's belief, just because it says federal, it is not a federal entity at all.
[02:46:05.045 --> 02:46:06.366]  It's a private corporation.
[02:46:06.366 --> 02:46:08.387]  And recently, the Fed announced QE3.
[02:46:08.387 --> 02:46:09.528]  What is QE3?
[02:46:09.528 --> 02:46:23.718]  QE3 is, well, it's basically money debasement through the institution of $40 billion a month through the toxic mortgage assets department that's going to be pumped into the American economy.
[02:46:24.718 --> 02:46:28.679]  It's where they're going to print a bunch more bucks that are going to devalue the money you got out here already.
[02:46:28.679 --> 02:46:35.140]  The implementation of more fiat money into the money system that will devalue the dollar as it stands.
[02:46:35.140 --> 02:46:45.342]  As Bernanke has announced, QE3 is actually going to be producing or pumping $40 billion worth of money into the economy every month.
[02:46:45.342 --> 02:46:46.463]  I guess quantitative easing.
[02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:51.884]  I believe they're going to start the process of printing even more money, more money than they've already been printing.
[02:46:51.884 --> 02:46:52.864]  And like I said, it's going to
[02:46:53.604 --> 02:46:55.026]  Only serve to raise inflation rates.
[02:46:55.026 --> 02:47:02.272]  It's basically their failed strategy to try and ease the economic downturn that we're seeing and the devaluation of the dollar.
[02:47:02.272 --> 02:47:10.260]  And final question, could you name two of the three major banking families that were at Jekyll Island that helped push the Federal Reserve?
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:12.262]  Of course there's the Morgans and the Rothschilds.
[02:47:12.833 --> 02:47:17.756]  Let's see, there's the Schiff family, the Warburgs, the Rockefellers.
[02:47:17.756 --> 02:47:26.340]  Well, there would be the Rothschild family banking, and that would be, let's see, JP Morgan, I believe, is also owned by the Queen.
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:28.702]  The Rockefellers, I believe what...
[02:47:31.195 --> 02:47:33.016]  I'm thinking the Rothschilds?
[02:47:33.016 --> 02:47:36.157]  Yeah, the Red Skulls, which go by the Rothschild family.
[02:47:36.157 --> 02:47:36.997]  JP Morgan.
[02:47:36.997 --> 02:47:39.798]  The Rothschilds, definitely.
[02:47:39.798 --> 02:47:42.498]  Morgan, as in Chase Morgan Bank.
[02:47:42.498 --> 02:47:44.819]  We just moved over to the Alamo.
[02:47:44.819 --> 02:47:51.481]  Now we're going to ask the general public the same questions we asked the people at the end of the Fed rally.
[02:47:51.481 --> 02:47:54.462]  Hi, can you tell me what the Federal Reserve is?
[02:47:54.462 --> 02:47:55.942]  No, I cannot.
[02:47:55.942 --> 02:47:58.963]  No, I have no idea.
[02:47:58.963 --> 02:47:59.543]  Not at the moment.
[02:48:00.393 --> 02:48:02.535]  Yes, the central banks.
[02:48:02.535 --> 02:48:05.357]  It's the banks of the government.
[02:48:05.357 --> 02:48:07.839]  It's a bank.
[02:48:07.839 --> 02:48:08.860]  Bank of Unity.
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:10.201]  Do you know what year they were established?
[02:48:10.201 --> 02:48:10.221]  1920.
[02:48:10.221 --> 02:48:11.942]  1800s?
[02:48:11.942 --> 02:48:12.523]  Around 1840.
[02:48:12.523 --> 02:48:14.505]  Well, now I do, 1913.
[02:48:14.505 --> 02:48:17.127]  No, I do not.
[02:48:17.127 --> 02:48:18.188]  I think, was it 1913 or 1915?
[02:48:18.188 --> 02:48:18.488]  1913, yep.
[02:48:28.999 --> 02:48:32.802]  Is the Federal Reserve private or federal?
[02:48:32.802 --> 02:48:33.583]  Federal.
[02:48:33.583 --> 02:48:34.543]  Private.
[02:48:34.543 --> 02:48:35.504]  Federal.
[02:48:35.504 --> 02:48:39.087]  It's a federal, but it's private banks.
[02:48:39.087 --> 02:48:43.390]  You would figure it's federal, but more likely it's private.
[02:48:43.390 --> 02:48:44.751]  Federal.
[02:48:44.751 --> 02:48:47.213]  Recently, the federal government announced QE3.
[02:48:47.213 --> 02:48:48.314]  It's all over the news.
[02:48:48.314 --> 02:48:49.815]  QE3, do you know what that is?
[02:48:49.815 --> 02:48:50.275]  I do not.
[02:48:50.275 --> 02:48:52.757]  A letter bull****.
[02:48:52.757 --> 02:48:53.738]  No.
[02:48:53.738 --> 02:48:54.659]  No, actually, I don't.
[02:48:55.909 --> 02:48:57.130]  I have no idea.
[02:48:57.130 --> 02:48:58.070]  I haven't heard of KB3 yet.
[02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:59.671]  I couldn't answer that one.
[02:48:59.671 --> 02:49:01.531]  Like I said, I couldn't give you any of them.
[02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:03.272]  I don't know, actually.
[02:49:03.272 --> 02:49:04.173]  I do not know.
[02:49:04.173 --> 02:49:05.173]  Lynch, Merrill, and... I don't know.
[02:49:05.173 --> 02:49:05.273]  IBC?
[02:49:25.393 --> 02:49:26.714]  No, sir, I cannot.
[02:49:26.714 --> 02:49:29.075]  We're the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.
[02:49:29.075 --> 02:49:37.999]  And as you can see, folks, the terrorist protesters we interviewed are smarter than the general public when it comes to the Federal Reserve.
[02:49:37.999 --> 02:49:40.980]  And this is Dan Bodondi reporting for the N4's Nightly News.
[02:49:42.557 --> 02:49:48.959]  Well, good job, Dan, and you can watch that video up at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:49:48.959 --> 02:49:59.323]  They're also trying to shut down one of our big YouTube channels with 240 million views, so I'm having all the crew launch their own sites that people need to subscribe to, other accounts.
[02:49:59.323 --> 02:50:08.166]  We're going to start uploading stuff in HD starting towards the end of the week, so be sure and get over to the YouTube Alex Jones channel and do that.
[02:50:09.387 --> 02:50:16.457]  Look, the reason the globalists have been able to take over is a foreign army attacking is sexy.
[02:50:16.457 --> 02:50:16.917]  Politically.
[02:50:16.917 --> 02:50:20.342]  You know, it's uniforms, it's bombers, it's the enemy, there it is.
[02:50:20.342 --> 02:50:22.225]  But bankers coming in, fraudsters.
[02:50:24.459 --> 02:50:25.760]  That's how we've been conquered.
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:28.483]  And over a hundred years ago, the U.S.
[02:50:28.483 --> 02:50:33.206]  Banking Association, there was a book written on it, I've seen the documents, said, people are too smart.
[02:50:33.206 --> 02:50:36.649]  It's like in 1898, they said, we've got to buy up all the newspapers and dumb people down.
[02:50:36.649 --> 02:50:48.018]  Because see, back then, it was cool to know how to read, and it was cool to be informed, and all people did was obsess over politics and get real angry, and the official sport was battling the government.
[02:50:48.018 --> 02:50:49.259]  That's why Americans were different.
[02:50:49.259 --> 02:50:50.260]  Everybody marveled at us.
[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:56.267]  So they took us over, dumbed us down, put fluoride in our water, and we are now the stupidest people in the world.
[02:50:56.267 --> 02:50:58.109]  I love America, but we gotta admit it.
[02:50:58.109 --> 02:50:59.291]  We've been chemically attacked.
[02:50:59.291 --> 02:51:03.516]  I mean, we're brain-damaged.
[02:51:03.516 --> 02:51:05.458]  25 years is reason to celebrate!

[02:52:01.581 --> 02:52:02.582]  Hi there.
[02:52:02.582 --> 02:52:04.103]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:04.103 --> 02:52:07.925]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:07.925 --> 02:52:17.071]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:52:17.071 --> 02:52:23.796]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:23.796 --> 02:52:25.977]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:25.977 --> 02:52:31.061]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:52:31.781 --> 02:52:39.725]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:39.725 --> 02:52:45.308]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.

[02:52:57.534 --> 02:52:58.654]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:53:00.795 --> 02:53:04.677]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:04.677 --> 02:53:05.697]  That bears repeating.
[02:53:05.697 --> 02:53:09.579]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:09.579 --> 02:53:14.141]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.

[02:53:43.265 --> 02:53:47.169]  Spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[02:53:47.169 --> 02:53:48.711]  Terragonics dot com.
[02:53:48.711 --> 02:53:49.552]  Or call toll free 866-369-3678.
[02:53:49.552 --> 02:53:50.013]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:53:50.013 --> 02:53:51.094]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:54:25.584 --> 02:54:42.820]  Hey, we're going to get Gary Johnson on the show later this week and we're going to have a debate sometime during the week about, hey, do you, do you go and vote for Gary Johnson or ride in Ron Paul and then Barack Obama gets in?
[02:54:44.434 --> 02:54:56.336]  Because you could say you're protesting the left-right paradigm and that you're protesting the two-party system, the one-party monopoly, but actually you're just in the two-party system going to put Barack Obama in.
[02:54:57.725 --> 02:55:02.548]  I'm not saying that that's necessarily the end of the world, because maybe things will even accelerate more.
[02:55:02.548 --> 02:55:07.152]  I mean, do you think people are going to put up with Obama continuing another four years?
[02:55:07.152 --> 02:55:09.373]  Because Mitt Romney is going to try the same stuff.
[02:55:09.373 --> 02:55:13.236]  It's just that he'll have some street cred because he's new for a while.
[02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:14.477]  It'll take time to expose him.
[02:55:15.653 --> 02:55:18.056]  The question is, do you want Obama or do you want Romney?
[02:55:18.056 --> 02:55:19.597]  And it does become pick your poison.
[02:55:19.597 --> 02:55:21.419]  We're going to be talking about that later in the week.
[02:55:21.419 --> 02:55:28.907]  Here's some excerpts of like a 30-minute in-studio interview that David Ortiz, one of our great reporters, did on the InfoWars Nightly News in studio last week.
[02:55:28.907 --> 02:55:32.871]  I thought I'd play a few of these comments that Johnson said that I think are well newsmaking.
[02:55:32.871 --> 02:55:33.212]  Here they are.
[02:55:34.406 --> 02:55:37.227]  Is this a bill that the American public should be concerned about?
[02:55:37.227 --> 02:55:39.168]  This and the Patriot Act?
[02:55:39.168 --> 02:55:43.251]  The constant furthering erosion of our civil liberties?
[02:55:43.251 --> 02:55:46.152]  And this is happening in a very insidious way?
[02:55:46.152 --> 02:55:48.553]  The National Defense Authorization Act?
[02:55:48.553 --> 02:55:57.398]  Look, we fought wars over the government not being able to arrest you or I and hold us, detain us, without being charged.
[02:55:57.398 --> 02:56:00.820]  I think this is fundamental to the United States Constitution.
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:03.301]  I think it's fundamental to why we have fought wars.
[02:56:04.588 --> 02:56:06.893]  Tell us about the lawsuit and why you decided to file it.
[02:56:07.552 --> 02:56:10.354]  Well, we will be filing a number of lawsuits, actually.
[02:56:10.354 --> 02:56:16.937]  We filed the first of what are going to be three, but the first one was on antitrust grounds.
[02:56:16.937 --> 02:56:22.981]  Who are they and why are they able to restrict who doesn't or does get into the debates?
[02:56:22.981 --> 02:56:32.747]  They are a private organization and they're made up of Democrats and Republicans, so they have no vested interest whatsoever in seeing a third party on the debate stage.
[02:56:32.747 --> 02:56:34.808]  They were set up after Ross Perot, really,
[02:56:35.541 --> 02:56:39.722]  To prevent Ross Perot from ever being on stage again.
[02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:41.082]  How would you handle the Iranian crisis?
[02:56:41.082 --> 02:56:42.923]  Well, I would not bomb Iran.
[02:56:42.923 --> 02:56:46.564]  I don't think there is a military threat from Iran.
[02:56:46.564 --> 02:56:58.106]  And if we bomb Iran, in my opinion, we're going to find ourselves with another 100 million enemies to this country that, but for that bombing, would not otherwise occur.
[02:56:58.106 --> 02:57:03.768]  Let's not forget that after 9-11, the largest demonstration in the world in support of the United States was in Iran.
[02:57:04.908 --> 02:57:13.530]  And a million demonstrators show up in support of the United States, and we're going to bomb the citizens of Iran?
[02:57:13.530 --> 02:57:17.111]  Look, our beef is with Ahmadinejad, but it shouldn't involve bombing.
[02:57:17.111 --> 02:57:22.712]  If I were President of the United States right now, I would urge Israel to not be bombing Iran.
[02:57:22.712 --> 02:57:30.834]  If we don't want them to get a nuclear weapon, let's consider the notion of free trade as opposed to embargo.
[02:57:31.814 --> 02:57:35.255]  I would sign legislation abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[02:57:35.255 --> 02:57:36.716]  I think it's an inside game.
[02:57:36.716 --> 02:57:41.097]  The Federal Reserve takes money from Treasury.
[02:57:41.097 --> 02:57:43.278]  They loan it to the banks.
[02:57:43.278 --> 02:57:44.718]  They take money from the Treasury.
[02:57:44.718 --> 02:57:46.039]  Treasury prints the money.
[02:57:46.039 --> 02:57:49.900]  Federal Reserve gives it to the banks at 0% interest.
[02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:55.322]  Banks don't loan that money out to you or I. They buy up Treasuries in a closed loop.
[02:57:55.322 --> 02:57:55.662]  Look at it.
[02:57:55.662 --> 02:57:56.442]  This is Bernie Madoff.
[02:57:56.742 --> 02:58:02.806]  I mean, the full interview is up at Infowars.com, but I've got to say, I agree with that, everything he said.
[02:58:02.806 --> 02:58:08.710]  The issue is, okay, well, we don't want a Ross Perot, because that got Bill Clinton in, but really, it would have been George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:58:09.980 --> 02:58:11.960]  You see?
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:15.181]  And so, why can't we ever have more parties in there?
[02:58:15.181 --> 02:58:21.402]  But then, yes, it will probably, if he gets in the debates, he will probably deliver the White House to Barack Obama.
[02:58:21.402 --> 02:58:21.762]  You know what?
[02:58:21.762 --> 02:58:23.102]  I don't even know what to say about this.
[02:58:23.102 --> 02:58:25.523]  A few things make my head spin.
[02:58:25.523 --> 02:58:26.943]  I just know my gut is right.
[02:58:26.943 --> 02:58:28.403]  It's all staged at that level.
[02:58:28.403 --> 02:58:30.203]  And that's why Gary Johnson's going to be shut out.
[02:58:30.203 --> 02:58:31.684]  I don't think he'll be in the debates.
[02:58:31.684 --> 02:58:33.104]  But we'll find out more.
[02:58:33.104 --> 02:58:37.425]  By the way, there's new big breaking TSA news at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:58:41.172 --> 02:58:45.116]  You can also sign up to get the magazine free, a digital copy.

[02:58:51.258 --> 02:58:56.780]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:58:56.780 --> 02:58:59.181]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:58:59.181 --> 02:59:08.285]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:08.285 --> 02:59:11.727]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:59:11.727 --> 02:59:13.407]  There's no priming required.
[02:59:13.407 --> 02:59:15.688]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:59:15.688 --> 02:59:17.329]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce
[02:59:17.489 --> 02:59:18.230]  We're good to go.
[02:59:46.371 --> 02:59:48.592]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:59:48.592 --> 02:59:53.694]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.694 --> 02:59:55.754]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.754 --> 02:59:58.955]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:10.970 --> 03:00:17.995]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.995 --> 03:00:19.877]  Alright, we're in overdrive right now.
[03:00:19.877 --> 03:00:24.861]  Here's some of the breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:00:24.861 --> 03:00:26.782]  One is extremely satirical.
[03:00:26.782 --> 03:00:30.405]  Letter to Monsanto, thank you for making the world a better place.
[03:00:31.704 --> 03:00:33.926]  I may cover that on the nightly news tonight.
[03:00:33.926 --> 03:00:38.208]  Supreme Court refuses to hear lawsuit against TSA body scanners.
[03:00:38.208 --> 03:00:43.252]  Went all the way up there and they've proven that it's radiating people, but it's part of the total takeovers.
[03:00:43.252 --> 03:00:44.373]  The globalists are protecting it.
[03:00:44.373 --> 03:00:46.974]  It's part of our conditioning process.
[03:00:46.974 --> 03:00:50.197]  And I want to see comments in this article because I want to know what you think.
[03:00:50.737 --> 03:00:53.981]  I'm always interested in what you think in this article at Infowars.com.
[03:00:53.981 --> 03:00:58.025]  Gold's set to break 1800 barrier on endless QE inflation fears.
[03:00:58.025 --> 03:00:59.887]  Yeah, when do you think it'll go above 18 or 2000?
[03:00:59.887 --> 03:01:02.731]  What's your take on that?
[03:01:02.731 --> 03:01:04.473]  Let me see your comments in that article.
[03:01:05.674 --> 03:01:07.155]  I never got to this properly today.
[03:01:07.155 --> 03:01:08.955]  It's a very important article.
[03:01:08.955 --> 03:01:11.056]  The website is so heavily TSA today.
[03:01:11.056 --> 03:01:13.317]  I don't really tell my writers what to write about.
[03:01:13.317 --> 03:01:18.800]  Sometimes I recommend stuff or I write articles with them, but just all pretty much like 80% TSA in the featured news.
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:25.463]  TSA rescinds approval to film in response to an opt-out campaign, even though they have no authority to tell you you can't film.
[03:01:25.463 --> 03:01:27.664]  We have the proof there in that article.
[03:01:27.664 --> 03:01:30.905]  And a lot more up there at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[03:01:30.905 --> 03:01:32.286]  Let's jam in a couple calls.
[03:01:32.286 --> 03:01:34.267]  Mike in Oregon, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:01:34.267 --> 03:01:34.847]  What's your comment?
[03:01:36.135 --> 03:01:37.437]  Hey Alex, what's going on?
[03:01:37.437 --> 03:01:40.141]  I just want to say God bless you first of all.
[03:01:40.141 --> 03:01:43.827]  I had a question for Max Kaiser and then one for you.
[03:01:43.827 --> 03:01:45.931]  For Max, I was wondering, how do I
[03:01:48.024 --> 03:01:51.668]  How do I go about to get the information around here in Portland, Oregon?
[03:01:51.668 --> 03:01:53.650]  Because this is just Obama-phobia around here.
[03:01:53.650 --> 03:01:59.057]  Everyone's just, QE3's good, QE4's good, GMO's good, Obama's good.
[03:01:59.057 --> 03:02:02.701]  You know, what can I do around here to show people the facts?
[03:02:02.701 --> 03:02:04.102]  Should I show it to the mayor?
[03:02:04.102 --> 03:02:07.386]  Should I send it to Sam Adams, who said it was okay to put Florida in the water?
[03:02:07.386 --> 03:02:08.027]  What should I do?
[03:02:08.962 --> 03:02:11.886]  Yeah, well, you're in Nanny State Central there.
[03:02:11.886 --> 03:02:15.311]  I would just keep looking for people that want to be woken up.
[03:02:15.311 --> 03:02:17.473]  I'd wear an Infowars.com shirt out in public.
[03:02:17.473 --> 03:02:18.655]  You'll find like-minded people.
[03:02:18.655 --> 03:02:23.241]  And then get together, because the sheep only listen to authority and crowds.
[03:02:23.882 --> 03:02:24.642]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:02:24.642 --> 03:02:27.823]  Hey, I was wondering if you'd heard about Romney's plan to take away federal student loans and go privatized?
[03:02:54.405 --> 03:03:04.950]  I'm for real privatization, but not taking existing roads and putting a toll road on them, or just letting private interest do what government's already doing.
[03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:08.191]  Because that's just a private interest now becoming the government.
[03:03:08.191 --> 03:03:16.315]  And that's why the Bilderbergs and others are funding so much the libertarian movement now, because they want to co-opt it and turn it into something different.
[03:03:18.661 --> 03:03:22.203]  Also, I was wondering about, uh, you were talking about investing in lead and stuff.
[03:03:22.203 --> 03:03:25.265]  I was wondering if copper would be a worthy investment.
[03:03:25.265 --> 03:03:27.806]  Yeah, well, I mean, there is copper jacketing on lead.
[03:03:27.806 --> 03:03:31.208]  I just think, you know, the common nomenclature for bullets is lead.
[03:03:31.208 --> 03:03:36.211]  Uh, but yeah, no, I think, uh, copper's great, uh, full metal jacket.
[03:03:36.211 --> 03:03:46.517]  I mean, obviously, most rifle rounds, if not all of them, are jacketed in, uh, luscious lead, uh, is covered with the, uh, jacket, the full metal jacket.
[03:03:47.776 --> 03:03:52.202]  I'm talking about lead bullion because I know some of these bigger reloaders use lead bullion.
[03:03:52.202 --> 03:03:58.049]  I was wondering if maybe there's copper bullion you could invest in for lower costs for those of us that are kind of...
[03:03:59.227 --> 03:04:06.330]  Well, I mean, all the commodities are generally going to go up as the dollars evaluated, so yeah, I mean, I'm not going to tell people what I... I'll tell you what I would do.
[03:04:06.330 --> 03:04:07.730]  I'm not going to say what you should do.
[03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:08.711]  I mean, it's real simple.
[03:04:08.711 --> 03:04:10.071]  Do I take a sponsor?
[03:04:10.071 --> 03:04:13.252]  I'd buy it, try it, and then promote it.
[03:04:13.252 --> 03:04:14.473]  I mean, it's real simple.
[03:04:14.473 --> 03:04:15.653]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[03:04:15.653 --> 03:04:27.518]  It's like, if I like it, if I believe in it, every day I have, you know, different sponsor opportunities where it's some vitamin thing that claims it does this or that, and if I haven't tried it, if it hadn't worked, I'm not going to promote it.
[03:04:28.799 --> 03:04:31.081]  And that's the highest moral standard, by the way.
[03:04:31.081 --> 03:04:36.748]  Most talk radio and news, they will take any ad that comes in, as long as it's not anti-establishment.
[03:04:36.748 --> 03:04:37.689]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:39.212 --> 03:04:43.656]  I would invest in getting on your knees before God and asking God to heal this country and this world.
[03:04:43.656 --> 03:04:45.658]  I know a lot of you don't believe in God.
[03:04:45.658 --> 03:04:46.679]  Whatever.
[03:04:46.679 --> 03:04:49.061]  Focus on trying to make the world a better place.
[03:04:49.061 --> 03:04:50.803]  Take some time out to get focused.
[03:04:50.803 --> 03:04:53.785]  I mean, I do that all the time, and then I get on air and blow up.
[03:04:53.785 --> 03:04:54.686]  It's kind of an anomaly.
[03:04:54.686 --> 03:04:59.410]  I don't really blow up much outside of work, and then all I do is blow up here.
[03:04:59.410 --> 03:05:00.732]  But, hey, whatever.
