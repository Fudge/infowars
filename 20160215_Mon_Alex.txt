[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:35.920]  well there I was last night doing a live Facebook mentions on the mysterious death
[00:35.920 --> 00:40.280]  of Justice Scalia that we were instantly told just go to sleep don't pay attention
[00:40.280 --> 00:44.960]  to it move along even as they changed the story not once not twice not three
[00:44.960 --> 00:49.080]  times not four times not five times not six times not seven times not eight times
[00:49.080 --> 00:54.360]  more than 11 times I count they've totally changed the story absolutely key
[00:54.360 --> 01:00.640]  member of the judiciary the country is on a razor's edge the Constitution is
[01:00.640 --> 01:07.000]  is suspended by a thread right now we are being held over the edge of a cliff
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.280]  and he magically dies right on time with perfect timing and I come out Saturday
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.920]  and say what my listeners are screaming I mean every comment on M4's every
[01:18.920 --> 01:24.360]  comment on YouTube establishment comments on the Houston Chronicle I went
[01:24.360 --> 01:27.880]  and checked where this is suspicious there needs to be an autopsy immediately
[01:27.880 --> 01:32.880]  I can't believe they just came right out and said natural causes from an
[01:32.880 --> 01:36.000]  anonymous you know phone call we first heard and then the judge the next
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.720]  morning says we're not doing an autopsy on and on and on it has all the telltale
[01:41.720 --> 01:47.920]  science and then I saw this headline Scalia found dead with pillow over his
[01:47.920 --> 01:54.280]  head that's the article my San Antonio San Antonio Express News US Supreme Court
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.080]  Justice Anthony Scalia found dead in West Texas Ranch and has the owner of
[01:58.080 --> 02:03.680]  the ranch who goes in there a few hours you know after they thought Scalia would
[02:03.680 --> 02:07.880]  be at breakfast and they find him with a pillow over his face and people say
[02:07.880 --> 02:14.240]  why would they say that because whoever killed him ladies and gentlemen sent a
[02:14.240 --> 02:21.800]  message hey it's Luke Obrotsy's bulletproof vest with fish in it what's
[02:21.800 --> 02:27.080]  that mean it means he sleeps with the fishes the globalists know the child
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.040]  like public will be told you know he just died of a heart attack oh I mean he
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.600]  died of something else we don't know what he died of but it's natural that's the
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.760]  news story you know one of the changes but they leave the pillow on the face as
[02:39.760 --> 02:47.920]  a message to everyone at the Supreme Court in the Congress and everywhere else
[02:47.920 --> 02:54.280]  there are hundreds of articles yesterday and today attacking yours truly one of
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.960]  the worst is an entire Sydney morning Herald story the biggest paper in
[02:59.960 --> 03:06.640]  Australia that is an absolute shaken bank I've seen the same article probably
[03:06.640 --> 03:10.880]  5,000 times over the years I'm not joking because we're attacked several
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.400]  hundred times a day in major papers this is a formulaic shaken bank I can
[03:15.400 --> 03:19.000]  guarantee you talking points were given to this writer and they wrote it off a
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  template guaranteed and so later I'm gonna read the whole article on air and
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.880]  I'm going to just analyze as a professor how they do this it is incredible how
[03:32.880 --> 03:39.480]  they operate imagine they admit massive seismic shift globally not just for
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.200]  America was Scalia's death the final justice holding back who couldn't be
[03:44.200 --> 03:47.960]  blackmailed who couldn't be intimidated leading a revolt going on
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.080]  television saying they're coming after your guns going on television saying
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.040]  Obamacare's a total fraud and criminal leading an assault that the rest of the
[03:55.040 --> 04:00.400]  court is being intimidated and now he's deader than a doornail and the first
[04:00.400 --> 04:08.120]  announcement is doesn't appear to be any foul play natural causes from a little
[04:08.120 --> 04:16.160]  TV station in southwest Texas and then it's repeated by San Antonio TV station
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.280]  and no wonder mainstream media waited for two hours they didn't believe it
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.040]  journalist I saw him on Fox News and even seen in went well they didn't report
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.160]  it for a few hours because you don't normally come right out and say doesn't
[04:27.160 --> 04:31.320]  appear to be any foul play especially with somebody this powerful so we we
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.480]  thought it might be a mistake we discovered the judge in bed a pillow over
[04:36.480 --> 04:43.240]  his head his bed clothes were unwrinkled and man you read the statements out of
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.800]  these people boy if you've ever read a movie script you've read them all I
[04:47.800 --> 04:54.280]  mean this whole thing like we say here in Texas is as phony as a $3 bill and
[04:54.280 --> 04:58.360]  you know they like to kill people down here in Texas
[04:58.360 --> 05:02.840]  but Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia assassinated there's growing evidence
[05:02.840 --> 05:06.760]  suggesting that yes he was Scalia who once said he interpreted the bill arise
[05:06.760 --> 05:09.760]  no different than the founding fathers was found dead in his room while staying
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.040]  at a ranch owned by a Democratic donor in the remote Big Bend region of West
[05:13.040 --> 05:16.400]  Texas for one thing for civil county judge Cinderella Gabada first claimed
[05:16.400 --> 05:19.560]  that Scalia died of heart attack and then she later backed off that statement
[05:19.560 --> 05:23.040]  and claimed instead that he died of natural causes with no signs of foul
[05:23.040 --> 05:26.760]  play but she never saw the body in fact the Supreme Court Justice was found
[05:26.760 --> 05:31.040]  with a pillow over his head not only was there no autopsy performed on Scalia but
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.560]  his body was also rushed to a funeral home to be quickly embalmed a process
[05:34.560 --> 05:37.840]  which would destroy toxicology evidence indicating whether he had been poisoned
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.560]  the Arch Conservatives Scalia also posed many of Obama's policies on the legal
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.080]  immigration in gun control and Obama benefits from his death by now being
[05:45.080 --> 05:48.240]  able to appoint his own judge who will undoubtedly rubber-stamp the president's
[05:48.240 --> 05:52.360]  war on the Constitution. For more news visit info wars.com and YouTube channel

[06:09.520 --> 06:15.680]  and prepare a defense. Sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching
[06:15.680 --> 06:20.680]  filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the
[06:20.680 --> 06:26.280]  21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food
[06:26.280 --> 06:30.920]  and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our

[08:31.840 --> 08:39.400]  The enemy is moving there's no doubt about that. Expect more fireworks more deaths.
[08:39.400 --> 08:45.840]  Airplanes to get blown out of the sky. CIA came out yesterday and said ISIS
[08:45.840 --> 08:54.680]  attacks in America are inevitable. Mainstream headlines say World War 3
[08:54.680 --> 09:01.520]  could start by next month as Saudi Arabia prepares to send in more than 50,000
[09:01.520 --> 09:08.960]  troops to battle the Russians in Syria. Russian Prime Minister last week warned
[09:08.960 --> 09:15.480]  it could lead to a new world war. And of course in the midst of all that the key
[09:15.480 --> 09:21.800]  conservative justice leading a movement against the globalist takeover. The
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.800]  Supreme Court Justice who was going on mainstream television channels and
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.400]  warning the public that there's a takeover happening. Set to rule on carbon
[09:33.400 --> 09:40.200]  taxes open borders gun restrictions UN treaties dead. And I looked it up I've
[09:40.200 --> 09:43.840]  got the article Scalia almost always took his security detail of federal
[09:43.840 --> 09:50.360]  marshals with him but this time he decided not to on a quail hunting trip
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.240]  in South Texas and one of my favorite areas to go hiking and hunting and
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.440]  whitewater rafting. Folks know that I shoot a lot of videos when I'm down
[09:59.440 --> 10:04.520]  there go down there at least once a year. And the way this has been handled
[10:04.520 --> 10:11.920]  from start to finish from the minute it was announced until now is the most
[10:11.920 --> 10:15.360]  ridiculous
[10:18.880 --> 10:27.160]  attempt to lie to the public that I've seen in a long time. The way that he was
[10:27.160 --> 10:37.160]  dispatched the way they instantly crafted the entire polished narrative. Oh it
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.160]  was polished in its simplicity to try to open and shut things but then when
[10:41.160 --> 10:46.080]  people begin to look at reality all the different players surrounding it begin
[10:46.080 --> 10:48.920]  to admit well that's actually not true well I didn't say that well I didn't
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.000]  rule that well it wasn't our heart attack well we don't know how he died but
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.040]  we do know how he died but there'll be no autopsy but on and on and on and mainstream
[10:59.040 --> 11:05.360]  media for the first day and a half would not even question should there be an
[11:05.360 --> 11:12.200]  autopsy. It wasn't even discussed why there wasn't an autopsy much less hey
[11:12.200 --> 11:18.560]  should foul play be looked into. They would just use the words appears to be
[11:18.560 --> 11:33.480]  natural causes instantly the scripting is what you see here and knowing the
[11:33.480 --> 11:39.480]  globalist modus operandi their playbook they like to leave telltale signs for
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.800]  those that are actually informed of a vicious threat this is done for
[11:43.800 --> 11:53.480]  intimidation you don't just kill Scalia because he's that key conservative seat
[11:53.480 --> 12:01.040]  you can replace before Obama leaves office. You do it to intimidate all the
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.800]  other associate justices and the chief justice and all the other federal and
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.040]  state judges when a state judge dies in their bed they say we're gonna do an
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.400]  autopsy the coroner says and I mean that's just a default even the family
[12:16.400 --> 12:22.240]  tries to bucket they'll do it because of the cases those people sit over. Judges
[12:22.240 --> 12:28.440]  are one of the most targeted groups out there. Woody Harrelson's daddy was
[12:28.440 --> 12:35.840]  convicted of shooting a judge in Texas and San Antonio and that's just a pop
[12:35.840 --> 12:41.000]  culture example old Harrelson also got photographed of a Dealey Plaza oh speaking
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.560]  of Dealey Plaza frigging into all the hardcore news let me just play along with
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.440]  the mainstream media for just a moment and the hundreds of newspapers from
[12:50.440 --> 12:57.640]  New York City to Dallas, Texas to Sydney that are writing giant hit pieces
[12:57.640 --> 13:03.560]  against yours truly for just questioning was he killed but now watching their
[13:03.560 --> 13:06.240]  response and what they're doing and how they're behaving and how their story
[13:06.240 --> 13:09.640]  unraveled and how they tried to basically bury him before they even
[13:09.640 --> 13:17.120]  announced it I'd give it about a 95% chance he was killed.
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.680]  You know I'm surprised that they didn't just say that JFK we're gonna play this
[13:25.680 --> 13:33.160]  a Bruder film here in a moment in Dealey Plaza in 1963 died of natural causes. You
[13:33.160 --> 13:37.120]  know Benazar Budo when she came out and said Ben Lawton's been dead the CIA
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.480]  staging all this 9-11 was staged that was the Pakistani president she was
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.220]  running for office again they rocket propelled her, knaded her, shot up her
[13:45.220 --> 13:50.560]  car in front of international news cameras and in the U.S. news
[13:54.640 --> 14:02.920]  in the U.S. news they said she hit her head going over a bump in her car so you
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.240]  see if JFK was killed in 2016 they would just say he hit his head folks he
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.040]  died of natural causes and no autopsy is needed all right you heard that first at
[14:13.040 --> 14:21.200]  AP and CNN John F. Kennedy died of natural causes in Dallas or he hit his head
[14:21.200 --> 14:25.840]  you know you can even change the story I remember back during the last election
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.080]  the whole superdelegate fight not cover it they'd have news articles going Jones
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.960]  is insane he says the popular vote of people in primaries can be ignored
[14:33.960 --> 14:37.560]  everyone knows they don't steal delegates now today they go oh yeah we still
[14:37.560 --> 14:43.600]  delegates with superdelegates we appoint and that's just the way it is she I mean
[14:43.600 --> 14:49.160]  they've got NDAA on record with a federal judge that has basically written
[14:49.160 --> 14:55.080]  the NDAA who they want to replace Scalia to say kill U.S. citizens anywhere you
[14:55.080 --> 15:00.200]  want or domestically anytime torture them and and don't even tell the public
[15:00.200 --> 15:06.280]  don't even ever tell Congress remember three weeks ago and they're still trying
[15:06.280 --> 15:10.640]  to pass it the Republican leader of the Senate tried to give the presidency
[15:10.640 --> 15:17.680]  global martial law power to attack any person any place anything 360 at any time
[15:17.680 --> 15:26.320]  forever and then even a Democrat senator came out and on the floor of the Senate
[15:26.320 --> 15:29.880]  and admitted it was worldwide martial law they were trying to pass and there
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.280]  was zero mainstream news coverage when this when it's they don't even do hit
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.840]  pieces on things like that now they didn't even write articles saying Jones is
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.600]  insane lying about this being worldwide martial law it's so over the top they
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.440]  won't even try to lie about that now they're going to a new level of deafening
[15:48.440 --> 15:55.440]  silence so again let's show that to TV viewers viewer discretion advice for
[15:55.440 --> 15:58.320]  children out there well actually knows he just hit his head like Benazar Budo
[15:58.320 --> 16:07.280]  here is JFK in Dallas Texas and he hit his head folks he wasn't shot in the
[16:07.280 --> 16:11.040]  head I mean forget you know saying there weren't multiple gunmen let's just go
[16:11.040 --> 16:18.840]  further there was no guns at all all right and of course his brain was stolen
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.800]  I've also interviewed the funeral home director who became one of the biggest
[16:23.800 --> 16:28.400]  funeral home companies in Texas oh by the way he was coming to be interviewed
[16:28.400 --> 16:33.800]  in studio and a man in a black sedan rammed him off the road and then he
[16:33.800 --> 16:38.720]  basically was in bad health after that oh yeah he was coming to be on the show
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.560]  he'd been on the show before but he was there when the FBI came in put the ink
[16:43.560 --> 16:49.400]  on his hands took the hands and stuck them on the rifle they didn't just put
[16:49.400 --> 16:52.040]  his fingerprints on the rifle they wanted it in ink so they could hold it up
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.680]  to the idiot public and say look at those purple fingerprints yeah they're
[16:55.680 --> 17:01.960]  purple all right then after they buried Lee Harvey Oswald he came back after the
[17:01.960 --> 17:09.480]  weekend and the sarcophagus had been dug into removed and some other body
[17:09.480 --> 17:17.400]  stuck in there I mean this is the funeral home director I've interviewed
[17:17.400 --> 17:23.880]  him twice he came to one of my events told me who he was he was with a son
[17:23.880 --> 17:29.720]  how to get his son on I'm going from I'm teleprompter free there's so much
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.560]  data just it's just people ask how I know something's a killing it's the
[17:33.560 --> 17:36.760]  scripting it's the history it's how they do it and then they put a pillow on his
[17:36.760 --> 17:43.240]  face and then of course the people that are running the resort they don't want
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.480]  to murder to have happened where they're at they want to just believe what the
[17:47.480 --> 17:52.400]  law enforcement people he didn't have a security detail but a federal marshal
[17:52.400 --> 18:00.200]  later in the afternoon was able to get there some special federal marshal we
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.440]  don't know who's we can look into him we're not told names here cuz you know
[18:03.440 --> 18:10.120]  we don't want to be able to dig into anything and says oh it appears to not
[18:10.120 --> 18:17.200]  be foul play and then a bunch of local police in South West Texas I mean that's
[18:17.200 --> 18:22.640]  that's the most corrupt area Texas folks crooked is the dog's back leg or as
[18:22.640 --> 18:30.280]  Bill Clinton's proboscis and then they have a recession of 20 police cars in
[18:30.280 --> 18:42.320]  tube El Paso hours away and Obama is told two hours before it's even on local
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.800]  ABC news that he's dead so they could control it by releasing it through a
[18:46.800 --> 18:56.080]  little bitty TV station again two hours away the whole thing is exactly how you
[18:56.080 --> 19:06.800]  do it and it's designed it is designed for the most dumbed-down public to buy
[19:06.800 --> 19:11.480]  into it and just move along but the public is in revolt right now supporting
[19:11.480 --> 19:17.920]  Bernie Sanders supporting Donald Trump because they are seen as revolutionary
[19:17.920 --> 19:22.480]  whether they're real or not that's an expression of it there is almost no one
[19:22.480 --> 19:27.400]  online not on my site on major newspaper sites I went to him almost
[19:27.400 --> 19:31.880]  everyone is pointing out the timing how they announced it no autopsy how they're
[19:31.880 --> 19:35.160]  changing the story over and over and over and over again people say well
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.640]  stories change that's why you have autopsies it's why you have investigations
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.560]  especially of the key Supreme Court justice holding back the entire agenda
[19:42.560 --> 19:46.560]  and right on time and right when he didn't take a security detail just
[19:46.560 --> 19:55.080]  everything lining up perfectly didn't it that's why I'm interested this I'm gonna
[19:55.080 --> 20:02.840]  skip this break because this is of the highest magnitude ladies and gentlemen
[20:02.840 --> 20:12.120]  and what this signifies the fact that they dropped the hammer on Scalia let me
[20:12.120 --> 20:17.480]  put to you this way this not being murdered this not being foul play this
[20:17.480 --> 20:21.800]  not being staged when you know the facts the history how the pieces go
[20:21.800 --> 20:31.280]  together you look at the gestalt if he wasn't killed maybe he wasn't murdered
[20:31.280 --> 20:38.160]  then I'll also say maybe Hillary in Iowa did win six twin causes in a row in the
[20:38.160 --> 20:48.320]  six key precincts to win and get the extra delegate and beat Bernie Sanders
[20:48.320 --> 20:56.920]  maybe she did win six coin tosses in a row but you see she lost by 20 points in
[20:56.920 --> 21:02.080]  New Hampshire and still won oh that's okay too right because I'm a conspiracy theorist
[21:02.080 --> 21:07.840]  see gerbil said the Nazi propaganda minister and I've read his writings he
[21:07.840 --> 21:13.000]  said we don't want the lies to be complex we want them to be incredibly
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.200]  simple and it doesn't matter if they're easily disproven because the public
[21:17.200 --> 21:20.640]  isn't intellectual they want something lazy and dumb to not have to get
[21:20.640 --> 21:27.600]  involved or do anything they just don't want the responsibility to stand up
[21:27.600 --> 21:30.760]  while we're taking over their lives you ought to go read his writings I just
[21:30.760 --> 21:36.480]  paraphrase it it's it's nastier and you saw Gruber get up and say thank God
[21:36.480 --> 21:41.440]  Americans are so dumb we can rip them off in triple prices and the other
[21:41.440 --> 21:46.480]  professors seeing him as a god and that's what you send your kids to schools
[21:46.480 --> 21:52.000]  to learn how to lie now that's the new economy that's what we're based on it's
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.840]  like Buckley said last night in the Facebook mentioned con artists will
[21:54.840 --> 21:58.480]  say you can't cheat an honest man because they don't think like that and they
[21:58.480 --> 22:04.480]  instantly pick up on fraud but people that want to believe in fraud are lazy
[22:04.480 --> 22:09.000]  they're dumb they're intellectually stupid they want to be stupid and they
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.400]  want to just sit back and go whatever heart attack oh man oh yeah right folks
[22:14.400 --> 22:19.080]  it's the climate we're in it's the scripting it's the story unraveling
[22:19.080 --> 22:24.680]  and then it's meant to unravel that's meant Congress knows it's spied on
[22:24.680 --> 22:28.080]  remember I told you 20 years ago about an essay spying and exactly how it was
[22:28.080 --> 22:31.640]  being done and I was meant to predict future trends and blackmail people and
[22:31.640 --> 22:35.280]  how they did it and how the hubs were put in and how the it was wired into the
[22:35.280 --> 22:41.120]  phone companies I was interviewing Wayne Madsen 18 years ago he's a super
[22:41.120 --> 22:45.080]  famous NSA whistleblower just back then they would ignore it I've interviewed
[22:45.080 --> 22:49.680]  James Bamford the big whistleblower former main producer of Nightline I
[22:49.680 --> 22:57.440]  have interviewed the type of people like the AT&T executive six years ago that
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.600]  went public and said there's whole rooms and floors they run we build them
[23:02.600 --> 23:07.160]  billions a year for the bandwidth and they run everything through these hubs
[23:07.160 --> 23:11.640]  they build hubs folks in many cases where there'll be a whole building right
[23:11.640 --> 23:16.880]  next to another telecommunications building because they have to copy it
[23:16.880 --> 23:20.000]  all they have to run it through that's why they're getting rid of just all that
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.920]  now I'm just going you know what yeah we are taking it all and man and we're not
[23:23.920 --> 23:30.160]  going to pay you companies for the data anymore why do they even need to pay the
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.280]  companies anymore they just rule everything exactly what I told you
[23:34.280 --> 23:39.320]  exactly what I told you exactly what I told you is what they're doing because
[23:39.320 --> 23:43.520]  folks and no one else would talk about this so people heard me with NSA
[23:43.520 --> 23:48.640]  whistleblowers on and I had no idea how much danger I was in they had the army
[23:48.640 --> 23:56.440]  following me around that's been in the newspaper Bill Clinton had the army had
[23:56.440 --> 24:03.560]  Delta Force following me around you think this is a game folks I have I'd be at
[24:03.560 --> 24:08.640]  the rodeo doing announcing doing local radio and an old God walk up when I
[24:08.640 --> 24:11.320]  would be over there getting a nice tea and a hot dog during a break if you
[24:11.320 --> 24:15.200]  now it's really appreciate you here's an envelope and it'd be like specs to you
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.040]  know the microphones in the in the in the cable boxes and the plans for the
[24:20.040 --> 24:27.840]  video cameras in the in them and how the hubs were in time warner to the NSA and
[24:27.840 --> 24:32.680]  I'd tell my dad about it he'd say son no one's gonna believe me anyway throw that
[24:32.680 --> 24:37.680]  away in a dumpster right now and then I'd be out in the parking lot a year
[24:37.680 --> 24:41.440]  later and there'd be a guy go hey Alex I gave that a year ago why do you think
[24:41.440 --> 24:47.520]  of that I'd be like listen I don't I don't know how to vet all this well
[24:47.520 --> 24:50.800]  listen I had to take a cab here and be dropped off a half mile away to walk
[24:50.800 --> 24:53.720]  here because of the license plate reading cameras and blah blah I mean I
[24:53.720 --> 25:00.000]  have lived an ex files episode folks but but minus the the the zombie goblins
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.520]  and the Chubacabras and I get to sit here and look at over a hundred
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.680]  newspapers today type in Alex Jones he's a cook he's a nut oh he says they
[25:09.680 --> 25:13.160]  killed Scalia and then they go in the articles it's all formulaic and they
[25:13.160 --> 25:17.640]  say he also believes in space aliens and he also believes that martial law was
[25:17.640 --> 25:21.920]  coming with Jade Helm and he also and just lie after lie after lie after lie
[25:21.920 --> 25:28.000]  that I never said in a shaken bank operation to sit there and convince the
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.680]  public none of this is happening and then it goes further then they add a
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.320]  bunch of admitted stuff that's going on that's public after they talk about the
[25:36.320 --> 25:42.640]  space alien stuff to then discredit it all and if you read these articles you
[25:42.640 --> 25:45.640]  will learn how they operate
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.680]  because after they talk about you know space aliens and all the rest of it they
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.960]  say it's not uncommon to hear the Obama administration is planning to allow the
[25:57.960 --> 26:02.800]  United Nations to take over the nation using a framework was in 21 but the
[26:02.800 --> 26:05.400]  federal government is stockpiling ammunition for these people that Hillary
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.000]  Clinton ordered available forces to stand down the survivors are on record
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.680]  that they got the order from the State Department to stand down I mean it's
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.520]  just see oh that's a conspiracy all these Navy SEALs and people are lying they
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.080]  better not get on a helicopter like the ones on the fake bin Laden raid because
[26:21.080 --> 26:23.960]  they'll be gotten rid of these people are risking their lives are they
[26:23.960 --> 26:28.340]  conspiracy theorists to rather than rescue besieged American personnel in
[26:28.340 --> 26:33.600]  Benghazi oh imagine she why would she not want to rescue them because they
[26:33.600 --> 26:36.800]  were getting rid of them because they knew about the Stinger missile transfer
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.960]  and then I told you before they start using Stinger missiles to shoot down
[26:40.960 --> 26:44.720]  Western Airlines you'll see the cover stories that they've built their own
[26:44.720 --> 26:50.160]  Stinger missiles those articles were now rolled out a month ago that magically
[26:50.160 --> 26:56.560]  ISIS and Al Qaeda made their own Stinger missiles and I knew when I saw the
[26:56.560 --> 26:59.760]  headline they would later admit in the article that they were actually US
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.280]  Stinger missiles given to them and that they had just repaired them I just know
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.280]  their battle plans how they operated so formulaic and then I read the article and
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.240]  they they were talking about how they built Stinger missiles and you built a
[27:12.240 --> 27:15.120]  nuclear reactor out in the desert to you know with an Easter Bunny and Santa
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.800]  Claus and then it gets down to oh they're actually Stinger missiles we
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.020]  don't know where they got them but they fixed the battery and I told you get
[27:23.020 --> 27:27.920]  ready for the cover stories and then now the CIA director comes out and says get
[27:27.920 --> 27:31.840]  ready for ISIS attacks they're gonna attack all over the US and we're gonna
[27:31.840 --> 27:35.360]  take your rides away and yeah they're probably gonna shoot some airlines down
[27:35.360 --> 27:38.600]  how many hundreds of times that I say after Benghazi they'll transfer the
[27:38.600 --> 27:41.960]  weapons they'll go to Syria they'll be led into Europe they'll start shooting
[27:41.960 --> 27:45.480]  down airliners and then they'll bring in martial law civil emergency on the back
[27:45.480 --> 27:51.240]  of it exactly what I'm telling you and told you is now happening I mean actually
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.680]  I don't even know how I'm this smart I mean let's just be honest I'm not that
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.480]  smart the enemy is operating like we're complete idiots and I told you get ready
[28:00.480 --> 28:04.480]  they're gonna start saying a few years ago that Assad is the reason ISIS and
[28:04.480 --> 28:07.680]  al Qaeda are in Syria and we must take out Assad to stop them or they're gonna
[28:07.680 --> 28:13.640]  attack us in America and I was watching Fox this morning and they had you know
[28:13.640 --> 28:18.120]  the generals the retired generals on the payroll going we got to get tough and
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.680]  invade and take out Assad right now that'll work with Saudi Arabia to do it
[28:21.680 --> 28:27.480]  as they've got missiles and they've got all these weapons they're gonna hit us
[28:27.480 --> 28:30.680]  in America like the CIA director said and we've allowed them to have a safe
[28:30.680 --> 28:38.360]  haven in Syria we got to take them out you put them in there you gave them the
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.560]  safe haven you gave them the weapons and then you turn around and blame Assad and
[28:42.560 --> 28:46.840]  the Russians battling it for their lives and you prepare to bring in massive
[28:46.840 --> 28:53.600]  ground forces for a full-out war with Russia in Syria you look at Syria it's
[28:53.600 --> 28:58.680]  right under the border of Russia Ukraine is fighting NATO proxy troops right now
[28:58.680 --> 29:08.000]  on its border in Ukraine of course they killed Scalia there are times in history
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  when the evil moves and evil is moving and is accelerating and went from a
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.200]  hundred miles an hour to a thousand miles an hour and now it's accelerating
[29:17.200 --> 29:23.960]  to just white speed folks they got a word for it it's called incoming and get
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.800]  ready for all Hades to break loose and if the public buys this and if there
[29:27.800 --> 29:32.080]  isn't an investigation they'll take it as a signal to start doing more but
[29:32.080 --> 29:36.720]  happening be found with that pillow over his face is a message to everyone now
[29:36.720 --> 29:40.000]  it means people that found him I don't think we're involved because if they
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.120]  were involved they would just remove the pillow unless again it was meant to be
[29:44.120 --> 29:47.240]  there so they'd find it and report it and it's a message to everyone you do
[29:47.240 --> 29:51.520]  what we say we're gonna kill you we're on the March the Empire's on the run and
[29:51.520 --> 29:55.480]  we'll be a horse Alex Jones and the GCN will show a bloody horsehead in the bed
[29:55.480 --> 30:00.720]  with the body but we don't know what it means today is Monday February 15th and
[30:00.720 --> 30:04.000]  here's the latest in international news the Syrian government army is advancing
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.680]  to Raqqa after a major anti-ISIS counter strike Syrian army units and
[30:07.680 --> 30:10.680]  paramilitary forces are seizing control of the province to take back
[30:10.680 --> 30:14.320]  strategically important areas to cut ISIS supply lines operating on a critical
[30:14.320 --> 30:18.120]  highway which leads directly into the Islamic State stronghold on Sunday
[30:18.120 --> 30:21.840]  Syrian troops in Palestinian militia captured a strategically important
[30:21.840 --> 30:26.000]  hilltop which was the last entrenched Islamic State position later that day
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  the Syrian army launched a major assault which also cut the Islamic State's
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.640]  major supply route from Raqqa to the nearby province of Hamah military
[30:32.640 --> 30:35.960]  source brief on the battle toward Reuters quote this is the indication of
[30:35.960 --> 30:39.200]  direction of the coming operations towards Raqqa in general the Raqqa front
[30:39.200 --> 30:43.160]  is open the advance into ISIS held Raqqa would allow Damascus to wreaking control
[30:43.160 --> 30:47.040]  over the region where Syrian government forces have had no presence since 2014
[30:47.040 --> 30:51.280]  it also complicate any move by Saudi Arabia deploy forces into Syria for more

[33:42.360 --> 33:49.640]  you know what info wars main job is hitting the bar bar going up the hill
[33:49.640 --> 33:55.240]  first not being afraid to be attacked on 9-11 it was on the news there they were
[33:55.240 --> 33:58.560]  gonna blow up the Solomon brothers building building 7 to protect other
[33:58.560 --> 34:05.960]  buildings they blew it up and then people would say I was a conspiracy
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.760]  theorist that they ever said blow it up and I would go to New York and I would
[34:09.760 --> 34:15.080]  sit there and interview people who all heard them say on the news NPR CBS CNN
[34:15.080 --> 34:20.240]  Fox News the same thing but Fox and all them wouldn't release the tapes it was
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.840]  weird but then years later MSNBC CNBC NBC they released all their tapes and then
[34:26.840 --> 34:32.880]  BBC did and it was all on the tape an hour before we're gonna bring it down
[34:32.880 --> 34:37.680]  we're gonna blow it up then they announced it had fallen early and then
[34:37.680 --> 34:43.320]  hadn't fallen and then boom boom boom boom boom it fell at freefall speed and
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.440]  then this came out and said actually it did fall at freefall speed impossible
[34:46.440 --> 34:51.360]  from a fire collapse those are nearly impossible and then I interviewed the
[34:51.360 --> 34:54.960]  deputy head of emergency management who was basically told there's bombs the
[34:54.960 --> 35:00.240]  building's gonna be brought down and two weeks later Barry Jennings was dead and
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.840]  then we sent reporters to his house on Long Island and the family wouldn't talk
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.720]  and when everything was being loaded in a moving truck they were relocated very
[35:12.720 --> 35:18.640]  quickly was he even they really even die or they come snatch him up and say
[35:18.640 --> 35:20.800]  we're putting him into a super secret program we're gonna let you know it
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.120]  really happened I don't know but they said he died just like the DC madam just
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.960]  like steak knife the British commando that on my show exposed that British
[35:30.960 --> 35:39.120]  intelligence ran the IRA the violent element of it at the top and I'm not
[35:39.120 --> 35:42.320]  here saying we told you we told you we told you but we're the ones that did it
[35:42.320 --> 35:49.520]  and so on Saturday I'm up here working I called Buckley Hammond Anthony Gucci
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.680]  Artie and Rob do in the morning and I said something big is about to happen I
[35:54.680 --> 35:59.840]  want to have a big wargame scenario in the conference room for at least two
[35:59.840 --> 36:11.000]  hours I want to shoot special reports and I sat in that office Saturday telling
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.080]  them something big is about to happen they're all witnesses to it and of course
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.160]  Scalia was already dead it was that morning I called him about 10 I was
[36:17.160 --> 36:21.920]  like something big but it's not that Scalia is that big he's huge but it's
[36:21.920 --> 36:32.760]  that they do it and seismically what it means is that it's happening just like
[36:32.760 --> 36:35.080]  when you're sitting there at the park bench you feel somebody looking at you
[36:35.080 --> 36:37.680]  turn around a person's hundred yards away staring right at you you know your
[36:37.680 --> 36:41.080]  sixth sense I was just like you got to come into the office something big is
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.920]  about to happen and we were here for seven hours preparing and planning and
[36:46.920 --> 36:51.720]  for scenarios of false flags and assassinations and a sense of urgency
[36:51.720 --> 36:57.120]  to the public and then meanwhile we're shooting Facebook mentions for two
[36:57.120 --> 37:00.800]  hours and people keep saying talk about Scalia talk about Scalia talk about
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.080]  Scalia and I'm in this desperate two-hour rant was like an hour and 50
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.920]  minutes long the video stopped once it was in two parts live in the conference
[37:08.920 --> 37:12.880]  room with sweat running down they weren't sweating I had sweat running
[37:12.880 --> 37:19.760]  down me it's 65 degrees in here folks and I'm sweating right now that happens
[37:19.760 --> 37:28.960]  when I'm freaked out okay my brain's going a million miles an hour and all I
[37:28.960 --> 37:41.520]  can tell you is all hell's about to break loose so then I'm driving home and
[37:41.520 --> 37:44.880]  I'm listening to the radio and they had just announced an hour and a half before
[37:44.880 --> 37:48.440]  that he was found dead nothing to see here looks like natural causes which they
[37:48.440 --> 37:52.280]  never say and I call Bucklin and I said that's it I got to come over to your
[37:52.280 --> 37:59.600]  place I want to do another video and I get up there and I say he's a key
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.880]  Supreme Court justice there's more than 50 big cases the second amendment
[38:03.880 --> 38:09.000]  hanging the balance our borders our sovereignty these UN treaties he's not
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.880]  going along with Obamacare like the other Republicans that have reportedly
[38:11.880 --> 38:21.040]  been blackmailed Clarence Thomas I'd like to hear from him I'll say this Matt
[38:21.040 --> 38:24.000]  drudge came here when he's only done like one of their interview the last five
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.760]  years came here a few months ago to say I've had dinner with the top Supreme
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.240]  Court justice more than a dinner he was with him for like a day he told me the
[38:32.240 --> 38:35.920]  hammers coming down next year we've been threatened to basically go along with it
[38:35.920 --> 38:42.040]  and he talked about this on air and he told me more obviously at dinner but
[38:42.040 --> 38:45.920]  but drudge was here because he's concerned
[38:45.920 --> 38:51.640]  see so the Sydney Morning Herald can make jokes and hundreds of other
[38:51.640 --> 38:58.280]  newspapers can make jokes and all these publications can make jokes Anthony
[38:58.280 --> 39:04.480]  Scalia's death sets off hysteria conspiracy theories but it doesn't matter
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.760]  see I'm credible with the actual people that are in the real world who have
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.240]  dinner with multiple Supreme Court justices and you wouldn't believe who
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.760]  else was in the room talking about what you just saw happened and so I and
[39:17.760 --> 39:20.640]  obviously drudge began to look into him being killed immediately because
[39:20.640 --> 39:24.680]  evidence was emerging and drudge is being criticized for that you know because
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.200]  he's the top of guy that has dinner with these people see because when you live
[39:28.200 --> 39:33.000]  in the real world like I do and the military threatens to kill you if you
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.320]  keep talking about the NSA 18 years ago oh you learn that there is a tyranny
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.840]  then you learn the military has basically told the government you have
[39:44.840 --> 39:48.000]  somebody else killed Jones we're not going to do it and by the way
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.760]  information is going to leak about whoever kills him you've heard Steve
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.040]  Pachinic on air who's personally killed a lot of people himself overthrown more
[39:56.040 --> 40:03.520]  than eight governments is on record for that knew how to use psychological
[40:03.520 --> 40:07.120]  warfare to make the communist duty wanted to in Italy the list goes on and
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.800]  on that's a real guy that co-wrote books with Tom Clancy that's where Clancy
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.920]  got his info saying yeah they're in horseman discussions about killing you
[40:14.920 --> 40:20.360]  at high levels but they know there's people that support what you're doing
[40:20.360 --> 40:26.240]  that are going to leak if you're killed folks there is a full-on war for the
[40:26.240 --> 40:32.800]  country right now 110% this isn't a radio show this is an entertainment this
[40:32.800 --> 40:38.840]  isn't a game this is an emergency transmission I'm nothing but a Paul
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.080]  Revere and I'm not special I learned about this early on I was a paleo
[40:43.080 --> 40:46.920]  libertarian conservative I got on air and I would talk about things other
[40:46.920 --> 40:52.680]  people wouldn't talk about so I became a conduit for sources to put out their
[40:52.680 --> 40:59.840]  info and I was willing to die to do it because my forebears were the same and
[40:59.840 --> 41:06.800]  I'm cut from the same cloth even though I grew up in a softer age I have a will
[41:06.800 --> 41:12.040]  to survive a will to not be overthrown a will to not be a slave and that's what
[41:12.040 --> 41:20.480]  made America great was not rolling over and so the reason I talk about myself
[41:20.480 --> 41:30.800]  or Matt drudge in all of this is because I'm in this I'm in this I'm living in
[41:30.800 --> 41:39.640]  this I talk to the retired generals I talk to the people in the military
[41:39.640 --> 41:42.320]  currently high-level
[41:42.320 --> 41:55.080]  there are former heads of special forces and others I've talked to three
[41:55.080 --> 41:59.360]  actually some of the former heads of army special forces before they got
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.320]  promoted above that who have security details that they have to pay for around
[42:04.320 --> 42:15.000]  the clock and let me tell you boys and girls it isn't for al-qaeda coming after
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.080]  you understand that folks there's already been a coup over America and now
[42:21.080 --> 42:26.120]  they want to mop the states up they they're trying to indict governor Abbott
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.520]  they are they are trying to cook they are already indicted his attorney general
[42:29.520 --> 42:34.040]  who is shooing Obama and brought the cases that are before Scalia on the open
[42:34.040 --> 42:38.600]  borders on the gun grabbing on the power plants they just said you know we're
[42:38.600 --> 42:45.880]  gonna indict you at dinner a year after you gave up your your your stock license
[42:45.880 --> 42:49.760]  your securities license you told people you thought a certain company ought to be
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.000]  a good investment we're gonna indict you for that while Hillary gets billions
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.640]  of dollars from foreign dictators in front of everybody to ship weapons to
[42:57.640 --> 43:05.760]  them they can indict a ham sandwich and you notice Abbott just came out and said
[43:05.760 --> 43:08.800]  come and take our guns you're a tyrant we need to get the states together there's
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.680]  been basically a foreign takeover and we need other governors to act just the
[43:13.680 --> 43:16.360]  same way
[43:16.360 --> 43:27.320]  folks this isn't a game maybe they'll find the governor with a pillow over his
[43:27.320 --> 43:30.800]  face maybe that's the new thing all these conservatives they're fighting back
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.240]  to the real conservatives they're all being found with pillows over their
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.680]  faces and then they announced no autopsy you know in Arkansas they would just
[43:38.680 --> 43:41.960]  have family Malik when people were found with their arms and legs cut off we
[43:41.960 --> 43:51.640]  fact we've got to get we've got to get the Clinton insider on from Arkansas
[43:51.640 --> 43:59.360]  Larry Nichols yeah I don't know what to say anymore to people I mean this is just
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.280]  gonna get worse because the average American watches football all day but
[44:03.280 --> 44:10.200]  there's a paradox happening here because as all of this is happening the public
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.920]  says the US government's the number one threat to their freedom and future in
[44:13.920 --> 44:19.160]  Gallup and that they support Congress 9% they have identity politics with
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.640]  Democrat Republican Party so some of those characters you know have 30 40%
[44:22.640 --> 44:25.880]  of people writings but still this government is illegitimate it knows
[44:25.880 --> 44:31.560]  it's illegitimate and it's busy trying to make you as poor as you possibly can
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.440]  so you're so busy trying to get food you can never organize any type of
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.160]  political resistance against what they've done and then they're trying to set up a
[44:40.160 --> 44:44.160]  physical civil war so they have an excuse to run around arresting millions of
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.120]  people and they publicly haven't built giant emergencies quote centers to
[44:49.120 --> 44:58.600]  forequote political dissidents and call them reeducation camps that's in the
[44:58.600 --> 45:02.760]  Army manual 2010 you say yeah that's scared in FEMA camp that's the
[45:02.760 --> 45:08.480]  colloquial name normally with 1984 stuff they'd call it a fun camp like Hillary
[45:08.480 --> 45:16.640]  did or something now they call it a reeducation center reeducation center
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.920]  and they just hope you don't go search engine army document reeducation center
[45:21.920 --> 45:31.800]  army document resettlement center I mean they actually want to have a giant
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.280]  civil war and they think the gun owners and people are gonna roll over in it
[45:35.280 --> 45:40.440]  when the shooting starts and that's not gonna happen I cannot even that's why
[45:40.440 --> 45:45.560]  you've got thousands of sheriffs now coming out and saying we're not turning
[45:45.560 --> 45:50.880]  the guns and don't try to take them I was talking to a gentleman who's
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.800]  prominent in a Utah town and I'm not gonna report on this yet but it was when
[45:54.800 --> 45:58.800]  Jade home happened and the army was on the streets and he talked to the county
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.960]  people and others I'm gonna stop there and it was exactly what we have on tape
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.000]  under Clinton in Hebron Maryland in police state 2000 where they got the
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.200]  local Boy Scouts to run around for the Marines and train them to go in and
[46:12.200 --> 46:15.360]  identify how many guns their parents have in their house and to come back and
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.760]  report it to the Marines on paper and we even have the kids reporting back to
[46:19.760 --> 46:30.800]  the Marines and then our camera guy the Marines come over with their rifles and
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.520]  the state police and try to take their footage we have it on video so I don't
[46:35.520 --> 46:39.320]  need to hear it from this fellow who by the way not seen my film I was a
[46:39.320 --> 46:43.280]  gentleman mm-hmm that's the one I've known for years and it's someone who's
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.840]  very credible and it's someone who's prominent in his area and he said yeah
[46:47.840 --> 46:59.200]  it was crazy was it an imminent takeover no but a few months before that they
[46:59.200 --> 47:03.160]  had had more than 30 sheriffs in Utah come out and say we're not letting you
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.640]  take the guns if you try to confiscate them we're gonna physically fight you
[47:06.640 --> 47:10.520]  you've seen these different state judges and stuff in Texas say the same thing
[47:10.520 --> 47:16.080]  that's cuz they're privy to what I'm privy to and things I'm not privy to this
[47:16.080 --> 47:21.520]  is an open secret now the special forces isn't just doing this to be friends and
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.080]  some style they are totally freaked out and we're like it's all true I have
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.880]  senior level police senior level military people you name it sit there and
[47:30.880 --> 47:36.160]  look at me and hang on every word and go yes sir yes sir yes yes yes I'm a 42
[47:36.160 --> 47:41.120]  year old talk show host I don't okay it's just people won't stand up there's no
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.320]  leadership because it's so fantastical but these these police and military
[47:46.320 --> 47:51.120]  they're in there they're getting the training at a level 50 times what it was
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.800]  under Clinton because they're getting ready to go operational and killing
[47:55.800 --> 48:02.040]  Scalia okay they didn't kill Scalia and Hillary won six coin causes them in a
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.520]  row and she lost by 20 points in New Hampshire but she won more delegates
[48:05.520 --> 48:08.760]  okay there's nothing wrong here everything's fine go back to sleep Obama
[48:08.760 --> 48:12.240]  has announced the borders are open illegally outside of law the board of
[48:12.240 --> 48:17.600]  patrol Union had has gone public it's all admitted we have it on video ourselves
[48:17.600 --> 48:21.440]  doesn't matter though we're not under a tyranny you're right Sydney morning

[48:32.400 --> 48:37.400]  and actually oh I saw another disinfo thing in the news they tried Sunday to
[48:37.400 --> 48:41.840]  say I was a liar in a bunch of news and that there was no pillow over the face
[48:41.840 --> 48:48.280]  article even in the comment section of the very San Antonio Express news even
[48:48.280 --> 48:53.320]  on my site and even on other newspapers they said Jones claims he had a pillow I
[48:53.320 --> 48:58.080]  didn't say that the guy that reportedly found him said that see how they operate
[48:58.080 --> 49:07.000]  hoping you don't actually go look at the facts for yourself now let's continue
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.200]  here I'm gonna go to break and come back and go over all this and I'm gonna

[54:16.680 --> 54:21.120]  journalist Wayne Mads when joining us the bottom of the next hour we're also
[54:21.120 --> 54:25.760]  going to get back to a church hearing clip from cease man when them showing the
[54:25.760 --> 54:31.760]  CIA's heart attack gun but they've got hundreds of poisons and compounds and
[54:31.760 --> 54:37.680]  synthetic compounds that will kill you and will be untraceable Dr. David Kelly
[54:37.680 --> 54:41.200]  exposed that there weren't any WNBs in Iraq that they were ordered to falsify
[54:41.200 --> 54:45.520]  the reports that was later confirmed he said I've been threatened if I don't
[54:45.520 --> 54:49.560]  shut up in emails I'll be found dead in the woods he was found dead in the woods
[54:49.560 --> 54:54.280]  with his wrist lit with no blood and a bunch of undissolved painkillers in a
[54:54.280 --> 54:59.200]  stomach even the coroner came out and said basically foul play and they had
[54:59.200 --> 55:03.680]  other coroners in a key in a Queens Commission come out and say no like
[55:03.680 --> 55:08.400]  Princess Diana's murder she was pregnant
[55:08.880 --> 55:16.320]  so you know to the owner of Herod's son Herod's department store I mean it's so
[55:16.320 --> 55:24.040]  ridiculous how they operate and they do it over and over and over again but I
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.240]  want to explain something here from the time of Julius Caesar and before that and
[55:29.240 --> 55:33.720]  forward political intrigue murder poisoning every king throughout history
[55:33.720 --> 55:39.560]  and his adjuncts had food tasters because the poisoning Scalia is the
[55:39.560 --> 55:45.200]  equivalent of a mega king the key justice the tiebreaker justice to stop
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.920]  the globalist agenda the gun control everything and then he dies and then they
[55:49.920 --> 55:56.960]  instantly say looks like natural causes we died of a heart attack well you
[55:56.960 --> 56:00.280]  didn't have a doctor say that well somebody over her telephone said that
[56:00.280 --> 56:03.720]  oh now it wasn't a heart attack we don't know but there's not gonna be an
[56:03.720 --> 56:07.960]  autopsy they have a judge the next morning rule the same judge that's
[56:07.960 --> 56:11.680]  ruled by the way in a bunch of other bizarre cases quote suicides and things
[56:11.680 --> 56:15.360]  with gunshot wounds to the head with children and things we're digging into
[56:15.360 --> 56:18.160]  this Paul Watson just called me during the break I'm gonna work on getting him
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.920]  on I already saw this but he's codifying it that the owner of the ranch is a
[56:21.920 --> 56:31.240]  mega Obama donor and other connections Scalia loved to hunt boy didn't he and
[56:31.240 --> 56:37.840]  he walked right in to a very interesting place and that's all coming up in the
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.880]  next hour we discovered the judge in bed a pillow over his head ranch owner
[56:42.880 --> 56:48.400]  describes moment he discovered Scalia as an autopsy is ruled out following death
[56:48.400 --> 56:52.640]  from natural causes I love it you have an autopsy determined death but see now
[56:52.640 --> 57:00.560]  autopsy is a ruled out by someone on a telephone a federal officer said maybe
[57:00.560 --> 57:05.520]  the federal officer can wave a wand and make North Korea a free country maybe
[57:05.520 --> 57:08.960]  that he can wave a wand over rotten milk and make it good again I mean what is
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.560]  this and now they're saying it wasn't a heart attack now they're changing the
[57:13.560 --> 57:17.920]  story over and over and over again I'm gonna go over all that coming up I
[57:17.920 --> 57:21.440]  haven't even gotten into the meat and potatoes yet but you see them making
[57:21.440 --> 57:25.240]  jokes about this you see them attacking you see it because they're scared to
[57:25.240 --> 57:28.040]  death that you'd actually investigate it they want the general public just to
[57:28.040 --> 57:32.040]  believe whatever they're told believe Obamacare's free believe Hillary's gonna
[57:32.040 --> 57:36.240]  win even if she loses the popular vote you know believe that two plus two equals
[57:36.240 --> 57:39.360]  five and you didn't build your business and you know mommy's and daddy's are bad
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.080]  all of this inversion of reality they don't want you to question but to the
[57:44.080 --> 57:51.080]  thinking man the thinking woman I'm surprised again they didn't put a horse
[57:51.080 --> 57:54.680]  head in the bed with him for you know I'll have a godfather I mean let's go
[57:54.680 --> 57:57.400]  back to the godfather you know they got creeping around with a pillow at the
[57:57.400 --> 58:05.560]  hospital and are trying to take out the competition I mean you have to catch the
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.120]  guy with the pillow over his face and again why would they say there was a
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.600]  pillow over his face what is the point of that you read the cryptic statements
[58:14.600 --> 58:20.880]  about he was a fabulous person the night incredible guy and just the whole
[58:20.880 --> 58:26.480]  thing you read it it's creepy read the statements we're gonna be right back

[1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:24.880]  line of the info war it's not just the death of the key Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia that
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:29.120]  sends up emergency red flags it's the open announcements of preparation with
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.120]  toe-to-toe war against Russian troops using US and other troops NATO troops
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:38.920]  in Ukraine and in Syria mainline analysts saying the buildup to World War
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.400]  3 is in pants not my words there's we have those in the stack we have the UN
[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:48.000]  telling national governments how to behave mainstream news reporting on
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.720]  that we've got scores of news articles making fun of me saying I'm warning of
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:57.720]  the UN regulations and treaties that it doesn't exist I mean it's just total
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:01:03.240]  schizophrenic behavior absolutely schizophrenic behavior where Anthony
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:07.080]  Scalia's death sets off hysteria conspiracy theories Alex Jones thinks
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:10.480]  that we're under UN treaties and UN control oh here's the one independent
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:15.560]  today United Nations warns UK government to stop tasering children or says
[1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:19.160]  they'll bring them up on war crime charges and your violation of the Geneva
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:23.560]  Convention and regardless what you think about tasers the UN is the most
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:26.720]  abusive group towards children I've ever found or seen I mean there's their sex
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.920]  scandals are every five minutes the sex slavery the drug running the
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:37.200]  corruption it's a diplomatically immune legion of doom they mean the UN
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:40.720]  building all you know fly around like it's own spaceship and just landed
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:45.960]  villages and murder everybody because if that's about how bad it is as an
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:52.360]  allegory I'm not saying it actually does that case Rachel Maddow is confused and
[1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:55.480]  they just make jokes and then right here United Nations warns UK government to
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:58.520]  stop tasering children they're gonna come after them this is the type of stuff
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:03.280]  we're dealing with but I have to behave myself today because I need to get to all
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:06.960]  the election news I need to get to all the economic news I need to get to the
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:12.960]  other political news I mean it is crazy but the Scalia thing is that Rosetta
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:18.240]  Stone is that key there's so many other keys as well that if you understand that
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:23.400]  you understand everything because this is just spectacular
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:29.760]  spectacular what's going on and I suddenly saw last week this weekend
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:33.120]  scores of articles because I mean I'm surfing around looking at headlines and
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:39.000]  I saw it on CNN and Fox and it was when hackers turn off your lights and they
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.320]  go oh all your major appliances can be hacked and taken over in fact they're
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:48.560]  designed to be wide open your security cameras your dishwasher your stove could
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:54.680]  burn down your house hackers I mean I try to put appliances in my house that
[1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:58.360]  they're just old-fashioned and just don't don't have all this wireless crap that
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:02.480]  never works and screws up constantly and you try to put a cable system in your
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.840]  house that doesn't have cameras and microphones and isn't tracking everything
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:08.800]  you do you just can't do it and then it doesn't even work good on top of it
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:12.960]  because it's not designed to bring you entertainment or information it's designed
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:19.320]  to spy on you your phone is a social control system to track everything you
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:25.040]  do follow you around and then the apps and the video games and the toys and the
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:29.960]  cameras are secondary for your pleasure it's there to be psychologically
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:34.560]  assessing you with algorithms at all times and the CIA admitted it five years
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:38.920]  ago and we would talk about it what Petraeus and others said in the news we
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:42.680]  already knew it we told you decades before but it didn't matter they would
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:46.520]  have articles going Jones is insane and believes that your washing machine or
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:51.920]  your stove is going to be listening and watching you I was quoting Petraeus in
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:57.000]  Wired magazine and it was the headline and they knew that they were editing the
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:03.240]  tapes to make it sound fantastical and as if I was saying it like talking about
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:07.960]  all over the Western world amphibians and fish are becoming asexual or
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:12.840]  bisexual or losing their fertility from the runoff of what we're drinking and
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:17.280]  eating the glyphosates the rest of it the cocktail they have had thousands of
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:24.480]  articles that I'm obsessed with gay frogs out of context there it is CIA chief
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:33.480]  will spy on you through your dishwasher Wired magazine 2012 see but the media
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.920]  attacked me on that and I said listen I'm not attacking people that would be
[1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:41.640]  naturally quote gay I'm saying there's proclivities with certain hormones and
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:45.720]  chemicals to confuse male and female sexuality if you would have been inclined
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:50.560]  towards the dominant you know default straight setting and then I showed
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:53.960]  Pentagon documents how they admitted they were doing this to the public and so
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:58.120]  their response was just to say I'm obsessed with gay frogs
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:02.280]  was the Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia assassinated there's growing
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:06.320]  evidence suggesting that yes he was Scalia who once said he interpreted the
[1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:09.080]  bill arise no different than the founding fathers was found dead in his
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:12.320]  room while staying at a ranch owned by a Democratic donor in the remote Big Bend
[1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:15.440]  region of West Texas for one thing Percival County Judge Sarela
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:18.600]  Gabbana first claimed the Scalia died of heart attack and then she later backed
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:22.400]  off that statement and claimed instead that he died of natural causes with no
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:26.280]  signs of foul play but she never saw the body in fact the Supreme Court Justice
[1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:30.240]  was found with a pillow over his head not only was there no autopsy performed on
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:34.000]  Scalia but his body was also rushed to a funeral home to be quickly embalmed a
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.360]  process which would destroy toxicology evidence indicating whether he had been
[1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:41.200]  poisoned the Arch Conservatives Scalia also opposed many of Obama's policies on
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:44.840]  illegal immigration in gun control and Obama benefits from his death by now
[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:47.760]  being able to appoint his own judge who will undoubtedly rubber-stamp the

[1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:17.080]  know I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I really want to do a good
[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:20.600]  job on the interview I got my bottle of brain force right there pop two of them
[1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:25.040]  and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything just kind of clears up
[1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:29.160]  got four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why

[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:40.680]  pulled it all night or like that in a while but I probably could not have

[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:32.800]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:45.560]  the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:51.480]  we had talks on more than a decade ago and I've done countless articles and
[1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:58.000]  reports about the new light bulbs that were mandatory under UN regulations to
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:04.400]  be installed worldwide that we've now adopted under federal law causing cancer
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:10.800]  and brain damage and here is a mainstream news article from Tel Aviv
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:17.200]  from French news agency new Israeli study artificial light causes weight gain
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:20.600]  and cancer you know I thought I just mentioned that because the media has
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:23.720]  made fun of us for that as well we were just going off the top scientists you
[1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:26.840]  know just like cell phone radiations known to cause cancer we're just being
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:34.760]  honest we have a whole other stack of articles here getting into life of
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:38.240]  states admittedly causing cancer and how they told you it was totally safe and
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:41.480]  good for you when they knew full well and rat studies in the 60s that it
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:46.200]  actually grows tumors it's so carcinogen I mean so carcinogenic it makes my
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:50.880]  head spin actually grows tumors it's a miracle grow for mammals to die so it's
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:55.520]  miracle death for the miracle grow which of course isn't a life of state it's
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:00.200]  fertilizer I'm saying that the life of states roundups it's it's brand name the
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:07.520]  good folks at Monsanto is basically super tumor grower so if you'd like to
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:11.280]  check out and get off the planet real quick hey I understand just where the
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:17.120]  evil conspiracy theorist that told you about that 20 years ago because you see
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:21.360]  in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated feared scorn in time when his
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:24.280]  cause exceeds the time it joined him because then it cost nothing to be a
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:31.240]  patriot that's why within 30 minutes of Scalia's death I went on air and said we
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:35.440]  should investigate foul play there must be an autopsy if they don't want an
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.400]  autopsy and the fact that they instantly said we're not gonna investigate this
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:45.520]  doesn't look like it could be any foul play an anonymous federal phone call
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:49.200]  different stories changing he died of a heart attack he didn't die of a heart
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:53.000]  attack we don't know how we died but we know it was natural the story changed
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:59.080]  over and over again and now ladies and gentlemen I saw this last night I did the
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:04.760]  research actually Saturday evening but wanted to give it more time for stuff to
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:08.780]  come out and I his statement about how he had dinner with him that night the
[1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:13.400]  owner of the ranch with all these cast and what he talked to Scalia about and
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:16.920]  then what he said about Scalia and then he comes there in the morning and he
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:25.720]  goes in to check on Scalia and Scalia is dead with a pillow on his face and who
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:28.880]  is the owner of the ranch
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:35.960]  John B. Poindexter no no not Admiral Poindexter of the total information
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:40.880]  awareness network in Iran Contra but John Poindexter is a third generation
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:44.720]  Texan and military veteran and an entrepreneur who lives in Houston and
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:51.800]  Big Bend region of West Texas this is from his biography in 2009 the
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:58.000]  presidential unit citation was conferred on John's Vietnam command of four
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:05.760]  decades earlier alpha true 11th armored cavalry regiment you know I don't
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.600]  know about the army research in these groups I mean this guy is a on-the-ground
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:14.460]  commando killer and then it goes into all his decorations in Vietnam and secret
[1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:20.400]  operations boy this is a very friendly person the nation's highest decoration
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:25.600]  for combat unit was awarded to alpha true for the truly extraordinary rescue
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:28.720]  against all odds of an American infantry company that was facing certain
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:32.320]  annihilation the granting of the decoration was commemorated in the
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:35.600]  national televised ceremony in the Rose Garden the White House presided over by
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:39.520]  President Obama and then it goes into how with a big buddy of Obama he is and
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:46.600]  a big contributor to Obama putting to him and his military service portion John
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:50.440]  graduated and got education began in financial center in New York City he
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:56.240]  joined Solomon brothers oh building seven worked in building seven were the CIA and
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:59.040]  FBI on the net there wasn't a more elite building in the world that was
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:03.720]  private than building seven that was the command base of New York FBI CIA NSA
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:10.400]  army intelligence but within a few years he transitioned into private equity
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:14.160]  investment later and he became a partner with Smith Barney venture company an
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:18.800]  affiliate with Smith Barney Harris up them and later in 83 he was managing
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:24.320]  partner of the two investment partnerships KD and P equities and JB
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:29.080]  poindexter and co and acquired companies with a aggregated revenues of more than
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.440]  one billion a year I'm gonna stop right there and and Watson's writing article
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:37.600]  right now digging into this guy I'm sure he's a wonderful person we just need
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:42.880]  to have a an investigation and I'm sure he wants one oh I'm sorry a judge ruled
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:47.400]  that the next morning that there'll be no autopsy and they wouldn't tell us what
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:51.840]  was going on but we but he found him with the pillow over his face and he
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:56.040]  added there was a pillow over his face that was a very nice little added a little
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:14:01.200]  little added message to folks that have more than a you know 75 IQ thank you
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:06.960]  commander for your statement we really appreciate that
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:14.240]  but again there's no political assassinations there's no intrigue I
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:19.280]  mean Hillary really did win six coin tosses in Iowa to win the key delegate
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:22.760]  and she really did lose by 20 points but still got more delegates in New
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:27.920]  Hampshire nothing's happening and Ron Brown the army coroner said had a 45
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:31.800]  bullet hole through his head so a bunch of other people on board the plane that
[1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:34.720]  was a commerce secretary who said he'd bring the Clintons down if they tried to
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:38.400]  bring him down you know they actually brought him down I could go on for a
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:41.680]  long time here in the death behind the Clintons and the rest of it and I'm not
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:47.440]  saying who killed Scalia if he was murdered I'm saying he maybe he wasn't
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:52.000]  murdered maybe he died of natural causes like JFK did in 1963 and we have footage
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  of that can we cue that up please
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:59.480]  now the Daily Democrat now though the newspaper is telling us about his last
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:04.120]  hours on the Texas ranch in that sweet but but but before I go further into
[1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:09.040]  this oh let's go back point dexter's made more statements now eventually
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:13.120]  point dexter entered the silent room apprehensively I was worried I was going
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:18.080]  to find something very tragic he said well his earlier quotes was is that
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:22.840]  Scalia was fine and it was a 9 o'clock he said he was tired you know went to bed
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:27.120]  and then he didn't come to breakfast so he came to look on him but now he was
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:36.880]  afraid he'd find something very tragic and the Psyop is deep on this one like
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:44.000]  building seven had a lot of depth it did it sure did and its own whole railway
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.400]  station and things oh I'm sorry let's continue here used to work there you're
[1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:50.680]  nice person here here let's go ahead and show this is footage for the mainstream
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:55.600]  media I agree that there's no foul play and Justice Clea's death we're showing
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:59.360]  for TV viewers the subreder film anybody wants to see the natural causes I
[1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:03.560]  mean of course there shouldn't be an autopsy of JFK and of course we
[1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:06.720]  shouldn't look into it or ask questions he I'm officially telling you he died of
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:10.320]  natural causes just like Scalia but there'll be no autopsy that's completely
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:16.240]  normal now I'm not actually saying that mr. pointextra is a bad guy he's
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:19.640]  probably a wonderful person maybe he did just come in and magically feel like he
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:22.480]  was gonna find something tragic and then found the pillow over the face and
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:31.160]  everything but this narrative is so twisted and they've changed the story so
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:38.440]  many times it's almost like now they want us to think he was killed this is
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:43.680]  just over the top that you've got a guy with a total intelligence cut out sheep
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:50.640]  dip background at the highest levels and billions of dollars and this is where
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:57.680]  Scalia goes to go dove hunting at this private hotel and then he sits right
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:02.360]  next to this friendly fellow this is Obama supporter and then all of this
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:07.400]  happens well let me just say from an eighth or ninth generation text into a
[1:17:07.400 --> 1:17:11.520]  third generation Texan mr. pointextra we're gonna investigate this and we're
[1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:15.280]  we're very hopeful that you and others when we come down to your place and
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:17.480]  everything I know it's private property but I'm sure you're gonna want us to
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:21.200]  you know check in and pay pay to stay there and everything 500 bucks a night
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:24.480]  for your smaller rooms is fine for us for an investigation maybe I'll come on
[1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:30.000]  down there and in it oh but I bet it's sewed up tighter than a drum down there
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.200]  just something tells me that but let's go to Joe Biggs and then we're also going
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:40.600]  to go to get Daniels who is in there in the news center I tell you you look at
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:44.520]  all this in our race Scalia death puts gun rights in jeopardy Anthony Scalia's
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:48.160]  death could mark the end of the Constitution GOP candidates urged Senate
[1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:52.520]  to block Obama's Supreme Court pick then we got the report here again with a
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:59.240]  pillow over his face but for me it's the instantly reporting an anonymous call
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:04.120]  Obama New Hours before it comes out of a small TV station and we're told nothing
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:08.440]  to see here the body's been flown back to Virginia just just your crazy to ask
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:11.720]  questions Joe Biggs I mean I guess we're crazy to ask questions about Kennedy
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:16.240]  to very interesting I mean like you said John pointextra was a millionaire who
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:19.760]  gave money to the Democrat Party this guy was awarded military honors from
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:24.120]  President Obama now he has this ranch that he comes to he's coming towards the
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:28.760]  end of his term he said he would change America this is his time to do it was
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:32.640]  Scalia being gone then they could appoint someone like Loretta Lynch if you
[1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:35.840]  go to drudge report right now and actually pull up on the left side of the
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:39.840]  top up there it shows that they are talking about Loretta Lynch possibly
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:44.400]  being the person to feel his shoes what happens when you take out someone like
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:48.760]  that he was a true conservative he was a the only one we had in there you bring
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:53.200]  in Loretta Lynch into this situation what happens Obama can really change
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:56.360]  America that's it and then what happens you bring in a socialist like Bernie
[1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:59.960]  Sanders for someone who's completely evil like Hillary Clinton for that final
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:03.440]  blow this is probably this is the final assault this is the beginning of the
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:07.320]  final war this is the most important thing we're gonna see 2016 will be the
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:12.880]  biggest year of our lives deciding the future battle space exactly I mean to
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:16.040]  see what's gonna happen with this you know and we've got footage I think they
[1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:19.880]  played it yesterday with David Knight as well have the CIA had this heart
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:24.640]  attack on it's his high-powered pistol that shoots a frozen round into the body
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:28.280]  only leaves a small prick and then simulates like a heart attack of my
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:31.600]  old cardio and farsion or whatever like that and that's all that's left so if
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:34.920]  they go and the point is they have these they do these political killings are
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:38.760]  classic but this is old-fashioned pillow over the face hold the old guy down you
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:42.000]  get three guys on them one on the legs one on the midsection one of the top and
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.640]  then smother them you can kill them in two minutes the point Dexter's I mean he
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:50.280]  was old he wasn't great health I could kill him easily personally by myself it's
[1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:53.440]  sick stay right there Joe bags if you're a trained killer you can tell us more

[1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:13.720]  Usiarty and Buckley back there in one of the newsrooms and I said this is a bold
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:19.520]  move because people don't buy into the system anymore it's very obvious and I
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:23.240]  said what what's your dead reckoning and Anthony said they left the pillow on his
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:28.160]  face they told us about it they told us no foul play instantly and then had a
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:33.680]  judge order no autopsy instantly it stinks to the heavens with the timing
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:37.560]  and the rest of it and then he goes out the middle of nowhere to a place with
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:43.640]  it with a Democrat black ops army commander who worked into the most
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:50.040]  shadowy CIA run brokerage firms that quarterback the whole deal in New York I
[1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:57.240]  mean these are the names and they come out and say things and change the story
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:06.680]  over and over again this is either the worst handled story ever to make us
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:09.600]  think they killed him or they or somebody killed him I mean folks I'm an
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:14.200]  expert at this this is all I do okay and all the big brains agree I don't know
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:16.720]  what Matt's gonna say coming up but he's a smart guy I'm gonna send him down
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:20.920]  there by the way Matt's is getting ready to get on a plane today and I'm sending
[1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:25.520]  more people down there and I'm letting them know we're coming so you want to
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:28.600]  act like it's bad we're coming I'm sure you're good people down there no no if
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:30.800]  there was foul play somebody might have snuck on there and done it at night
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:35.920]  because he was coaxed into going by who we need to find out and ask some
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:38.920]  questions needs to be investigation without his security detail which he
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:43.200]  always has to the middle of nowhere with this guy that made tens of billions
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:46.080]  of dollars you know in the aggregate for his company hundreds of billions
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:51.240]  himself reportedly who gets awards from Obama to a Democrat run facility that
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:57.440]  all these liberals go to him with no security before I go somewhere folks I
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:01.400]  look at who owns it and who's around it let me tell you the Democrats operate
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:05.560]  the low level they will call the police on you if you walk out of a restaurant
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:09.120]  and have one beer and the cop will pull you over and you know that's the story
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:12.640]  they will they will make stuff up about you they will call the neighborhood
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:15.400]  association on you that's just what they do it the if you see all the
[1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:18.600]  Democrats in the news saying let's make a movie about killing conservatives let's
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:24.640]  kill conservatives let's kill the Tea Party all these professors they're
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:28.320]  playing dirty they're taking over I'm gonna hold you guys in the next segment
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:31.760]  we're gonna play the heart attack gun piece from the congressional hearings
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.840]  from the church committee but I want to go back to Joe Biggs for just a moment
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:40.360]  and then back to Kit Daniels we haven't talked to you yet but I'm telling you
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:44.920]  you couldn't write a Tom Clancy book this crazy truth is stranger than fiction
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.280]  Joe I wish he wouldn't have died but I really wish he would have died of
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:52.920]  natural causes and they just said well he was old might have had some health
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:56.240]  problems we're doing autopsy and that'll come out and then we see who is the
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.600]  coroner what is the evidence we gauge it but the way they hit the ground running
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:04.920]  with the scripting I mean baby this is bad what happened right before the
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:09.600]  Republican debate to be before the body was even cold the Democrats are coming
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:12.800]  out talking about who they're gonna get what they're looking for I mean that
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:16.520]  that's kind of a sign there's something going on the fact you have this John
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:20.200]  Poindexter guy coming out originally saying oh he died peacefully well how do
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:24.040]  you know that you showed up after that after the fact apparently and then
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:26.520]  there's this pillow on your face and all of a sudden you're saying that well I
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:30.960]  had a bad feeling you know these guys were frothing at the mouth for this and
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:33.880]  then like you said you go back to drudge report and you can see that they're
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.600]  talking about possibly putting Loretta Lynch in as his replacement now let's
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:43.280]  think about that now he's in another newspaper the Democrat being interviewed
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:46.000]  in person by him I guess he might be a good guy who just didn't know what's
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.200]  going on probably the wonderful guy I'm sure he is but going oh my gosh you had
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:54.600]  a bad feeling just a few hours after he hadn't come out in the morning that he
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:58.400]  was gonna find something this is bizarre let's go to Kit Daniels while I
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:03.920]  actually pull up the Attorney General Lynch is who they're looking to put in
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.800]  there the lady that openly says the president can audit whoever he wants
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.760]  take your guns you name it let's go to Kit Daniels Kit yes Alex it's really
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  interesting to note that Presidio County is a very it's a Democratic run
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:22.440]  County you know just like you said the ranch is democratically owned and
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.360]  controlled the Democrats like to be close to the border there's some goodies
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:29.680]  that go back and forth yeah it was one of the few counties in Texas that voted
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:33.000]  for a bomb in 2008 I also believe in 2012 I mean there's probably only about
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.840]  six counties that I know of that are heavily Democratic and Presidio County
[1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:42.280]  is one of them so it'd be very easy to control the local officials there when
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:45.920]  they're on your side exactly Scalia walked into the perfect bear trap the
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:52.880]  whole thing was perfect and and of course expanding on that kit maybe it is a
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:57.520]  coincidence and Hillary did win six coin tosses in a row in Iowa I doubt that
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:02.440]  but it's also interesting to note about Scalia he was very influential on the
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:06.920]  formation of the I think it's called the Federalist Society which is a society
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:12.640]  for libertarian and conservative law students who like Scalia had a vested
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:16.280]  interest in a an originalist interpretation of Constitution i.e. how
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:19.880]  their founding fathers meant the yeah let's boil it down and come back and
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:24.320]  talk more on that he was the only half decent one there other than Clarence
[1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:28.800]  Thomas who said I'm leading a revolution against these revolutionaries to
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:33.440]  battle them and to stop them and he was organizing and resisting and now him
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:36.920]  dying will intimidate the rest of the court I'm gonna come back to you on that
[1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:40.440]  kit back to Joe Beggs will play the heart attack gun piece and then bring in
[1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:44.440]  Wayne Madsen investigative journalist to get his take formally with the National

[1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:19.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on the
[1:33:19.640 --> 1:33:31.560]  GCN radio network. I am doing everything I can to control myself over this
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:35.480]  Kalea situation because everything else I've got I have like five articles that
[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:39.600]  are mainstream news saying World War three could start the next month as Saudi
[1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:43.240]  Arabia NATO and others prepare to send in massive ground trips to fight Russians
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:51.280]  this has entered just insane levels insane levels and it's because the
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:54.440]  establishment has decided to go for broke and so they're gonna start killing
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:58.920]  their enemies they're going to false flag they're going to pull all sorts of
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:03.120]  stuff and this is the time that I've talked to the military and others you
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:09.160]  guys claim that when they really try to get physical and take over that a lot of
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:13.600]  you are going to expose what's happening and that when push comes to shove
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:21.120]  you're being asked to openly go out and take out large political swaths of the
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:25.960]  resistance that you are going to disregard those illegal orders and do
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:33.000]  your duty and I'm not somebody that quite frankly shoots my mouth off about
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:39.840]  physical force and things like that and I am a person that is engaged in the
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:43.560]  information war but I don't say that I believe the information war is stronger
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:46.840]  because I don't want to shoot my mouth off about physical stuff and be a target
[1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:52.360]  I'm a bigger target because I'm not calling for violence as soon as Malcolm
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:57.080]  X stopped being racist and I get why he was racist because he'd been persecuted
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:01.720]  but as soon as he transcended that and started calling for peace and unity that
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:08.400]  killed him same thing with Martin Luther King who was never a racist and they
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:11.400]  don't want us coming together it's why I went met with Lewis Farrakhan he's not
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:15.000]  perfect nobody's perfect I'm not lionizing him either but he doesn't
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:19.200]  want a race war and they have him say I've grown we don't need this this isn't
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:22.960]  the way to fix it the eugenicists are attacking us all let's come together and
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:27.040]  deal with that but let's also try to realize that a lot of folks haven't been
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:30.720]  given some of this dirt and they need some of it and that doesn't mean giving
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:36.880]  them welfare it means giving people a shot I understand that but but people
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:39.360]  need to understand the point we're at in history is over the top Wayne
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:42.480]  Madison Lee with us about 15 minutes the next hour investigative journalist
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:45.760]  Wayne Madison report.com formal the National Security Agency we're going to
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:49.120]  have about five minutes Paul Watson's hosted the fourth hour today but he's
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:54.160]  gonna be joining me at the bottom of the next hour with bombshell research into
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:36:00.360]  that's a Democrat run County Democrat judge Democrat hotel Scalia each
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:04.320]  dinner with the guy Scalia gets up says he's tired goes to bed the guy says he
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:08.160]  has a bad feeling in the morning goes into his room of the Supreme Court
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:13.880]  Justice and he's dead and the guy's a black cop commando with all sorts of
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:19.440]  clandestine connections and then he makes statements like we found a pillow on
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:24.080]  his face I mean this is a message to those that can think that's how I
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:32.200]  interpret it that's the prime vein of Intel that's what the intellect in all
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:35.480]  the old police departments they had the guys that they said oh we don't know
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:38.760]  why this detective bust all these cases and seems to know where to look but he's
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:43.720]  got the nose it's not a nose it's you've got so much data so much info so much
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:47.840]  understanding of different criminal groups that you learn the signs and
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:52.000]  patterns in people and then as you study more and more knowledge it becomes
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.440]  like you're them and you just know how they're operating and then when you see
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:01.440]  these statements I gotta just tell you this looks like a giant threat to
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:05.560]  everybody and it's meant to be double-edged it's very sophisticated for
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:10.720]  anybody that's actually understands how things works it's a total threat
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:15.280]  everybody better get in line or you're next and for the general public it's
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:23.680]  just mindless confusion on purpose fog of war where they will do operations and
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:27.040]  just do a bunch of weird confusing things in the midst of it that witnesses
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:31.960]  seeing things that then just gets added to it so you don't know what you saw it
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:35.240]  be like drugging a woman and then dressing up and you know an Easter Bunny
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:38.720]  outfit while you did it and you know running around in circles so later they
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:41.760]  tell the cops that they sound like a schizophrenic that that's basic that's
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:45.720]  from was from declassified CIA mind control stuff where they would get kids
[1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:49.240]  and do things far worse and just so whack them out and so screw with them
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:53.480]  that what they said later was so crazy the police wouldn't believe them and so
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:57.560]  that's basically what I see they're doing here I mean this this is this is
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:04.120]  unbelievable enemy signature I mean it is in fuego how obvious it is giant red
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:10.040]  flashing light red flags going off balloons going off alarms going off this
[1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:15.960]  is a message the the head of Russian intelligence at 54 drop dead and the
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:19.120]  Russians come out and say we're preparing for war war three we're under attack
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:22.920]  there's infiltrators they search I mean that was a close they kill folks they
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:27.320]  killed the head of Russian intelligence that's what I'm telling you folks they're
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:31.520]  not they took the gloves off and they're going for broke on every front and I
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.640]  just want to ask the people in the Pentagon the FBI and everybody else are
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:40.280]  you really going to go along with this we're going to Wayne Madsen in a moment
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:44.080]  going back to the point we're trying to make we have the article here about
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:48.960]  little the head of the Justice Department Justice Ginsburg details death
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:54.560]  threat death in office a rarity for modern Supreme Court justices I would not
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:59.240]  like to be replaced by someone who would undo everything I did and then it goes
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:03.480]  in to say that Loretta wrench is the most likely candidate according to the
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:08.320]  White House Senate Dems pass resolution against election year appointments but
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:12.240]  now they're demanding it and Curt Nemo's article at info wars.com is so key
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:18.080]  Obama may use nuclear option to appoint a Supreme Court Justice Obama's past
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:21.640]  constitutional violations paved the way for liberal domination of the highest
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:25.360]  court that's right they're preparing to just a point and bypass Congress never
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:31.440]  before done but you never saw people win six coin tosses in a row to win Iowa you
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:35.920]  never saw folks lose by 20 points and get the super delegates and win this is
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:39.640]  this this is the season you never saw him go on the news and say the word
[1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:44.360]  mother and father is bad you never saw him say founding fathers bad you never
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:47.560]  saw him deliver armored vehicles ever police department and announced that
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.200]  war with the veterans and gun owners is about to come well of course it's about
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:54.320]  to come they're not gonna give us a choice they're gonna start killing
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:59.880]  everybody I've been warned you about this for a long time if Ron Paul suddenly
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:03.320]  falls off his bike and hits his head and then Matt drugs dies in a car wreck and
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:07.080]  Alex Jones gets arrested you know dead with a hooker with a heroin needle in
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:11.840]  his arm I don't do that and I don't take drugs I'm telling you folks this is a
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:17.100]  takeover and every other indicator shows it we expected something like this we
[1:40:17.100 --> 1:40:21.720]  warned you and now get ready for hell to be released because if they killed him
[1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:26.400]  and maybe she won six coin causes in a row and maybe he died of natural causes
[1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:29.120]  and they came out and told us he had a pillow on his face and then we're not
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:35.600]  having an autopsy and all this bull maybe then maybe then everything's okay and
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:38.840]  two plus two does equal five Joe Biggs I'm Randy you got about three minutes
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:41.240]  we're gonna play the heart attack done piece and get some final comments from
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:45.200]  Kit Daniels this death or murder has huge implications for the future of
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:50.720]  America like I said if they appoint Loretta Lynch as his predecessor they
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:55.240]  bring him or bring her in now we have to look at who it is that she actually
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:41:00.240]  supports is she more on Bernie's side or Hillary side I guarantee you if they
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:04.960]  put her in it's gonna be a Democrat that wins I think that's gonna be something
[1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:07.560]  that's gonna happen right there if they bring him someone like that and
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:10.640]  Obama doesn't wait for the next president to make that decision they're
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:14.960]  gonna force that in they're able to kill Scalia and steal the Supreme Court they
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:19.280]  will just basically steal the election it won't matter yeah it's going to go
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:22.200]  that way I believe well remember what Larry Nichols kept saying I hope he's
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:25.400]  not too sick to come on have you guys called him yet because he's literally
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:29.600]  fighting for his life right now he said get ready people start dying as a
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:35.240]  message to DC did not go after Hillary and I guarantee a Nichols I mean if you
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:38.280]  watch Republican debate on Saturday night I mean Trump was in a stacked
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:42.000]  crowd against him they were literally trying to mob this man even though he
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.280]  won the polls everyone who watched that debate saw that he came out he stood his
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:49.760]  ground against George Bush he or against the Bush family he stood his ground
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:54.520]  about 9-11 and he was booed and booed they bought out that entire crowd to make
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:59.640]  him look back but he's still won the polls but just for a sheet someone
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:02.920]  viewing that would go oh my god maybe this guy's bad you know they're trying
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:07.120]  to demonize him while doing all of this stuff as well with Loretta a
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:11.200]  Loretta wrench bringing in you know all this stuff I mean it's crazy what's
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:16.520]  gonna happen I'm telling you 2016 could be the the year that it's you know we
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:22.200]  know I agree we know that political assassinations have been just ubiquitous
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:25.000]  throughout history it's a fact and the fact that they now act like it's even
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.760]  weird to ask for an autopsy look at this crazy Alex Jones he says look out if
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:32.880]  they don't do an autopsy within an hour and a half of being announced I go if
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:36.080]  there's not an autopsy folks look out the fact that they already announced this
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:40.080]  and said if Pierce to be natural causes this stinks this is a super powerful
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:43.320]  public figure key decision-maker even more important than the president right
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:47.240]  now he's dead and it's all these different stories heart attack wasn't a
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.920]  heart attack and they have hundreds of articles saying I'm a crazy cook and
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:57.000]  dangerous and nuts so I mean it doesn't get more obvious than this I want to
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:00.840]  play this heart attack gun piece where they fire this little ice crystal into
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:04.640]  your heart it's probably on a point blank range and they just come up boom
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:08.800]  shoot it between the ribs it goes into the heart it's a tiny hole but cause you
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:11.000]  to bleed out and then of course you don't want an autopsy to show that
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:14.320]  happened but that's not how I would do it and generally if you got somebody like
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:16.400]  this one of their favorite ways is with a pillow
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:21.240]  excruciation it's very hard to prove how it happened and you just go in and have
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:25.560]  boom you go in and three people lay a crossing you put the pillow over his face
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:28.200]  I mean he could have been poisoned three minutes he could have been poisoned as well
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:31.040]  he said he was feeling tired all the sudden he left the party early and went
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:34.480]  well they can also drug you in this and then and then so there's not a struggle
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:37.400]  they could have they are in the power so they like to do a dignified with somebody
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:40.320]  like him so there's a chance yeah that he was drugged and then drugged a dinner
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:43.440]  and then killed and we have to do the speculation the like like it's horrible
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:48.240]  we're doing it because there's no police this is a Democrat run county known for
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:52.560]  all the narcotics trafficking probably the most corrupt counties in America and
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:55.560]  so we have to sit here and point all this out I'm sorry it's a fact he's an
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:58.840]  important man and the person who's gonna replace him is gonna have a huge effect
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:02.040]  on our country that's right Joe Banks continue reporting great job let's go to
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:06.180]  this clip right now of the ice gun then we're going to get a comment from Kit
[1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:09.320]  Daniels and we're gonna go to our guest here I appreciate joining us on short
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:13.560]  notice in fours reporter Wayne Madsen and I don't know his take on this yet
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:16.840]  we're about to find out that's how I do it I just respect his opinion and his
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:20.640]  analysis will go to him but here is the piece on the heart attack gun from the
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:25.240]  church hearings that Joe Biggs pointed out here this so I had to find one time
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:31.000]  they wanted me to find to find out if there was such a thing as as a poison
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:36.760]  that was undetectable especially one that seemed to mimic a heart attack that
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:40.800]  would kill someone but it would appear that they had a heart attack I did find
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:46.400]  such a thing does this pistol fire the dart yes it does
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:51.800]  chairman and a special one was developed which potentially would be able to
[1:44:51.800 --> 1:44:57.640]  enter the target without perception the poison was frozen into some sort of
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:04.600]  dart and then it was shot at very high speed into the person so at when it
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:08.680]  reached the person it would melt inside them and the only thing would be like
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:13.280]  one little tiny red dot on their body which is hard to detect there wouldn't
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:16.240]  be a needle left or anything like that yeah they also shoot it in the front
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:21.760]  alone so the toxin itself would not appear in the autopsy yes so that there
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:27.000]  was no no way of perceiving that the target was him have you brought with
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:34.080]  you some of those devices which would have enabled the CIA to use this poison
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:42.840]  for we have indeed for killing people the round thing at the top is obviously the
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:51.120]  site in the hands of these guys on stage were killed for this self when it
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:59.600]  strikes the sun target does the target know that he's about he's been hit and
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:05.800]  about that a special one was developed which potentially would be able to enter
[1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:10.120]  the target without perception all right that's the murdering director let's stop
[1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:16.280]  right there that full video is up on info wars.com but oh even saying they
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:22.880]  could assassinate people is wrong is bad is insane is crazy my dad who's well
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:28.040]  researched pointed out that what he thought which means he heard from people
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:33.160]  he knows made Hosni Mubarak suddenly become a vegetable for a while is they've
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:38.000]  got high-powered ultrasound paddles that they just put on your carotid arteries
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:41.960]  that break loose all the buildup and cause strokes and they just sit there and
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:47.280]  do it when you're drugged until they have you hooked up to an EKG you see a
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:54.680]  stroke started and you just stop and it's a stroke so loving but we shouldn't
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:47:00.480]  talk about all this should we I mean again I have had family and I don't know
[1:47:00.480 --> 1:47:03.040]  the details because I wasn't told I was told by one of these people you're lucky
[1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:07.980]  you're not dead when he read my book who was an army officer and then was
[1:47:07.980 --> 1:47:13.040]  recruited into CIA death squads in America so folks just need to grow up
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:17.240]  and stop being ignorant about all this now let's go to Kit Daniels then we're
[1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:21.280]  going to Wayne Madsen Kit briefly final points on what you're bringing up
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:24.880]  early Scalia trying to lead a movement to at least preserve some parts of
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:28.960]  Constitution wasn't perfect this looks like perfect timing yes Scalia was the
[1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:32.080]  ideal candidate for a political assassination because he was going around
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.520]  to law schools across the country and giving standing room only speeches on
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:41.760]  encouraging law students to become the next generation of constitutionalists
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:45.920]  now that reminds me a lot of Ron Paul Scalia's about the only one other
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:49.920]  person besides Ron Paul a few others that was doing just that and this is the
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:53.080]  guy I was the lone man on the Supreme Court that was going to stand up against
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:58.080]  Obama's executive actions on gun control amnesty he was expected to vote no on
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:01.800]  the upcoming case on immigration I think in carbon taxes he was going to defeat
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:07.040]  the whole agenda yeah and now he drove in to a black op commanders hotel in the
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:11.600]  middle of nowhere in a Democrat run corrupt County and had shot there at
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:15.520]  the table with the black op commander who found him debbed the pillow over his
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:19.800]  face but they'll be no investigation yeah exactly and it's really for final
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:24.280]  comments really interesting note that I think in 2003 he reclused himself from
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:28.280]  a Supreme Court case where an atheist was suing a school district because his
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:32.000]  daughter had to do the Pledge of Allegiance you know one nation under
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:37.360]  God because Scalia public in a public speech before that he talked about how
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:41.960]  all the courts in the country were using the establishment clause to attack
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:45.600]  Christianity and they were just completely abusing and he said that's not
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:49.560]  what the founder founding fathers intended with the establishment clause so
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:53.920]  this is a Reagan ideologist that was the lone man that was standing between
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:59.520]  Obama in his war on not only Christianity but the Constitution itself
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:02.920]  absolutely do you agree with me this signifies they're dropping the hammer a
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:06.480]  whole new level oh absolutely to me as Scalia was kind of like the mad rudge of
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:11.880]  the Supreme Court I mean he kind of had that influence as far as not only being
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:15.240]  an ideologist who stood up for the Constitution and conservatism in general
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:19.760]  but also encouraging an audience of millions of people to do the same thing
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:23.360]  yeah I don't usually sit here and you know try to communicate with drugs I
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:27.040]  could call him or I could you know email him but I leave him alone you know we're
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:31.760]  we're both busy and drudge is really smart but I'm probably trying to call him
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:35.280]  today and I never do that and I'm gonna call a bunch of other people too and
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:38.600]  really think what the best thinking is on this but I it's probably time for him
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:42.960]  to make a statement other people because if we this is a test I mean if we don't
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.520]  come out and say we want a criminal investigation when independent stuff this
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:51.200]  is dangerous then more people are gonna start dying and or we can just escape
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:55.280]  the country and wait for him to hunt us down overseas I mean if it walks like a
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:59.640]  duck quacks like a duck swims like a duck it is a duck and it's just horrible
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:02.240]  get Daniels thank you for your great analysis and great work and you're
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:04.880]  trying to write an article on this I drug you in here so thank you for joining
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:08.840]  us I appreciate Alex I'm skipping another network break I'm just too intense
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:11.840]  here I just have too much to cover and I want to go to Wayne Matz and I
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:14.720]  appreciate him holding the last 15 minutes while I talk to those two
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:22.960]  reporters Wayne my head is spinning right now I mean I don't know which angle to
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:26.800]  hit this from I mean I really respect your view I know you're right for him
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:31.720]  for worse.com but I did not visit Wayne Matz report.com I just thought of you
[1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:36.040]  this morning and said let's get Wayne on and and see what he thinks so Wayne I
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:39.200]  don't know if you mesh with our concerns or if you augment them or you
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:45.320]  disagree but what are you thinking is happening? Well you know at the very
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:51.520]  least here we have another death of a high-ranking federal official in the
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:51:00.000]  state of Texas and no Texas autopsy what happened you know from 1963 where the
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:05.520]  local medical examiner in Dallas said President Kennedy's body cannot leave
[1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:11.200]  the state of Texas until an autopsy is performed here there was a botched one
[1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:15.240]  conducted later at Bethesda by the fed and the brain disappeared and the brain
[1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:21.280]  disappeared yeah but so where have we gone in the last 53 years since that
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:27.360]  because why was it important to keep President Kennedy in in Texas for an
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:34.400]  autopsy but it wasn't important to keep Celia in Texas for an autopsy and you
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:40.360]  know I know the family said they didn't want one done but there was he's
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:46.800]  suspicious circumstances obviously who is this John our point dexter he's not
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:51.920]  the one from Iran Contra people have made that mistake that's retired Admiral
[1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:58.960]  John in point dexter but who is this guy apparently Celia did not have a past
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:05.760]  close relationship with him it's not like where Celia and Cheney both went to
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:12.440]  that other ranch the hunt quail where Cheney shot his lawyer a few years ago
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:18.440]  so there are some but the sure way to create questions is to not conduct an
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:24.280]  autopsy now the Democrats who say they you know good riddance to Celia I would
[1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:31.760]  point out not only was there one icon involved in this situation in Texas
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:38.840]  with no a state autopsy being performed but two other Democratic icons died
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:44.680]  suddenly and again no autopsy was performed Franklin Delano Roosevelt the
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:49.860]  president of the United States died in Warm Springs Georgia in 19th for April
[1:52:49.860 --> 1:52:57.160]  1945 and can you imagine the president had no autopsy performed on him the word
[1:52:57.160 --> 1:53:00.880]  is they they they killed him and of course we also have Woodrow Wilson not a
[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:05.120]  good guy but yeah he got he wrote a letter saying I'm gonna oppose all this
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:09.960]  globalism I got con and the word is he got poisoned yeah and I would also point
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:15.680]  at that Adlai Stevenson the Democratic candidate for president twice in the
[1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:22.400]  1950s dropped edit they said of a massive artifact in London they had just
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:26.600]  met with the Prime Minister Aaron Wilson yet because two governments were
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:31.840]  involved Britain and the United States there's some question about that autopsy
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:36.240]  as well let me ask you a question we got Princess Diana and then it came out
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:39.180]  they murdered her even the autopsy and then they had a Kings Commission or
[1:53:39.180 --> 1:53:42.960]  Queens Commission say it wasn't you know formally even in the NSA you've you've
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:46.200]  been in the on the naval intelligence area you've been in all these different
[1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:50.520]  facets you've reported on national security for 30 years you're one of the
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:54.800]  first big NSA whistleblowers so knowing I inside baseball works either they
[1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:58.600]  screwed up so bad he died naturally and they did everything perfectly to make it
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:04.960]  look like he was killed just magically this happened or they killed him but
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:08.960]  want everybody to then know they killed him we found a pillow on his face we
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:12.960]  came in two hours after breakfast and had a bad feeling I mean it's just it's
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:17.080]  made to look like they killed him yeah I mean is that a threat to the other
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:21.640]  Supreme Court people well I'd like to know where the US Marshall service was
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:26.800]  now that he didn't want his security he just magically went down to this
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:30.760]  narcotics you know corrupt Democrat run area on the border and then he just
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:35.280]  magically you know I'm sorry go ahead right but the US Marshall service is like
[1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:43.160]  the secret service for the president exactly yeah and I mean he has
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:47.760]  Marshall protection when he's in Washington and why did it last when we
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:54.720]  went down to this ranch in Texas they did quote the Marshall service saying
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:55:00.080]  they had it initially investigated his death along with the FBI and concluded
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.640]  that there was no foul play now that wasn't the initial report why would they
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:11.840]  even say anything about foul play exactly because you know especially with
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:14.320]  no autopsy let's be clear let's be clear they
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:20.040]  helicoptered in a federal Marshall about five hours after he was found dead and
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:22.880]  within 30 minutes I've got the timeline we're doing a story on it because we
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:28.880]  were yeah they call a TV station to make the announcement but Obama was told two
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:34.360]  hours before so an anonymous federal Marshall said yeah it's not foul play
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:39.200]  which is totally suspicious it's natural no autopsy needed because he's now a
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.960]  corner right right exactly and that and if you want to start it's like every
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:50.840]  other situation if you want to start a raft of conspiracy theories don't do an
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:55.720]  autopsy so you know if they're complaining now about all these theories
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:59.920]  being bandied about it's their fault they should have cleared it up immediately
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:02.880]  and that's not to say that you can believe in autopsy either you know it
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:09.320]  depends on who performs it and in this case because family Malik and the
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:14.760]  Clintons and yeah and you know that this particular county and and you but you
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:19.120]  will you've got basically a justice of the piece that's determining what to
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:26.640]  cause this woman doing brain surgery yeah I mean so they got this justice
[1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:31.240]  these things her first name is Cinderella it's like a fairy tale just like
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:36.440]  Cinderella so yeah there's what do you what do people like what about the
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:40.240]  changing of the story Wayne I mean you know yeah natural causes heart attack
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:46.120]  well you're a doctor well it wasn't heart attack yeah I mean not all that
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:49.440]  would have been thought by professionals being present and that would
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:53.040]  have been certified and that's what everyone does you call the police the
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.120]  cops know their job an ambulance takes them into a medical examiner to decide
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:03.040]  whether there's gonna be an autopsy they default ignored all the default systems
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:07.960]  the law right and and these ranches seem to when people that there's an
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:11.640]  incident one of these quail hunting ranches down I remember they would tell
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:16.360]  Cheney shooting his lawyer for like all overnight we didn't know about it so late
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:19.560]  in the next yeah there's a lot of stuff going on on the ranches stay there Wayne

[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:23.600]  careful what you wish all you Democrats calling for murdering conservatives
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:29.000]  and having a tyrannical takeover the republicans trying to give Obama
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:32.520]  dictatorial power martial law power so they have it when they get in office
[2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:38.160]  careful what you wish you just might get it Wayne Madsen's our guest so I
[2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:42.440]  didn't know the law degree you also got a medical examiner and coroner's degree
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:49.800]  which is an MD medical license but now I mean normally folks would pass the buck
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:53.040]  and say we don't know why I died might be natural there'll be a coroner's deal
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:57.280]  medical examiner will decide no they were like natural causes immediately
[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:00.600]  everything's fine go to sleep everything's wonderful here is the clip
[2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:06.760]  Texas judge Scalia died of natural causes top elected official that's a
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:10.080]  medical degree in the in fact if I ever need any surgery I'll just go to the
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:14.760]  mayor and ask for it top elected official in the county where Anthony
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:18.440]  Scalia was found dead says the US Supreme Court justice died of natural
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:22.560]  causes a heart attack and they changed to Texas funeral home manager says
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:25.960]  Scalia's body has been taken to an airport will be flown to Virginia let's
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:31.560]  go to that clip since there were no signs of foul play then no autopsy was
[2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:37.600]  ordered my only concern was to make sure that everything was done right and I
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:44.000]  did done right so she said I did my own investigation which included talking to
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:49.400]  his physician and after talking to his physician and from what I was told from
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:54.800]  the US Marshal and the sheriff that was there with no signs of signs of
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:02:03.720]  foul play that in fact this was in all probability in actual death okay in all
[2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:10.240]  probability great autopsy investigation but no no no no no no we didn't have a
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:14.080]  security detail he's dead could it be he died naturally but they should have been
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:19.640]  there so now they don't want to debate it Wayne Madsen yeah I mean this this is
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:24.080]  what why there's gonna be questions raised because you know it was so he's
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:29.080]  taken to a funeral home was he involved at the funeral home that means even if
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:34.000]  they decide later to do a post mortem there's gonna be a lot of clues that
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:40.600]  are gonna not be discovered so I mean the thing is there's more chain of
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:45.480]  custody on a bag of pot that caught by the police and somebody who's down by
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:49.320]  the place of somebody's car than there was on an associate justice of the
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:54.640]  Supreme Court that it's you know there's one custody with a bag you check at the
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.880]  airport than this exactly so you know these are these are the questions are
[2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:05.040]  gonna be raised as they're raised in every case where there's a situation
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:13.720]  where non-professionals and certainly this judge down in on the border you
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:17.880]  heard her she did an investigation in the medical stuff I mean yeah and and she
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:23.520]  said in all probability that's not a doesn't sound like a hard and fast that's
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:26.680]  why you have laws about medical examiners because you we don't go off what
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:32.280]  you think lady that's right and I've I've investigated enough deaths over the
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:40.200]  years to know that the medical examiners and my god funeral home directors who
[2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:46.000]  sometimes have a double duty as a county medical examiner these are not
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.280]  the people that are qualified to conduct these post mortems so you know
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:56.360]  there there will be questions raised as they're always let me ask this I don't
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:03:58.760]  want to put you on a limb as your eternalist but what does your gut tell
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:02.560]  you I mean the instant reporting the instant attempt to bury him the instant
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:06.800]  attempt to criticize anybody that asks questions does this not stink well my
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:11.560]  my gut when I first heard the report last night or yesterday afternoon was
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:18.280]  that you know 79 years old overweight maybe not the best of health okay but
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:22.760]  not what the you know the lack of an autopsy and this thing even the
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:29.440]  Washington Post welled on the pillow on his head and when the post does that you
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:33.120]  got to say wait a minute you know because the post has always been in the
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:38.720]  position of covering things up for you know for decades now and so yeah that
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:43.920]  raises a lot of questions so I'm I'm I'm suspicious my Wayne stay there I want
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:47.080]  to come back and get other angles on this place mother clips and then some
[2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:50.760]  other news with you then Paul Watson is joining us I'll also open the phones up
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.480]  so folks can give us their take on what's happening here maybe Hillary did
[2:04:54.480 --> 2:04:58.880]  win six coin tosses in a row maybe she did lose New Hampshire but still won was
[2:04:58.880 --> 2:05:02.600]  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia assassinated there's growing evidence
[2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:06.560]  suggesting that yes he was Scalia who once said he interpreted the bill arise
[2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:09.560]  no different than the founding fathers was found dead in his room while staying
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:12.840]  at a ranch owned by a Democratic donor in the remote Big Bend region of West
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:16.320]  Texas for one thing for studio County Judge Sotaro Gabbana first claimed the
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:19.480]  Scalia died of heart attack and then she later backed off that statement and
[2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:23.600]  claimed instead that he died of natural causes with no signs of outplay but she
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:27.120]  never saw the body in fact the Supreme Court Justice was found with a pillow
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:31.160]  over his head not only was there no autopsy performed on Scalia but his body
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:34.720]  was also rushed to a funeral home to be quickly involved a process which would
[2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:38.000]  destroy toxicology evidence indicating whether he had been poisoned the arch
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.880]  conservatives Scalia also posed many of Obama's policies on illegal immigration
[2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:45.600]  in gun control and Obama benefits from his death by now being able to point his
[2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:48.440]  own judge who will undoubtedly rubber-stamp the president's war on the

[2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:14.600]  organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:20.320]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in

[2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:17.240]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:23.000]  walking Obamacare attempting to repeal it trying to block the open boards trying
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.600]  to block the gun trying to block the carbon tax is about to hear them all
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:32.760]  and shoot them down and he's dead after he didn't bring a security detail to a
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:39.240]  Democrat run ranch in the middle of nowhere in southwest Texas it's been
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.120]  called even by Democrat operatives like Axelrod a seismic shift the biggest
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:52.800]  development in the 2016 election and as Wayne Madsen investigative
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:58.600]  journalist for info wars calm and Wayne Madsen report calm pointed out with
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:02.400]  people like Roosevelt people like Kennedy you name it they have botched or
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:07.480]  don't have these autopsies and I said Saturday night they're saying no foul
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:11.520]  play evidence that's totally creepy the first announcement from an anonymous
[2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:18.520]  law enforcement caller to a TV station didn't want their name on that just
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:23.040]  incredible and then we're not supposed to ask any questions and then they say
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:26.520]  it's a heart attack well how do you know well we don't it wasn't a heart
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:32.960]  attack this is absolutely over the top and then on info wars calm and YouTube
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:36.760]  and and on news articles I was reading the comments Democrats going I spit on
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:40.840]  his grave more conservatives need to die blah blah blah you know Scalia wasn't
[2:09:40.840 --> 2:09:46.320]  perfect by a long shot but compared to Kagan or something you're or or Lynch at
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:50.720]  the Attorney General's office who just is about as American as Mao Zedong I
[2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:59.280]  mean he was an angel compared to these people so we are in so much trouble right
[2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:04.840]  now and I hope they didn't kill him I mean it looks like a classic cover-up
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:10.640]  it's like a movie this is so ridiculous but for the general public if it is a
[2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:14.160]  murder it's just meant to just dumb you down but for those in the know it's a
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:19.160]  big open threat but David Knight co-host of this show get ready for nightly news
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:23.200]  tonight he was talking to me during the break I suppose just get on camera here
[2:10:23.200 --> 2:10:26.720]  before we go back to Wayne Madsen and give us your take and the different
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:29.800]  angles on the situation I mean what did you think David I know you like to be a
[2:10:29.800 --> 2:10:33.160]  journalist and go with what you can prove and where things go but you know
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:37.960]  it's like you Bernie Sanders plane blows up I mean statistically Hillary had
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:42.080]  him whacked I mean that's the first suspect it's like a convicted three-time
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:46.360]  child molester moves in on your street and your five-year-old disappears and
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:50.320]  his MO is grabbing five-year-olds the first thing you do you probably go over
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:53.600]  there and knock his door down you're so upset thing your kids probably in there
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:58.200]  you know maybe not the point is you're a prime suspect this corrupt system has
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:01.960]  been caught committing so many crimes murdering people saying they can kill
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:05.880]  citizens whenever they want of the president says so in DAA they're the
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:09.920]  suspects they're the prime suspects we'd be crazy not to do that but mainstream
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:14.400]  media they've got literally hundreds of articles bashing me and others saying we
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:20.160]  are insane to even want an autopsy so I guess this is the end of autopsies David
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:25.400]  night well you know Alex when I talked about this yesterday the person who did
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:30.320]  who said well we're not gonna have an autopsy Cinderella guavaro and I guess
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:33.360]  this is her Cinderella story first she says it's natural causes and she says
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:37.080]  it's a heart attack they put down a myocardial infarction which is a heart
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:41.160]  attack and then they change it back to natural causes and I saw the liberals
[2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:43.800]  who are pushing back on this I mentioned this yesterday you know you see these
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:49.880]  articles 3 2 1 conspiracy theory the guy is 79 years old it's time for him to
[2:11:49.880 --> 2:11:55.880]  die well these are the same people who are backing Bernie Sanders who is 75 if
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:00.600]  when he takes office he'll be 75 he's 74 now before the end of his first term
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:05.080]  he'll be the same age as Justice Scalia so there's a cognitive dissonance here
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:08.680]  on the people who say we shouldn't look at this closely and the very fact is you
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:13.480]  played this clip I played it yesterday of the church committee hearings 41 years
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:18.400]  ago the head of the CIA William Colby is talking about the ways that they have of
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:21.840]  killing people making it look like natural causes making it look like a
[2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:26.600]  heart attack this is something that they have been working on to perfect for
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:31.920]  decades they have an entire organization that's their entire purpose is to kill
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:36.680]  people covertly or overtly and when you I mean this is so widespread I have had
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:41.080]  family that was in this business yeah I mean and that's not even special like
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:45.880]  Texas is like the recruiting ground for the death squads I mean I just the
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:49.960]  naivete of the public they just have no idea and when I was doing the radio show
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:54.720]  the statements from the guy who owned the Cevolo ranch had not even come out
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:12:58.800]  yet the fact that he found him with a pillow over his head and that is and
[2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:03.120]  they acted like that credits me asking watch out if there's no autopsy watch
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:06.080]  out they came out and announced this right away that's standard and third
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:09.520]  world to say no foul play with no evidence you know this is so standard
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:13.440]  they use that to discredit us oh look even at Joan said this before the pillow
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:16.920]  go ahead well you know the other thing we need to be concerned about Alex of
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:22.960]  course last week the Supreme Court had put a stay on Obama and the EPA's orders
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:26.040]  that would essentially shut down the coal industry as Obama had promised so
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:29.240]  that's a key part of this and that's trillions in the next decade for the
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:33.520]  oil companies and it's one of the key ways that they're going to create a
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:36.880]  global governance like they've got three things they've got open borders they've
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:42.680]  got taking over our economy using climate control setting up a global tax
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:46.640]  regime and then taking over the economy and managing it from an international
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:51.440]  commission with these trade partnerships the TPP the TTIP so you've got three
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:55.760]  prongs heading towards the world government coming to completion in the
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.280]  next few years and not just here they're killing leaders overseas appointing
[2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:04.360]  presidents and prime ministers everywhere they are just accelerating like
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:07.280]  their lives are going to end if they don't have you seen all the mainstream
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:12.120]  articles about war with the US and Russia with US and Saudi Arabian troops
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:17.320]  getting ready to clash with Russians oh yeah and the neocons on TV saying attack
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:22.160]  Russia I mean these people are need to be stopped they're like Hitler you know
[2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:25.960]  after the Eastern front had already collapsed I mean the globalists are
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:29.560]  going to get everybody killed when you look at what Justice Kennedy is doing
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:33.040]  as well and we talk about this internationalism Justice Kennedy who
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:36.680]  was appointed by Ronald Reagan has been a leading proponent of using
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:41.480]  international law to alter our Constitution and so you know here's
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:44.720]  somebody that was appointed by Ronald Reagan just like Scalia was but he takes
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:48.880]  exactly the opposite approach the diametrically opposite approach to this
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:53.600]  and we look at the people that they're touting as being the leading possibilities
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:57.600]  besides Loretta Lynch they keep talking about this judge from India the guys got
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:02.200]  two Indian presidents he was born in India are we gonna have H1B justices
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:06.280]  for the Supreme Court somebody in America there's a constitution to get
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:09.120]  away with anything and everything God bless you David Knight great job thank
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:13.800]  you so much thank you it is such an insane time and I'm glad we've got David
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:17.240]  Knight and other crew here in case they arrest me or kill me I mean I'm
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:19.160]  actually I've gotten to that point I mean that's why I built a bigger
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:22.480]  operation brought crew in because I need like shark teeth if they take me out
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.360]  real leadership is having stuff prepared after you're gone this is about winning
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:29.480]  the war not about me folks I don't I don't mean that to be dramatic but I've
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:33.040]  been physically attacked death-threated you name it I think let me ask Wayne
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:37.120]  Madsen investigative journalist Wayne Madsen report calm Wayne I want to fund
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:42.160]  you and the crew to go down there and cover this you say you want to go if
[2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:45.560]  they try to act suspicious if they try to block you from being there I think
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:48.240]  that ratchets this up to pretty much certainty that they've been told to
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:52.040]  cover something about saying they're involved but but Wayne if this is foul
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:56.680]  play you know if Hillary cheated on the six coin toss that she won in a row you
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:03.320]  know if if the sky's blue if this is foul play then you know if the Clintons
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:10.840]  are murderers which is well known you know if if if the oceans wet then what
[2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:14.840]  does it signify that they've engaged in this assassination it's a very bold
[2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:18.480]  move and then why would they add all these conflicting statements in I mean
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:21.560]  that's just it's so amazing Wayne what do you think really bottom line is
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:28.040]  happening here well I would preface my statement you know there's only been
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:33.080]  three members of the Supreme Court who have died while sitting on the bench the
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:37.240]  last one was Chief Justice Rehnquist but he was sick he was in the hospital
[2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:41.320]  cancer on record price yeah that didn't surprise anyone and you have to go back
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:47.560]  to Associate Justice Binston decades ago to find the last one who died on the
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:53.480]  bench so here's the thing on on this four to four balance are talking about
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:58.080]  as David said you don't know which way Kennedy will go because he's when he
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:03.360]  swings both ways and I only mean that in a jurisprudence sense of the term but
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:09.160]  it could be it could be that we have a five to three court now with Kennedy
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:14.920]  swinging over to the the so-called liberal side but here's the here's the
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:24.320]  issue too if we see a suit against Ted Cruz's eligibility to run for the
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:30.560]  presidency come up through the federal appeals court to the Supreme Court the
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:37.480]  Supreme Court can either delay it until they get that ninth member or they can
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:44.080]  take it back down to the federal appeals court which means that whatever the
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:48.000]  appeals court rules will be that you know the law that's right they can defer
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:51.640]  and make the appeals court the new Supreme Court exactly and the word is
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:55.880]  it's only as a an original list they palm on the Constitution strict
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:18:03.080]  constructionist probably would have ruled against Cruz's eligibility because he
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:07.160]  would have seen in the Constitution look there's you know this he was born in
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:13.240]  Canada you know and it doesn't satisfy the definition of a natural born US
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:19.600]  citizen so there's a lot more at stake with this vacancy than some people may
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:23.040]  it's huge I mean I mean is this the biggest event in the 2016 election so
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:30.080]  far I would say it you know what it's one of those shocking news events like
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:35.200]  that you know obviously came up in the Republican debate the other evening and
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:40.560]  that was then I attend you actually I I attended the Trump rally which was held
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:47.160]  at the Sun Dome in Tampa and right before he came out to a standing room only
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:52.000]  16,000 people I understand it was the largest number of people they were
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:58.760]  packed into that arena at the University of South Florida but a Trump had said
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:05.400]  he was going to sue he was going to sue Cruz was that Cruz is an eligible he's
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:09.840]  a Canadian so we had Trump already say that he you know there may be a
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:16.520]  potential Supreme Court case here and then Scalia his size suddenly down in
[2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:22.400]  Texas I mean look look all the evidence leans towards foul play hanging
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:27.800]  pinky in my view and you add to all this the rest of the craziness Wayne it is
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:32.120]  just over-the-top insane I want to do one more segment with you just briefly

[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.200]  Syrian government yeah and and the UAE doesn't have much in a way of an army
[2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:58.640]  to have foreign mercenaries that are actually led by Eric Prince the former
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:03.320]  head of Blackwater there's so there's US special for former US special forces
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:07.280]  troops commanding these Colombians in South Africa let me be clear because you
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:11.800]  never go you're not half-cocked you're saying for former Blackwater XZ or

[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:48.280]  awful lot like R2P responsibility to protect the Hillary and Samantha Power
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:52.720]  and Susan Rice came up with they got us into this mess to begin with and here's
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:58.440]  the issue the US also had special forces in fighting for the Syrian Kurds and
[2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:04.360]  the Iraqi Kurds and we could have a situation where retired special forces
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:10.440]  working for Prince and the UAE government will be shooting at current
[2:29:10.440 --> 2:29:15.480]  special forces troops in Syria fighting on behalf of the Syrian Kurds against

[2:33:15.160 --> 2:33:18.400]  by the way I'm going back to Wayne Madison for about three minutes to the
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:21.640]  Paul Watson and he's gonna be hosting the fourth hour and I've got a bunch of
[2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:24.520]  other news I've got to get to as well and I haven't been taking a lot of calls
[2:33:24.520 --> 2:33:28.960]  lately maybe Paul do it in the fourth hour I should be I want to hear from you
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:33.080]  about Scalia it's just there's so many facets to this that my head is just
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:38.400]  spinning what does signifies I mean I've had so much energy since Saturday
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:42.960]  before since that morning I was up here working all Saturday on record doing
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:45.960]  videos saying something big is about to happen they're moving on every front I
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:50.520]  just feel like we should be fighting harder and then boom Scalia was already
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:56.920]  dead the world financial meltdown all of it but you know the crew points out to
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:00.960]  me I skip breaks constantly I don't plug things I'm not funding our operation
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:06.200]  listener wise we are as successful as it gets exponentially growing financially
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:09.800]  we're just bringing in the money we need to operate at current levels and I
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:13.320]  want to get a few more camera people a couple more reporters I don't want to
[2:34:13.320 --> 2:34:16.000]  sit there and obsess over where I send an investigative journalist like Wayne
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:20.320]  Madsen I didn't send anybody today but this year's I don't have the money people
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:23.120]  go oh you're a failure you're not you don't have a helicopter you know you

[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:16.640]  which we're planning to do with crew along with Richard Reeves but I'm glad
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:20.440]  you do want to go to South Texas and cover that but but we're done talking
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:23.400]  about that for now we'll obviously have you back in the next few days for an
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:27.520]  update as you research this but separately how would you say things are
[2:37:27.520 --> 2:37:33.040]  going for the Anglo-American power arm versus the Russian and Chinese power arm
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:39.600]  and what else are you watching what else do you expect to pop well I I mentioned
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:44.160]  earlier this situation with Ukraine allowing Turks to come into their
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:48.640]  country the Ukrainian government is a foreign Toros operated government
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:54.680]  anyway it's corrupt and we just had the first ever meeting between a patriarch of
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:58.800]  the Russian Orthodox Church and the pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church in
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:04.000]  Havana that never happened before and I'm sure what they discussed is if these
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:09.720]  two individuals come to an agreement and they they can they can basically tell
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:14.800]  both sides in the Ukraine situation back down get rid of that phony
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:18.440]  government and yeah that's right what does that signify for the first time in
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:24.200]  2000 years these two original churches you can argue who's older meet for the
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:29.640]  first time it's because it's saying is Europe gonna go to war with Russia
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:33.680]  that's who obviously the Pontiff represents and the EU effect I meant to
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:38.040]  cover that you were absolutely right elaborate on that sir that is so huge
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.200]  that shows us how close we are to World War 3 and these institutions realize
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:48.720]  this was this not really a meeting of Russia with the Vatican yeah basically
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:52.760]  that's what it was and and what we see now that the Russian Orthodox Church
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:58.960]  which really can speak for a number of other Orthodox churches in the area in
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:03.200]  the Middle East and in Georgia and Ukraine and elsewhere they're in a
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:07.240]  position now the Pope and the Patriarch that tell the Ukrainians look
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:13.560]  you're you're you're with us and if you want to keep playing with ISIS you're
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:17.400]  that government's not going to be around because if we put the word out to our
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:21.520]  people in Ukraine they're going to be dragging people like Yatsenyuk out and
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:26.000]  hanging so that shows how deadly this battle is this battle of five armies
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:29.760]  now that you see unprecedented what happens right the Wahhabist are talking
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:34.640]  about a new crusade and when you see the Pope and the Patriarch meet for the
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:38.120]  first time maybe they're saying okay you want to crusade you're gonna get your
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:43.400]  crusade and Erdogan keep supporting these guys these ISIS guys and he's made
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:49.120]  this concordant with the Wahhabist that runs Saudi Arabia if I were Erdogan I'd
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:53.520]  be looking at maintaining control over what was Constantinople and was the
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:58.720]  head that was the headquarters of the Orthodox of the Byzantine yeah the
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:03.360]  Greeks have wanted that holy church the Hagia Sophia back for ever and now
[2:40:03.360 --> 2:40:07.120]  Erdogan says he's going to turn it back into a working mosque I think we're on
[2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:15.200]  the verge of a major second crusade and and meanwhile Obama goes to his first
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:19.480]  mosque ever as president in Baltimore and it's a mosque affiliated with the Saudi
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:23.440]  Wahhabist that's what I want to say I've got electrical chills all over my body
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:27.600]  I've never had this in my life okay I mean I've had I've walked out of a thing
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:30.040]  in a mugger where the butcher knife came at me and I didn't have this much
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:36.720]  electricity in me I can feel the epic shifting it's so historical it's so
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:40.600]  beyond the next files episode I don't know how the average person isn't
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:43.960]  completely freaked out now now finish up with this point because I because I
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:47.200]  interrupted you earlier with another subject which you then went into the
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:51.960]  pope thank God Wayne I mean your own show for an hour a day here on info
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:56.440]  waters I mean just so you're not interrupted looking at this what does it
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:01.240]  signify that princes new group and I actually have seen that I'd forgotten to
[2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:05.760]  cover it is involved different parts of the Middle East it loggerheads with
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:10.560]  other factions in our government actually fighting ISIS and also in Ukraine
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:16.640]  to end up having mercenaries formerly from the US and taken from the US
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:21.400]  battling US troops I mean are they that dishonorable that they'll actually do
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:25.320]  that or is there a level that these mercenaries or Eric Prince might actually
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:31.760]  stop their behavior at under John Glenn and the CIA has become an active ally
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:38.080]  of ISIS the Saudis and the Turks he's a he's a Saudi file he's the word is he
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:41.080]  converted he converted Islam I mean that's pretty much yeah and I I can
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:46.440]  almost believe that so here we have his you know and look it was Prince was
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:51.040]  tied up with the CIA when he was running Blackwater and they were and
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:55.600]  Brennan was one of the architects of the torture and rendition program that
[2:41:55.600 --> 2:42:00.000]  Blackwater was independently involved in so here we have the special active
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:04.120]  special forces still under the control of Pentagon possibly getting into a
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:10.120]  ground war in Syria with these are these are two people coming in from
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:13.360]  I'll tell you Prince is one arrogant person we think she's gonna get away
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:19.840]  with that absolutely and he's also affiliated with the office stay
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:25.960]  movement so you know I said this is a little bit of Tom Clancy Dan Brown
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:30.840]  DaVinci code and you mentioned ex files throw it all in together and that's
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:35.520]  what you got right here just big mess Wayne incredible analysis please join
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:38.720]  us on the nightly news tonight if you can thank you so much for amazing
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:45.480]  reported sir you bet Alex I can officially say this is the most concerned
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:50.760]  and awake and also electrified and empowered I've ever been I mean I I
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:54.360]  kept saying we're crossing the threshold we're entering the world
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:58.640]  government we're entering the great battle for human future we're now not
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:04.240]  just crossing the threshold we're entering it I mean the whole future is
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:07.760]  being decided folks when the globalists get full control they're coming after
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:12.560]  your family your pension funds your farm your ranch they don't just want to own
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:18.840]  you they want to kill you and then it is Islamic the globalists are satanic they
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:24.160]  have joined with radical Islam radical Islam has taken over Islam and
[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:28.960]  Christianity is deciding right now whether to die and submit to this or to
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:32.600]  fight and I think that's why the patriarch met with the Pope I mean this
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:40.400]  is unprecedented to have a pope step down and a new pope come in Paul Joseph
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:43.920]  Watson joins us from London England to break down his view on what happened with
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:47.640]  Scalia's death and just incredible connections his article and video is up
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:53.040]  on info wars calm title why people are questioning Scalia's death I mean why
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:56.840]  shouldn't there be questioning that's normal in this climate the powerful
[2:43:56.840 --> 2:44:00.960]  person dies and they instantly say move along but but Paul just geopolitically
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:04.640]  everything that's happening do you intellectually see it and in your gut do
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:08.840]  you not feel it that that that we are going over the edge of the roller coaster
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:16.240]  right now no you've got 350 Saudi Arabian troops basically preparing to invade
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:21.600]  Syria their their friends ISIS didn't do a good enough job apparently that's all
[2:44:21.600 --> 2:44:25.600]  about to kick off they're talking about the biggest war games involving Saudi
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:31.320]  Arabia ever that they've ever staged in their entire military history so they're
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:35.240]  preparing to invade it could cause a confrontation with Russia you've got
[2:44:35.240 --> 2:44:40.440]  Medvedev warning of a new Cold War talking about World War three so you
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:44.760]  know that old Chinese proverb may we live in interesting times now has never
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:49.120]  been more interesting in terms of global flashpoints world governments being
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:55.200]  announced our credibility those that question are exploding I think this is
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:44:57.960]  all out of control geopolitically what do you think's really going on right now
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:45:04.000]  Paul well I mean they failed in Syria they tried to carve it up now Turkey's
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:08.480]  getting involved as well because the Kurds are basically kicking the butts of
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.800]  the jihadists in Aleppo that Turkey and Saudi Arabia funded so they're not happy
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:18.200]  with the outcome of course we know that the Pentagon foresaw the rise of ISIS
[2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:22.320]  that's why they helped helped it spread throughout the region the Salafist
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:26.600]  principality in their own documents that came out six months ago so they
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:29.600]  basically tried to spread these jihadists around the world as they did
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:34.960]  before in Libya to create this this pretext for carving up the country it's
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:40.000]  failed and now we could see an even bigger bigger conflict and now the CIA
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:44.920]  director acting director comes in and says brace for inevitable ISIS attacks
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:50.160]  in America and that's why we should invade Syria because it's a Saud's fault
[2:45:50.160 --> 2:45:54.840]  thinking we don't know that he and others helped launch this attack and that he
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:46:00.280]  himself is a Saudi Arabian Wahhabist pledged and we actually have a Wahhabist
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:03.640]  running the CIA it's over the country's dummy I mean I just can't handle it
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:07.360]  anymore I can't handle it anymore I'm sorry Paul I just can't sit here and
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:11.800]  calmly talk about this anymore I can't even look at his face go ahead well I
[2:46:11.800 --> 2:46:17.520]  mean you remember back in 2012 it was a conspiracy theory that Al Qaeda or any
[2:46:17.520 --> 2:46:22.400]  jihadists whatsoever were even involved in Syria that was the level of delusion
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:26.640]  they were trying to place people under as little as three and a half years ago
[2:46:26.640 --> 2:46:30.440]  we pointed it out that the council on foreign relations would were pointing
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:34.400]  out in their own words yes we're supporting Al Qaeda these bombings are
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:38.680]  good we want to disable as a sad just like we did with Gaddafi but it was a
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:43.480]  conspiracy theory for over a year now you've got Saudi Arabia massing you've
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:48.560]  got Turkey massing you had the shoot down of the Russian plane just a couple of
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:51.720]  months ago which nearly caused a new conflict and we're right on the
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:56.840]  precipice of that again and of course now we've got the death of Scalia there's a
[2:46:56.840 --> 2:47:01.680]  former US intelligence official I'm gonna write the article on this as soon as
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:05.360]  I get off the 4th hour hold on I want to get to that but first since you brought
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:08.880]  up Brennan the CIA director let's let's play a clip Paul and then again to
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:14.880]  Scalia talking about imminence and inevitability of ISIS Al Qaeda attacks
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:19.760]  in America when he literally has been funding and working with Hillary to give
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:24.160]  them their safe harbor in Syria then they blame Assad for it this is how dumb
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:29.320]  they think we are here it is Paul we have a number of instances where ISIL has
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:36.280]  used chemical munitions your Saudi Arabian brother artillery shells sure this
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:40.360]  is a chemical weapons classes has access to chemical artillery by the way we
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:44.880]  pointed out that they fall flat ISIS has access to Assad remember precursors
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:50.960]  and munitions that they can use the CIA believes that ISIS has the ability to
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:57.760]  manufacture small quantities of chlorine and mustard yeah and the CIA the faction
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:01.240]  run by this guy a known Saudi Arabian operative double agent on record
[2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:06.960]  literally we know it's like on Sesame Street saying we know that cookie monster
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:10.240]  has an ability to talk because you got your arm up it making it move I mean Paul
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:14.640]  I'm sorry I'm ranting go ahead and finish up with this let's get into Scalia well
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:20.160]  I mean 2013 Guter they tried to frame Assad for that chemical weapons attack
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:24.120]  that was the red line again they failed because we had the internet we were able
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:28.160]  to counter the narrative that chemical attack was launched from rebel controlled
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:32.080]  areas there was no evidence that Assad was behind it so they're likely to you
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:36.920]  know try something similar again but with the with the Scalia thing there's a
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:40.400]  top you a former US intelligence official who's basically saying the same
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:46.200]  thing as you the the pillow on the face was to send a message like you know
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:50.320]  Luke and Brassie sleeps with the fishers basically sounds like Alex Jones in
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:54.960]  his summary of what he thinks happens and then we've got you know my comment
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:59.160]  was this according to leftists in the media and you've highlighted some of the
[2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:03.760]  hit pieces earlier it's second demented to question the circumstances
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:10.560]  surrounding Scalia's death but celebrating Scalia's death is perfectly fine we
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:14.560]  got a new article they want to kill him in the liberal media they want him dead
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:18.160]  they called for his death and now he's dead though they didn't kill him but
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:23.280]  they're happy yeah so you had Buzzfeed editors you had a bunch of journalists
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:27.640]  you had them you said they were gonna you they were gonna take out Clarence
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:32.400]  Thomas next potentially that's what the left is now calling for on Twitter
[2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:36.800]  they're saying oh let's all pray that it's Clarence Thomas next so they're the
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:41.080]  ones that are engaging in these spiteful hateful comments they could have a
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:43.960]  liberal shoot Clarence Thomas on the street and they'd say it was natural
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:49.360]  causes yeah you know a thousand comments a day on Twitter saying kill Trump and
[2:49:49.360 --> 2:49:54.600]  they say it's it's sick and twisted for us to question the narrative of this
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:49:59.120]  while they're celebrating his death and they have Broadway shows about killing
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:02.160]  conservatives and professors say I'm gonna kill you of your tea party and
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:05.960]  they call for our death of these are just sick filth and the liberals aren't
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:08.640]  even getting money they're all getting screwed but they love it they love it
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:14.240]  they love it I mean they pose as taking the moral high ground when they
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:17.680]  violate their own principles again and again because they're complete hypocrites
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:21.400]  and they're not real liberals but there's a there's also a poll which I'm
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:27.160]  gonna talk about as well 79% in this poll think there's foul play involved in
[2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:32.880]  the death of Scalia and this was a poll that received 40,000 votes so it's
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:38.760]  quite the expansive polling of individuals on this particular website
[2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:42.960]  nearly eight out of ten think that there's foul play involved so this is
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:47.920]  like 90% of people I see you're talking to them and I mean people liberals
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:51.040]  conservatives but that those are conspiracy theorists you could have
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:55.360]  seven billion four hundred ninety nine million people saying that it was he was
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:50:59.400]  murdered and one liberal would say he wasn't I'm God don't ask questions what

[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:35.200]  dies in incredibly suspicious circumstances and as Paul pointed out the
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:39.920]  articles are on infowars.com he's writing more of them they're going now we
[2:54:39.920 --> 2:54:43.680]  want to kill Thomas next I mean and they're all these nobodies that don't
[2:54:43.680 --> 2:54:48.280]  even have jobs or their government workers and they just they like get off

[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:58.160]  mean they're Nazis and I guess they're gonna go the way the Nazis cuz man let
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:01.120]  me tell you something you want to get in a big fight with everybody with the
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:04.840]  American patriots and the veterans and the Christians and you want to fight
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:09.120]  the Russians and while you're at it you want to slap the Chinese around and
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:14.360]  that their super their government's super evil Paul we're about to go to break
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:18.040]  and I'm gonna hand the baton to you my friend to take over but and I meant to
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:20.440]  get into some of these hit piece articles that make fun of us about
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:24.400]  everything but the mainstream media doesn't seem to get they're discredited
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:28.240]  and no one hardly listens to them anymore so I do think there's major
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:32.280]  delusion by the elites here what else you want to add on that point and on the
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:38.360]  Scalia situation what's your what's your gut on this well there's a website
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:43.000]  called Jezebel which is this big social justice warrior feminist website all of
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:46.800]  absolute crap as he would expect and they put out a hit piece against you
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:51.320]  loopy conspiracist Alex Jones thinks justice Scalia was murdered because he's
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:58.240]  got told him so in the very first sentence they call you a racist okay the
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:04.040]  source for calling you a racist is a link to a YouTube video in which you say
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:10.440]  people who call for the death of white people a racist so their proof for you
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:16.680]  being a racist is you making an anti-racist argument during your radio show
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:21.800]  they also call you an anti-semi what's their source for calling you an anti-semi
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:26.400]  a link to a Forbes article in which they talk about comments by Charlie Sheen
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.280]  about Chuck Laurie and then they say for the record Jones himself has long
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.680]  taken pains to distance himself from over anti-semitism so their source for
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:39.880]  calling you an anti-semi is an article which says you're not an anti-semi this
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:44.620]  is the level of delusion being engaged in by the media after you made your
[2:56:44.620 --> 2:56:48.600]  comment on Scalia. I keep noticing that whether it's the city morning hero of
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:53.160]  the New York Times the proof they link to always discredits them like it's some
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:57.280]  weird joke or then I think are they really on our side because this is how
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:00.960]  you would discredit yourself what's are they just so delusional they don't care
[2:57:00.960 --> 2:57:07.960]  like a like a like a lobotomized monkey throwing his feces at people. Well these
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:12.160]  social justice worries don't normally care about facts they care about feelings
[2:57:12.160 --> 2:57:16.200]  and emotion and deceiving people so it's kind of like two plus two can equal five
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:19.360]  they're allowed to put a link that says I'm not racist this is proof that I'm
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:23.800]  racist. Yeah and you're an anti-semit and they linked to an article which
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:29.880]  says you're not an anti-semit by Forbes this can't just be sloppy journalism
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:34.400]  surely. Maybe it's satire maybe these are some of the greatest dark satire writers
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:39.800]  ever Paul. Because let me tell you know our joke used to be to read this for
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:42.640]  entertainment remember and we promised to stop doing it both of them we'd sit
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:45.000]  there for an hour on the phone every day you know a lot of times at night
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:48.600]  giggling and you know laughing about all this and was it five years ago we
[2:57:48.600 --> 2:57:52.120]  pledged to stop it right you don't call me I don't call you with it but it is
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:55.680]  really this is really some really good comedy I'm not kidding I mean this is
[2:57:55.680 --> 2:58:01.760]  hilarious folks. It's I mean we used to get blamed for not blaming the Jews for
[2:58:01.760 --> 2:58:05.120]  everything but now apparently we're anti-semit again so they can't seem to
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:07.720]  make their minds up. Well I'm the number one enemy on all the white
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:11.360]  supremacists for whatever crazy reason maybe because their government run but
[2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:17.480]  I'm also an anti-semit and a secret Nazi. Paul. Yeah and it's documented with
[2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:22.080]  proof that actually says the opposite. I know I was reading this thing it's like
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:26.720]  and Jones when he's not talking about UFOs says Hillary ordered a stand down
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:31.000]  in Benghazi it's on record the eight survivors were there and heard the order
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:33.720]  I'm gonna come back and do five more minutes with you Paul and then you're
[2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:36.880]  gonna take over the next hour fourth hour straight ahead we love you all
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:40.560]  folks we're marching forward we're with you we know you're supporting us we

[2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:57.760]  joins us you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what Brain Force did. I've
[2:58:57.760 --> 2:59:01.480]  been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in
[2:59:01.480 --> 2:59:05.680]  here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was
[2:59:05.680 --> 2:59:08.960]  gonna make it and I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my
[2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:12.160]  bottle of Brain Force right there I popped two of them and about 20 minutes
[2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:16.160]  later it's like everything just kind of clears up it's got four and a half
[2:59:16.160 --> 2:59:20.240]  stars people really love it read about it find out why third-party
[2:59:20.240 --> 2:59:24.280]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the

[2:59:28.600 --> 2:59:31.320]  all night or like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without
[2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:36.080]  Brain Force. I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up
[2:59:36.080 --> 2:59:40.560]  took two more Brain Force and came in. You will find Brain Force and other game

[2:59:48.840 --> 2:59:55.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:09.840]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:15.480]  network. When Hitler started losing his battle against England and in North
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:19.920]  Africa he started to attack Russia it's like you know I'm losing this battle
[3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:23.280]  with like a force a third the size the Russian force let me just go attack the
[3:00:23.280 --> 3:00:28.520]  Russians real quick and that's what psycho globalists do is historically the
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:33.760]  same types is when they start losing they start attacking everyone and I just
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:38.120]  wanted to not start a nuclear war Paul Watson what else is coming up in the
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:42.360]  next hour that you're gonna be hosting and I know I'm ranting here today but I
[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:46.680]  mean you just can't get more epic and again people go to football games they
[3:00:46.680 --> 3:00:50.240]  face paint they scream they yell for three hours till their horse and can't
[3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:54.000]  talk people think that's normal I think that's mentally ill I get upset about
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:01:00.960]  just insane levels of craziness Paul well I mean it's only natural and what I'm
[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:05.840]  gonna get into is more media deception there's the Huffington Post and a bunch
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:09.440]  of left-wing news outlets the Independent and others came out with this
[3:01:09.440 --> 3:01:14.200]  article claiming that only three refugees were involved in the mass
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:19.120]  molestation of women in Cologne on New Year's Eve turns out that they were
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:24.520]  talking about only the individuals who came from Syria in Iraq now the rest of
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:29.520]  the individuals came from Morocco Tunisia and these other countries they
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:34.920]  were migrants who had supposedly assimilated into Germany so in fact it
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:39.320]  was worse it was the migrants who had supposedly assimilated that were
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:44.240]  responsible for the rapes but then the top German prosecutor came out in
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:50.600]  Germany and said no the majority of them were recently arrived refugees and
[3:01:50.600 --> 3:01:53.480]  let's expand you're gonna cover all that you're gonna cover all that some of
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:57.680]  stop you what about Gloria Steinem basically defending to Bill Maher and
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:02.120]  saying Christians are the problem what is wrong with this sick freak can't we
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:08.400]  send this worm to Saudi Arabia well it's because she's a regressive leftist
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:11.720]  and she's abandoned any liberal principles that she could have claimed
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:16.560]  to have in the first place I've got you know I've seen comments today of people
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:21.560]  saying even if you dare raise the notion that migrants were responsible for
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:25.240]  things like Cologne you're blaming you're saying that all Muslims are rapists
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:28.960]  again it's this mental block where where they could never do any wrong they
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:34.600]  could never do any wrong yeah what do you make of the feminist groups and people
[3:02:34.600 --> 3:02:38.440]  well well former Secretary of State Marilyn Albright saying if you vote for
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:42.120]  Bernie Sanders and not Hillary you're going to hell if you're a woman I mean
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:48.160]  that is a cult of freaks women being lectured by some more criminal witch
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:52.320]  that you'd vote for a woman or you're going to hell I mean why do women want
[3:02:52.320 --> 3:02:58.920]  to be lectured to by the scum well it's all based around this entirely false
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:02.960]  premise that they've created which is that you know which is Hillary Clinton's
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:07.160]  platform which is what what's between her legs that's all she's got she's the
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:12.800]  uber feminist and yet it was her hiring people to intimidate Bill Clinton's
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:17.560]  rape victims but that's not reported in the Huffington Post so then they're not
[3:03:17.560 --> 3:03:21.520]  going to find out about it and even if they did they would dismiss it because
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:26.480]  it challenges their belief system and there's no more dogmatic belief system
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:31.000]  than this feminist mindset but I'll say this I'll say this to turn over to you
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:35.240]  Paul because I'm gonna get a lot coming up the truth is women have always run
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:40.920]  society in every major dominant culture and men go out like the drones to fight
[3:03:40.920 --> 3:03:44.680]  and work and gotta take care of them and there's been chivalry rules from Japan
[3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:49.600]  to ancient Europe that you don't target women and children or your tyrants and
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:53.080]  that it's men that get targeted men that do the fighting men that do the hanging
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:58.120]  men that get hung men that die the men that are the pirates the men that do it
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:03.320]  all the men that go into the coal mines the men you're to die you're a man you
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:07.160]  don't have value sacrifice yourself for the species and that's the truth that's
[3:04:07.160 --> 3:04:10.960]  what we do and they teach women oh you're gonna have freedom being in the
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:14.440]  draft you're gonna be at freedom not having a man being a slave to the state
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:18.880]  now and tell you that you're gonna get all this power out of it but all you get
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:24.000]  is enslavement and now Gloria Steinem and George Soros are your owners and so
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:31.120]  that's what these monsters are doing is stealing your future and so all that's
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:34.840]  happening is men have been removed men to a great extent don't exist anymore
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:38.840]  and there's nothing but a robot world government now here to destroy the
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:43.680]  species and so that's what you have to understand and that's what they've
[3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:48.920]  established and that's what they built and they are so incredibly proud of
[3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:54.760]  themselves and now women have no defense and are being overrun and enslaved
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:05:00.160]  Paul Watson's coming up I'm Alex Jones was Supreme Court Justice Antonin
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:04.080]  Scalia assassinated there's growing evidence suggesting that yes he was
[3:05:04.080 --> 3:05:07.240]  Scalia who once said he interpreted the bill arise no different than the
[3:05:07.240 --> 3:05:10.280]  founding fathers was found dead in his room while staying at a ranch owned by
[3:05:10.280 --> 3:05:13.960]  Democratic donor in the remote Big Bend region of West Texas for one thing
[3:05:13.960 --> 3:05:17.040]  Presidio County judge Cinderella Gabana first claimed that Scalia died of heart
[3:05:17.040 --> 3:05:20.360]  attack and then she later backed off that statement and claimed instead that he
[3:05:20.360 --> 3:05:24.560]  died of natural causes with no signs of foul play but she never saw the body in
[3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:28.520]  fact the Supreme Court Justice was found with a pillow over his head not only
[3:05:28.520 --> 3:05:32.000]  was there no autopsy performed on Scalia but his body was also rushed to a
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:34.960]  funeral home to be quickly embalmed a process which would destroy
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:38.440]  toxology evidence indicating whether he had been poisoned the Arch Conservatives
[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:42.160]  Scalia also posed many of Obama's policies on illegal immigration in gun
[3:05:42.160 --> 3:05:45.640]  control and Obama benefits from his death by now being able to appoint his own
[3:05:45.640 --> 3:05:48.360]  judge who will undoubtedly rubber-stamp the president's war on the

[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:37.360]  if you want to talk about the death of Antonin Scalia some of the questions
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:43.080]  that continue to swirl despite the best efforts of some on the left to
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:48.840]  characterize any questioning whatsoever of the official narrative as crass and
[3:08:48.840 --> 3:08:55.560]  insensitive while they simultaneously celebrate the death of Scalia and
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:09:00.920]  basically call for Clarence Thomas to be next we're gonna get into that we're
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:05.760]  also gonna get into a top former US intelligence official who had a top
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:11.280]  secret security clearance who basically sounds like Alex Jones he's saying that
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:17.280]  the pillow found on the face of Scalia was a tail was a signal being sent
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:22.960]  allow the godfather that Luca Brassi sleeps with the fishes we're gonna get
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:28.520]  into that but first I want to play this clip which is a summary of some of the
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:33.400]  questions being asked about the mysterious circumstances surrounding the
[3:09:33.400 --> 3:09:39.360]  death of Antonin Scalia here's the clip anytime an extremely prominent person
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:45.000]  in the sphere of politics or law dies in unclear circumstances the question needs
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:50.080]  to be asked was it foul play the circumstances behind the death of
[3:09:50.080 --> 3:09:55.840]  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia remain unclear does that mean he was
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:10:00.400]  murdered as part of a devious conspiracy by the Democrats to tip the balance in
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:06.800]  the Supreme Court before Obama leaves office no Scalia was a 79 year old man
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:11.400]  with admitted health problems and the likeliest explanation is that he died
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:16.720]  of natural causes but it doesn't take a wild conspiracy theorist to understand
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:22.280]  why people have questions why did law enforcement personnel tell Presidio
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:27.600]  County judge Cinderella Guavara that there was no evidence of foul play when
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:34.280]  Scalia was found alone in his room with a pillow over his head was the immediate
[3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:39.920]  clampdown on any suggestion of foul play an attempt to prevent an autopsy from
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:45.760]  taking place why did Guavara initially tell the media that Scalia had died of a
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:50.920]  heart attack before hastily changing her mind and saying he died of natural
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:56.040]  causes why did Guavara pronounce that Scalia had died of natural causes
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:11:03.000]  without having actually seen the body why is no autopsy taking place despite
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:08.760]  Guavara's confusion as to how Scalia died a decision disputed by other
[3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:15.680]  officials why was it necessary for no less than 20 police officers to escort
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:22.160]  Scalia's dead body to the Sunset funeral home in El Paso why was Scalia's body
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:29.600]  quickly embalmed a process that would destroy toxicology evidence why did
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:34.720]  Scalia reportedly refuse to be provided with security detail despite the fact
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:40.600]  that other Supreme Court justices had received death threats our reports true
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:45.240]  that Barack Obama was told about Scalia's death hours before a public
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:51.880]  announcement was made if so who told him was it John Poindexter the Texas
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:56.800]  businessman and Democratic Party donor who owned Cibolo Creek Ranch and was
[3:11:56.800 --> 3:12:02.040]  reportedly one of the first to learn of Scalia's death and why does any of this
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:06.600]  matter well if Obama is able to get his choice of Supreme Court justice
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:13.640]  confirmed to replace Scalia America could be radically transformed Scalia was a
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:17.760]  strict constitutionalist who consistently voted to protect free speech
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:23.520]  freedom of religion and the individual right to bear arms all of those
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:29.600]  liberties and more are now under threat if Obama is able to appoint a leftist
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:36.120]  activist judge before he leaves the White House given this monumental motive
[3:12:36.120 --> 3:12:41.440]  and the unclear circumstances surrounding Scalia's death the emergence of
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:47.000]  conspiracy theories is hardly a surprise
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:51.480]  so that's the summary of some of the questions surrounding the death of Antonin
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:12:56.040]  Scalia and again this is the question I've been asking this is the comment
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:13:00.360]  I made on Twitter about an hour ago according to leftists it's thick and
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:04.680]  demented to question the circumstances surrounding Scalia's death but
[3:13:04.680 --> 3:13:12.920]  celebrating Scalia's death is perfectly fine so we had this deluge of hip pieces
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:17.160]  over the weekend some of which Alex covered earlier basically attacking
[3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:22.320]  Alex attacking him for wars merely for highlighting some of these unanswered
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:28.040]  questions surrounding Scalia's death which the Washington Post itself
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:34.160]  highlighted and admitted that the circumstances were still unclear but we
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:38.120]  got the blame simply for asking the question it was crass it was insensitive
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:43.240]  and I mentioned this when I was on with Alex this is out of Jezebel.com a
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:49.080]  feminist social justice warrior website loopy conspiracist Alex Jones thinks
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:53.560]  Justice Scalia was murdered because his gut told him so listen to the first
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:59.680]  sentence of this article noted conspiracy theorists illuminati believer
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:06.320]  racist and lovable anti-Semite Alex Jones has made yet another grab for the
[3:14:06.320 --> 3:14:13.200]  spotlight okay so they have hyperlinks from these claims that Alex Jones
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:19.320]  is a racist and an anti-Semite now of course most of the idiotic readers are
[3:14:19.320 --> 3:14:23.160]  not gonna click on those hyperlinks they're gonna swallow the story whole
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:27.120]  without questioning it but I actually took the trouble to click on those links
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:34.320]  the link that claims to prove that Alex Jones is a racist is a link to a YouTube
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:42.120]  video in which Alex Jones attacks racist people who express the opinion that all
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:49.720]  white people should die so again the proof that Alex Jones is a racist is a
[3:14:49.720 --> 3:14:56.760]  video in which he argues against racism the proof that Alex Jones is an anti
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:01.560]  semi and again you can click on the hyperlink from this article it goes to
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:08.280]  Forbes.com an article entitled who is Alex Jones anyway five fun factoids and
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:13.240]  one of those factoids is a mention of how when Charlie Sheen was on the show
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:18.480]  back I guess it was a couple of years ago now he had made supposedly anti-Semitic
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:22.520]  comments about Chuck Laurie again those comments whether you believe they were
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:30.080]  anti-Semitic or not were made by Charlie Sheen not Alex Jones in fact in this
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:36.320]  article the author states quote for the record Jones himself has long taken
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:43.760]  pains to distance himself from over anti-Semitism or racism of any kind so
[3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:47.680]  again the proof that Alex Jones is an anti-Semite according to this Jezebel
[3:15:47.680 --> 3:15:54.720]  article is a link to an article which says that Jones is not an anti-Semite
[3:15:54.720 --> 3:16:00.440]  that's the level that's the level of proof we have presented here these ad
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:05.560]  hominem arguments that actually prove the opposite of what they're claiming
[3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:11.120]  that's how weak and pathetic this hit piece is and there were many others there
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:16.300]  was a Sydney Morning Herald all of a similar tone but this perhaps takes the
[3:16:16.300 --> 3:16:21.360]  biscuit for the most outlandish from the most weak in terms of an actual
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:26.320]  argument where their claims are disproven by the supposed proof that they
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:32.440]  present in the form of these hyperlinks so again we had a deluge of attacks
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:36.840]  saying that it was crass insensitive to even ask questions about what happened
[3:16:36.840 --> 3:16:42.720]  to Scalia but again it was perfectly okay for the left to celebrate Scalia's
[3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:50.120]  death you had a Buzzfeed editor tweeting out in emoji of a party popper you had
[3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:55.880]  other people calling for Clarence Thomas the black conservative Supreme Court
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:17:00.080]  justice to be next that's all perfectly fine that's not crass that's not
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:04.680]  insensitive but don't you dare question the official narrative my god how dare
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:09.440]  you you dangerous evil conspiracy theories so this is an article up on
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:13.960]  enforce.com right now leftist journalist social media users spew torrent of hate
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:19.440]  on hearing of Scalia's death we have the screenshots from the tweets and there
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:24.320]  are other articles in which they focus on tweets made by journalists people in
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:30.840]  the media as well as just leftists in general and listen to the tone here FU
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:37.160]  Scalia rot in hell learn the law while you're down there here's another one
[3:17:37.160 --> 3:17:43.440]  since death is the only way for a fat evil effort like Scalia to be removed
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:50.080]  from the Supreme Court hooray death here's another one I know Hitler actually
[3:17:50.080 --> 3:17:54.520]  killed millions whereas Scalia was a bigot in speech but speech often leads
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:18:00.720]  to actions hence the comparison rest in hell Scalia proceed mr. president
[3:18:00.720 --> 3:18:06.880]  goodbye justice Scalia now go to hell if Scalia's death is sad the thousands
[3:18:06.880 --> 3:18:09.640]  who will die as a result of his suspending Obama's greenhouse gas
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:16.120]  emissions is far far sadder and it goes on and on liberals fantasizing and
[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:22.040]  glorifying celebrating the death of Scalia but where the ones who are being
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:28.160]  insensitive for asking why there was no autopsy why the police told the judge
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:33.840]  involved that there were no signs of foul play when Scalia had a pillow over
[3:18:33.840 --> 3:18:39.400]  his face that's insensitive even to ask those questions it's insensitive to ask
[3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:45.560]  why his dead body was transported to the funeral home by no less than 20
[3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:54.080]  police officers 20 police officers for one dead body now you can understand it
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:58.520]  being you know having some kind of police guard around it but it's a corpse
[3:18:58.520 --> 3:19:06.200]  not to be vulgar but you really need 20 police officers to guard a corpse this
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:11.080]  is one of the questions that people are asking this is why we have polls now
[3:19:11.080 --> 3:19:17.160]  79% suspect foul play in death of Antonin Scalia this is the conservative
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:22.840]  outfitters website they have 40,000 people in fact it's probably closer to
[3:19:22.840 --> 3:19:31.480]  45,000 now vote in this poll 79% of them almost 8 out of 10 said that there was
[3:19:31.480 --> 3:19:35.480]  foul play involved in the death of Scalia though to try and character crack
[3:19:35.480 --> 3:19:40.840]  and try and characterize these questions as the the frit the domain of fringe
[3:19:40.840 --> 3:19:45.720]  extremists which the mainstream media has gone even though basically the
[3:19:45.720 --> 3:19:51.240]  Washington Post is pointing out the same things is again completely misrepresented
[3:19:51.240 --> 3:19:54.480]  of the sentiment that's out there we'll get more into it after the break and

[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:30.880]  you're an evil demented conspiracy theorist who has been crass and
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:36.120]  insensitive if you draw attention to any of these unanswered questions about the
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:40.520]  death of Antonin Scalia unanswered questions that have been highlighted by
[3:24:40.520 --> 3:24:45.240]  the likes of the Washington Post we didn't invent these facts these
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:50.400]  circumstances out of thin air but your crass you're insensitive for doing that
[3:24:50.400 --> 3:24:55.800]  but if you celebrate the death of Antonin Scalia and then call for the death
[3:24:55.800 --> 3:25:01.560]  of Clarence Thomas that's liberal and trendy this is out of twitchy.com
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:07.200]  Clarence Thomas trends as liberals update their death wish lists for
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:12.360]  Scaliers poppin listen to some of these tweets that were sent out in the
[3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:18.920]  media aftermath of the announcement of Scaliers death about Clarence Thomas the
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:25.280]  second-ever black Supreme Court justice who of course is a conservative this is
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:30.000]  these are tweets from actual leftists well if he dies during black history
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:35.360]  month I'll never question God again fingers crossed Clarence Thomas is next
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:40.000]  Clarence Thomas will probably outlive all of us evil old black people live
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:44.360]  forever my family is full of them that's that was a tweet by a black guy
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:50.520]  here's another one this is going to sound cold but one down one to go
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:56.560]  Uncle Rockus Clarence Thomas needs to go next then our country can start healing
[3:25:56.560 --> 3:26:01.760]  these are actual tweets from leftists here's another now we just need the
[3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:07.960]  Grim Reaper to take out Clarence Thomas and they'll be dancing in the streets so
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:13.960]  I ask you which is crass and insensitive asking questions about why there was no
[3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:20.440]  autopsy why his face had a pillow over it when he supposedly you know died in his
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:26.400]  sleep on his own in his hotel room why is it crass and insensitive to ask why
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:32.960]  his body needed a police escort of 20 officers why is it crass and insensitive
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:37.720]  to simply challenge the narrative on this issue but then it's perfectly
[3:26:37.720 --> 3:26:44.360]  fine to openly glorify and celebrate the death of someone while then calling for
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:50.200]  the death of Clarence Thomas again completely despicable behavior from the
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:56.560]  left they will whine and all day they will whine about people like Trayvon
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:02.000]  Martin they will whine about the criminal Michael Brown and then they will
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:07.200]  actually call for the death of successful African Americans simply because
[3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:12.560]  they have the wrong politics perfectly fine to call for the death of Clarence
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:18.760]  Thomas because he's a conservative apparently we've got Twitter bringing out
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:24.600]  this new censorship program making an alliance with social justice warriors to
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:30.520]  censor conservatives to define criticism of Islam as hate speech to broaden the
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:35.000]  definition of harassment so that it includes telling a feminist she's a
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:40.280]  liar or she sucks and yet you've got hundreds and hundreds of people on
[3:27:40.280 --> 3:27:46.040]  Twitter every day not only celebrating the death of Antonin Scalia not only
[3:27:46.040 --> 3:27:50.720]  calling for Clarence Thomas to be next but calling for the death of Donald
[3:27:50.720 --> 3:27:55.840]  Trump every single day on Twitter I mean just go to Twitter right now and Google
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:02.440]  in quotation marks kill Donald Trump as a quote you will find hundreds and
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:07.480]  thousands of individuals on Twitter who do that every single day do their
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:12.920]  accounts get suspended no do they get reported for hate speech no in fact I
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:17.120]  think there was only one incident where a guy who was maniacally waving knives
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:22.680]  around on camera threatening to castrate Donald Trump actually got a secret
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:28.840]  service visit but you have leftists on Twitter engaging in actual violent hate
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:34.080]  speech every day and this is what this was with Clarence Thomas born-aligned
[3:28:34.080 --> 3:28:39.160]  violent hate speech and yet we're the ones who are crass and insensitive for
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:45.080]  asking these questions so we're gonna get your take on that after the break here's
[3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:49.000]  another article out of Breitbart hour one liberals respond to Antonin Scalia's
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:54.040]  death with hatred mockery joy within one hour of news breaking that Supreme
[3:28:54.040 --> 3:28:58.680]  Court Justice Scalia died in his sleep progressives on Twitter put politics
[3:28:58.680 --> 3:29:04.640]  before basic human decency both celebrating and mocking his death so
[3:29:04.640 --> 3:29:10.320]  again more tweets we've got regressive leftist like Glenn Greenwald
[3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:14.920]  couldn't wait to jump in the fray I mean at least these people could keep quiet
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:21.000]  right they're not forced to express their respect and somber condolences for the
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:26.200]  death of anyone but they chose to exploit the situation not only to denigrate
[3:29:26.200 --> 3:29:30.360]  Justice Scalia but in some cases to celebrate his death
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:36.120]  Charles Manning senior style editor for Cosmopolitan.com said quote the devil
[3:29:36.120 --> 3:29:41.640]  is back in hell yay this was hours after his death was announced again
[3:29:41.640 --> 3:29:46.160]  completely crass and insensitive but we're evil for questioning Scalia's death
[3:29:46.160 --> 3:29:51.160]  we'll be right back with your calls we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[3:29:51.160 --> 3:29:56.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[3:34:24.920 --> 3:34:29.480]  I was visiting Austin last year so all those great products are at info wars
[3:34:29.480 --> 3:34:34.600]  store.com and again vital to support this broadcast and the expansion of
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:40.560]  info wars so obviously we're talking about Antonin Scalia and as you heard in
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:44.640]  the video you know this was a 79 year old guy he had health problems yes
[3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:50.800]  Occam's razor suggests that natural causes the most likely explanation for
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:56.000]  his death but when you have all these unanswered questions these unclear
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  circumstances as the Washington Post defined it it's only natural to ask
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:06.880]  questions given the political prominence of Scalia and the fact that the
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:14.320]  Supreme Court could now be tipped back in the balance of leftists on major major
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:20.240]  issues such as gun control abortion free speech the Fourth Amendment which we're
[3:35:20.240 --> 3:35:25.520]  going to get into they're now talking about Loretta Lynch being the favorite
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:31.280]  to replace Scalia who was extremely strong on the Fourth Amendment he made
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:36.160]  numerous rulings again protecting the right of Americans against unlawful
[3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:41.240]  searches and seizures then you've got Loretta Lynch who doesn't even believe
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:46.280]  in the concept of innocent innocent and still proven guilty she's pro-asset
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:52.200]  forfeiture seizure which again no Warren no evidence of a crime the police can
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:58.320]  take your money take your property again presumed guilt before innocence
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:03.280]  that's what Loretta Lynch believes it and they're talking about her being the
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:08.880]  potential next Supreme Court justice to replace Scalia so of course this is a
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:15.200]  monumental turn this could completely transform America so it's only right to
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:20.760]  ask questions about the circumstances surrounding Scalia's death which we will
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:25.560]  continue to do gonna go to some of these calls now that Walt in Michigan you're
[3:36:25.560 --> 3:36:28.560]  on the air go ahead Walt
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:35.280]  hello Joseph here's what my take on it is Scalia showed that he was a nationalist
[3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:41.240]  in his ideology and his positions but the con for the contrast of him belonging
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:46.520]  to the Knights of Malta in Opus Dei which are inter-nationalists and with
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:50.360]  support for Rome's calling for a new world order and redistribution of the
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:54.520]  wealth and carbon taxes and he's against our Constitution ideologically and
[3:36:54.520 --> 3:37:02.000]  Papacy has been all along Scalia seems to have run contrary to his bosses
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:09.760]  directions that were given to Obama when he came here to visit no I mean the
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:13.560]  point is the rulings he'd made I hear you on the the organizations he was
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:17.400]  affiliated to but I mean you look at the Fourth Amendment and you look at the
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:21.720]  First Amendment free speech Texas versus Johnson he voted that flag burning was a
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:26.280]  constitutionally protected expression again he came down on the side of the
[3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:33.800]  Constitution Brown versus EMA double this is our Max Lavo SHTF plan a double
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:36.960]  victory for First Amendment advocates that protected both depictions of
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:40.720]  violence and minors rights and he dissented in Maryland versus King
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:45.600]  arguing that the Fourth Amendment forbids law enforcement from collecting DNA from
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:49.520]  the rest ease and there are more cases though down the line with the Fourth
[3:37:49.520 --> 3:37:52.080]  Amendment and with the First Amendment he's been on the side of the
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:56.800]  Constitution then you get someone like Loretta Lynch who doesn't even believe
[3:37:56.800 --> 3:38:00.880]  that Americans are innocent until proven guilty in the context of asset
[3:38:00.880 --> 3:38:04.680]  forfeiture seizure so that's why people are concerned about this but thanks for
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:09.360]  the call we're gonna go to Mike in Virginia you're on the air Mike go ahead
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:15.120]  hey Mike you know I've heard about that the pillow and everything and you know
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:23.680]  you don't need an autopsy by a corner or a pathologist to determine whether
[3:38:23.680 --> 3:38:33.880]  Scalia was a fixiated with the pillow all one has to do is open up his eyes and
[3:38:33.880 --> 3:38:39.160]  look at the eyes and if you see red dots on the eye you know that Anthony
[3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:47.480]  Scalia was a fixiated and you don't have to be a pathologist to know what to look
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:54.960]  for all you look for is red spots in the eyes a secret service agent FBI agent
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:39:00.400]  or an executive security officer branch agent could look at his eyes and they
[3:39:00.400 --> 3:39:06.680]  determine whether he was a fixiated or not and and like I say the funeral
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:11.240]  director for the funeral home could open up his eyes and look for the red dots
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:16.320]  if there's no red dots in the eyes he wasn't a fixiated that's a common thing
[3:39:16.320 --> 3:39:21.000]  that happens when one gets a fixiated and that's the truth you're not hearing
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:28.680]  well exactly and but judge judge guavara she declared that he had died of natural
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:32.720]  causes first she said heart attack then changed her mind almost immediately she
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:37.720]  said that Scalia had died of natural causes without even having seen the body
[3:39:37.720 --> 3:39:42.680]  it was done via a telephone call the police said there were no there was no
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:46.640]  evidence whatsoever of any foul play again despite the fight that the pillow
[3:39:46.640 --> 3:39:51.720]  was found on his head as we later found out and again there's this report that
[3:39:51.720 --> 3:39:59.040]  he was almost immediately embalmed so again destroying any potential toxicology
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:04.840]  evidence now I'm not a medical examiner obviously but these questions do need to
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:10.880]  be answered this is extremely suspicious given the prominence of Scalia so yes
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:15.360]  presumably it would be easy to tell if you know there had been foul play if he
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:20.560]  had been a fixiated but we're not gonna get access to that because no autopsy is
[3:40:20.560 --> 3:40:24.960]  going to happen they've already pronounced him dead of natural causes
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:30.760]  again via a telephone call without even seeing the body I mean that sounds
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:35.040]  pretty unprecedented I know it is generally accepted that that's the
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:42.160]  case in Texas but again just the rush to judgment on this is extremely eyebrow
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:45.120]  raising to say the least and we're not saying I'm not saying that he was
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:49.140]  murdered I'm saying the likelihood is that you know he had health problems we
[3:40:49.140 --> 3:40:53.640]  know that they were reported beforehand but again these questions need to be
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:58.960]  answered that's why we're talking about it we're gonna go to John in Idaho you're
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:06.760]  on the air John go ahead yes thank you Paul I was going over the Obama short
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:13.800]  list for replacements here but as you know as we move through this process and
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:20.560]  we continue to dig deeper what I'm coming in to contact with is the idea
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:27.400]  that being that this is his last year in office he's trying to position the
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:34.960]  Supreme Court in a manner that will be conducive to cooperating with the the
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:42.920]  UN World Court and so basically this goes above and beyond our own nation in
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:47.840]  terms of trying to put more liberal judges or more conservative that's not
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:56.440]  even the issue the issue here is flushing out somebody like a Scalia and
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:04.200]  like a Thomas so that will make headway for scenarios down the down the road
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:13.080]  in the future where Supreme Court will have to give themselves over to the UN
[3:42:13.080 --> 3:42:21.320]  World Court and then that goes into the whole thing with with the UN you know
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:27.280]  basically superseding continuing to supersede our own countries laws and
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:34.320]  our own way of doing things here with our government but another thing Paul I
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:39.080]  wanted to bring up I tried to email you about a week and a half two weeks ago in
[3:42:39.080 --> 3:42:45.640]  regard to the possible use of low yield tactical nuclear weapons in Yemen by the
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:53.120]  Saudis and I sent think an email to the tips line and or the tips email and I
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:58.280]  think to yours I don't know if you received that but I was just trying to
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:02.800]  see if anybody could help me make some headway bombarded constantly the best
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:07.040]  way to get it to me is probably via Facebook if you use Facebook or via
[3:43:07.040 --> 3:43:11.440]  Twitter because those are the ones I check most regularly but thanks for the
[3:43:11.440 --> 3:43:14.880]  call and yeah the point about the UN of course we had the carbon emissions
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:21.680]  thrown out just recently the UN is pushing this agenda 21 global carbon
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:26.600]  tax model and the Supreme Court has proven somewhat of a block against that
[3:43:26.600 --> 3:43:30.080]  but here's the other angle and we're gonna go to this clip in a second before
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:35.960]  we go back to your calls basically you've got the Democrats saying how dare
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:41.360]  those nasty Republicans even entertain the notion that they could block Obama's
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:46.600]  next Supreme Justice appointment to replace Scalia because of course that
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:51.320]  has to happen while Obama is still in office which is only going to be about
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:56.520]  for another 10 11 months so they're chastising the Republicans because they've
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:43:59.920]  made noises that they might try and block this might try and drag it out
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:05.400]  until potentially a Republican takes the Oval Office in the next election and
[3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:08.600]  again they're saying how dare they do this for 10 11 months this is
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:14.480]  anti-democratic this is disgraceful well this is what Chuck Schumer said the
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:23.360]  Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer back in 2007 here's the clip from Fox News isn't
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:28.920]  it ironic too that Justice Scalia was he was he was one to say publicly I wish
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:35.640]  it were different I wish the court had not found itself in this position in
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:40.240]  American political culture but I take you back to 2007 now here is Chuck
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:44.880]  Schumer I think it was about 18 months right before the election I think that's
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:49.640]  right the summer of 2007 and this is what he said about appointments then in
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:56.960]  an election year we should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:45:06.480]  except in extraordinary circumstances they must prove they must prove by
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:11.000]  actions not words that they are in the mainstream rather than we have to prove
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:22.080]  that they are not I would imagine so now we have Fox News doing a flashback to
[3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:29.360]  Chuck Schumer back in 2007 again 18 months before Bush left office saying
[3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:34.480]  we have to block Bush's next Supreme Court appointment so you got Democrats
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:38.040]  whining about Republicans threatening to do the same thing for a period of what
[3:45:38.040 --> 3:45:44.520]  10 11 months they were wanting to do it 18 months before Bush left office almost
[3:45:44.520 --> 3:45:49.880]  double the time period so again that just highlights the hypocrisy with the
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:54.600]  speculation surrounding this next Supreme Court appointment we're gonna go back
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:45:59.000]  to these calls now though we have who do we have Joe in Delaware you're on the
[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:03.440]  air go ahead I'll make this call short and thank you so much for taking my
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:07.720]  call I'll do this in chronological order if you will allow me to serve on the
[3:46:07.720 --> 3:46:14.000]  subject of political assassinations first case 1950s Soviet KGB and Western
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:19.120]  Germany assassinated two Ukrainian national leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan
[3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:24.000]  Bondera with the pen-like device that emitted a poison spray that upon
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:29.440]  autopsy showed up to be a heart attack they would not find out about it except
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:36.080]  for the defection of the defector and the KGB officer both Don Stasinski second
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:42.000]  case in point the book by the CIA officer Victor Marchetti in 1970s the
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:46.320]  search for the Manchurian candidate third case in the public record as you
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:50.240]  British would like to say in point by the author and former Mossad officer
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:56.720]  Victor Ostrovsky on Mossad assassination what assassination methods where we have
[3:46:56.720 --> 3:47:00.400]  found and again this has been verified in the public record recently where the
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:06.120]  Mossad has assassinated people with drugs and used up to 14 people using
[3:47:06.120 --> 3:47:12.080]  40 senior passports in Dubai you know his and his team device against Arab
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:18.480]  nationalists the discrete Israel and to make it look like natural causes through
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:22.720]  drugs and pillows so that's my comment for the show I think you're taking my
[3:47:22.720 --> 3:47:29.280]  call okay thanks Joe no I mean that's the point isn't it false flags by no
[3:47:29.280 --> 3:47:34.680]  means a fringe conspiracy theory they're an admitted form of statecraft and have
[3:47:34.680 --> 3:47:39.720]  been for several decades operation gladio again the Italian parliament
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:45.360]  investigated this they found numerous examples of state involvement in
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:51.640]  assassinations in terrorist attacks throughout the 60s 70s and 80s when they
[3:47:51.640 --> 3:47:55.760]  wanted at the time to blame it on left wing groups government involvement in
[3:47:55.760 --> 3:48:01.640]  assassinations and terror attacks this is not hairbrained conspiracy theory
[3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:07.000]  that were even entertaining this notion now let's go to more of your calls here
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:12.800]  we have John in New York you're on the edge on go ahead hey John Paul this is
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:20.400]  John in New York I'm I'm gonna say something about how the I used to work
[3:48:20.400 --> 3:48:23.800]  in the news business and major television network on the west side of
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:32.920]  Manhattan and I'm seeing that they are diverting a lot of this stuff the
[3:48:32.920 --> 3:48:37.880]  attention is being drawn away from let's say the confirmation of Loretta
[3:48:37.880 --> 3:48:46.360]  Lynch and we will see an event that will steal the the funder from an
[3:48:46.360 --> 3:48:53.640]  investigation of Loretta Lynch they'll be a possible other kind of an attack or
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:49:00.600]  news event and it will cause the info wars to operate in a deficit trying to
[3:49:00.600 --> 3:49:06.120]  prevent themselves from being labeled as conspiracy theorist what I believe we
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:09.800]  need to do is create from the public these last couple of calls we're
[3:49:09.800 --> 3:49:16.840]  brilliant people and to create a list of possible events that will be used in
[3:49:16.840 --> 3:49:23.680]  advance to steal the thunder away and to make info wars look like jerks I
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:30.480]  believe that one of the things that could possibly be I phoned in back
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:36.400]  in January and said that ten nuclear fuel rods fell down inside the reactor
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:43.640]  pool at the Indian Point the great interrupter of your your boss sometimes
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:51.120]  rushes ahead and he didn't let me finish I believe that those that incident is not
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:57.280]  over yet they did not the water has now been found to have 65,000 times the
[3:49:57.280 --> 3:50:04.120]  amount of radioactivity that I believe is going to be used as another item to
[3:50:04.120 --> 3:50:09.880]  steal the thunder away when it turns out that Indian Point is another Fukushima
[3:50:09.880 --> 3:50:15.880]  on the edge of the Hudson it is my thought that if Hillary Clinton gets in
[3:50:15.880 --> 3:50:22.720]  trouble there will be an incident where patriots invade an armory and steal
[3:50:22.720 --> 3:50:29.880]  hundreds of weapons and the the new world order safe safe cities thing will
[3:50:29.880 --> 3:50:34.840]  have to do has to house break-ins to get all the weapons away from the people
[3:50:34.840 --> 3:50:40.920]  that will steal thunder away or there'll be a possible attempt on Bill Clinton's
[3:50:40.920 --> 3:50:45.960]  life somebody will have lined the staircase with banana peels and Bill
[3:50:45.960 --> 3:50:50.920]  will be okay we got to leave it there interesting scenarios I mean a lot could
[3:50:50.920 --> 3:50:55.160]  happen between now and the election we'll be back in the final segment this

[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:16.280]  there's a former us intelligence official named ray starman who's come out with an
[3:54:16.280 --> 3:54:19.560]  interesting article again this is the guy who had
[3:54:19.560 --> 3:54:24.360]  top secret clearance and he basically sounds like alex jones
[3:54:24.360 --> 3:54:27.640]  and he talks about the pillow which was apparently found on the head of
[3:54:27.640 --> 3:54:31.640]  Antonin Scalia he says the pillow over the head is a warning
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:34.600]  the same people who want you to believe Scalia died of a heart attack or
[3:54:34.600 --> 3:54:37.640]  natural causes are the same people who want you to believe that
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:42.760]  Hillary won the Iowa caucuses with six coin tosses and the same people who
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:45.560]  want you to believe after 50 years that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:49.880]  assassin of president kennedy of course the msn has reported on
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:55.160]  none of this so he's come out said it looks very suspicious looks like foul
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:54:58.680]  play references again luke brassy sleeps with the fish
[3:54:58.680 --> 3:55:02.200]  as he thinks that was a signal that was a tell
[3:55:02.200 --> 3:55:05.560]  that there was foul play involved so we're going to get more into that i'll
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:09.560]  put an article about that up on the website after i get off
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:14.360]  air here a few more articles to cover here in the closing minutes
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:21.000]  Breitbart reports left media migrant rape cover-up huff post independent and
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:25.880]  united nations claim cologne attackers not refugees
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:30.040]  german prosecutor responds total nonsense
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:34.040]  mainstream media outlets have been blasted for peddling quote total
[3:55:34.040 --> 3:55:37.960]  nonsense today as left-wing newspapers coalesce to claim
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:43.000]  with one voice the only three of the suspects involved in cologne's mass
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:48.040]  migrant rape on new year's eve were recent migrants or refugees
[3:55:48.040 --> 3:55:53.080]  so basically they came out and said because only three of the individuals
[3:55:53.080 --> 3:55:56.920]  so far identified by authorities as having been involved in the mass
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:00.040]  molestation of women not only in cologne on new year's eve other
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:03.800]  cities only three of those are from iraq or
[3:56:03.800 --> 3:56:08.680]  syria so they only count people as being refugees if they're from iraq
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:13.880]  or syria but of course we know that thousands hundreds of thousands of
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:17.080]  individuals from numerous countries all over the middle east
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:20.760]  have poured into europe over the past year
[3:56:20.760 --> 3:56:25.400]  they're not refugees they're economic migrants fleeing to get on welfare and
[3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:28.680]  benefits so the rest of the culprits in the
[3:56:28.680 --> 3:56:32.520]  cologne attack have been identified as marocans
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:37.080]  as tunisians as people from all these different parts of the world
[3:56:37.080 --> 3:56:42.280]  and the prosecutor came out and said yes they are refugees they've come in over
[3:56:42.280 --> 3:56:45.720]  the past year so again completely disproving
[3:56:45.720 --> 3:56:48.360]  this narrative that went out over the weekend
[3:56:48.360 --> 3:56:52.360]  that only three of the individuals involved were refugees
[3:56:52.360 --> 3:56:57.320]  of course even if that were true then it only provides us with a bigger problem
[3:56:57.320 --> 3:57:02.760]  if it were true that only three out of the 60 odd culprits were refugees
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:08.040]  then the rest were immigrants who had supposedly been assimilated into
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:11.960]  german society and yet they were still carrying out
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:15.480]  these rapes these thefts these molestations
[3:57:15.480 --> 3:57:18.440]  so even if the initial claim was true which it wasn't
[3:57:18.440 --> 3:57:22.360]  that would be a bigger problem yet they tried to spin it as
[3:57:22.360 --> 3:57:25.880]  oh look at all these right wingers your talking point
[3:57:25.880 --> 3:57:29.480]  that migrants are to blame for cologne has been demolished
[3:57:29.480 --> 3:57:32.760]  well no it hasn't been demolished because the german prosecutor came out
[3:57:32.760 --> 3:57:36.680]  immediately afterwards and said that those claims
[3:57:36.680 --> 3:57:40.680]  were quote total nonsense so that narrative is completely
[3:57:40.680 --> 3:57:43.240]  backfired
[3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:46.920]  but this out of species.com swedish national police chief cannot
[3:57:46.920 --> 3:57:51.080]  guarantee the safety of the swedish people anymore
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:54.200]  in and is one of the countries that's accepted a wave of migrants now you've
[3:57:54.200 --> 3:57:57.240]  got the police chief saying it's out of control
[3:57:57.240 --> 3:58:01.880]  these muslim ghetto areas are no go zones we can't get police in there
[3:58:01.880 --> 3:58:05.800]  and crime is escalating we've also got this out of Breitbart
[3:58:05.800 --> 3:58:09.640]  tommy robinson attacked hospitalized one week after revealing islamista
[3:58:09.640 --> 3:58:13.720]  out to killing again a prominent critic of islam who's been on this show a
[3:58:13.720 --> 3:58:17.560]  couple of times attacked in the street not unconscious
[3:58:17.560 --> 3:58:21.400]  while out with his wife this is the religion of
[3:58:21.400 --> 3:58:26.840]  peace exacting its revenge once again but stay tuned tonight for
