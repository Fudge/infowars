[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Loose weight and feel great.
[00:02.000 --> 00:05.000]  If you're uncomfortable with credit cards or PayPal, that's okay.
[00:05.000 --> 00:08.000]  Call us for our address and send a check or money order.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  The phone number is 928-308-0408.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  Once again, thank you from GetTheT.com.
[00:19.000 --> 00:26.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Big Brother.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  You want answers?
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  It is Friday, the 28th of November, 2008, the day after Thanksgiving.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving with your family.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  And hope you gave thanks for what this country has stood for in the past.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  The Republic, our liberties, our freedoms, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  all of which is under assault by the Pentagon,
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  under assault by the foreign banks that control the Pentagon and the executive,
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  as well as many of the leaders of the legislative.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  They are enemies of the Republic.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  They are openly declaring war on the Bill of Rights and the Constitution,
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  making themselves tyrants and treacherous traitors.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  That does not mean our enlisted men and women are tyrants or treacherous traitors.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  Any more than people in the German military that stood up against Hitler
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  and traitors against the German military or the German people.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  In fact, they were defenders.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  And make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  I took off, what, Wednesday and Thursday, and it was very hard to do that.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  In fact, yesterday morning, I called up the network and they had a skeleton crew,
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  just somebody in there to make sure all the computers fired and replayed the shows.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  And I was told I couldn't go live yesterday.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  Then about an hour later, John Harmon, who's my regular guy right on the show
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  up in Minnesota, I'm down here in Texas, called me and said,
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  I'll come in if you want.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  I said, no, let's just go live tomorrow.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  So here we are.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  Why did I want to go live on Thanksgiving?
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  Well, because of the string of bombings and attacks and hostage-taking in India.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  And we have the most detailed reporting you'll find anywhere at infowars.com
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  and presentplanted.com for Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and Kurt Nemo, all of them doing great jobs
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  writing news stories on Thanksgiving.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  So we'll be going over that with Paul Watson, who is joining us in about 10 minutes
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  for the balance of this hour.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  But I did something else Wednesday night and Thursday night.
[02:57.000 --> 03:10.000]  A lot of research, a lot of research on the memo put out by Secretary of Defense Gates.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  And I have that in front of me here today.
[03:14.000 --> 03:25.000]  I read the entire 50-something page memo last night, Secretary of Defense,
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  Memorandum for Secretaries of the Military Departments,
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  Recommendations on the Commission of the National Guard Reserves.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  And it's worse than even I had thought.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  They openly declare the states are vassals of the federal government.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  The governors are vassals.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  That regular army will be used against the American people in our everyday lives.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  The National Guard is to be abolished and rolled into North Come completely.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  And he admits in here that this was already done covertly.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  Over and over again they say no changes needed, no further recommendations needed already operational.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  This is just an announcement to the world.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  You see, the private banks took over the U.S. in 1913.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  Then they engineered the Great Depression to get us under federal control
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  with the War Powers Act and the Emergency Powers Act of 1933.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  And then the American people in the 70s didn't want wars, didn't want to be an empire.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  So they set about turning America into a high-tech police state, brainwashing the public.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  And because if you want a world empire, you can't just have an external empire.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  You've got to control your domestic slaves.
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  And that's what this is, and we are just used basically as a mercenary force to pay taxes,
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  to create the armies and to levy the taxes to fund the armies.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  And we are the most conquered here of anybody in the global empire.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  We are the conquered.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  A very shallow, dumb-down public that can't look any further than the end of their nose.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  And so we're in a lot of trouble.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  But I did make some notes here in this memo.
[05:08.000 --> 05:15.000]  We'll go over that, the shape of things to come, things present.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  We have a completely ruthless group of people in control
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  who will think nothing of staging terror attacks in the United States.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  It's all part of the military mind.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  So what, just more death, huh?
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  It gets the job done, gets the mission done.
[05:27.000 --> 05:39.000]  Let's get the mission destroyed, America.
[05:58.000 --> 06:04.000]  That's why there's Puraclear from Ripple Creek.
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  Puraclear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid.
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  Among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[06:14.000 --> 06:19.000]  Puraclear also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  Puraclear now by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363 or go to RippleCreek.com.
[06:30.000 --> 06:36.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[06:46.000 --> 06:55.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the ATD made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  If we don't expose the government's sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  Big Brother.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  Even mainstream media is reporting that it was Anglo's predominantly carrying out the
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  commando attacks across the financial capital of India in the last two-and-a-half days.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  Paul Watson has been detailing this as well as Kurt Nemo. Paul Watson will be joining us in about
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  seven minutes from now.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  For the balance of the hour, it is Friday, ladies and gentlemen. We are live.
[09:18.000 --> 09:25.000]  I was going to take off the day from radio to finish up my studio that, for all intents and purposes, is done.
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  And so in the next few weeks, we'll be doing art shows from the new studio, just a program note for everybody.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  And it's got a great new look for all the prisonplanet.org.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  And it's got a great new look for all the prisonplanet.tv members with the TV show we're going to be doing in there.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  I'll probably just do the new international television program I'm going to be doing out of that studio as well.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  It looks that good. So just wait and see. We're pretty excited about it.
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  Here's some of the other news. Fox News reports on collapse of Building 7 before it happens.
[10:03.000 --> 10:11.000]  You know, we have CNN saying 45 minutes before the Building 7 had fallen because of structural damage in its own footprint
[10:11.000 --> 10:19.000]  with a total collapse, putting out the official story. We had BBC 25 minutes before on BBC World and BBC 24,
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  two separate channels saying the exact same scripted lines as CNN.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  And so we went on air and said, ladies and gentlemen, and it took years. It was years after 9-11 that these tapes were discovered
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  and aired live by 9-11 researchers.
[10:36.000 --> 10:44.000]  And we said, you know, clearly Reuters or AP put out an internal wire, which they do, to the news agencies
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  reporting that earlier as part of the official story to make sure that they put out the official story when they blew it up.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  And then BBC denied that and said we were liars and said they'd lost the tapes and said that it wasn't even true.
[10:57.000 --> 11:05.000]  It wasn't even basically a real video. Then they had to back off and say, OK, we found the tapes. It is true.
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.000]  And yes, Reuters sent them an internal memo reporting that. See, exactly as we said, we know how the world works.
[11:13.000 --> 11:23.000]  This is what we do. We study enemy operations. We're just desperate groups of people desperately trying to defend
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  what's left of liberty, studying the enemies of freedom, studying the globalist crime syndicate.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  And that's why we're right about everything. I mean, and I'm not tooting my horn here.
[11:34.000 --> 11:40.000]  It's horrifying that we're right. It's horrifying that things, folks, I couldn't even sleep last night.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  I rolled around every 20, 30 minutes waking up staring at the clock on the wall.
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  Just so upset about what's happening, so upset about what the next phases of the New World Order are,
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  so upset that I've been right about everything, so upset that we assess things correctly.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  I mean, I look at my innocent children every day and I want to break down crying just out of sadness for them and humanity.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  And I look at the dumbed-down public. I don't hate them for their ignorance. I feel sorry for them.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  You know, this morning in Long Island, a Walmart opened and the man opening the front door was trampled to death.
[12:22.000 --> 12:31.000]  And as he laid there bleeding to death on the floor, after more than 500 people had run over him stomping on him,
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  no one stopped him helping. And that's what's happening to America.
[12:37.000 --> 12:45.000]  When the CPS takes somebody's small child for no reason and take them for medical experiments or take them to adopt them out to a home,
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  to a family for money, or when somebody dies of cancer from fluoride and water,
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  or somebody dies at a young age from cancer viruses and the vaccines,
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  or when troops get nerve-gassed and chemical-tested by our own criminal government,
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  it just, it'll come out in the news and nothing happens.
[13:03.000 --> 13:11.000]  Or when American citizens are grabbed and flown overseas to be tortured, it comes out and nobody gets in trouble.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  And I read every week about somebody in a major thoroughfare run over by a car bleeding to death for an hour,
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  or a child being beaten to death by some schizophrenic psycho on the side of the road and hundreds of cars pass and nobody stops to help.
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  They just call 911.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  The member of the British government, a conservative member of parliament,
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  who put out information about government corruption that was confirmed to be accurate,
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  was arrested by anti-terror forces of the British government.
[13:48.000 --> 13:56.000]  And there's members of parliament, the mayor of London is calling for his release,
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  and they're using anti-terror powers on the general public over there and over here,
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  because this entire anti-terror apparatus is for us.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  Do you understand that? North com is for us.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  I mean, how did I know about all this a decade before it became mainstream news?
[14:15.000 --> 14:22.000]  Because I went to urban warfare drills and witnessed our military training to take our guns and saying it was for the United States.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  That's high treason.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  I don't care if they brainwash the military and tell them it's not.
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  I don't care if Secretary of Defense Gates says it's okay.
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  I mean, they say it's okay that four plus trillion dollars has been stolen out of the Pentagon pension funds,
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  and they tell Congress that they're not allowed to investigate.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  You're not above Congress.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  Bloomberg reported two days ago that it's 7.8 trillion.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  Two weeks ago, it was 5 trillion.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  They're stealing a trillion bucks a week, folks, in the open, AP Reuters.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  They don't care. They're going for broke.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  North com standing by.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  They're deploying regular army to the United States, and it's just creeping death.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  It's just expanding all around us.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  I have videos in front of me and a woman,
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  50-something years old, no criminal record. Somebody was sitting in her seat,
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  so she was sitting in the seat next to it.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  The cops come in and they say, we're ejecting you.
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  They grab her, drag her out, throw her on the ground, and on video, she's not resisting, and they taser her.
[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  They're being trained to attack us, trained to bully us, trained to be enemies of the people.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  The military is, as well.
[15:48.000 --> 15:57.000]  Any excuse to attack us, any excuse to go after us, we have a rogue criminal government.
[15:57.000 --> 16:06.000]  Now, after Paul Watson leaves us, I'm going to get into memorandum for secretaries of the military departments,
[16:06.000 --> 16:19.000]  document number OSD 13259-08, signed and delivered to every command and every sub-command in the military,
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  November 24, 2008.
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.000]  Now, CBS News on the 24th ran the headline military examines role in domestic defense
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  and says that troops will be used on the streets of America.
[16:31.000 --> 16:40.000]  But it's even worse than that. This codifies into official policy the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.000]  to abolish the governors and emergencies and to abolish the National Guard,
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  and to make standing Northcom troops part of our daily lives.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  It's all in here, and it's in the military times, in the Army times, in the Air Force times.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  It's posted everywhere. We have it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:12.000]  You can link through. You'll be on the Pentagon's own website reading OSD 13259-08.
[17:12.000 --> 17:21.000]  So, you know what I'm sick of? Watching all the covert preparation for this for 13 years on air,
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  it's the denial of the public.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  Or the public goes, what's wrong with having a military on our streets?
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  Why didn't we have that before? Why is our whole government set up to defend against that?
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  That's why we have states. That's why they're sovereign.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  Have you read what the founding fathers said about this?
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  Communist China has a standing army domestically. Russia has one.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  Venezuela has one. Cuba has one.
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  But if you study the attack profile of this, it's worse than those forces.
[17:55.000 --> 18:04.000]  More egregious historically. This is the military designed and set up to attack the American people.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  Openly.
[18:06.000 --> 18:13.000]  Then I have a stack of news about Defense Intelligence and the National Reconnaissance Office and others
[18:13.000 --> 18:20.000]  with local police spying on the American people all over the United States.
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.000]  Defense Intelligence is in every town and city, folks. They're shipping in the cocaine, the heroin.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  It's disgusting. And what is infrastructure protection? It's ensuring more people go to prison,
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  more checkpoints, more cameras, more regulations, more taxes, and these offshore corporations control our Pentagon.
[18:38.000 --> 18:45.000]  They take the money out of the United States. They put it into multinational corporations.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  The military is there to stand guard against the Congress and the American people
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  to make sure the looting and the stealing goes unabated.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  Now, $7.8 trillion has been stolen in six weeks.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  Bloomberg, AP. $7.8 trillion.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  $4 trillion has been stolen in the last ten years out of the Pentagon pension funds.
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  They've taken the fire department funds. They've taken the school funds, retirement funds.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  They've taken the police retirement funds. They've taken the state worker funds.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  And when you find out about it and you try to go out and take the government back,
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  they're going to gun you and your family down. And they're going to go to people's houses door to door.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  They're going to take people like me and they're going to put me on a C-130 chained up for two or three days.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  They're going to take me to a third world country to give me an acid bath.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  And they've built these acid bath facilities all over the world.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  Folks, I'm not joking about this, okay? They're going to steal everything.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  They're rogue. They're criminal.
[19:47.000 --> 19:54.000]  If Dying Corps will set up airports with 200,000 women and children kidnapped a year and fly them out,
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  that's industrial size. That's massive.
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.000]  They'll do that there. They'll do that here.
[20:02.000 --> 20:06.000]  Well, I'm not going to any acid bath.
[20:06.000 --> 20:11.000]  And I'm not going to let some big fat jail guard, they hired for Homeland Security, take me away.
[20:11.000 --> 20:17.000]  I'm not going anywhere with you murdering pieces of anti-American traitorous filth.
[20:17.000 --> 20:23.000]  You got it? You got it? We're going to stand up against you and we're going to kick your butt.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  You know how we're going to do it? We're going to warn the people that you're really the terrorist.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  And we're going to expose you and you're already losing.

[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  How about surprising your loved ones with a gift they can use every day of the year?

[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[21:45.000 --> 21:52.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  The headlines are clear. The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  The market of beast is at hand.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  The Pentagon was seized by the new owner a long time ago.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  They're running operations against us like we're an occupied country.
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  Their propaganda is everywhere. They must be identified.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  They must be exposed. We must take control of the military, the executive, the legislative.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  It is our right. It is our duty.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  The balance of the hour, I'm going to talk to Paul Watson about what really happened over in India.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  And coming up in the next hour, I'll get into what Secretary of Defense Gates is up to.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  And this unbelievable information. Again, we are live. It is Friday the 28th of the day.
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.000]  Of November 2008. Mubai gunmen included Britons. That's being reported by mainstream news.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson from the United Kingdom.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Who's been tracking this for the last two and a half days and writing detailed articles.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  Paul, give us the latest. Break down what's really happened.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  Hello Alex. Good to be back.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  Good to have you here.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  Yeah, I was watching this unfold when it started a couple of days ago.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  Obviously the first thing that happened when there was still confusion about exactly what was happening
[25:50.000 --> 26:00.000]  and who was responsible within about an hour of the first reports after it went big on the mainstream news networks.
[26:00.000 --> 26:07.000]  BBC Fox News were already saying that it was Al Qaeda.
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  That it was another massively orchestrated Al Qaeda plot directed against the West.
[26:14.000 --> 26:23.000]  Which, you know, whenever anything happens, you know, last summer if two retards set fire to a jeep at Glasgow airport
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  and injure only themselves, then it's a deadly massive Al Qaeda plot.
[26:28.000 --> 26:36.000]  You know, if somebody fakes a beheading with tomato ketchup, then the media instantly laps it up and says it's a massive Al Qaeda plot.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  So that's what they were doing immediately after these attacks started to unfold,
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  despite the fact that nobody really had a clear sense of what was going on.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  And the evidence they cited to make the claim that it was Al Qaeda,
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  and for Al Qaeda, of course, you could substitute Al Qaeda, but whichever.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  They said the claims were coordinated and that was it.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  That was the sole basis on which they said it was directed by Osama bin Laden.
[27:07.000 --> 27:14.000]  So because these terrorists had the sophistication to pick up a calendar and select a date,
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  that's now proof of sophistication and expert planning, and it's proof that Al Qaeda did it.
[27:20.000 --> 27:31.000]  And they're still saying today you've got David Milibander, the UK Foreign Secretary, saying it's probably Al Qaeda.
[27:31.000 --> 27:39.000]  You've got terrorism experts on the BBC saying, quote, the attacks bear all the hallmarks of Al Qaeda.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  Certainly those attackers were inspired by Al Qaeda methodology.
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  You know, what methodology? Choosing a date on a calendar.
[27:49.000 --> 27:58.000]  As some people have said, and it's broken through in the mainstream media, these attacks had none of the hallmarks of Al Qaeda.
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.000]  By the way, day one when this whole started Wednesday, you said that they would end up blaming it on Pakistan,
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  and the Indian government did do that, but now Indian papers, Irish papers, British papers, French papers are reporting
[28:12.000 --> 28:20.000]  that the gunmen included Britons, and they tried to shut down Twitter and other network internet systems,
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.000]  people communicating because Westerners and others were reporting that it was blonde-haired blue-eyed people
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  in black uniforms running around machine gunning and hangernading the crowds.
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  Well, that's certainly interesting, and they definitely locked down the information on it.
[28:36.000 --> 28:45.000]  But what I get from that is that there were some Kashmiris involved, and if you look at it,
[28:45.000 --> 28:54.000]  Kashmiris have lighter skin, a lot lighter skin than Indians, because Alexander the Great invaded that area.
[28:54.000 --> 29:02.000]  That's right, the upper caste is white in India, and that's the upper caste predominant area where a lot of the upper caste
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.000]  live and historically come from, but expanding that, just a year ago you had what, 2,000 Muslims killed nearby
[29:09.000 --> 29:16.000]  by the radical Hindu groups, so there is evidence, and most of it, as we said day one, points towards,
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  this is payback for that, and every few months we hear about mass shootings and killings by both sides.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  So the question is, why are they trying to build this as an Al-CIA to attack?
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  Now Indian papers are saying, if that's the case, ISI, CIA, and the shod have classically been in control
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  of the Pakistani militant groups, that's even admitted.
[29:37.000 --> 29:44.000]  Right. I mean, my take on it is, if it was American and British S.A.S. or whatever,
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  they wouldn't be walking around taking hostages and being identified.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  You know, those S.A.S. soldiers in Iraq who were caught staging the bombings were at least dressed up as Arabs,
[29:54.000 --> 30:00.000]  so as you said, it's a different group that's behind it, but again, the media is not telling the truth
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  on who is behind it and the reasons why it's happening.
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.000]  Yeah, well the reports are, as you'll have, clean cut guys, you know, but with punk rock hairdos
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.000]  and they just walk out of restaurants and start blasting everybody.
[30:13.000 --> 30:20.000]  Paul Watson, stay there. Let's walk through it all. When we get back, stay with us.
[30:20.000 --> 30:30.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:45.360 --> 33:51.360]  Evidence, attacks for Anglo-American intel operatives,
[33:51.360 --> 33:55.840]  media force to backtrack on Al Qaeda link to attacks in India,
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.200]  attacks blamed on Al Qaeda as pretext for U.S. military response,
[34:04.640 --> 34:08.720]  and then of course they had their own hyping of, oh we've got to have more checkpoints from
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.560]  Boston to Dallas at the train stations because Al Qaeda is about to strike on Thanksgiving.
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.960]  If you go back to the White House admitted four years ago they put out fake terror alerts and
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.520]  so many people, you know, were hoping that Barack Obama would reverse all this instead
[34:23.520 --> 34:27.360]  he just gives the criminals in control of the government a new lease on life
[34:27.360 --> 34:31.440]  to con a new group of people to go along with the system again.
[34:33.360 --> 34:35.920]  I mean if you look at his cabinet that's a whole other story now.
[34:35.920 --> 34:42.640]  Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates, the list goes on and on, remember Rush Limbaugh said don't vote
[34:42.640 --> 34:48.320]  for Ron Paul, support Hillary because then McCain can beat Hillary but the polls actually
[34:48.320 --> 34:52.000]  showed that Hillary would have probably won by even greater numbers than Barack Obama.
[34:52.640 --> 34:58.000]  Ah you got suckered again by the fake neocons. Paul Watson continued breaking this down but
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.640]  for those that don't know, break down exactly what happened in India with the attacks all over
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.440]  their major financial center. Go through in a chronological order and then give us the latest.
[35:08.880 --> 35:15.200]  Well what happened was that reportedly these terrorists arrived on the boats
[35:15.200 --> 35:21.760]  which came into the harbor there with rucksacks and heavily armed and they fanned out into the
[35:21.760 --> 35:30.480]  different areas of Mumbai including a train, subway station, a restaurant and these two
[35:30.480 --> 35:41.200]  major hotels and they started indiscriminately which is the key word firing upon innocent victims.
[35:41.200 --> 35:49.520]  Now when it started unfolding in the media the terror experts were wheeled out to say
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.720]  that it had all the hallmarks of an Al Qaeda operation, that was a direct quote from the
[35:54.720 --> 36:00.000]  London Times article, when it had none of the hallmarks it was not a suicide bombing,
[36:00.720 --> 36:04.800]  you know they were using grenades and AK-47s, they were taking hostages.
[36:04.800 --> 36:12.080]  In all of the previous quote Al Qaeda attacks substitute Al Qaeda for Al Ciaida because that's
[36:12.080 --> 36:20.480]  who runs it, none of those things happen. So then you get these reports that they've taken
[36:20.480 --> 36:30.240]  hostages and that the attacks are targeted against American and British citizens. Now
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.120]  they've just announced that two Americans have died and they previously announced that
[36:36.480 --> 36:44.000]  one British citizen had been killed but the fact is that out of 150 dead there's one British guy
[36:44.560 --> 36:51.440]  who was born in Cyprus, he had a British passport and there's now two Americans they're saying
[36:51.440 --> 36:56.480]  and well over a hundred Indians that are dead, you know they walked out into the train
[36:56.480 --> 37:03.040]  subway station started firing on people indiscriminately. Absolutely this city is a huge
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.080]  tourist area, there are huge hotels you name it full of Westerners and in restaurants they
[37:08.080 --> 37:13.760]  would have wanted to go after them, there they could have. The evidence right now is fitting
[37:13.760 --> 37:20.240]  towards this being that particular quote Indian Mujahideen group who by the way have taken
[37:20.240 --> 37:27.200]  responsibility and the media's ignored that as a tit for tat for the last massacre of more than
[37:27.200 --> 37:35.440]  2,000 Muslims at the hands of a Hindus. Right and these are exactly what was described as these
[37:35.440 --> 37:41.680]  young kids in their early 20s who were mostly Indian Muslims with some Kashmiris and Bangladeshis
[37:42.720 --> 37:48.160]  and basically it's a domestic issue, it has nothing to do with an attack on the West.
[37:48.160 --> 37:52.320]  It's tribal, you know I mean all the evidence is pointing towards tribal warfare
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.680]  which you know you should do an article Paul just showing the last five years the hundreds of cases
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.800]  where sometimes you'll have 500, 600, 800, a thousand dead and again I'm not getting in between
[38:02.800 --> 38:09.360]  the Muslims and the Hindus here but the sect that killed the 2,000 Muslims recently in India
[38:09.360 --> 38:14.880]  that's the same sect that killed Mahatma Gandhi because he wouldn't get behind their group
[38:14.880 --> 38:22.160]  exterminating Muslims so this is the same group that killed Gandhi because he wouldn't go along
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.880]  with them and then for a few months even then they tried to blame it on the Muslims when they
[38:26.880 --> 38:36.000]  killed Gandhi. Right and you had the 700 Muslims killed in the riots in 2002 you got the Indian
[38:36.000 --> 38:45.360]  government bombing Muslim mosques you've got Indian controlled Kashmir where there are false arrests
[38:45.360 --> 38:51.920]  the women are getting raped it's like you know it's like the Israeli occupation of Gaza basically
[38:52.480 --> 38:58.560]  so yes there is a motive for them to do this kind of thing and it's that you had the claim from
[38:58.560 --> 39:05.840]  Deccan Mujahideen which is probably an affiliate of the Indian Mujahideen but then as I predict
[39:05.840 --> 39:13.280]  it in the first article that I wrote about this on Wednesday night the Indian government is now
[39:13.280 --> 39:22.160]  officially blaming Pakistan and saying that the ISI linked group Lashkar-e-Toyba which always
[39:22.800 --> 39:28.720]  claims responsibility for its attacks but in this case has vehemently denied responsibility
[39:29.360 --> 39:34.240]  they're saying that they're likely responsible so you have to ask yourself
[39:34.240 --> 39:42.480]  what on earth would Pakistan gain from sponsoring these armed thugs to go on an indiscriminate
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.720]  rampage which is played out on international television yeah the way this works when all
[39:46.720 --> 39:52.080]  this happens everybody tunes in and hears al-Qaeda struck killed people in shopping malls and train
[39:52.080 --> 39:57.360]  stations they may strike America credible threats they're in America they're going to attack on
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.720]  Thanksgiving they're going to kill Americans it's over give up all your rights only homeland
[40:02.720 --> 40:10.880]  security can save you and then days later after it subsides it comes out that it was most probably
[40:10.880 --> 40:16.560]  all the evidence points are i'd say 90 percent certain tribal warfare one of many events and
[40:16.560 --> 40:24.080]  so the media here just seized on it as a pretext to escalate tensions with Pakistan on the eve
[40:24.080 --> 40:31.520]  of barack obama entering office is promised to go into pakistan exactly and i mean india gets bombed
[40:31.520 --> 40:38.080]  every month in fact i'm surprised every time i read about a bombing or a mass shooting in india
[40:38.080 --> 40:44.720]  that kills you know 40 50 people it's not it never gets any headlines in the western media
[40:44.720 --> 40:49.440]  and suddenly they've seized upon this which admittedly is on a bigger scale but it's it's
[40:49.440 --> 40:55.040]  the same thing it's a domestic issue it's tribal warfare well it is on a big bigger scale than
[40:55.040 --> 41:01.440]  some of the smaller ones but i mean i've seen them with 2000 dead but again that's Muslims being
[41:01.440 --> 41:08.320]  killed so that's okay yeah well that there was a 164 or whatever killed two years ago in a train
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.680]  bombing by the indian mojahedin i mean it got nothing like the headlines of this is game
[41:14.800 --> 41:21.280]  so again it's as you said it's all being tied into pakistan you had the bombing raids inside
[41:21.280 --> 41:27.280]  pakistan which is you know killed women and children highly unpopular and now they've
[41:27.280 --> 41:33.360]  got the perfect pretext to it expand that and then you've got obviously the link to afghanistan
[41:33.360 --> 41:39.200]  with them saying that it's all all the Taliban again all the support from the border and that's
[41:39.200 --> 41:46.880]  another perfect pretext to continue the military occupation of afghanistan meanwhile both nations
[41:46.880 --> 41:59.120]  pakistan and india have nukes exactly and they nearly went to war in 2002 after the isi sponsored
[41:59.120 --> 42:08.080]  in that case bombed of the indian parliament but in this case both the lashkari toyba and the pakistan
[42:08.080 --> 42:13.280]  government are vehemently saying they've got nothing to do with it and in fact the the top isi
[42:13.280 --> 42:19.280]  officials are now on the way to india to prostrate themselves in front of the indian government
[42:19.280 --> 42:24.400]  because you know they know what's coming if it gets linked to them which is uh that's right
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.840]  clearly pakistan has fallen out of favor with the new world order their puppet mashara after eight
[42:29.840 --> 42:35.920]  years in power got kicked out uh budo shot her mouth off but it appeared was being sent in by
[42:35.920 --> 42:41.280]  british intelligence she got killed machine gunned on video and they told our mindless public that
[42:41.280 --> 42:47.120]  she hit her head on the car i mean that's how dumb they think we are folks that that she was on
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.720]  tv being shot and then they tell us that she hit her head uh all over the foreign press they didn't
[42:52.720 --> 42:57.840]  even dare say that it's just only here with the mindless public there's such an insult to our
[42:57.840 --> 43:02.960]  intelligence ladies and gentlemen uh it's very murky what's going on over there uh paul but what
[43:02.960 --> 43:10.640]  what from your research uh overall the bigger picture in central asia where do you see it going
[43:12.240 --> 43:18.800]  i think the big bigger picture is to as you said pakistan fell out of favor it's more of a
[43:18.800 --> 43:23.520]  democracy now than it was under mashara for their lives because they could manipulate them easily
[43:24.240 --> 43:30.400]  and now it's going to put a lot of pressure on pakistan to integrate more into the new world
[43:30.400 --> 43:39.840]  order in 2002 when they nearly went to war it came out and this was in my book i put it in order
[43:39.840 --> 43:46.720]  out of chaos that the american and british um military industrial complex and the weapons
[43:46.720 --> 43:53.120]  manufacturers were arming both sides they were arming both pakistan and india as the tensions
[43:53.120 --> 43:57.760]  built up and it was very lucrative for them and it nearly kicked started a nuclear war
[43:57.760 --> 44:04.480]  so i mean that's a financial motive right there and as he said pakistan have fell out of favor
[44:04.480 --> 44:09.920]  so they want to get them back in line and now you've got pakistan prostrating themselves saying
[44:09.920 --> 44:15.520]  we have nothing to do with this as the indian military and government leaders accuse pakistan
[44:15.520 --> 44:22.640]  of having a direct hand in it well the biggest issue here is you're right every month things
[44:22.640 --> 44:28.640]  like this happen in india why was this given so much attention now why was it coordinated with
[44:28.640 --> 44:35.040]  the western intelligence saying big event big al-qaeda spectacular uh then chartoff coming
[44:35.040 --> 44:41.760]  on saying this is an al-qaeda spectacular when uh very low probability that this would be al-qaeda
[44:41.760 --> 44:50.160]  if it was al-qaeda even mainline press reports it's controlled by pakistani isi which is controlled by
[44:50.160 --> 45:01.840]  cia mi6 and massad and so right there you know either way you cut it what we're here saying
[45:01.840 --> 45:07.920]  but this probably doesn't have western fingerprints on it but but even when the west isn't provocaturing
[45:07.920 --> 45:15.440]  it uh or staging it or funding it or allowing it to happen they just take a real event which is
[45:15.440 --> 45:21.120]  ongoing with the billion 300 billion people in india and they're constantly killing each other just
[45:21.120 --> 45:26.080]  like in africa you got christians and muslims and christians and animus and everybody running around
[45:26.080 --> 45:37.760]  killing each other exactly and now you've got um the massad news from debka file saying that the
[45:37.760 --> 45:45.920]  terrorist failed on a boat from carachi sponsored by pakistan and uh you obviously got the hostage
[45:45.920 --> 45:51.440]  situation in the jewish center which is still ongoing so there you've got israel hyping it
[45:51.440 --> 45:57.920]  as well as as another reason um to expand their military adventurism and who even knows what
[45:57.920 --> 46:03.200]  that is they've clamped down the info for two and a half days that could be staged that could be real
[46:03.200 --> 46:10.560]  certainly the muslims over in india are no fan of the local uh synagogues well what's interesting
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.440]  is that the first thing the indian government said about they were asked are there any hostages
[46:15.440 --> 46:21.440]  they said no there's none whatsoever and now it's been dragging on for three days who knows what's
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.800]  going on i mean they could be firing at each other because they've been at first this morning they
[46:26.800 --> 46:33.440]  said the Taj Mahal was a done deal that they completely cleared it and now they're firing at
[46:33.440 --> 46:41.520]  it again and throwing grenades at it so who knows what's going on well we know the russians staged
[46:41.520 --> 46:46.960]  and then killed the reporters that tried to break it whole string of them staged takeovers of schools
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.120]  and theaters and how that works as you have your commandos dressed like terrorists they go in they
[46:51.120 --> 46:55.280]  release knockout gas then run out the back door and the army lets them escape then they grab a
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.640]  patsy put them on the news then you know a year later it comes out it was staged uh so
[47:02.400 --> 47:06.080]  you know the fbi and homeland security said they want metal detectors on street corners
[47:06.080 --> 47:12.000]  metal detectors at malls i think it's in the cards forum to let a real militant group in
[47:12.000 --> 47:17.120]  because they do exist there are real terrorist folks uh into the united states just like in 93
[47:17.120 --> 47:23.760]  where they went and found the blind cleric uh radical saying kill kill kill you know the infidel
[47:23.760 --> 47:29.040]  they literally found two guys they'd assessed on city welfare low grade morons both borderline
[47:29.040 --> 47:35.920]  retarded um both of them below 80 iqs and it took them uh months and months to to build the bomb
[47:35.920 --> 47:40.000]  train them give it to them and then the guy to build the bomb for him hired by the u.s government
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.440]  came out and said okay let's bust them and they said no we let the bombing go forward so he knew
[47:43.440 --> 47:50.080]  he was being set up and he so he recorded the fbi saying we're gonna let the bombing go forward
[47:50.080 --> 47:55.280]  and that's why we leave oh by the way this week paul as you know the germans got caught and this
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.600]  is in reuters this is confirmed staging terror attacks he wrote a story at prisonplanet.com
[48:01.600 --> 48:07.920]  about that and then there was some other cases of nato being caught uh trying to attack uh
[48:07.920 --> 48:15.200]  polish diplomats uh and even the polish government says that that was staged uh we've had uh people
[48:15.200 --> 48:23.840]  being assassinated uh in uh georgia uh as part of un slash nato convoy turns out georgia staged
[48:23.840 --> 48:29.360]  that and that is an alec jones or paul watson saying all this three different this is mainstream news
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.560]  saying it's staged so the that's very strange to see the mainstream media telling the truth looks
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.520]  like they're losing control of these operations but where it shows how government media compartmentalized
[48:39.520 --> 48:45.120]  most people in the army or in the fbi or in reuters you know they're not evil operatives they're
[48:45.120 --> 48:52.000]  just compartmentalized paul tell them about the germans yeah that was an EU mission in kosovo
[48:52.720 --> 48:59.520]  the uh kosovan government had just rejected a proposal to have the EU basically take over
[48:59.520 --> 49:08.320]  their entire police force and government and uh then at four days later you had two what turned
[49:08.320 --> 49:18.320]  out to be german bnd intelligence agents who threw grenades at this uh EU mission building in kosovo
[49:18.320 --> 49:24.880]  and the other reports that they also planted a bomb next to it and uh they were caught and they were
[49:24.880 --> 49:32.080]  identified by german newspapers as german intelligence bnd agents so obviously they were
[49:32.080 --> 49:38.080]  they were trying to elicit an agenda for the EU to come in and say you know it's unstable we need to
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.880]  take over which you know they were attacking their own building now for those that don't know when we
[49:42.880 --> 49:49.920]  say israel stages terror as well israeli newspapers report that there's fake al qaeda and that more
[49:49.920 --> 49:55.200]  than two-thirds of the bombings in israel are staged i mean for listeners out there who are
[49:55.200 --> 50:01.440]  new listeners this is not our opinion roiders there's spiegel they're all reporting the germans
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.800]  got caught bombing and shooting their own building paul not for the first time either
[50:06.800 --> 50:13.440]  if you think about what happened at the Reichstag but then you then you've got got to look at the
[50:13.440 --> 50:21.440]  fact that in certain regions of the world for reasons of revenge and atrocities that are
[50:21.440 --> 50:26.080]  carried out against them and there's atrocities on both sides which is the case with muslims and
[50:26.080 --> 50:35.680]  hindus indian muslims and hindus there are real organic terrorist groups but the what you have
[50:35.680 --> 50:41.520]  to know is how the attacks are exploited by the government's in question in the media they use
[50:41.520 --> 50:47.120]  al qaeda as a catchall term for any muslim group in the world that engages in in in asymmetrical
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.120]  low intensity combat and this is i mean this is the classic thing just like we saw uh in north
[50:53.120 --> 50:58.480]  africa with the french and and and when they were being thrown out uh really you know running around
[50:58.480 --> 51:06.240]  the street shooting people that's what these real fighters do but they say it's al qaeda so it puts
[51:06.240 --> 51:11.040]  the fear of god into americans so they can show authority figures pointing guns at people at
[51:11.040 --> 51:18.000]  checkpoints and then say the subways about to be attacked give up your eyes paul wants to stay there
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.960]  i want to talk about uk government using police to arrest political adversaries uk daily mail

[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:06.000]  the terror attacks that appear to be sectarian tribal religious warfare between muslim and
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:11.840]  hindi groups that are constantly killing each other in mass not a l c i a to attack if it was
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.320]  an al-qaeda attack that would then be pakistani intelligence but because she pakistani intelligence
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:23.280]  it appears is going out of the hands of new world order control they've fallen out of favor
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.720]  and that's why barack obama wants to invade the country that has nukes by the way um we're
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:32.880]  finishing up with paul for stations that just joined us uk government using police to arrest
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:39.360]  political adversaries they've arrested a minister a government minister over immigration because he
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:44.080]  leaked to the press remember came out like four years ago the tony blare allowed hundreds of
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:51.200]  thousands of illegal aliens in and secret deals with the e u well this was thousands of individuals
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:57.600]  who were illegal aliens to be in high power intelligence positions again they use foreigners
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:04.160]  like ugandan and uh... you know venezuelan and nicaragua and also the door and death squad
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:09.280]  former death squads in iraq uh... over our own troops at the bases will sustain thing there
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:16.000]  in england and and again you have the leader of the conservative party coming out david cameron
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:24.400]  saying stalin s police state uh... i mean this is this is outrageous paul it is but it's it's no
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:30.800]  surprise you know from what i mean for every day that blare was in office and now brown
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:37.040]  a new law was created which takes the rights away of british citizens and they're using that
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:41.680]  in that new terrorism detention what's up to fifty something days now where they can grab anybody
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:47.520]  and not even say they grabbed you oh yeah exactly and they did the foundation on which they do it
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:53.680]  i mean you had a woman reading it the london independent which is a mainstream newspaper
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:03:00.080]  one of the best-selling and it had a mildly anti-war headline on the front page and she
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:07.360]  was reading the story and she was questioned under the anti-terror powers for reading the story
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:13.760]  and i know she was she was arrested paul was she arrested she was she was taken into custody yes
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:20.640]  so there you go i mean that's how they're using these anti-terror powers to spy on the public
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:26.160]  basically the level that's what homeland security is for and you got the same thing over there they
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:32.880]  are now announcing that yes the military homeland security is to go after the states the governors
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:38.080]  the people they are openly turning the military against us paul well how could they be for anything
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:44.320]  else if they're real terrorists running around in america then it'd be like india and israel
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:48.800]  could be bombings every month but there isn't any real terrorists which is why you only get
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:54.880]  one mass casualty event every every five six seven years because the mass casualty events
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:04:01.520]  the stage so there's no terrorist then who do the powers get focused on it you just said the key
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:06.800]  there on average every seven years they bomb us with a staged event to create the illusion that
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:12.400]  it's real oklahoma city first world trade center attack the last world trade center attack i believe
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:18.640]  we're going to have a inaugural terrorism staged by the black ops so that obama can be our savior
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:27.520]  but they've promised it they joe biden guaranteed it it's not like it was a hint i mean the outright
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:32.400]  came out and said yes i guarantee i promise it's going to happen that there's going to be this
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:37.120]  international crisis that obama has to deal with and it could be something that happened in the
[1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:43.040]  u.s or it could be an escalation of uh... you know a nuclear conflict with pakistan and india
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:49.600]  or any other country but guaranteed that he's going to be faced with this quote crisis to
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:55.600]  rally the nation around him well we're we're one month twenty four days away from this fall
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:04.720]  exactly and what it could be we can't guess at the moment but you know if it's terrorism i still
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:10.000]  believe they'd like to play that schwarz the nega card and have something off in california
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.640]  because it'd be too tempting for them not to but if it's not that it's going to be some geopolitical
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:20.800]  crisis as is guaranteed all right paul wants to continue to watch your great analysis uh there

[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:23.040]  attack you because i understand the psychological warfare experts that have set all this up
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:30.240]  up they understand that compacts you more into your gang culture the more you get
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:32.800]  attacked the more you feel like you're under attack the more you
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:40.560]  retreat into your thin black line your thin blue line i just want to say this
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:48.400]  things are out of control corruption is breeding everywhere the government has gone bad it's been
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:54.560]  totally bought off and they've stolen 7.8 trillion in six weeks that's every major news article
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:59.840]  you know we've got them all posted up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com bloomberg ap
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:07.680]  Reuters and uh you know bush just said i'm giving another 800 billion to congress i mean without
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:14.560]  congress's authority another 800 billion and why is bush saying that because the bill congress passed
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:22.000]  six weeks ago said treasury and the private federal reserve cannot be investigated cannot be
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:27.520]  audited cannot be reviewed by any court by any law enforcement group that they're above the law
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:31.920]  and then alan greenspan went on tv on lair news hour and said we're above the law already
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:39.920]  now on its face that's a fraud it's illegitimate and it appears they decided it well doesn't
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:46.560]  appear it's conclusive to completely go for broke that they just don't care and they're going for
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:51.200]  broke and when you know when i get up here and i tell you that they've already stolen most of your
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:56.800]  pension funds you know your cities your counties your states invested in these offshore corporations
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:02.720]  these offshore uh stocks and bonds and these brokerage firms it's all gone by all gone about
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  70 percent of it's gone and they're stealing the rest of it right now they took the real assets
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:15.600]  and they bought up infrastructure roads shipping firms media companies defense contractors agribusiness
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:22.320]  gmo this is why the power leader in control they care about the world and how it works
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:28.240]  they care about power they care about being in control they want to dominate they enjoy
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:33.840]  doing things like this we're being militarily dominated by homeland security they've they've
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:38.800]  got us stuck up you know they've got us with a gun to our head up against the wall spread eagle
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.160]  while the bankers walk in and steal everything out of the treasury
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:49.920]  it's a better analogy to say a better a better parallel to say they run up our credit cards
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:54.400]  because we got to pay for all this we have to pay all this back and i've got all these news
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:12:00.160]  articles about taxes going up regulations going up police writing more tickets to raise more money
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:05.760]  how they're going to start having just these property tax assessments it doesn't matter
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:10.080]  if your house value goes down they'll just assess you 10 20 30 40 thousand dollars a year
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:17.440]  they're going to squeeze us and that's what the paramilitary police in north com are for
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:25.360]  and they're now saying that now i read declassified documents when i was first waking up 15 years
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:30.800]  ago or so or they were planning all this and and and so i'd go on air and i'd warn people
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:34.320]  as they built it as they set it up as they expanded it
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:41.040]  and now it's going from a cold war against the people to a hot war
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:49.840]  a hot war and whether you're in the military a police officer whatever you are
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:56.720]  you know the state department protective detail state department security that's had fun harassing us
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:03.680]  for no reason defense intelligence i have stacks of news today where they're spying on churches
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:09.440]  they're spying on school groups they're spying on mainline veterans for peace with no history of
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:15.520]  violence you have the history of violence your rogue you work for the private groups that have
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:23.200]  seized our government and i at least want you to publicly be aware of what's happening and
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.800]  be put on notice because i know you listen and i want you to consciously make the decision
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:32.560]  whether you're going to be with the people or with the elites because the elites are acting
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.080]  very unstable you know they're focused they're intelligent it's all planned out but still
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:44.400]  their plan is diabolical and is nuts and i don't see you getting away with it i mean
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:48.400]  i mean you've stolen almost eight trillion dollars in uh
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:58.160]  just a month a month and two weeks i mean well what's coming next
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:02.880]  and then the cps business 1.4 million children
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:11.360]  grabbed every year in fact john you read me back only one clip there were two clips one of the
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.320]  clips was cps director saying children die did you see that clip there too
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:22.960]  okay that's the one that i sent you a couple now i've got these out of texas oklahoma
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:28.480]  arkansas michigan you're five times more likely to die in government custody of your child
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.800]  that's in the foster home or the larger holding facilities that's just department numbers last
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:40.160]  time i saw them the trends going up but i haven't seen a national number in a while i've seen state
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.440]  numbers are off the charts they the kids live in cages the kids live chained up the kids get
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:49.360]  starved to death they get medical experiments done on them again i want to ask the people
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:56.480]  who who who are the enforcers of this i mean what what is it profit a man to gain the whole
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:00.960]  world but lose their soul i know you get bounties on every child's head and i know you're rationalized
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:05.040]  and just say children will die so what so let's play that clip first then we'll just go right into
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:13.920]  the clip of the lady being drug out by police not resisting and then being taser so here it is
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:27.840]  strong words from dhs after the deaths of two children thanks for choosing our witness to use
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:33.840]  five at five i'm naggy carl get anything everyone i'm jessica shambach two-year-old skydon word
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.520]  died sunday tonight her death and the death of another child over the weekend are raising questions
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:45.200]  about how dhs keeps kids safe while they're in foster care and i witness use wise amanda gary
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:50.880]  joins us now and amanda you talked to dhs today and what they told you don't write shocking yeah i
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:57.040]  was shocking because the dhs spokesman like you heard told me children will die no matter if it's
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:04.960]  in their own home or in foster care she was just beautiful of me two-year-old skydon word drowned
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:10.720]  at this foster home in chicochet sunday it's not the only foster care death over the weekend
[1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:18.160]  in ardemore 19-month-old ray palmer died when a car backed over him plus dhs now faces a lawsuit
[1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:24.480]  from a tulsa family they claim this foster parent william hunter jr and appropriately touched his
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:31.760]  foster son so today we went to dhs to ask them what they think about these recent cases so do you
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:39.680]  think something different will have to happen now i don't think so why not because children will die
[1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:45.600]  whether they're in foster care or whether they're in their own relatives care children will die
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:54.000]  accidents will happen period but for melissa word her daughter's drowning was no accident to me i
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:00.240]  think it was neglect and lack of supervision because there's no i'm sorry it or i'm an it's
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:05.920]  an accident if the child would have been watched it would have never happened our bigger question in
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:12.240]  our society right now is why can't parents be better with their kids so they don't have to come
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:18.000]  in the foster care in the first place okay now because of cases like this to say legislator
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:24.480]  it is ordered a six-month-long investigation into dhs and when i asked george excuse me when i asked
[1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:28.400]  george about the investigation if they're going to participate in it he says well they're going to
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:33.280]  but only because the state is or order them and i mean do you tell us that dhs is required to go
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:38.080]  to these foster care homes and check up on them every 30 days did that happen in this case you
[1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:43.920]  know i asked george that and he told me probably so but he couldn't give me an exact answer but
[1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:49.040]  tonight at six i'm going to tell you why these inspections aren't being done every 30 days all
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:18:00.400]  right amanda thank you for your report we'll see you back in october now this fan was sober

[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:48.880]  like control the crowd because like there's a lot of people yelling at the other police because like
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:54.960]  it was a little out of hand what the police officer did to the lady domin said that included
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:19:01.840]  threatening heeding with pepper spray a police officer blocks the camera view but sounds are
[1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:08.480]  clear i was just thinking i was shocked i couldn't believe it was this really scary site domin says
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:14.080]  police officers dragged heeding into the stadium concourse so they laid her down up on the top
[1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:19.040]  level like in the walkway area and she was laying on the ground yeah she was laying on the ground
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:24.080]  face down and she was still kind of squirming so they tasered her and they handcuffed her and

[1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:06.800]  host got someone to blame i'm just an average person one love and i discovered one life 13 years ago
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.840]  a public plan to remove the 1870 law barring the military attacking the american people
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:19.440]  policing the american people the military is trained to kill people and break things
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:28.960]  it's 101 of tyranny to have domestic military forces suppress the people it is 110 percent
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:35.200]  against the founders intentions and against our jurisprudence our common law and our culture
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:42.000]  now going back in the 80s is the earliest that we can document it there's some evidence
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.560]  that went on as early as the 60s regular and of course in the 60s you've got penn state the
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:53.040]  military national guard shooting people shooting students but in the mid 80s covert operations
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:59.360]  with the u.s army and marines aiding police departments covertly with helicopters surveillance
[1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:06.560]  wiretapping gun confiscation and that's covered with the documents and videos and insider interviews
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:13.280]  in my film 9 11 the road to tyranny and the fed training local police departments pre 9 11
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:19.120]  the founding fathers were bad america's bad but the new world order is good training manuals
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:24.320]  saying gun owners are bad it's it's with the phone numbers of the fbi in the manuals i mean
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:30.400]  this is real and we told you they would incrementally stage terror attacks build up a national
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:35.360]  security state put in face scanning cameras thumb scanners to get drivers license federal
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:41.440]  standardization this total grid make it hard to leave the country make it hard to get your money
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:47.760]  out of the country there they're following everything a dictatorship would do but the public
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:54.640]  is distracted by george bush or bill clinton or george bush senior or barack obama thinking oh
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.640]  things are changing for the better or worse for the new president no they're titular
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:07.520]  they are figureheads they are ceremonial they are frontman to push an agenda that's it
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:13.760]  if they get out of line they get killed like kennedy and that military operation in 1963 45
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:20.960]  days 45 years ago in a few days and then we saw the john warner defense authorization act
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:29.600]  two years ago it states in the bill passed by congress that homeland security will take over
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:36.720]  the national guard from the governors but the governors will be under federal control and
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:43.440]  have no authority and that homeland security is being set up with north com to engage the american
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:50.240]  people under insurrection or rebellion or rioting and the military commissions act says they can
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:55.440]  grab a u.s. citizen secretly strip them of citizenship take them overseas torture them
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:28:01.920]  execute them in secret it's in the bill it's all there
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:12.080]  and it goes on and on and on and on and then of course two months ago the army times comes out
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.960]  and says we're deploying this brigade and that list a bunch of other brigades and units that are
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:23.840]  already here to north com to assist in civil emergencies disasters crowd control insurrection
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:31.680]  rioting nonlethal weapons microwave guns sound cannons and they even said in the article
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:40.000]  we hope we don't have to shoot americans total treason on its face seizer bringing his troops
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.680]  into rome this isn't just in us history this is thousands of years old that when this happens
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:55.840]  you're in deep trouble and then what did we see six weeks ago on october third the congress would
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:01.920]  not pass the banker takeover bill now seven point eight trillion stolen in those six weeks none of
[1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:06.640]  the given to the people are for the loans or to get the economy going they're the ones that kill
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:09.840]  the economy so they can consolidate of course they're not want of course they don't want to get it
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:14.240]  jumped started they want to implode it so they can buy it up cheaper they're offshore they're
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:21.600]  foreigners you got that they tell congress we will declare marshal law we will basically abolish
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:27.200]  the congress we will just do it without you we had two congressmen on the show talking about it
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:33.040]  one republican one democrat both senior people couldn't believe it even when it was on c span
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:42.400]  then a week and a half ago it comes out that it was exactly who we said it was in a meeting

[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:40.480]  trying to give me the big picture here that's why i went back over some of the history of this very
[1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:46.880]  brief history only touching on a few facets of it we can talk about how they corrupted the
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:51.600]  military how they corrupted the police how they twisted their culture being one of defenders
[1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:58.560]  honorable warriors into being merchants of wickedness and that transition isn't complete
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:03.120]  we can reverse this i'm not saying you're all bad but the directorship of this is evil
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:09.360]  now we see in england what the type of things we see in pakistan the type of things we see in
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:21.600]  other unstable nations where the secretary of immigration for the conservative party in england
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:29.200]  is arrested under terrorism charges for leaking information to the press that the government
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:34.240]  was legalizing all the illegal aliens i mean that's in mainstream news and they're arresting
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:40.640]  citizens over there for no reason their secret police all over the streets i've been questioned by
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:45.120]  them twice in england steve watson's been taking a date to a rock concert and been questioned
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:48.480]  they won't tell you who they are they demand your papers and threaten you
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:55.440]  this is happening everywhere in the west the elites the social engineers have decided to go
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:35:01.760]  for broke they decided to behave like third world dictators they decided to loot and steal everything
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:06.480]  they decided because they've committed so many crimes they can't go back now do you understand
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:12.240]  that it's like they've already robbed one bank why not rob a hundred they've already kidnapped
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:18.240]  one woman and tortured to death why not kidnap 50 women you see they they have nothing to lose
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:25.840]  folks they have freedom freedom to carry out evil freedom is just another word for nothing left to
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:30.560]  lose you ain't got nothing of you ain't free well that's what they're doing they're free
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:36.480]  to rape rob and steal and they use their propaganda arms in the media to have the public go along with
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:45.760]  it every tenant of a free society every canon of a free society every bedrock common sense thing
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:52.560]  is being overthrown right now as if we couldn't see it coming when they started issuing under
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:59.600]  federal grants black riot uniforms and black mask and armored outfits and sound and microwave guns to
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:08.000]  the police as if we weren't going into tyranny over the last 40 years hundreds of times the cia the
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:14.320]  fbi the military caught shipping and heroin and cocaine as if we weren't in tyranny when police
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:18.720]  all over the western world have been caught staging terror attacks and staging provocateur
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:26.720]  actions to attack free speech i mean it's gone bad folks by design this isn't just some good old
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:33.280]  boy boss hog corruption this is scientifically focused and they have shown every indication
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:38.320]  that they are going to go for broke and that all the corruption and the pain that we see now is
[1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:49.680]  only the beginning that brings me now to tuesday's show where i read the cbs news headline there's
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:55.040]  also an ap headline military examines role in domestic defense and you read this article it's
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:37:00.880]  meant to deceptively introduce it to you like oh there was a government review and it says the
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:06.720]  national guard can't keep us safe from al-qaeda and so we've got to go ahead and just abolish
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:12.000]  the bill of rights we've got to just go ahead and have regular military on the streets oh this is
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:17.760]  just now starting oh the military is just now announcing that this is going to be done when
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:23.440]  they passed all those laws and regulations and before they even had passed laws they had
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:30.160]  covertly been doing this but now they all this just now is happening defense secretary robert gates
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:34.400]  ordered his top department leaders to conduct a broad review to determine whether the military
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:37.920]  national guard and reserve can adequately deal with domestic disasters and whether they have
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:43.600]  the training and equipment to defend the homeland the 41 page memo signaled an acknowledgement
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:48.080]  that the military must better reorganize the critical role of the national guard and reserves
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:52.400]  and homeland defense but stop short of requiring many specific policy changes that's not true i've
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:57.200]  read the entire policy and gates over and over again says this has already been done
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:03.840]  in fact here's a quote from the ap he said another 29 recommendations are underway
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.040]  are finished and and what are those recommendations see they start the article out by saying oh it's
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:14.080]  just a government report they're looking at doing this and then you read the article it goes oh by
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:23.520]  the way gates said 29 recommendations are underway or finished now uh there's 80 plus of these in
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:32.000]  the 400 page independent report and i read over these yes i read 400 plus pages i did that uh
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:39.120]  wednesday night and then last night i read twice his 50-something page directorate directive and by
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:46.080]  the way it's all implemented it's all done it's all done it's just most of it is illegal because
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:51.840]  congress hasn't passed laws to authorize it yet kind of like bush got up two years ago and said
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:56.720]  we're not spying on americans without warrants that's ridiculous that that's a lie and then
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:00.880]  it came out they were spying on everybody and they said okay we got a retroactively pass a law to do
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:04.800]  it then they lied to the media and said oh it's just so we can listen to al qaeda then it turned
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:10.880]  out abc news reports they listened to americans phone sex and they listened to the congressman's
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:15.840]  phone sex and they listened to the troops calling home to their wives and they stood around laughing
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.040]  at the nsa and the national reconnaissance office and the hundreds of other private groups
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.640]  two-thirds of these spying is being done by private groups now in office buildings they just listened
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:31.600]  to everything and they use it and they sell the data to corporations they use it to offshore
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:35.440]  they use it to break down the country they use it to be able to take over other businesses
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:40.480]  and corporations that's the main reason they use this nsa data they just tell you it's to fight al
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:50.320]  ciata now i want to challenge you to go to the air force times and then they have a link
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:40:01.120]  to the defense department memo you can read it there i have it here in my hands and read it go
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.880]  read it for yourself and find out because this is what's already been done they're just now
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:15.840]  announcing it kind of like bill clinton signed an executive order of 93 stating that if the
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:22.000]  highway departments of the 50 states and territories and and possessions wanted their highway funds
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:27.360]  they take our money from the state and then they send it back about 33 on average and they say okay
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:32.000]  here's the strings attached you got to put these face scanning cameras in you've got to
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.600]  have your police dress this way you've got me just hundreds of things they have to do
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:40.720]  they said you've got to put thumb scanners in and a digital photo for face scanning in
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:44.240]  if you want your highway funds and by the late 90s every state had adopted it
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:49.760]  and then they tell us in 2008 we're going to have a national ID card standardized when we
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:56.080]  already had it and under treaty in 2000 it was already standardized worldwide in every industrial
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:03.360]  nation your driver's license or id is a world id card and they're just now getting around to
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:10.000]  telling you it's a national id card just like this has already been set up illegally and he says
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:19.360]  well we've gotten 29 of our 80 something recommendations but we've got to have congress
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:26.480]  get rid of our old prejudices like posse commentators he actually says that oh the prejudices
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:32.720]  against the military like it's a prejudice oh the poor military can't can't raid our homes we
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:38.240]  don't like them why don't you like them you're not pro america no our founding fathers said don't
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:43.360]  do it the governors the common sense the history because the military becomes the enemy of the
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:49.520]  people but he spends it in the directorate in the directive that it's mean to them
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:56.720]  i mean this is sick psychology folks totally sick when you talk to the majority of troops and
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:02.000]  they've done internal polls and studies upwards of 80 say they don't want to police the american people
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:09.040]  but again he spends it because the whole military all the officers are being directed to read this
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:14.720]  and it's like they want to be mean to us they don't want the troops here in rome the senate
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:20.880]  doesn't want us to occupy rome what are we going to do boys we're going to take them over seizer
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:26.480]  that's right and you notice under barack obama it's all accelerating and in here they talk about
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:33.120]  the national guard you're going to have to serve months every year everybody's going to have to
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:38.640]  be a part of it it's the exactly what obama's saying but obama's saying exactly what george bush
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:44.000]  said and exactly what clinton said and exactly what george bush senior said it's the same program
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:47.200]  they just passed the baton to obama to be the puppet
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:58.000]  this is from ap the report released early this year by the commission on the national guard and
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:02.720]  reserves of the pentagon must be used the nation's citizen soldiers now again the report that two
[1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:07.360]  years ago they passed a law to do this to create an operational force that would be fully trained
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:12.480]  equipped and ready to defend the nation response to crises and supplement the active duty troops
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:17.360]  in combat then and then they mentioned the ordinance disposal teams and say it's going to be law
[1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:21.040]  enforcement it's going to be everything but remember that's how it all started in my film the
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:26.160]  road to tyranny where we'd have these ordinance disposal teams at checkpoints on i-35 in quote
[1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:30.800]  training missions pulling over real citizens who didn't know what it was and the troops would come
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:38.320]  over to us and say turn your cameras off and we'd say no so that's how they started it and they had
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:43.920]  a secret program in 77 texas counties and the documents we got then saying don't let anybody
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:50.160]  know because it's illegal but we're here to aid you and warrant service rating homes you name it
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:55.040]  that's all in police state to the takeover released in 2000
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:02.320]  see how long this has been going on all around you but then it announces regular army brigades
[1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:07.920]  of national guard and notice recruitment's way up because when they bankrupt the economy people
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:12.400]  basically have to join the military and now it says you will serve domestically and you can sign
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:21.600]  up to just serve domestically exactly what obama said this is government domestic police he said
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:28.080]  a one million man as big as the military domestic intelligence force that's only one cadre in this
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:39.440]  they've now announced they've now announced the new green deal with as we told you three million
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:46.480]  green environmental officers i mean folks and they're going to tax and regulate and seize and
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:53.360]  harass they'll all have machine guns it's it's a horrible folks it's so horrible to see this happen
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:45:00.960]  to america and we told you how long ago that this is with it's all coming to a head and now
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:06.000]  they're arresting high-level government ministers under terrorism same stuff's going on in england
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:14.800]  he gave them 25 days to submit the proposed changes along with budget impact they might have
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.360]  in connection with 53 separate recommendations he said another 29 recommendations are underway or
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:25.360]  finished the commission's reported 95 excuse me recommendations but gave did not order many
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:30.000]  of these changes using the commission to give the national guard and reserve troops better access
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:39.440]  it goes on okay now and so the military will like this there's pay increases and things in there
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:48.000]  just like out of rome i'll give you more gold each man gets five golden sistercies for joining us
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:58.000]  history repeats itself will anybody notice listen to this this is from the air force times
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:04.320]  the memo sent to every senior uniformed and civilian pentagon leader and copied to three
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:08.880]  other cabinet secretaries gates directed the development of a new total force integration
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:13.520]  policy that recognizes the cultural divide that exists between the active and reserve components
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:22.320]  all vestiges of cultural prejudice that remain in law in law should be removed by congress he wrote
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:26.640]  now they already did that to a great extent under john warner defense authorization act
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:34.880]  if the president declares martial law but this just integrates us and puts us into martial law
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:40.800]  where north com is over the governor's and even says that in here gates also called upon congress
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:46.000]  to mandate the national garden reserves the lead role and in the form the backbone of do the
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:50.240]  operations of the homeland then you go read what these guys are saying in mainstream news it says
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:58.560]  domestic law enforcement 20 of the 82 recommendations will require this is 82 that's is 95 the support
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:02.720]  of congress one asked the president direct all federal agencies to issue guidance emphasizing

[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:43.920]  that it's on the table to devalue the dollar uh coming up in january or february probably in
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:49.920]  february that's the big unpopular surprise while you still can move federal reserve notes
[2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:56.240]  at least 10 20 30 percent i mean even mainline analysts on fox business and in cnbc business
[2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:03.360]  are saying that people should get into golden silver and and and i challenge you go ahead
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:07.760]  find out what gold and silver's selling for right now ladies and gentlemen ted bought this at a
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:13.120]  little over 700 dollar 701 to 710 when he bought this group of coins you know when gold was at
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:22.000]  that price and so uh you know then he he he has some of it left a lot of it's gone uh and this

[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:33.840]  strike a chord in the present with what the global banking structure is doing your point of view
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:37.360]  your perspective on what's happening there and then let's get into what makes them the
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:42.160]  new order tech and what their what their endgame is michael right thanks i mean
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:48.080]  my research has started pretty much in ireland uh... and about thirteen years of age i started to
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:53.280]  realize uh... you know two things one is that we're being told nothing but a tissue of lies from
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:58.880]  the official orthodox fundamentalistic sort of educational system it just doesn't fit the facts
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:03.600]  uh... growing up in belfast at that time was very difficult because there's a lot of violence and
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:08.560]  trouble but basically i started to see through that and check out the you know the orange parades
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:13.520]  that happened in the uh... on july and seeing a lot of the symbolism that was being used there
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:17.920]  where one thing led to another through the study of this symbolism that's being used by the orange
[2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:22.960]  order i suddenly started to research the history of the orange order discovered that it's not so
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:28.480]  much a political you know organization as it is a fraternal brotherhood and then i saw subsequently
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.680]  later you know a few years later start discovering that this is the same story with the ira and particularly
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:38.880]  the provisional ira and then we have the official ira and then i start to notice by tracking through
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:42.320]  all the all the different symbolism and then going through the you know the research works and the
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:47.200]  reference works that basically what we're dealing here is a one-party system you know i mean this
[2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:51.680]  is in the early days so i didn't have the whole globalist picture here but just from my own
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:56.480]  research is in the in the uh... micro you know microcosm of ireland growing up there i realized
[2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:02.080]  that you know we're not being told the truth about these organizations and how these are connected
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:07.600]  to the super masonic or orders the pre-masonic orders so basically around fifteen sixteen years
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:14.720]  of age again pretty much in an Irish context i've broadened my study to look into this whole movement
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:19.280]  of the secret societies in the world and this was you know a little bit before coming across the
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:24.160]  works of the great American scholars like the g edward griffins and the Eustace Mullins is and the
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:31.360]  Jordan Maxwell's and so forth and so on you know i mean i hadn't had exposure to these thinkers
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:37.360]  even the Ralph Apperson's you know all the people who basically connect all the all the dots had to
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:44.560]  wait till i came to america you know in a in sort of 82 and then later on in the 90s to really sort
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:50.400]  of have these teachers help put things together but i noticed that you see in america a few people
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:56.240]  have the whole european understanding of how the british royals how some of the uh fabian
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:01.520]  networks how the common purpose how some of the uh you know groups like the club of the aisles
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:06.400]  and this connects again with high level freemasonry not only scottish right freemasonry
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:11.520]  but like i say the orange order the orders that are behind the ira like the irish republican
[2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:16.800]  brotherhood the ancient order of hiberians the green ribbon society the clown negale
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:22.720]  all from an irish context my studies and continued to show me that these groups that are funded and
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:28.160]  armed to the teeth basically what the public knows terrorist organizations operating in ireland
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:32.960]  are far from merely irish these groups are connected to the internationally the underground
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:39.760]  of the entire black hand meaning the entire terrorist network and that's used to be stabilized
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:44.480]  and frightened the public into accepting the state dominating them and it's even come out
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:50.000]  in mainstream news now that the ira and the orange the protestants at the highest levels
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:54.640]  were really meeting and working together and that they were all basically british and international
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:59.840]  intelligence just completely staged on a very high level see again when you point your finger
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:03.520]  in this direction people you know they sort of poo poo that they can't see that because they've
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:08.560]  been so brainwashed they've been so you know brainwashed by the media that they don't check
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:13.840]  these things out i'm one of only three three of us that have you know studied the uh
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:18.720]  local history of ireland this is where my research is then you know lo and behold i just know it's
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:23.440]  come out all over the mainstream news and i've had a lot of the former british commandos sas on
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:28.320]  who they would finally get to the top of the ira and all three of the leaders were all british
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:33.920]  intelligence and then they would you know infiltrate the orange and find out you know that the three
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:38.640]  heads of the ira were meeting with the three heads of the orange and it was just a way to
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:44.480]  terrorize the public and they use the infighting and the bombings as a pretext to basically murder
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:50.160]  and kill and oppress whoever they want they've done that they've been by consistently you know
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:55.440]  this incredible fear and death toll and the murder of innocent people in the country on both sides
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:14:58.720]  i'm talking because i'm not partisan i'm not fighting with either side i'm just looking at this
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:03.920]  thing you know from the overview yeah that trouble made ireland a third world country in the west
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:08.400]  they degraded the people they kept them ignorant they kept them stupid while they used the land
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:13.360]  and that's the only divide and conquer and now groups today want you to bash the protestants
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:17.920]  or want you to bash the jews or want you to bash the catholics or want you to bash the hindus
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:22.480]  or they always want you to bash a particular group and they always want to divide our movement
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.640]  into all these subgroups and then they'll claim that i'm this group or that group just so they
[2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:31.600]  can get other groups like hunting dogs to alert on me and i'm trying to explain to them they're in
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:38.240]  a controlled sub paradigm how many jugglers can you get in a room how many pit bulls can
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:43.920]  you get into the pan you know this is i saw firsthand in the the irish context also that
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:47.520]  these groups were connected to these higher masonic orders because we're not talking about the
[2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:50.960]  street level stuff here that you know people are never going to get their mind around at all
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:54.800]  but anyone who studied the british system and how these clubs and these organizations
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:59.360]  return all orders are networked into these terrorist organizations how they fund them
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:04.080]  how they meet at the top like you say behind the so-called large door that not a single one
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:08.880]  of these distinctions not one a single one of these biases that people are willing to die for
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:12.320]  in the streets you see this is what i saw in ireland whether you're jew or muslim you're
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:18.320]  christian or or not or whether you are protestant or catholic or whether you are rich or poor or
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:23.200]  whether you are conservative or labor you see all these divisions of people are just in meshed in
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:28.400]  in the outer world i started to learn that this doesn't mean a damn behind the large door that's
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:32.560]  a totally different agenda and that's how my research is you know research is into deeper
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:36.800]  matters into the whole occult symbolism that these people are using and their occult origins
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:42.960]  and and and really it's a gang uh... of course more most masons are well-meaning good people
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:48.640]  that understand that the higher levels of their order uh... you know have been used as a vehicle
[2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:54.560]  for secret intelligence agency operations is you know basically what's happening in the new world
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:17:01.360]  order goes to like a wardrobe with a catholic outfit a jewish outfit a muslim outfit a protestant
[2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:07.360]  outfit and they just put that cloak on and and and that's why it's so hard to get after them
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:11.680]  but we know the overriding thing they want you know they say they're trying to get rid of government
[2:17:11.680 --> 2:17:17.360]  but really they create the mega state through which they can control the society and i'm very
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:21.600]  concerned about what you just said about the fact that we have to start appealing i mean my main
[2:17:21.600 --> 2:17:26.560]  message is for the complete disband disbanding of all secret societies you know i don't belong
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:31.040]  to any secret society never have done and the message that is often you know recurrent through
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:35.440]  my own work is for the total illegality the making of all these kinds of secret societies
[2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:39.520]  i don't care if it's opus die or scottish right free masonry with the the masses of the world
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:44.240]  have need need to actually start integrating laws that make these groups absolutely illegal
[2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:49.600]  but more than that is i in the meantime until we do that my message actually goes out to members
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:53.280]  like some of these the good the good folks the good people who are you know the rank and follow
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:58.560]  these orders that's why my research has taken me into the subject of masonry and into the
[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:02.320]  cultism and i've had a lot of backlash from that from people who don't have a you know a clue in
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:06.080]  their head as to why you want to maybe study this kind of subject matter well how the hell are you
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:10.960]  going to appeal to people who are you know well-meaning members of these various secret
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:15.040]  societies unless you speak in their own language in order to try and explain to them some of the
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:18.640]  symbolism and the rights and the rituals where it comes from not that some of the rights and
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:22.800]  rituals are wrong it's just that you're doing a normal critique in order to relate to these people
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:27.200]  you've got to know what they're doing that you know you get you got to know what well michael i
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:32.160]  don't want to i don't want to disagree with you but any anything that has the power to ban
[2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:37.920]  something uh... you know there's a right of association uh... itself could turn into a
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:42.640]  great tyranny and i think there should be public exposure uh... there should be open discussions
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:48.240]  if groups are found to be involved in collusion you know the classic case of you know somebody
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:52.400]  who's committed a murder you know the mason and distress sign and they're let off that that happened
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:57.040]  with a great uncle i had him he told us about it it wasn't it was the cases in the newspaper
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.320]  but you know his argument was he had to go through a masonic trial afterwards
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:04.160]  uh... but you know to find out if that was you know true or that they would have a quote that
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:09.360]  dealt with him and rounding him uh... if he would have lied you tell low level mason's that
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:13.840]  they just don't uh... you know they're just not aware of the higher level things that go on but
[2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:20.720]  but asking you a question uh... i mean how do you say ban these things you know the the the
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.600]  engine that could ban these societies uh... would would would rise up into a mighty tyranny itself
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:29.760]  yeah there's always a danger and there's always a danger that uh...
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:33.920]  you know by by making them illegal they go underground it's not at all wins the solution
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:37.760]  but what needs to happen is that ordinary people have got to find out about the tiger in the long
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:42.320]  grass and at least armed themselves up with even a modicum i mean that's what our programs are
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:46.160]  doing that's what our work is doing and you do have to address it i like to address them because
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:50.640]  it's better to address them you know you can address the beginners you can address the season
[2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:54.320]  and you have to address the insider as well so my work goes all out to the insiders i mean you
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:19:59.280]  said it yourself a few minutes ago you had insiders from the orange lodge insiders from the IRA
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:03.760]  whistleblowers in if you look back through the whole conspiracy movement and the exposure you'll
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:08.480]  find that the greatest damage is being done by the generals by the insiders by the politicians you
[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:13.360]  know even up to the level of presidents who come out written memoirs and and expose the tiger in
[2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:17.200]  the long grass so we never you know it's not my main focus but it's something that we surely need
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:22.320]  to always you know take on board okay michael listen i'm gonna skip this break for info wars dot

[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:50.880]  we're going to go over the basic view from michael the sarian and of british secret society
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:57.280]  networks using pre-mationary as one vehicle because of its secrecy they can inhabit any group
[2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:02.480]  and then the secret symbolism the language it's all around us that they communicate through
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.920]  and again the low level masons aren't even part of it and there are other religious groups and
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:12.960]  secret groups you know masons oversimplifies it then we'll get into what the end game is and the
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:20.960]  uh... technocratic oppression the electronic control grid we've got an hour and 35 minutes
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:26.240]  left with our guests okay michael you got the floor start rolling well that was you know
[2:25:26.240 --> 2:25:30.640]  when i got over to states then i had to basically brush up and that's when i bumped into the work
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:35.920]  of nord davis and especially ralph epperson you know he was just great he his work put a lot of
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:40.080]  pieces together for me and then of course the great d edward griffin and eustace mollins you
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:44.720]  know it became like a study because when i realized that the average american doesn't know anything
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:49.680]  about this yeah i'd bump into the average you know i bump into occasionally to a vietnam vet
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:55.040]  who had been through so much hell through the va hospitals that these guys knew you know something
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:59.120]  about what was going on especially about the federal system and the federal reserve and so on
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:03.840]  and so my education began in the 90s you know to sort of brush up on okay i've seen it in an
[2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:09.600]  Irish context i've seen that one picture of tyranny but how does this work in the american context
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:14.720]  you know so as i start to study more and get into the webster topple easy see and even the
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:20.960]  dr john colman's it was a long discovery to find out that this country has didn't really win the
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:26.320]  war of independence because they let their guard down they became so apathetic they became so decadent
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:31.840]  and narcissistic that you know it was easy pickings right from the time of you know the first presidents
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:36.720]  basically for this federalistic group to get into to insinuate itself into the body politic of
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:42.880]  america through the federal systems to to get rid of the republic to change the constitution to amend
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:47.280]  it and so forth and so on all the stuff that you've covered yourself and so many things you know this
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:53.360]  was my education to find out but my main point was though is it more of a historian aspect to say
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:59.920]  look never forget that america is just the last in line to be taken down the people who are doing
[2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:05.360]  this have colonized and colonized the world they've been doing it for centuries of time and my
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:11.200]  research is leaded back to egypt you know the first of all i had studied the ancient irish myths
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:16.000]  that helped me you know with my first book on atlantis to get into a lot of areas there to show
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:21.360]  just how ancient this actual you know oligarchy is that they keep bloodlines and these bloodlines
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:25.760]  are still today and the politicians that pop their heads up every every you know every four years
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:30.960]  there they are again with their bloodline connections back to the ancient royal oligarchs of europe
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:35.760]  but then what happened is i got more and more you know into it after the first book was done
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:41.120]  then i started to really look at the egyptian roots of this and my research took me to a group
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:47.280]  that i referred to as the atlants it's the same group of you know people would refer to say by
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:53.200]  the terms such as luciferian or whatever you know my term for is atlants this is going back to the
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:28:02.080]  14th dynasty the 18th dynasty of europe 18th dynasty of egypt about 1400 years bc is where
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.200]  it all began you know so i've actually traced it back to the reign of the pharaoh akhenaten
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:12.880]  and just to be clear when you read mainline even british history you know they say they're
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:19.120]  related to pharaohs they say they are related to moses and you know and and and and the you
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:24.480]  the queen is coordinated on jacob stone and all of this and and and so they really believe
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:30.720]  this in worldwide international royalty even in japan says that the the greatest queen is the
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:35.920]  the royalty in england and that they all claim they're part of that and are part of the same
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:41.200]  secret societies there so regardless of whether it's true or not they do claim lineage to the
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:47.200]  pharaohs you're absolutely spot on and you see it doesn't have to be necessarily just bloodline for
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:52.400]  a certain amount of the top boys it is a bloodline connection for everybody else that serves this
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:59.040]  monster it's an ideological you know a connection equally equally as bad equally as pernicious these
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.120]  are not people who serve the good of the human race or for the uplift of the human race these
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:07.360]  are ancient pharaohs who's kept who've kept bloodline dynasties and people better believe
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:12.560]  that they have not gone away the different houses of europe that i address you see on the symbolism
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:17.200]  that they use so as i started to track this back it started to explain these things about like you
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:22.160]  say the symbolism behind the coronation and all the various other symbolism and regalia
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:27.360]  that we see throughout all of europe as well as britain and it was fascinating to see that you know
[2:29:27.360 --> 2:29:32.560]  how it all went back to this particular individual and his sort of megalomania this akhenaten
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:37.600]  and his basically solar cult these were worshipers of the sun uh they were worshipers of what i
[2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:43.520]  refer to as the dark side of the sun and you know their generation they were expersed finally from
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:49.440]  egypt they had they had basically committed so much desecration on the land of egypt but finally
[2:29:49.440 --> 2:29:54.560]  you know in the reign of akhenaten the people of egypt rose up and and basically exiled these guys
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:29:58.560]  and then history loses track of them they just disappear whether you're coming at this from a
[2:29:58.560 --> 2:30:01.840]  biblical point of view as you said through the moses story or you're coming at it through
[2:30:01.840 --> 2:30:06.240]  alternative historical approaches basically they're meant to have fallen off the map and history
[2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:10.880]  pays them no more mind my work picks up on the fact that after they were exiled after this
[2:30:10.880 --> 2:30:16.080]  famous exodus they did not fade away and that these people are instrumental behind the you know
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:19.920]  powers and grief no it's stay there stay there we'll be back in three minutes michael was

[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:16.400]  that looks really powerful tisarian is t-s-a-r-i-o-n so michael tisarian.com uh michael now again I
[2:34:16.400 --> 2:34:21.680]  don't know if the queen of England is really related to uh moses I don't know if she's really
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:30.160]  related to uh the the egyptian pharaohs bc I don't know uh if the sung king of france you
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:36.640]  know was was really related to Jesus's family the point is they believe they are they take
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:40.960]  it deadly serious and I've been inside bohemian grove people say oh that's just a play you know
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:47.200]  a mock human sacrifice well regardless of what it is those old men that I was within that crowd
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:51.600]  of about 1500 watching the ritual they were in religious rapture they were grinding their teeth
[2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:58.480]  they were breathing heavy uh whatever the real ritual was was over behind some black curtains
[2:34:58.480 --> 2:35:03.680]  from the trees across the water before they brought the baby you know the small child uh the the
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:09.440]  effigy over to burn it uh before uh lilith but then of course these call occult issues different
[2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:15.360]  names they called it molek I know that's the bull but they call their their owl molek uh and uh
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:20.400]  they address it as a female and then as a male deity and then they had I mean you know it's all
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:25.360]  on video in my uh film uh the order of death and then we had somebody else sneak in and they then
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:30.480]  set up and sent to prison uh christ jones no relation to me so so I mean this is really going on
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:35.440]  they really believe this whether it's true or not I know you from your deep research in europe
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:42.000]  around the world believe there is some basis in fact in it so let's continue on michael well
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:46.160]  that's right uh you know again as it as far as I'm concerned as well they believe it in their
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:51.840]  own heads they're not only bloodline connection they have the ideological henchmen who have sworn
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:57.600]  allegiance you know for one reason or another the basic fact is that my researchers did discover this
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:04.160]  uh the connection to Egypt not only there but this uh that the basic uh origin of the night's
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:09.840]  templar the order of sign on you know just the very Judaic phrases which actually are more
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:14.400]  correctly to say egyptian apnus phrases well that's a little stop you're right there I mean
[2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:20.080]  that's an absolute fact and and that's not even hidden that in the you know basic masonic literature
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:26.880]  and basic magic literature white and black uh it's all about the keys of Solomon Solomon's ring
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:33.360]  the seal of Solomon uh it's all about controlling these jinn these entities these angels and Solomon
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:38.880]  was open about it was the secret of Egypt and the secrets of Greece and the secrets of Babylon
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:44.400]  and the secrets of uh all of these countries and people then say well the whole new world order
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:51.120]  is Judaic no it was the jews that codified it and who were big on writing things down and so in
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:56.080]  Alexandria got destroyed in Egypt and when Rome got destroyed in its libraries it was the Judaics
[2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:02.720]  who carried on the ministry schools right within that not ordinary jews but this elite group uh
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:08.480]  the level level we're talking about the cab yeah we're talking about the cabalistic levitical mosaic
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:12.160]  and also that what's called the guy on them this is a word that people have got to become familiar
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:17.520]  with because it explains the capital g that the masons use you know um people want to pick up my
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:22.240]  Irish origins of civilization double volume they're going to find chapter after chapter they're
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:27.920]  showing this connection between the Judaic elites and the ancient pharaonics and then how that
[2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:33.120]  percolates down into modern times through this occult you know bloodline dragon court thread
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:37.440]  that people really need to be understanding about so they can not only decode the symbolism
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:41.600]  but they can find out the roots of this tyranny because we're here in the effects of the tyranny
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:47.360]  but we need to know its origins as well and the most amazing thing is that these guys mean business
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:52.720]  they lost an empire in the past and and you know they subsequently experienced a old world
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:57.120]  disorder and so everything that's being built now you know students of the new world order
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:01.120]  need to realize it's because they're trying to build a new world order to replace an old
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:05.600]  and that's why their symbol is that's why their symbol is the pyramid and the all-seeing eye
[2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:10.960]  which is the black sunshine exactly these people do worship the dark side of the sun they can
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:16.000]  rightly be referred christians refer to them as lucifer and and so perfectly adequate is and
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:21.920]  that's what the nazi's secret highest was the black sun so it is yeah and people say oh yeah
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:26.080]  him how could the zionist and the nazis work at the same thing because it doesn't matter all
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:32.400]  these people at the top worship the same deal how can it be that the same order of the knights of
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:38.960]  malta the sovereign order of the knights of malta can have members as extreme right as von pappen
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:43.600]  and as herman goering and then five minutes later be initiating into their order people
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:48.320]  is on the left as nelson mandela i got a question for people as to why that would be they got to
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:52.080]  realize that behind the large doors we said earlier none of these uh distinctions on the
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:56.560]  street level mean a damn this is an entire you know carnival of donce macabre for people to get
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:01.360]  caught up in you know it's it's just has no reality and this is what people need to understand if
[2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:05.440]  they study the symbolism long enough if they track it through and i've done like 30 years of research
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:10.000]  on this so you know that this is the age in which this information is now finally coming to light
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:15.280]  this these guys you not only do they fully believe it in their own minds some of these kings and queens
[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:21.200]  like louis 16th of france and various other potentates have designed entire cities based on
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:25.280]  egyptian symbolism to prove that they believe themselves as a new yeah that was the king's
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:29.120]  and son ferro's yeah that was the sun king and called himself the sun king and then we had
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:34.560]  france wal meteron admitting that he was channeling lucifer and going on mountaintops to pray
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:43.600]  then they had the japanese architect build a pyramid uh with 666 pieces of this uh gold pink
[2:39:43.600 --> 2:39:50.480]  glass and it has black pyramid inside i mean this is all right out in the open that's right i
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:55.120]  never stop stressing you see i mean even though i've written a lot on island you know the second
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:40:00.240]  book in the volume is dedicated to egypt to show exactly that it came from a specific time from a
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:08.240]  specific individual a specific cult a specific warped version of solar cultism you see and how
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:12.960]  this continues alive that is why there are so many obelisks in in roland and vatican city
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:17.680]  that's why roam has certain you know geometric alignments that it does same thing applies to
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:23.760]  washington dc same thing applies to cologne the paris they believe that they call in spiritual
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:28.000]  forces from another dimension uh now again whether you believe this or not folks the elite believe
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:34.400]  it explain the uh the the sacred architecture well that's right and within masonry if you look
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.480]  at the highest degree of masonry they have that judic aspect that you were talking about knights
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:44.240]  of the kadosch knights of the you know the secret you know all of these weird terminologies they've
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:48.640]  got right there people can see this in the design of the cities they can you know i have a huge
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:52.960]  collection of masonic literature so we're not making anything up this is from the horse's mouth
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:58.160]  you only need to go to the albert mackeys and to the actual masonic encyclopedias this is not hard
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.000]  to do even though it takes a lot of time but if people spend the time you know see the peruse
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:06.480]  our works and we put this stuff on dvd we put it in books so it's there for people who don't have
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:11.680]  the time to do all this research to find out that america is not free america has been colonized by
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:16.320]  the you know the royals and the pharaohs of old and they america was ostensibly meant to be the
[2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:21.520]  last bastion against these oligarchs these imperialists what the people need to understand
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:27.440]  in america context but particularly is that the imperialism is not gone away the stuff that you're
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:31.520]  seeing now with the you know the amaro coming in and the nafta and the kafta and the destruction
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:36.720]  of the american constitution this is a form of imperialism that has been in iran iran says no
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:40.960]  to the lisbon treaty eu expansion and then they say we don't care we're going to bring it back up
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:47.120]  for another vote or implement it by fiat exactly the same way that you know this is a mafia also
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:52.400]  situation they'll never this this kind of a vampire never goes away until it's invited across
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:58.320]  and going back to egypt we you know we see in the old testament uh and in the new over and over
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:03.760]  again the pharaoh would send out to the different slave groups he had and would kill a large portion
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:10.480]  of their children to keep the slaves at a lower population uh you see the cps today uh going out
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:15.920]  and kidnapping the children it's all repeated and they figured out thousands of years ago thousands
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:21.600]  of years bc how to control societies and i want i want to highlight something you just said a few
[2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:26.560]  minutes ago about the kind of dark forces that they're in league with those dark you know again
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:31.200]  if people don't understand it that's that's too bad but the fact is these people do not act
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:36.400]  in just a material sphere of you know of influence they are very much tied into something off world
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:42.640]  they're tied into other dark angelic forces and they have to offer up sacrifices on this planet
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:47.760]  to those beings that they're in league with and that is what my and my view is you know pretty
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:52.560]  much a lot of the child abduction the wars the world wars that we've experienced and just the
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:43:00.160]  general appetite or not the appetite but the general every day the uh toxic you know uh influx
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:05.520]  of trauma across the tv you see and in our world in general they need anxiety they want to keep people
[2:43:05.520 --> 2:43:10.960]  you know crippled and they are changing our neural pathways showing us millions of simulated
[2:43:10.960 --> 2:43:16.240]  murders on tv traumatizing us where they now have university studies with the brainwaves
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.240]  where the area of the brain associated with pleasure even and we'll quote mainstream people
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:25.920]  is lighting up when they see simulated murders towards your death they are turning us psychically
[2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:31.680]  into them i couldn't agree more alex and you know it's a situation of the normal lower level
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:38.080]  sadomasochism that people have multiplied infinitely this constant appeal to the limbic and mammalian
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:43.040]  centers of the brain you know and it's a diet and a diet until you get so used to it that you
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:47.680]  don't even know what reason is anymore you can't critically look at anything you have an immediate
[2:43:47.680 --> 2:43:51.280]  defense mechanism as soon as they you know it's like most of these people that today you have the
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:56.560]  internet riddle with internet assassins and debunkers so-called quote unquote and these are
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:00.960]  people that i described like the deer in the headlights of the oncoming truth movement who
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:06.240]  cannot stand that oncoming you know juggernaut of truth and that's the next issue is the enemy
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:12.080]  knows throughout history the human spirit rebels goodness you know the light you know literally
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:16.320]  blots out their their black sunshine as they call it and so they're doing everything they can with
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:21.680]  chemicals and microwaves and frequency pollution and radiation openly and they write all this
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:25.200]  in their own documents that we've covered we cover an in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:30.400]  to pollute our minds with the images the toxins all of it overlaid you know the brainwashing
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:36.320]  of the television both semantically and with the frequency of it to to to try to blind us
[2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:41.680]  and i've seen them go from arrogant to now being fearful what are they so afraid of michael
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:46.880]  well they're always afraid of the human race because this is the surf you know that they've
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:51.760]  they've been able to enslave and of course the the big fear is that you know that particular
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:57.520]  indentured servant slave might in fact wake up and throw away you know all of the junk that you
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:02.880]  know you basically an age of awakening is what they're fearful of anyone who has control that's
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:07.600]  surreptitious anyone who has a catalog of of criminality like they have these are super criminals
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:13.040]  mega criminals the genocides the colonializations the war on consciousness you know all the devastation
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:17.920]  that they've wreaked of course these are criminals who don't want you know to be discovered or the
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:22.320]  light to be shown on them i've often said in my work that hey these guys say that they're worshipers
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:26.480]  of the sun they claim to worship light what would happen to them let's see the effects on them when
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.800]  we turn the light of truth and knowledge onto them see how they like it you know and this is the
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:38.320]  revelation says they traffic in the souls of men that's really what's valuable to them is blinders
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:42.240]  shutting people down darkness destruction look at the artwork the elite buys
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:47.680]  buckets of maggots images of dead babies i mean i mean this is the most popular art across the
[2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:52.880]  board worldwide with the elites you know a hundred million pounds sometimes at 200 million dollars
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:58.080]  you know for one piece of blasphemous art and they say we're buying this art to worship it
[2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:03.600]  to to adulate it uh to you know to give it the support it deserves so what is their master plan
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:08.400]  if they were to win what is the world they're trying to set up well let's get into the technological
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:12.880]  well they're not trying they're not trying to set it up they've already been doing it as i said
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:17.600]  before this imperialist movement of this juggernaut we're only seeing the latter days of something
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:24.480]  that has been a continuous ongoing incremental movement you know gone through history americans
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:28.400]  tend to you know not see that they don't see uh you know the whole movement of the whole
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:34.160]  michael i see it i'm talking about their in game they're gearing up for something big well i believe
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:39.680]  it's basically this ties into my work on 2012 and what's coming there it's a sort of a zero hour
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:44.880]  this is the death of anything human it doesn't mean the death of the planet it doesn't mean you know
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:51.040]  the end of nature it doesn't even necessarily mean the end of the world what it means is that
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:55.440]  the end and by god anyone with their eyes open can see it's already taken place it's a countdown
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:01.760]  to the extinction of what we would use when we say the word human what we will have after 2012
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:07.200]  2015 you see is a post human world they're racing headlong you've dealt with it and then again
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:14.720]  all their future is all their futures they are saying that they will have it by 2012 to 2020
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:19.920]  if it occurs well that you're right they are incrementally now but accelerating it turning
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:28.000]  all the systems on well remember what they're going to turn on happens 2012 and post before you
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:33.200]  can turn something on you've got to end or bring to an end not which was before so all the idioms
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:37.600]  all the customs the traditions that all the people of the world especially of the western world
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:40.800]  because the western world is now as you see being turned into a third world country in the third
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:45.280]  world's rising to be a first world what we're heading towards right now is basically a post
[2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:51.440]  human dystopia in which man is either so reduced to a robotic level that he runs even more headlong
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:56.880]  into the pharmaceutical thing to drug and to escape himself or it will literally be some sort of
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:02.880]  blade runner dystopia in which you are literally you know going to be vaccinated in a way that
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:08.240]  would change is your you know being or your mess with our DNA and by the way 20 years ago they
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:14.480]  had live viruses and now they're advertising them that go in and create lobotomies in key areas of
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:21.360]  the brain the viruses attack specific brain tissues to literally create mindless gibbering
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:27.920]  automatons and and all of them say this is the plan and DARPA says this is the plan and as horrible
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:33.600]  as this sounds they need to do this and they want to exterminate at least 90 percent of us and have
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:40.080]  10 percent suboid subhuman slave creatures that serve them well i believe if you if you also bring
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:45.360]  in the whole uh you know the concept of the GMOs you start to discover that the hoarding of the
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:50.400]  actual organic seeds that nature has produced there's there's siloing this they're archiving it
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:55.600]  doomsday wraps what's that they've created doomsday vaults the Rockefellers and the UN
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:49:03.040]  have right now everything yeah right exactly my my vision is that they may in fact unleash
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:08.480]  some sort of worldwide plague on the plant life on the floor on the floor and then this creates us
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:13.360]  to either be interned underground or in some sort of you know silo or dome situation in which only
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:19.040]  the privileged are given the right kind of food uh etc etc and that person has to be totally conformist
[2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:22.960]  they either wipe out everybody else no that's not let me stop you michael this is the stated
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:28.640]  reverse engineered plan they state you know that they have black op wars they have drug wars to
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.200]  build up the police and they state's terror to expand the criminal control grid then they have
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:38.080]  smaller controlled bio weapon releases to get us into compact cities then they start the real
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:44.240]  mass exterminations that is the stated plan i agree with you there i i i i absolutely have come
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:48.400]  to the same conclusions in my own work that's something along these lines is so people are
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:54.400]  hearing us now thinking we're talking sci-fi this is already happening the the monsanto on the gmo
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:49:59.120]  is all behind us there's something going on and it ties back to what we said about the inability
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:03.360]  to be able to control masses of people through the gun to the head system that has been tried it
[2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:07.280]  doesn't work the next kind of colonialism that we're going to experience the next kind of imperialism
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:12.960]  is going to be a genetic one you know we deal with it in the architecture control dvd it's uh
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:17.680]  that dvd covers a lot of ground actually and it also goes into the psychological question of why
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:21.200]  people lend themselves to this kind of submission i don't know we have time to talk about on you
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:24.400]  know we will we will we have plenty of time we're going to have you back soon we have a whole other
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:30.160]  hour and 10 minutes coming up but but the point you're making monsanto said in 99 in a public
[2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:35.760]  speech it was in major papers that they plan to infect everything so that then no one has a choice
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:40.480]  they admit that this is meant to take over the entire biosphere and with the terminator genes
[2:50:40.480 --> 2:50:47.360]  and others end the regular life cycle the carbon tax is meant to be a tax on humans to to to literally
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:54.080]  say that humans are bad with this new guild of millions per country of environmental enforcers
[2:50:55.040 --> 2:50:59.680]  one child policy all of this i mean i don't think the public understands hitler stalin mal
[2:50:59.680 --> 2:51:04.640]  that was only warm up for what they're getting ready to do well that that's my main point it's
[2:51:04.640 --> 2:51:11.040]  warm up what we're seeing now is just a preliminary tip of the iceberg you know now this uh the
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:16.720]  architecture control dvd is actually dedicated to jim keith and to also ezra pound and these are
[2:51:16.720 --> 2:51:21.280]  two people that are big impact on me because jim keith was always looking at i know you do as well
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:26.560]  at this whole technological leviathan which is one of the greatest clubs in the hands of the elite
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:30.080]  stay there stay there michael disarian we're going to talk behind scenes as well now

[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:54.560]  right now uh it's hard to believe but in my film in game we we only show you the tip of the iceberg
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:54:59.760]  about who these global controllers are i mean how do you get scientists in the u.s and russia
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:04.800]  and everywhere to go nerve gas little children or test radiation on children and kill them or
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:08.640]  test it on troops that isn't about testing the nerve gas they know it'll kill a person or the
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:14.800]  radiation it's about creating cadres of scientists who will buy into this and who enjoy exercising
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:20.880]  the psychopathic power to create larger cadres of subunits to serve the new world order going
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:25.120]  into the mass extermination and i want you know they're claiming al-qaeda did or claim it came out
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:30.080]  of a lab but when you and your family are dying especially you police out there you can at least
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:34.960]  you know realize that for those that survive that the new world order is real and that this really
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:38.560]  happened and that we really warned you we were talking during the break about them not capping
[2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:45.440]  the pyramid in 2000 as they were openly uh worshiping uh what they called anti-beast or
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:50.480]  anamon and you were just talking about that it was on world wide tv fake fire shooting out of
[2:55:50.480 --> 2:55:57.360]  the ground fireworks huge horn demons marching on movie screens uh uh uh at the giza plateau uh
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:04.560]  worldwide uh cultism pbs carried it open lucifer worship on tv and it was like i would mention
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:10.080]  it to people and no one even seemed to care uh michael disorient well exactly right and people
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:15.280]  have to realize that these guys on the highest level you see they operate based on an old stellar
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:20.640]  form of timing based on ancient zodiacs and the whole concept of that when you do something
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:24.960]  the timing has to be right this uh i discovered in the context of island when i was studying
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:30.000]  things like the you know uh the various battles i mean the very fact that the orange parade happens
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:36.160]  you know very close to mid-summer the the mid-summer solstice just like your bohemian uh grove investigation
[2:56:36.160 --> 2:56:40.720]  pointed out that the dates are very important the mid-summer the summer solstice we have the
[2:56:40.720 --> 2:56:45.760]  same issue happening in northern island where the 12th of july parades are scheduled for the
[2:56:45.760 --> 2:56:50.240]  movement of the sun you know to the mid to the to the center point there uh the uh black
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:54.640]  preceptory which is a very secret order behind the orange lords they're they have their ceremonies
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:59.440]  on july 13th this ritualistic element is very very important people will notice that the
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:05.280]  declarations of war whether it's march 17th the feast of parim you see or any other date
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:10.160]  that comes about it's not random it is not done by accident and so the openings of this the
[2:57:10.160 --> 2:57:15.760]  closing of that the signing of the euro dollar you know all the things that the m e p's do
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:20.640]  or the people who control them do is done based on ancient solar and stellar and lunar zodiacs
[2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:25.520]  people have to understand this it's based on ancient masonic timings you know that's we
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:29.920]  gotta understand by the way that comes out mainstream media that oh uh tony blare every
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:33.840]  morning is possessed by the spirit of light he falls on the ground and convulsed he goes to the
[2:57:33.840 --> 2:57:38.320]  four corners of the earth to do weird rituals oh and ronald reagan everything he does is according
[2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:45.120]  to the astrology and you know this all comes out exactly and that's the reason why my life took me
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:49.520]  into those areas to study these secret societies quite intimately to definitely get into these
[2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:54.000]  occult areas to find out what it is that they're up to what are they doing and then and basically
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:58.960]  to pull back from the canvas and discover my god this is a worldwide ritual that involves many many
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:03.520]  tentacles but getting back to the point about this whole technotronic age you know as i said my
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:07.600]  work is dedicated to jim keith and i want i want people to remember his name because he's one of the
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:12.320]  greatest american researchers you could imagine do you believe he was murdered absolutely no
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:16.880]  doubt in my mind and the people closest to him also speculate upon that i know his publisher
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:22.960]  died mysteriously right after he did yes exactly and another another friend of his a co-researcher
[2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:26.800]  was also mysteriously killed so there's no doubt in my mind that they either you know they took
[2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:30.720]  this guy up because he was so special he had the ability and the charm to reach many many people
[2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:37.360]  well he also got wide spectrum analysis yeah i mean he really got the big picture well remember
[2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:42.640]  these guys were tied up jim had investigated phantology and did a runner from it because he knew
[2:58:42.640 --> 2:58:46.640]  you might god what the hell is going on here and then try to whistle blow that and and from there
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:51.280]  you know went on to like i did in my in my own way to you know branch out and to find out about the
[2:58:51.280 --> 2:58:56.720]  world the great the great global conspiracy and his work is fundamental his book uh mass control
[2:58:56.720 --> 2:59:01.520]  you know is essential part of the dvd we're just we're doing right now but the release next month

[3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:01.600]  michael i want to get into a little bit of positive news first then i want to get into the
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:06.160]  technological control grid the enslavement grid what your new films about that that was the bad
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:12.080]  news but knowing the enemy is half the battle but you talk and speak a lot about the exponential
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:18.320]  awakening and listen i tend to underestimate how many people i reach individually and i'm just one
[3:01:18.320 --> 3:01:24.560]  you know little uh uh outposts and all of this i don't over gauge myself but really it doesn't
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:32.240]  matter any guest i call up now some engineer or chuck norris or you know some politician or
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:36.160]  somebody in another country or i go to foreign countries people all the street come up to me
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:40.960]  now you know i go to honduras or i go to england or i go to germany or i go to uh you know some
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:46.800]  other part of the world uh and and and and you just mean i'm one little guy in all this and now
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:51.520]  i mean it's a i mean take austin we know my center of operations it's now where i'll be at the gym
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:56.160]  and 80 percent of the people in there come up and aren't just coming up saying hi they're waking up
[3:01:56.160 --> 3:02:02.800]  they're listening and and and so i see with my own life an exponential explosion in people starting
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:07.440]  to understand there's more to the world than meets the the eye or the mainstream media service
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:12.960]  and so it's it's exponential so i see these two things that you know the global enslavement grid
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:18.880]  coming head to head with a mass human awakening your comments on that well i agree with that
[3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:23.280]  totally otherwise i wouldn't be doing my work it is one of the things i also everything you said is
[3:02:23.280 --> 3:02:28.080]  true for me as well wherever i go the enormous amount of emails and feedback that i get you
[3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:33.760]  know and and even the negative reaction at least that shows me that this juggernaut as i said the
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:38.240]  lights you know must be blinding some people that gives you the reverse understanding that you know
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:42.560]  it must be happening because look at their even the reactions it's causing even in a negative
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:47.360]  way to people you must know that by their threat you can also tell you know by their back lashing
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:52.320]  you can tell my god you know our time has come and i always describe it as being that people have
[3:02:52.320 --> 3:02:57.280]  to stay very optimistic what's happening this can i am not a person who ever believes that evil
[3:02:57.280 --> 3:03:02.400]  will ever triumph in the world because just like nature abhors a vacuum nature also abhors that
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:06.720]  which is evil and if you are evil if you're operating from that mindset you've actually
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:11.840]  just raised a red flag to the powers of nature to say come and get me wipe me out and i also
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:18.160]  believe that we are in the time of the death throes all this kind of you know sphere of activity
[3:03:18.160 --> 3:03:23.440]  this kind of imperialism we're actually it's bad it's hot yep they're up in our face but as a
[3:03:23.440 --> 3:03:28.080]  matter of fact i also believe you see that it's a situation in which these individuals it's their
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:33.840]  they're dying days they're in the last phase of the tyranny and that you know it's a situation
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:39.280]  that we're gonna we're gonna you know overcome it and it's just i don't necessarily see i don't
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:43.040]  entertain any other idea at all because i wouldn't be wasting my time on five minutes
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:47.040]  of any of this research if i didn't totally and utterly believe that good always triumphs over
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:51.440]  evil and it will do and that these people are evil and my message is that we have to study
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:56.240]  the nature of evil yeah a person can be good but a person could also be good and stupid or good
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:01.120]  and blind the point is now that the awakening continues as we pass the torch from one person
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:05.680]  to the other we get our arms around as much information as we can we do not bicker because
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:10.320]  we have minute differences we're all on camp here i said this is one of my talks in los angeles
[3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:15.680]  you know we're all we all have our tents and camped upon the battlefield we have a common
[3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:20.080]  enemy to fight let us not then bicker and fight up amongst ourselves which is exactly what the
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:24.240]  enemy on the other side of the valley wants us to do and which is expert at creating situations
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:28.720]  in which we do this we've got to understand the fifth columnist the agent provocateurs
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:32.480]  who come in to put you know pit one side of the research community against another
[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:36.000]  that's why the internet is infested with these kinds of people these so-called debunkers these
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:41.760]  so-called uh swami uh slimy you know so-called internet assassins i mean i've often said that
[3:04:41.760 --> 3:04:46.560]  you know behind every garbage can is a critic well inside every garbage can is a you know a
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:52.480]  debunker and these people are the ones who are like the frozen deer you know the toothless piranhas
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:56.960]  that are stifling well you know that they never give any proof either you know we're saying we're
[3:04:56.960 --> 3:05:00.720]  waking up they don't have any proof that we're affecting true i know but people who are really
[3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:05.520]  doing it are are waking people up they're involved they're saying let's work together but the enemy
[3:05:05.520 --> 3:05:09.360]  will attack you and then say oh we should work together why aren't you working together you know
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:14.240]  that you know they never it's just unbelievable but it's not just conscious enemy operatives
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:20.400]  there are a lot of just broken down morbid uh malfunctioning minds out there that you know
[3:05:20.400 --> 3:05:25.680]  also have all come to the new world order but still just thrash about attacking everyone
[3:05:25.680 --> 3:05:29.520]  we're going to continue with michael disarian michael disarian dot com's website stay with us

[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:44.720]  okay we got about 51 minutes left with michael disarian great researcher michael disarian dot
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:51.280]  com michael break down the technological control grid the microwave guns the face scanning cameras
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:58.800]  the poison in the food and water all of it admitted all of it being intensified one in 33 having cancer
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:04.000]  now one in two and men one in three and women you know just all i mean the plagues are upon us
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:11.600]  it is engineered uh... break down this uh... grid well this uh... you know like i said coming out
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:15.920]  of the work of jim keith and the people who had more of a look at this technotronic world and you
[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:19.760]  even have some of the insiders talking about that they can't wait for this people of the burton
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:24.400]  russell school you see and the whole bread and circus clan the intellectual types what i've
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:28.560]  been studying is more the elite type of people at the top of the pyramid what is it what is
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:32.000]  their thinking what do they want how do they see mankind you know the people coming out of the
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:36.560]  thomas mouthful school the people coming out of the frankfurt schools and the tavas dark institute
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:42.400]  and these highbrows who have always looked at us as some sort of subhuman animalistic kind of being
[3:09:42.400 --> 3:09:46.720]  i mean i don't want to get into it right now but my work even tracks the whole genetic interference
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:51.920]  with mankind back thousands of years ago so what we're seeing now with the the industrial age and
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:57.360]  now we're in the silicon age and we have all these mITs and sun corporations you see in all of this
[3:09:57.360 --> 3:10:03.200]  effort to look at our genes and to present the gene to us in a very subliminally negative way
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:09.760]  as some sort of mechanical construct that is just you know like a leg it's broken we're bad and for
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:16.720]  those that don't know they would uh... two thousand years ago in Rome breed large brutish quote dumb
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:21.520]  uh... germans galls and others you know together when the slaves are mainly white
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:25.520]  and then uh... it's openly in the slave manuals very politically incorrect to say but it's actually
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:31.040]  history i'm not saying it worked but they actually did also breed people in this country to be large
[3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:35.760]  and stupid according to what the official documents say go ahead that's right that this is where
[3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:39.840]  they're at this is what you know jim keeps work really a lot of me to the doctor delgato's these
[3:10:39.840 --> 3:10:44.640]  frankensteinian you know uh... bella legosi creatures that you know haunt the technical
[3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:49.040]  world that a huge amount of funding and what really caught my eye because as i told you before
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:52.720]  my introduction to a lot of this has been through art and through symbolism i started to notice
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:56.640]  that the symbolism that these you know alex de graze and these individuals were now behind the
[3:10:56.640 --> 3:11:02.000]  whole genome project and many other technological sort of projects and organizations right from
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:06.720]  the time of france's quick doing his main research in the in the template zones of london and then
[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:10.720]  the first genetic experiments being done in the template areas of scotland near rosslin
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:15.360]  you know this kind of stuff start to irritate you know start to like a razor red flag for me
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:19.200]  because here we're up against the template symbolism again here we're seeing the holy grail
[3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:23.280]  symbolism again here we're seeing the man in white with the red crosses what is all of this
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:27.440]  what does that got to do with any of this so then i started you know tracking that and got into the
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:31.280]  work of jim keeps and others who start talking about that look the assault on the human race
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:35.840]  has been unconsciousness but it's also been on biology and anyone who stands up against the fda
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:40.400]  the am a any of the dr raymond royal rights the wilhelm rights the walter russells you know the
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:45.600]  max gerson's the the list is endless of anyone who stands up to say here's how he real healing
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:50.560]  happens here's how you get you know back to your your center both not only legal sovereignty in a
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:55.680]  social sense but spiritual sovereignty you know they they suppress and molest those people they
[3:11:55.680 --> 3:12:00.720]  burn their works they purge them they do not let their knowledge be known so that some of the
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:05.120]  attacks on the human beings see we have to understand the nature of evil and and understand
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:11.040]  the hydra that is not just attacking in one way in fact often as many as archibald wave all the
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:14.960]  general said watch what the right hand is doing because you're not seeing the left hand they may
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:20.000]  present in front of you some sort of bugbear some sort of you know um what's it it's like
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.640]  wizard of all shadow for you to be you know shaking in front of but the real enemy is coming at you
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:28.800]  from the back so this is what i've also been studying and i really do believe that this
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:34.320]  post-human world is upon us whether the global village is upon us i mean that that comes out of
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:39.600]  my studies of fabianism and study of the common purpose and all of that so but the global village
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:44.960]  can be many things they may not even put chains on you they may not even build a wall around you
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:49.520]  but you can still inhabit this planet as a global slave in the global village there's many ways of
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:55.120]  attaining this and through these rfi chips the whole situation of the whole digital kingdom
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:13:00.080]  opening up for us this is what's going to break next speed since they sort of falling back of the
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:04.560]  main military budgets we're not not too much falling back on it but as obviously they scale
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:08.000]  back from star wars and these other things what do you think all that money's going that money is
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:14.800]  now going into the whole technological you know world to create for human race basically a cyber
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:20.720]  purgatory which is going to be what supplants this ending that i've talked about in the next four to
[3:13:20.720 --> 3:13:25.440]  five years you're going to see a sort of a countdown to extinction of all the traditions
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.920]  all the accepted norms that our forefathers work for that we've understood there are grandparents
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:34.560]  and our parents this is both an education but specifically in medical just look at the way
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:39.120]  that children are medicated up the eyeballs right now you know i mean the complete the
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:44.560]  struggle there's even one slug from uh the stanford university he wants to start introducing
[3:13:44.560 --> 3:13:53.920]  the you know the anti uh you know the ad d the pills the drugs before children even show the
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:59.280]  symptoms of it he already wants to put them on that no there's already a drugging of children in
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:06.640]  utero if they quote from poor families in oregon which is eugenics right exactly this goes back
[3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:12.320]  to marie stokes right back to the whole fabian situation you know and back to the uh and what
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:18.400]  it is these are really murderous bloodthirsty control freaks who just have disdain and arrogance
[3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:21.520]  for everyone and i've actually talked to some of these top scientists and elitists from these big
[3:14:21.520 --> 3:14:27.360]  families that they're almost mentally retarded in a way they're gibbering they're they're goblin like
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:32.880]  and they're not even that smart they're just vicious vicious little demons well the more empty you
[3:14:32.880 --> 3:14:37.600]  are we respect will have rights a little man the more little you are the more fearful you are the
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:41.680]  more that you need to exercise these controls that is the wizard of our shadow situation
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:45.120]  and people need to wake up turn on the lights and not be afraid of that type of thing it ties
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:49.680]  into the awakening that you spoke of you know in the previous segment here and that is happening
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:54.800]  it needs to continue to happen and as i say i'm very adamant of people do not territorialize
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:59.840]  this knowledge first of all this is an alternative subject well the way deal with it is not mainstream
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:03.760]  it is not fundamentalistic you're not going to territorialize it it does not belong to you
[3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:08.960]  it is knowledge and you can't bring the same old old world you know paradigms of old and control
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:13.120]  into this area you don't belong go and study go back to school you know and go back into the
[3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:17.120]  orthodox world is my message to those people i notice people always try to get information
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:22.160]  i notice people always in our own being a quote you know awakening movement you know
[3:15:22.160 --> 3:15:28.880]  reality movement uh whatever you want to call it they always try to tear to territorialize it
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:34.080]  about who said when nine eleven was going to happen first or who discovered this or who
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:38.640]  discovered that and me i'm always happy to have folks on give them credit but i do that
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:43.120]  almost neurotically just to please those that are keeping score on who came up with this or
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:48.000]  who thought of this first i mean i have trailblaze thousands of things coin terms but it means
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:54.320]  nothing to me i'm hoping people use it i'm hoping people expand on my knowledge as i expanded on
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:58.720]  others stand on my shoulders as i stood on others but you're right there's this obsession
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:03.360]  with territorializing uh and i've done the opposite i've said make copies of my films do
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:09.040]  whatever you want use my material don't even give me credit because it's about survival
[3:16:09.040 --> 3:16:15.040]  i mean again people can wake up at the new world order but they haven't woken up to all the conditioning
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:20.400]  they were already under it so they've got to break that as well well they gotta they're walking
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:25.360]  towards see the word utopia if you actually look up the meaning of the word utopia as it was first
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:30.800]  meant to mean it actually means no place and this of course then opened up this would not have been
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:34.960]  understood when francis bacon you know coined the term or used it it certainly makes a lot of
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:39.680]  sense now because we have virtual kingdoms we have fiber you know uh the purgatory is
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:44.720]  waiting for us we have these virtual reality states in which man so divorced from his own center
[3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:48.960]  so what divorced from his own spirit not only divorced but running headlong away in the opposite
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:54.640]  direction from his spirit what do you think is waiting there for him these you know these individuals
[3:16:54.640 --> 3:16:59.440]  are wanting to create a perfect social global village in which you can upload your own consciousness
[3:16:59.440 --> 3:17:03.360]  so the internet is you know one aspect of this it's not negative but it's an extension of the
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:08.560]  three-bolt spinal system as many scholars have shown the way they're engineering the
[3:17:08.560 --> 3:17:14.560]  technocracy used to dominate and subjugate and dumb down so we're not demonizing technology
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:20.400]  one way or the other but the architect know of it has been designed for bad there is there is no
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:25.200]  doubting that and we're being inserted into the false reality when our whole development is about
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:31.360]  this plane of existence and we need to maintain that we can certainly expand but we need to
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:37.040]  maintain and expand our core will not give up our core of who we are to quote expand into something
[3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:41.840]  else because that will destroy who we really are right and we often because again of the misuse of
[3:17:41.840 --> 3:17:46.880]  terms because of the media's complicity and all of this we often think of technology as being
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:51.360]  nothing to do with spirituality in fact spirit and technology are two words for the same thing
[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:55.680]  if you go back in history you'll notice the emphasis of technology when it's used to write
[3:17:55.680 --> 3:18:00.800]  to build pyramids to feed the poor you see to irrigate great rivers i mean technology was in
[3:18:00.800 --> 3:18:05.600]  the hands of all of the most spiritual people in the past it's being sequestered it's being
[3:18:05.600 --> 3:18:10.000]  repackaged it's being sort of territorialized and owned by those who are the darkest of powers it
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:14.160]  doesn't belong to them the great samurai you know the people who could make the great swords in the
[3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:19.280]  past the great horsemen or the great you know whatever the musicians the musicology the creators
[3:18:19.280 --> 3:18:23.920]  of instruments you know all of this is technology isn't it so technology surrounds us as part of
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:28.400]  who we are but it also has a spiritual component it needs to be back in the hands of the people
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:32.960]  who are spiritual not in the hands of all these demonic people who are using it to you know destroy
[3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:37.600]  the humanity that's right we are a species who envisions and then creates we are a
[3:18:37.600 --> 3:18:42.480]  exactly magical species compared to everything else on this planet as neat as dolphins are they've
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:48.240]  got nothing on homo sapien sapien and the enemy has to blunt and dumb down that creativity and
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:54.320]  get us focused off into issues of no significance or brute bestial lower level making that you know
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:19:00.880]  through the mammalian image you know through the peer pressure to be that lower man instead of that
[3:19:00.880 --> 3:19:06.320]  higher man and they claim that they are building a world for a higher man when the entire architecture
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:13.360]  is to destroy what man is and feed us into a technocratic meat rider you got it on the michael
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:18.640]  to sign website people see an article there called weapons of mass destruction found and it addresses
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:22.720]  this whole concept between the magic and the sorcery i refer to what they're doing is sorcery
[3:19:22.720 --> 3:19:28.720]  black sorcery basically these people are possessed by a kind of archon a demonic force that they
[3:19:28.720 --> 3:19:32.960]  serve or they've you can look at it the other way that they have basically uploaded their own
[3:19:32.960 --> 3:19:38.160]  consciousness into that place into that place of fear envy endless greed endless darkness it
[3:19:38.160 --> 3:19:41.520]  doesn't matter which way you look at it either something's possessed them or they have uploaded
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:45.680]  their consciousness they what they've done is they've murdered their own spirit psychologically
[3:19:45.680 --> 3:19:50.960]  and then by doing that you allow this dark sorcery to enter into you well you can look at it either
[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:55.920]  way but the the sum result is the infected the person who is that infected by that spiritual
[3:19:55.920 --> 3:20:00.080]  virus cannot sit still this is what the people of america in the world need to understand
[3:20:00.080 --> 3:20:04.880]  that kind of infected person cannot sit still unless they go around and try to infect everybody
[3:20:04.880 --> 3:20:08.880]  else the thing makes sense when you look at a psychological point of view faith without works
[3:20:08.880 --> 3:20:14.000]  is dead and that goes for the dark side and the light side i mean people are going to manifest
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:19.520]  and build what their core is and and then notice the occultist at the higher levels want to make
[3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:24.880]  everybody low level atheist and not believe any of that so that blinds us but at the top the real
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:30.080]  top atheists and people are wild satanic luciferians we're going to skip this break too behind the

[3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:48.160]  you know i take myself as a microcosm of a journey of awakening
[3:24:49.600 --> 3:24:57.120]  some people misinterpret what i'm doing as fear no fear would put people in their box in a catatonic
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:04.000]  state in a field position not moving forward why has alex jones for all my foibles and and problems
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:08.480]  why have i been the most effective and i i think that's universally pretty much accepted even by
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:13.200]  my detractors on all fronts there's the most effective at waking people up well it's because
[3:25:13.200 --> 3:25:17.760]  i reached out to the people of the united states in the world and taught them and showed them
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:22.080]  how much power they had and and and how much they could do to wake up others and that's why
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:27.520]  it's you the listeners and the visitors of info wars dot com prison planet dot com so you judge
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:31.120]  a tree by its fruits we have really resisted the new world order had a lot of victories against
[3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:36.080]  them woken up a lot of people and it's because i have passion and i am aggressive and i am angry
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:44.480]  and i shake people out of the mesmerized position they're in with the tv and the culture
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:50.160]  to then just kind of like a cold bucket of water ice water wake them up and and and and and and
[3:25:50.160 --> 3:25:56.160]  shake them out of that and michael to sari and david ike many others have also been very very
[3:25:56.160 --> 3:26:04.960]  successful at doing this so so what are your ideas of of of how to fight this technocracy
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:09.120]  i mean i want people to see how dangerous it is and know what a great threat it is so they will
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:15.680]  move out of the way of the threat and then over it and on top of it and you know to to to to
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:23.280]  denature it um i mean what are your ideas of of how this revolution of human and you know
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:29.200]  consciousness uh... yeah how this is going to play out and what are your ideas in the solution
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:34.400]  well see whatever whatever you want to call it god nature has already given us the tools
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:39.040]  is called a human reason it's called the human curiosity this has built the greatest bridges
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:44.240]  is you know created the shuttle it has built the greatest nations on earth has built pyramids
[3:26:44.240 --> 3:26:50.240]  we already have the hardware the hardware within us installed but what has happened is we've been
[3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:55.040]  conditioned to not use it to doubt our own sensibilities to doubt our own bodies to doubt
[3:26:55.040 --> 3:26:58.800]  that we have control over our own lives and our own families and our own communities
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:02.800]  and this has been the insipid drip feeding seal of the lie i'm going to back up and talk about
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:06.800]  what you just said there about being angry you know and first of all i don't have a i do not
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:10.720]  have a degree in psychology but i've studied the subject thoroughly and i can tell you that you
[3:27:10.720 --> 3:27:15.920]  alex are neither mad nor paranoid and that you are a person who's got the guts to stand up and be as
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:20.880]  mad as hell who can deal with channel or anger positively and this is what is needed maybe
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:25.440]  go back to the movie network you gotta be as mad as hell you gotta fall in love with the word no
[3:27:25.440 --> 3:27:30.160]  you gotta ask questions and you gotta do it with anyone else comes to help you do it or not
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:34.400]  and this is very vital you know as i said all the men from my country fought in the war of
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:39.680]  independence and this war to me is still going on and people need to be armed up because something
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:43.920]  is shooting at us something is taking away that which is most precious and therefore something
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:48.080]  has to be done and you have to be as mad as hell but you also have to channel that madness
[3:27:48.080 --> 3:27:53.680]  and that the the healthy anger and be armed up to fight this kind of tiger in the long grass it
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:57.760]  is not something that's going to make itself known you could easily shoot in the wrong direction
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:02.240]  you see so people need to be armed up with knowledge and education and i will not stand in
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:06.720]  my life you see which is happening a lot i see in the world that these people who come into this
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:11.040]  subject either they're bandwagon hoppers or like we said there may be debunkers or whatever
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:15.040]  or they may just be a bunch of intellectuals who try to come there you know with the same
[3:28:15.040 --> 3:28:18.480]  rules that they knew in the college and the university and the mainstream jumping through
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:22.320]  the hoops and then they come into this world and go where's your qualifications you know uh
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:26.960]  what kind of books and DVDs have you written or done you know and they want to territorialize
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:29.920]  this knowledge and they want to make you jump through the hoops and my message to you see
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:34.800]  i've always told just like you do the average person take action be a leader you know it can
[3:28:34.800 --> 3:28:39.520]  do incredible things and the enemy hates that that i tell people that they're empowered individually
[3:28:39.520 --> 3:28:43.360]  they try to misquote me and misinterpret and claim that i'm saying that people don't have
[3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:48.960]  power no i'm saying you do have power you do affect change you can change the world around you
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:55.360]  well you see back at one of the earliest uh models one of the earliest models of the ancient irish
[3:28:55.360 --> 3:29:01.280]  is very simple and it said in gaelic but i'll translate in english it is deeds to match words
[3:29:01.280 --> 3:29:09.920]  and this is the fact that here we are in a situation of colossal attack on the human race
[3:29:09.920 --> 3:29:13.440]  we are literally dealing with the death of america if we're not careful you know at least
[3:29:13.440 --> 3:29:18.080]  the death of the the the america that was known and built by the forefathers and people are sitting
[3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:23.680]  there passively and and twittering and howling and screeching about meaningless crap they got to
[3:29:23.680 --> 3:29:28.240]  get up other damn ass is what i say you know people do they do exactly what you're doing so
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:32.480]  i'm hoping that people will model themselves on you you know what happens when people watch
[3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:36.960]  you know what was what was the reality back in 1950s you know people like me and in britain
[3:29:36.960 --> 3:29:41.600]  alex grew up watching the home for bogart you know movies that jimmy cagney movies when people in
[3:29:41.600 --> 3:29:45.120]  america looked you right in the eye and told you where to get off what the hell happened how did
[3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:49.200]  everything get become so politically correct and so after mine well notice the mainstream
[3:29:49.200 --> 3:29:53.600]  media always tells us be passive don't be aggressive don't stand up for yourself but
[3:29:53.600 --> 3:29:57.840]  meanwhile the government is aggressive and pushy towards us they're letting us know they're the

[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:35.920]  michael tasarian.com uh michael i want to go to some calls here in about 10 minutes or so but
[3:36:35.920 --> 3:36:40.400]  continue with the technological control grid and and and you talk about them clamping down the next
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:44.880]  three years or so really i mean people think we've already seen an intensification of operations
[3:36:44.880 --> 3:36:49.680]  by the globalist you're talking about you know really intensifying things break that down for us
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:54.880]  well these are people who've always thought of man as some sort of golem you know the story of the
[3:36:54.880 --> 3:37:00.480]  golem and even coming out of the new age movement all this stuff about the graves you know i believe
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:05.440]  that that's been infiltrated and a lot of that is disinformation you know to you know prepare us to
[3:37:05.440 --> 3:37:10.560]  be not only afraid of course of some sort of off-world invasion that you know that is science fiction
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:15.440]  but it works well to prepare people for what's coming but basically when you start reading the
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:20.320]  certain schools of Bertrand Russell's and these kinds of people and these other maniacs that i deal
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:26.800]  with and you know my my work throughout my books and dvds these individuals literally do think of
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:33.040]  themselves as some sort of robotic mechanical beings and nothing could be there in their greatest
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:38.000]  pipe dreams you see is to make a completely controllable human being i actually believe
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:44.800]  that for ritual purposes certain segments of these illumined ones so-called wanted to completely
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:49.680]  devastate and wipe out the human race a long time ago and that another quadrant another you know section
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:54.320]  or cadre sort of you know frowned upon that in the past and didn't want that and came up with the
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:38:00.000]  idea that look to make the perfect robot all we got to do is dumb down the people of the world
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:05.120]  to the level of the robot to the level of the cyborg and the job is done and that's basically
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:10.480]  where we're at that's where we've been up until now now they have restored the technology because
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:15.600]  remember these people arm themselves to the teeth with not only knowledge but occult knowledge
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:22.080]  and so that what what i am not a person who's a ludic I am all for technology but I do not want
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:27.040]  technology in the hands of occultists who are working from you know occult knowledge and
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:30.960]  then arming themselves with this technology this is the problem and this is also a message to those
[3:38:30.960 --> 3:38:35.680]  who are working in these technological sort of enclaves they got to be aware of this and research
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:41.040]  this to find out about the occult ideologies that are behind these technical orbs and behind some
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:45.680]  of these you know people's champions within the genome project and with some of these
[3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:51.120]  materialist philosophers and scientists who are just itching to create the global village
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:38:56.240]  and that through the electronics through the technologies through the cybernetics you see
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:00.160]  and this is actually an old story people are familiar with the work I did in my atlanta's book
[3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:06.160]  knows that this is a very old story that these cybernetics and cryogenics and the genetic manipulation
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:11.840]  is not something new it's just that they've had to build back the technology at a record pace now
[3:39:11.840 --> 3:39:16.960]  you know in the chronology of time and they're succeeding to do this and that is why they I
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:21.520]  believe they have postponed certain other events because they wanted the tunnel vision on this
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:25.440]  particular thing it's backed up by the work of Jim Keith and these people that I've been mentioning
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:29.440]  a lot here and we've got to realize you see that this is coming down it's not just with
[3:39:29.440 --> 3:39:34.640]  arming the police with super weapons it's not just putting dog you know hot technology and
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:39.600]  microwave technology installing that on the satellites so that they have a complete police
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:45.200]  state global village situation in which no nation or no person can operate independently you see
[3:39:45.200 --> 3:39:49.600]  and then they troubleshoot this they check it out in the terrestrial wars that are going on on the
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:54.560]  planet these black operations that have been exposed they call them laboratories they call it
[3:39:54.560 --> 3:40:00.960]  the laboratory they call a war laboratory yeah that's it so they want this particular being
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:06.720]  you know magnetized vaccinated uh you know injected and completely you know digitized
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:11.360]  so that they can then control every aspect of what you're doing here's one microcosm here's one
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:17.120]  microcosm example the gmo milk the gmo food the plastics and there's hundreds of types of plastics
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:22.560]  they pick for worldwide distribution over 90 percent of the plastic cups the one type of plastic
[3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:28.720]  that sheds the estrogen mimicking hormones it's a documented fact they chose it 40 years ago
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:32.880]  for that reason that's come out and then three year old girls four year old girls by the tens of
[3:40:32.880 --> 3:40:39.120]  thousands by the millions at seven eight nine are going into puberty early then they get breast
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:43.760]  cancer early you know they get so early and then they know all that and when they go to the doctor
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:47.840]  they don't say quit drinking gmo milk they don't say quit drinking out of plastic they say oh we're
[3:40:47.840 --> 3:40:55.200]  going to give you hardcore complex uh hormonal injections that then suppress that but then also
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:41:02.080]  give you cushing's disease and fry all your uh glands and so again they engineer that the local
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:06.480]  doctor's departmentalized he doesn't know and they give the little girl something that's far worse
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:12.640]  meanwhile our boys are are in so much estrogen that now they've got 10 12 14 15 year old boys whose
[3:41:12.640 --> 3:41:16.240]  testicles haven't dropped that i hate to get technical but they're like ovaries they're still
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:20.160]  inside the body uh when normally you know testicles should drop when you're about eight and nine right
[3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:26.240]  before you go into puberty at 12 i mean they are attacking us the frogs the fish off the water we drink
[3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:32.080]  are now becoming sterile and mash i mean we are on this is scientific we have the sperm countdown
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:36.560]  75 percent in the western world 85 percent many areas i mean the proofs in the pudding
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:42.880]  absolutely i couldn't agree more and it goes to this whole idea of the hark of tyranny the origin
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:48.800]  of tyranny and that the human race is their chattel to do with as they feel like and they don't
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:53.680]  want disgruntled people they want a totally pacified you know and dumbed down individual
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:42:00.320]  that they can completely own and you see they know that they also never sit quiet they know
[3:42:00.320 --> 3:42:04.640]  that there's an awakening taking place so these guys just don't let that happen they have to also
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:09.200]  you know arm themselves to react against the awakening that there's one earlier where they're
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:13.760]  going to put all these satellite trackers all the cars the taxes and from government study and he
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:20.640]  was going it's okay it's not coming for a long time it may not even happen this is good for you
[3:42:20.640 --> 3:42:26.480]  i mean and it's always the same script it's always the same script and i i tie it into the
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:30.320]  awakening you know i said this in one of my talks that's entitled the origins of evil
[3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:35.040]  and in the first 10 minutes of that talk i said that look as the human child starts to awaken
[3:42:35.040 --> 3:42:40.400]  and tries to gain back his spirit that is exactly at the point where the monster the vampire comes
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:46.720]  in they're waiting there to infuse you with more you know toxicity so that you again fall into your
[3:42:46.720 --> 3:42:50.560]  but see that said they want you to fall into the sleep and that's why you're effective why i'm
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:55.920]  effective we're shaking them going no wake up don't even believe me just you're being manipulated
[3:42:55.920 --> 3:42:59.920]  by madison avenue by the culture by the propaganda and if you can't even admit that when it's
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:05.600]  admitted there's much more advanced things we're shocking them saying you need to realize what's
[3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:11.200]  going on with their needs to be that urgency for people to get out you know like i knew cell
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:14.800]  phones were frying my brain but i kept using them i finally got to where i i check my message is
[3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:19.520]  about once a day on it i keep it far away from me my wife isn't using hers anymore we're living
[3:43:19.520 --> 3:43:24.960]  without it it tracks us it hurts us you know i could break my habit we can all do this and it
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:29.920]  takes the urgency michael yeah but when you have a media that turns around and shows you
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:34.240]  bill gates wife is you know injecting her dog with a microchip and then suddenly it's not the dog
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:38.480]  anymore it's the children just like you showed on road to tyranny you had that stupid gormless
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:44.160]  la family who goes this is just wonderful i can't wait you know it's going to save abduction it's
[3:43:44.160 --> 3:43:48.240]  going to save the kidnapping it's going to save your dog you know the human race is dumb enough
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:52.560]  to be turned ago yeah i want one too where can i get it you know by the way it turns out it turns
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:57.600]  out that was all fake and then the family worked for applied digital solution and ibm front director
[3:43:57.600 --> 3:44:03.840]  it and then magically magically members of the family started dying how about that well this is
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:07.360]  the casualty list they never let they never publicized that about all the like they said
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:11.040]  with the estrogen that are pumping into the girls and then these court cases that they
[3:44:11.040 --> 3:44:15.120]  are backed up because there's been so much you know reactions and these children and
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:19.440]  these young people i'm very concerned about this whole medicated child bit i do a lot of work on
[3:44:19.440 --> 3:44:24.800]  that a lot of research that's what the hpv is a live cancer virus it's killing a bunch of people
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:29.680]  maiming tens of thousands and they knew it would do that they rolled it out as a test of how to
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:34.720]  cover it up how to suppress it how to have these soft kill weapons being openly used out in the
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:39.840]  public and testing how to compartmentalize it and cover it up and they tried on different
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:44.240]  populations of the world remember not one type of virus is not going to work well on different
[3:44:44.240 --> 3:44:49.280]  kinds of nations different kinds of people i can tell you you know i'm i'm i'm sorry i know you
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:53.840]  know this that from the age of ours down from the bird flues and from all of this other stuff
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:45:00.480]  these are rehearsals for the worldwide plague they're testing how soft kills move you're at
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:05.760]  go ahead absolutely right yeah they're ready to unleash a global plague you know the science fiction
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:09.600]  writers have already written about it and try to warn people and this is the perfect way through
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:13.280]  food it's through food there's an old statement that says that people are three meals away from
[3:45:13.280 --> 3:45:17.840]  revolution this was brought out in movies like three days of the condor some people have used it
[3:45:17.840 --> 3:45:22.800]  in the context of oil but oil is hell of a lot less important than the food you know sort of
[3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:27.360]  down a clease that these people are going to use because they're sequestering the the organic
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:33.040]  seeds now just like in some sort of hideous you know Noah's Ark experiment we've got the facts
[3:45:33.040 --> 3:45:36.800]  on this we've got the proof on this they're working overtime on it well James Bond was he
[3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:42.000]  in Fleming OSS and then in the MI6 and they love to throw it in your face and every one of those
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:49.360]  movies later some manifestation of reality within me shown and remember moon raker where the global
[3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:54.480]  elitist want to kill everybody and then repopulate the earth that's right all the way from the first
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:59.200]  one and you know the Her Majesty's Secret Service all the way up to the moon raker you're right
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:02.800]  they're whistleblowing us through the films they want to tell because remember this is a ritual
[3:46:02.800 --> 3:46:08.160]  situation you need to tell the sacrificial goat what an earth is happening here that's the lesser
[3:46:08.160 --> 3:46:14.960]  magic yeah that's the lesser magic they have to do that first yeah i totally agree with this
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:19.280]  and that's what basically our job is our job is not to territorialize knowledge not to jump
[3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:23.040]  through hoops but to try and collate a lot of this information presented for people
[3:46:23.040 --> 3:46:29.200]  you know in an unbiased way and the enemy are in their own prison they are habitualized they are
[3:46:29.200 --> 3:46:33.840]  very obsessive compulsive they do everything the same over and over again i think that's their
[3:46:33.840 --> 3:46:38.320]  weakness michael well right remember earlier on you said that there's something wrong with them
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:43.440]  there's something sort of inhuman about them this i believe ties into a an experimentation that
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:48.240]  happened in ancient times in which certain beings were created these are the world rulers today and
[3:46:48.240 --> 3:46:53.120]  they don't even have what we would refer to a spirit or soul so we got to deal with we've got
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:46:57.920]  to understand that we're talking about people here who are you know connected to to sorcery
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:03.680]  and to dynastic concerns that have sworn themselves to this kind of control for years they look at us
[3:47:03.680 --> 3:47:09.120]  like some people look at the pets like the laboratory you know the doctor looks at the rats in
[3:47:09.120 --> 3:47:13.840]  the maze that is exactly how the human race is to them and it's something that needs to be controlled
[3:47:13.840 --> 3:47:17.680]  and there's not in their mind any question about it that's the way it has to go because they look
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:23.280]  at us as untidy unruly you know they look at us as just like cannon fodder they always have done
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:27.440]  and people need to understand that the movement of imperialism the movement of tyranny involves
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:34.240]  this invasion of our particular biological sovereignty and our mental and spiritual sovereignty
[3:47:34.240 --> 3:47:40.000]  just as much as it does working on a legal political sphere of action people tend to focus
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:44.640]  on that you know what's happening now is i hope that people can start to see the spiritual components
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:49.840]  of this and realize that there is an occult war taking place and it's on everything that is good
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:55.120]  well the bottom line is folks you can believe us or not that war is being waged against you by the
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:00.080]  technocratic elite whether it's real or not they're all into the occult they believe into it
[3:48:00.080 --> 3:48:03.440]  you know they believe what they're saying when michael's telling you's true i mean i don't know
[3:48:03.440 --> 3:48:09.200]  how true it is in facts but they believe it they believe they're another species and they believe
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:13.680]  your baby is a piece of crap that needs to be killed and and and they're coming for us they're
[3:48:13.680 --> 3:48:17.680]  already attacking us they brainwashed the cops the military they brainwashed a lot of them are
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.320]  waking up we didn't make it this way everything we've told you's come true so far we're telling
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:26.720]  us going to get a lot more crazy and then you better realize this is life and death let's take
[3:48:26.720 --> 3:48:31.760]  some calls mick in pennsylvania you're on the air with michael's asarian thank you very much
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:36.880]  i'm in an effort to be for speed i'm going to kind of babble quick uh it seems like the controlled
[3:48:36.880 --> 3:48:42.800]  media is the most useful tool in their toolbox and if we could do you think there's any way
[3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:48.480]  we could possibly we have to come up some way to break up that monopoly perhaps through the use of
[3:48:48.480 --> 3:48:53.520]  their own fairness doctrine because we don't have much like yeah but they're going to selectively
[3:48:53.520 --> 3:48:58.000]  enforce that and use that to shut me down that's all that was always selectively used we need to
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:02.880]  intensify the web not let them take it over not take it for granted while we still have it right
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:07.920]  now uh you know uh just each of you individually waking up friends and neighbors and family is
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:12.400]  an unstoppable force there are leaders out there listening right now that will dwarf
[3:49:12.400 --> 3:49:17.360]  what michael's asarian alex jones and many others have done okay you just have to start the fight
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:23.680]  start the battle and that will lead you into just amazing opportunities oh thank you um
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:30.960]  i'm just real quick in all his research the israeli identity message of the european races
[3:49:30.960 --> 3:49:39.040]  actually being the supposedly lost tribes of israel yes i think well let me get michael to
[3:49:39.040 --> 3:49:45.280]  comment but let me just comment we told you the queen of england is coronated on uh what is the
[3:49:45.280 --> 3:49:52.640]  stone of jacob where we're supposedly uh abraham was going to sacrificing and so yes they believe
[3:49:52.640 --> 3:49:57.440]  that this goes back to the merovingian line you want to explain this well you're totally right
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:02.000]  i was just going to say that that we are in the hands of people who are domestically linked to
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:07.120]  these merovingians who themselves their ancestry goes all the way back into egypt and mc you know
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:11.680]  if you pick up my book on the arish origins of civilization you'll have an enlightening experience
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:15.440]  because you see when people like yourself ask questions like this it's very important to
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:20.560]  identify the terms who are the 12 tribes of israel who are the lost tribes of israel what we got to
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:24.800]  do is analyze those very terms and find out who are we really talking about because the image
[3:50:24.800 --> 3:50:30.800]  that's been presented to us from official sources is not even the true image that's a made for tv made
[3:50:30.800 --> 3:50:35.200]  for the history books you know uh sort of a description of who these people actually are
[3:50:35.200 --> 3:50:40.000]  that's like a sort of a dance on a theater but you got to understand those are actors who what
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:45.040]  lies behind the real tribes and then there's the counterfeit you bet yeah and we've been
[3:50:45.040 --> 3:50:49.440]  handed the counterfeit the time has come now to look behind the the passion play and find out who
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:53.280]  is really operating behind these sort of you know as you say that the lost tribes you know it's a
[3:50:53.280 --> 3:50:58.720]  fascinating story of who the real jews are who the real jew dex are we're using those terms as
[3:50:58.720 --> 3:51:02.720]  has been handed down to us from the from the establishment we're they're not even the correct
[3:51:02.720 --> 3:51:07.920]  terms so often when we're banding terms around like this we're not even using as a true occult
[3:51:07.920 --> 3:51:12.560]  definition this is the biggest problem what does a jew the word mean to a freemason is a totally
[3:51:12.560 --> 3:51:16.800]  different meaning of that word than it is to say that layman on the streets you see so the
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:22.160]  definition of terms is a research is a is a time to study to find out you know first of all we're
[3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:27.360]  not even using the right definition michael buseri and final segment coming up more of your phone

[3:54:42.160 --> 3:54:45.760]  man i was going to overdrive right now but i've got a tape at interview with tech mars
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:50.720]  myself for this show right when the show ends i was on mancow this morning
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:57.120]  they say no rest for the wicked i'm not very wicked i don't get very much rest it's kind of
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:02.560]  the opposite michael isary and i was bringing up standing up against evil how that is empowering
[3:55:02.560 --> 3:55:08.000]  now once you just love humanity that that that i think that's a big part of the solution just
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:13.200]  that mindset and idea that truly turns loose of the fear and then that empowers you and you
[3:55:13.200 --> 3:55:18.640]  were making a key point well see michael is is you know needs to come to understand that
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:22.800]  before you can help another person you must be strong in yourself and then from your model
[3:55:22.800 --> 3:55:27.360]  pretty much like alex what you are walking example of is by your model people have the
[3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:32.160]  egalitarian right then either do as you do or not to do if you do you know you can't force anything
[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:37.760]  down people's throats it's the example it's the standard it's the stack exactly and people who are
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:41.920]  sovereign within who've understood that they can find their center they can find their own inner
[3:55:41.920 --> 3:55:46.080]  truth and as i said that's not one size fits all it is not going to work on a social level
[3:55:46.080 --> 3:55:50.240]  where you know because again that's regimentation that's the fascist model is one size fits all
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:55.040]  for old people as we say as we do not as we act so the most important thing is to realize that
[3:55:55.040 --> 3:55:59.280]  yeah you got to go within yourself into the sanctity and the kingdom of your own being
[3:55:59.280 --> 3:56:03.920]  uh you know and find your own center and then from that place in a total state of fearlessness
[3:56:03.920 --> 3:56:10.720]  and passion take on the rival or the adversary you know and like i often say in my work when you
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:14.960]  are so strong i mean this is pretty much borrowed from martial arts when you are so inherently
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:19.760]  strong that your enemy cannot destroy you then your enemy is lost you can't go after them using
[3:56:19.760 --> 3:56:24.480]  the tools that they provided for you you can't enter into this duel with the with the with the
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:28.400]  swords and the guns that they have primed and offered you that has been tried in the past
[3:56:28.400 --> 3:56:34.160]  centuries and it hasn't worked we have not been overall overcome this tyrant this leviathan for
[3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:37.520]  the reasons that you mentioned because we've not been able to break the spell of their you know
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:42.000]  particular kind of sorcery that's absolutely right but so you were fighting you were bringing
[3:56:42.000 --> 3:56:45.120]  that before the break and when we're coming out and i want the followers to hear it about
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:49.920]  we owe it to our ancestors and the enslavement they went through finish that point well this
[3:56:49.920 --> 3:56:54.480]  is what my particular motive is is that even if a person is not humanitarian enough alex
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:58.720]  to do it for the rest of humanity that's all right do it at least for the dead within your
[3:56:58.720 --> 3:57:03.440]  own family the mothers the grandparents the grandfathers the ancestors who died on the
[3:57:03.440 --> 3:57:09.440]  fields who plowed who suffered who was murdered in wars wars of ritual wars of blood right these
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:14.160]  are your own ancestors for goodness sake people should be motivated to do it for your own lineage
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:17.920]  the people who cried into the night saying why is this happening to us why are we living in this
[3:57:17.920 --> 3:57:22.560]  a mud of abject poverty why are sons and daughters dying on the field of these parents yeah you know
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:27.440]  so we should be motivated just by that even if you don't care about the sorrow the glee the enemy
[3:57:27.440 --> 3:57:33.840]  had it ripping babies apart and enslaving and the nobles loving the people starving beneath them
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:40.080]  you know the the the raw enjoyment of depriving people i can't imagine that but that's the enemy
[3:57:40.080 --> 3:57:46.480]  soul they love greed they love hurting you they loved arm their control freaks and they can't
[3:57:46.480 --> 3:57:50.880]  wait to find another more innocent you know just like a 20 million inka that were killed in south
[3:57:50.880 --> 3:57:56.480]  america or the irish genocide or the south african genocides you see or the the opening of the
[3:57:56.480 --> 3:58:00.480]  british east india company and the terrible degradation they did in india they want to
[3:58:00.480 --> 3:58:05.120]  subjugate the entire world they're trying it now over there in iraq and iran you see they don't
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:10.000]  look at you as an iranian or as if you read their own works if people go to their own works and go
[3:58:10.000 --> 3:58:15.360]  to the works of these people like the albert pike they look at you as a cattle as an animal as an
[3:58:15.360 --> 3:58:22.080]  insect that is to be eradicated and their religion is viciously tearing you apart that's right i mean
[3:58:22.080 --> 3:58:26.320]  how many jugglers can you fit into one room it doesn't matter you see who juggles what ball is
[3:58:26.320 --> 3:58:32.080]  islamic judaic christian conservative labor that is all for the juggling act of the world it doesn't
[3:58:32.080 --> 3:58:36.160]  mean a thing to these people they just look at you as basically fodder that can be ritually
[3:58:36.160 --> 3:58:40.720]  murdered whenever the time or the particular astrological conjunctions take place when
[3:58:40.720 --> 3:58:45.840]  they need to sacrifice your ass to the to their cause on their own the ride michael sarin alters
