[00:00.000 --> 00:18.600]  It's the most wonderful time of the year With the kids jingle-belling and everyone telling
[00:18.600 --> 00:28.400]  you be a good cheer It's the most wonderful time of the year
[00:28.400 --> 00:35.400]  You know, when I talk about my shelf on air a lot, it's so I can relate to people, my
[00:35.400 --> 00:40.960]  thought process, it's the way I communicate, because I'm not like Obama in a speech, he'll
[00:40.960 --> 00:46.680]  say 300 times, I, I, I, me, me, me, me, me, talk about himself the third person.
[00:46.680 --> 00:53.320]  I'm doing it because I'm psychoanalyzing myself here on air.
[00:53.320 --> 00:59.760]  And I'm thinking to myself, why am I so incredibly upset?
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.800]  Why am I so angry at myself?
[01:01.800 --> 01:05.520]  Why am I so frustrated that I'm not doing enough?
[01:05.520 --> 01:16.160]  And it's because the amount of news and information totally proves what we're saying.
[01:16.160 --> 01:24.840]  And when I see one article, like the one I'm about to hit first, I pull up the data sheet
[01:24.840 --> 01:37.840]  of what I know and it's like finding 10 million dead children in your backyard buried.
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.760]  And they're coming for your kids, they're coming for mine.
[01:43.760 --> 01:49.160]  And it's the way they propagandize, the way they compartmentalize everything just in this
[01:49.160 --> 01:50.160]  one article.
[01:50.160 --> 01:53.400]  I mean, it brought up thousands of things when I was, was here.
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.800]  I hadn't seen this article yet, but I'd seen what happened in other parts of the world,
[01:58.800 --> 02:05.720]  the way the IMF, the way the World Bank handles it, the way the UN handles it.
[02:05.720 --> 02:10.520]  And I've got all the UN documents, they're in America destroyed by design.
[02:10.520 --> 02:17.920]  I just think, you know, if I just get up here and just cover this flippantly and cynically,
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.320]  people won't get how dangerous it is.
[02:19.320 --> 02:25.720]  And I get really, really angry at myself because if I don't just sarcastically hatefully say
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.880]  it, then I'm going to absorb it and I'm going to start crying.
[02:30.880 --> 02:34.720]  And then I'm going to start killing people.
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.200]  And that's why it's hard.
[02:37.200 --> 02:44.440]  And I know why people don't want to face all of this because it's hard, it's hard.
[02:44.440 --> 02:51.800]  They're putting polio in the vaccines.
[02:51.800 --> 02:57.600]  And when I warn people about this historic fact that it's ongoing in America now, they're
[02:57.600 --> 03:05.080]  testing us who they can get away with here now, they've done it all over.
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.240]  I know the pre-programming, oh, Jones is against vaccines.
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.520]  He doesn't believe in science.
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.360]  We're not talking about vaccines.
[03:12.360 --> 03:20.400]  We're talking about injecting black people in Alabama with syphilis for 48 years.
[03:20.400 --> 03:27.840]  We're talking about injecting appellations for 60 years with syphilis, poor white people.
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.600]  We're talking about thousands of confirmed UN events where they've been caught adding
[03:33.600 --> 03:39.160]  sterilence to the vaccines.
[03:39.160 --> 03:43.160]  And then we have the UN programs.
[03:43.160 --> 03:46.200]  And it makes me so angry because I know how the medical system works.
[03:46.200 --> 03:51.280]  My dad managed hospitals, dental clinics.
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.360]  My dad told me, don't sign your organ donor card.
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.720]  Hospitals in Dallas kill people and take their organs.
[03:56.720 --> 04:01.760]  I thought it was crazy and a decade later, 60 minutes named Dallas in Chicago caught
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.560]  red-handed killing people.
[04:07.560 --> 04:15.000]  And you have to understand, most of your real high-level assassins are medical doctors.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.880]  That's like the most elite killers they use are doctors because killers give life and
[04:19.880 --> 04:21.040]  they take life.
[04:21.040 --> 04:24.000]  Doctors give life and they take life.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.720]  So I could talk for the whole rest of the hour about ABC News, even admits it.
[04:28.720 --> 04:37.360]  This slips out because people don't even know what they're seeing.
[04:37.360 --> 04:39.360]  They're giving you polio.
[04:39.360 --> 04:45.600]  And when your child gets paralyzed, they admit that the hospitals are ordered not to report
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.240]  it as vaccine-induced contracted polio.
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.600]  My grandmother was given polio and the polio vaccine on purpose.
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.280]  She's dead now, we'll be right back.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.160]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[05:05.160 --> 05:06.720]  of many of our best-selling items.
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping
[05:10.000 --> 05:17.520]  store-wide, 50 to 75% off double-patria points, let's extend that sale but also add a free
[05:17.520 --> 05:19.480]  gift with every order.
[05:19.480 --> 05:23.720]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver iodine, 4 to 5 super blue, you'll get
[05:23.720 --> 05:28.280]  a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[05:28.280 --> 05:31.480]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[05:31.480 --> 05:32.480]  out.
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.440]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.440]  sells out.
[05:37.440 --> 05:39.760]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[05:39.760 --> 05:45.080]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[05:45.080 --> 05:46.600]  So this is a loss leader.
[05:46.600 --> 05:48.240]  We are losing money on this.
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.680]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[05:49.680 --> 05:51.640]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.920]  And don't fight the crowds.
[05:52.920 --> 05:53.920]  Get it.
[05:53.920 --> 05:54.920]  All right.
[05:54.920 --> 05:55.920]  Here it goes again.
[05:55.920 --> 05:59.280]  823-4
[05:59.280 --> 06:14.960]  732-3
[06:14.960 --> 06:16.960]  Do you want answers?
[06:16.960 --> 06:18.960]  Well, so does he.
[06:18.960 --> 06:20.960]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.960]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[06:22.960 --> 06:44.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:44.960 --> 06:59.960]  Google is evil.
[06:59.960 --> 07:04.960]  Before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate issue,
[07:04.960 --> 07:11.960]  which is the fantasy, dreamed up by some conservatives at Google another online platform 7 anti-conservative bias.
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.960]  What if Google was lying to you?
[07:13.960 --> 07:18.960]  There's repeatedly no credible evidence that supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[07:18.960 --> 07:23.960]  Here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[07:23.960 --> 07:27.960]  When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come to the top.
[07:27.960 --> 07:33.960]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to
[07:33.960 --> 07:38.960]  very stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website InfoWars.
[07:38.960 --> 07:42.960]  Does the United States need a national privacy law?
[07:42.960 --> 08:02.960]  The other issue I wanted to just raise in my last minute is moderating hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, and bullying policies.
[08:02.960 --> 08:07.960]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[08:07.960 --> 08:20.960]  This has come up in a number of different ways and we appreciate the work that you have done, particularly with YouTube.
[08:20.960 --> 08:25.960]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[08:25.960 --> 08:30.960]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[08:30.960 --> 08:37.960]  We're aware of his line in Congress. We're aware of him in the Dragonfly Project. It's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[08:37.960 --> 08:38.960]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[08:38.960 --> 08:42.960]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[08:42.960 --> 08:47.960]  Translation, Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[08:47.960 --> 08:50.960]  Google is evil. Google is evil.
[08:50.960 --> 08:53.960]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[08:53.960 --> 09:09.960]  They're all evil.
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, December 13th, 2018.
[09:14.960 --> 09:16.960]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[09:16.960 --> 09:21.960]  Gavin McInnes is going to be in studio with us for the second and third hour today.
[09:21.960 --> 09:24.960]  He's one of the most banned people out there in the world.
[09:24.960 --> 09:28.960]  He's in his band or the hated as I am, but he's getting close.
[09:28.960 --> 09:30.960]  Let's show him to that brass ring.
[09:30.960 --> 09:32.960]  That means you're over the target.
[09:32.960 --> 09:34.960]  Great guy. I got a chance to hang out with him last night.
[09:34.960 --> 09:39.960]  We're going to have him in studio for several hours. Appreciate him coming to Austin.
[09:39.960 --> 09:42.960]  He just got kicked off CRTV.
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.960]  The old Becky Poo one day after Beck merged with it and basically got control of it.
[09:47.960 --> 09:51.960]  But I'm sure Glenn Beck had nothing to do with that.
[09:51.960 --> 09:53.960]  I just know behind the scenes.
[09:53.960 --> 09:57.960]  He tried to kick me off all these radio stations and ruined my operation in this.
[09:57.960 --> 10:04.960]  Work tirelessly to stop any competition he sees to himself being number one.
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.960]  So that's all coming up with Gavin McInnes.
[10:09.960 --> 10:12.960]  He's not going to be getting any Glenn Beck or any of that.
[10:12.960 --> 10:18.960]  Okay. I kind of got, I don't want to say sidetracked onto Google and AI or state.
[10:18.960 --> 10:20.960]  It's really, really central and very, very important, obviously.
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.960]  But I do want to hit some of the other cultural issues and things.
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.960]  And then just sit back and ask people, do they want to put up with this?
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.960]  And I most importantly want to talk to the folks that are driving down the road for the first time
[10:35.960 --> 10:41.960]  and tuning through AM or FM radio or flipping through the TV channels and they go, who's this?
[10:41.960 --> 10:43.960]  And then you see the name Alex Jones for the first time.
[10:43.960 --> 10:46.960]  You go, oh, I heard he's the bad guy.
[10:46.960 --> 10:52.960]  And then you have the mental image of what thousands of newspapers and TV stations have said about me.
[10:52.960 --> 10:55.960]  That's not true. Why would they do that?
[10:55.960 --> 10:59.960]  Why would they spend so much time and energy trying to shut me down and destroy me?
[10:59.960 --> 11:02.960]  Because I've got their number.
[11:02.960 --> 11:05.960]  And I also know how to defeat the globalists.
[11:05.960 --> 11:08.960]  You see, we're compartmentalized.
[11:08.960 --> 11:25.960]  And less than one tenth of one percent, less than one tenth of one percent of the people in the world
[11:25.960 --> 11:30.960]  are working for the globalists consciously carrying out these evil operations.
[11:30.960 --> 11:38.960]  Different ideologies are prepared and rolled out by the globalist to set up the building blocks
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.960]  of what they then move into new projects and construct and it's done in phases.
[11:43.960 --> 11:52.960]  And it is a totally sci-fi, diabolic, hundred and seventy year plan we've been living under.
[11:52.960 --> 12:01.960]  It is, incidentally, a 200 year plan that's supposed to be done in 30 years.
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.960]  And I used to think they were behind. They're really right on schedule.
[12:06.960 --> 12:10.960]  But the awakening is bigger than they thought it would be. They knew it was coming.
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.960]  They've been preparing for it. But you need to understand something.
[12:15.960 --> 12:23.960]  It is an absolute fact that the cell phones are designed to track, trace, control you and also radiate you and kill you.
[12:23.960 --> 12:32.960]  It is a fact that nanotech is added to all the major vaccines and that everyone is having introduced into them
[12:32.960 --> 12:39.960]  binary weapon systems that can be activated to kill you at the time of the establishment's choosing
[12:39.960 --> 12:46.960]  either chemically or magnetically or harmonially triggered weapon systems.
[12:46.960 --> 12:57.960]  It is a fact that the globalists are setting up an atmosphere and a system for a class of civilizations,
[12:57.960 --> 13:07.960]  a giant religious world war and an artificial Armageddon to reduce population and bring in an AI run world government.
[13:07.960 --> 13:14.960]  That's their admitted point. And we're entering the final phases of beta testing.
[13:14.960 --> 13:21.960]  And you're going to have one in three children unable to speak within 15 years.
[13:21.960 --> 13:28.960]  You're going to have about half the population with cancer by 2027.
[13:28.960 --> 13:31.960]  That's only eight, nine years away.
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.960]  You are going to watch your children die, watch your wife, your husband, everyone.
[13:37.960 --> 13:41.960]  And it's all going to be hyped up of what's doing in and they're going to ease you into it.
[13:41.960 --> 13:44.960]  Oh, we've got to find what's doing or find the cure.
[13:44.960 --> 13:48.960]  And there'll be lots of races and runs and America and the world will gut up.
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.960]  And we don't know why we're all dying when it's all being done on purpose.
[13:53.960 --> 13:55.960]  You and your family are being murdered.
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.960]  And if you're driving down the road for the first time hearing this, you have to understand something.
[14:00.960 --> 14:02.960]  All of this is completely admitted.
[14:02.960 --> 14:05.960]  And if I tried to give you all the evidence, it would take 5,000 years.
[14:05.960 --> 14:09.960]  But let's just use a few that everybody's heard of.
[14:09.960 --> 14:13.960]  Remember how Hillary, when she was Secretary of State, apologized.
[14:13.960 --> 14:15.960]  It's always a sick joke.
[14:15.960 --> 14:23.960]  For the U.S. government giving people in Africa, Latin America, and the Appalachians and the rural South,
[14:23.960 --> 14:25.960]  syphilis in the Tuskegee operation.
[14:25.960 --> 14:27.960]  That was only one name.
[14:27.960 --> 14:29.960]  It wasn't Operation Tuskegee, but it's called Tuskegee popularly.
[14:29.960 --> 14:33.960]  That was just one little thing of it going on at the university there in Tuskegee.
[14:33.960 --> 14:37.960]  Now, see, the reason that's important is it is completely confirmed.
[14:37.960 --> 14:40.960]  I have an ABC News report right here, but it's local Chicago.
[14:40.960 --> 14:43.960]  This wouldn't go out national because they didn't know what they were reporting on.
[14:43.960 --> 14:47.960]  And they say, you know, we've talked to the hospitals and yeah, they're not reporting.
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.960]  People are dying and being paralyzed from polio.
[14:51.960 --> 14:54.960]  A virus that eats your nerves.
[14:54.960 --> 14:59.960]  Now, again, whole other subject. My grandmother, who died last year at 90-92,
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.960]  she got the first round of flu vaccine and it was spreading the faster the vaccine came out.
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.960]  And then she got the second round for a new mutation and got it a week later.
[15:09.960 --> 15:16.960]  And the doctor told her while she was there in the hospital room with the iron lung,
[15:16.960 --> 15:26.960]  told her, yes, Benny Grace, Hammond, you got it. You have the strain from the vaccine.
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.960]  We haven't perfected it yet. We're sorry. We're sorry.
[15:32.960 --> 15:39.960]  So this is my life. I'm going to just read this, but tens of thousands of children are dying right now across America
[15:39.960 --> 15:48.960]  after they get the shot for polio and the government's ordering it covered up.
[15:48.960 --> 15:54.960]  Do you understand? This is a planned program to test and explain how they run it when we come back.
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.960]  They're coming to kill your children.
[15:58.960 --> 16:05.960]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:05.960 --> 16:09.960]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[16:35.960 --> 16:40.960]  Someone has finally come up with a better way. The Bug Assault, a miniaturized shotgun,
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.960]  which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.960]  Non-toxic and no batteries required. So much fun. You'll forget you have a wife and kids.

[17:20.960 --> 17:28.960]  The Deep State began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[17:51.960 --> 18:07.960]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[18:07.960 --> 18:11.960]  where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[20:22.960 --> 20:27.960]  You know, I don't want to get into anything personal with the crew here in Austin,
[20:27.960 --> 20:37.960]  but I know two people in this building whose children died after they were given a vaccine.
[20:37.960 --> 20:45.960]  My grandmother almost died from the polio vaccine. They told her it gave her polio.
[20:45.960 --> 20:56.960]  I was visiting the biggest owner of pediatrician facilities 10 years ago for a visit, a well-checked for my first daughter.
[20:56.960 --> 21:05.960]  And the owner of the clinics he's since retired, one of the few big clinic chains that doesn't push vaccines on you,
[21:05.960 --> 21:10.960]  said, I hear you're opting out, and the nurse goes out and he goes, damn right.
[21:10.960 --> 21:17.960]  You know, we have these city clinics where you're supposed to, you know, doctors volunteer at the start of the school year,
[21:17.960 --> 21:25.960]  and you go out and you go to these gymnasiums and places and we vaccinate thousands of children.
[21:25.960 --> 21:39.960]  He goes, I refuse to do it now because we were giving him a live polio vaccine from the 1960s that's been banned since the 70s by the law.
[21:39.960 --> 21:43.960]  And I go, I know, doctor, because it's got live SV40 cancer virus.
[21:43.960 --> 21:45.960]  He goes, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[21:45.960 --> 21:48.960]  You know, this is big, tough businessman guy.
[21:48.960 --> 21:49.960]  I'm just leaving it at that.
[21:49.960 --> 21:51.960]  People listen to me, probably don't know what I'm talking about.
[21:51.960 --> 21:53.960]  And all of a sudden he grabs me by the arm.
[21:53.960 --> 21:55.960]  He goes, don't you say my name.
[21:55.960 --> 21:57.960]  And so he was having a moment of conscience.
[21:57.960 --> 21:59.960]  That's what I want to explain to you.
[21:59.960 --> 22:04.960]  My dad knew enough in the Dallas scene, because he wasn't just a dentist or oral surgeon.
[22:04.960 --> 22:10.960]  He did medical management, he leased and sold systems to hospitals.
[22:10.960 --> 22:20.960]  He owned a hospital for a while in Rowlett, a Mesquite.
[22:20.960 --> 22:30.960]  And it was well known that there were doctors, surgeons that if somebody could be alive, not even hurt bad, they'd kill you ass and get your organs.
[22:30.960 --> 22:33.960]  Now, let me explain something.
[22:33.960 --> 22:35.960]  This is later came out on 60 minutes.
[22:35.960 --> 22:42.960]  What I'm trying to tell you is, ladies and gentlemen, in Africa, in Asia, all over, it's on the local news.
[22:42.960 --> 22:46.960]  The UN came and they all gave us vaccines.
[22:46.960 --> 22:51.960]  And all the babies and the pregnant women stopped moving a day later and they had miscarriages.
[22:51.960 --> 22:54.960]  And many of the children became paralyzed and died.
[22:54.960 --> 22:57.960]  And here is my daughter and then the daughter is totally paralyzed.
[22:57.960 --> 22:59.960]  She lives, but it's worse than death.
[22:59.960 --> 23:04.960]  This has been, I've been seeing this and reading this for decades.
[23:04.960 --> 23:11.960]  You know, the Africans and people, they used to love it when the white man doctor showed up.
[23:11.960 --> 23:13.960]  And they think, oh, big, big medicine.
[23:13.960 --> 23:21.960]  But now all over the world, from Thailand to Burma to Nigeria, the people run.
[23:21.960 --> 23:25.960]  And they now bring in UN troops and make you take your shots.
[23:25.960 --> 23:27.960]  And then the UN gets caught doing it.
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.960]  So what they're doing is beta testing.
[23:31.960 --> 23:38.960]  How many people can we give tainted vaccine and give them polio?
[23:38.960 --> 23:42.960]  And how many people can we give tetanus shot that actually has a hormone added to it?
[23:42.960 --> 23:47.960]  So the body has an autoimmune response to the hormone and then it causes sterilization in second trimester.
[23:47.960 --> 23:49.960]  It's not classic sterilization.
[23:49.960 --> 23:57.960]  It's a programmed autoimmune response where the baby is attacked in the second trimester when the hormones release.
[23:57.960 --> 24:03.960]  So it's actually a very violent, painful autoimmune disease given to women to kill their babies.
[24:03.960 --> 24:09.960]  Very vicious soft kill weapon, which is designed to debilitate the people as well.
[24:09.960 --> 24:25.960]  Again, the 223 round developed in Vietnam to get around the Geneva Convention is actually designed to maim not to kill to cause maximum weight on the enemy operation.
[24:25.960 --> 24:27.960]  These are silent weapons for quiet wars.
[24:27.960 --> 24:29.960]  These are soft kill weapons.
[24:29.960 --> 24:38.960]  So explain, we have a globalist breakaway civilization that is, you know, classically, and it's declassified.
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.960]  It just becomes a rumor like, oh, I heard Alex Jones say the smartphones track you 20 years ago, and it's all true.
[24:44.960 --> 24:53.960]  Or Jones said 17 years ago that the cell phones and the computers are listening to you with keywords and recording it all for data and for advertising.
[24:53.960 --> 24:54.960]  Now it's all admitted.
[24:54.960 --> 24:55.960]  It wasn't rumors.
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.960]  I was reading to you from the leaked documents from the whistleblowers.
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.960]  That's the same thing.
[25:02.960 --> 25:06.960]  They come out and they give children and adults.
[25:06.960 --> 25:10.960]  Before my dad quit practicing dentistry, he still did it like three days a week.
[25:10.960 --> 25:13.960]  Maybe to all the old patients he'd had for decades that loved him.
[25:13.960 --> 25:16.960]  They'd come in and they'd be on the edge of death.
[25:16.960 --> 25:29.960]  He saw one time he said more than 10 patients in a week who had shingles, which is just herpes and all over the body.
[25:29.960 --> 25:32.960]  But they give it another name.
[25:32.960 --> 25:36.960]  And they'd say, oh, Dr. Jones.
[25:36.960 --> 25:39.960]  Oh, black ladies, old white ladies, you name it, some wealthy, some not.
[25:39.960 --> 25:41.960]  See, that was some of the stories.
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.960]  He said it was all demographics.
[25:42.960 --> 25:44.960]  And they'd just be like, I was doing great.
[25:44.960 --> 25:48.960]  And I went into Walgreens and got my single shot.
[25:48.960 --> 25:50.960]  And I don't know why I got it a week later.
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.960]  They may have to amputate my leg.
[25:53.960 --> 25:56.960]  And then they did amputate her leg.
[25:56.960 --> 26:04.960]  And while I'm just watching people walk into machine gun fire, and every day,
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.960]  man paralyzed after flu shot, baby dies after flu shot.
[26:11.960 --> 26:15.960]  Most every time I'm on vacation, there'll be families out at the pool.
[26:15.960 --> 26:19.960]  They'll have two or three kids and they've always got a little boy who's autistic and going,
[26:19.960 --> 26:23.960]  you feel very sad for them, but they're howling at the moon, whatever.
[26:23.960 --> 26:26.960]  And I always said, oh, what's wrong with your son?
[26:26.960 --> 26:27.960]  Poor thing.
[26:27.960 --> 26:29.960]  Oh, he's got autism.
[26:29.960 --> 26:30.960]  And I go, when did it happen?
[26:30.960 --> 26:33.960]  Well, at 18 months, we think it was the vaccine.
[26:33.960 --> 26:36.960]  We were driving home after he got the shot at the school.
[26:36.960 --> 26:37.960]  And he started convulsing.
[26:37.960 --> 26:39.960]  And he was asleep for a day.
[26:39.960 --> 26:40.960]  And we took him to the doctor.
[26:40.960 --> 26:41.960]  And they just said, just a bad reaction.
[26:41.960 --> 26:42.960]  He'll be fine.
[26:42.960 --> 26:45.960]  And he was 18 months old running and talking and walking.
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.960]  And he didn't walk for about a year after that.
[26:49.960 --> 26:50.960]  But he's four now.
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.960]  And, you know, we think he might be able to live on his own someday if we work hard enough with it.
[26:56.960 --> 27:01.960]  It's just everywhere, everywhere.
[27:01.960 --> 27:05.960]  My dad's brother, never in the hospital, never sick.
[27:05.960 --> 27:11.960]  Had the scouts out there, wanting him in high school to skip college and go right to pro baseball.
[27:11.960 --> 27:12.960]  Took a tetanus shot.
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.960]  Had to go to the hospital for a week, almost killed him.
[27:16.960 --> 27:22.960]  And he was always a little retarded after that.
[27:22.960 --> 27:25.960]  My whole family's just been devastated.
[27:25.960 --> 27:26.960]  Me personally.
[27:26.960 --> 27:28.960]  And I could walk right out that room and talk to him.
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.960]  Briggs Wayne and his child died when they were given a vaccine by the U.S. military,
[27:33.960 --> 27:39.960]  because they were in the military at the time while they were on deployment.
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.960]  They'll take your child and they'll run them full of this poison and they'll kill them.
[27:45.960 --> 27:46.960]  That's if they're lucky.
[27:46.960 --> 27:49.960]  It's going to be in brain damage for the rest of their life.
[27:49.960 --> 27:55.960]  25, 30-year-old men drinking out of bottles, wearing diapers.
[27:55.960 --> 27:57.960]  A chemical warfare lobotomy.
[27:57.960 --> 27:59.960]  And that's the old-fashioned tech.
[27:59.960 --> 28:05.960]  They got nanotech now in the vaccines.
[28:05.960 --> 28:12.960]  And they have this weird metaphysics rule that they have to get you to consent and bring your child to do it.
[28:12.960 --> 28:15.960]  And the doctors all know it. The nurses all know it.
[28:15.960 --> 28:16.960]  That's why they want to fire the nurses.
[28:16.960 --> 28:18.960]  Most of the nurses won't take it.
[28:18.960 --> 28:19.960]  You know, we've had nurse whistleblowers on.
[28:19.960 --> 28:21.960]  It's been in the news, too.
[28:21.960 --> 28:23.960]  We're in the preemie wards.
[28:23.960 --> 28:26.960]  The bioethics board above the doctors tells them to give them shots.
[28:26.960 --> 28:27.960]  They didn't use to.
[28:27.960 --> 28:29.960]  You didn't give them a premium shot.
[28:29.960 --> 28:30.960]  And they go in.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.960]  They put them on respirators as they give them a shot because a lot of them die on the spot.
[28:34.960 --> 28:37.960]  And under the eugenics rule, it's a lethal injection.
[28:37.960 --> 28:38.960]  That's what it really is.
[28:38.960 --> 28:43.960]  And let's expand. The Clintons for over a decade knowingly shipped HIV and hepatitis blood out of the prison
[28:43.960 --> 28:46.960]  certifying it's healthy to be given to people all over America and the world.
[28:46.960 --> 28:50.960]  They estimate more than 5 million people contracted HIV and hepatitis.
[28:50.960 --> 28:53.960]  And most of them have now died, 3 million plus dead.
[28:53.960 --> 28:55.960]  The Clintons did it on purpose.
[28:55.960 --> 28:57.960]  They love murdering people.
[28:59.960 --> 29:02.960]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.960]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[29:07.960 --> 29:10.960]  The bug assault. A miniaturized shotgun.
[29:10.960 --> 29:14.960]  Which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[29:14.960 --> 29:16.960]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.

[29:40.960 --> 29:42.960]  respiratory infections are targeted directly,
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.960]  where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.

[29:51.960 --> 29:55.960]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[29:55.960 --> 29:57.960]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.960]  Everybody knows that history documents it,
[30:02.960 --> 30:06.960]  but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history
[30:06.960 --> 30:08.960]  that wants to hurt children.
[30:08.960 --> 30:09.960]  They want to abort children.
[30:09.960 --> 30:11.960]  They want to disease children.
[30:11.960 --> 30:12.960]  They want to abuse children.
[30:12.960 --> 30:13.960]  They want to confuse children.
[30:13.960 --> 30:15.960]  They want their essence.
[30:15.960 --> 30:16.960]  They want their soul.
[30:16.960 --> 30:17.960]  They want their spirit.
[30:17.960 --> 30:19.960]  They want their power.
[30:19.960 --> 30:21.960]  Because they are our future.
[30:21.960 --> 30:23.960]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ,
[30:23.960 --> 30:25.960]  not also about sacrifice.
[30:25.960 --> 30:26.960]  It is about the West.
[30:26.960 --> 30:29.960]  It is about a human future and standing with each other
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.960]  and believing in a better future.
[30:31.960 --> 30:33.960]  I just want to thank you all for your support,
[30:33.960 --> 30:36.960]  but I want to ask you all to pray for your own family,
[30:36.960 --> 30:38.960]  to pray for America, to pray for President Trump,
[30:38.960 --> 30:40.960]  and to pray for Info Wars,
[30:40.960 --> 30:44.960]  and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[30:44.960 --> 30:46.960]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[30:46.960 --> 30:50.960]  You have the power to stop the globalist dead in their tracks.
[30:50.960 --> 30:51.960]  I know you've been taking action.
[30:51.960 --> 30:54.960]  I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble,
[30:54.960 --> 30:59.960]  but just remember you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[30:59.960 --> 31:04.960]  Info Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government,
[31:04.960 --> 31:08.960]  the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[31:08.960 --> 31:10.960]  We've been proven dead on.
[31:10.960 --> 31:13.960]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[31:13.960 --> 31:17.960]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you
[31:17.960 --> 31:18.960]  and salute you.
[31:18.960 --> 31:20.960]  All words are not enough.
[31:20.960 --> 31:22.960]  Think about, of all the different systems,
[31:22.960 --> 31:26.960]  of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target,
[31:26.960 --> 31:30.960]  promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalist
[31:30.960 --> 31:32.960]  and the dominant world force.
[31:32.960 --> 31:36.960]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other,
[31:36.960 --> 31:38.960]  but we have cut right to the chase.
[31:38.960 --> 31:42.960]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[31:42.960 --> 31:45.960]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever
[31:45.960 --> 31:48.960]  to remember that Info Wars really is your baby.
[31:48.960 --> 31:51.960]  I am in your hands, and we're under unprecedented attack,
[31:51.960 --> 31:53.960]  and we just need you to go to infowarsport.com
[31:53.960 --> 31:56.960]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever

[32:37.960 --> 32:41.960]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[32:41.960 --> 32:43.960]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula
[32:43.960 --> 32:46.960]  that contains unmodified high quality Crill Oil concentrate.
[32:46.960 --> 32:49.960]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately,
[32:49.960 --> 32:53.960]  it's time to see what Crill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil,
[32:53.960 --> 33:20.960]  now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[33:24.960 --> 33:28.960]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs,
[33:28.960 --> 33:33.960]  which by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[33:33.960 --> 33:50.960]  I hope she would better start from the beginning.
[33:50.960 --> 33:53.960]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[33:53.960 --> 33:55.960]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.960]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[34:00.960 --> 34:03.960]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[34:03.960 --> 34:06.960]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[34:06.960 --> 34:09.960]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[34:09.960 --> 34:11.960]  that the preservatives may actually be associated
[34:11.960 --> 34:13.960]  with improved behavior and mental performance.
[34:13.960 --> 34:16.960]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.960]  but could it also cause cancer?
[34:18.960 --> 34:21.960]  Turns out the government had the right under U.S. law
[34:21.960 --> 34:24.960]  to conduct secret testing on the American public
[34:24.960 --> 34:25.960]  under a specific condition.
[34:25.960 --> 34:27.960]  We have to work with dark side,
[34:27.960 --> 34:29.960]  otherwise we'll spend time in the shadows.
[34:29.960 --> 34:32.960]  Any attempt to achieve world order
[34:32.960 --> 34:34.960]  must be the work of the devil.
[34:34.960 --> 34:35.960]  Well, join me.
[34:35.960 --> 34:37.960]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[34:37.960 --> 34:40.960]  There's a need for a new world order.
[34:40.960 --> 34:45.960]  Someday, in the next few years,
[34:45.960 --> 34:48.960]  a solution will emerge.
[35:08.960 --> 35:10.960]  Why was Gavin McGinnis banned
[35:10.960 --> 35:12.960]  off of almost every platform?
[35:12.960 --> 35:15.960]  You know why?
[35:15.960 --> 35:18.960]  You know why?
[35:18.960 --> 35:21.960]  Because he dared to create an organization
[35:21.960 --> 35:22.960]  that was proud of America,
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.960]  that was inclusive of Christians,
[35:27.960 --> 35:30.960]  of Jews, of straight, of gay,
[35:30.960 --> 35:33.960]  men who aren't ashamed of being men,
[35:33.960 --> 35:35.960]  aren't ashamed of America,
[35:35.960 --> 35:37.960]  and who go out peacefully, 10 to 1,
[35:37.960 --> 35:40.960]  when Antifa tries to hit men, women, and children
[35:40.960 --> 35:43.960]  with metal clubs, bike locks, you name it.
[35:43.960 --> 35:45.960]  When they are attacked,
[35:45.960 --> 35:47.960]  they would kick their ass in self-defense.
[35:47.960 --> 35:51.960]  And that good John Wayne image, for real,
[35:51.960 --> 35:53.960]  is why it has to be a platform,
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.960]  because the paramilitary arm
[35:57.960 --> 36:00.960]  of the system, of the globalist, of the left,
[36:00.960 --> 36:02.960]  I mean, we posted video yesterday
[36:02.960 --> 36:06.960]  to Infowars.com, exclusively,
[36:06.960 --> 36:08.960]  of Antifa hitting people with clubs,
[36:08.960 --> 36:10.960]  throwing eggs at them, attacking them,
[36:10.960 --> 36:12.960]  who came to protest the mayor.
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.960]  And the police stand down in Portland
[36:16.960 --> 36:18.960]  and let Antifa, who are mainly professors,
[36:18.960 --> 36:20.960]  and city employees in mask,
[36:20.960 --> 36:24.960]  government employees in mask, beat you.
[36:24.960 --> 36:27.960]  Just like Hitler's brown shirts.
[36:27.960 --> 36:30.960]  And so you can't let American men
[36:30.960 --> 36:33.960]  organize to go out and peacefully stand
[36:33.960 --> 36:36.960]  with those that want to protest
[36:36.960 --> 36:38.960]  and enjoy the First Amendment
[36:38.960 --> 36:40.960]  when the police work for the system.
[36:40.960 --> 36:42.960]  You know, under the Strong Cities Initiative,
[36:42.960 --> 36:44.960]  the federal government under Obama
[36:44.960 --> 36:46.960]  tried to make all police departments
[36:46.960 --> 36:48.960]  capitulate and go under UN monitors,
[36:48.960 --> 36:50.960]  not just the Justice Department,
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.960]  UN monitors.
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.960]  The video is posted on Infowars.com.
[36:59.960 --> 37:02.960]  Shock video, Antifa terrorizes local
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.960]  residents protesting mayor.
[37:07.960 --> 37:10.960]  So, he'll be in studio with us,
[37:10.960 --> 37:13.960]  but let me just go back to where I was.
[37:13.960 --> 37:16.960]  Every time they go out and vaccinate people,
[37:16.960 --> 37:19.960]  they say, well, viruses like polio
[37:19.960 --> 37:21.960]  are giving people polio.
[37:21.960 --> 37:23.960]  And there's no known vaccine
[37:23.960 --> 37:26.960]  for what this is doing.
[37:26.960 --> 37:28.960]  But we know from all over the world,
[37:28.960 --> 37:30.960]  and major medical groups that have gone and done studies,
[37:30.960 --> 37:32.960]  that it is the UN vaccines
[37:32.960 --> 37:34.960]  and Bella Melinda Gates Foundation
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.960]  that are financing this.
[37:39.960 --> 37:42.960]  There's an article out today about smart tattoos
[37:42.960 --> 37:46.960]  will actually be microchips in the future.
[37:46.960 --> 37:49.960]  And they're already here that tell you basic things.
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.960]  And they just implant colored microbeads
[37:54.960 --> 37:55.960]  that are digital,
[37:55.960 --> 37:58.960]  that then have information implanted on them,
[37:58.960 --> 38:00.960]  and it's literally the mark of the beast,
[38:00.960 --> 38:03.960]  a hologram digital number
[38:03.960 --> 38:08.960]  in the forehead of the hand to buy and sell.
[38:08.960 --> 38:09.960]  And guess what?
[38:09.960 --> 38:11.960]  Many of them are going to be flesh colored.
[38:11.960 --> 38:13.960]  So, it's simply in your skin,
[38:13.960 --> 38:15.960]  the chips are in your skin,
[38:15.960 --> 38:18.960]  revelation to the exact T
[38:18.960 --> 38:21.960]  2,000 years later.
[38:21.960 --> 38:23.960]  And whether you believe the Bible is true or not,
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.960]  the globalists are manifesting it.
[38:29.960 --> 38:33.960]  So, that's where we are.
[38:33.960 --> 38:38.960]  And that's where this planet is going.
[38:38.960 --> 38:41.960]  And that's where things have been directed.
[38:41.960 --> 38:42.960]  A lot of people say,
[38:42.960 --> 38:45.960]  this is really, really, really scary.
[38:45.960 --> 38:47.960]  Why are you trying to scare us into moralizers?
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.960]  No, I believe you're fighters.
[38:49.960 --> 38:50.960]  I believe you're smart.
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.960]  And I know that they want to get all this institutionalized
[38:55.960 --> 38:56.960]  and just standard, like,
[38:56.960 --> 38:58.960]  oh, we're not tracking you with your phone.
[38:58.960 --> 39:00.960]  Then they admit they were 20 years ago.
[39:00.960 --> 39:02.960]  Oh, we're not listening to you in your house.
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.960]  Now they admit they are.
[39:03.960 --> 39:05.960]  Oh, there's nothing in the vaccines,
[39:05.960 --> 39:06.960]  and then they admit they're doing it.
[39:06.960 --> 39:08.960]  They have a history of secret testing,
[39:08.960 --> 39:09.960]  killing people, you name it.
[39:09.960 --> 39:11.960]  And it's not even your average doctor,
[39:11.960 --> 39:14.960]  even though almost none of them take vaccines.
[39:14.960 --> 39:17.960]  I know a lot of medical doctors in town.
[39:17.960 --> 39:20.960]  Every one of them is a fan.
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.960]  Every one of them.
[39:22.960 --> 39:25.960]  We had our, well, with my new wife,
[39:25.960 --> 39:27.960]  a baby a year and a half ago,
[39:27.960 --> 39:29.960]  a wonderful, healthy little sweet angel.
[39:29.960 --> 39:30.960]  Thank God.
[39:30.960 --> 39:36.960]  And I have three daughters and one son.
[39:36.960 --> 39:40.960]  And the doctor we had before was retired.
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.960]  And so we just looked at who was highly rated and good.
[39:43.960 --> 39:46.960]  Sure enough, total listener, nurse total listener,
[39:46.960 --> 39:49.960]  total listeners.
[39:49.960 --> 39:52.960]  Medical doctor lives in my neighborhood, total listener.
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.960]  Another medical doctor that I see never even knew he was a listener.
[39:56.960 --> 39:58.960]  And he goes, man, I've been listening to everything for years, blah, blah, blah.
[39:58.960 --> 40:00.960]  He goes, of course you're out about the vaccines.
[40:00.960 --> 40:02.960]  Of course they're putting all the stuff in them.
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.960]  You know, look into this such and such and such study.
[40:04.960 --> 40:05.960]  They've been doing at least 30 years.
[40:05.960 --> 40:07.960]  I mean, they all know, okay?
[40:07.960 --> 40:10.960]  Like my dad's saying, son,
[40:10.960 --> 40:12.960]  I'm going to come home from work early today.
[40:12.960 --> 40:14.960]  I'm going to take you up there to do your driving test.
[40:14.960 --> 40:18.960]  Do not sign the organ donor card.
[40:18.960 --> 40:22.960]  Do not opt in.
[40:22.960 --> 40:24.960]  And I said, why?
[40:24.960 --> 40:27.960]  And he said, one of these hospitals in Dallas will kill you.
[40:27.960 --> 40:30.960]  If you're in a car wreck or something and aren't even close to brain dad,
[40:30.960 --> 40:33.960]  especially if you're young and healthy.
[40:33.960 --> 40:36.960]  And he said back then, you know, your organs worth about $300,000.
[40:36.960 --> 40:38.960]  It'll be about a million today.
[40:38.960 --> 40:40.960]  Today's numbers.
[40:40.960 --> 40:48.960]  Now that was 30 years ago.
[40:48.960 --> 40:51.960]  And I remember rolling my eyes and saying, oh, come on, dad.
[40:51.960 --> 40:53.960]  You know, I knew how smart my dad was.
[40:53.960 --> 40:56.960]  And then years later, I'm sitting there watching 60 minutes
[40:56.960 --> 41:00.960]  of my grandparents in Austin.
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.960]  And there was the whole show about Dallas and Chicago
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.960]  killing people for their organs.
[41:09.960 --> 41:12.960]  Austin does it too.
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.960]  And they try to spend it all before they're dead.
[41:15.960 --> 41:18.960]  They keep you alive while they're taking them out.
[41:18.960 --> 41:21.960]  We're talking about people that don't even have brain damage.
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.960]  They'll put your ass under and kill you.
[41:25.960 --> 41:28.960]  Now, who ran the Nazi hierarchy?
[41:28.960 --> 41:31.960]  Who decided who to kill and who to keep alive?
[41:31.960 --> 41:33.960]  It was doctors.
[41:33.960 --> 41:34.960]  They wrote up the plans.
[41:34.960 --> 41:35.960]  They worked with IBM.
[41:35.960 --> 41:36.960]  It was all medical.
[41:36.960 --> 41:39.960]  It was bioethics.
[41:39.960 --> 41:44.960]  But see, this global system targets everybody except the establishment.
[41:44.960 --> 41:46.960]  And they could be Indian.
[41:46.960 --> 41:47.960]  They could be Chinese.
[41:47.960 --> 41:48.960]  They could be Jewish.
[41:48.960 --> 41:51.960]  They could be white Anglo-Saxon.
[41:51.960 --> 41:54.960]  You just got to be in the inner club and then you eat organic food.
[41:54.960 --> 41:55.960]  You drink purified water.
[41:55.960 --> 41:56.960]  They get clean vaccines.
[41:56.960 --> 41:58.960]  They actually do work.
[41:58.960 --> 42:00.960]  But you don't get them.
[42:00.960 --> 42:02.960]  So just remember that, ladies and gentlemen, with the peer pressure.
[42:02.960 --> 42:04.960]  And they do all this.
[42:04.960 --> 42:07.960]  They try to make it mandatory to do all this.
[42:07.960 --> 42:10.960]  Try to take the age of consent away for sex in California,
[42:10.960 --> 42:12.960]  but also saying they've done it.
[42:12.960 --> 42:13.960]  You know, 10-year-olds can say,
[42:13.960 --> 42:17.960]  no, mommy, I'm getting a $200 free debit card when I get my vaccines.
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.960]  So your children can countermand the parents in California.
[42:23.960 --> 42:24.960]  And now that's going nationwide.
[42:24.960 --> 42:27.960]  Let me just plug real quick.
[42:27.960 --> 42:29.960]  Without you funding us, we won't be here.
[42:29.960 --> 42:31.960]  Plus, we make it really easy to support us.
[42:31.960 --> 42:33.960]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[42:33.960 --> 42:35.960]  50 to 75% off.
[42:35.960 --> 42:36.960]  Everything store-wide.
[42:36.960 --> 42:39.960]  Double patriot points and a free t-shirt.
[42:39.960 --> 42:41.960]  You pick the size, but it's a mystery t-shirt,
[42:41.960 --> 42:44.960]  because we're selling out everything with every order.
[42:44.960 --> 42:45.960]  This is the biggest deal ever.
[42:45.960 --> 42:46.960]  Super clearance sale.
[42:46.960 --> 42:47.960]  Thank you for your support.
[42:47.960 --> 42:49.960]  If you've never been a supporter,
[42:49.960 --> 42:51.960]  you've never tried the products, you really should.
[42:51.960 --> 42:52.960]  This is the best way to try them.
[42:52.960 --> 42:54.960]  Infowarsstore.com.
[42:54.960 --> 42:55.960]  60% off.
[42:55.960 --> 42:57.960]  All super blue.
[42:57.960 --> 42:59.960]  In the last few months,
[42:59.960 --> 43:01.960]  Infowars has been escalating our sales
[43:01.960 --> 43:04.960]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[43:04.960 --> 43:06.960]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[43:06.960 --> 43:08.960]  Let's not just extend the sale free shipping store-wide.
[43:08.960 --> 43:10.960]  50 to 75% off.
[43:10.960 --> 43:11.960]  Double patriot points.
[43:11.960 --> 43:13.960]  Let's extend that sale,
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.960]  but also add a free gift with every order.
[43:17.960 --> 43:19.960]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free,
[43:19.960 --> 43:21.960]  colloidal silver, iodine, fortified super blue,
[43:21.960 --> 43:25.960]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt
[43:25.960 --> 43:26.960]  while supplies last.
[43:26.960 --> 43:27.960]  And what I mean by that is,
[43:27.960 --> 43:28.960]  everyone will get a t-shirt,
[43:28.960 --> 43:30.960]  but these are going to be selling out.
[43:30.960 --> 43:32.960]  So whatever you order that day,
[43:32.960 --> 43:34.960]  they'll be the shirt of the day that's there
[43:34.960 --> 43:35.960]  until it sells out.
[43:35.960 --> 43:37.960]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up
[43:37.960 --> 43:38.960]  for the next group of orders.
[43:38.960 --> 43:39.960]  So in the next 12 days,
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.960]  we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[43:43.960 --> 43:44.960]  So this is a loss-leader.
[43:44.960 --> 43:46.960]  We are losing money on this.

[46:38.960 --> 46:39.960]  in the fight against the globalists.
[46:39.960 --> 46:43.960]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfowarsStore.com
[46:43.960 --> 46:46.960]  is super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[46:46.960 --> 46:49.960]  Fortified with colloidal silver and iodine is 60% off.
[46:49.960 --> 46:51.960]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[46:51.960 --> 46:53.960]  And as we prepare to close it out,
[46:53.960 --> 46:54.960]  I want to thank you all again
[46:54.960 --> 46:56.960]  for making the entire Infowar possible.
[46:56.960 --> 47:25.960]  Again, you are the Resistance.
[47:27.960 --> 47:29.960]  So let me quantify what I've been talking about
[47:29.960 --> 47:31.960]  the last 47 minutes here on air
[47:31.960 --> 47:34.960]  on this global Thursday transmission.
[47:34.960 --> 47:36.960]  You don't want to have an army
[47:36.960 --> 47:38.960]  that comes right over the hill and attacks people
[47:38.960 --> 47:40.960]  because even if you take over their military,
[47:40.960 --> 47:41.960]  the people will have their own culture,
[47:41.960 --> 47:42.960]  their own identity.
[47:42.960 --> 47:43.960]  They're going to fight back.
[47:43.960 --> 47:46.960]  So first you attack people's culture and identity.
[47:46.960 --> 47:47.960]  You make people hate their families,
[47:47.960 --> 47:49.960]  hate their fathers,
[47:49.960 --> 47:52.960]  and rebel against them.
[47:52.960 --> 47:53.960]  And then you put things like hydro,
[47:53.960 --> 47:57.960]  fornicic acid or weaponized sodium fluoride in the water
[47:57.960 --> 47:58.960]  that lowers IQ.
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.960]  But more importantly, acts as a sterilant and adjuvant
[48:03.960 --> 48:05.960]  that then accelerates, in many cases,
[48:05.960 --> 48:08.960]  other chemicals and other drugs being out of the water
[48:08.960 --> 48:12.960]  up to 100-plus times.
[48:12.960 --> 48:14.960]  Well, there's aluminum in a vaccine.
[48:14.960 --> 48:19.960]  It's an adjuvant or like nitrous oxide on a race car.
[48:19.960 --> 48:21.960]  You know, road warrior, humongous,
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.960]  just give us the gas, we spell your lives.
[48:23.960 --> 48:25.960]  Driving that big tractor and he goes,
[48:25.960 --> 48:29.960]  that's what it does.
[48:29.960 --> 48:31.960]  Nitrous oxide.
[48:31.960 --> 48:34.960]  So it's an accelerant.
[48:34.960 --> 48:36.960]  And it's in the White House Science,
[48:36.960 --> 48:38.960]  Zara's own book he wrote in 1974,
[48:38.960 --> 48:40.960]  Eco Science, how they would do it to us,
[48:40.960 --> 48:41.960]  how they were already doing it.
[48:41.960 --> 48:44.960]  It's in Rise and Fall, the Third Reich.
[48:44.960 --> 48:45.960]  They got to pull a surprise for it,
[48:45.960 --> 48:47.960]  how the Nazis were putting fluoride in the water
[48:47.960 --> 48:49.960]  to control their work camp people,
[48:49.960 --> 48:53.960]  how he learned it from Stalin.
[48:53.960 --> 48:57.960]  This is history, people.
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.960]  So now the fluoride's in the water.
[48:59.960 --> 49:01.960]  Now the families are getting broken up.
[49:01.960 --> 49:03.960]  Now they're adding chemicals into the environment
[49:03.960 --> 49:06.960]  that estrogenize women, give them cancer,
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.960]  make men feminine.
[49:10.960 --> 49:14.960]  That's the effect.
[49:14.960 --> 49:16.960]  And then they've got to get down to killing people.
[49:16.960 --> 49:19.960]  So you dumb them down, you divide them,
[49:19.960 --> 49:20.960]  you make them stupid, you make them evil,
[49:20.960 --> 49:22.960]  you get rid of their attention span.
[49:22.960 --> 49:24.960]  Their number one thing is getting rid of the attention span
[49:24.960 --> 49:26.960]  where people don't remember to carry out tasks,
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.960]  don't remember what happened before,
[49:28.960 --> 49:31.960]  don't follow through.
[49:31.960 --> 49:34.960]  So now that you've got a stunned,
[49:34.960 --> 49:37.960]  there are a lot of eagles and owls
[49:37.960 --> 49:42.960]  that'll grab turtles that have got snapping turtles
[49:42.960 --> 49:44.960]  and they'll take them up, they'll grab them,
[49:44.960 --> 49:46.960]  drop them on their head to what,
[49:46.960 --> 49:48.960]  kill them or stun them.
[49:48.960 --> 49:50.960]  Spiders stun their prey and then tie them up,
[49:50.960 --> 49:53.960]  let them assanguate, let them get juicy,
[49:53.960 --> 49:56.960]  and then suck out the delicious nectar.
[49:56.960 --> 50:00.960]  And see that's what's happening is that we're stung
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.960]  and we're put into a low brainwave state
[50:05.960 --> 50:07.960]  and then now what's already been tested
[50:07.960 --> 50:10.960]  in the third world and things now start giving them vaccines
[50:10.960 --> 50:12.960]  that we know statistically will brain damage
[50:12.960 --> 50:14.960]  a certain amount, will kill a certain amount,
[50:14.960 --> 50:16.960]  but you've got to have that because you want
[50:16.960 --> 50:18.960]  to further stun the general public.
[50:18.960 --> 50:20.960]  You're going to have higher numbers that die,
[50:20.960 --> 50:22.960]  higher numbers that convulse out,
[50:22.960 --> 50:25.960]  and you're going to practice managing the freak out
[50:25.960 --> 50:28.960]  and the convulsion and the death in the news,
[50:28.960 --> 50:31.960]  in the coals, everybody just gets used to it.
[50:31.960 --> 50:35.960]  Like censorship, you ask why do they pick off one
[50:35.960 --> 50:37.960]  and then pick off another and pick off another
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.960]  until you just get sick of hearing about it
[50:39.960 --> 50:43.960]  and you adapt to being prey.
[50:43.960 --> 50:45.960]  You adapt and accept they're coming for you
[50:45.960 --> 50:47.960]  and everyone else accepts it
[50:47.960 --> 50:49.960]  and no one organizes the fight.
[50:49.960 --> 50:51.960]  This is the program.
[50:51.960 --> 50:53.960]  But they've looked at the actuaries
[50:53.960 --> 50:54.960]  and the algorithms, the number,
[50:54.960 --> 50:56.960]  and they knew that info wars had triggered
[50:56.960 --> 50:59.960]  human survival instincts on a global scale
[50:59.960 --> 51:00.960]  because of you spreading the word,
[51:00.960 --> 51:05.960]  but because of my particular brand of truth,
[51:05.960 --> 51:12.960]  the tightness force and that will to survive,
[51:12.960 --> 51:16.960]  that will to defeat the enemy is strong.
[51:16.960 --> 51:19.960]  And they found us together, this operation,
[51:19.960 --> 51:21.960]  not just me, is able to break through the enemy
[51:21.960 --> 51:22.960]  like a battering ram,
[51:22.960 --> 51:26.960]  and we've blown major holes in their operations before,
[51:26.960 --> 51:29.960]  that we've crippled them.
[51:29.960 --> 51:31.960]  And so they desperately slammed on the accelerator,
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.960]  which is even more dangerous
[51:33.960 --> 51:35.960]  because they've got to get their program finished
[51:35.960 --> 51:36.960]  before we fully wake up
[51:36.960 --> 51:38.960]  so they're accelerating the death now.
[51:38.960 --> 51:40.960]  All over Europe, everywhere,
[51:40.960 --> 51:43.960]  that's why the left wants everyone banned from Facebook.
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.960]  They say, you can't let rural people
[51:45.960 --> 51:46.960]  or anyone on Facebook,
[51:46.960 --> 51:48.960]  they're going to get mad about vaccines killing them.
[51:48.960 --> 51:50.960]  They're going to get mad about all their pigs dying
[51:50.960 --> 51:52.960]  when they give them GMO corn.
[51:52.960 --> 51:53.960]  This is all being reported.
[51:53.960 --> 51:55.960]  They're going to get mad about, you know,
[51:55.960 --> 51:57.960]  a town of 1,000 people having 10,000 Muslims brought in
[51:57.960 --> 52:02.960]  and the police say they're allowed to rape you.
[52:02.960 --> 52:05.960]  Hillary said, you're going too quickly.
[52:05.960 --> 52:06.960]  But the globalists, some globalists say,
[52:06.960 --> 52:08.960]  no, we've got to accelerate.
[52:08.960 --> 52:10.960]  So if you look at a radio dial,
[52:10.960 --> 52:12.960]  or let's talk about an audio dial,
[52:12.960 --> 52:16.960]  an old radio or an old TV, you know, it goes one to 10.
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.960]  So see, you've got to slowly turn that up
[52:18.960 --> 52:20.960]  like the frog in the pie.
[52:20.960 --> 52:25.960]  Just go to Google, type in radio dial or audio dial.
[52:25.960 --> 52:27.960]  Or I'll look it up on my phone.
[52:27.960 --> 52:28.960]  I'll do that.
[52:28.960 --> 52:32.960]  So, and then they just slowly turn it up.
[52:32.960 --> 52:35.960]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[52:35.960 --> 52:39.960]  You know, it's killing you up there at six.
[52:39.960 --> 52:41.960]  It's absolutely, or I'll do it,
[52:41.960 --> 52:49.960]  it's absolutely killing you up there at six, seven, eight.
[52:49.960 --> 52:51.960]  Let me, let me search this myself.
[52:51.960 --> 52:52.960]  I'll get this done.
[52:52.960 --> 52:54.960]  It's no big deal.
[52:54.960 --> 52:56.960]  I'll go to the old evil Google.
[52:56.960 --> 52:57.960]  You know, they haven't censored yet.
[52:57.960 --> 52:59.960]  Being able to look up just regular things.
[52:59.960 --> 53:06.960]  It looks like audio dial, D-I-L-E, boom.
[53:06.960 --> 53:09.960]  And hit images.
[53:09.960 --> 53:12.960]  And, wow, look at that.
[53:12.960 --> 53:14.960]  Things are so digitized now.
[53:14.960 --> 53:16.960]  The symbols, document cam shot, please.
[53:16.960 --> 53:19.960]  The symbols now aren't even old radio dials.
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.960]  Just in 10 years, those are all phased out.
[53:21.960 --> 53:26.960]  That's why I said to do the search earlier for vintage.
[53:26.960 --> 53:29.960]  Vintage audio dial.
[53:29.960 --> 53:31.960]  And look, there's a vintage audio dial.
[53:31.960 --> 53:32.960]  So there you go.
[53:32.960 --> 53:34.960]  Now we've got one of everybody.
[53:34.960 --> 53:36.960]  So you see, it wasn't that hard.
[53:36.960 --> 53:38.960]  You turn it up.
[53:38.960 --> 53:42.960]  It's ambient until people get controlled and they get accustomed
[53:42.960 --> 53:44.960]  and they get used to more and more heat
[53:44.960 --> 53:47.960]  and they adapt to being put into this position
[53:47.960 --> 53:49.960]  and killed and destroyed.
[53:49.960 --> 53:51.960]  Their children dying, their neighbors dying.
[53:51.960 --> 53:53.960]  Everyone getting cancer.
[53:53.960 --> 54:01.960]  But it's done incrementally so the public begins to accept it.
[54:01.960 --> 54:08.960]  But the good news is there's now a congressperson in Tennessee
[54:08.960 --> 54:12.960]  that just got elected that's going to try to fulfill
[54:12.960 --> 54:14.960]  Trump's promise to investigate vaccines, investigate.
[54:14.960 --> 54:17.960]  It's like at the hearings where the Republicans say,
[54:17.960 --> 54:19.960]  you need an internal investigation of how you're censoring.
[54:19.960 --> 54:21.960]  They had all the leadership of Google two years ago
[54:21.960 --> 54:25.960]  when Hillary lost on their own internal TV feed saying,
[54:25.960 --> 54:28.960]  we're going to really crush conservatives now
[54:28.960 --> 54:30.960]  to make sure our world government doesn't fail
[54:30.960 --> 54:34.960]  and Hillary gets elected next time.
[54:34.960 --> 54:36.960]  And why are all these congressmen and people going public?
[54:36.960 --> 54:39.960]  Because their grandkids and their kids take the shot
[54:39.960 --> 54:42.960]  and never talk again or die.
[54:42.960 --> 54:44.960]  Why does Trump say he doesn't like vaccines?
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.960]  Because Barron got one when he was 18 months old
[54:46.960 --> 54:50.960]  and had the damn convulsion and stopped talking for a year.
[54:50.960 --> 54:53.960]  And until recently you could see him on television,
[54:53.960 --> 54:55.960]  you know, he's a little autistic.
[54:55.960 --> 54:57.960]  But he's a tough kid and got good genes
[54:57.960 --> 55:00.960]  so he'll end up being exceptional still.
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.960]  But boy did he take a big old lick upside the cerebral cortex.
[55:06.960 --> 55:09.960]  So you're under attack, folks,
[55:09.960 --> 55:11.960]  and they're turning the heat up so the nurses
[55:11.960 --> 55:13.960]  and the doctors who aren't really in on it,
[55:13.960 --> 55:16.960]  but once they cover up a convulsion,
[55:16.960 --> 55:18.960]  once they cover up somebody dying,
[55:18.960 --> 55:20.960]  once they're involved, they go to the ethics board
[55:20.960 --> 55:21.960]  and they go, what do we do?
[55:21.960 --> 55:24.960]  And they say, it's true, vaccines are hurting people.
[55:24.960 --> 55:27.960]  But they help so many others that it's a cost benefit,
[55:27.960 --> 55:30.960]  but don't tell the public they're too stupid.
[55:30.960 --> 55:31.960]  It's an appeal to elitism.
[55:31.960 --> 55:35.960]  I even had the head of the Texas Health Department division over that.
[55:35.960 --> 55:38.960]  I looked him up and he said it's an off-record thing, Alex,
[55:38.960 --> 55:41.960]  but so don't say my exact name, but you could talk about it.
[55:41.960 --> 55:43.960]  I was on the Hike and Bike trail about three years ago.
[55:43.960 --> 55:44.960]  And he goes, you're right.
[55:44.960 --> 55:46.960]  A lot of the vaccines are killing and hurting people,
[55:46.960 --> 55:49.960]  but we've got the numbers. Overall, they help more than they hurt.
[55:49.960 --> 55:51.960]  And I said, well, hey, that's not true.
[55:51.960 --> 55:52.960]  And I went over that, talked to him like 10 minutes,
[55:52.960 --> 55:55.960]  and he started really kind of a bit, and I guess you're right.
[55:55.960 --> 55:58.960]  And I said, and you're lying to people and telling them
[55:58.960 --> 56:01.960]  there's no problem because it's for their own good.
[56:01.960 --> 56:03.960]  That sound good to you?
[56:03.960 --> 56:05.960]  And the guy was pretty shaken because, you know,
[56:05.960 --> 56:07.960]  he was having guilt over it.
[56:07.960 --> 56:09.960]  So he thought he would tell me that it was for the greater good
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.960]  than I explained it wasn't.
[56:11.960 --> 56:14.960]  And I explained there's larger programs, adding things to them,
[56:14.960 --> 56:17.960]  and I gave him examples, and the guy was pretty damn shook up.
[56:17.960 --> 56:18.960]  I looked up his name.
[56:18.960 --> 56:21.960]  Soon as I got the car on the little smartphone that tracks me
[56:21.960 --> 56:24.960]  and sure as hell, he was the head of the entire program
[56:24.960 --> 56:26.960]  for said texts.
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.960]  And I looked at him up at the top of the hill that we'd hiked up.
[56:34.960 --> 56:42.960]  And I said, this is going to come back on you and your family.
[56:42.960 --> 56:44.960]  It's the way the universe works.
[56:44.960 --> 56:49.960]  And I said, you can rationalize this crap all day long.
[56:49.960 --> 56:51.960]  And I said, you don't look like an evil person,
[56:51.960 --> 56:54.960]  but you've been seduced into this that you're part of the establishment
[56:54.960 --> 56:56.960]  and you know that you sit around these committee rooms
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.960]  and you decide who lives and who dies.
[57:00.960 --> 57:03.960]  I said, just remember, there are committees above you
[57:03.960 --> 57:05.960]  that see you the same damn way.
[57:05.960 --> 57:10.960]  And I said, why don't you grow up and be a real man?
[57:10.960 --> 57:12.960]  And that guy started crying.
[57:12.960 --> 57:14.960]  I said, now you think about it.
[57:14.960 --> 57:16.960]  And I left.
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.960]  And that's my final message on the subject everybody today.
[57:19.960 --> 57:22.960]  You better decide which side you're on because this is going on
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.960]  and everybody in their gut knows it.
[57:24.960 --> 57:26.960]  Everybody in their soul knows it.
[57:26.960 --> 57:29.960]  You can intellectually prove it all scientifically.
[57:29.960 --> 57:31.960]  So am I worried about getting killed myself?
[57:31.960 --> 57:33.960]  Am I worried about being taken off the air?
[57:33.960 --> 57:34.960]  No.
[57:34.960 --> 57:37.960]  I'm worried about you not having a spirit to stand up against this
[57:37.960 --> 57:41.960]  and say, no, we're really going to let these mad sides
[57:41.960 --> 57:43.960]  pull all this crap off on us?
[57:43.960 --> 58:12.960]  And I say, hell no, humanity must awaken.
[58:13.960 --> 58:16.960]  Now more than ever, InfoWars, it needs your support
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.960]  to continue to promote the spirit of liberty and Americana.
[58:19.960 --> 58:21.960]  The truly is the Christmas spirit.
[58:21.960 --> 58:24.960]  When you shop at InfoWarsStore.com, you don't just get incredible sales
[58:24.960 --> 58:26.960]  during the 12 days of Christmas.
[58:26.960 --> 58:28.960]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[58:28.960 --> 58:32.960]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfoWarsStore.com
[58:32.960 --> 58:35.960]  is super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[58:35.960 --> 58:38.960]  4 to 5 colloidal silver and iodine is 60% off.
[58:38.960 --> 58:40.960]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[58:40.960 --> 58:43.960]  And as we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again
[58:43.960 --> 58:46.960]  for making the entire InfoWars possible.
[58:46.960 --> 58:48.960]  Again, you are the resistance.
[58:50.960 --> 58:52.960]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers
[58:52.960 --> 58:56.960]  how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalist.
[58:56.960 --> 58:58.960]  So let's say it's short and sweet.
[58:58.960 --> 59:00.960]  We are your support now more than ever.
[59:00.960 --> 59:03.960]  You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you.
[59:03.960 --> 59:06.960]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[59:06.960 --> 59:10.960]  The attacks on InfoWars have become absolutely exponential.
[59:10.960 --> 59:12.960]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[59:12.960 --> 59:15.960]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart
[59:15.960 --> 59:18.960]  that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible
[59:18.960 --> 59:21.960]  and go through as much as we can to be an example to others
[59:21.960 --> 59:25.960]  and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[59:25.960 --> 59:27.960]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[59:27.960 --> 59:28.960]  I need to be provisioned.
[59:28.960 --> 59:30.960]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros
[59:30.960 --> 59:32.960]  and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshipers.
[59:32.960 --> 59:34.960]  But I need your prayers.
[59:34.960 --> 59:35.960]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[59:35.960 --> 59:37.960]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[59:37.960 --> 59:38.960]  We make it easy.
[59:38.960 --> 59:40.960]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[59:40.960 --> 59:43.960]  Not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon.
[59:43.960 --> 59:45.960]  And you'll help provision us.
[59:45.960 --> 59:48.960]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at InfoWars.com.
[59:48.960 --> 1:00:16.960]  So please take action right now.
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:27.960]  It's a fact that the Chinese, that the Russians,
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:30.960]  that the European nations, the Germans particularly,
[1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:34.960]  the British out of control, have done massive secret
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  lethal testing on men, women and children.
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:39.960]  It's all declassified.
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:42.960]  Do you want me to list some of the more famous stuff?
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:44.960]  Everybody's heard about Tuskegee.
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:46.960]  Have you heard about nerve-gassing British troops
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:48.960]  and thousands of tests that killed thousands?
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.960]  How about spraying Scottish and Irish towns with nerve gas
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:52.960]  or bio weapons?
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:53.960]  That's all declassified.
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:01:01.960]  How about taking disabled children at the Department of Energy
[1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:05.960]  starting in the 50s and putting them in radiation chambers,
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:07.960]  like something out of Wrath of Khan,
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:10.960]  when Spock's in there, and frying them?
[1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:14.960]  In some cases, with such high radiation,
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:17.960]  the children's skin, they'd put them in there,
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:22.960]  would stick to the metal floor, frying them like eggs.
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:27.960]  Only the strongest scientist for the greater good can do it.
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:29.960]  Only, yes, they...
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.960]  And you know, the Japanese, and their secret task,
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:34.960]  going back to World War I,
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.960]  they would either use prisoners of war,
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.960]  because they were seen as men,
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:40.960]  and given up, so they were dishonored.
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:42.960]  But they wouldn't test them in general public.
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:45.960]  They would have Japanese men in the warrior class
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:48.960]  volunteer to be tested on until they died.
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.960]  There was only one other group they could find
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:51.960]  that would do that in the U.S.
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:53.960]  That was the Seventh Day Adventists.
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:57.960]  The Seventh Day Adventists are some really tough hombres.
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:00.960]  Thousands of them in declassified documents
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.960]  submitted to lethal testing
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:05.960]  with chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals.
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.960]  They literally allowed themselves to be killed.
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.960]  They believed for the greater Christian faith.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.960]  I said that was being manipulated and twisted.
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.960]  But that's why the Seventh Day Adventists
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:19.960]  were very important for secret operations and things.
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:21.960]  Because if you're willing to die in radiation
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:23.960]  or biological or chemical tests,
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:25.960]  well, you're going to be the person we send on missions
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:29.960]  to kill people, too.
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:32.960]  And just so happens,
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:37.960]  my mother worked for some certain people up in Dallas.
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:41.960]  And when I was a little kid, when I was a baby,
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:43.960]  she was pregnant, actually.
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:45.960]  Richard Nixon would call up on the telephone
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:50.960]  and she'd give the phone to the Seventh Day Adventists gentlemen.
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.960]  And I'm not Seventh Day Adventists.
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:54.960]  They just like my parents.
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:56.960]  I have no idea why they were working there.
[1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:59.960]  The point is, is that this is the type of stuff
[1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:03.960]  that's going on and the public are a bunch of naive people
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:06.960]  if they don't grow up now.
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.960]  Stop it.
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.960]  Stop being naive.
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:13.960]  This project needs to end and Trump's damn well trying to end it.
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:17.960]  That's why they're so pissed.
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:19.960]  Let me tell you all this MK ultra crap.
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:21.960]  At the end of the day,
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:23.960]  it's about getting a bunch of people involved in criminal stuff
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:25.960]  so the pedophiles can compromise them
[1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:28.960]  and get away with screwing and killing kids.
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:32.960]  You know, what did I say five years ago when they said
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:37.960]  we're going to have gay scout leaders?
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:40.960]  I'm not against men that like men or vice versa.
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:43.960]  But when you want to put someone who's into sex
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:46.960]  and makes it a point in with a bunch of young men or boys,
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:49.960]  you're going to have sexual abuse just like the Catholic Church.
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:52.960]  Oh, and now the Boy Scouts of America is set to go bankrupt
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  because of all the lawsuits.
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:57.960]  What do you think you do at the World Jamboree
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:01.960]  where they handed out condoms to young boys as young as seven
[1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:03.960]  with groups of men?
[1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:08.960]  That would be freaking gross if I showed up as an adult at some resort
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:12.960]  and there were 10,000 people and they were handed out condoms to everybody.
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:14.960]  I'd be like, I don't want to get diseases.
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:15.960]  What the hell is that?
[1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:18.960]  It would just sound, you know, it's like going to somebody's house in Hollywood
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:21.960]  and they got 20 hookers there and it's kind of obscene.
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:24.960]  You're like, look, these women are bowls of peanuts or something.
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:26.960]  I'm getting out of here.
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:30.960]  But imagine you show up and little kids are like bowls of peanuts.
[1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:36.960]  They are bowls of nuts and potato chips.
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.960]  Just, hey, you want this one? You want that one?
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.960]  I didn't do that.
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  Imagine little kids.
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.960]  They say, oh, this is what we do.
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  We're just going to screw these little kids
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:50.960]  and then we're going to blow up the Boy Scouts of America
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:53.960]  and we all let everybody do it because we don't want to be homophobic.
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:56.960]  Come on in here. Screw my kid in the ass. It's all right. It's liberal.
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:26.960]  I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:30.960]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.960]  on m4select, storeable foods.
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:34.960]  They've got special diet foods.
[1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:36.960]  They've got three month supplies, your supplies.
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:38.960]  Weak emergency supplies.
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.960]  They've got so many great products there.
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:41.960]  And you've got a three year supply.
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:43.960]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:46.960]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:49.960]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.
[1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:51.960]  With God's help, we are unstoppable.
[1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:54.960]  m4store.com and m4select high quality storeable foods
[1:05:54.960 --> 1:06:23.960]  powered by my Patriot supply.
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:32.960]  We look at Antifa. We look at some of these groups.
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.960]  These are violent people.
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:36.960]  We'll have a little bit more here in a second.
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:38.960]  Michael, you know where he's trafficking.
[1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:41.960]  He's trafficking in this part of the Republican base.
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:44.960]  It's not fair to call it the Republican base, although that's what it is now.
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  But I think it fairs us to you.
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:47.960]  Trump voters.
[1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:48.960]  Trump voters.
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:51.960]  He's trafficking in their conspiracies.
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:54.960]  Yeah, and he talked to Antifa.
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:56.960]  An issue in Portland, Oregon.
[1:06:56.960 --> 1:06:58.960]  Okay, I will grant you that.
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:00.960]  But this is not a giant issue.
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:03.960]  This reminds me a lot of his initial reaction to Charlottesville.
[1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:08.960]  This desire to talk about violence on the left as somehow equal to
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:11.960]  or perhaps greater than violence on the right.
[1:07:11.960 --> 1:07:13.960]  Or to rationalize violence.
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:16.960]  I think he just wants to rationalize violence.
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:23.960]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the N-word?
[1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:26.960]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.960]  and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:32.960]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:36.960]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:39.960]  I wouldn't support that group, would you?
[1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:44.960]  This has been a public service announcement from Infowars.com.
[1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:46.960]  And Antifa!
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:52.960]  It's literally a ruck to me.
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:58.960]  But those about to ruck, we saw you kill.
[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:05.960]  But those about to ruck, we saw you kill.
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:12.960]  But those about to ruck, we saw you kill.
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:17.960]  Holding up, it's okay to be white-sized.
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:20.960]  You know, I think it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black.
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:23.960]  It's awesome to be human, isn't it, Gavin McInnis?
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:26.960]  I don't know about this day and age, things are changing.
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  I'm at the point now where I think it's not okay to be white, it's not okay to support Trump,
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:33.960]  it's not okay to be American. I think we lost.
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:37.960]  And by the way, it's a bunch of white liberals creating a race war.
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:39.960]  All the quote minorities I know aren't even into this crap.
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:45.960]  Oh, you talk to black people and they don't know, they're not familiar with all of these isms
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  and intersectionality and that sign and all this crap.
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:54.960]  It's a purely upper elite white liberal thing.
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.960]  Trying to divide and conquer us.
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.960]  Ann Coulter would play this clip.
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.960]  We've got a bunch of these clips, we'll get to it in a few minutes.
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:05.960]  Ann Coulter has come out and said, and she lists the New York Times,
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:09.960]  board members saying whites are subhuman goblins that live in holes, should be exterminated.
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:11.960]  She lists all these other shows saying whites are inherently evil,
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:13.960]  that being white is bad, that white men are the problem.
[1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:18.960]  They've all said it on these channels, white, black, Hispanic commentators trying to create race war.
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:21.960]  And then Ann Coulter says, you hate white people and they call for her
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  to be taking off Fox as a commentator saying she's a racist.
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:27.960]  So they're all saying whites are inherently evil,
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:31.960]  but then if you say that's racist, then you're back.
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:36.960]  I'm just so sick of talking about it too, like when you talk to your friends and stuff,
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:40.960]  you talk about the economy, you talk about jobs, you talk about what's fun,
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:44.960]  you talk about real estate girls, AC DC, are all those songs the same?
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:47.960]  Were they the first punk band?
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:49.960]  No, they're all the same, but they're all good.
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:51.960]  Exactly, they got the formula, like the Ramones.
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:56.960]  And then you tune in to the elite liberal class at the New York Times,
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:00.960]  and it's race-ity, race-race-race, and it's just exhausting.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:01.960]  It's not normal.
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:05.960]  I never thought about what color people were until the last few years,
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:07.960]  and now it's just everywhere.
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:09.960]  America is not racist.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  Stop it.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:13.960]  These hate has no home here signs are driving me insane.
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:17.960]  You might as well have a sign in your yard that says rape has no home here.
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:19.960]  Yeah, I know hate has no home here.
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:22.960]  You go to a bar, you walk, oh, the South is evil.
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:24.960]  You walk around the South and you see a bunch of people.
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:25.960]  There's a black guy in line.
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:26.960]  How you doing?
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:27.960]  Oh, hey, Daryl.
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:28.960]  How's your mom?
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:30.960]  And then you go to the New York Times and it's like,
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:32.960]  oh, the white people are being burned.
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:33.960]  Oh, the Klan.
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:37.960]  And literally every one of the cross-burnings or poop swastikas
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:40.960]  or things at the military academies is staged by the left.
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.960]  Every one of them is staged.
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:45.960]  It's become this paranoia, this manic obsession.
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:48.960]  Remember that girl who called the police
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:51.960]  because she saw there was a Klan rally going on in her college.
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:53.960]  And the college goes, what?
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:55.960]  We don't remember renting out the room.
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:59.960]  It was a dust jacket on a microscope that had a pointy top
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:01.960]  because that's how dust jackets.
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:04.960]  Oh, it's like saying, it's like up in Omaha, Nebraska,
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:06.960]  of all places that the principal says,
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  listen, candy canes are Jays for Jesus, their band,
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  and red and green.
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:13.960]  I mean, this is happening.
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:15.960]  Remember the Hitler teapot?
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  JC Penney has a teapot that has a normal handle.
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:19.960]  Oh, yeah.
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:23.960]  But then it did a reflection that maybe you could,
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:25.960]  maybe somebody would see Hitler,
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:27.960]  if you're mentally ill obsessed with Hitler,
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:29.960]  and they said, you're right, we're taking,
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  we're getting rid of that teapot.
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.960]  I call them not-see glasses, not-see glasses,
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:35.960]  because we would do this thing on my old show
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:39.960]  where we'd come up with anything, socks, mustaches, licorice.
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:41.960]  No matter what we came up with,
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  it was that we could find someone saying it was racist.
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:47.960]  No matter what.
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  Gavin McGinnis is here with us in the studio.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:51.960]  We'll obviously get into your massively platforming.
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.960]  You're now joining the Elite Club
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:55.960]  of Superdangerously Established.
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:57.960]  We'll talk about why in the next segment,
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:11:59.960]  but let's talk about, because it's something you never do,
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:01.960]  where people can still find you,
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:03.960]  because they love you and you're super,
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:05.960]  even bigger like Supernova.
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:07.960]  Sun blows up, it's really big for a while,
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:09.960]  but we need to get everybody to understand,
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:11.960]  like I told you, you should be trying to get your fans
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:14.960]  and listeners to send you their email and newsletter,
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:16.960]  so that no matter what, at least for now,
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:18.960]  you can still get to them,
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  because we're moving towards them banning URLs.
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:22.960]  Oh yeah, well, banks are coming next.
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:24.960]  I mean, I'm off PayPal.
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:27.960]  There's lots of people in the SPLC's hate list,
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:29.960]  and the hate list for the SPLC, of course,
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  includes anyone who's Christian,
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:33.960]  who's against gay adoption,
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:35.960]  anyone basically right-wing is on that list,
[1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:38.960]  and banks will then get pressured from the SPLC and the ADL.
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:41.960]  Oh, the new thing is, if you don't let Nambla into your school,
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:43.960]  posing as the, quote, drag queen club,
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:45.960]  a huge fat guy with a wig on,
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:48.960]  and don't let them talk to your five-year-old about their ding-dong,
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:50.960]  and if you don't let them do that, then you're a hate group.
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:51.960]  Yes.
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  And by the way,
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:55.960]  by the way, we've had not a lot of states with some complain and say,
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:57.960]  Alex, please don't talk about it.
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:12:58.960]  I didn't used to do this.
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:01.960]  They're teaching five-year-olds and two-year-olds this.
[1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:03.960]  I have to tell you what they're doing.
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:08.960]  I can't even, I can't even show video we shot at public events in Austin
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.960]  with men out in the public with glitter on their genitals.
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:12.960]  Oh, I remember that.
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:13.960]  And the guy should be in porn.
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:14.960]  It's like an elephant trunk.
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:16.960]  He's got, we can't even show it because stations get mad,
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:19.960]  and they've got two-year-old kids hugging a guy naked,
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:21.960]  but I can't show the video.
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:22.960]  I'm the bad guy.
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:24.960]  This is unbelievable.
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:27.960]  You know, in Pat Buchanan's book, Death of the West,
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:29.960]  he talks about the Frankfurt School,
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:33.960]  and he says that they, what they do is they call you race.
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:38.960]  If an opponent becomes too much of a hindrance,
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:41.960]  then just call them Nazi and racist again and again and again,
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:44.960]  and then they spend their time defending that,
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:46.960]  and they lose their power.
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:47.960]  They change the subject.
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:48.960]  And we're just busy.
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:49.960]  Hey, go ahead.
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:50.960]  Have sex with our kids.
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:51.960]  Don't call us racist.
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:52.960]  I'm not racist.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:53.960]  And it worked.
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:55.960]  I mean, if you say, where can people find me?
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:56.960]  Nowhere.
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:57.960]  I'm done.
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  I mean, I've heard them back on YouTube.
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:00.960]  That's not going to last,
[1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:02.960]  but I got kicked off of every platform,
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:06.960]  and now they can do this, this, they can take this narrative
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:09.960]  and just make me whoever they want, and I can't defend myself.
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:13.960]  So they de-platform you, they dehumanize you,
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:15.960]  and then, well, they don't even have to kill you
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:16.960]  because you don't exist.
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:18.960]  I don't exist anymore.
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:21.960]  I've been erased.
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:25.960]  And once you're erased, they can make up whatever they want.
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  They, they want us dead.
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:29.960]  I mean, if Van Coulter was killed.
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:30.960]  But that's the worst part.
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:31.960]  They don't just shut you down.
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.960]  Then they really start lying.
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  Yeah.
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:35.960]  You're like tied up in the ring,
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:36.960]  and they're like punching you.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.960]  And it's, here's another trick that, that, that left it does.
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.960]  They threaten your family, right?
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:45.960]  They don't want to ever be put pictures of their kids up.
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:47.960]  So you look at someone like Chris Hayes, Mark Rufalo,
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:50.960]  all these other activists, they, they're in pictures with their kids.
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:51.960]  And you go, oh, that's a human.
[1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:52.960]  That's a dad.
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.960]  That's a wonderful family person.
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:55.960]  But then with, with you,
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:56.960]  We can't show our family.
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:57.960]  We can't show our kids.
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:00.960]  And then just use a picture where you're scowling like this,
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:02.960]  and then you can make him more and more of the villain,
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  dehumanize him more and more.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:06.960]  And then he can die.
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:07.960]  He can vanish.
[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:09.960]  I didn't get rid of a person's voice.
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:11.960]  I got rid of Hitler.
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:13.960]  And then I know we talked about this in private.
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:15.960]  And then I kind of advise not to give him attention,
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:19.960]  but maybe we should because the same guy that literally edited in audio,
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:21.960]  Mike Cernovich torturing his baby daughter,
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:23.960]  which he didn't do, that's a criminal offense.
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:25.960]  I mean, that's not just doxing.
[1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:26.960]  That's, that's, you know,
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:29.960]  where you call the police on somebody with a false report.
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.960]  What do they call it?
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:32.960]  Swatting.
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  Right.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:34.960]  So they try to swat him,
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.960]  the same guy put out fake edited videos of you,
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:38.960]  and they're praised by the left.
[1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:39.960]  I mean, that's what they do to me.
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:42.960]  They edit these videos out of contents or audio.
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:43.960]  And then they do this.
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  So Gavin McGinnis is our guest.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:47.960]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:49.960]  You don't have a website?
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:50.960]  Nope.
[1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:52.960]  Son, we can get you one of those in five minutes.
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:16:17.960]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:24.960]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:53.960]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:55.960]  We'll be right back.
[1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.960]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:31.960]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:32.960]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:35.960]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:37.960]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:39.960]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:41.960]  they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:42.960]  I can help you too.
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:44.960]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:45.960]  Don't wait another day.
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:47.960]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website,
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:53.960]  danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com,

[1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.960]  But with the rapid speed of life,
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:27.960]  we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:57.960]  That's infowarslife.com.
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:00.960]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:02.960]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:04.960]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:06.960]  that it lowers IQ.
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:09.960]  It literally dumps the population down.
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:11.960]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:13.960]  the best iodine in the world,
[1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:15.960]  we've gone through two permutations.
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:18.960]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:19.960]  but hard to source.
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:22.960]  And the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:25.960]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.960]  and brought you X2.
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:28.960]  That's been incredible.
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:30.960]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:34.960]  we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:36.960]  of nascent iodine.
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:39.960]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:41.960]  that by combining it with three other compounds,
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:44.960]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:48.960]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:50.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:52.960]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:20:21.960]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:27.960]  All right, Gavin has really freaked out, Gavin McGinnis.
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:32.960]  And he wants to talk about Proud Boys and what he was told to do.
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:34.960]  You're going to get the big inside baseball.
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:37.960]  New York, if you know a month ago, all these,
[1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:39.960]  they're having an event.
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:42.960]  Antifa shows up with metal clubs, you name it, to attack them.
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.960]  They attack. Proud Boys fight back.
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:46.960]  It's all in video.
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:48.960]  The police indict them, trying to put them in prison,
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:50.960]  and they tell them, the prosecutors,
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.960]  and you just tell me if we can talk about this.
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:55.960]  Say you disavow Proud Boys, say all this,
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:20:58.960]  and we will drop, you know, we'll go light on them.
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:20:59.960]  Well, now they're sentencing us today,
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:01.960]  and now they've backed off on that.
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:02.960]  That's how it works.
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:04.960]  It's how the FBI works, how the Democrats work.
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:08.960]  And so, they get you to disavow them.
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:10.960]  That's meant to make it sound like you don't like Proud Boys.
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:13.960]  At the same time, they have the FBI with no proof,
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:16.960]  and turn out they didn't say it, say that they're an extremist group.
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.960]  And it turns out that didn't happen.
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:22.960]  And so, this is all a giant setup to discredit Proud Boys.
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:23.960]  Why?
[1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:25.960]  So, before we go there, tell them what Proud Boys is,
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:28.960]  what Antifa is, why they're so angry at you.
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:31.960]  They admit that Antifa is the paramilitary of the left
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:33.960]  to go out and intimidate people.
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:34.960]  The mayor is horrible in Portland.
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:36.960]  Anybody that tries to protest him has their head beat in.
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:37.960]  The police let them do it.
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:39.960]  I mean, you talk about civil rights violation.
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:41.960]  You have them, McGinnis, get into this.
[1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:44.960]  Okay, the Proud Boys are a group like the Elks Lodge.
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:45.960]  They just drink beer.
[1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:47.960]  That's 99% of what they do.
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:51.960]  They love Trump, and these clubs used to be everywhere.
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:53.960]  Then we started getting attacked.
[1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:55.960]  I got pepper sprayed at NYU.
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:21:59.960]  Lawrence Southern had urine covered in pith.
[1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:02.960]  Excuse my language, twice, twice.
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:03.960]  I've had them throw it on me.
[1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:05.960]  They throw feces at us, batteries.
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:07.960]  Feces urine, it's mixed together.
[1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:10.960]  Yes, I was just in Britain with Tommy Robinson,
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:13.960]  and they were throwing feces from their own,
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:14.960]  like the supporters were there,
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:16.960]  and then Antifa were in the back, whatever you want to call them,
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:18.960]  throwing, but anyway, so, totally under attacks.
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:21.960]  Joey Gibson can't walk down to Portland.
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:23.960]  So they started going to these events and saying,
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:26.960]  well, just surround them and be like bodyguards,
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:28.960]  like the guardian angels kind of thing.
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:29.960]  Now, they're always disarmed.
[1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:30.960]  This is what no one gets.
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  They're always disarmed because they go through
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:34.960]  the police barrier to be with the speaker.
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:36.960]  And they walk into a trap, real heroes.
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:38.960]  The police will disarm you, but then when they leave,
[1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:40.960]  they're going out of the police perimeter,
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.960]  and they're now totally disarmed,
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:44.960]  and they're getting beaten with those collapsible battens
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:47.960]  like Rufio was, and so they fight back.
[1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:49.960]  Show Rufio when they try to hit him with metal batons
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:50.960]  and show Antifa violence.
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:51.960]  Go ahead.
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:52.960]  Keep going.
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:56.960]  Okay, so you get someone like Beck, Glenn Beck says to me,
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:22:58.960]  you know, you got to go to the Martin Luther King route,
[1:22:58.960 --> 1:22:59.960]  and you got to get away from this violence.
[1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:01.960]  What was Rufio supposed to do in that scenario?
[1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:03.960]  A guy comes at him with a metal baton,
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:05.960]  listed as a death weapon.
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:07.960]  Those things will open up your face.
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:10.960]  They'll do permanent damage to you.
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:12.960]  They could kill you.
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.960]  They could put an entrance in a bullwhip.
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.960]  So yeah, and this isn't like the freedom riders.
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:19.960]  So the guy comes at you with a steel baton, a murder weapon.
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:20.960]  Tell me what to do.
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:21.960]  You're supposed to murder me.
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:22.960]  Yeah.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:23.960]  No, no, no.
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:24.960]  You defend yourself, you're a bad guy.
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:25.960]  Yeah, Joey Gibson, I love him.
[1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:26.960]  And he says the same thing.
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.960]  He goes, no, you just got to take the beating.
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:30.960]  And I go, but that's, could be fatal.
[1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:32.960]  You look at the weapons that we're confident in.
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:34.960]  But that's why it's essential that we don't even call it
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:35.960]  proud boys.
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:37.960]  Men need to go to every gun rally,
[1:23:37.960 --> 1:23:39.960]  land rights rally, anti-globalist rally.
[1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:42.960]  You just, you have a right under law to defend
[1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:43.960]  and stand against these guys.
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:46.960]  So the reason you're bad is you rallied a bunch of men
[1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:48.960]  to just simply stand up to these guys
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:49.960]  and they got their ass kicked
[1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:51.960]  and they're a bunch of meth head professors and they're pissed.
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:53.960]  And by the way, these guys, proud boys,
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:55.960]  never go to Antifa events.
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:56.960]  They don't pick fights.
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:00.960]  They just defend conservatives, Trump supporters.
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:01.960]  They're not even that conservative.
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:02.960]  Well, it's just like England A-group.
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:05.960]  They're most England and Canada and liberal cities.
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:07.960]  You'll hear about a muggers raping a guy's daughter
[1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:11.960]  and the father attacks the rapist and he goes to jail.
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:12.960]  Yeah.
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:13.960]  That's a big fear of mine too.
[1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:15.960]  And you know what's crazy in all of this?
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:18.960]  Antifa are kind of victims in a sense.
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:19.960]  Hear me out.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:21.960]  Like that guy we're talking about who edits the videos.
[1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:25.960]  He doxxed Cernovich's event, Night for Freedom, right?
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:27.960]  And Antifa shows up, starts attacking.
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:29.960]  They're calling for our children and stuff and murder
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:31.960]  and they want to kill Mike's kids.
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:32.960]  Crazy crap.
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:34.960]  And this old Jewish guy is leaving
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  and the police go, you should probably go in a taxi, sir.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:37.960]  And he goes, what?
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:38.960]  No.
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:39.960]  This is America.
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:40.960]  I'm not a pedophile.
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:42.960]  I don't need to be escorted out.
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:45.960]  So he walks out and gets jumped by Antifa.
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:47.960]  They start choking him, punch him.
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:50.960]  He has a heart attack and he's whisked away to the hospital.
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:52.960]  Then the cops grab this Antifa kid.
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:55.960]  His name, I think, is David Campbell.
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:57.960]  And he starts fighting the cops.
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.960]  He's looking at 15 years.
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:02.960]  And in his crazy brain, he'd been brainwashed
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.960]  by all these lunatics on the left into thinking
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  that he was genuinely, you know, killing him.
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:08.960]  Remember how Hillary was running, mate?
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.960]  Senator Cain's son was organizing this stuff.
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:12.960]  Yep.
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:14.960]  And Tim Cain said, we need to take these fights to the streets.
[1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:17.960]  So this lie about Nazis being everywhere.
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:18.960]  Yeah, no.
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:21.960]  You send your jerk kids out here to beat up women and children,
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:23.960]  a few men show up and kick your ass when you attack them,
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:25.960]  and then they're the bad guys.
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  And so the bottom line is,
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:27.960]  But that's plain.
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:29.960]  You didn't throw problems on the bus.
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:32.960]  When they got set up and for defending themselves,
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.960]  you were told, do this.
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:35.960]  We won't put them in prison.
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:36.960]  Of course you wouldn't.
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:38.960]  No, they said that the push for the prosecution
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:39.960]  is going to be that it's a gang,
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:41.960]  and that gangs are two things.
[1:25:41.960 --> 1:25:43.960]  They do illegal activities, and they have a leader.
[1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:44.960]  So get rid of the leader,
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:47.960]  and we're helping get rid of this lie that they're a gang.
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:49.960]  And it won't drop the charges, but it might leave it.
[1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  They're looking at felony riot.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:53.960]  And here's the crazy part.
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:55.960]  Every time I talk to cops about this,
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:57.960]  they go, I don't know who you pissed off,
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:25:59.960]  but something crazy is going on.
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:02.960]  Because exactly that night, it's not what this is on camera.
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:04.960]  Tell folks the rest of the story.
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:06.960]  When the cops are there for your event,
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:07.960]  they stand by and watch this,
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  and then when they arrest your guys and protect Antifa,
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:13.960]  they're going, F you pig, F you scum, hope you die.
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  Okay, this is literally the top group.
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.960]  They were attacking the venue five days before the venue had me.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.960]  It's like knocking windows out, putting super glue on the wall.
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:26.960]  Calling the poor old lady who works there,
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:27.960]  saying things I can't say on the air
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  about what they're going to do to her.
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:30.960]  Calls coming from all over the country, by the way.
[1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:32.960]  Why do you care about a Manhattan club?
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:35.960]  And it was this joke because they want to silence you.
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:36.960]  Then they vandalize the club.
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:37.960]  They say, this is just the beginning.
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:40.960]  Then they show up and they just, their signs were too nice.
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:43.960]  There's guys in the crowd who don't look like they have any idea who I am.
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:45.960]  They look like they were paid protesters.
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:47.960]  The signs, when was embroidered
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.960]  and it looked like a $3,000 cloth sign.
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:51.960]  That was very suspicious.
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:52.960]  It was not organic.
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:54.960]  Anyway, they're there attacking people.
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:57.960]  They attack one reporter, beat him up, take his equipment
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.960]  and for that, three people were charged, right?
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:03.960]  Nothing to do with proud boys or anything.
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:07.960]  That was just two random guys who saw Antifa obliterating a reporter
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:09.960]  and Antifa got arrested for that.
[1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:10.960]  No one talks about that.
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:12.960]  So that was the first confrontation.
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:14.960]  Then at the end of the night, they make us all wait.
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:17.960]  They disperse the mob, they disperse Antifa
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:19.960]  and then they say, okay, everyone's gone.
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:22.960]  And then the police take these proud boys, about 20 proud boys.
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:25.960]  I leave separately as they throw urine at my car.
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:27.960]  And I go, I'll tell you, I'm a Gucci
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:30.960]  and I wave this plastic sword that everyone makes.
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:32.960]  Everyone makes it look so sinister.
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:34.960]  It's a broken plastic kids toy.
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:37.960]  Anyway, they escort 20 proud boys to the train.
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:39.960]  Antifa had been dispersed.
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:43.960]  They went around the block, came back, ambushed these guys,
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:47.960]  peed at them again and starts winning.
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:48.960]  They actually was kicking them when they're down,
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:49.960]  if you watch the video.
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:51.960]  And then the proud boys fight back
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:54.960]  and the cops go, are you okay to Antifa?
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:57.960]  They're gonna press charges and they say F you pig.
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:02.960]  And the way the law works is if you come up to a fight
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:04.960]  and both guys say it's okay officer,
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:05.960]  then the officer walks away.
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:07.960]  You need a victim for assault.
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:10.960]  You need a dead body for murder.
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:11.960]  We've all seen the video.
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:13.960]  Let's show the video again where Antifa,
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  I mean, go back to the night of the event.
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:17.960]  What should they type in to get that video up?
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.960]  And Antifa, all these meth head looking guys
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:21.960]  that have thighs that are like an inch around,
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:24.960]  like they're insects come marching up the huge dudes,
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:26.960]  throwing bottles at them, kicking people.
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:27.960]  And then they get their ass kicked.
[1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:29.960]  And then they wonder why.
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:32.960]  I mean, let me tell you, I'm not the toughest guy around.
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:34.960]  I mean, it's not, I've only beat together a couple of people.
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.960]  But the point is, these guys,
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:38.960]  I could literally take on 10 of them.
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:41.960]  And the thing is, you pull out a metal baton on me,
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:44.960]  that's when I actually flip out and become dangerous.
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:45.960]  Because that's what my brain is.
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:47.960]  You pull a baton out, I'm joking with you.
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.960]  The point is, is they pull a metal baton out, man.
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:51.960]  It's over. That's why I can't go out now.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:53.960]  Because if they do that to me,
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:56.960]  I'm telling you, man, it'd be bad news.
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  Hear that?
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:00.960]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:03.960]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:26.960]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:36.960]  If you take meds, then suffer stomach distress,
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:39.960]  constipation, indigestion, acid reflux, or bloating,
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:40.960]  and nothing else helps.

[1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.960]  is Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste.

[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:50.960]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:52.960]  And as we prepare to close it out,
[1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:55.960]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire Info War possible.
[1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:58.960]  Again, you are the resistance.
[1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:01.960]  It does. History documents it.
[1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:05.960]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history
[1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:07.960]  that wants to hurt children.
[1:31:07.960 --> 1:31:10.960]  They want to abort children. They want to disease children.
[1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.960]  They want to abuse children. They want to confuse children.
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:14.960]  They want their essence. They want their soul.
[1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:17.960]  They want their spirit. They want their power
[1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:19.960]  because they are our future.
[1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:21.960]  And this Christmas, remember,
[1:31:21.960 --> 1:31:23.960]  it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:25.960]  It is about the West.
[1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:29.960]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:31.960]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:34.960]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family,
[1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:37.960]  to pray for America, to pray for President Trump,
[1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:39.960]  and to pray for InfoWars.
[1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:42.960]  And to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:44.960]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:48.960]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:50.960]  I know you've been taking action. I salute you.
[1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.960]  But just remember, I know you're humble.
[1:31:52.960 --> 1:31:57.960]  But just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:02.960]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government,
[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:06.960]  the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:08.960]  We've been proven dead on.
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:12.960]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:14.960]  You've been the men and women of the arena.
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:16.960]  I really do thank you and salute you.
[1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:18.960]  All words are not enough.
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:22.960]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies
[1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:26.960]  that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:30.960]  an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:34.960]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:36.960]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:41.960]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:44.960]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:46.960]  to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:49.960]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack
[1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:51.960]  and we just need you to go to infowars.com
[1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:54.960]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:33:18.960]  and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:50.960]  I was just talking to Gavin McGinnis.
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:56.960]  I found her a vice, famous comedian.
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.960]  I guess they call him a male chauvinist because she doesn't admit her inherent bad.
[1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:04.960]  There are women inherently bad, like the leftists tell us.
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:06.960]  He's against all the race-baiting.
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:09.960]  Kind of like a white Martin Luther King, I mean.
[1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:12.960]  You stand for what people actually do, not what color they are.
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.960]  So that's why you're the horrible racist because the left has gone pure racist, pure brainwashing.
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:20.960]  And called her, they want her fired now, that's up on infowars.com.
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:23.960]  Because she's saying the left has turned into people that hate white males.
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:25.960]  Well, that's their whole religion.
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  This is their whole program.
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:30.960]  That's a bunch of old billionaire white males manipulating it all.
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:32.960]  But you during the break, I said, what do you want to hit next?
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:36.960]  You said, I want to make it clear and go back to the date when it happened.
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:38.960]  Let's pull up some of the other videos, not just the fight scene,
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:43.960]  because recap this because they're using this as a model
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:49.960]  to demonize any conservatives standing up to Antifa that's supposed to be the new street army
[1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:53.960]  of the left to take this country over, which they do use in blue cities,
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:57.960]  where the police stand down and they can commit any crime they want.
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:34:59.960]  You want to reiterate that this was staged.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:01.960]  They were waiting.
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:06.960]  But my friend, we got documents in January of this year, 11 months ago.
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:10.960]  And it's been confirmed by a gentleman whose brother was in Antifa.
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:13.960]  His brother got in trouble and he went in there and he was he has battle commands
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:16.960]  from George Soros, Jr. Alexander Soros.
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:20.960]  They describe how they work with the police, the areas they stage the events,
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:24.960]  how they're trying to get black Americans to riot so they can bring martial law in.
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:25.960]  We have all these documents.
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:30.960]  Anybody can type it in documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:31.960]  And you read these.
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:32.960]  These are real documents.
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:33.960]  This is what they do.
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:35.960]  So they're working with the cities.
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:36.960]  They're in just like Portland.
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:37.960]  So please continue.
[1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:41.960]  Okay, so the first clue something fishy is when I told you that poor old lady
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:44.960]  at the Manhattan Republican Club was getting calls not from Manhattan,
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:46.960]  but from all over the country.
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:51.960]  And this is right when a thing called jobs, not mobs was a big hashtag.
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:54.960]  And the left was being known as unhinged and violent.
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:57.960]  And the election was coming up and they needed proof that no,
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:35:59.960]  no, the right are the violent ones.
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:03.960]  We're not the crazy ones because they were in trouble with Maxine Waters saying harass people
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:07.960]  and Hillary saying we are not civil and holders saying when they're down,
[1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:08.960]  we kick them.
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:12.960]  They had a bad rep and they desperately needed some bad right wing.
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:15.960]  We're going to harass them at the gas station, the mall, restaurants.
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:17.960]  Don't let, run them out of there.
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:19.960]  That was bad for the election.
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:20.960]  So they needed something.
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:25.960]  And they, the Antifa who were there were not just brawling.
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:27.960]  They were determined to get a fight.
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:30.960]  Like when they were dispersed, they went around the block and came back.
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:33.960]  Someone somewhere said, we need violence from these guys.
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:36.960]  And then they got it and it was normal self-defense.
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:38.960]  And the cops said, well, I don't know what to do here.
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:39.960]  You said you don't want to press charges.
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:40.960]  Doesn't seem like a bunch of a case.
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:43.960]  It's only a 10 second brawl that you guys started.
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:48.960]  And then, almost instantaneously, we see de Blasio say,
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:51.960]  oh, there's a hate group roaming the streets of New York.
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:57.960]  The attorney general said that we don't tolerate hate groups beating up random people.
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:01.960]  Governor Cuomo says he wants to fight me.
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:03.960]  He goes, hey, Gavin, I'm a boy from Queens.
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:04.960]  You want to mess with us?
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:06.960]  We don't tolerate hate groups.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:07.960]  Bang, bang, bang.
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:10.960]  They all came out almost instantly after all of this.
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:13.960]  And then these guys see their charges and they're like,
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:16.960]  what the hell felony riot for defending myself?
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:17.960]  This was a setup.
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:20.960]  But this is just like England where literally,
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.960]  remember the gypsies robbed the people's house three times?
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:25.960]  They beat the guy's wife up.
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  Well, the next time he gets an old, ancient shotgun, shoots one of them.
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:30.960]  The guy doesn't get killed.
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:33.960]  That guy, like 30 years in prison, the gypsies, nothing.
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:36.960]  And you see the articles all the time where the father catches the Muslim.
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:39.960]  This was this week raping his nine-year-old daughter.
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:40.960]  He fights him off.
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:44.960]  He's going to jail because they want you to learn you're going to lay down.
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:47.960]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:50.960]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:51.960]  They say they don't want police.
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:52.960]  It's not the police are perfect.
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:56.960]  It's that the globalists just want to have disorder so they can be violent against us
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:37:58.960]  and then take control of the police.
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:01.960]  They want blue city police where the literally,
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:03.960]  it's in the documents, they're working with them.
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:05.960]  No, I talk to cops all the time.
[1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:07.960]  The cops are down here with us.
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:08.960]  The cops are proud boys.
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:11.960]  No, but I mean in blue cities though, the left is in command.
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:12.960]  Right.
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:14.960]  And then like at Berkeley, they tell the cops,
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.960]  you may not defend these people.
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.960]  Like at Milo, the cops were told to stand down.
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:21.960]  Jesse Aguero, whatever his name is, told the cops to stand down
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:22.960]  because he wanted cash.
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.960]  So I don't blame cops in any of this.
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:26.960]  No, I agree, but it's just like Charlottesville.
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:28.960]  The police are ordered to stand down.
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:30.960]  They're ordered to herd the people through the whole crowds.
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:31.960]  They get an attack going.
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:32.960]  Yes.
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:34.960]  And you know, the more people I talk to,
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:37.960]  like when the lawyers told me I should stand down, it might help,
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:40.960]  I go, but wait a minute, like what the hell is attempted assault?
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:42.960]  What are all these weird charges I'm hearing?
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:44.960]  And they go, this case became politicized
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:47.960]  and it's not following any of the rules.
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:49.960]  This normally would be a silly misdemeanor probation.
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:52.960]  And you know the craziest part of all this?
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:55.960]  They, all these guys, nine guys now facing felony charges
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:58.960]  under some made up story about racism.
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:01.960]  Two of them have black wives and black kids
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:04.960]  and they're now unemployed and living back with their parents
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:06.960]  because they're racist.
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.960]  But we can always prove that that's not even the case.
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:11.960]  The point is the left is using race-based politics
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:13.960]  as divide and conquer programs.
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:16.960]  And so, Gavin, I know you want to help the Prad boys.
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:17.960]  They're heroes.
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:18.960]  They're in a war.
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:20.960]  You've been persecuted for telling the truth.
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:21.960]  I've been persecuted.
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:22.960]  They're being persecuted.
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:24.960]  I'm telling you how this stuff works.
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:26.960]  They get you all scared,
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:28.960]  and then they get you to plea bargain
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:30.960]  and they get you to do all this stuff.
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.960]  Like, how is it going to sentencing?
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:34.960]  They haven't had a jury trial, have they?
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:35.960]  No, not yet.
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:36.960]  There was one yesterday.
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:38.960]  It's just been appearances so far.
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:40.960]  So you're saying sentencing today, though?
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:41.960]  No.
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:43.960]  It was just, I forget what it's called, like your appearance.
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:44.960]  Arrainment.
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:45.960]  Arrainment, yeah.
[1:39:45.960 --> 1:39:46.960]  Well, here's the deal.
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:49.960]  When you say, I got physically attacked, I defend yourself.
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:51.960]  Let's go to that jury.
[1:39:51.960 --> 1:39:54.960]  But instead, how these corrupt jurisdictions work is
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:56.960]  they come in and they stare the hell out of you,
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:00.960]  and they say, listen, you're going to lose these lawsuits
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:03.960]  unless you just go ahead and go meet with the Democrats.
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:04.960]  But they might.
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:06.960]  I mean, a jury in New York City is going to see
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:09.960]  Alt-Right Hate Group, and they're going to go
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:10.960]  throw the book at them.
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:11.960]  You know what?
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:12.960]  It'll get killed on appeal.
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:14.960]  But I'm telling you, here's the deal.
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.960]  They get you to do what they want.
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:17.960]  Yeah, but you're not listening to me.
[1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:19.960]  I've been through this longer than you have.
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:22.960]  I'm just telling you, they're going to burn your guys down.
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:24.960]  And I'm not saying you're bad.
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:25.960]  You didn't know.
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:27.960]  They get you to kind of agree to a bunch of stuff
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:29.960]  to get your leader to stand down, to make it sound
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:32.960]  like you've done something wrong, to have the leader to cry at,
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:33.960]  like, oh, they're cut away.
[1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:34.960]  They've done something bad.
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:36.960]  And then, oh, this guy was taken off the air,
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:39.960]  and you're just thinking, oh, I'm talking to the prosecutors,
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:41.960]  and my lawyers are, they're going to be reasonable.
[1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:42.960]  No, they're not reasonable.
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:43.960]  They're Democrat criminals.
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:44.960]  I agree.
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:46.960]  We lost is what I'm saying, though.
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:48.960]  Before, it was just like the mods and the rockers,
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:50.960]  and it was just two groups fighting.
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.960]  Then they put my friends in prison.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  No, no, but look at, I'm not, I'm not trying.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:56.960]  $35,000 in lawyer fees.
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:59.960]  Gavin, I'm not trying to make points with you.
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:01.960]  You're a smart guy.
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:02.960]  I've been through this.
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:05.960]  I learned, you know, I had them, like, three years ago,
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:07.960]  just say, say you're sorry to Sandy Hook parents,
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:09.960]  because I figured out that I thought it happened.
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:11.960]  You know, they thought about babies and incubators
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:12.960]  in Iraq war and all sort of fake stuff.
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:13.960]  I never created a thing questioning it.
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:15.960]  I think people have a right to question anything they want.
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:17.960]  But I looked at it and I said, you know, I think it happened,
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:19.960]  because some of the evidence people brought up turned out
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:20.960]  to not be accurate.
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:21.960]  Wolf King halbing people.
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:22.960]  I'm not against Wolf King either.
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:24.960]  I just had debates with Wolf King and said, no,
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:27.960]  I think there's some people getting told PR stuff later.
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:28.960]  That's what looks like acting.
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:30.960]  But I said, I think this happened.
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:32.960]  Holy mackerel, dude.
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:35.960]  When I said, I just said, just say you're sorry.
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:36.960]  You thought it happened.
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:37.960]  I said that.
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:40.960]  It's in penthouse this month.
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:41.960]  It's all over the news.
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:43.960]  The Jones won't say he's sorry.
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:46.960]  He's sending people to their houses right now to bully
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:47.960]  and attack them.
[1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:49.960]  And then they put the people on TV lying,
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:51.960]  saying I'm currently doing that when I never did it.
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:53.960]  I just learned that that's what the left does.
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:56.960]  They come to you and they tell you, oh, just be reasonable.
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:57.960]  We have humanity.
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:41:59.960]  And it's all a setup.
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:01.960]  It's all a setup, man.
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:03.960]  And it's not the families I blame.
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:06.960]  It's these lawyers and these prosecutors because they've
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:08.960]  learned how to use our humanity to manipulate us.
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:10.960]  You guys are heroes.
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:11.960]  You're a hero.
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:14.960]  The proud boys have never gotten arrested anywhere.
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:18.960]  They get attacked by methad professors and in city employees
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:19.960]  and black outfits.
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:20.960]  They fight back.
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:21.960]  They violently kick their ass.
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:22.960]  You're heroes.
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:23.960]  So you have to be demonized.
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:26.960]  Instead, you have to take on you're a hero like George Washington.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:28.960]  You have to take it on the persecution.
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:31.960]  And you have to never then think that they're actually
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  trying to compromise.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:35.960]  They want you destroyed.
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:37.960]  Because you are not a pedophile.
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:38.960]  They were successful.
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.960]  I'm destroyed.
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:44.960]  They won.
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:45.960]  Yeah, we'll see about that.
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:47.960]  We can rebuild it bigger than it was before.
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:50.960]  Stronger, faster.
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:52.960]  I can't just extend on, man.
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:56.960]  I'm Stephen Hawking.

[1:43:56.960 --> 1:43:59.960]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:02.960]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:04.960]  And then I came up with the idea last week,
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:06.960]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide,
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:09.960]  50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:15.960]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:19.960]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, 4 to 5 super blue,
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:24.960]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:26.960]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt,
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:28.960]  but these are going to be selling out.
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:31.960]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:33.960]  that's there until it sells out,
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:35.960]  and then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:40.960]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:43.960]  So this is a loss-leader. We are losing money on this.
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:45.960]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:47.960]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything,
[1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:49.960]  and don't fight the crowds.
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:53.960]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple-8253-3139.

[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:23.960]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:28.960]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:36.960]  organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:40.960]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:46.960]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:50.960]  throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:56.960]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:25.960]  The listeners and viewers have to be committed.
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:53.960]  We are our strength.
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:48:22.960]  We are our strength.
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:48.960]  We are our strength.
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:55.960]  Steve Austin, astronaut. A man barely alive.
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:01.960]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology.
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:09.960]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:22.960]  Steve Austin will be that man, better than he was before, better, stronger, faster.
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:27.960]  Listen, they know you have humanities,
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:29.960]  so they're ready to sign up and put your friends in prison.
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:31.960]  You guys made some mistakes.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:33.960]  I didn't want to be a control freak in your business.
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:35.960]  What were the mistakes you made?
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:41.960]  Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:44.960]  Listen to me. You're 48, I'm 45.
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:46.960]  You know more than I do about a lot of things.
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:48.960]  We talked about our kids last night for three hours.
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:50.960]  Women, all of them.
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:53.960]  It's that I've already been higher up the mountain
[1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:55.960]  and been to the same attacks.
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:49:57.960]  It's all wrote. It's all blueprints.
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:00.960]  So I'm telling you, I used to be like you,
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:03.960]  and I thought, oh, I'll signal this, I'll be nice.
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:05.960]  They take that as blood and they attack.
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:07.960]  It's like Stone's rules.
[1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:11.960]  The point is they take everything you do and they turn it against you
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:13.960]  and they lie and you have to understand that.
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:16.960]  So you're bummed out that people came to your event
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:18.960]  and a bunch of government organized by the New York City
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:20.960]  and the Democrats came to attack.
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:22.960]  They're putting them in prison. That's on them.
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:25.960]  That's more reason for men to go out in public and stand up to them.
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:27.960]  That's more reason to get more aggressive.
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:30.960]  Not less of a reason that we know we're dealing with bad people.
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:32.960]  That's why you did this. You've been proven right.
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:34.960]  So you're now entering the epic level.
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:37.960]  Man, this is a war. People go fight and die in foreign countries.
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.960]  It's usually for some globalist cause.
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:43.960]  We're here in America fighting people that say the nation can't exist.
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:45.960]  No borders, no walls, no U.S. at all.
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:48.960]  That's the Democratic Party, Governor Cuomo that's persecuting you
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:51.960]  and your people. He says, America was never great.
[1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:54.960]  It'll never be great. These people are the enemy.
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:57.960]  So it's a horrible criminal group going after you.
[1:50:57.960 --> 1:50:59.960]  They're going after you, baby,
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:02.960]  because you're on the front lines kicking their ass.
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:05.960]  You have to embrace that attack.
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:07.960]  You have to tell the people you need their support.
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:09.960]  He's been talking about walking away.
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:11.960]  Not just on air. This is real. He's talking about walking away.
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:13.960]  They've been harassing his wife. He doesn't want to get into it on air.
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:15.960]  They've been doing horrible psyops.
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.960]  And brother, you got to just give it all to God and say,
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.960]  if I lose everything, it doesn't matter and commit.
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:24.960]  And then it'll be like all the fear everything leaves
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.960]  and it's like crystal clear.
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:28.960]  And now you're on a whole another plateau.
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:30.960]  You have to cross that river.
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:32.960]  You have to cross the Red Sea.
[1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:34.960]  I remember Tommy Robinson said that to me once.
[1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:36.960]  He said, I used to be scared of being killed.
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:39.960]  I used to be scared of dying and my kids not having a dad.
[1:51:39.960 --> 1:51:43.960]  And then he said, you reach a level where one day it just clicks
[1:51:43.960 --> 1:51:45.960]  and you go, I might die. I might not,
[1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:47.960]  but I'm just going to keep fighting.
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:50.960]  And he said, the fear just washed away from him.
[1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:52.960]  Now you're Lee Rogers.
[1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:54.960]  That's what I'm telling you.
[1:51:54.960 --> 1:51:59.960]  I'm telling you, because I used to just like,
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:01.960]  they think when they mess with me,
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:02.960]  it's to me, it's the opposite now.
[1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.960]  It's not that I'm a sadist or a sadomasochist.
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:09.960]  I don't like it, but it's what men are supposed to do.
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:11.960]  This is just basic stuff.
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:12.960]  Yeah, standing up for yourself.
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:14.960]  I understand, but I also...
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:16.960]  No, you can't believe how corrupt they are.
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:19.960]  You can't believe how they lie and you can't believe deep down.
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:20.960]  You don't feel sorry for yourself.
[1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:23.960]  You can't believe America is putting up with this crap.
[1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:27.960]  I have a few TV stations calling me in radio stations.
[1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:31.960]  They go, will you please not show or play three-year-olds
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:34.960]  putting money in G-strings of fat men wearing wigs,
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:35.960]  shaking their asses?
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:38.960]  And I go, okay, I'll quit for you,
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:40.960]  but you understand this is being shown to children.
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:42.960]  Adults need to know what the hell's going on.
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:44.960]  They go, okay, actually you're right,
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:45.960]  but well, people complain.
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:47.960]  I go, I know they need to complain.
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:51.960]  They should complain about the children being asked with.
[1:52:51.960 --> 1:52:55.960]  God, not me showing you.
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:57.960]  You think I like seeing this crap?
[1:52:57.960 --> 1:53:02.960]  You think it doesn't piss me off?
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:04.960]  Let me tell you, I'm ready to kill people.
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:07.960]  I'm sick of this, not literally.
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:12.960]  The point is, I'm getting sick of this crap.
[1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:13.960]  That's one attitude.
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:14.960]  Another attitude is...
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:16.960]  Let's just give all our kids and the child molesters.
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:17.960]  God damn it.
[1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:18.960]  Excuse me.
[1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:21.960]  You know, I'm not taking Lord's name in vain.
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:22.960]  I want these people damned to hell.
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:24.960]  I'm literally praying, God damn them to hell.
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:25.960]  That's not the Lord's name in vain.
[1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:26.960]  I mean that.
[1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:28.960]  I don't take God in vain.
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:31.960]  We ought to have a prayer called the God damn it prayer.
[1:53:31.960 --> 1:53:34.960]  God damn them to hell, please.
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:36.960]  You think Charlton has seen the plan of the eggs
[1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:38.960]  when he realizes this is earth,
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:40.960]  and all his family died 10,000 years before
[1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:42.960]  and he's come back through a wormhole,
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:43.960]  and everybody he knows is dead,
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:45.960]  and he's saying, God damn them to hell.
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:47.960]  You bastards, you blew it all up.
[1:53:47.960 --> 1:53:49.960]  God damn you.
[1:53:49.960 --> 1:53:51.960]  He's not taking Lord's name in vain.
[1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:53.960]  He's saying, God damn them.
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:55.960]  God damn them.
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:53:57.960]  God damn them.
[1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:01.960]  God fucking damn them to hell.
[1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:03.960]  You seem upset.
[1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:05.960]  I'm freaking pissed, man.
[1:54:05.960 --> 1:54:07.960]  You know they're giving kids vaccines everywhere
[1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:10.960]  that eat their freaking cerebral cortex.
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:13.960]  No, I'm not really familiar with vaccines.
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:15.960]  But here's another attitude.
[1:54:15.960 --> 1:54:17.960]  There's two Americas now.
[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:19.960]  There's no more cohesion.
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:21.960]  You have to make sure that your family is safe,
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:23.960]  that you have enough money to make sure
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:25.960]  your kids don't get brainwashed,
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:28.960]  and we are living in plan of the apes.
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:31.960]  I think we've gone past the point of no return.
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:34.960]  So you make sure your kid isn't at that event.
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:37.960]  If I went to a strip bar and little kids were giving a woman money,
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:39.960]  I'd want to kick somebody's butt.
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:41.960]  Yeah, kids are not sexual beings.
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:43.960]  Why are we talking about their sex lives all the time,
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:45.960]  like drag kids and all this stuff?
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:47.960]  Why are we sexualizing our children
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:50.960]  and making them choose genders?
[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:52.960]  Oh, I had a huge epiphany.
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.960]  My grandmother, when I would see something really horrible,
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:55.960]  I'd say, Jesus.
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:54:57.960]  She'd say, don't take Lord Norman Fain.
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:54:59.960]  That's some weird brainwash Baptist thing.
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:00.960]  I love God.
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:02.960]  I'm involuntarily calling on Jesus
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:04.960]  when I see them sexually brainwashing children.
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:07.960]  I'm saying, Jesus, save us.
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:09.960]  You need to call on Jesus, Gavin.
[1:55:09.960 --> 1:55:12.960]  I've been doing a lot of praying past months.
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:13.960]  You want to pray with me right now?
[1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:14.960]  Sure.
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:15.960]  We come back from reckless to it.
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:16.960]  I get into a rage.
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:18.960]  I apologize.
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:19.960]  But I really don't.
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:20.960]  I got to plug Ringo Bankrupt.
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:23.960]  The enemy is totally trying to shut us down.
[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:25.960]  The enemy, all they ever say is we're not real
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:26.960]  because they know damn well we're real.
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:29.960]  100%, 100% folks, I'm ready.
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:32.960]  I'm trying to figure out how to beat these people every damn second
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:34.960]  because my very cells cry out against them.
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:38.960]  My very spirit is just on fire to defeat these people.
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:40.960]  And I want to spread the fire of liberty in your mind
[1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:41.960]  and others' minds.
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:42.960]  It's not my fire.
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:43.960]  It's God's fire.
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:45.960]  And you, let me tell you something.
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:46.960]  You ask Christ in your heart.
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:48.960]  Not the fake devil you get at these churches,
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:49.960]  but the real Christ.
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:50.960]  You'll be on fire as well.
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:51.960]  And it's not a God of weakness.
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:55.960]  It's a God of strength and of overcoming these people.
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:57.960]  And I need your financial support so I can expand
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.960]  and support others in the work they're going to do.
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:02.960]  And quite frankly, the deals we have are so good.
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:03.960]  We're losing money on a lot of these.
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:04.960]  But I'm clearing my whole warehouse out.
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:07.960]  Free t-shirt with every order, 50%, 75% off,
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:10.960]  double patriot points, and so much more
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:11.960]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:12.960]  It is insane.
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:14.960]  Air filtration, water filtration,
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:17.960]  60% off all super blue fluoride free,
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:20.960]  colloidal silver iodine fortified systems.
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:22.960]  They're about to sell out Alexa Pure Breeze.
[1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:26.960]  They sold us at cost, incredible four-stage ion filter system.
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:28.960]  The competitors are 600 bucks, 500 bucks.
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:29.960]  They're a great deal at 240.
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:31.960]  They're at 127 right now.
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:33.960]  I'm doing that as a favor to them.
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:36.960]  infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com,
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:40.960]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:43.960]  That's triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:45.960]  And Gavin, you're such a good guy.
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:47.960]  You're not even here on air with a website
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:49.960]  or they wouldn't let you have a go fund me or whatever.
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:50.960]  But I'm going to try to hopefully,
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:52.960]  if you want to work with a sponsorship or something, whatever.
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:55.960]  The point is, you need to get back on that horse.
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:57.960]  And you need to take care of your wife for a few weeks.
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:56:58.960]  I know they're harassing the hell out of you.
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:56:59.960]  You told me probably what's happening.
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:00.960]  Maybe you'll tell them publicly.
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:03.960]  But then that just makes them go after more and just do what you
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:06.960]  know, Tucker Carlson, as we all know, has moved to a place
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:08.960]  I won't say where and the harassment's been unbelievable there
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:10.960]  and everybody else, I get it.
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:13.960]  But if Tucker's mainstream, he's not a radical guy.
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:15.960]  Remember, we had dinner with him a couple of nights ago.
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:16.960]  Is that classified information?
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:19.960]  No, but let's talk about it when we come back.
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:20.960]  Okay.
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:22.960]  Gavin, your YouTube's still up for now.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:23.960]  Tell people how they find that.
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:24.960]  And they should all go subscribe.
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:26.960]  So you can then contact them once you get a website.
[1:57:26.960 --> 1:57:30.960]  I promise you, my YouTube will be down within the week.
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:33.960]  Guaranteed. I'm stunned it came back.
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:35.960]  Because the reason it was called fraud, we'll explain that fraud
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:36.960]  when we come back.
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:37.960]  It's all bigger than Gavin McGinnis.
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:38.960]  It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:39.960]  It's bigger than all of us.
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:40.960]  It's the universe.
[1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:41.960]  It's God.
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:42.960]  It's the devil.
[1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:43.960]  It's your soul.
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:44.960]  It's your destiny.
[1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:45.960]  It's your free will.
[1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:46.960]  Make the right decision.
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:47.960]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:49.960]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:52.960]  to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:54.960]  or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:57.960]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:00.960]  and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:04.960]  But thanks to SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com,
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:06.960]  I still have that energy.
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:09.960]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day
[1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:12.960]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:14.960]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle
[1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:16.960]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:20.960]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:22.960]  to get to the gym, get to the park
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:26.960]  and get exercise that you need for your health.
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:29.960]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SupermailVitality
[1:58:29.960 --> 1:58:30.960]  before it's gone.

[1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:40.960]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:43.960]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again
[1:59:43.960 --> 1:59:45.960]  for making the entire Infowars possible.
[1:59:45.960 --> 1:59:55.960]  And again, you are the resistance.
[2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:27.960]  All right, Gavin.
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:30.960]  I want to give the number out coming up about 15 minutes.
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:32.960]  I want to take phone calls with you, but I've been ranting.
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:33.960]  I want to give you the floor.
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:35.960]  Let's get off how they're persecuting you
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:37.960]  and how they're just in general kind of a bunch of thugs
[2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:40.960]  and bullies and those ridiculous Google hearings
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:42.960]  that we just had on Tuesday
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:45.960]  that our team had a great job covering.
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:49.960]  And let's just say I enjoyed getting Sundar's face
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:52.960]  on authoritarian monster.
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:55.960]  And Google's headquarters burst in flames the next day.
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:00:58.960]  I was very upset about that.
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:01.960]  You know, there's a major rebellion inside all the tech companies.
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:02.960]  I've heard about that.
[2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:04.960]  Yeah, because they can't all be left wing.
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:05.960]  Not all nerds are beta.
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:08.960]  Actually, it's the real liberals that are classic liberals.
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:09.960]  Oh, wow.
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:11.960]  They're the ones that are not leftist liberals.
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:12.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:14.960]  They're like, what the hell?
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:17.960]  And they know conservatives are really nice people.
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:20.960]  You know, you've got to check out the Wikipedia for Proud Boys.
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:23.960]  It's been totally infiltrated with this Antifa groups.
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:24.960]  And it says Antifa.
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:26.960]  That's part of their profile.
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:30.960]  And it goes off about how we were very worried about white men
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:33.960]  and racism and white supremacy.
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:37.960]  And it's the least factual Wikipedia I've ever seen.
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:40.960]  They're worried about the dead men, especially white men.
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  What does a dictionary get to say, especially white men?
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:45.960]  Well, let's be clear.
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:48.960]  They let the quote Antifa, a known terror organization,
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:49.960]  actually listed as one.
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:51.960]  They lie and say, you are wasn't even true.
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:53.960]  And then they get to sit there and edit it, but you don't.
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:54.960]  Yes.
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:56.960]  Antifa is not just on the streets.
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:57.960]  They are all over Wikipedia.
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:01:59.960]  They've totally taken over that site.
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:00.960]  Let's talk about the profile.
[2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:03.960]  And then the New York Post, they're in mainstream news places.
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:04.960]  CNN depends on MSNBC.
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:05.960]  Yeah.
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:06.960]  They are the paramilitary brigade.
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:07.960]  We'll get to that next segment.
[2:02:07.960 --> 2:02:09.960]  But let's talk about this.
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:13.960]  What is the profile of your average Antifa general
[2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:16.960]  down to the mentally ill method?
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:17.960]  It depends on the city.
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:20.960]  In New York, they are rich kid academics
[2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:23.960]  who are doing their PhD, their dissertation,
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:25.960]  and they read about Marx all day.
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:27.960]  And they're jealous of these communists.
[2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:30.960]  And they get a lot of poontang
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:32.960]  because women see it as a rebel.
[2:02:32.960 --> 2:02:33.960]  Yeah.
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:34.960]  I'm fighting for justice.
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:36.960]  I'm the freedom rider from the 60s.
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:39.960]  But you have other places like Berkeley
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:42.960]  where a lot of these poor bastards are homeless kids
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:45.960]  who were taken in by Yvette Falarka types.
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:46.960]  And they stay at these homes
[2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:48.960]  that I think are linked to globalists.
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:52.960]  And they feel beholden to the people who took them in.
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:55.960]  And they're begging for change that day.
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:02:56.960]  They are quartered,
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:02:59.960]  they are quartered little paramilitary groups.
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:01.960]  Yes, like domesticated animals.
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:03.960]  Because I've been around their low level one
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:06.960]  where they're all like meth head, milly retarded,
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:07.960]  kind of semi-autistic.
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:09.960]  Yeah, that's Berkeley and Portland.
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:10.960]  They have a lot of homeless losers.
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:12.960]  And by the way, another big thing in Antifa
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:15.960]  no one ever talks about is the sexual perversions.
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:17.960]  When you look at their Twitter feed, when you find them.
[2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:19.960]  Oh, it's like dude's dressed as a woman with a machine gun.
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:20.960]  Yes, yes.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:22.960]  And they follow these tranny...
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:24.960]  Type in Antifa losers and click images.
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:25.960]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:26.960]  It is bizarre.
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:27.960]  And you realize, wait a minute,
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:28.960]  like there was that guy Mika Rhodes
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:31.960]  who was just arrested for raping several...
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:32.960]  There's this guy too.
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:33.960]  He's a commando.
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:34.960]  He's like one of the main leaders.
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:35.960]  That's the guy that sent the people
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:36.960]  to Tucker Carlson's house.
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:37.960]  Yep, yep.
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:39.960]  Michael Isaacson, I think his name is.
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:40.960]  No human.
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:41.960]  No human.
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:42.960]  Tez dispenser.
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:43.960]  No borders.
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:44.960]  No wall.
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:45.960]  No USA at all.
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:46.960]  No USA at all?
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:47.960]  What's here?
[2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:48.960]  Do we have a flag?
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:49.960]  I would say though, he's got...
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:50.960]  I mean, my neck's only 20 inches solid muscle.
[2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:51.960]  That guy's got a powerful neck.
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:53.960]  He could probably take a hammer blow.
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:54.960]  He's malicious.
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:57.960]  They're a dangerous bunch, but...
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:03:59.960]  But yeah, they...
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:00.960]  I think like Mika Rhodes, sorry.
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:02.960]  So he was just arrested.
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:05.960]  He was raping underage men and women, couples.
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:07.960]  Mika Rhodes, the head of Portland and Tifa.
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:12.960]  And you realize, oh, this group is trying to destroy
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:15.960]  traditionalism because they're sexual perverts.
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:16.960]  The criminals.
[2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:18.960]  And like Luke Coon was one of the guys
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:20.960]  that Project Very Test caught talking about
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:22.960]  bombing Deplora Ball and gassing it.
[2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:24.960]  And then we see that he writes fan fiction
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:26.960]  about sexualizing 10-year-old boys.
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:28.960]  And you realize you're all sexual...
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:30.960]  Who's the other liberal that got caught
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:32.960]  watching tentacle porn?
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:35.960]  Oh yeah, was that the bald guy?
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:37.960]  What?
[2:04:37.960 --> 2:04:38.960]  What was his name?
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:39.960]  By the way, Kurt Eichenwone.
[2:04:39.960 --> 2:04:41.960]  Yeah, it's all totally insane.
[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.960]  And we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:45.960]  infowars.com, newswars.com.
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:47.960]  Hopefully Gavin will have a website
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:48.960]  and we'll get back on the horse.
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:49.960]  Gavin...
[2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:51.960]  I want to push the Broadway fundraiser please.
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:53.960]  I'm gonna kick your ass if you don't get back on air.
[2:04:53.960 --> 2:04:55.960]  Let's just have a fight when we come back.
[2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:56.960]  In the last few months,
[2:04:56.960 --> 2:04:58.960]  infowars has been escalating our sales
[2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:00.960]  to clear out inventory
[2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:01.960]  of many of our best-selling items.
[2:05:01.960 --> 2:05:03.960]  And then I came up with the idea last week,
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:05.960]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide,
[2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:08.960]  50 to 75% off double-patreon points.
[2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:11.960]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[2:05:11.960 --> 2:05:14.960]  a free gift with every order.
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.960]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free,
[2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:18.960]  colloidal silver iodine, 4 to 5 super blue,
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:22.960]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:23.960]  while supplies last.
[2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:24.960]  And what I mean by that is,
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:25.960]  everyone will get a t-shirt,
[2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:27.960]  but these are gonna be selling out.
[2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:29.960]  So whatever you order that day,
[2:05:29.960 --> 2:05:31.960]  there'll be the shirt of the day
[2:05:31.960 --> 2:05:32.960]  that's there until it sells out.
[2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:33.960]  And then there'll be another shirt
[2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:35.960]  that goes up for the next group of orders.
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:36.960]  So in the next 12 days,
[2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:38.960]  we are going to have beyond
[2:05:38.960 --> 2:05:40.960]  any other sale we've ever had.
[2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:41.960]  So this is a loss-leader.
[2:05:41.960 --> 2:05:43.960]  We are losing money on this.
[2:05:43.960 --> 2:05:44.960]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:45.960]  Get your free gift,
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:46.960]  your free shipping, everything.
[2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:48.960]  And don't fight the crowds.
[2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:49.960]  infowarsstore.com,
[2:05:49.960 --> 2:05:50.960]  infowarslife.com,
[2:05:50.960 --> 2:05:53.960]  or triple-8253-3139.
[2:05:53.960 --> 2:05:55.960]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:26.960]  Gavan McGuinness is our guest.
[2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:28.960]  Well, there's a lot of big breaking news
[2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:30.960]  at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:32.960]  There's so many other big issues,
[2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:33.960]  but I gotta say something right now.
[2:06:33.960 --> 2:06:34.960]  I don't just be honest, everybody.
[2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:35.960]  Point blank.
[2:06:35.960 --> 2:06:38.960]  If America can't beat the Democratic Party
[2:06:38.960 --> 2:06:40.960]  and their leader Hillary Clinton,
[2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:41.960]  who is still in control of it,
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:43.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:44.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:45.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:46.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:47.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:48.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:49.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:50.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:51.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:51.960 --> 2:06:52.960]  I don't just have to.
[2:06:52.960 --> 2:06:54.960]  I don't just have internal emails that are out there.
[2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:57.960]  I have the people that literally guard her,
[2:06:57.960 --> 2:06:59.960]  repeatedly came to see me,
[2:06:59.960 --> 2:07:00.960]  and they said,
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:01.960]  this is going to happen.
[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:02.960]  That's going to happen.
[2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:03.960]  We want you to say this on air.
[2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:04.960]  And I didn't say it,
[2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:05.960]  so more people came and told me.
[2:07:05.960 --> 2:07:06.960]  And then sure enough,
[2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:07.960]  it got announced that Hillary
[2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:08.960]  still plans to run for president.
[2:07:08.960 --> 2:07:09.960]  People think this is crazy.
[2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:10.960]  She's doing it.
[2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:12.960]  If we can't defeat her politically
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:14.960]  in a bunch of method antifa,
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:16.960]  and this latest footage in Portland
[2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:18.960]  that was exclusive to infowars.com,
[2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:21.960]  a shock video, antifa terrorizes local
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:23.960]  Portland residents protesting mayor,
[2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:25.960]  hits them with clubs, eggs, everything.
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:26.960]  And the police let them do it.
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:28.960]  They were patches that show a Christian cross
[2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:30.960]  with a slash through it.
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:34.960]  I mean, these are the scum of the earth.
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:36.960]  And this is what the Democrats
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:38.960]  and Nancy Pelosi have defended.
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:42.960]  And these are groups that praise murder of cops.
[2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:45.960]  And, you know, I've not been anti-police.
[2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:46.960]  I'm anti-authoritarianism.
[2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:47.960]  I've gotten on bad cops before.
[2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:49.960]  But if the police and their unions
[2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:51.960]  and other people don't organize
[2:07:51.960 --> 2:07:54.960]  and your blue cities and stop putting up with this crap,
[2:07:54.960 --> 2:07:55.960]  you are aiding and abetting
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:57.960]  and are now part of the problem.
[2:07:57.960 --> 2:07:59.960]  And I'm about to get pissed.
[2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:02.960]  Here in Austin, every cop I run to is a great guy.
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:04.960]  Hispanic, black, they're all white.
[2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:05.960]  They're all great people.
[2:08:05.960 --> 2:08:06.960]  Smart people.
[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:08.960]  I was sure I tried to go down for that young lady
[2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:11.960]  that got shot in the back by that illegal alien.
[2:08:11.960 --> 2:08:13.960]  And then the grand jury in San Francisco said,
[2:08:13.960 --> 2:08:15.960]  or the jury said, not guilty.
[2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:16.960]  You know, she's white.
[2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:17.960]  She deserves a die.
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:18.960]  She was in the back.
[2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:21.960]  They had assault rifles, you know,
[2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:23.960]  Semi-Auto AK-47s, and said,
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:25.960]  you scared boy and we're hitting him with clubs.
[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:27.960]  He's by himself because he's such a go-getter.
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:29.960]  He's just always out there.
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:30.960]  And he wasn't scared.
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:31.960]  He said, why are you shaking?
[2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:32.960]  Well, I talked to him.
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:33.960]  He's about to attack him.
[2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:35.960]  That's why I can't get around that without security.
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:37.960]  Because if dudes have guns and start bumping me,
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:41.960]  I mean, I'm going to go into King Kong mode.
[2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:43.960]  And I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around,
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:45.960]  but in that mode, it's like, it's dangerous.
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:46.960]  It's dangerous.
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:48.960]  Because I just, I'm gone.
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:50.960]  I'm not thinking, and it's like bad stuff happens.
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:56.960]  And I actually had panic attacks about this.
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:08:57.960]  I can't even watch the video.
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:08:59.960]  Because I'm so proud of him.
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:00.960]  They're hitting him in the side.
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:02.960]  They do that to me, too, when I'm out there.
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:03.960]  I'm on camera.
[2:09:03.960 --> 2:09:04.960]  And they're pointing guns in.
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:05.960]  You scared.
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:07.960]  And the Austin police sit there and take it, man.
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:09.960]  They're sitting there 50 feet away.
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:13.960]  And they let guys with guns literally follow my guy around
[2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:14.960]  and assault him.
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:17.960]  And man, I tell you, it makes me want to throw up.
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:19.960]  It makes me want to move out of this town, too,
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:21.960]  because our infrastructure's here.
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:22.960]  My family's here.
[2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:26.960]  But just to know you live in a lawless criminal city
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:31.960]  where the Democrat City Council members actually canvass
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:34.960]  at the polls at the polling station telling you to vote
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:35.960]  for committing crimes.
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:37.960]  They're just the lawlessness of the tech companies
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:38.960]  and the Democrats.
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:39.960]  They're criminals.
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:40.960]  They're a criminal group.
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:42.960]  It's gotten away with everything.
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:43.960]  Go ahead.
[2:09:43.960 --> 2:09:45.960]  I got this buddy Levi.
[2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:47.960]  And there was a, you know who Yvette Falarka is?
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:49.960]  She runs by any means necessary.
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:50.960]  Bam.
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:51.960]  Yeah.
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.960]  Little Filipino teacher that I think she was arrested recently,
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:54.960]  finally.
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:57.960]  But her and the mayor have this weird relationship that it looks
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:09:58.960]  like they're in cahoots.
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:00.960]  And there was a rally.
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:03.960]  I think it was a, it was Bay Stick Man Milo,
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:05.960]  something like that, some patriot rally.
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:07.960]  And she was standing there and he was joking around.
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:10.960]  And he was on the other side of the petition with the lefties.
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:12.960]  And he's saying, hey, guys, I'm one of you.
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:13.960]  I'm, I'm on this side now.
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:15.960]  I don't like the righties joking around.
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:16.960]  And people were laughing.
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:17.960]  It was totally nonviolent.
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:20.960]  He went a little close to Yvette Falarka,
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:21.960]  just a little close.
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:22.960]  He was about six inches.
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:24.960]  This is not him coming at her.
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:27.960]  This is him making fun of us on the, on the other side going,
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:28.960]  I don't like Trump anymore.
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:29.960]  I like this side.
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:30.960]  He was just being a goof.
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:32.960]  The second he went near her,
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:34.960]  all of a sudden these cops who weren't arresting anyone
[2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:36.960]  exploded into life.
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:38.960]  Just was like, who put a quarter in you?
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:39.960]  Woo.
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:41.960]  And they grab him and they throw him down
[2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:43.960]  and they arrest him and they grind his face.
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:46.960]  Someone somewhere had said that Yvette,
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:48.960]  no one had better go remotely close to her.
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:50.960]  And the cops were definitely told.
[2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:53.960]  So now we have the cops protecting Antifa.
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:55.960]  These same Antifa who were saying,
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:56.960]  what do we want?
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:57.960]  Dead cops.
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:10:58.960]  When do we want them now?
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:00.960]  I mean, how is that for your morale?
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:03.960]  Go protect the people who want you dead.
[2:11:03.960 --> 2:11:05.960]  And give them more rights.
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:07.960]  Well, I've always been worried about state power
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:09.960]  and the globe, the Democrats won't control the police.
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:11.960]  So they have state power.
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:12.960]  So about eight years ago,
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:14.960]  I went from being very critical of the police in many cases.
[2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:15.960]  Not all cases.
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:16.960]  It wasn't against the police themselves.
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:17.960]  Because I always wondered,
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:19.960]  oh, our listeners really like it when I cover bad cops.
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:21.960]  No, Google was pushing it
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:23.960]  because it's part of a larger narrative.
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:24.960]  I figured it out.
[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:27.960]  We were instantly, when we became pro-cop,
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:29.960]  in general, we were demonetized.
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:30.960]  So I went, oh, now I,
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:32.960]  and I'd already read all these history books and God,
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:33.960]  how did I miss that?
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:34.960]  I'm so stupid.
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:35.960]  That was the plan.
[2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:36.960]  And then they start killing cops.
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:38.960]  And I saw CNN and MSNBC say,
[2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:41.960]  well, cops are getting killed because they're being bad.
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:43.960]  So a cop does something wrong in another state.
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:45.960]  Usually that's fake too.
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:47.960]  And then a cop deserves to be shot
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:48.960]  in the back of the head pumping gas
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:51.960]  or changing a tire or whatever.
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:52.960]  And then they're dead.
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:54.960]  And we never even hear their name.
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:56.960]  It's like, oh, if some gangbanger
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:11:58.960]  pulls a gun on cops and they shoot him,
[2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:00.960]  his name is carved in stone.
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:02.960]  And it's not that I'm against black people or anybody.
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:05.960]  They're killing a bunch of black cops in Dallas
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:07.960]  and CNN was like, well, it doesn't matter
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:09.960]  because it's just, it's sick.
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:11.960]  I don't want anybody getting shot in the back of the head.
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:12.960]  They caught, they shot.
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:15.960]  I mean, that pisses, these are dangerous people on TV,
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:18.960]  promoting, shooting police in the back of the head
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:21.960]  and the police kiss their ass.
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:23.960]  God, I'm tired of it.
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:25.960]  You know, there's so, we got the guy.
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:26.960]  This is dangerous.
[2:12:26.960 --> 2:12:27.960]  This is dangerous.
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:29.960]  It is dangerous because you normalize it
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:31.960]  and you have all these commercials about how cops
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:33.960]  are killing people and cops are hunting people.
[2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:35.960]  And so you keep sending that message out.
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:37.960]  And the next thing you know, they go, well,
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:38.960]  I got to defend myself.
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:40.960]  So we had that guy who tweeted out,
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:42.960]  I'm going to make pigs fly tonight.
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:45.960]  And he goes to New York City and he shoots a Hispanic
[2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:48.960]  and an Asian cop in their squad cars.
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:50.960]  They're dead because of this man.
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:51.960]  No one knows their name.
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:53.960]  We know Trayvon Martin's name.
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:57.960]  We don't know all the, can you name me the dead cops?
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:59.960]  No, I'm embarrassed that I can't.
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:01.960]  Well, the point is just, no, you don't,
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:03.960]  because they didn't say it 85,000 times.
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:06.960]  Yeah, because they dehumanized them.
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:09.960]  And now you see the whole thing and you see how if I could
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:11.960]  get caught, partially by leftist brainwashing,
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:12.960]  and I'm pretty smart.
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:14.960]  I know why the young people get caught by it,
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:16.960]  but it's just ridiculous.
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:18.960]  Well, that's, there's two problems going on here.
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:20.960]  One is this wave of propaganda spreading lies.
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:23.960]  The other is people accepting these lies.
[2:13:23.960 --> 2:13:27.960]  We're living in the most incurious time in American history.
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:30.960]  So you have these lazy journalists sending out lies
[2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:33.960]  and then people going, oh, I hear that guy's a Nazi.
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:34.960]  Yeah, he beats kids.
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:35.960]  Yeah, I don't like that guy.
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:36.960]  They should fire him.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:38.960]  He should, he should go to jail.
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:39.960]  Oh, the proud boys, they're going to jail?
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:41.960]  Well, they're, they're an alt-right hate group.
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:43.960]  You know, the FBI said they're an alt-right hate group.
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:46.960]  No, they didn't, but they have to go to jail now.
[2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:49.960]  By the way, I really want to promote funthewest.org.
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:51.960]  That is their legal defense fund.
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:53.960]  These guys are blue collar and they're...
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:55.960]  I've been trying to get you to plug something.
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:13:56.960]  Thank you.
[2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:58.960]  You're really in the spotlight right now.
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:00.960]  Please plug for their defense.
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:01.960]  Fundthewest.org.
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:02.960]  These guys are going to trial.
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:04.960]  It's going to be $35,000 a person.
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:05.960]  Oh, yeah.
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:07.960]  That's $35,000 times nine.
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:09.960]  That's just under $350,000.
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:11.960]  They go to 1776.shop.
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:13.960]  That's a badass name.
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:14.960]  Yeah, it is.
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:15.960]  So you just buy a bracelet there.
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:17.960]  It doesn't matter what the bracelet is,
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:19.960]  but I bought the $5,000 one.
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:23.960]  You can spend as little or as much as you want.
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  But these guys need, and you know,
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:27.960]  they're probably going to try to shut this site down.
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:29.960]  What's the matter with a fair trial?
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:30.960]  Ted Bundy got a trial.
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:32.960]  Jeffrey Dahmer got a trial.
[2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:34.960]  Why are they trying to stop a legal defense fund?
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:36.960]  You keep asking why they're going to listen to moral appeals.
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:38.960]  These are not moral people.
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:40.960]  Dude, you remember when they shot Congressman Scalise
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:42.960]  and tried to kill 18 others?
[2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:45.960]  And I have the clip and they have the friend on of the guy
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:46.960]  that looked like a child molester.
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:50.960]  The guy that shot Scalise and others and tried to shoot others.
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:51.960]  And they go, he was a hero.
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:52.960]  He wasn't bad.
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:54.960]  And like, Wolf Blitzer nods his head like, yeah.
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:55.960]  Oh my God.
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:56.960]  Wasn't that because of the SBLC?
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:14:58.960]  He didn't he say one of the reasons I came here
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:01.960]  was because I saw him on the SBLC's hate list.
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:03.960]  And there was another guy at the Family Research Council,
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:06.960]  a black guy who was shot security guard
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.960]  because some nut read it on the SPLC hate list.
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:11.960]  See, when they make up these lies about us being Nazis
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:13.960]  and everything, some lunatic reads it
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:16.960]  and now we're getting shot and killed.
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:22.960]  And the SPLC is raking in $430 million that we know of.
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:23.960]  No, no, no, no.
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:24.960]  You didn't know this?
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:27.960]  Billions, several billion in offshore.
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:28.960]  Yeah.
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:29.960]  It wasn't 500 million.
[2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:31.960]  In one suit, 500 million was found.
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:33.960]  It's two billion.
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:34.960]  In the Bahamas.
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.960]  To get conservatives killed.
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:37.960]  Nice organization.
[2:15:37.960 --> 2:15:41.960]  Meanwhile, George Soros is a literal Nazi collaborator
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:43.960]  and set it on 60 minutes.
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:45.960]  But he gets awards by the time.
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:46.960]  Oh, he's called a Holocaust survivor.
[2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:48.960]  Well, technically he did survive.
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:49.960]  So did Mengele.
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:50.960]  He is.
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:51.960]  I've hardly seen him.
[2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:54.960]  We'll be back.

[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  We are your support now more than ever.
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:09.960]  You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you.
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:12.960]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential.
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:18.960]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:21.960]  But I know in God has really put it on my heart
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:24.960]  that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:27.960]  and go through as much as we can to be an example to others
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:31.960]  and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:33.960]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:34.960]  I need to be provisioned.
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:36.960]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:38.960]  and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshipers.
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:40.960]  But I need your prayers.
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:41.960]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:43.960]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[2:18:43.960 --> 2:18:44.960]  We make it easy.
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:46.960]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:49.960]  Not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon.
[2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:51.960]  And you'll help provision us.
[2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:54.960]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at m4store.com.
[2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:55.960]  So please take action right now.
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:19:00.960]  M4 Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government,
[2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:04.960]  the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:06.960]  We've been proven dead on.
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:09.960]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:11.960]  You've been the men and women of the arena.
[2:19:11.960 --> 2:19:14.960]  And I really do thank you and salute you all.
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:16.960]  Words are not enough.
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:18.960]  Think about, of all the different systems,
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:20.960]  of all the different political ideologies
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.960]  that you have been on target,
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960]  promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.960]  an open free society against the globalists
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:28.960]  and the dominant world force.
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:30.960]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:32.960]  that can't communicate with each other.
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:34.960]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:36.960]  Human liberty, a pro-human future
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:38.960]  versus the globalist anti-human future.
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:40.960]  And that's why I want to thank you all
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:42.960]  and ask you now more than ever
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:44.960]  to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.960]  I am in your hands.
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:48.960]  And we're under unprecedented attack
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:50.960]  and we just need you to go to infowars.com
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.960]  and do your Christmas shopping there
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:54.960]  and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars.
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:20:13.960]  We'll see you in the next video.
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:42.960]  All right.
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.960]  We're not talking about Gavin McInnes.
[2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:45.960]  We're talking about Alex Jones.
[2:20:45.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  We're talking about the globalist plan
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:48.960]  to shut down America and defeat the country.
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:50.960]  So they're going after us because
[2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:52.960]  they want to set the precedent
[2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:56.960]  on popular people, populists,
[2:20:56.960 --> 2:20:59.960]  but also what they see as low-hanging fruit
[2:20:59.960 --> 2:21:01.960]  because we've been satirical.
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:03.960]  We've said some wild things out of context.
[2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:04.960]  But they can take us down.
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:07.960]  The real target is Matt Grudge.
[2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:09.960]  He's the biggest thing in the world.
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:12.960]  And then their next target is everybody.
[2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:15.960]  And they've announced the Democratic Party Buzzfeed.
[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:17.960]  Oh, we've had riots in France,
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:19.960]  not because the taxes are 85% on poor people
[2:21:19.960 --> 2:21:21.960]  and the gas tax, you know, is an extra,
[2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:23.960]  you know, a euro per liter.
[2:21:23.960 --> 2:21:25.960]  So now it's like $7, basically a gallon
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:27.960]  if you transfer from liter to gallons.
[2:21:27.960 --> 2:21:31.960]  No, you're letting local farmers be on Facebook.
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:34.960]  No, no, they're pissed by the EU, by the globalism.
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.960]  So who were talking during the break
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:39.960]  and you wanted to be very, very clear how you've been targeted.
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:40.960]  The listeners get that.
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:43.960]  But how you're targeted and how they do it
[2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:46.960]  is really like a skeleton key, a rosetta stone
[2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.960]  to unlock their future operations
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:49.960]  and what they're planning.
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:52.960]  Google runs circles around the Republicans
[2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:55.960]  and they're still years later debating
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:21:58.960]  whether there's internet censorship of conservatives.
[2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:00.960]  Well, here's how the lawyer game plays.
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:04.960]  They don't call it conservative, they call it hate.
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:07.960]  We don't censor conservative.
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:09.960]  That's not one of the terms.
[2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:12.960]  We just label all real conservatism as hate
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:13.960]  and then we ban that.
[2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:16.960]  Just like Google during the last election
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:19.960]  with all Republican candidates as Nazis officially
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:20.960]  in California.
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:21.960]  It's not an algorithm.
[2:22:21.960 --> 2:22:25.960]  They program it for what they want it to do.
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:27.960]  It's all admitted and all these whistleblowers
[2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:28.960]  are coming out, Gavin McGinnis.
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:30.960]  And so you wanted to clarify,
[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:32.960]  and you also brought up Sandy Hook,
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:33.960]  which is an important point.
[2:22:33.960 --> 2:22:37.960]  Yeah, ever since that night, which was a setup,
[2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:38.960]  that was October 12th.
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:40.960]  I have been in the news every two days.
[2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:42.960]  Every time I check my phone, there's a new thing.
[2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:45.960]  A new thing I've been banned from and it's systematic.
[2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:49.960]  Hey guys, please get the penthouse magazine off my desk, please.
[2:22:49.960 --> 2:22:50.960]  We're bringing it.
[2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:51.960]  I forgot during the break.
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:52.960]  I thought you had a penthouse on your desk
[2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:53.960]  and you thought that's bad.
[2:22:53.960 --> 2:22:55.960]  No, I'm not looking at the,
[2:22:55.960 --> 2:22:57.960]  I only have it for the articles.
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:22:59.960]  I'm not going to write this one, I forgot.
[2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:00.960]  I was given it.
[2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:01.960]  It was actually delivered here.
[2:23:01.960 --> 2:23:03.960]  I guess they wanted me to have it.
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:05.960]  They had me in penthouse this month.
[2:23:05.960 --> 2:23:06.960]  And of course it's-
[2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:07.960]  Are you naked in it?
[2:23:07.960 --> 2:23:08.960]  No.
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:09.960]  Okay.
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:10.960]  Thank God.
[2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:11.960]  It's the standard statement, what you're talking about.
[2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:13.960]  So since you mentioned this, please bring it off my desk.
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:14.960]  Go ahead.
[2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:16.960]  So it's systemic and it's boom, boom, boom.
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:18.960]  Every few days, bang, bang, bang.
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:21.960]  The FBI says it's a hate group, boom, boom, boom.
[2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:22.960]  It's like artillery.
[2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:24.960]  Yeah, it's like a Chinese water torture too.
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:26.960]  They're just trying to break you down, break you down.
[2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:27.960]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:29.960]  And like with you with the Sandy Hook thing, you go,
[2:23:29.960 --> 2:23:31.960]  what's that seven years ago?
[2:23:31.960 --> 2:23:32.960]  Why is this in the news now?
[2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:33.960]  Bang, bang.
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:37.960]  They are on a full offense for the next two years
[2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:41.960]  to make sure that they obliterate anyone who might help Trump
[2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:44.960]  because they cannot lose this election.
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:45.960]  And they will kill people.
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:47.960]  They will ruin lives.
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:48.960]  They will de-platform.
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:50.960]  They will get unemployed people.
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:53.960]  It's going to be death and destruction for them
[2:23:53.960 --> 2:23:55.960]  to prevent Trump from winning.
[2:23:55.960 --> 2:23:56.960]  And he's going to win.
[2:23:56.960 --> 2:23:57.960]  He's going to get re-elected.
[2:23:57.960 --> 2:24:02.960]  And the crazy part is we haven't seen nothing yet.
[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:07.960]  When they finally lose in 2020,
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:10.960]  the rioting on the streets is going to be brutal.
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:12.960]  I'm not exaggerating.
[2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:14.960]  I would say, don't be in the country.
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:16.960]  If you're a Republican, you're a right wing.
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:20.960]  I would say to you, don't be in the country on that day
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:25.960]  because we've already seen what happened in D.C.
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:27.960]  We've already seen these riots.
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:30.960]  I just remembered something that was really crazy.
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:32.960]  So there's this patriot guy.
[2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:34.960]  I forget his name, but he's in Philadelphia.
[2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:37.960]  And he says, I want to have a rally for the Constitution.
[2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:39.960]  Let's call it We the People.
[2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:42.960]  And we'll go there and we'll dress up like George Washington
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:43.960]  and stuff.
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:44.960]  And we'll have Liberty Bells.
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:46.960]  And we'll just say, let's get back to the Constitution.
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:49.960]  So he announces this rally.
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:55.960]  The narrative becomes, proud boys are going to have a Nazi rally
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:25:00.960]  in front of the Jewish Museum to celebrate the synagogue sling.
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:04.960]  And you go, what?
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:05.960]  What?
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:08.960]  Like in Germany in 1940?
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:12.960]  In 1943, I bet Nazis would go, that's a bit rich.
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:16.960]  Meanwhile, an actual Nazi is funding him, George Soros.
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:17.960]  Right.
[2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:20.960]  So the final event happens and they're all there screaming,
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:21.960]  we don't want Nazis in our town.
[2:25:21.960 --> 2:25:22.960]  You go, what?
[2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:24.960]  What are you talking about?
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:28.960]  Why would the mayor give a permit to Nazis to celebrate a synagogue shooting?
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:29.960]  But I think you just said it.
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:30.960]  That's insane.
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:33.960]  The left followers want to buy in the lies.
[2:25:33.960 --> 2:25:34.960]  Yeah, fun.
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:36.960]  Because they're not actually going out to face real Nazis.
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:40.960]  They're just showing up and just being hateful little bastards.
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:42.960]  Look, I think it goes back to the Freedom Riders.
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:45.960]  The Freedom Riders were inarguably cool.
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:49.960]  It was cool of them to go to the segregated south with blacks and whites
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:51.960]  and get the crap beat out of them and say,
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:53.960]  we're not going to stand up for it.
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:55.960]  Sure, it was like, it was, it was Gandhi-esque.
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:25:56.960]  Yeah.
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:25:57.960]  And they had suits on and bloody noses.
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:25:59.960]  And I think people look at history books and they go,
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:00.960]  I wish I had a cousin.
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:01.960]  Charlton Heston was part of that.
[2:26:01.960 --> 2:26:02.960]  Oh, really?
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:03.960]  Well, okay.
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:05.960]  So that was incredibly cool.
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:06.960]  Sorry.
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:07.960]  That's done now.
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:09.960]  America's not a racist hellhole anymore.
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:11.960]  There's no, you can't be a freedom rider.
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:12.960]  You're not fighting Nazis.
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:14.960]  Our audience, our audience knows that.
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:17.960]  But here, let's go for the TV viewers, this penthouse magazine.
[2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:20.960]  We're not going to show you any of the horrible stuff here.
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:21.960]  We were Sharia compliant.
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:23.960]  Dr. McCamshaw plays.
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:26.960]  But that is a nice creation of the good Lord.
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:29.960]  Now, they have a big fan of God.
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:30.960]  God's artwork here.
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:33.960]  But let me, let me go to the part that I'm in here.
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:36.960]  This is on the news today as well.
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:38.960]  We're turning the frogs gay.
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:39.960]  And somebody said XOXO.
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:44.960]  I don't know who even sent me this, but where's my pen?
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:46.960]  Now, for TV viewers, here it is.
[2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:52.960]  Now, when you read what they say about me here, it says,
[2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:55.960]  he says no one died at Sandy Hook and he won't apologize.
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:27:01.960]  And it goes on to, you know, say all these things about me that aren't true.
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:05.960]  In fact, on Twitter, they said something different than they even say here.
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:09.960]  So they said less here, but it's always the same scripting.
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:11.960]  And then I get these calls.
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:12.960]  Yes, great point.
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:17.960]  I get these calls and the New York Times goes, will you apologize for saying no one died?
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:22.960]  And then I say, well, the internet questioned it and there were some anomalies.
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:25.960]  But three years ago, I said, I thought it happened.
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:28.960]  And then I sent them the videos and it's not in the news.
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:32.960]  They were at a New York Times article saying Jones sent more people their houses.
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:35.960]  Even though we contacted him, he wouldn't stop.
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:43.960]  And so it's actually the media that keeps republishing this and then contacting families and telling them,
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:45.960]  I said things I didn't say.
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:54.960]  So this is the same example of how it happens over and over and over and over again because they looked at everything I ever said or did.
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:03.960]  And they picked that and they picked it because years ago, I said, you know, even when I cover internet, people asking questions,
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:08.960]  I need to be clear that, you know, because they threw babies at incubators and actually didn't do that,
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:11.960]  but said they did launch the Iraq war that killed millions.
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:14.960]  If there was more babies from incubators in another country, I'm going to have to question it.
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:17.960]  If it turns out the babies didn't get killed, I'll say, OK, well, they didn't get killed here.
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:18.960]  They did here.
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:19.960]  We have to question.
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:20.960]  That's normal.
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:23.960]  Like, you know, wag the dog the movie.
[2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:28.960]  But they'll never let me say that because they just think that they basically pigeonhole.
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:29.960]  Yeah.
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:33.960]  And I'm glad you brought up that they use the same verbiage because that's a tip-off that this is all coming from.
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:34.960]  Oh, it's a script.
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:35.960]  I mean, they just put it out.
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:39.960]  It's like, you know, Jones is just bullied and then they have the parents.
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:45.960]  They go to the graves of their kids and say, Alex just won't apologize.
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:46.960]  He just won't stop.
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:48.960]  So I do it again like 150 times.
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:52.960]  I send them the videos and they just keep saying it.
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:53.960]  They just keep saying.

[2:31:55.960 --> 2:32:01.960]  We need to build back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:05.960]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[2:32:05.960 --> 2:32:07.960]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:19.960]  The First Amendment, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:25.960]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:27.960]  We have seen what they want to do.
[2:32:27.960 --> 2:32:29.960]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[2:32:29.960 --> 2:32:31.960]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[2:32:31.960 --> 2:32:34.960]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:36.960]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:43.960]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:45.960]  It's The David Knight Show.
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:47.960]  I've never missed your show.
[2:32:47.960 --> 2:32:48.960]  And he did.
[2:32:48.960 --> 2:32:49.960]  And I mean, what?
[2:32:49.960 --> 2:32:51.960]  I mean, never.
[2:32:51.960 --> 2:33:07.960]  EditForce.com.
[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:44.960]  Now again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not reading this from the Twitter to Penthouse or from the Penthouse Magazine.
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:46.960]  It's just about us.
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:50.960]  I'm reading it because every article I'm telling you,
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:53.960]  they've had 10,000 articles in a day before.
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:33:56.960]  Because when AP put something out, it's in every newspaper.
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:33:58.960]  So to say 10,000, it's way above that.
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:03.960]  I mean, I subscribed to LexisNexis and Thompson Reuters and stuff to look this up.
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:08.960]  And last year, it was like a million stories.
[2:34:08.960 --> 2:34:10.960]  This year, I didn't even look.
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:15.960]  I mean, it's settled down some because they realized a lot of it backfired.
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:17.960]  But let's just go over this.
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:20.960]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it, please put the tweet back on screen.
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:22.960]  My eyes aren't what they used to be.
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:24.960]  And scroll down.
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:31.960]  This is from Penthouse and they put me in their Penthouse issue called Culture Wars.
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:35.960]  And again, can I make something clear?
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:38.960]  Penthouse America is run by a lesbian.
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:40.960]  She doesn't like men.
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:42.960]  They're going bankrupt.
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:48.960]  And all she does is put in her lesbian friends and it has a feminist kind of a vibe to it now,
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:50.960]  which is making them bankrupt.
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:53.960]  I know I was reading it earlier and it's how men are bad.
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:58.960]  Like all they're doing is teaching women how to like not get into that whole area of power.
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:05.960]  Yeah, you're reading basically a feminist lesbian manhating magazine and it's Penthouse.
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:08.960]  So let's go back to it because they put more stuff out in the tweet.
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:12.960]  What's wrong guys?
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:15.960]  Well, this is obviously a different tweet you guys have found.
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:16.960]  Let me read it off my phone.
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:18.960]  The 50th time is the charm.
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:20.960]  No, no, it's not there at all.
[2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:22.960]  The 50th time is the charm.
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:27.960]  So I will, I will now read this the 50th time that I tried to get this show.
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:28.960]  Here you go.
[2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:34.960]  It says despite having the net worth of a top tier Victoria's secret model.
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:38.960]  I guess that shows the woman right. This is obsessed with models. That's not even true.
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:40.960]  Some of them make like $20 million a year.
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:44.960]  In Four Wars mogul. See that's their new angle on this mogul.
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:46.960]  Alex Jones is not happy with America.
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:47.960]  No, I love America.
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:50.960]  It's a Democrat saying we can't even say America exists.
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:56.960]  After years of spewing crazy conspiracy theories and so-called insider government information about chemtrails,
[2:35:56.960 --> 2:35:58.960]  total geoengineering is admitted.
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:01.960]  Jones was recently booted from all social media platforms.
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:10.960]  Twitter initially let Jones stay in the game, but then big old dumb dumb flew from Texas to Washington D.C. to scream at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's face.
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:17.960]  Yeah, Dorsey said despite the fact that Alex has killed the media, which I didn't say, I'll leave him on.
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:19.960]  That's just stupid to think about.
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:22.960]  A brilliant move that predictably backfired.
[2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:24.960]  No, I don't kiss their butt, stay on their platform.
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:35.960]  Instead of admitting his own faults and that he may just may have taken it a bit too far with his claim that government was turning frogs gay with estrogen.
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:36.960]  That's all over the news.
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:44.960]  Jones was whipped like a puppy dog and all that has happened as his refused to apologize, which that's not even true,
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:54.960]  for calling Sandy Hook school over school a hoax and encouraging his fans to attack the parents.
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:02.960]  You'll put a link to this of the victims like his daddy, Donald Trump, Jones cries victim while monetizing one of the biggest bully pulpits of the web.
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:09.960]  But hey, not even Jack Dorsey can stop him from selling Patriot Pantry Pizza.
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:15.960]  First of all, that does not sound like a men's magazine writer. That sounds like a feminist writer.
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:23.960]  Secondly, this notion that you're this sort of this wizard, the man behind the curtain who is sending people to homes to harass them.
[2:37:23.960 --> 2:37:24.960]  I got that too.
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:31.960]  They said he lives in the in the wealthy suburbs but commands these proud boys to go and attack people because that's the left.
[2:37:31.960 --> 2:37:33.960]  They're old for rich commanding.
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:34.960]  Right.
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:36.960]  Make that again.
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:45.960]  You said you have the big billionaire globalist at the tech companies and then they have the newspapers put lies out about us that are millionaires.
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:47.960]  And then they send the method Antifa after us.
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:51.960]  And then they're and then it's crazy and then everything they say about us is them.
[2:37:51.960 --> 2:38:03.960]  And there's I'm just I'm really becoming red pilled or my eyes are opening more than ever this past year because I used to just think there's Antifa and then there's the media has left and right.
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:07.960]  And then there's the government. It's all the same team.
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:10.960]  And I've had Fox News puts out the same talking points.
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:18.960]  I've been I've been I've been trying to get proud boys out of jail and the media will find out details about their case before the lawyers do.
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:20.960]  And you go or when I was banned from Australia.
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:27.960]  Why did the media know I was banned from Australia before my immigrant all the corporate media knew when I was banned on my apps or everything.
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:33.960]  Six seven hours before and they would all have a D day and they'd all publish it in the exact time they'll agree.
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:36.960]  No one published the same word thousands would publish it one minute.
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:38.960]  And and why was that by that.
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:46.960]  Why was Cuomo going with the alt-right hate gang minutes after or sorry immediately after there was an attack and then Bill de Blasio.
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:51.960]  Boom boom when I got banned when my Apple app got banned because they called for it.
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:56.960]  There were over a thousand articles published the same minute.
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:38:59.960]  And some of these were like five pages long.
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:02.960]  They'd all gotten the news that they before they'd all written it.
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:03.960]  They all agree.
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:05.960]  They're all of these dashboard interfaces.
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:07.960]  Brigading.
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:11.960]  You know that's kind of a good thing about Twitter where you can start seeing who these people are.
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:17.960]  And I didn't know this but a lot of prosecutors in court especially in New York are social justice warriors.
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:18.960]  Oh yeah.
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:20.960]  And you read their Twitter feed and it's all about Trump has to die.
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:22.960]  And you're like this is blind justice.
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:24.960]  The new the new people holding the scale.
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:26.960]  New York's new prosecutor coming in.
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:28.960]  The head prosecutor says I'm going to harass.
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:30.960]  I'm going to take his family down.
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:33.960]  Used to you would lose your job as bias right there.
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:36.960]  I was so naive about the justice system.
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:42.960]  And I the more I look at it because Proud Boys has got me involved in law and I've been talking to lawyers and seeing judges.
[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:50.960]  We got a judge in New York who who defecated her chair and then complained that no one's got her a new chair.
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:56.960]  Let's go further. Let's go further. I'm not going to get into inside baseball.
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:02.960]  But you've seen you've seen all these big battles to take my kids away with the media got involved in.
[2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:06.960]  I mean there would be custody battles where you would have 50 members of the media.
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:09.960]  I'm 50 New York Times Washington Post bus fee.
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:15.960]  And when they would have reporters.
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:22.960]  Go out and write total lies I've come to them and I'd say you saw what was said in court right and you saw what the jury actually said.
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:24.960]  And they didn't care as a wall.
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:26.960]  They all lied about the verdict.
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:28.960]  They all lied about what was said.
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:30.960]  They and it was the discipline.
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:32.960]  How unified they are.
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:33.960]  Yeah.
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:43.960]  Journalists are activists now that you said that the whole notion of the Watergate guys with their sleeves rolled up and staying at the at the headquarters all night, you know, eating a pizza and I think I have a scoop.
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:46.960]  They get a plagiarism isn't accepted.
[2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:48.960]  It's it's demanded.
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:49.960]  They just get their order.
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:51.960]  They rewrite it.
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:52.960]  And then it comes out.
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:53.960]  It's a PR firm.
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:41:01.960]  They are publicists and they work for the DNC and I in the past two months have learned so much about the cohesion.
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:03.960]  Gavin Gavin Gavin Gavin Gavin.
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:06.960]  I have my children 80% of the time.
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:15.960]  I walk down the street with my children and people go f you glad you lost your family and these two gay guys and they told me they were gay.
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:17.960]  Well, I was coming back from from Colorado last year.
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:19.960]  They had a snowboarding championship there.
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:20.960]  These big guys come on the plane.
[2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:24.960]  They go f you Jones, you know, glad you lost your family and I'm sitting there with all my kids.
[2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:25.960]  I said, do you mind?
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:28.960]  This is my family, my new wife, my four children, one with her through it.
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:32.960]  And when we got off the plane, they try to start a fight with my son at the baggage claim.
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:37.960]  He was 15 then and they literally, they're literally there in my face.
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:40.960]  And then I go, see, I have my family.
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:42.960]  He goes, well, then f your family.
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:49.960]  So that's how sick the left is, is that they were literally, they don't know what to do because they don't know my kids and my super gorgeous wife.
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:53.960]  And they just and my kids all are great and they crap themselves.
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:56.960]  You know what bloods do when they see a Crip with his kids?
[2:41:56.960 --> 2:41:59.960]  They go, God, maybe I'll get them later.
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.960]  You know what the mob does? You know what organized gangsters criminals do when they see an opponent with his kids?
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:08.960]  They go, I guess I'll, why was he with his kids?
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:09.960]  That was a less attack.
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:10.960]  That's one thing.
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:18.960]  But yeah, so they are, they have less scruples than bloods and Crips gang bangers are more moral than these political activists who are out there.
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:19.960]  Oh, they followed my son.
[2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:22.960]  He already got the bat and tried to start a fight with it.
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  For what?
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:25.960]  Is that going to be good footage?
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:27.960]  Now Alex Jones son, violent attack.
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:28.960]  Like that's exactly what they did.
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:32.960]  My son already loved me and did whatever I told him way better than I was.
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:36.960]  But that kind of crap now has him like worshipful.
[2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:38.960]  It's actually not even, but that's the persecution.
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:39.960]  Did that.
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:40.960]  I don't think other fathers have that.
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:41.960]  Yeah, my wife is a liberal.
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:42.960]  I don't think she's a liberal anymore.
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:43.960]  She voted for Hillary.
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:44.960]  I think they converted her.
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:45.960]  Good work, guys.
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:49.960]  We're going to win though.
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:51.960]  I'm going to say that my kids too.
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:58.960]  Empho wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government.
[2:42:58.960 --> 2:43:02.960]  The attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:04.960]  We've been proven dead on.
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:08.960]  You been proven dead on the supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:11.960]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do.
[2:43:11.960 --> 2:43:13.960]  Thank you and salute you all.
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:14.960]  Words are not enough.
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:15.960]  Think about it.
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:20.960]  Of all the different systems of all the different political ideologies that you have been on
[2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:24.300]  have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[2:43:24.300 --> 2:43:26.620]  an open free society against the globalist
[2:43:26.620 --> 2:43:28.460]  and the dominant world force.
[2:43:28.460 --> 2:43:29.980]  They've created a tower of babel
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:32.340]  with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[2:43:32.340 --> 2:43:34.220]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[2:43:34.220 --> 2:43:36.180]  Human liberty, a pro-human future
[2:43:36.180 --> 2:43:38.820]  versus the globalist anti-human future.
[2:43:38.820 --> 2:43:40.060]  And that's why I want to thank you all
[2:43:40.060 --> 2:43:41.580]  and ask you now more than ever

[2:46:01.460 --> 2:46:03.540]  and every system throughout history
[2:46:03.540 --> 2:46:05.020]  that wants to hurt children.
[2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:07.900]  They wanna abort children, they wanna disease children,
[2:46:07.900 --> 2:46:10.620]  they wanna abuse children, they wanna confuse children.
[2:46:10.620 --> 2:46:12.780]  They want their essence, they want their soul,
[2:46:12.780 --> 2:46:15.860]  they want their spirit, they want their power
[2:46:15.860 --> 2:46:17.980]  because they are our future.

[2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:23.540]  It is about the West.
[2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:26.020]  It is about a human future and standing with each other
[2:46:26.020 --> 2:46:27.780]  and believing in a better future.
[2:46:27.780 --> 2:46:30.540]  So I wanna thank you all for your support,
[2:46:30.540 --> 2:46:33.140]  but I wanna ask you all to pray for your own family,
[2:46:33.140 --> 2:46:35.660]  to pray for America, to pray for President Trump,
[2:46:35.660 --> 2:46:37.180]  and to pray for Infowars,
[2:46:37.180 --> 2:46:40.300]  and to remember that you have the power
[2:46:40.300 --> 2:46:41.140]  to change the world.
[2:46:41.140 --> 2:46:43.020]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[2:46:43.020 --> 2:46:45.420]  You have the power to stop the globalists
[2:46:45.420 --> 2:46:46.820]  dead in their tracks.
[2:46:46.820 --> 2:46:48.660]  I know you've been taking action, I salute you,
[2:46:48.660 --> 2:46:50.900]  but just remember, I know you're humble,
[2:46:50.900 --> 2:46:53.180]  but just remember, you hold the future
[2:46:53.180 --> 2:46:55.620]  of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[2:46:59.740 --> 2:47:02.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:02.780 --> 2:47:07.780]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:08.780 --> 2:47:11.780]  I used to be such a sweet sweet angel,
[2:47:11.780 --> 2:47:13.780]  hey, you gotta hold up me.
[2:47:15.780 --> 2:47:18.780]  I want to know what's the little hole in your heart
[2:47:18.780 --> 2:47:20.780]  that you put in your heart.
[2:47:20.780 --> 2:47:23.780]  I know you've been taking action, I salute you,
[2:47:23.780 --> 2:47:26.780]  but just remember, I know you're humble,
[2:47:26.780 --> 2:47:29.780]  but just remember, you hold the future
[2:47:29.780 --> 2:47:31.780]  of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[2:47:31.780 --> 2:47:36.780]  And little old ladies, I held the blind to see.
[2:47:37.780 --> 2:47:41.780]  I got no friends, cuz they read the papers.
[2:47:41.780 --> 2:47:45.780]  They can't be seen with me,
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:48.780]  and I'm getting real shot down,
[2:47:48.780 --> 2:47:51.780]  and I'm feeling me.
[2:47:52.780 --> 2:47:55.780]  No more, Mr. Night Sky.
[2:47:56.780 --> 2:47:58.780]  No more, Mr. G.
[2:47:58.780 --> 2:48:01.780]  All right, we're going 15 minutes to the next hour,
[2:48:01.780 --> 2:48:03.780]  and then Hagman and Hagman are taking over,
[2:48:03.780 --> 2:48:06.780]  and then there's a war room, Gavin will pop back in on that.
[2:48:06.780 --> 2:48:08.780]  I'm gonna plug right now, we're gonna go bankrupt.
[2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:10.780]  I look like Don Imus, don't I?
[2:48:10.780 --> 2:48:12.780]  Please don't, no, you don't look like Don Imus.
[2:48:12.780 --> 2:48:15.780]  I look like Don Imus if he was a mammal, a furry mammal.
[2:48:15.780 --> 2:48:17.780]  Yeah, instead of like a reptoid.
[2:48:17.780 --> 2:48:19.780]  Let's get serious though.
[2:48:19.780 --> 2:48:24.780]  Listeners, I need your support, you know that,
[2:48:24.780 --> 2:48:27.780]  and I'm trying to build a bigger thing with more reporters,
[2:48:27.780 --> 2:48:29.780]  more people, I'm fighting,
[2:48:29.780 --> 2:48:32.780]  and I'm not complaining when we get attacked,
[2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:35.780]  but I sell really awesome products
[2:48:35.780 --> 2:48:37.780]  at the lowest prices you're gonna find them.
[2:48:37.780 --> 2:48:41.780]  I go out and find out what is the hottest thing,
[2:48:41.780 --> 2:48:44.780]  what is, got the best ratings,
[2:48:44.780 --> 2:48:46.780]  what's got the best testing,
[2:48:46.780 --> 2:48:49.780]  and then I call up the manufacturer and I say,
[2:48:49.780 --> 2:48:52.780]  give me a chance, I'm gonna be your biggest distributor,
[2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:56.780]  I want the lowest map pricing you've ever given,
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:48:59.780]  and I do it on storeable food, I do it on water filters,
[2:48:59.780 --> 2:49:01.780]  I do it on air filters,
[2:49:01.780 --> 2:49:03.780]  and I've learned doing this 24 years on air, you know,
[2:49:03.780 --> 2:49:05.780]  I knew water filters were big with people in the Liberty Movement,
[2:49:05.780 --> 2:49:07.780]  I was already having them,
[2:49:07.780 --> 2:49:09.780]  and then the filters would get crappy,
[2:49:09.780 --> 2:49:11.780]  even though it was a good, all the sudden it was like,
[2:49:11.780 --> 2:49:13.780]  they'd go into the phase of just making money,
[2:49:13.780 --> 2:49:15.780]  and I'd say, I'm not carrying your filter anymore,
[2:49:15.780 --> 2:49:18.780]  to a major company, everybody knows their name,
[2:49:18.780 --> 2:49:20.780]  because I got complaints and I didn't like it,
[2:49:20.780 --> 2:49:22.780]  and I was like, I was using it myself,
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:25.780]  so I went out and found the very best company out there,
[2:49:25.780 --> 2:49:27.780]  and the filters were really good as well,
[2:49:27.780 --> 2:49:29.780]  so whatever's good, we sell it,
[2:49:29.780 --> 2:49:31.780]  and you heard me with the Alexa Pure Pro,
[2:49:31.780 --> 2:49:33.780]  big stainless steel gravity filter,
[2:49:33.780 --> 2:49:35.780]  leading competitors, 300, 400 bucks,
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:37.780]  it's 247 usually,
[2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:39.780]  I told you, I said it's year in,
[2:49:39.780 --> 2:49:41.780]  they want to sell it at XS Inventory,
[2:49:41.780 --> 2:49:43.780]  126,
[2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:46.780]  we made $33 on each one,
[2:49:46.780 --> 2:49:48.780]  no one ever had one of those at that price,
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:50.780]  it's the best filtration, cuts all the bad stuff,
[2:49:50.780 --> 2:49:52.780]  leaves in the good minerals,
[2:49:52.780 --> 2:49:54.780]  so I told you Alexa Pure Breeze is their four stage,
[2:49:54.780 --> 2:49:56.780]  ion filtration,
[2:49:56.780 --> 2:49:58.780]  leading competitors used to be 800 bucks
[2:49:58.780 --> 2:50:00.780]  when they first came out, now because the market,
[2:50:00.780 --> 2:50:03.780]  you know, Alexa Pure Breeze used to be 400,
[2:50:03.780 --> 2:50:05.780]  now they're 250,
[2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:07.780]  because prices go down,
[2:50:07.780 --> 2:50:09.780]  technology gets cheaper,
[2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:11.780]  it's 126 again,
[2:50:11.780 --> 2:50:14.780]  these will sell out by this weekend,
[2:50:14.780 --> 2:50:16.780]  one of them does a really big room,
[2:50:16.780 --> 2:50:18.780]  couple of them will do a small house,
[2:50:18.780 --> 2:50:20.780]  I've got them in every room of this office,
[2:50:20.780 --> 2:50:22.780]  I've got them everywhere,
[2:50:22.780 --> 2:50:24.780]  I'll stop the filter every few months,
[2:50:24.780 --> 2:50:26.780]  wipe it off, wash it off,
[2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:28.780]  when it's picking up stuff in the room,
[2:50:28.780 --> 2:50:30.780]  let me tell you how accurate these are,
[2:50:30.780 --> 2:50:32.780]  I don't want to be gross, but it's true,
[2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:34.780]  I have one in the garage where I work out,
[2:50:34.780 --> 2:50:36.780]  and if someone passes gas
[2:50:36.780 --> 2:50:38.780]  20 feet away from it, it goes from blue
[2:50:38.780 --> 2:50:40.780]  to red in one second,
[2:50:40.780 --> 2:50:42.780]  the sensor is incredible,
[2:50:42.780 --> 2:50:44.780]  because it's telling you when it's red,
[2:50:44.780 --> 2:50:46.780]  it's picking up particulates and gasses and things,
[2:50:46.780 --> 2:50:48.780]  it's unbelievable,
[2:50:48.780 --> 2:50:50.780]  you need one of these,
[2:50:50.780 --> 2:50:52.780]  we're on the M4, everybody get theirs today,
[2:50:52.780 --> 2:50:54.780]  M4shore.com,
[2:50:54.780 --> 2:50:56.780]  separately, we have 50 to 75% off,
[2:50:56.780 --> 2:50:58.780]  all the supplements,
[2:50:58.780 --> 2:51:00.780]  all the pharmaceuticals,
[2:51:00.780 --> 2:51:02.780]  M4shore.com right now,
[2:51:02.780 --> 2:51:04.780]  many of these are being sold at below cost,
[2:51:04.780 --> 2:51:06.780]  because it's year-end,
[2:51:06.780 --> 2:51:08.780]  Thoros is trying to take our payment processes away,
[2:51:08.780 --> 2:51:10.780]  he got us down to one, we got a few backups now,
[2:51:10.780 --> 2:51:12.780]  but I'm not, I'm like, look,
[2:51:12.780 --> 2:51:14.780]  I usually keep six months ahead of supply,
[2:51:14.780 --> 2:51:16.780]  not anymore because of this,
[2:51:16.780 --> 2:51:18.780]  we're going to keep it one month of supply,
[2:51:18.780 --> 2:51:20.780]  every book, every film, you name it,
[2:51:20.780 --> 2:51:22.780]  free t-shirt, 50 to 75% off,
[2:51:22.780 --> 2:51:24.780]  store-wide,
[2:51:24.780 --> 2:51:26.780]  double-patriot points to your next order,
[2:51:26.780 --> 2:51:28.780]  so if you spend 50 bucks, you know,
[2:51:28.780 --> 2:51:30.780]  you get 10% of that on your next order,
[2:51:30.780 --> 2:51:32.780]  set a 5%, it's this huge rewards program,
[2:51:32.780 --> 2:51:34.780]  free shipping store-wide,
[2:51:34.780 --> 2:51:36.780]  the free t-shirt,
[2:51:36.780 --> 2:51:38.780]  and the big best seller we had sold out,
[2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:40.780]  so now it's a grab bag of all our other shirts
[2:51:40.780 --> 2:51:42.780]  to sell over the years, it'll be a mystery shirt,
[2:51:42.780 --> 2:51:44.780]  you just say your size, you'll get one,
[2:51:44.780 --> 2:51:46.780]  most of these orders lose $10,
[2:51:46.780 --> 2:51:48.780]  we're basically paying that in taxes,
[2:51:48.780 --> 2:51:50.780]  so we're all working together, we're getting a great deal,
[2:51:50.780 --> 2:51:52.780]  don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds,
[2:51:52.780 --> 2:51:54.780]  support the InfoWare,
[2:51:54.780 --> 2:51:56.780]  put a note on your order,
[2:51:56.780 --> 2:51:58.780]  you can deliver it to friends and family,
[2:51:58.780 --> 2:52:00.780]  hey, here's your Christmas present from Alex Jones,
[2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:02.780]  but put the note on there so we open the,
[2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:04.780]  you know, put their name on the order,
[2:52:04.780 --> 2:52:06.780]  and then put the name on the receipts so they know they got it,
[2:52:06.780 --> 2:52:08.780]  because as long as that stuff gets sent back,
[2:52:08.780 --> 2:52:10.780]  people don't know why they got sent a water filter
[2:52:10.780 --> 2:52:12.780]  or a book or a t-shirt or whatever,
[2:52:12.780 --> 2:52:16.780]  go to infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:52:16.780 --> 2:52:18.780]  Now, I want to open the phones up
[2:52:18.780 --> 2:52:21.780]  for the next two segments for Gavin McInnis
[2:52:21.780 --> 2:52:23.780]  to ask your questions, to make your statements,
[2:52:23.780 --> 2:52:26.780]  do whatever you want to do, 877-789-ALEX,
[2:52:26.780 --> 2:52:31.780]  877-789-2539, specifically Gavin McInnis.
[2:52:31.780 --> 2:52:33.780]  For Proud Boys, go to the front of the line,
[2:52:33.780 --> 2:52:36.780]  Patriots, law enforcement,
[2:52:36.780 --> 2:52:38.780]  let us know who you are, we'll go right to your calls,
[2:52:38.780 --> 2:52:40.780]  877-789-2539.
[2:52:40.780 --> 2:52:42.780]  Now, you get me wound up, so I've been interrupting a lot,
[2:52:42.780 --> 2:52:44.780]  you've made a lot of good points,
[2:52:44.780 --> 2:52:46.780]  but for the rest of this segment, you've got the floor.
[2:52:46.780 --> 2:52:49.780]  What else would you like to add?
[2:52:49.780 --> 2:52:51.780]  I'd like to add something.
[2:52:51.780 --> 2:52:56.780]  This is a good example of the war on men.
[2:52:56.780 --> 2:53:00.780]  This is a magazine that was supposed to be a men's magazine,
[2:53:00.780 --> 2:53:04.780]  and they gave it to a lesbian who clearly doesn't like men at all,
[2:53:04.780 --> 2:53:05.780]  and she's ruining it.
[2:53:05.780 --> 2:53:06.780]  What about Penthouse that's demonizing me?
[2:53:06.780 --> 2:53:08.780]  Penthouse America, yeah.
[2:53:08.780 --> 2:53:10.780]  Can't men celebrate women?
[2:53:10.780 --> 2:53:12.780]  Penthouse Australia is still really cool,
[2:53:12.780 --> 2:53:15.780]  but the real problem with the Proud Boys,
[2:53:15.780 --> 2:53:18.780]  besides the whole Trump thing, and they make Trump look fun,
[2:53:18.780 --> 2:53:20.780]  and they threaten Antifa,
[2:53:20.780 --> 2:53:23.780]  for some reason you're not allowed to have a men's club anymore.
[2:53:23.780 --> 2:53:28.780]  They used to be everywhere, the Elks Lodge and the Shriners,
[2:53:28.780 --> 2:53:32.780]  and every dad went to his men's club after work,
[2:53:32.780 --> 2:53:34.780]  and you don't see that anymore.
[2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:38.780]  You look at the way Homer Simpson is depicted in The Simpsons.
[2:53:38.780 --> 2:53:42.780]  Every married with children, every father figure since the 70s is an idiot.
[2:53:42.780 --> 2:53:43.780]  They're demoralizing us.
[2:53:43.780 --> 2:53:44.780]  It's declassified.
[2:53:44.780 --> 2:53:45.780]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[2:53:45.780 --> 2:53:48.780]  This is the leftist CIA trying to break our families up.
[2:53:48.780 --> 2:53:49.780]  It's outrageous.
[2:53:49.780 --> 2:53:51.780]  But what I love is how the NFL's going bankrupt,
[2:53:51.780 --> 2:53:53.780]  Hollywood's losing money.
[2:53:53.780 --> 2:53:55.780]  Everything that does this, people turn away from.
[2:53:55.780 --> 2:53:56.780]  It's beautiful.
[2:53:56.780 --> 2:53:57.780]  So now they've resorted to censorship.
[2:53:57.780 --> 2:53:58.780]  Sorry, I said you had the floor.
[2:53:58.780 --> 2:53:59.780]  No, no.
[2:53:59.780 --> 2:54:01.780]  I like to watch action movies.
[2:54:01.780 --> 2:54:03.780]  Back when I had a job, I would go to DC,
[2:54:03.780 --> 2:54:04.780]  and I'd be on the train.
[2:54:04.780 --> 2:54:07.780]  And if you're renting a movie, you don't want to get a rom-com,
[2:54:07.780 --> 2:54:09.780]  because then the guy's sitting next to you,
[2:54:09.780 --> 2:54:11.780]  and he sees two people kissing.
[2:54:11.780 --> 2:54:12.780]  It's not a good look.
[2:54:12.780 --> 2:54:14.780]  So I only get action movies when I travel,
[2:54:14.780 --> 2:54:17.780]  because if other people see me, they see it's cool stuff.
[2:54:17.780 --> 2:54:18.780]  So that's a good point.
[2:54:18.780 --> 2:54:21.780]  You don't want to get an R-rated love story or something,
[2:54:21.780 --> 2:54:24.780]  because someone's walking by you on the train,
[2:54:24.780 --> 2:54:26.780]  and they just see two naked people.
[2:54:26.780 --> 2:54:27.780]  No, I just want action.
[2:54:27.780 --> 2:54:32.780]  And every single movie has been ruined by these badass kick ass people.
[2:54:32.780 --> 2:54:34.780]  Bad ass kick ass chicks.
[2:54:34.780 --> 2:54:35.780]  I watched one the other day.
[2:54:35.780 --> 2:54:37.780]  No, that was an order seven years ago
[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:39.780]  that every hero has to be a woman.
[2:54:39.780 --> 2:54:41.780]  They wanted to make James Bond a black woman now.
[2:54:41.780 --> 2:54:43.780]  And I was watching this movie.
[2:54:43.780 --> 2:54:44.780]  Ghostbusters.
[2:54:44.780 --> 2:54:45.780]  These guys, ghostbusters, they ruined.
[2:54:45.780 --> 2:54:48.780]  These guys are robbing a bank, the Federal Reserve,
[2:54:48.780 --> 2:54:54.780]  during a hurricane, during a major environmental disaster, right?
[2:54:54.780 --> 2:54:56.780]  Guess who kicks their ass and stops them?
[2:54:56.780 --> 2:55:00.780]  Some chick who is about half the size of my daughter,
[2:55:00.780 --> 2:55:03.780]  like some little woman is there.
[2:55:03.780 --> 2:55:05.780]  Presumably if you're robbing the Federal Reserve,
[2:55:05.780 --> 2:55:08.780]  you're in some of the top echelons of crime.
[2:55:08.780 --> 2:55:10.780]  Like these guys were ex-marines, Navy SEALs,
[2:55:10.780 --> 2:55:11.780]  and they had been to prison.
[2:55:11.780 --> 2:55:14.780]  And she busts the case open?
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:15.780]  Come on!
[2:55:15.780 --> 2:55:17.780]  Listen, my buddy Shane Stoner,
[2:55:17.780 --> 2:55:19.780]  as a super heart, you know,
[2:55:19.780 --> 2:55:22.780]  his whole family are world champion bull rodders, you name it.
[2:55:22.780 --> 2:55:28.780]  We are at main event where you can play pool and bowl with our kids,
[2:55:28.780 --> 2:55:30.780]  and his wife's a beauty queen.
[2:55:30.780 --> 2:55:32.780]  Okay, and I'm with my kids, my wife's not there.
[2:55:32.780 --> 2:55:35.780]  I'm with my kids, his kids, and we're playing pool,
[2:55:35.780 --> 2:55:37.780]  and there's these two lesbians,
[2:55:37.780 --> 2:55:39.780]  and I'm not against something like women like women too,
[2:55:39.780 --> 2:55:42.780]  but they both got duck's ass haircuts, look like grease,
[2:55:42.780 --> 2:55:46.780]  and they've got cigarettes in white t-shirts under their arms.
[2:55:46.780 --> 2:55:48.780]  They do a parody of straight people.
[2:55:48.780 --> 2:55:50.780]  And they're wearing blue jeans,
[2:55:50.780 --> 2:55:53.780]  so one girl is like 5'4", and the pretty girl,
[2:55:53.780 --> 2:55:56.780]  and the other girl is like 5'3", 5'4",
[2:55:56.780 --> 2:55:58.780]  and she has a duck's ass haircut,
[2:55:58.780 --> 2:56:01.780]  and they actually walk over and start hitting on Amy,
[2:56:01.780 --> 2:56:03.780]  and Amy is like a fitness model,
[2:56:03.780 --> 2:56:05.780]  she's like one national championships,
[2:56:05.780 --> 2:56:07.780]  and Amy starts laughing at him,
[2:56:07.780 --> 2:56:08.780]  and these women go,
[2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:11.780]  God, a problem to Shane, who I've witnessed,
[2:56:11.780 --> 2:56:13.780]  we wasn't even showing off, you know,
[2:56:13.780 --> 2:56:16.780]  he's not shooting 45s into his pool with a silencer.
[2:56:16.780 --> 2:56:21.780]  He literally can bench press 400 pounds 25 times.
[2:56:21.780 --> 2:56:22.780]  He's a beast.
[2:56:22.780 --> 2:56:23.780]  He's a beast.
[2:56:23.780 --> 2:56:24.780]  I mean, he trains, you know,
[2:56:24.780 --> 2:56:27.780]  he eats sometimes Tim Kennedy, that's what they train in grappling.
[2:56:27.780 --> 2:56:28.780]  So this guy literally,
[2:56:28.780 --> 2:56:30.780]  like all these people try to come compete with him,
[2:56:30.780 --> 2:56:32.780]  and they can't go as long as he can.
[2:56:32.780 --> 2:56:34.780]  So he's like the real deal, genetic, super freak.
[2:56:34.780 --> 2:56:38.780]  And these women try to start a fight with him.
[2:56:38.780 --> 2:56:41.780]  I'm literally, and Amy started laughing.
[2:56:41.780 --> 2:56:43.780]  There's same starters like Conan the Barbarian,
[2:56:43.780 --> 2:56:44.780]  what he wanted to look like.
[2:56:44.780 --> 2:56:46.780]  He looks better than Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime,
[2:56:46.780 --> 2:56:48.780]  and these women are literally trying to start a fight with him
[2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:50.780]  in some weird ritual, like you said,
[2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:51.780]  like they believe these movies,
[2:56:51.780 --> 2:56:53.780]  they're dealing with it, it would rip your face off.
[2:56:53.780 --> 2:56:55.780]  Feminism hasn't glorified women.
[2:56:55.780 --> 2:56:58.780]  They look down on housewives as sell-outs.
[2:56:58.780 --> 2:57:01.780]  This little short chick was bossing the other one around,
[2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:03.780]  like they think, like smashing them, you know.
[2:57:03.780 --> 2:57:05.780]  What they've done is they've turned women into men,
[2:57:05.780 --> 2:57:07.780]  and women make crappy men.
[2:57:07.780 --> 2:57:09.780]  Sorry, ladies, you're not good at being us.
[2:57:09.780 --> 2:57:12.780]  We're a different gender in case you haven't checked.
[2:57:12.780 --> 2:57:15.780]  So now they're like, we're not men compared to Shane Steiner.
[2:57:15.780 --> 2:57:17.780]  Yeah, I mean, it's like, this is like the alpha male.
[2:57:17.780 --> 2:57:18.780]  Yes.
[2:57:18.780 --> 2:57:21.780]  So they go out and they see these movies and then they go,
[2:57:21.780 --> 2:57:23.780]  I'm a badass, and they go to rallies,
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:25.780]  like in the Rufial shot where that guy gets knocked out,
[2:57:25.780 --> 2:57:27.780]  you see this 100-pound girl going up to him,
[2:57:27.780 --> 2:57:28.780]  like, what now?
[2:57:28.780 --> 2:57:30.780]  And they act kind of like black.
[2:57:30.780 --> 2:57:31.780]  Oh, let's show that we come back.
[2:57:31.780 --> 2:57:33.780]  And then she starts punching the dude.
[2:57:33.780 --> 2:57:34.780]  Yeah, she's right outside.
[2:57:34.780 --> 2:57:35.780]  Yo, what's up?
[2:57:35.780 --> 2:57:37.780]  And you're like, lady, please come down.
[2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:39.780]  You ain't in Hollywood now, baby.
[2:57:39.780 --> 2:58:02.780]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:58:10.780 --> 2:58:13.780]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[2:58:13.780 --> 2:58:14.780]  for over a year.
[2:58:14.780 --> 2:58:17.780]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:20.780]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:22.780]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[2:58:22.780 --> 2:58:25.780]  and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[2:58:25.780 --> 2:58:28.780]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[2:58:28.780 --> 2:58:32.780]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[2:58:32.780 --> 2:58:35.780]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[2:58:35.780 --> 2:58:37.780]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:58:37.780 --> 2:58:39.780]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field
[2:58:39.780 --> 2:59:08.780]  and InfoWarsLive.com.
[2:59:09.780 --> 2:59:11.780]  I'm not going to go back to the world from the break,
[2:59:11.780 --> 2:59:14.780]  but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[2:59:14.780 --> 2:59:17.780]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[2:59:17.780 --> 2:59:20.780]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[2:59:20.780 --> 2:59:21.780]  I want to keep going.
[2:59:21.780 --> 2:59:25.780]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[2:59:25.780 --> 2:59:27.780]  I want to push all the way.
[2:59:27.780 --> 2:59:28.780]  I've committed to do that.
[2:59:28.780 --> 2:59:31.780]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen,
[2:59:31.780 --> 2:59:34.780]  but you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[2:59:34.780 --> 2:59:35.780]  I will never falter.
[2:59:35.780 --> 2:59:37.780]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[2:59:37.780 --> 2:59:39.780]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment
[2:59:39.780 --> 2:59:42.780]  if you financially support us at VoWarsLive.com
[2:59:42.780 --> 2:59:48.780]  to give you my absolute total commitment.
[2:59:48.780 --> 3:00:13.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:13.780 --> 3:00:14.780]  We'll have a little bit more here in a second.
[3:00:14.780 --> 3:00:16.780]  Michael, you know where he's trafficking.
[3:00:16.780 --> 3:00:19.780]  He's trafficking in this part of the Republican base.
[3:00:19.780 --> 3:00:21.780]  It's not fair to call it the Republican base,
[3:00:21.780 --> 3:00:24.780]  although that's what it is now, but I think it's fair to you.
[3:00:24.780 --> 3:00:25.780]  Trump voters.
[3:00:25.780 --> 3:00:26.780]  Trump voters.
[3:00:26.780 --> 3:00:29.780]  He's trafficking in their conspiracies,
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:34.780]  and he talked to Antifa, an issue in Portland, Oregon.
[3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:38.780]  I will grant you that, but this is not a giant issue.
[3:00:38.780 --> 3:00:41.780]  This reminds me a lot of his initial reaction to Charlottesville.
[3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:44.780]  This desire to talk about violence on the left
[3:00:44.780 --> 3:00:48.780]  as somehow equal to or perhaps greater than violence on the right.
[3:00:48.780 --> 3:00:50.780]  Or to rationalize violence.
[3:00:50.780 --> 3:00:53.780]  I think he just wants to rationalize violence.
[3:00:53.780 --> 3:01:01.780]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the N-word?
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:04.780]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans
[3:01:04.780 --> 3:01:06.780]  and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[3:01:06.780 --> 3:01:09.780]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[3:01:09.780 --> 3:01:14.780]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[3:01:14.780 --> 3:01:17.780]  I wouldn't support that group, would you?
[3:01:17.780 --> 3:01:22.780]  This has been a public service announcement from Infowars.com.
[3:01:22.780 --> 3:01:49.780]  Antifa!
[3:01:49.780 --> 3:02:03.780]  If you're a TV viewer, you saw it. Radio Lister's missed it.
[3:02:03.780 --> 3:02:04.780]  Just footage.
[3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:06.780]  I mean, there's some more in DC where the woman's like beating the guy in the face,
[3:02:06.780 --> 3:02:08.780]  and finally gets her back.
[3:02:08.780 --> 3:02:10.780]  This is all part of this brainwashing.
[3:02:10.780 --> 3:02:11.780]  It's like larping.
[3:02:11.780 --> 3:02:12.780]  Now, that's not DC.
[3:02:12.780 --> 3:02:13.780]  It's a larger, blonde-er chick.
[3:02:13.780 --> 3:02:14.780]  She's hitting the guy.
[3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:15.780]  Right.
[3:02:15.780 --> 3:02:16.780]  Well, that was Goldie Locke's.
[3:02:16.780 --> 3:02:17.780]  I forget what they call her.
[3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:20.780]  But she had tweeted out before she went there.
[3:02:20.780 --> 3:02:21.780]  What was she called?
[3:02:21.780 --> 3:02:23.780]  Oh, Moldy Locke.
[3:02:23.780 --> 3:02:24.780]  Yeah, that was it.
[3:02:24.780 --> 3:02:25.780]  She had tweeted out before that,
[3:02:25.780 --> 3:02:27.780]  I'm going to go get some Nazi scalps.
[3:02:27.780 --> 3:02:31.780]  Now, that guy, I think that's Nathan Domingo.
[3:02:31.780 --> 3:02:32.780]  He is an alt-right dude.
[3:02:32.780 --> 3:02:36.780]  I don't want my sister going to fight Nazis.
[3:02:36.780 --> 3:02:40.780]  Yeah, but pull up the one in DC where a few people and the one guy saying,
[3:02:40.780 --> 3:02:42.780]  hold back, hold back, let her hit you,
[3:02:42.780 --> 3:02:44.780]  and then she keeps hitting the guy over and over again,
[3:02:44.780 --> 3:02:45.780]  and he finally clocks her.
[3:02:45.780 --> 3:02:47.780]  We showed it earlier today, guys.
[3:02:47.780 --> 3:02:48.780]  Remember when we were young men?
[3:02:48.780 --> 3:02:50.780]  You never hit a chick.
[3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:51.780]  Women didn't fight.
[3:02:51.780 --> 3:02:53.780]  It wasn't part of their vernacular.
[3:02:53.780 --> 3:02:55.780]  Oh, but when I tried to get into Trump's inauguration,
[3:02:55.780 --> 3:02:57.780]  when I tried to get into there,
[3:02:57.780 --> 3:03:00.780]  it was women up front with anti-foot behind them trying to block you,
[3:03:00.780 --> 3:03:02.780]  so it looked like you were attacking a woman.
[3:03:02.780 --> 3:03:04.780]  You'd like, excuse me, and they'd hit you.
[3:03:04.780 --> 3:03:06.780]  And then they'd scream, you just hit a woman.
[3:03:06.780 --> 3:03:07.780]  I can't tell you.
[3:03:07.780 --> 3:03:08.780]  You had a mask on.
[3:03:08.780 --> 3:03:09.780]  What are you doing at a brawl?
[3:03:09.780 --> 3:03:11.780]  You know, in the 50s, the rumble seats,
[3:03:11.780 --> 3:03:14.780]  and they'd go have a big rumble with chains and stuff?
[3:03:14.780 --> 3:03:17.780]  Women were at the sock hop with the poodle skirts.
[3:03:17.780 --> 3:03:18.780]  They weren't going there.
[3:03:18.780 --> 3:03:20.780]  Hey, guys, give me a favor.
[3:03:20.780 --> 3:03:21.780]  I'm not telepathic.
[3:03:21.780 --> 3:03:23.780]  I can't see the calls in there.
[3:03:23.780 --> 3:03:25.780]  So just put the calls up here on screen for me right here.
[3:03:25.780 --> 3:03:26.780]  That's awesome.
[3:03:26.780 --> 3:03:27.780]  Thanks a lot.
[3:03:27.780 --> 3:03:28.780]  I appreciate that.
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:29.780]  OK, we're going to go to break.
[3:03:29.780 --> 3:03:31.780]  We're going to take two segments of calls.
[3:03:31.780 --> 3:03:33.780]  The Hagmonds know every once in a while I pre-empt.
[3:03:33.780 --> 3:03:34.780]  Then you get a 30-minute break we're going to meet,
[3:03:34.780 --> 3:03:35.780]  and you're going to go back on the worm,
[3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:36.780]  and then you're going to get out of here.
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:39.780]  But we've got Gavin McGinnis here with us.
[3:03:39.780 --> 3:03:41.780]  Tell folks briefly about the fundraiser.
[3:03:41.780 --> 3:03:42.780]  You're not involved.
[3:03:42.780 --> 3:03:46.780]  You're right to the guys attacked by the anti-professors,
[3:03:46.780 --> 3:03:47.780]  and the police supported them,
[3:03:47.780 --> 3:03:49.780]  and they're not trying to put them in presence.
[3:03:49.780 --> 3:03:51.780]  They've got to be defended in New York.
[3:03:51.780 --> 3:03:53.780]  Fundthewest.org.
[3:03:53.780 --> 3:03:56.780]  Nine proud boys are facing serious prison times,
[3:03:56.780 --> 3:04:02.780]  serious charges, and a total of $350,000 of lawyers' fees.
[3:04:02.780 --> 3:04:05.780]  And this is because a simple case of self-defense
[3:04:05.780 --> 3:04:09.780]  was totally politicized by the media and the DNC.
[3:04:09.780 --> 3:04:11.780]  These kids were set up.
[3:04:11.780 --> 3:04:12.780]  These are blue-collar guys.
[3:04:12.780 --> 3:04:14.780]  They work in roofing and construction.
[3:04:14.780 --> 3:04:16.780]  They got jumped by Antifa.
[3:04:16.780 --> 3:04:20.780]  They fought back, and God forbid they won.
[3:04:20.780 --> 3:04:21.780]  Sorry.
[3:04:21.780 --> 3:04:22.780]  Sorry someone defended them.
[3:04:22.780 --> 3:04:24.780]  And it's on video they got it set.
[3:04:24.780 --> 3:04:26.780]  That's the craziest part of this whole thing.
[3:04:26.780 --> 3:04:28.780]  We've been playing just the fight that was 20 seconds.
[3:04:28.780 --> 3:04:29.780]  There's them coming to the event,
[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:31.780]  going F.U. and trying to, and like,
[3:04:31.780 --> 3:04:34.780]  strutting up and everything, and it's all there.
[3:04:34.780 --> 3:04:35.780]  They come looking for a fight.
[3:04:35.780 --> 3:04:37.780]  They attack, and the crime is,
[3:04:37.780 --> 3:04:39.780]  you're supposed to just bat on it and say,
[3:04:39.780 --> 3:04:41.780]  yes, Method. Yes, Method.
[3:04:41.780 --> 3:04:43.780]  Beat me up, Method.
[3:04:43.780 --> 3:04:46.780]  I mean, my God, boys, you're in the wrong department,
[3:04:46.780 --> 3:04:48.780]  you little Methods, and it gets your asses handed to you.
[3:04:48.780 --> 3:05:10.780]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[3:05:18.780 --> 3:05:20.780]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[3:05:48.780 --> 3:05:50.780]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[3:05:50.780 --> 3:06:19.780]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[3:06:19.780 --> 3:06:21.780]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[3:06:50.780 --> 3:06:52.780]  They try to make it look separate, right?
[3:06:52.780 --> 3:06:53.780]  Oh, Twitter banned you.
[3:06:53.780 --> 3:06:55.780]  Oh, this guy called you Nazi.
[3:06:55.780 --> 3:06:58.780]  But when we, and I think it's time to start suing
[3:06:58.780 --> 3:07:04.780]  the SPLC, Google, Twitter, and get discovery.
[3:07:04.780 --> 3:07:07.780]  Because when we get discovery, we start seeing meetings.
[3:07:07.780 --> 3:07:10.780]  We start seeing emails, and they start saying things
[3:07:10.780 --> 3:07:12.780]  like we've been talking about this whole show.
[3:07:12.780 --> 3:07:13.780]  They're such criminals.
[3:07:13.780 --> 3:07:15.780]  We have a thousand articles about you at the same time.
[3:07:15.780 --> 3:07:17.780]  That means that was planned.
[3:07:17.780 --> 3:07:19.780]  They publish the same minute, which means they all agree.
[3:07:19.780 --> 3:07:21.780]  So they don't all listen.
[3:07:21.780 --> 3:07:22.780]  It's like, I don't know.
[3:07:22.780 --> 3:07:23.780]  You don't break it first.
[3:07:23.780 --> 3:07:24.780]  Yes.
[3:07:24.780 --> 3:07:26.780]  So you just kind of handed it to who you're suing.
[3:07:26.780 --> 3:07:27.780]  You just handed it to who you're suing.
[3:07:27.780 --> 3:07:28.780]  Yeah.
[3:07:28.780 --> 3:07:30.780]  Well, there's going to be a lot of John Doe's in there.
[3:07:30.780 --> 3:07:34.780]  But there has to be SPLC, ADL, Google.
[3:07:34.780 --> 3:07:37.780]  They all need to get into the court system.
[3:07:37.780 --> 3:07:39.780]  We need to drag them into the court system
[3:07:39.780 --> 3:07:42.780]  so we can see evidence of them planning these
[3:07:42.780 --> 3:07:43.780]  coordinated attacks.
[3:07:43.780 --> 3:07:46.780]  Because it's a concerted effort to smear a problem.
[3:07:46.780 --> 3:07:49.780]  They're so belligerent and such liars
[3:07:49.780 --> 3:07:51.780]  that they get up there and lie about things
[3:07:51.780 --> 3:07:52.780]  that are admitted fact.
[3:07:52.780 --> 3:07:54.780]  Like, we don't track you when you turn it off,
[3:07:54.780 --> 3:07:55.780]  even though they admit they do.
[3:07:55.780 --> 3:07:57.780]  You just can't use the function.
[3:07:57.780 --> 3:08:00.780]  So we also need to have them prosecuted for lying.
[3:08:00.780 --> 3:08:01.780]  Yes.
[3:08:01.780 --> 3:08:03.780]  I mean, they've got more power than NSA.
[3:08:03.780 --> 3:08:04.780]  And now they're allied with the left.
[3:08:04.780 --> 3:08:06.780]  And you know, they're filling all the tech companies
[3:08:06.780 --> 3:08:07.780]  with the SJWs.
[3:08:07.780 --> 3:08:10.780]  They have a contract with the SPLC and Soros.
[3:08:10.780 --> 3:08:12.780]  So they put their people in charge,
[3:08:12.780 --> 3:08:13.780]  and they have your personal data.
[3:08:13.780 --> 3:08:14.780]  How creepy is that?
[3:08:14.780 --> 3:08:15.780]  Well, I think what's happened is...
[3:08:15.780 --> 3:08:16.780]  I'm going to say it again.
[3:08:16.780 --> 3:08:18.780]  The Democratic Party has your data.
[3:08:18.780 --> 3:08:21.780]  The Democratic Party has their little political officers.
[3:08:21.780 --> 3:08:24.780]  The Google's moving into the former Stasi building
[3:08:24.780 --> 3:08:26.780]  in East Berlin.
[3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:29.780]  We're living in a country where you...
[3:08:29.780 --> 3:08:31.780]  Everyone is using these encrypted apps now
[3:08:31.780 --> 3:08:33.780]  to communicate because they're so scared
[3:08:33.780 --> 3:08:34.780]  of being spied on.
[3:08:34.780 --> 3:08:35.780]  It's Stalinist.
[3:08:35.780 --> 3:08:37.780]  How many times have you seen someone with their computer
[3:08:37.780 --> 3:08:39.780]  with a little bit of tape over the camera?
[3:08:39.780 --> 3:08:40.780]  What is this?
[3:08:40.780 --> 3:08:42.780]  Czechoslovakia under Stalin?
[3:08:42.780 --> 3:08:43.780]  How did we get here?
[3:08:43.780 --> 3:08:46.780]  Well, you launched the whole hipster movement,
[3:08:46.780 --> 3:08:48.780]  and then it's a monster you hate, but...
[3:08:48.780 --> 3:08:49.780]  I mean, I launched...
[3:08:49.780 --> 3:08:51.780]  It was in documentaries 18 years ago
[3:08:51.780 --> 3:08:53.780]  that I had a cover over WebTips.
[3:08:53.780 --> 3:08:55.780]  And then now Comey says he does it.
[3:08:55.780 --> 3:08:56.780]  Zuckerberg does it.
[3:08:56.780 --> 3:08:57.780]  Yeah.
[3:08:57.780 --> 3:08:59.780]  Well, of course.
[3:08:59.780 --> 3:09:01.780]  Because that's what they're doing to you.
[3:09:01.780 --> 3:09:02.780]  Hell, you...
[3:09:02.780 --> 3:09:04.780]  What about taking these devices into your house,
[3:09:04.780 --> 3:09:06.780]  like the Alexa and the Google Assist?
[3:09:06.780 --> 3:09:07.780]  They admit they're watching.
[3:09:07.780 --> 3:09:10.780]  Oh, I'm at the point now where I talk to the FBI
[3:09:10.780 --> 3:09:11.780]  when I talk to people.
[3:09:11.780 --> 3:09:14.780]  Because all the lawyers in the Proud Boys case say,
[3:09:14.780 --> 3:09:15.780]  Call me on a burner phone.
[3:09:15.780 --> 3:09:17.780]  I don't want you talking about the case to me
[3:09:17.780 --> 3:09:18.780]  because your phone's tapped.
[3:09:18.780 --> 3:09:20.780]  So when I'm on my phone, I go,
[3:09:20.780 --> 3:09:22.780]  Hey, FBI, surely you're seeing at this point
[3:09:22.780 --> 3:09:24.780]  that I'm a pretty good guy, right?
[3:09:24.780 --> 3:09:25.780]  You don't get it.
[3:09:25.780 --> 3:09:26.780]  Are you starting to like me?
[3:09:26.780 --> 3:09:27.780]  You're not listening.
[3:09:27.780 --> 3:09:28.780]  There's a lot of good jokes going back and forth here.
[3:09:28.780 --> 3:09:29.780]  Do you think I'm funny at least?
[3:09:29.780 --> 3:09:30.780]  You're not listening.
[3:09:30.780 --> 3:09:31.780]  You're not listening, Gavin.
[3:09:31.780 --> 3:09:33.780]  These are social climbers.
[3:09:33.780 --> 3:09:36.780]  They have eight different CIAs.
[3:09:36.780 --> 3:09:39.780]  There's 18 different intelligence agencies.
[3:09:39.780 --> 3:09:41.780]  The FBI is probably five groups.
[3:09:41.780 --> 3:09:43.780]  Most of the FBI are dealing with kidnappings
[3:09:43.780 --> 3:09:45.780]  and bank robberies and missing kids.
[3:09:45.780 --> 3:09:46.780]  They're good people, good men and women,
[3:09:46.780 --> 3:09:47.780]  or Islamic stuff.
[3:09:47.780 --> 3:09:48.780]  They're not even allowed to go after.
[3:09:48.780 --> 3:09:49.780]  They get probably do.
[3:09:49.780 --> 3:09:52.780]  They have special units like New York, dude,
[3:09:52.780 --> 3:09:55.780]  and other areas that go after you.
[3:09:55.780 --> 3:09:57.780]  They don't care you're a good person.
[3:09:57.780 --> 3:09:59.780]  They hate you because you are.
[3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:00.780]  You understand?
[3:10:00.780 --> 3:10:01.780]  Yeah, good point.
[3:10:01.780 --> 3:10:03.780]  So these are compartmentalized.
[3:10:03.780 --> 3:10:05.780]  They go, oh, you're saying the FBI's a little criminal?
[3:10:05.780 --> 3:10:06.780]  No.
[3:10:06.780 --> 3:10:08.780]  It's like Trump said, the 35 angry Democrats
[3:10:08.780 --> 3:10:10.780]  are literally running his persecution.
[3:10:10.780 --> 3:10:11.780]  It's a cabal, dude.
[3:10:11.780 --> 3:10:13.780]  It's a clit.
[3:10:13.780 --> 3:10:14.780]  It's a gang.
[3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:16.780]  We're going to phone calls right now.
[3:10:16.780 --> 3:10:17.780]  You're great Americans for holding.
[3:10:17.780 --> 3:10:19.780]  Thomas Payne, the great state of Texas.
[3:10:19.780 --> 3:10:21.780]  You're on the air with Gavin McKinnis.
[3:10:21.780 --> 3:10:22.780]  Go ahead.
[3:10:22.780 --> 3:10:24.780]  Gavin, proud of your boy.
[3:10:24.780 --> 3:10:25.780]  Proud of your boy.
[3:10:25.780 --> 3:10:27.780]  Gavin, I just want to say,
[3:10:27.780 --> 3:10:29.780]  I won't take up too much of your time,
[3:10:29.780 --> 3:10:31.780]  but Alex is preaching wisdom here, brother,
[3:10:31.780 --> 3:10:33.780]  and we need to be listening to him.
[3:10:33.780 --> 3:10:36.780]  We don't need to be hiding in the shadows.
[3:10:36.780 --> 3:10:38.780]  Even these liberals, they,
[3:10:38.780 --> 3:10:41.780]  everything they touch just turns to stone.
[3:10:41.780 --> 3:10:44.780]  They kill and destroy everything right now.
[3:10:44.780 --> 3:10:46.780]  Proud boys and other brothers,
[3:10:46.780 --> 3:10:48.780]  we don't need to be hiding out in the shadows,
[3:10:48.780 --> 3:10:49.780]  waiting in the weeds.
[3:10:49.780 --> 3:10:52.780]  And it looks like we're capitulating to the left.
[3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:55.780]  Everything we're doing because we're not out,
[3:10:55.780 --> 3:10:57.780]  you know, promoting our charities,
[3:10:57.780 --> 3:10:59.780]  getting out to events because everybody's scared
[3:10:59.780 --> 3:11:01.780]  to be seen with what we're doing.
[3:11:01.780 --> 3:11:02.780]  Our chapters are wild.
[3:11:02.780 --> 3:11:03.780]  You notice how the side work.
[3:11:03.780 --> 3:11:04.780]  Gavin's not bad.
[3:11:04.780 --> 3:11:06.780]  Hey, say the group's not good.
[3:11:06.780 --> 3:11:07.780]  Say you're standing down.
[3:11:07.780 --> 3:11:08.780]  We'll go good on your guys.
[3:11:08.780 --> 3:11:10.780]  And then they see the weakness.
[3:11:10.780 --> 3:11:12.780]  They come in, they shut him down
[3:11:12.780 --> 3:11:13.780]  so they can really set you up.
[3:11:13.780 --> 3:11:14.780]  And now you...
[3:11:14.780 --> 3:11:16.780]  Yeah, well, Thomas brings up a good point.
[3:11:16.780 --> 3:11:17.780]  We don't want violence,
[3:11:17.780 --> 3:11:18.780]  so all proud boys have been avoiding
[3:11:18.780 --> 3:11:21.780]  doing any kind of rallies or charity work.
[3:11:21.780 --> 3:11:22.780]  They don't want to do charity work
[3:11:22.780 --> 3:11:23.780]  because they know there'll be a fight
[3:11:23.780 --> 3:11:25.780]  and then it'll hurt the NYC nine.
[3:11:25.780 --> 3:11:28.780]  But you can't let the enemy take us off the streets.
[3:11:28.780 --> 3:11:29.780]  We just say, this is BS.
[3:11:29.780 --> 3:11:30.780]  They attacked us.
[3:11:30.780 --> 3:11:32.780]  It's bull and attack.
[3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:34.780]  Believe me, the only reason I'm still here
[3:11:34.780 --> 3:11:36.780]  and the few times I didn't attack
[3:11:36.780 --> 3:11:37.780]  is all of our problems.
[3:11:37.780 --> 3:11:38.780]  We're in the right.
[3:11:38.780 --> 3:11:39.780]  Leave it up to God.
[3:11:39.780 --> 3:11:40.780]  Yes.
[3:11:40.780 --> 3:11:41.780]  Attack.
[3:11:41.780 --> 3:11:42.780]  Here's the million dollar question.
[3:11:42.780 --> 3:11:44.780]  So the commies always ruin everything
[3:11:44.780 --> 3:11:45.780]  and then people get mad
[3:11:45.780 --> 3:11:46.780]  and then they elect someone
[3:11:46.780 --> 3:11:48.780]  super far right to fix the problem.
[3:11:48.780 --> 3:11:49.780]  Like we're seeing in Italy now.
[3:11:49.780 --> 3:11:50.780]  We're seeing it all over Europe.
[3:11:50.780 --> 3:11:52.780]  We saw with Brexit.
[3:11:52.780 --> 3:11:55.780]  But sometimes the bad guys win
[3:11:55.780 --> 3:11:56.780]  and there's no fight back.
[3:11:56.780 --> 3:11:57.780]  Like look at Iran.
[3:11:57.780 --> 3:12:00.780]  It never recovered from the Revolution in 1979.
[3:12:00.780 --> 3:12:01.780]  Look at Russia.
[3:12:01.780 --> 3:12:02.780]  It's not.
[3:12:02.780 --> 3:12:04.780]  It didn't bounce back from the commies.
[3:12:04.780 --> 3:12:05.780]  They stayed communist.
[3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:08.780]  So it's likely that we will eventually win
[3:12:08.780 --> 3:12:09.780]  and have truth and justice.
[3:12:09.780 --> 3:12:11.780]  But there's also a possibility
[3:12:11.780 --> 3:12:12.780]  that this place becomes
[3:12:12.780 --> 3:12:13.780]  We're going to win.
[3:12:13.780 --> 3:12:14.780]  Venezuela.
[3:12:14.780 --> 3:12:16.780]  Because we're the real liberals.
[3:12:16.780 --> 3:12:17.780]  Yeah.
[3:12:17.780 --> 3:12:19.780]  And people think you're a liberal.
[3:12:19.780 --> 3:12:20.780]  Yeah.
[3:12:20.780 --> 3:12:21.780]  More guns.
[3:12:21.780 --> 3:12:22.780]  More freedom.
[3:12:22.780 --> 3:12:23.780]  More.
[3:12:23.780 --> 3:12:24.780]  More.
[3:12:24.780 --> 3:12:25.780]  More.
[3:12:25.780 --> 3:12:26.780]  I mean, I run my damn life.
[3:12:26.780 --> 3:12:27.780]  I don't hurt you.
[3:12:27.780 --> 3:12:28.780]  I don't want to commit suicide.
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:29.780]  I'll never commit suicide.
[3:12:29.780 --> 3:12:32.780]  I got this far.
[3:12:32.780 --> 3:12:34.780]  Cause man, Man, somebody don't know
[3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:35.780]  what the hell you got into.
[3:12:35.780 --> 3:12:36.780]  I'm into freedom.
[3:12:36.780 --> 3:12:37.780]  So get used to it.
[3:12:37.780 --> 3:12:38.780]  To control rates.
[3:12:38.780 --> 3:12:39.780]  Can't deal with it.
[3:12:39.780 --> 3:12:40.780]  Thomas.
[3:12:40.780 --> 3:12:41.780]  Anything else.
[3:12:41.780 --> 3:12:43.780]  I just just want to say that I am.
[3:12:43.780 --> 3:12:43.780]  The proudest of proud boys.
[3:12:43.780 --> 3:12:44.780]  I am the proudest of proud boys.
[3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:45.780]  I'll tell you.
[3:12:45.780 --> 3:12:46.780]  We promote America.
[3:12:46.780 --> 3:12:52.780]  We promote charity.
[3:12:52.780 --> 3:12:54.780]  We put our disabled veterans.
[3:12:54.780 --> 3:12:56.780]  Our homeless women and children above ourselves.
[3:12:56.780 --> 3:12:57.780]  That's who we put our charity.
[3:12:57.780 --> 3:12:58.780]  We number our charities.
[3:12:58.780 --> 3:13:01.240]  That's what Proud Boys are about.
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:05.160]  They're about putting ourselves behind the people who need it more.
[3:13:05.160 --> 3:13:08.680]  And that's what we need to get out in the face of people and show them what we're all
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:09.680]  about.
[3:13:09.680 --> 3:13:10.680]  I agree with Thomas.
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:11.680]  You know the little secret.
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:14.080]  That what you're doing only makes you stronger.
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:15.080]  So they hate that.
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:16.280]  This is what men are supposed to do.
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:18.960]  We went, we were down in Texas for the hurricane.
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:19.960]  Was it Hurricane Harvey?
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:20.960]  That's right.
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:22.440]  And hanging out, handing out water.
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:27.240]  Oh, they're so scared of fraternity of men that's in close to the law groups standing
[3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:28.240]  up.
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:31.160]  The methods are scared that men showed up.
[3:13:31.160 --> 3:13:33.640]  And so there was a group photo and they had guns.
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:35.640]  You need guns when there's a hurricane going on.
[3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:36.640]  There's danger there.
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:37.640]  It's a dangerous environment.
[3:13:37.640 --> 3:13:39.140]  Yeah, there's crocodiles.
[3:13:39.140 --> 3:13:43.960]  The story of the problem is that the Proud Boys went down to Texas to hunt looters.
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:46.560]  And you don't really piss me off about that.
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:51.160]  This is someone sitting on their ass on their couch texting about someone who got in a car
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:54.360]  and went in to a hurricane to help people.
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:55.360]  So you're not doing anything.
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:13:56.720]  I'm not talking to you, Thomas.
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:13:57.720]  The people criticizing.
[3:13:57.720 --> 3:13:59.000]  You're not doing anything.
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:03.880]  You're sitting on your couch and you're criticizing people who are out there trying to save lives.
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:08.240]  And it goes back to the thing I've always said, the less you accomplish, the more you
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:11.160]  trivialize other people's accomplishments.
[3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:16.440]  These people are mentally obese and they see other people out there trying to do good.
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:18.040]  And they go, you're a bitch.
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:19.040]  You're a Nazi.
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:20.040]  Thomas, that's a great point.
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:21.040]  God bless you.
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:22.040]  Great point there.
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:25.720]  I remember being 18 out of high school and my parents moved another house.
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:28.320]  It wasn't as big as the house they had.
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:33.200]  And my mom had bought some oriental rugs and she's sitting there to my dad.
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:34.200]  Yeah.
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:35.200]  I moved this year.
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:36.200]  I moved it there.
[3:14:36.200 --> 3:14:38.560]  And I said, mom, I think these look stupid.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:41.280]  She goes, David, get him out of here by this weekend.
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:42.280]  And I was thrown out that week.
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:43.280]  My mom was really nice too.
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:45.640]  It was like, it's time to go.
[3:14:45.640 --> 3:14:46.640]  She gave the order.
[3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:47.640]  I was gone.
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:49.560]  And it wasn't like my mom was in charge of everything.
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:52.760]  It was just the fact that it was like that genetic thing, like the mother says kick the
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:53.760]  son out.
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:54.760]  He's gone.
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:58.800]  I'm literally telling her what color washing machine she could get because I wasn't running
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:14:59.800]  my own life.
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:04.320]  And that was the, she would put up with me being in jail or fighting or being an A-hole.
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:09.160]  But when I started telling her what the house should look like, it was like, dude, she goes,
[3:15:09.160 --> 3:15:10.160]  David, he needs to move out.
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:11.160]  He's his own life.
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:12.160]  That could be in a nature documentary.
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:16.640]  Like the mama grizzly bear sees the cubs say those carpets look stupid.
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:20.120]  And then that's when the mama girl knew it was time for the cub to leave.
[3:15:20.120 --> 3:15:23.320]  I did bring in the girlfriend that she didn't like.
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:25.120]  And who'd hit on my dad once in front of her.
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:26.120]  Whoa.
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:27.120]  This girl was amazing.
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:28.120]  But she didn't like her.
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:29.120]  That's balls.
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:30.120]  Yeah.
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:31.120]  It's like, yeah.
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:33.120]  So that was a bad thing.
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:36.360]  So that was also a little icy on the cake, but that was a little, well, how do you get
[3:15:36.360 --> 3:15:37.680]  thrown out of the house when you're 18?
[3:15:37.680 --> 3:15:40.000]  Bring your girlfriend over the hits on your dad.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.680]  That will get them thrown out quite quickly.

[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:14.920]  the best eye on the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:18.240]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a
[3:18:18.240 --> 3:18:24.160]  supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:29.000]  that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:34.560]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:38.840]  and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:46.880]  forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies

[3:32:18.560 --> 3:32:23.600]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is everyone will get a

[3:32:28.720 --> 3:32:32.720]  of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the

[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:57.680]  segments but what we got here today right now i just want to jump in real quick here with uh
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:01.600]  we got a lot of stuff a lot of things going on of course we've got uh clinton whistleblowers
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:07.120]  set to make explosive allegations here this week three clinton uh foundation whistleblowers
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:12.640]  are going to speak out today uh explosive allegations this according to uh mark meadows
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:19.840]  and uh six thousand pages of evidence from the clinton foundation investigation being uh being
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:24.720]  looked over is this the end of the clinton foundation yeah i think the end i think it's
[3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:29.840]  smelling up and rotting that's just one issue and the other is what's being um uh talked about
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:36.000]  they're going to testify about tax crimes they're going to testify on pay to play schemes and there's
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:41.920]  at least seven examples that can be uh shown to where there were financial contributions
[3:36:41.920 --> 3:36:46.480]  made to the clinton foundation and quid pro quo turnaround favors to those people who made those
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:52.720]  payments uh at least seven examples of that and uh that's just the tip of the iceberg over six
[3:36:52.720 --> 3:36:59.840]  thousand pages of documents to the irs and fbi uh in august of 2017 and that was the one whistleblower
[3:36:59.840 --> 3:37:05.760]  had their house rated by the fbi uh and and they were looking for what we talked about this on our
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:11.280]  show that uh was there something held back were they looking for uh other information that this
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:15.600]  whistleblower had held on to uh that was not turned over because why would they raid the house of a
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:20.160]  whistleblower who turned over the information if the information was already uh accessible by those
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:25.120]  law enforcement agencies so uh some interesting stuff definitely going on with that oh well
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:31.680]  exactly but but consider this too uh the pay to play accusations peter switzer written has written
[3:37:31.680 --> 3:37:36.320]  about this in clinton cash but consider the pay to play allegations that are being levied right
[3:37:36.320 --> 3:37:41.200]  now that people are saying oh that's just conspiracy theory of course ms mbc conspiracy
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:47.360]  central but uh you gotta look at the numbers uh new york post has shown that contributions to
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:53.520]  the clinton foundation consider clinton hillary clinton as secretary of state uh during uh what
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:38:02.000]  that three year for uh period from 2009 uh the clinton foundation just in one year being 2016 2017
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:10.480]  the uh the donations went from uh 62 million 912 thousand 331 dollars in 2016 when of course
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:17.040]  she was still on the uh you know it is still perhaps going to be president to 26 million
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:24.480]  566 thousand 800 and 25 dollars in 2017 but even worse when you look at the numbers and and
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:29.440]  these are undeniable uh the foundation itself and i just want to hit this real quick
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:37.120]  hid 2.3 million dollars in foreign donations 2.3 million in foreign donations from the head of
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:42.640]  the russian government uranian company that had business before hillary's state department that
[3:38:42.640 --> 3:38:49.520]  was approved by sypheus of course and sypheus is uh basically the entire nine uh person panel of
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:56.080]  sypheus compromised by the entire uranium one and other scandals so look the folks this is not
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:03.120]  conspiracy theory this is absolute truth which is why perhaps hillary bill canceled their uh you
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:10.800]  know 13 uh uh city uh high school gymnasium tour but anyway uh half a million dollars that uh
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:16.640]  that uh uh william jefferson clinton bagged for a speech in moscow paid for a crime by a
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:21.920]  criminal uh criminal link bank you've got uh clinton was serving at secretary state i mean
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:28.960]  she was in the office 26 million dollars of their wealth comes from speaking fees by companies
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:34.400]  and organizations that are also major clinton foundation donors look this stuff is ugly to the
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:41.920]  core and uh we're expecting justice needs to be done here on another note i don't know that if you
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:48.880]  saw this but the uh there's been a release of an ig report uh pertaining to the text messages a
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:54.080]  report of investigation recovery of text messages from certain fbi mobile devices i have not had a
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:58.800]  chance to go through this but this is uh documenting the thousands of text messages between peter
[3:39:58.800 --> 3:40:05.200]  strauch and lisa page and many which were said to have been erased and even a report they thought
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:12.640]  whoops they go on to say that the fbi uh the fbi is unable to uh find or recover missing text messages
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:18.160]  from strauch and page uh but they're going to continue to dig but that's a report i just received
[3:40:18.160 --> 3:40:23.520]  or just saw uh here as we were uh waiting to come on air so that'll be interesting to see what comes
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:28.320]  out of that as well it seems like their whole house of cards of the conspiracy against president
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:34.000]  trump the weaponization by the deep state of all the intelligence agencies against president trump
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:39.040]  to fail in the end and now be exposed we're seeing their house of cards collapse and it's really
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:44.240]  interesting to watch yet i am still uh i don't believe we're going to see the perp walks i'm
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:49.760]  very upset that we have not seen charges brought i know it takes a long time to build cases but we
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:54.560]  need to see action on this we need to get a real attorney general in there uh jeff sessions obviously
[3:40:54.560 --> 3:40:59.200]  was a mistake from the beginning he seemed to be more of a protector of the deep state and their
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:04.240]  crimes than one to go after them and expose them but hopefully we see a turnaround with a new
[3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:09.840]  attorney general once uh they are in there uh sworn in but i mean when are we going to see
[3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:14.720]  these criminals held accountable for their crimes you know and you mentioned attorney general and
[3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:22.320]  i hope people understand uh william bar has been implicated now look uh the the the uh well the
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:28.960]  well the verification of this information is a little bit sketchy uh however it's solid enough
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:36.720]  where i would say it's it's uh it's been authenticated william bar as the person to head the ag's
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:43.840]  office had a major role if you if you listen to former cia operative uh agent terry reid and
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:51.280]  his book compromise had a major role in the uh uh guns for drugs i ran contra dealings back in the
[3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:57.200]  80s so and and his name was robert johnson according to terry reid and his book title
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:42:01.760]  compromise so there are things that that are a little bit disturbing on that on that front
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:07.360]  why him and why that position and why now but uh one more thing i want to get into here
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:13.760]  as we got only about 40 seconds here before the break uh the major news on flinn michael flinn
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:19.760]  with respect to the 302s fd 302s we're gonna get to that here momentarily you're listening to info
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:24.720]  wars thug and joe agman sitting in for alex jones info wars don't forget to visit info wars store
[3:42:24.720 --> 3:42:30.880]  info wars store dot com hey do your christmas shopping support free speech support this platform
[3:42:30.880 --> 3:42:56.080]  just do it we need everybody baby right back living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it
[3:42:56.080 --> 3:43:01.760]  really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[3:43:01.760 --> 3:43:08.320]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:14.880]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:21.600]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:27.760]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[3:43:27.760 --> 3:43:33.600]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:40.320]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure
[3:43:40.320 --> 3:43:46.560]  raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[3:43:46.560 --> 3:43:53.440]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it we all
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:58.400]  know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue info wars is proud to

[3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:31.040]  i'm sitting in for alex jones it's me doc hagman

[3:47:42.720 --> 3:47:47.120]  jones um the last segment we're talking about a number of things from the clinton foundation
[3:47:47.120 --> 3:47:55.600]  uh really unraveling and so yeah general fun it's right left off right and but and thanks
[3:47:55.600 --> 3:47:59.280]  joe because you and i've been looking at this and of course there's been a lot of major
[3:47:59.280 --> 3:48:04.160]  revelations here here's in a nutshell let me just give you the outline because i think this is
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:09.680]  extremely important general flint served as national security advisor roughly for 24 days
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:17.280]  during the transition really if you want to call it serving it's man that's perhaps generous but for
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:23.680]  about uh just a little over three weeks and he was interviewed by the fbi two fbi agents
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:31.520]  peter struck and joe penta penta i believe is how you pronounce his name on january 24th of 2017
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:37.920]  just a couple weeks after after uh president trump was sworn in right now what's important about this
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:41.920]  though that we make sure we make this distinction is that flin was told not to have his lawyer with
[3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:47.200]  him and as soon as the fbi agents began to question him he realized he was being ambushed over his
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:53.200]  phone calls to russian ambassador uh kisslyak so he was asked not to bring an attorney which anybody
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:59.840]  who's ever going to talk to the fbi uh you have an attorney present but he was not to bring well
[3:48:59.840 --> 3:49:05.360]  yeah and what what they were what they were doing what the fbi was doing and it was clear in the
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:14.400]  initial fb 302 the 3024 that described them as jovial and animated and jocular and you know
[3:49:14.400 --> 3:49:22.000]  friendly what they were doing was this was a complete setup by the clinton obama cabal
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:26.720]  general flin obviously was set up there's no question about that but but here's what's coming
[3:49:26.720 --> 3:49:33.680]  to light now folks you remember ted stevens does that name ring a bell how about enron how about
[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:39.440]  uh arthur anderson well how about uh former federal prosecutor sydney powell who wrote
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:47.920]  licensed to lie in fact she laid out the andrew weissman pitbull uh creeps on a mission if you
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:54.800]  haven't read that book i suggest you do because of course miller uh his fbi the the the really
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:50:00.240]  the entirety of the intelligence committee is broken down and the abuses are broken down in
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:04.640]  that book that that took place against enron that took place against arthur anderson in particular
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:09.360]  that ruined the company ruined many people's lives and when it turned out it was all for
[3:50:09.360 --> 3:50:15.040]  not and for nothing but but what they did to michael flinn is on january 24th 2017 there was a
[3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:22.240]  meeting uh two fbi agents including the lead agent peter struck went to flinn's office and uh under
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:28.960]  the pretext of just talking to him of course and uh now as michael as a national security advisor he
[3:50:28.960 --> 3:50:34.160]  would have the intern in the transition team he would have caused to speak with sir god kiss liak
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:41.040]  a guy by the way who also appears in a previous hillary clinton foundation issues and as well as
[3:50:41.040 --> 3:50:47.600]  matters uh relating to uranium one but that's another story yeah so go ahead go ahead before we
[3:50:47.600 --> 3:50:51.920]  get i want to make sure that we talk about this this judge solovan and what this means because
[3:50:51.920 --> 3:50:58.640]  during them was this not the same judge that during the manifold uh case he the judge pretty
[3:50:58.640 --> 3:51:04.320]  much gave the prosecutors a verbal lashing about their intent to ruin manifold's life in an effort
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:10.320]  to undermine and get president trump uh to get him to flip on president trump that's the same
[3:51:10.320 --> 3:51:17.920]  judge solovan yeah you know what i'm not 100 certain with respect to which yeah i know the
[3:51:17.920 --> 3:51:23.360]  manifold trial i'm not sure which role he played if any in that in that uh but i do know going back
[3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:30.400]  a little further and that's all of it was was the guy who really berated um uh the weissman and of
[3:51:30.400 --> 3:51:35.840]  course the intelligence committee for for you know ruin there for violating all of the well for
[3:51:35.840 --> 3:51:40.160]  actually doing the same thing that appears to be taking place right now and that's the fact that
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:46.880]  there's exculpatory evidence that's being withheld from him the judge and don't forget this whole
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:53.840]  well okay so just keep that in the back your mind 24th of january 2017 the two fbi agents including
[3:51:53.840 --> 3:52:00.160]  struck of course interview emin solovan or interview uh michael flinn and uh it was on
[3:52:00.160 --> 3:52:08.400]  february 14th um there was a uh 302 apparently that was created on her but uh uh well i'm sorry
[3:52:09.120 --> 3:52:13.520]  on february 14th there was a reference made to a 302 that was created either contemporaneous
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:20.880]  two or shortly after the flinn interview on january 24th however and this is where it gets
[3:52:20.880 --> 3:52:28.240]  really dicey and don't forget comey was fired on uh may 9th of 2017 okay so this is where it gets
[3:52:28.240 --> 3:52:32.160]  really a little bit complicated but not not so much that you can't really you know people can
[3:52:32.160 --> 3:52:38.560]  understand it um in these in the run up to sentencing you know remember the sentencing for
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:45.200]  michael flinn was delayed numerous times right so three times at least at least now we've got
[3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:51.360]  an indication on the sentencing memo that judge emin solovan looked at from miller from this
[3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:57.520]  crossfire hurricane it's going to turn into nothing less than um you know light rain if anything uh
[3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:05.120]  there's a 302 that's dated august 22nd of 2017 some seven months minus a couple of days was
[3:53:05.120 --> 3:53:13.440]  just called even seven months after the interview so what this means is uh when you the initial
[3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:19.360]  interview or the interview with michael flinn was on january 24 2017 no deception detected according
[3:53:19.360 --> 3:53:28.320]  to uh comey's uh uh is testimony right but how in the world could he know that if he was fired in
[3:53:28.320 --> 3:53:36.320]  may and the f uh the 302 was dated in august 2017 august 22nd there's no way he could know it unless
[3:53:36.320 --> 3:53:41.840]  a couple of things happen unless it was privy to something during that time or privy to um
[3:53:41.840 --> 3:53:48.800]  something after his firing which is not likely but the more likely scenario is that the forms the
[3:53:48.800 --> 3:53:55.600]  302s were changed and who changed them when did they change them and why did they change them
[3:53:55.600 --> 3:54:00.640]  that's that's what's and that's what emin solovan judge emin solovan said hey and by the way
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:07.920]  he said uh and to read this blistering statement he said i want the 302s tomorrow meaning friday
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:13.520]  tomorrow by three o'clock and i want them all i want everything that's right so yeah it's it's
[3:54:13.520 --> 3:54:19.360]  pretty interesting how this is working out and will those be you know uh every made public i don't
[3:54:19.360 --> 3:54:24.400]  know that uh that they will but just the fact that what robert miller did uh you know we talk about
[3:54:24.400 --> 3:54:30.160]  them uh you know switching the debate and switch they're ending the russian collusion probe which
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:34.720]  was the whole original mandate of the special prosecutor's mission which usually needs an
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:40.000]  underlying crime to to launch that special prosecutor's position but there was no underlying
[3:54:40.000 --> 3:54:45.600]  crime and i said this on our show and i'll say it here if and when robert miller decides to end
[3:54:45.600 --> 3:54:50.480]  the collusion aspect of the investigation i believe president trump should fire him immediately
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:55.280]  because now he is going outside of the scope of the authority which there really was an authority
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:55:00.160]  to begin with but and taking it to a whole nother level and if there was ever a time that
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:04.400]  president trump would be right in firing robert miller whether he has something to hide or not
[3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:09.040]  it would be when they switch to the scope of the investigation from the original mandate which was
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:15.040]  proving russian in trump campaign collusion well you know and i totally agree and i know you've
[3:55:15.040 --> 3:55:20.000]  been working on this as well that researching this as well but i'll tell you something the new
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:25.520]  meme the new narrative since the crossfire hurricane the russian collusion whatever that means
[3:55:25.520 --> 3:55:30.800]  conspiracy with russians oh my gosh you know since that's gone guess what they're moving they're
[3:55:30.800 --> 3:55:39.840]  looking at potential uh funding by what by middle eastern countries now okay and there's a desperate
[3:55:40.640 --> 3:55:47.200]  there's a desperate it's but yeah go ahead reporting trump at one point wanting to build
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:54.000]  a trump tower in moscow which was never done as some sort of crime or as proof of collusion
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:56:00.640]  him being a business tycoon in the real estate wanting to build trump towers in major cities
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:05.760]  all over the world but they are looking at things like this like oh he planned to build the trump
[3:56:05.760 --> 3:56:11.200]  tower in moscow and trying to use that as evidence but i did see what the what you said the looking
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:16.000]  into the middle eastern countries now and i don't know really what that's about more or if it's just
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:21.200]  a fishing expedition but that's my point this has gone so far beyond the scope of the original
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:28.000]  mandate that the president needs to end this immediately exactly and remember one name
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:34.960]  catherine rummler that's catherine rummler she was the uh as dan bunjino calls her the the fixer for
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:40.400]  obama obama's council that name you're going to be hearing catherine catherine rummler come up more
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:45.040]  and more as this goes way out of control the wheels come off of the miller investigation
[3:56:45.040 --> 3:56:49.120]  in your right this needs to be shut down we've got about what we have less than a minute show
