[00:25.500 --> 00:30.440]  global transmission here's part of a key report we're gonna kick off with the
[00:30.440 --> 00:35.080]  main transmission begins in T-minus five and a half minutes dealing with CNN's
[00:35.080 --> 00:41.160]  horrendous America-hating anti-for-loving personalities they support
[00:41.160 --> 00:45.600]  Antifa a communist organization that openly targets Americans with violence
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.240]  the theme here is I'm done it Donald Trump and I'll protect you from the
[00:50.240 --> 00:54.780]  scary black people and Tifa is widely perceived as an African-American
[00:54.780 --> 00:59.820]  organization and this is just part of the same story of LeBron James and Don
[00:59.820 --> 01:05.480]  Lemon and Maxine Waters and the NFL players UCLA basketball players this is
[01:05.480 --> 01:10.160]  about black versus white we need to call it what it is this is organized
[01:10.160 --> 01:16.160]  premeditated political violence how fast we turned from Sarah Huckabee
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.240]  Sanders being denied from a restaurant to now the left excusing violence on
[01:21.240 --> 01:24.540]  behalf of a journalist no less democracy dies in darkness until it's
[01:24.540 --> 01:28.280]  a conservative journalist their rhetoric fuels violent attacks on
[01:28.280 --> 01:32.520]  immigration officials like the one carried out by Willem Van Spronson in
[01:32.520 --> 01:37.400]  July and the recent shootings at ICE offices in San Antonio, Texas after
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.280]  leftist targeted ICE employees in Florida with threats against their
[01:42.280 --> 01:49.920]  children throughout the country John both and you have kids and you have kids
[01:49.920 --> 01:54.760]  we know everything about you and you won't just be seeing us here who are
[01:54.760 --> 02:01.880]  they this is the most trusted name in news do you remember when Anderson Cooper
[02:01.880 --> 02:06.960]  actually reported on events rather than vomited out rhetoric that creates them
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.400]  whites will will not be the majority I mean that's it's an exciting
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.440]  transformation of the country it's an exciting evolution and you know progress
[02:16.440 --> 02:20.880]  of our country in many different ways but at least Cooper was known for his
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.360]  reporting out in the field anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon are known for
[02:25.360 --> 02:34.720]  their menacing of society Cuomo who recently lost his demeanor on a man
[02:34.720 --> 02:46.420]  that referred to him as Fredo is now attempting to
[02:46.420 --> 02:50.920]  play the victim in a half-hearted apology writing this happens all the time
[02:50.920 --> 02:56.120]  these days often in front of my family but there is a lesson no need to add to
[02:56.120 --> 02:59.600]  the ugliness I should be better than what I oppose
[02:59.600 --> 03:09.440]  what are you drinking there Don? A little Tito soda. Tito soda that's my friend. We love the Tito's. They send me a t-shirt because I talk about it so much.
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.480]  Meanwhile Don Lemon is embroiled in a lawsuit alleging as the New York Post
[03:14.480 --> 03:19.280]  writes a former Hamptons bartender says that Don Lemon assaulted him after the
[03:19.280 --> 03:25.360]  CNN host disgustingly fondled himself at a local watering hole as alleged in his
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.920]  complaint heist 38 told the post Don gets up walks around the bar comes up
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.320]  right up to me and puts his hand down his board shorts he rubs himself
[03:35.320 --> 03:40.120]  aggressively lemon then shoved his index and middle finger in the plaintiffs
[03:40.120 --> 03:44.760]  mustache and under the plaintiff's nose according to Heise suit and he kept
[03:44.760 --> 03:50.400]  saying P or D P or D he said it three or four times I'm like whoa man what the
[03:50.400 --> 03:57.440]  hell he needs to cut him off add to CNN slippery slope CNN political analyst
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.640]  April Ryan's bodyguard brandished what appears to be a weapon while throwing out
[04:02.640 --> 04:17.920]  a videographer that had permission to film her speaking event you're not an
[04:17.920 --> 04:24.400]  ideological opponent of Ms. Ryan when I left the house that day I was a fan of
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.800]  hers I was looking forward to seeing her remarks and you know maybe learning a
[04:27.800 --> 04:32.760]  thing or two since she's been a journalist longer than I have so the press
[04:32.760 --> 04:37.520]  freedom of the press in your opinion this was an attack on our freedoms yes
[04:37.520 --> 04:42.480]  absolutely all in all under the leadership of Jeff Zucker CNN allows this
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.880]  arrogant behavior to fester and leftist propaganda machine to spew its bias
[04:46.880 --> 04:52.160]  hyperbole to anyone in its gaze CNN's ratings have continued deployment down
[04:52.160 --> 04:59.440]  by 38% folks will be right back we're live it's Friday stay with us it's not
[04:59.440 --> 05:03.160]  only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the
[05:03.160 --> 05:06.920]  other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this
[05:06.920 --> 05:10.920]  reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's
[05:10.920 --> 05:14.480]  not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign
[05:14.480 --> 05:18.360]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old-school American
[05:18.360 --> 05:23.000]  1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.400]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the
[05:26.400 --> 05:30.280]  country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like
[05:30.280 --> 05:33.440]  this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now
[05:33.440 --> 05:36.840]  live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[05:36.840 --> 05:40.480]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news
[05:40.480 --> 05:44.600]  it views view a person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[05:44.600 --> 05:48.920]  audience has broken through that the they are the bridge from the founding to
[05:48.920 --> 05:51.920]  the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why
[05:51.920 --> 05:55.720]  there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation
[05:55.720 --> 06:04.840]  lawfare and libel targeting you there are of course those who do not want us to
[06:04.840 --> 06:09.960]  speak just let me think even now orders are being shot into telephones and men
[06:09.960 --> 06:16.840]  with guns will be on their way because while the junction may be used
[06:16.840 --> 06:22.520]  lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are for the
[06:22.520 --> 06:28.200]  means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of truth
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.480]  there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you decided sir
[06:33.480 --> 06:37.120]  you wanted it foolproof you told me every television in longer cruelty and
[06:37.120 --> 06:41.240]  in just intolerance and depression and where once you have the freedom to
[06:41.240 --> 06:46.080]  object and think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of
[06:46.080 --> 06:49.560]  surveillance coercing your conformity and so getting your
[06:49.560 --> 06:54.920]  submachine cameras how did this happen most blame well certainly there are
[06:54.920 --> 06:59.280]  those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but
[06:59.280 --> 07:04.120]  again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a
[07:04.120 --> 07:11.560]  mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror
[07:11.560 --> 07:17.440]  disease there were a myriad of problems inspired to corrupt your reason and
[07:17.440 --> 07:22.360]  rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you
[07:22.360 --> 07:27.240]  turned to the now high chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you border he
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.520]  promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to obedient
[07:31.520 --> 07:38.200]  consent
[07:38.200 --> 07:44.960]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[07:44.960 --> 08:03.920]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war and
[08:03.920 --> 08:08.120]  it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[08:08.120 --> 08:15.400]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you've got one from the
[08:15.400 --> 08:21.960]  front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.840]  welcome my friends welcome and thank you for joining us on this live Friday
[08:34.840 --> 08:42.600]  August 16th 2019 worldwide transmission remember the fact will even exist and

[09:08.800 --> 09:15.880]  creation in all dimensions this is going to be another incredible transmission
[09:15.880 --> 09:26.560]  today we have Greg Coppola who is a senior current Google engineer who's
[09:26.560 --> 09:31.240]  been put on administrative leave since about a month ago he went public about
[09:31.240 --> 09:37.160]  the danger to our election systems posed by Google another big tech giants who
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.200]  are completely out of control he will be joining us in the second hour then
[09:43.200 --> 09:50.720]  Zach Voorhees has flown to New York to meet with colleagues at a major
[09:50.720 --> 09:55.120]  institution obviously but at that and he is going to be trying to join us
[09:55.120 --> 10:02.200]  during a lunch break and he may even be joining us with some of those colleagues
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.120]  and the folks that he's working with are people like professor Robert Epstein
[10:07.120 --> 10:11.520]  that testified to Congress three weeks ago on the fact that Google and Facebook
[10:11.520 --> 10:19.040]  are currently stealing the 2020 election so look for surprise guest as well
[10:19.040 --> 10:25.800]  today I had some very interesting conversations with very interesting
[10:25.800 --> 10:35.280]  individuals last night with mr. Voorhees late into the evening and let me tell
[10:35.280 --> 10:40.720]  you he's only come out with part of what he knows and he made the decision last
[10:40.720 --> 10:45.920]  night to come out with more and I'm gonna leave it at that and see how much
[10:45.920 --> 10:49.800]  he wants to talk about effect I forgot to say this we should just get him and
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.680]  his colleagues on an airplane and whoever else wants to come when they
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.240]  leave New York to Austin Texas we should get them in studio next week put
[10:58.240 --> 11:02.360]  them up the hotels everything and so I was just texting with him right before
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.000]  I went on air in fact there's so much big news happening back when the New York
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.880]  Times still did some journalism and the Washington Post still did some
[11:09.880 --> 11:13.920]  journalism a journalist would spend a month working on one of the things we
[11:13.920 --> 11:19.240]  work on so we got to move fast and it means we make mistakes sometimes but
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.880]  we've proven that nine times out of ten we're dead on and here's the difference
[11:23.880 --> 11:27.600]  we're trying to tell the truth we're not trying to deceive like a lot of the
[11:27.600 --> 11:30.640]  corporate media out there
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.920]  Norm Patis joins us the bottom of the hour he's obviously a nationally known
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.440]  criminal and a defense lawyer first amendment expert lawyer helping us win
[11:42.440 --> 11:49.920]  against unbelievable odds against the fake sandy hook suits in Connecticut he
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.600]  was actually contacted by the ice officer this morning and he may end up
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.200]  representing him but regardless he's seen the videos of what happened in
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.280]  Rhode Island the supposed ice officer running a crowd over no he pulls up
[12:05.280 --> 12:10.720]  around the corner doesn't see him stops they get a rounding and he just simply
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.240]  bumps him at a quarter mile an hour putting his car in gear they're calling
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.200]  it murder they're looking to charge him in Rhode Island he's been told so
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.240]  exclusive info on that will play the video and they just start celebrating
[12:22.240 --> 12:29.480]  they go oh the truck ice murdered us they go I mean attempted murder so just
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.080]  the filming at the mouth no it's ice facilities being shot up all over the
[12:33.080 --> 12:41.240]  country and being firebombed from Texas to Washington State so this rhetoric is
[12:41.240 --> 12:45.200]  going into high gear Senator Rand Paul has talked about it that's coming up and
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.360]  then we have Mike Adams we have Leo Zagami on the number two to the pope
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.800]  now facing trial on the procurement of hundreds of children for industrial
[12:53.800 --> 13:00.440]  level sex rings for blackmail may have heard of that before and we also have
[13:00.440 --> 13:09.000]  Jelen Maxwell the MI6 spies all the evidence we've had in a hamburger place
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  in and out burger in California and the whole thing looks as staged as a
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.200]  $3 bill to me reading a book about the life and death of CIA operatives so she's
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.440]  telling the world somebody drops a dime it's how the tabloids work and then you
[13:25.440 --> 13:30.400]  show up and they do a impromptu photo of how she's a normal person just have
[13:30.400 --> 13:37.000]  on a hamburger but she's telling the world I'm an intelligence operative you
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.520]  better leave me alone we're gonna go to break but first here is this key report
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.960]  of the media being complicit in the cover-up of all of this
[13:49.080 --> 13:54.160]  President Trump has reacted to Epstein's death in what is sadly a very unsurprising
[13:54.160 --> 13:59.000]  way he is spreading a conspiracy theory tying the death of pedophile Jeffrey
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.240]  Epstein in prison to the president's former political rivals the Clintons
[14:03.240 --> 14:06.880]  the president retweeting a theory without evidence that implicates the
[14:06.880 --> 14:11.840]  Clintons and Epstein's death let that sink in this would be like Gerald Ford
[14:11.840 --> 14:16.200]  or Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan claiming that LBJ had Kennedy killed now the
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.280]  president is helping to spread an outrageous full story about Epstein's
[14:20.280 --> 14:24.920]  death being tied to the kintons shortly after Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.240]  his jail cell President Trump retweeted this video from a conservative
[14:29.240 --> 14:34.640]  commentator for some odd reason people that have information on the Clintons
[14:34.640 --> 14:39.560]  end up dead and they usually die from suicide it's the polling I mean there's
[14:39.560 --> 14:44.600]  there's no other way to put it you have the president of the United States
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.720]  retweeting an unfounded conspiracy theory wouldn't pardon me about the
[14:49.720 --> 14:53.640]  look you know with no evidence to back it up about a former president of the
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.600]  United States we have a president now whose Twitter feed is a chief source of
[14:58.600 --> 15:04.680]  disinformation this is another example of our president using this position of
[15:04.680 --> 15:10.400]  public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.920]  theories some extraordinary conspiracy theories conspiracy theories conspiracy
[15:14.920 --> 15:18.720]  theories conspiracy theories conspiracy theories conspiracy theories
[15:18.720 --> 15:24.560]  conspiracy theory untrustworthy and ridiculous baseless conspiracy
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.240]  theories the president of the United States is pushing a dangerous and
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.560]  completely unfounded murder conspiracy theory about his predecessor but do you
[15:33.560 --> 15:37.800]  think it's dangerous what he's doing is dangerous Republican Marco Rubio agrees
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.120]  it's dangerous it's dangerous dangers my middle name dangerously claiming that
[15:42.120 --> 15:46.800]  Epstein was murdered by the Clintons but there is no evidence at all to support
[15:46.800 --> 15:50.720]  the conspiracy theory the president is fueling Marco Rubio says there is
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.080]  evidence Russian bots are now pushing this new conspiracy theory online to
[15:55.080 --> 16:00.840]  further divide America hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the IRS over 40 years

[17:58.000 --> 18:01.280]  let's talk to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.160]  hey Alex yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a
[18:05.160 --> 18:08.480]  lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.280]  almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the neocons are trying
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.160]  desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.200]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[18:20.200 --> 18:23.560]  that's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[18:23.560 --> 18:26.480]  the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a
[18:26.480 --> 18:29.360]  time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want
[18:29.360 --> 18:32.920]  to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[18:32.920 --> 18:36.920]  have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I would
[18:36.920 --> 18:39.960]  love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you
[18:39.960 --> 18:44.960]  down no you've gone into this war you won a lot of battles and there are a lot
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.680]  of people like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.160]  fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show

[19:03.320 --> 19:06.520]  our Republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were
[19:06.520 --> 19:10.600]  close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living that would
[19:10.600 --> 19:14.280]  end up saving the nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned all US
[19:14.280 --> 19:19.680]  farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for
[19:19.680 --> 19:24.240]  the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.640]  our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't
[19:28.640 --> 19:33.080]  gonna back down so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the

[20:23.360 --> 20:29.480]  host let's talk about the latest laughing stock that to the supposed
[20:29.480 --> 20:34.160]  mainstream media has tried to turn Donald Trump into while he was a laughing
[20:34.160 --> 20:38.200]  stock that would never win the presidency and then he was a laughing
[20:38.200 --> 20:41.680]  stock that would never be able to get the economy above a 3% growth rate and
[20:41.680 --> 20:46.360]  he did he was a laughing stock on so many fronts why they said that he couldn't
[20:46.360 --> 20:51.600]  keep the Senate in 2018 he's been the laughing stock on hundreds of points but
[20:51.600 --> 20:56.480]  in every case Trump in the end and the American people end up winning in fact
[20:56.480 --> 20:59.960]  even Stephen Colbert came out last night and said he doesn't want to be part of
[20:59.960 --> 21:03.760]  the resistance in fact he's never been part of it and Trump's winning the
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.160]  American people are seeing the propaganda well the latest laughing stock
[21:07.160 --> 21:11.800]  ladies and gentlemen is that Trump wants to purchase or look into purchasing the
[21:11.800 --> 21:18.320]  biggest island in the world with an estimated 10 trillion dollars of oil
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.520]  and gas on it oh you'd never want to buy that for a few billion bucks Greenland
[21:23.520 --> 21:29.720]  its population is only a few hundred thousand max almost no one lives there
[21:29.720 --> 21:33.960]  the annuit population started moving there in the last 800 years that's the
[21:33.960 --> 21:39.840]  Eskimo folks from North America and if you're a TV viewer you can see Greenland
[21:39.840 --> 21:45.680]  there on the screen why Danish politicians scoff at Trump's reported
[21:45.680 --> 21:50.720]  wish to buy Greenland it must be April Fool's Day but you see Greenland is
[21:50.720 --> 21:55.040]  autonomous yes the Vikings had some small settlements there but it's
[21:55.040 --> 22:00.880]  autonomous and the people of Greenland could vote like Texas voted to become
[22:00.880 --> 22:10.360]  part of the Union and it could become the 51st state you know like Alaska that
[22:10.360 --> 22:17.920]  other terrible horrible purchase we bought that oh those were cooks back then
[22:17.920 --> 22:24.640]  they bought it for almost nothing and it's worth more in long-term profit and
[22:24.640 --> 22:31.800]  and fuel natural resources more than 40 trillion dollars is what it's estimated
[22:31.800 --> 22:36.680]  at oh my goodness what did what did another stupid American president buy
[22:36.680 --> 22:41.520]  it for well we're gonna go ahead and break down all these other stupid
[22:41.520 --> 22:46.680]  horrible purchases for TV and radio viewers right now because it is autonomous
[22:46.680 --> 22:52.280]  we could pay each person 15 20 million dollars and buy it and have a multi
[22:52.280 --> 22:57.200]  thousand percent increase in profit and all the resources the tourism the
[22:57.200 --> 23:01.760]  development which everything is going to be in the Arctic in the future the Arctic
[23:01.760 --> 23:06.160]  ladies and gentlemen it's in the Arctic region it borders the Arctic Ocean and
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.800]  the Atlantic Ocean and again it's tens of trillions just the land it also gets
[23:11.800 --> 23:16.880]  20 miles out all the natural gas oil and all the fish and all the goodies man
[23:16.880 --> 23:20.160]  don't you wish all those other dumb presidents wouldn't have bought stuff as
[23:20.160 --> 23:24.040]  well they were horrible even the American flag looks horrible actually it's the
[23:24.040 --> 23:26.560]  coolest looking flag it says there's something about America we just we're
[23:26.560 --> 23:29.320]  so stupid right everybody wants to move here so let's go through the history
[23:29.320 --> 23:35.320]  here well after we took from the king of England the original 13 colonies by
[23:35.320 --> 23:41.640]  force by conquest by ideas well then there was the Louisiana purchase for
[23:41.640 --> 23:48.840]  15 million dollars the equivalent of about 200 plus million today and as you
[23:48.840 --> 23:54.040]  know the Louisiana purchase is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars what a
[23:54.040 --> 24:01.640]  horrible purchase what a horrible thing that president did back then those were
[24:01.640 --> 24:08.080]  really bad people there was a Louisiana purchase there was of course the Red River
[24:08.080 --> 24:13.200]  Valley purchase again just absolutely got it for nothing then there was the
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.480]  Florida purchase for five million dollars oh my gosh Florida for five
[24:17.480 --> 24:22.920]  million dollars what another stupid laughing stock idiot president you know
[24:22.920 --> 24:28.440]  who was president in 1819 oh my gosh because that person was a really horrible
[24:28.440 --> 24:34.280]  person oh my gosh then there was the 1845 Texas annexation who do you don't
[24:34.280 --> 24:40.040]  want Texas and all that oil and all that land and all that power and I mean
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.800]  that that is just a horrible deal right there absolutely horrible deal and they
[24:46.800 --> 24:51.720]  got that for nothing another terrible horrible decision I mean Trump is a
[24:51.720 --> 24:56.600]  freaking kook man we're supposed to just roll over to globalism have
[24:56.600 --> 25:00.320]  multinational corporations buy up our countries and take control by fraud we're
[25:00.320 --> 25:04.440]  not supposed to take our money and make good purchases that will absolutely
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.840]  make us incredibly wealthy the average citizen gets a yearly paycheck from the
[25:09.840 --> 25:13.840]  government off the resources in Alaska and Trump's even proposing that for any
[25:13.840 --> 25:18.080]  US citizens that would move out of the inside baseball to Greenland we would
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.280]  then colonize it once it became a US territory and then later it would become
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.640]  a state oh but who wants to even offer those folks that because nobody else
[25:26.640 --> 25:31.160]  seems to be doing it then there's the Oregon Treaty the Oregon Treaty established
[25:31.160 --> 25:35.560]  the boundary between Canada the United States and the 49th parallel and again
[25:35.560 --> 25:41.520]  that was for nothing and then there's a Mexican cessation where we got massive
[25:41.520 --> 25:47.120]  amounts of stuff including California who wants that Utah Arizona all of that
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.920]  and that was taken again by force because Mexico couldn't even hold it from
[25:50.920 --> 25:55.000]  the Native Americans we can just continue here all these other horrible
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.760]  horrible purchases the 1853 Gadsden purchase from Mexico ten million dollars
[26:01.760 --> 26:07.520]  and again that gave us possession of the Valley South of the Gila River and the
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.680]  land in which the United States and Arizona and New Mexico now reside so
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.480]  again horrible getting large parts of Arizona and New Mexico what a horrible
[26:17.480 --> 26:22.600]  deal for ten million dollars what a terrible deal what stupid bad American
[26:22.600 --> 26:26.200]  presidents these American presidents absolutely just have to be stopped
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.320]  these are the worst people that actually bought all of this for almost
[26:30.320 --> 26:36.560]  nothing 15 million dollars for half the country from Napoleon Bonaparte wow I
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.360]  gotta say this Donald Trump is the scum of the earth he's an idiot he's a
[26:41.360 --> 26:46.640]  moron we should not try to buy the biggest island in the world worth over
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.960]  20 trillion dollars in current rates even though it's an indigenous population
[26:50.960 --> 26:55.720]  and they have autonomy and we could go in there and have a referendum and buy
[26:55.720 --> 26:58.880]  it from them for nothing and then they would get major investment and then
[26:58.880 --> 27:02.240]  major amounts of people moving there and then everybody will be trying to move
[27:02.240 --> 27:07.000]  to Greenland 50 years after we buy it guaranteed they'll be they'll be
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.200]  flotillas of people trying to break into the country they'll be huge migrant
[27:12.200 --> 27:17.200]  caravan ships they'll have to put fences up around Greenland once there's
[27:17.200 --> 27:22.360]  shopping malls and movie theaters and in all sorts of giant greenhouse
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.000]  facilities growing food and then once we develop it and there's all these you
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.680]  know incredible mountain ski resorts and hot springs I mean Greenland is
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.720]  incredible Greenland is magic maybe show that New York Times photo of Greenland
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.320]  it looks like where Santa Claus lives or something and part of the year warm
[27:41.320 --> 27:44.640]  air comes up for six months out of the year and the southern areas are very
[27:44.640 --> 27:51.040]  very nice oh but again it's autonomous we could buy it so everyone just laugh
[27:51.040 --> 27:59.080]  at Donald Trump you'll never be president you'll never get anything done
[27:59.080 --> 28:03.560]  you'll never win America's never been great it'll never be that great you know
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.800]  let's not forget the Alaska purchase from the Russians oh I forgot to get to

[33:56.040 --> 34:02.520]  much more but I saw this video last night and this morning and now I was
[34:02.520 --> 34:06.640]  talking to norm patis who is obviously one of the top constitutional criminal
[34:06.640 --> 34:09.640]  first-minute lawyers in the country you see him all over the news every day some
[34:09.640 --> 34:13.960]  of the biggest cases including some of mine and I was talking about another

[34:18.160 --> 34:22.320]  yet but I've talked to him I've watched the video and it just doesn't show what
[34:22.320 --> 34:26.640]  they're saying this ice captain pulls up to the facility where this antifa type
[34:26.640 --> 34:30.440]  crowd is there chanting and he does pull up quick at first as he's not

[34:33.680 --> 34:37.800]  it looks like about seven eight miles an hour and then they surround him and are
[34:37.800 --> 34:41.640]  beating on his window screaming things so it looks like he moves forward maybe a
[34:41.640 --> 34:45.560]  half a foot maybe putting it in gear you're not sure but barely bumps him and
[34:45.560 --> 34:52.440]  they go oh homicide you just murdered I mean almost murdered and then now they're
[34:52.440 --> 34:58.320]  talking about indicting him at the state level there in Rhode Island for
[34:58.320 --> 35:02.960]  attempted manslaughter murder or something Norm Patterson give you the
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.760]  inside scoop on this but the headlines aren't right from Fox News and even

[37:11.000 --> 37:15.360]  hoping and and and pleading that this can be as bad as possible there's a
[37:15.360 --> 37:18.720]  bunch of clips they're in the daily caller article linked up on info wars
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.840]  calm shot by the the demonstrators and on there they say never again with
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.320]  stars of David and they say we're fighting Nazis these people literally
[37:29.320 --> 37:32.960]  believe they're fighting Nazis when people are trying to pour into the
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.080]  country a lot of them have criminal records if they pour in they have
[37:37.080 --> 37:43.360]  criminal records they have children we deport them everybody does that norm
[37:43.360 --> 37:47.160]  paddice joins us to give us the inside baseball on this norm thanks for coming
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.920]  on yeah thanks Alex so yesterday Tom Woodward is the off officer he is a
[37:51.920 --> 37:56.680]  captain at the Wyatt federal detention facility it is the holding facility for
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.000]  pre-trial detainees at the federal level in Connecticut and Rhode Island and
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.280]  some of Massachusetts it also holds some from people who've been convicted of
[38:04.280 --> 38:08.960]  federal crimes and it also serves as a nice detention center for some months
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.040]  now protesters have been out trying to persuade the facility which is a private
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.960]  prison I'm not to honor its contract with the government to take ice detainees at
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.320]  one point the board concluded yeah okay we won't do it bondholders then sued
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.840]  saying a contract a contract honored a deal so they have detainees months that
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.000]  several months ago a 19 protesters were arrested for creating a public
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.800]  disturbance by depriving people of access to the facility and the case has
[38:34.800 --> 38:40.160]  become kind of a political hot potato as I see the videotape Woodward is
[38:40.160 --> 38:44.800]  reporting for duty and he sees people blocking the entrance to the facility
[38:44.800 --> 38:49.560]  and he approaches the card an alarming rate of speed and then breaks and these
[38:49.560 --> 38:52.800]  folks panic the acting as though they were sitting in the street and
[38:52.800 --> 38:57.680]  didn't expect to see a car coming they then jump up and his car is swarmed and
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.680]  he is berated and called an effing piece of feces but you know with the s word and
[39:02.680 --> 39:08.000]  and so forth I've watched the videotapes we didn't know whether we were going to
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.800]  be retained to represent it looks like we're not going to be but you know I
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.480]  watched the videotapes a number of times last night because I intended if I was
[39:15.480 --> 39:18.840]  going to represent them to come out swinging this morning and I'm still
[39:18.840 --> 39:22.040]  come out swinging anyhow without the client I just don't see the assault
[39:22.040 --> 39:26.400]  there now the press reports that five people went to the hospital a 64 year
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.120]  old man had a fractured leg and some internal injuries somebody else had
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.320]  minor injuries and three people were injured by the pepper spray that
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.080]  officers used thereafter candidly I don't see anybody getting hit by the car
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.120]  and I don't know how that individual was injured if he was injured when the
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.800]  crowd swarmed on him and their desire to climb over the car but what I do know
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.320]  is as a Connecticut resident I depend on that federal facility and the officers
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.360]  in it and for a number of ways I have clients who are in there I'm in the
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.280]  guards protect them and guards aren't permitted to say I couldn't get to work
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.200]  today because there were protesters outside now the protestors protestors
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.800]  stated objective is to shut the facility down should they just let
[40:07.800 --> 40:12.120]  everybody in it go some people are you know I get paid to keep people out of
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.560]  prison and generally view prison as a bad idea but there are some people who
[40:16.560 --> 40:21.200]  belong there because they're dangerous to society on that's what Thomas
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.720]  Woodworth was trying to do now these people are entitled the protesters to
[40:25.720 --> 40:30.840]  you know be as dramatic as they want to be and to liken our immigration policies
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.520]  to Nazi Germany but when they do so they trivialize the Holocaust and I say to
[40:35.520 --> 40:42.800]  them shame on you get real put both feet in the 21st century and take your
[40:42.800 --> 40:47.200]  heads out of your pity partying heinies because this was is a real crisis in
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.680]  this country that we need to face with mature public policy debates I will
[40:51.680 --> 40:56.960]  respect and defend their right to protest I will respect and defend their
[40:56.960 --> 41:01.120]  right to speak out about a matter of public concern I will defend and
[41:01.120 --> 41:04.520]  protect their right to pick it but when a guy's trying to go to work and his
[41:04.520 --> 41:09.880]  car gets swarmed he's not a Nazi this isn't Nazi Germany don't trivialize the
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.960]  Holocaust and stop making fools of yourself if you've got our political
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.880]  points to make make them but don't do so at the expense of public order and if
[41:17.880 --> 41:22.600]  you do at least have the courage that Henry David's throw or Martin Luther
[41:22.600 --> 41:26.680]  King had and understand what civil disobedience is when you break the law
[41:26.680 --> 41:31.560]  you pay a price that's what civil disobedience is you challenge a law and
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.800]  agree to be incarcerated the devil on top of it is every country on earth is
[41:35.800 --> 41:40.400]  being assaulted by collapsing third world populations and they've got the
[41:40.400 --> 41:45.680]  military on the border of Brazil and places like Venezuela because millions
[41:45.680 --> 41:49.840]  are trying to pour across its anarchy thousands are starving a day just in
[41:49.840 --> 41:56.080]  Venezuela alone and now the UN's forming Venezuelan caravans coming up
[41:56.080 --> 41:59.400]  here and we're supposed to just give everybody stuff free third of the time
[41:59.400 --> 42:02.760]  their adults with kids that aren't their kids of course we've got to ship them
[42:02.760 --> 42:07.240]  back I mean this is insane the Senate report norm as you know the Washington
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.200]  posting report on it said tens of thousands of children unaccompanied
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.040]  thousands in sex slavery hundreds dead but these people say never again these
[42:16.040 --> 42:20.880]  are death camps that's insane they are not death camps you talk about defamation
[42:20.880 --> 42:24.400]  that's dangerous you talk about inciting riots they know what they're doing oh
[42:24.400 --> 42:28.320]  absolutely they were chanting before no justice no peace well is it any wonder
[42:28.320 --> 42:31.600]  there wasn't peace on the streets you know in the whole world is watching yeah
[42:31.600 --> 42:34.400]  we're watching and we're wondering what the hell's the matter with you kids or
[42:34.400 --> 42:40.200]  you people I mean I you know I I wish Woodworth the best he yesterday his truck
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.480]  was impounded by a Rhode Island law enforcement authorities Governor
[42:44.480 --> 42:49.160]  Ramondo has already turned on him absent an investigation I suspect she's
[42:49.160 --> 42:52.720]  trying to become the bait-o-or-roar of New England and I wish you'd keep your
[42:52.720 --> 42:55.440]  bait-o to yourself down there that's right so the word is they're planning to
[42:55.440 --> 42:57.400]  crucify the sky thank you norm
[42:57.400 --> 43:01.680]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become
[43:01.680 --> 43:04.840]  big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of
[43:04.840 --> 43:08.240]  social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[43:08.240 --> 43:11.720]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the
[43:11.720 --> 43:14.600]  members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[43:14.600 --> 43:17.560]  members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real
[43:17.560 --> 43:21.240]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[43:21.240 --> 43:24.720]  will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.160]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and Iran American
[43:28.160 --> 43:31.480]  economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great
[43:31.480 --> 43:35.800]  Depression the inforores audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.720]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to
[43:39.720 --> 43:43.480]  make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is
[43:43.480 --> 43:46.880]  big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to
[43:46.880 --> 43:50.400]  meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of
[43:50.400 --> 43:53.360]  telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.160]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what we just saw

[44:58.120 --> 45:04.280]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in
[45:04.280 --> 45:07.160]  trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground
[45:07.160 --> 45:11.320]  close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.520]  nation and today the communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week
[45:15.520 --> 45:21.040]  ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what
[45:21.040 --> 45:25.480]  he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers that's
[45:25.480 --> 45:29.200]  beautiful Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down
[45:29.200 --> 45:33.520]  so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.560]  to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and
[45:37.560 --> 45:41.640]  all you've done is awaken the human spirit the human spirit lives at info
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.560]  wars.com and news wars.com and I'm asking listeners whatever you do spread
[45:46.560 --> 45:50.160]  those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[45:50.160 --> 45:53.160]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide.
[45:59.160 --> 46:03.840]  Without your support we won't be here and I couldn't thank you all enough for the
[46:03.840 --> 46:06.840]  fact that you've kept us in the game I mean I want to stay in this game I want
[46:06.840 --> 46:10.080]  to take the globalist on total transparencies our whole operation if I
[46:10.080 --> 46:14.080]  bring in $35 million half of that's the cost of the products we don't mark
[46:14.080 --> 46:17.520]  stuff up that much I don't care if I'm not making money but you need to buy the
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.280]  products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got great toothpaste
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.040]  we've got great things like DNA Force Plus but ultimate krill oil has been
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.200]  sold out for four months for whatever reason this became the most popular
[46:28.200 --> 46:32.600]  fish oil it's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest purest krill
[46:32.600 --> 46:36.480]  oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the
[46:36.480 --> 46:40.920]  expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any type of krill oil you get
[46:40.920 --> 46:44.360]  that doesn't give you fish burps which I don't like but gives you all the great
[46:44.360 --> 46:47.840]  benefits isn't real it's been boiled it's been real and it's been a montage this
[46:47.840 --> 46:52.240]  is not good this ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality krill oil you're
[46:52.240 --> 46:56.240]  gonna find anywhere real krill oil folks is red it's not yellow it's not milky
[46:56.240 --> 46:59.840]  this is nothing but krill oil
[46:59.840 --> 47:17.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:17.400 --> 47:26.000]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.920]  well I think one of the things Frank Fungalusi is that this president has
[47:30.920 --> 47:35.240]  always from anyone who is around him Anthony Scaramucci knows this as well
[47:35.240 --> 47:41.240]  as anybody else demanded this blind loyalty right I say it it must be so or
[47:41.240 --> 47:47.720]  even if you don't think it's so you don't criticize me for it well this is
[47:47.720 --> 47:52.160]  why it's so important to look through the the lens of radicalization when you
[47:52.160 --> 47:56.400]  look at this president and then apply counter radicalization techniques
[47:56.400 --> 48:02.560]  because you're right attacking his followers is is going to be counter
[48:02.560 --> 48:07.040]  productive he demands that loyalty and they are loyal so if you call Trump
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.440]  followers racist and mass they simply coalesce around each other and become
[48:11.440 --> 48:15.920]  even more defensive and protective of the leader just as they would in say a
[48:15.920 --> 48:22.400]  terrorist organization to compare to the radicalization but that's Frank
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.720]  Fungalusi former deputy director of the FBI under Obama if you believe in
[48:28.720 --> 48:31.720]  America if you believe in freedom if you believe in the family believe the
[48:31.720 --> 48:34.960]  Second Amendment if you believe in defending our borders if you want to
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.800]  purchase land that you can buy to make your country wealthier and larger and
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.480]  stronger well you're a bad person that's why I love them making fun of Trump
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.120]  trying to buy Greenland the largest island in the world over 20 trillion
[48:50.120 --> 48:55.960]  dollars of discovered oil and gas and we could go in there and buy it from the
[48:55.960 --> 49:04.080]  indigenous population that's autonomous from Denmark even under a bidding war 200
[49:04.080 --> 49:09.880]  billion dollars would be chicken feed all that's on it now is a bunch of
[49:09.880 --> 49:17.800]  shacks couple hundred thousand people and that's seasonal the annuets didn't
[49:17.800 --> 49:25.720]  even start living there until the Vikings built settlements 700 years ago not
[49:25.720 --> 49:32.200]  even the Eskimos can settle it until leaf Erickson and the rest of the crew
[49:32.200 --> 49:43.000]  showed up and trailblazed it and now it just sits there waiting for multinational
[49:43.000 --> 49:51.600]  corporations to come in and get it for nothing and Trump's an idiot Trump's a
[49:51.600 --> 49:58.880]  terrorist kind of like that purchase of Alaska for 7.2 million in 1867 terrible
[49:58.880 --> 50:03.040]  idea it's worth tens of trillions now
[50:03.160 --> 50:08.840]  Midway Islands got that for free terrible idea Hawaiian Islands that was
[50:08.840 --> 50:13.040]  the worst it's terrible we don't want to us some American Philippine Islands
[50:13.040 --> 50:17.120]  terrible idea purchase a bunch of that from Spain Puerto Rico terrible idea
[50:17.120 --> 50:21.480]  Glam terrible idea American Simone terrible idea Wake Island terrible idea
[50:21.480 --> 50:25.880]  Panama Canal zone that we then built the Panama Canal terrible idea just
[50:25.880 --> 50:31.480]  terrible Virgin Islands Kingsman Raymond this is just the modern stuff the
[50:31.480 --> 50:39.200]  worst one is 15 million for the entire midwest down to Louisiana Mississippi how
[50:39.200 --> 50:45.080]  many states is that now today but by 12 states I mean 12 states I mean that is
[50:45.080 --> 50:56.200]  the worst idea I ever heard of Louisiana purchase yep Trump's an idiot he's a bad guy well you
[50:56.200 --> 51:02.520]  just heard the former deputy director of the FBI he said the Trump supporters are
[51:02.520 --> 51:08.140]  like a terrorist last week he said Trump lowered the flags to have staff to
[51:08.140 --> 51:15.800]  Hile Hitler because he knows leftist life she believed that yes he ordered him
[51:15.800 --> 51:20.800]  lowered him a certain date and brought back up another to salute Hitler because
[51:20.800 --> 51:25.400]  it was 88 you know not many people know that a very small group of prisoners
[51:25.400 --> 51:29.080]  like the number 88 because it's the number of the alphabet it kind of
[51:29.080 --> 51:37.760]  becomes a schizophrenic thing that H is 8 and so H H 8 8 don't tell Drew Pearson
[51:37.760 --> 51:47.160]  that or anybody else that's got the Jersey 88 unbelievable you know the
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.680]  only football jersey I ever think I wore as an adult is I like Drew Pearson
[51:51.680 --> 51:54.320]  because he had a good attitude what it was a Christian it wasn't a corrupt guy
[51:54.320 --> 51:59.760]  and actually had a Drew Pearson 88 Jersey I didn't know it was for Hitler did
[51:59.760 --> 52:03.960]  you know it was for Hitler I didn't know the Dallas Cowboys were so avowed
[52:03.960 --> 52:11.520]  Hitlerian you know Jay Z the admitted former crack dealer now met with the
[52:11.520 --> 52:17.480]  head of the NFL this week and he's gonna head up the Justice Warriors section of
[52:17.480 --> 52:27.320]  the FBI yeah you have 44% of the NFL's profits are down 40% of their viewers if
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.880]  that doesn't make you want to get into SJW more social justice warrior well then
[52:32.880 --> 52:37.160]  nothing will I mean I would not be involved with the NFL in any way I
[52:37.160 --> 52:42.680]  refuse to watch any games I refuse to wear any of the apparel I found an old
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.120]  pair of Nike tennis shoes man I've had for like 10 years in storage and they're
[52:48.120 --> 52:54.400]  comfortable as hell but I threw them away threw them in the trash because I am
[52:54.400 --> 53:00.320]  not gonna be associated with anything to do with SJWs or globalism or any of it
[53:00.320 --> 53:08.120]  it's truly disgusting I'm gonna stop right there I wanted to get into Ms.
[53:08.120 --> 53:14.000]  Maxwell the reported procure of young girls you know the female handler for
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.800]  the sex operatives her data famous MI6 spy she did a stage photo op with a
[53:19.800 --> 53:25.480]  book about the life and death of CIA operatives she's telling the world what
[53:25.480 --> 53:32.040]  she's doing she's just a regular person that served her country it's all a big
[53:32.040 --> 53:36.160]  message that if you mess with me I'll release info we'll see how good that
[53:36.160 --> 53:43.360]  worked out for Jeffrey sweetheart you know he had dead man switches let's see
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.080]  the establishment thinks Google can hide all that if it comes out because you
[53:48.080 --> 53:51.320]  know Google's actively suppressing anything about Jeffrey Epstein or the
[53:51.320 --> 53:56.640]  Clintons imagine all those Google employees signed on unless they speak
[53:56.640 --> 54:03.440]  out to supporting pedophiles but not the folks we have coming on today now we've
[54:03.440 --> 54:08.960]  got a big Google whistleblower who's so far only done a taped interview with
[54:08.960 --> 54:13.000]  project Veritas Greg Coppola is a senior engineer put on a misread of
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.760]  leaf he's gonna be joining us and then Zach Voorhees is scheduled to be trying
[54:18.760 --> 54:22.720]  to get in on the line as well he's in a very important meeting in New York City
[54:22.720 --> 54:26.960]  with some professors and scientists some of the folks you've been seeing
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.200]  testified to Congress I'm not limited to talk about it yet but this is a big big
[54:31.200 --> 54:39.680]  deal and the levy has broken in fact we should probably come in with the levy
[54:39.680 --> 54:44.120]  breaks from Led Zeppelin when he joined us at six after but first let me just
[54:44.120 --> 54:56.040]  remind folks of this we're only here because of you and the last two weeks
[54:56.040 --> 55:01.360]  the Democratic Party has filed two more lawsuits on me for Sandy Hook because
[55:01.360 --> 55:04.240]  they believe that the Court of Appeals is going to throw their lawsuits out
[55:04.240 --> 55:09.160]  coming up in September just like the Supreme Court is looking over the
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.760]  shoulder of the kangaroo operations in Connecticut against me unheard of during
[55:13.760 --> 55:16.840]  the suit the Supreme Court came in and took the case as a public interest and
[55:16.840 --> 55:22.320]  is looking at it saying that my rights are being violated your rights are being
[55:22.320 --> 55:25.160]  violated they're trying to end the First Amendment by misrepresenting things
[55:25.160 --> 55:31.160]  here's KXCN right here additional lawsuit filed against Alex Jones by
[55:31.160 --> 55:36.360]  Sandy Hook parents last week another one this week and they've amended and
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.240]  pulled most of the stuff out of their suit that I never said or didn't do I'm
[55:40.240 --> 55:43.840]  talking to fly very well with the appeals court or the Supreme Court of
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.280]  Texas or the Supreme Court so they know those suits are indeed trouble if it
[55:48.280 --> 55:50.280]  doesn't get thrown up by the appeals court you know the First Amendment's
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.880]  basically dead at least at that level but they've gotten the winds that it's
[55:54.880 --> 55:58.320]  going to be thrown out and so oh don't worry here's more suits well it doesn't
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.360]  work that way you don't file when one suit fails another one in the same cause
[56:02.360 --> 56:06.040]  so it's all about face-saving it's all about desperation it'll be all over the
[56:06.040 --> 56:11.560]  news again oh he's soon he's going down well we're not going down unless you let
[56:11.560 --> 56:15.760]  us go down and so you've been really coming through we're trying to expand

[58:50.040 --> 58:54.200]  that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[58:54.200 --> 58:58.360]  and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we've
[58:58.360 --> 59:01.280]  still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually
[59:01.280 --> 59:05.720]  hated it but now they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down
[59:05.720 --> 59:09.320]  off of government buildings weird white leftist that one of virtue's signal or
[59:09.320 --> 59:13.880]  pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags this is the bizarreness
[59:13.880 --> 59:17.800]  of the America hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act at a time
[59:17.800 --> 59:21.800]  of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag
[59:21.800 --> 59:26.640]  particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on
[59:26.640 --> 59:31.880]  the back right there ladies and gentlemen America's back in full wars.com so
[59:31.880 --> 59:36.000]  whatever you do take action today and exercise your free speech in these
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.040]  bullies face all over not just the US but worldwide because more than ever the
[59:40.040 --> 59:53.040]  American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism you're listening to
[59:53.040 --> 01:00:21.600]  the Alex Jones show
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.000]  the rats are leaving the sinking ship as it comes out the Democratic Party
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.760]  particularly has been running giant blackmail rings using underage women and
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:39.160]  children and at the deeper levels of the rat hole human sacrifice it's all
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.640]  coming out how Jeffrey Epstein thought he was building a super race of humans
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.160]  now they're gonna merge with machines and be gods that's the delusional cult of
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.000]  these devil worshipers believing that they're gonna cheat God's judgment day
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.760]  they're gonna cheat justice by immortality and we all need to be fed
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.960]  into the mouth of the New World Order though before their God gives them
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.040]  redemption Stephen Colbert won't get redemption none of them will and I love
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.920]  that Stephen Colbert who's been one of the most vicious hacks reading off
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:16.920]  teleprompters scripted garbage posing as a newsman posing as a comedian when
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.720]  really he's a disinformation officer so here he is now saying he's not part of
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:29.240]  the resistance just an attempt to tap the brakes here it is there are many
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.680]  people who have already destroyed themselves but because they've so gone
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.720]  after Trump that they themselves it blows back up they've gone down to his
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.200]  level I'm not going against him I'm this I am not the resistance I said this I
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.520]  think the first night after he was elected I think it was the next day
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.280]  because they were like remember there were like the next day a little too late
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.280]  they were marches and all the streets people are like wait no we care like a
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.360]  day after it mattered and I think what I said at the top of the mom was like I
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.200]  just want to like we're not there was this is not the resistance a day after
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:10.920]  it mattered because because we didn't get Hillary Clinton this monster war
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.080]  criminal with all of her horrible past and all the terrible things she's done
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:21.200]  this was supposed to be your goddess and then now there's the little CIA lackey
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.360]  the heir to one of the biggest fortunes in the world Anderson Cooper who puts
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.920]  up the most vicious lies 24-7 and they're now pretending like oh we were
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.560]  never the resistance because they're failing so now they're telling you we're
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.960]  not part of the army that failed by the way the American people taking back
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.700]  control of our country the American people try to take back control of big
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.680]  tech that's openly trying to manipulate the elections and bragging that they
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.440]  can throw it to whoever they want that's the real resistance globalism's the
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.520]  trillion-pound gorilla it's the big elephant in the room it's what's taken
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.360]  over the planet it's what's authoritarian China has killed over a hundred
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.440]  million other people China has two million woogers in Mongolia who are
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.160]  Muslims in forced labor camps that's all real a Trump's not doing that I'm not
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.520]  doing that America's not doing that but we're taught to hate ourselves we're

[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.480]  Alex yes I got a plug for the Patriot points I get oh thanks $180 so far this
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.520]  year and I feel like I'm stealing from you I buy so much in the store because I
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.600]  mean I don't want to get that money to Walmart I don't want to give that money
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.000]  to people gonna donate it to causes I don't believe in so I'd rather give that
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.200]  money to you and I'm getting quality products the products I do receive have
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.440]  changed my life I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me I've lost weight my
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.240]  brain works a whole lot better I think my kids they use the toothpaste my son
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.160]  used to get these little sore throat and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.640]  gets rid of his sore throat so let me break this down for you I want high
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.880]  quality stuff in there I want a good price but I've kind of habituated
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.880]  everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off I'm making $2 on the
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.600]  toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.280]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.760]  Patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.200]  already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship and then we're doing 50% off
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.680]  and then you do something like that we have Patriot points we lose money but
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.760]  that's okay thanks for the support
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:11.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:19.480]  tyranny well so does he lie from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:29.080]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide thank
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:35.640]  you so much for joining us Greg Coppola is a senior software engineer at Google
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.840]  currently who has been placed on administrative leave of the 24 hours
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.280]  after publicly suggested the company is politically biased the man said the
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:47.040]  sky is blue grass is green project Veritas released an interview with him
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.520]  we're gonna play about two minutes over in a moment where he exposed Google's
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.480]  dishonest methods and practices among which are political bias boosting and
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.360]  deboosting of search results for specific websites perjury of Google CEO
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.440]  Sundar Pachaita Congress and other questionable practices so I want to
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.680]  play a short two-minute clip of what he said a few weeks ago on project Veritas
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.640]  seems like a lifetime has passed since then we'll get updates what he thinks of
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.440]  Zach Voorhees and all these huge incredible developments that are
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:23.760]  unfolding there's a few minutes from that first big step he took that's now
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:29.520]  had so many other engineers go public or leak information here it is my name is
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.800]  Greg Coppola I'm a senior software engineer I work on artificial
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.560]  intelligence and the Google assistant yeah I mean overall I'm very concerned to
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:45.840]  see big tech and the big media merge basically with the political party with
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.280]  the Democrat Party I have a PhD I have five years of experience at Google and I
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.480]  just know how algorithms are they don't write themselves we write them to do we
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.320]  want them to do I look at search and I look at Google news and I see what it's
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.840]  doing and I see Google executives go to Congress and say that it's not
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:09.720]  manipulated it's not political and I'm just so sure that's not true I think as
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.360]  the election started to ramp up the angle that the Democrats and the media took
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.160]  was that anyone who liked Donald Trump was a racist even a Nazi and that got
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.280]  picked up everywhere well I think we're just at a really you know important
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:30.760]  point in human history I think for a while we had tech that was politically
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:39.040]  neutral now we have tech that really first of all is taking sides in a
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.680]  political contest which I think you know anytime you have big corporate power
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.800]  emerging with political parties can be dangerous and I think more generally we
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:58.520]  have to just decide now that we kind of are seeing tech use its power to
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.960]  manipulate people it's a time to decide you know do we run the technology does
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.320]  the technology run us I really don't buy the idea that big tech is politically
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.720]  neutral and I think we need to start incorporating that into whatever strategy
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.320]  we use to have a democracy going forward are we going to continue to have
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:22.480]  elections that mean anything are we going to continue to think for ourselves or
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.840]  are we going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:31.800]  election from now on so why did you decide to come to Project Veritas you
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.480]  guys have done a lot of good reporting on a variety of topics I do think it's
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.320]  a credible news organization they may be able to stop one man but they can't
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:49.560]  stop all of us be brave do something absolutely what a hero Greg Coppola a
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.000]  senior engineer making a lot of money but seeing them put their finger on the
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.360]  scale of this country's electoral process and so much more and going public
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.920]  so Greg you're really the expert I've got a lot of questions here but I'd like
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.680]  to give you the floor for the rest of the hour to really you're a very well
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.520]  spoken person so is a Zach Voorhees I'm really just impressed by the caliber of
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.840]  people that Google had working for him and and the fact that you've also been
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:20.960]  standing up so thanks for joining us thanks nice to be here I just want to
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.280]  clarify one thing obviously I don't speak I'm not here speaking for Google I'm
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.240]  just speaking myself absolutely you've been you've been suspended since you
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.480]  went public and you're speaking as a private citizen right that's right all
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.480]  right well thanks for coming on with us Greg you're at the Coppola underscore
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.200]  Gregory on Twitter for now like all of us or some of us that have already been
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.280]  taken off but everybody hanging on to this whole gulag by their by their
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.680]  fingertips I mean it's interesting on the Twitter thing I mean I got 9,000
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.360]  followers in the first two hours and I haven't had any more followers even
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.000]  after I went on Tucker Carlson even after the President Trump retweeted me so I
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.520]  think they're getting maybe cute I don't know but I think that's one of the
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.280]  problems is we don't have transparency so it's kind of just like he said oh my
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.320]  son went on Twitter a month ago he got 10,000 in like you said two hours and
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:16.360]  then it stopped there even though he said videos with a half million views and
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:21.840]  everybody's saying they're trying to follow him they're just not able to yeah
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.720]  right I mean I mean I honestly like being able to go viral is almost like a
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.240]  human right in the 21st century so I think we really need transparency around
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.600]  why certain things can trend and why certain things can't well well I want
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.520]  to give you the floor because you're saying some powerful stuff but that's
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.240]  true it's so human to be able to vote like a restaurant that's good we all go
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.760]  to it music that's great we all hear it it becomes popular so they're saying no
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.880]  if what you're saying is popular but we don't agree with it we're not gonna let
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.120]  you be in the marketplace of ideas take Joe Rogan's podcast he admits that they
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.960]  even shadow banned it but it's had something like 50 million views on all
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.200]  the platforms it's bigger than a Zealon Musk over 10 million it's the biggest
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.880]  podcast he's ever done but because it's the biggest thing he ever did it's too
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.480]  dangerous to ever basically probably have me on again so again being most
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:17.640]  popular now and being what humans agree with that's now verboten yeah I mean I
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.880]  don't know I guess so I mean the thing I would really stress is like Twitter is
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.360]  not a very complicated piece of software anyone could start a Twitter at least a
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.400]  small-scale one so you know I don't understand how we've gone into a
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.080]  situation where it's like we act like Twitter is the only way to make a
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.400]  microblogging service I mean like if you just do I was doing introduction to
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.120]  Ruby on Rails the other day and like lesson 3 is creating a microblogging
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.840]  service so anyone can really start one and I don't understand why we're in the
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.160]  situation where it seems like Twitter can decide what trends well you know the
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:56.200]  problem Twitter Facebook and Google buy an Apple buy everything up yeah I mean
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.520]  I think another one of the problems they have is like if there is a competitor
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:05.440]  that wants to be independent then various media you know outfits are gonna
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.960]  say they're Nazis they're white supremacists they're involved in
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.680]  shootings and stuff like that sure if gabbs got 15 million people on it and
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.000]  they've got 50 Nazis on there most of the Southern Prairie Law Center posing as
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.760]  Nazis oh well you can't have gabb now it can't have servers because they're all
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.400]  Nazis but meanwhile somebody can do the Christchurch shooting on Facebook that's
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.520]  okay yeah Facebook I mean they could use anything they could use Coca-Cola it
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.400]  doesn't matter nobody talks about those companies in the same way but somehow
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.880]  when it's alternative media companies it's like yeah it's gotta be shut down
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.960]  everyone's gotta be shut down now now listen I want to talk about you because
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.320]  you're a senior engineer you're still at Google but you've been you've been put
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.400]  on administrative leave so we're gonna break it a few minutes but tell us what
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.000]  you want to cover today because you're the expert you're the insider well the
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.880]  big thing to me is that they haven't covered Zach's leaks yesterday I mean
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.240]  they didn't cover me you know you can sort of look but then some analyses where
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.720]  you just sort of look at what are the the sites that Google thinks is credible
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.000]  we've learned it's all about hand-picking who's credible from Zach's
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.680]  leaks and all these people that are credible have not discussed my interview
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.240]  which was turning on a lot of different publications but even worse is Zach
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.960]  because you know you could argue with me well just his opinion was he know I
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.600]  mean I predicted exactly like Zach's leaks where I guess I could have found
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.120]  them myself Zach and I have different temperaments I didn't find them but what
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.240]  I predicted was more or less exactly what he released sure what you were seeing
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:41.200]  organically from the inside but not digging I mean you could see the results
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.520]  and you could guess how they were doing it but he was there chronicling it as he
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.240]  saw it unfold I mean the thing about me is I just implemented so many algorithms
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.920]  I've been coding for so long and I've been doing ranking at PhD or industrial
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.080]  level for 10 years so I just know what all that I just know what the toolbox is
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.840]  so I just know how things are done but you know someone else who doesn't it was
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.800]  an inexpert could say well it's just some guy you know but then Zach he's
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.760]  basically like the Ed Snowden almost of the Google thing he's almost a Ed
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:13.320]  Snowden of industry rather than government and you know he leaked
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.280]  everything and the New York Times hasn't even told their readers it CNN hasn't
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.280]  told their readers so I just I'm a little spooked by the whole thing it's
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.440]  almost like what are they trying to do are they gonna try to make sure no one
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.520]  knows until 2020 how's that gonna work I mean I don't know like they're
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.400]  basically proving the point that we're kind of saying there's this system of
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.880]  censorship and then it's like people are trying to leave Google or at least not
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:37.440]  leave but stay there because stay there Greg as we're gonna come back I mean
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.720]  this is incredible you know who is watching is the White House and the
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.120]  Pentagon so don't worry Google can think they're gonna block everybody else from
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.280]  seeing this or hearing it haha the White House is watching live right now sir and
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.440]  so's Matt Grudge and many others so Stucker Carlson will be right back they're
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:59.360]  watching right now maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon you'll need a

[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.480]  I bring in 35 million dollars half of that's the cost of the products we don't
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.000]  mark stuff up that much I don't care if I'm not making money but you need to buy
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.480]  the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got great
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.520]  toothpaste we've got great things like DNA Force Plus but ultimate krill oil has
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.560]  been sold out for four months for whatever reason this became the most
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.760]  popular fish oil it's totally full the bottle and it is the strongest purest
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:34.080]  krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.480]  expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any type of krill oil you get

[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.920]  is nothing but krill oil the globalists are hyper competitive scientific
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.040]  dictators they are technocrats they are control freaks in their own words and
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.400]  they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions it's

[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.920]  dimension but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.160]  really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if I wasn't taking the
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.440]  highest quality supplements for the forest life calm I couldn't do it that's
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.440]  why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.320]  quality medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.640]  12 ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality B12 over the

[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.080]  show.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:23.840]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live in defiance of Google
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:30.080]  Apple the chai comms and the globalists on hundreds of radio stations hundreds of
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.520]  TV stations but the only way we get out in cyberspace is your word of mouth it's
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:41.720]  not key it's beyond paramount it's essential. Insider raises alarm on Google
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:46.280]  AI project in China that's off the Zat 4 he's interview yesterday whistleblower
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.200]  Google already stealing 2020 election Insider reveals how Google took down
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.720]  Jordan Peterson mother of all Google whistleblower exposes Google criminal
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.240]  plan to control all information whistleblower explains how Google purposely
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.720]  broke its search engine and then let third-party actors in I already saw the
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:11.280]  Southern Primary Law Center and all these other outfits a media matters CNN
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.080]  already knew all my internal stuff they knew how much money I was making they
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:19.160]  knew who local geoengineered sponsors were that I'd sold that weren't
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.160]  available nationwide they later admitted no they were given access to my
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:29.360]  account talk about raping so that's all coming up and and Jack Voorhees is
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.640]  coming on as well great couple is very excited about that great I'm gonna shut
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.840]  up right now because I've got all these points and all these things I want to
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:38.240]  ask but I want to just give you the floor to talk about why you went public
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.920]  what's happened since why what just you've got the floor right now tell us
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.360]  what you want to impart to folks you're a major whistleblower the most senior
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:56.600]  the person to go public so to break it down okay well I would say in terms of
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:03.240]  why I went public I just I think that there is a bias in a lot of these
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.600]  products including Google and so I think that it should be transparent I
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:14.280]  actually not that big into a regulation so much but I think if Google's angle
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:18.600]  wants to be like sort of like have an angle the way that the New York Times
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.440]  has an angle like that's fine I just think everyone should be transparent
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:27.520]  about it and I'm I definitely I think that people believe that when they're
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:31.600]  getting when they're say they're on Google Google news they think that
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.360]  somehow an algorithm has determined that that that this is like true
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.640]  information so for example like if you log on there and you search for Donald
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.780]  Trump and it's Trump's erases Trump's erases Trump's erases Trump's a
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.040]  homophobe something like that they think a lot of people seem to have the
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.400]  impression that somehow some kind of advanced algorithm finds this out and
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:59.480]  it just you know my suspicion was that it was really being set by hand and and I
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:04.120]  think to some extent that was known I mean it was probably already known by a
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.040]  lot of people but if there was any ambiguity
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:14.120]  Zach's dump yesterday which you know I'm not endorsing every single thing that
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.600]  was released but I would definitely say there was a lot of important stuff
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:22.040]  whereas very clear that the notion of trusted sources is completely set by
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:27.800]  people and I also I I've done some analyses of like what the I mean from
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.920]  like a user's perspective what the sources are I mean everyone kind of
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:35.120]  knows but I I sent your producers a link to techwatch.live but you can
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.440]  basically see on what they are and you know the top ones let's say are CNN USA
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.040]  Today, Politico, HuffPost, New York Times so to say that those are the most
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.800]  trusted sources and that it's politically neutral I mean I don't
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.280]  understand what notion of the word politically yeah so there you go so this
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:57.640]  is if you search for Donald Trump on in Google News you'll see that this is the
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.960]  percentage of time each website is used so this is the top 15 websites and
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.080]  obviously whatever algorithm Google has run they think that CNN is that
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:10.720]  the most credible which I mean for half the country that's like a that's
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:15.320]  basically just all you need to know right there but yeah I mean CNN fix the
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:20.160]  debates for Hillary that's admitted yeah it's hard to really find a hoax that
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.080]  they aren't involved in and also even if you just look at the nature of that
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.520]  distribution aside from just who the top sources are it's called a power lot
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.960]  distribution or 80-20 or which get richer distribution and basically just
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.840]  means that you know 80% of the results that are being shown at all you can
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.720]  even scroll down to graphs here you'll see that the 20 top sites make up the
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:51.040]  80% of the top yeah so this next one shows just like over time which sources
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.400]  are being used and if you go to the third one you can see the what the what
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.200]  the meaning of this distribution is which is that these top 20 sites if you
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.840]  search for Donald Trump 80% of all results come from these so from a
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.640]  probabilistic perspective I mean they're more or less at this point this is
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.360]  from a server that doesn't have cookies and doesn't have an account so this is
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.880]  to be like if you just if they don't know anything about you I mean I think
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.480]  this I think but this experiment is saying sure if I want to look up a
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.920]  restaurant and they didn't like me they could put cockroaches in as the top
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.880]  search it's very simple and I have to go to Bing now or other search engines
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.600]  even find out new news about myself because they just handpicked the worst
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.280]  news and stuff from six months ago is just stuck at the top of Google it's
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:37.160]  done very ham fistedly yeah I think searching for like say you in particular
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:45.480]  really shows how manual the process must be like on being you type in Alex Jones
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.000]  or info wars is the top thing you do it on Google I'm like the third or fourth
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:59.400]  page yeah my sights are my sights are so info wars or news wars is like page
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.680]  three or four but there's three or four pages just negative lies but used to
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.720]  hours at the top because that's me people are searching for me they can at
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:11.640]  least hear what I'm really saying I mean to some extent I think that the
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.480]  pressure to do things like this has even been in public right people say you
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.040]  have to demote Alex Jones or you have to demote the Russian box and so I mean I
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.560]  think actually you know all these tech companies because of their power are
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.520]  probably just in a tough spot where you know everyone's kind of everyone wants
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.080]  to have more influence over tech companies I mean it you know every
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.120]  business every political party every candidate or everyone's trying to get
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.880]  more influence over tech company so I think it is a hard problem I mean they
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.360]  probably maybe they responded to one interest group and now other interest
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.600]  groups are really upset so you know I don't really know but I mean ideally
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.080]  there if there was like a lot of competition you know maybe wouldn't even
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:55.400]  be an issue all I know is this you know the top story for like a month was that
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.560]  I lost a lawsuit for writing a book about Sandy Hook I never wrote the book I'm
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.400]  not in the book and I called AP had lawyers and letters they go we don't
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.960]  care if you didn't write the book it stays up and Google and Twitter and
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.800]  Facebook all made it the top story Yahoo did for a whole day and so this is
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.320]  completely weaponized I mean I've experienced the fact that they have
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:20.960]  hired all these Democratic Party people to actually work at Google and actually
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.360]  run this yeah that's interesting I mean for the most part I was just engaged in
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.480]  you know building natural language understanding and there was really no
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:37.360]  political angle one way or the other and so I'm only kind of you know learning
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.480]  about this indirectly no no I understand so but but according to Zach and others
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.440]  and I saw this happen in real time as soon as Hillary lost that's when all
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:52.960]  this ramped up something like that yeah maybe even a little before but yeah I
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.320]  kind of feel I you know I kind of just intuitively felt it was around yeah 2016
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.520]  type of time that that the things changed and they became there was a lot
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.920]  more talk about a lot of political issues and including the identity politics
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:10.800]  we're gonna go to break but I'm sure you saw the video with the Google execs the
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.080]  day after Hillary lost they're like we're not gonna let this happen again and
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.760]  then other Google execs Project Veritas got video they said well we're not gonna
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.720]  let the Trump thing happen again I mean that's pretty smoking gun yeah I mean
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:25.840]  it was interesting it's like you know we're sad that Hillary lost I mean you
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.960]  know there's no one on stage that's happy that Hillary lost you know how is
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:34.600]  that neutral well you got a lot of courage Greg Coppola suspended at

[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.960]  have integrity in elections I want to be transparent that they're biased against

[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.680]  the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:26.080]  our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:30.520]  gonna back down so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.240]  world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never gonna
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.280]  give up and all you've done is a wake of the human spirit the human spirit lives
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:43.720]  at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com and I'm asking listeners whatever you do
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.640]  spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:52.480]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:33:04.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:24.400]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:37.200]  of the info war ladies and gentlemen we've got incredible breaking news there
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:43.560]  was a car fire down on I-35 today let's go to that dramatic footage all of that
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.320]  stuff is just part of life it's sad people die in car wrecks people get
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:52.720]  cancer airplanes crash but when you've got organized information technology
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:56.400]  systems that are the total revolution of the human future and we're already
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.720]  interfacing with it it's taking us over and then you've got a political class
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:07.120]  that is in control of that ally with communist China and it's openly trying
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:12.160]  to use that technology to control what people think and do and then walling
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.880]  off whole masses of people and dehumanizing them and not letting them
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:24.200]  communicate and giving them communist Chinese social scores well ladies and
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:31.000]  gentlemen that is authoritarianism that's what that is and that is extremely
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.840]  dangerous and it's not just the authoritarianism of the deadly poisonous
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:41.040]  hitlerian type or the North Korean nightmare type or the venezuelan
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:49.280]  mismanage you to death type it's the organized AI type authoritarian mega
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.920]  corporation meets AI sounds like into the world end of humanity oh but the
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.400]  transhumanists say it's the post human revolution because humans are parasites
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.920]  on the earth and then you get why Jeffrey Epstein was into eugenics and the
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.520]  uber mention in all the same crap which allows these people to believe they're
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.440]  building a better world a better future a better club as George Carlin said
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.240]  we're not in it so Zach Voorhees I thought made history yesterday it was
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.520]  totally blacked out except for dredgerport.com and viewers and listeners of
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.160]  the show which is millions of people but we're talking to Greg Coppola who is a
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.920]  senior engineer highly respected put on leave when he went public a month ago
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:34.520]  project very tops and he's saying he thinks that Zach Voorhees is the Ed
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.160]  Snowden of whistleblower so far I certainly thought it with the
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.560]  documents he put out that are incredibly damning that will put on screen for TV
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.960]  viewers that project very toss has that we've linked to so we're gonna ride
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:53.360]  shotgun here together but before we go to Zach you were describing him Greg
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.640]  Coppola on Twitter at Coppola underscore Gregory as the Ed Snowden I would agree
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.760]  but you're the guy the engineer the senior guy you know that's got the 35
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.240]  thousand foot view I saw what you guys to kind of have a discussion here maybe
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:08.720]  for the first time I don't know the next two segments please don't don't talk to
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.640]  me or I'll interrupt but but elaborate on why you would talk about what this is
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:18.600]  so important. Well I mean the big takeaway for me was that everything is
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.920]  really it's all about like sources that are picked by hand and based on
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.800]  relationships that was my big takeaway from Zach's dump and also certain
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.520]  topics that were considered fringe you know like climate change is a hoax that's
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.400]  a fringe idea which is very interesting because like climate change is
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.640]  actually a collection of questions so I don't understand how you know doubting
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:43.640]  any one of them as a hoax there's also you know issues like Pizzagate I mean the
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.480]  you know they sort of said that the Epstein you know the talk about Epstein
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.840]  in 2016 like that was considered you know a fringe topic and now it's like
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.920]  he's been you know arrested and now he's dead so I mean is that still a fringe
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.840]  topic and who's deciding these fringe topics but my main takeaway is like it's
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.120]  all it's all set by hand I mean they have people decide who's credible and
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.920]  that's a radical break from what it used to be which was that the algorithm could
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:14.280]  find a needle in a haystack and basically without really anyone's bias
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:19.320]  getting involved. So you guys right now and that's why I had I wouldn't do the
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.480]  interview if Dave saw I would interrupt because just your climate change point I
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.720]  could talk for an hour I mean I love talking to scientists you get it
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.880]  everyone knows climate change is real it's constantly happening that's the
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:31.360]  only constant is change but they're saying oh you question what we're saying
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.760]  about the change you're not allowed to have input you're supposed to just go
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:40.120]  what we say 100% agreement there's no 100% agreement in any science but I'm
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.400]  gonna stop there for the hour. I think we should have Greg Coppola here with our
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:52.880]  next guest who's joining us Zach Voorhees at perpetual maniac on Twitter you
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.160]  guys have a discussion here meeting each other talking to each other go
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:07.560]  ahead. Hey Greg how you doing? I'm happy to join you guys for the
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.880]  show today sorry I think it was a delay I want to say that it's a pleasure to
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:19.400]  come back on the show with you Alex you you were the first one outside of my
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:25.120]  environmental high school class in high school to point out that the frogs were
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:29.520]  turning gay and it was really funny that everyone attacks you for that when you
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.240]  know anyone who's taken a serious environmental science class knows that
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:38.600]  some of the byproducts from plastic are estrogen mimickers and they really
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.840]  are turning the frogs gay so you know I think that there's like a change a
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.040]  phase change that's happening right now where a lot of the things that people
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.800]  thought were conspiracy theories and wasn't really happening it's like it's
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.520]  coming out and you know this the society that I'm hoping to create is one
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.640]  where we have a free exchange of ideas that come out and that nothing and then
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.400]  that everything can be questioned and that there's nothing that's like off
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.520]  off limits and that's the scary thing of what Google's trying to do is it's
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.040]  trying to make things off limits to talk about. So you're calling for classical
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:15.920]  liberalism so you gentlemen are giving a co-speech here together takeover because
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.520]  I really want to hear what you think's most central he's saying you're the
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:24.480]  new Snowden a big tech I totally agree this this is huge. Well thank you I'm
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:31.440]  honored to have that label yeah you know that's that's why we're here it's like I
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.720]  grew up in the 90s and I had this concept that you judge someone by you know
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.240]  the content of the character and not the color of their skin and I thought that
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.840]  was a really great way to you know to operate it's it's kind of a civic
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:53.080]  nationalism like we're all Americans and somehow the left got deranged and they
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.800]  started abandoning that classical liberalism and getting in towards this
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.240]  concept of judging people by the color of their skin and not by the content of
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:09.240]  their character and so these are the you know these these authoritarians are the
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:14.160]  type the segregationists are the type that I've been you know fighting against
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.280]  my whole life and now it's on the left so we know we got it we got to start
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.400]  addressing that as a problem. Wow that's a heavy statement but totally true sorry
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.520]  sorry go ahead Greg. I was gonna say I mean I actually think that you know there's a
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.760]  lot of abstract issues but the concrete one that got me the most upset was this
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:35.520]  way that they call people racists you know it doesn't matter you know if you
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.800]  have interracial friends you could have an interracial marriage and interracial
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.920]  children it doesn't matter they just use it as a tactic and then you know the
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.120]  governor of Virginia is wearing blackface posing with the KK hate that's fine but
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.080]  everyone else needs to be shut down and I just think of all the concrete things
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.400]  that are the worst thing about this system the way that you can just call
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:58.200]  someone a Nazi or call someone a racist and one side gets to do it to the other
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.320]  side whether it's politics whether it's newspapers or whatever like they've set
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.720]  up a system where a Republican I mean a Democrat can call a Republican racist
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.400]  and that makes sense to everybody oh yeah they call Donald Trump racist all
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.320]  time I mean it's one of the analysis I did you know these are like the newspaper
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:19.080]  says Donald Trump is a racist it's not even like a candidate is saying it so
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:22.880]  just this idea that they're using the notion of racist to control people is the
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:30.720]  concrete issue that has me most upset also and it's the media in go ahead
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.760]  Zach it's the media that's invoking racism and creating it sorry yeah I
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.380]  agree like the New York Times is the most racist you know news publication
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:44.040]  in America right now they're they're they're constantly you know pushing a
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:49.520]  narrative that it's that the problem with America is white people and that
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.240]  everything that Trump says should be interpreted under like this extreme dog
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.240]  whistle and they they take what his words then they like re-imagine what
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:02.640]  his state of mind is and then they push that as if it's objective fact and you
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:08.800]  know like I understand that Trump is you know really polarizing and that he
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.720]  says a lot of things that are on his mind that make people unhappy but anyone
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.480]  going to the Twitter feed and looking at what Donald Trump is posting and then
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:23.280]  looking at like the New York Times is posting and you you know it's what the
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.520]  New York Times is posting is is like pre-World War two Germany exactly that
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.600]  because it's insane it when we come back then let's get into other points you
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.040]  want to make other whistleblowers are getting ready to come forward how you
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.480]  think big text going to respond how you think Congress should respond the
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:45.640]  obvious perjury with Zach Voorhees on Twitter at Perpetual Maniac and Greg

[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.760]  we've got great things like DNA Force Plus but ultimate krill oil has been
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.920]  sold out for four months for whatever reason this became the most popular
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:29.520]  fish oil it's totally full the bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.680]  and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.200]  laboratory process to remove mercury any type of krill oil you get that doesn't

[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.320]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.440]  secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all that it
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:19.200]  is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.640]  freedom from press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.080]  concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:29.840]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:32.800]  wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:36.080]  co-opted by big corporation or billionaire sugar daddies who've been
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.120]  able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.000]  or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.280]  they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.600]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:58.080]  of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth I talk about this
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.440]  on the air and I know it sinks into people but I decided that we're gonna
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.720]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.160]  before all the censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it I would
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.160]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.160]  were and I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.480]  instead the last few years I'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:20.000]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy us supplements because they
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.640]  know how great they are and how wonderful they were and the left always has
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.360]  headlines everywhere Jones sells unapproved supplements he claims or
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:32.760]  supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:35.920]  been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.800]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.840]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.840]  different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:49.640]  Mother Nature but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:57.120]  chest info or store.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:03.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:31.160]  this is history we've got two Google engineers that have the courage to go
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:37.680]  public the first one and the second one others are just leak stuff and they're
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.160]  there together interfacing for the first time live on an alternative system that
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.880]  Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple didn't want to exist they knew it
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.960]  would threaten them in the future if it was here to challenge their information
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:56.960]  dominance so remember it's not about credit it's about celebrating what we've
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:02.800]  got left drugs report.com news wars.com info.com we're trying to build an
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.960]  infrastructure though a lot of it's ham-fisted we don't have the billions
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.280]  dollars to challenge this and history is happening that's why listeners and
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.680]  viewers buying products going to the store getting things you already needed
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:20.520]  info store.com is the reason this is happening and on this platform so that
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:27.520]  people like this have a platform because Zach Voorhees and Greg Coppola they
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.840]  have put this info out and there was almost a total blackout on Greg Coppola
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.600]  there has been a total blackout on Zach Voorhees but like alternate dimensions
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.600]  we're not exaggerating with 200 plus radio stations over a hundred cable and
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.080]  TV stations that we conservatively have over a million real people an hour
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.880]  tuning in now I've had peaks before they censored this where it was ten times
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:54.560]  that doesn't matter it's who's tuning in thought leaders me very the the
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:57.920]  White House other governments and so I wanted you guys are sitting to say the
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:03.760]  15 after I am officially try to stick a you know shock in my mouth and I want
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:07.600]  you guys to go through the perjury what you think should come next other key
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.240]  points and really just give people the data dump of the gestalt of where we
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:16.360]  are and why this is so important people say oh just use something other than
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:20.560]  Google yeah that'd be great but they have 90 plus percent as you know of what's
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.960]  already happening as you said Greg that people just look at what's at the top is
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:29.120]  God and so if you go to there and then they say the Republican Party's
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:33.400]  affiliation in California is the Nazi Party people then and that happened for
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.760]  over a month people believe that so we've just given so much power over to
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:42.440]  this so you guys have the floor both of you Zach Voorhees on Twitter perpetual
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:47.000]  maniac a great couple on Twitter for now a couple under store Gregory what do you
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.720]  think's coming next why did you go public obviously more whistleblowers are
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:55.760]  coming this is an amazing watershed moment so go ahead and take over can
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:01.840]  can I take the lead on this yes so you mentioned that Google listed the
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.960]  Republican Party of California as listing them as having a Nazi ideology
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:13.920]  and I have some insider information on exactly what happens it's not actually
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:20.160]  included in the in the project Veritas disclosure but what I can say about that
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:29.920]  is what happened is is that Wikipedia had this information and Wikipedia was
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:36.360]  vandalized and then Google was using Wikipedia as its source of truth
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.480]  database it's listed as one of its source of truth databases and so this
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:49.160]  information got ingested under the ideology tag and then the the algorithm
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:55.680]  that generates the front page of Google search you know would generate that bit
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:02.080]  of information as if it were true and so as a result of this leak and and the
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:09.160]  Republicans being slandered as you know Nazis there was this outcry and Google
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:13.480]  decided that wow there's so much vandalism in Wikipedia under this ideal
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:21.640]  ideology tag that they just decided to just ban it from all Google search I'll
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:24.520]  jump in here but this is also a bombshell I want to get Mr. Cobble's
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:32.000]  take but that's what you experience is AP put out that I lost a lawsuit they
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.360]  use that to take my banking credit ratings again that I had just gotten
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:38.640]  back proving the other one was a fraud I never wrote the book I didn't lose a
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:42.640]  lawsuit they don't care because they know if you can get a thought leader or as
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:47.320]  you say a trusted source like like AP to say something that is it true that has
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:51.720]  been taken like a conviction a false conviction and then passed on this is so
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:52:02.320]  dangerous yeah I mean it go ahead great I'm sorry I'm on a delay
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:11.200]  yeah I guess what was I gonna say just gonna come back to their racism thing
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.120]  and how I did this kind of two-week study where I was looking at the different
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:19.120]  results you get for Donald Trump and I found like you know they're they're
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:22.560]  calling him a racist all the time I mean you can just it's all in GitHub and I
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:25.880]  was just thinking about like playing that back you know three years and how
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.120]  that's what's been going on for three or four years and just walking around New
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:32.720]  York and you can just kind of see it's like it just kind of you know I never
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:36.480]  actually did a formal study of it and until I did I was like yeah I mean this
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:40.640]  is why New York has been the way it has been for probably four years is because
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.760]  people just you know tech is giving like would the New York Times have any
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:49.680]  credibility at this point like if it wasn't promoted by tech would you know
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.240]  when people are at home they don't want to watch CNN so the the fact that it
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:59.000]  continues to be Google's most trusted resources sort of what keeps this whole
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.600]  thing alive I think if you hadn't had tech you wouldn't have had all this
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:07.080]  racial division I mean let's just say it let's just say there's there's more
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.440]  racial division in this country than probably in the 60s and let's just say
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.840]  it they're foaming in the idea that white people are bad it's mainly white
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.920]  people leading it and there's just massive attacks increasing an incredible
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:23.560]  division that didn't exist before this has been such a nasty snake bite that
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:30.200]  big tech and media have done basically and in my experience like well I mean I
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:37.560]  guess everyone knows this but like people who live within the sort of within
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:41.520]  the cocoon of of like what big tech likes you know they learn about the
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:44.880]  people who liked Donald Trump I mean not to make this partisan but this is like
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.720]  what's been the big issue lately they learn about the people who like Donald
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:51.840]  Trump from the New York Times and from PBS who then say they're white
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.640]  supremacists they like David Duke and this type of stuff that really makes no
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:58.520]  sense and you know for example like when I in 2016 I would go because I was
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.800]  interested in all trouble that'd be good for the economy so I would go to some of
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.160]  these meetups where people were meeting and you know it's like a few blocks from
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:08.000]  the New York Times and half the people are there are not even white they're
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.960]  Asians they're Hispanic they're black they're Jews you know everybody's there
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:16.080]  it's just a couple blocks from the New York Times they could they know right
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:19.160]  they know that it's not white supremacists but they still say it every
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.920]  day and there's people that want prosperity in a future and and who want
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:27.720]  all these secret technologies released and all the medical stuff released exactly
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.800]  go to a Trump event man it's cool people of every color who are really want a
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:36.680]  future and also I mean I mean you know it's complicated how to measure but I
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.240]  would say the economy is better under Trump than under Obama so that's the
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.080]  reason right there I mean anyone who's you know financial situation is better
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:47.840]  they have a reason why it's not racism and then you see the Federal Reserve
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:54.160]  trying to ruin that recovery yeah and and there's just such a discipline of the
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.560]  people who like say work in tech they kind of know that like I think some
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.200]  people say that tech workers are liberal so that produces a liberal product
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:05.040]  there's also the other direction which is I think people just observe what the
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.080]  tech products are doing they hear the CEO saying these products are neutral so
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.320]  then they have to really if you want to be in good standing you want to be loyal
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.200]  and you want to protect your family's financial future you play along with the
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:21.680]  delusion yeah you should learn like if if what if what's coming out of Google
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.640]  News is that Donald Trump's a racist well that must be neutral somehow so then he
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:28.960]  must be a racist and I think that the direction of tech workers learning from
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.000]  the tech products is something that most people don't talk about but I oh you're
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.320]  saying the tech workers are amongst the most brainwashed yes yes that's what
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:40.600]  people have to understand is that they're there they're some of the most
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:47.120]  brainwashed and also there is a pattern of education to make sure that people
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:53.760]  understand that they're fundamentally racist Google had this test called the
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.720]  implicit association test which was discredited and they eventually
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:04.920]  terminated the project but every year employees would sign up for this IAT
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:10.640]  test implicit association test and the test would tell you how racist you are
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:14.960]  by figuring out your response times to certain questions that were asked
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.960]  well they can program the test however they want to then make you feel guilty
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.440]  so you submit to the fact that you're a thought criminal yep and the thing is is
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:29.120]  that once people realize oh I'm a bad person then they they seek like an
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:33.800]  atonement through you know doing something that's like anti-racist
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.520]  which means submitting to their agenda has nothing to do with it you can
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:43.520]  counteract that oh that the chai comms have two million ethnic workers in a
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.400]  enforced labor and they're killing them oh don't say because that that just short
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:54.600]  circuits the whole conundrum yep let me raise this actually sorry go ahead I
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:59.320]  actually it's very interesting sort of people who are kind of in this leftist
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.280]  motif of thinking if you say something that they haven't heard or that doesn't
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:06.720]  fit with you know because they're so used to hearing the New York Times
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.040]  characterize their opponents that if you say something that doesn't make sense
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:11.880]  it's almost like they just don't even register it I've I've witnessed this like
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:16.440]  you know just exactly they get in a rut of the same chance so you're telling them
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:22.200]  they're like what is that space alien talk with yeah like also I'm for free
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:26.200]  markets and universal basic income you know and they just to them socialism
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:29.280]  means that the government is providing the services and so if you just talk
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.160]  with universities like they just can't process the time let's just give someone
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.800]  a check rather than a service they're just like why do you want to help them
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:38.920]  you know and they just they will talk about that when we come back and talk
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.680]  about the perjury and talk about how they're targeting minorities wait till
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:49.480]  you see these secret documents Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.280]  that when our Republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.400]  close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living that would
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.080]  end up saving the nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned all US
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:06.440]  farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.000]  the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.440]  our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.840]  gonna back down so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.560]  world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never gonna
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:27.600]  give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit the human spirit lives

[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:07.640]  now the Greg Topol of the highest level engineer from Google for public and then
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:15.080]  Zach Voorhees who I was saying what we're saying that Voorhees is the Ed
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:21.680]  Snowden of leaks from Big Tech he is and and Greg Coppola certified that so
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:24.680]  this is short segment long segment coming up gentlemen let's get into the
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:29.840]  perjury though when you see Sundar Pachago and say we've never manipulated
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:33.000]  any search well everybody knows you can pay to have stuff manipulated you can
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.440]  put ads on it that they did it in the WikiLeaks for Hillary so just the lies
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:41.960]  you talked about this Greg Coppola and I want to get Zach's take on it but one
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:45.040]  of the big places you really got him angry you was saying look their perjury
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.880]  themselves to Congress I know well even a layperson knows they're doing that but
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:53.080]  give us some specifics well I mean I'm not a minor either I'm not a lawyer I
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:56.360]  don't know about perjury I'm just saying it's not true well tell us what's a lie
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:04.400]  yeah perjury is a lie right so the thing is like there's this real emphasis on
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:07.840]  trusted partners you know and those trusted partners you know if you look
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.400]  at them you take the top 20 you know they're they're just slight variations on
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.680]  the same theme I mean there they're basically you know everything that's
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.000]  gonna you know come out of Google News is from like a certain you know circle
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.680]  it's a circle I was about to say circle shirt yeah it's a certain within a Venn
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:30.000]  diagram there's a certain you know I don't want to you know it's you know
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.800]  it's 20% of possible thought or something like that you know it's not the
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.600]  whole range and you know the natural conclusion that everybody's like so the
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:41.320]  default is they're picking what you get so to claim the Congress we haven't fixed
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.520]  results is just a ridiculous lie it's like saying you know we're politically
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:50.160]  neutral but our most trusted sources are huff post political and the New York
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.120]  Times but it's you know we're not taking political size I mean I don't even know
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:59.840]  what that means it's just beyond whopper level lies yeah I would say yeah
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.400]  there's no there's no way you can call it politically neutral I mean there's no
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.880]  way I mean here's here's a thing right like you got the CEO of Google and he's
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:11.800]  telling Congress we don't use blacklist and then the full-time engineers
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.080]  inside the company could just go on to MoMA which is the internal search engine
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:21.200]  and do a search for blacklist and then have the blacklist show up and they've
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:25.440]  been called a blacklist that they actually called it a blacklist and it
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:30.640]  was actually available to every single full-time employee in the company
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.660]  wow please continue because I mean you're the Snowden of this these
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:39.880]  documents you released little birdies told me you have even more no all of it
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.440]  was uh all of it was uh was disclosed with project Veritas I hadn't has to be
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.520]  that way for operational security I mean little birdies told me you you know
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:54.240]  other people that are getting ready to go public though yeah I I don't want to
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:59.520]  comment on that because it's ongoing but yeah there's there's a lot of people
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.400]  that are upset about what's you know been happening and for them they've been
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.720]  worried that if they come out and disclose these documents that they'll be
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:12.120]  targeted by Google's ruthless machine and you have talked to other people that
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.400]  have had their entire lives ruined well let's talk about that I mean you guys
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.640]  you are the real men I'm not kissing your ass like I don't care about sports
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:22.120]  guys I care about it like when I go sleeping I'm thinking man those guys
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.200]  are really cool well you you guys have put a lot on the line you've gone through
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.760]  a lot they sent cops to your house didn't they Zach yeah yeah exactly and the
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:34.360]  thing is is that in order for us all to have this conversation you know about
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:38.580]  Google we can't you know the whistleblowers can't be worried about what
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:42.800]  documents have or have not been released into the public that are sensitive you
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:47.920]  know and so I was able to find a you know a large cross-section of documents
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.280]  detailing the censorship machine and now we can talk about it without everyone
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:55.800]  else can talk about it without violating their their NDA sure you're just giving
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:02.400]  us the general operating manuals not to find my new show that name names it's
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:07.480]  a little bit a little bit both actually and and I actually want to take this
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:12.760]  this moment to apologize to some people that were inadvertently leaked out that
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:18.320]  wasn't my intention it was it was that the disclosure went in there and I want
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:21.920]  to apologize a little too much was released well here's the thing so many
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.720]  people never take action because they want to be perfect it God judges the
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.760]  heart my friend the big the big mainframe judges the heart your
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.120]  intention has been good yeah my intentions were pure my intentions were

[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:23.840]  making everybody says history this history that no it's history making
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:29.560]  that we have this platform and defines the establishment that without YouTube
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:34.800]  without Google the interview on our servers our live stream servers and the
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:40.280]  other videos yesterday this morning had 2.3 million views now sure these
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:43.480]  interviews in the old days that probably five million on YouTube but the point is
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:47.240]  we built our own system and people are using it and folks are buying a product
[02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:51.600]  from us and stuff we pay for the bandwidth because the bills are big I'm
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:56.200]  always like whoa that video had 14 million views that bill is gonna be big
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:59.320]  but here we are building our own thing like Matt dredge came here four years
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:04.760]  ago and warned us to do Greg Coppola on Twitter Coppola underscore Gregory he's
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:07.840]  shadow banned because of what he did you got to go to his actual Twitter to hear
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:11.680]  what he says you have to hand type it in Coppola underscore Gregory you got Zach
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:16.720]  Voorhees perpetual maniac on Twitter as well again my son went on Twitter his
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:21.920]  own site not even info wars 10,000 in two hours he's been on a few months is at
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:26.720]  12,000 now it's so again it's the shadow ban it's not letting you compete it's
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:30.280]  not letting you on the field it's not competitive it's not American it's not
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:35.280]  pro-human it's not even if you take the term evolutionary it's stunting that it's
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:38.400]  saying there's no survival the fittest here we don't let you actually compete so
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:45.440]  gentlemen I was mentioning before the break about you were getting into how
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:49.720]  they target people on their race how they know how a person swipes you've
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:53.480]  released all the documents how they're spying on everybody there's more than
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:56.280]  one way to skin a cat I don't want to get involved with corporations and
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:59.400]  trouble they say and do but when they're bigger than governments and then let
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:04.080]  China and and others create the regulations because we won't the first
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:08.160]  amendment is a regulation saying you won't prohibit so we need that to be
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:12.160]  enforced instead of letting China and the EU come in because we won't pass laws
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:17.600]  saying no or enforce our laws how do we say no to the election meddling how do
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:21.240]  we say no to the working with foreign powers that Peter Thiel and you and
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:24.880]  others are been exposing that that that Google's involved in who wants to take
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:36.640]  that first mr. Coppola mr. Voorhees you want to yeah so you know I feel that you
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.120]  know coming out has been a very interesting experience because what I
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:45.400]  realized is that Google can see pretty much every single thing that I do online
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:51.480]  right like there's they can see what I do because I use Gmail they can see how I
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:57.520]  browse because I use Chrome you know they you know it's really hard to get away
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:01.360]  even when I want to write a document for notes that that is a Google doc like
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:07.000]  I'm attached it's almost like part of my brain and for me it's the the getting
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  rid of that I could Google fasting like I I don't I'm ditching Google in every
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.600]  single aspect of my life and it turns out that there's actually really great
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.400]  services out there like proton mail in a lot of ways is better than so it's a
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.040]  process of like divorce I don't know if you can get to this yet you and your
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:28.840]  colleague who I really want and and the Defense Department stuff but you I mean
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:31.840]  this has happened to me you're so like man they're listing the phone they're
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.600]  reading what I say because they're countering you in real time before you
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:37.240]  go public I mean are you ready to go public with that because they admit
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:40.240]  they're doing it but this is warfare level stuff they've got a team of
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:43.960]  probably 50 people on you right now but that's an honor you can now probably
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.920]  leave some of them out of darkness do you kind of see that priest position
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.280]  you're in now you know what it's very hard to convince a true believer they
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:58.680]  kind of have to see like they had to get targeted before they kind of wake up so
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:02.440]  you know as far as the programming the true believers I mean they're gonna have
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:06.360]  to come and wake up you know on their on their own what I'm aiming for is I'm
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:11.800]  aiming for the people in America that understand what's going on but they're
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:16.480]  being slandered by the establishment players as conspiracy theorists and you
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.920]  know in order to fix our elections we have to fix middle America we have to
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:26.240]  like let them know that these big tech giants are hostile entities and that
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:31.520]  they've got to start the process of moving off of those platforms and if
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.160]  we're not using Google to you know browse the web if we're not using Google to
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.400]  actually you're preaching the drudge doctrine because for ten years he said
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.920]  get out of the gulags run build your own thing decentralized we have to get it
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:46.080]  off of the gulags that's right that's a fair drug I think deserves the credit I
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:52.200]  think Matt drudges we don't as the drudge doctrine yeah we have to make that
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.360]  personal Greg yeah I just wanted to say I mean I don't know about regulation but
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:00.960]  I would really emphasize the importance of free market solutions you know anyone
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.720]  who believes in the free market in general I think and just as someone who
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.040]  builds ranking algorithms all the time or has you know there's really a lot of
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:11.400]  personality that goes into a good algorithm and I don't think you can
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.160]  take somebody who doesn't want to make you a product and regulate them into
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:17.080]  making a product it's like right now the products sort of don't have any
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:20.240]  personality as it is and you're gonna have the government start regulating them
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.200]  I mean this is like not anywhere near as good as just having competitors that
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.360]  can arrive at top lawyers call me and say hey Trump's about to take action I
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:31.480]  said this drafts a nightmare you can't have government that knows how to deal
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:36.440]  with sick cuss words it bans and have it understand algorithms this is insane
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:42.260]  yeah I mean you're a GDR so I go ahead GDR which is already just like a
[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:45.200]  hassle for anyone that just you know it's like oh I want to throw up a new
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:48.320]  social network well you know now if someone in Europe's gonna see you got
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:52.680]  to like read through the entire GDPR thing and comply with it I mean GDPR is
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:56.840]  really a gift to big companies because they just have people sitting around you
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:00.440]  know on the payroll they are well you look into the GDPR thing and they're
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:03.880]  probably never gonna bust it for anyway so you know I mean there's an excuse to
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:06.840]  spy so let me ask you this getting into algorithms we got to keep going no you
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:10.600]  guys got to go this is so historic I'm another guest be pushed back but getting
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:13.920]  into algorithms all I know is if something's popular the old algorithm
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:17.600]  was it gets promoted to people that already liked that genre so the
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:20.600]  algorithm just knows how to target people what they want giving them what
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  they want like a PKD wirehead plugging them into the pleasure centers I mean
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.280]  isn't that really it well I don't know what you're saying I mean we want people
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:33.760]  to get what they want I think I'm just saying that like you can't take you can't
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:37.000]  take a product you can't you know someone doesn't want to give one you know
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.200]  someone in your audience wasn't saying isn't a good algorithm just giving
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.720]  people what they want I mean that's what you know instead of force feeding them
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:48.840]  that's not an algorithm right historically there was a focus on the user
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:52.280]  and that meant giving the user what they want I think that's sort of changed now
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:56.040]  to like making sure that the user doesn't think anything wrong which is a
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:59.240]  completely different approach to having a company wow that was the heaviest thing
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.640]  I've heard like a year exactly and people are trying to throw this up they
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:08.280]  don't want this yeah I mean I don't even really have a place now I can go and
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.800]  like definitely just like a newsfeed that would just send me stuff that I like
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:14.840]  like you know YouTube recommendations like I don't just I can't just browse
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.560]  YouTube recommendations I find stuff that I like you know I think um oh you see
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:25.920]  it all now it's just force fed go to sleep stuff yeah but I mean really you
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:29.840]  know a lot of these companies I mean search is a difficult thing I actually
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:33.200]  use duck duck go first and then I use Google if that doesn't work but
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.320]  basically you know Facebook and Twitter and Instagram these all started with
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.000]  small teams it's really important to remember that small teams that they were
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.200]  not if there was no anti-competitive practices I think they could you know
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.040]  that they could make cool products so very easily that would work a lot better
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.760]  than and that's what Bill Gates said he's always been worried about small
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:53.400]  companies and people like you building new things but you said these
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.120]  anti-competitive practice where they call any site that they don't control a
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:01.720]  Nazi it gives you platformed or they buy it up how do we stop that
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:06.720]  are we exposed to the free market I think they're being propped up I think
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:12.440]  distorting the free market I think that when the free market is returned that
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:17.840]  big tech will be tamed because they they'll realize that if they're gonna
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:25.640]  censor us then we're gonna censor them well and I mean that's really it sorry
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:29.440]  but I was gonna say half of America is really being kind of antagonized by
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:32.880]  tech parts they're not happy it's the same thing in every country so shouldn't
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:35.360]  somebody be able to get rich off of this and just catering to these other
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.640]  people if you know there really was a free market well that's what's been said
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:42.320]  what if Trump or others got together and promoted a new startup everyone would
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:46.320]  leave immediately that's the Achilles heel there's no bloody revolution there's
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:53.240]  no lawsuits there's no antitrust just okay Google okay Apple F you yeah I think
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:56.160]  it's really interesting also like the campaign finance angle because it's
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:59.680]  like you know everything's a campaign finance violation but then for Google
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:03.160]  and Facebook to be part of the Democrat Party that's not even considered so like
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:06.120]  you know what if Donald Trump had a social network that was actually making
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.880]  money and helped his campaign they'd probably shut that down but they don't
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.720]  but Facebook's allowed to just be part of the day well let me be the first to
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.880]  offer you gentlemen together once a week whenever you want a two-hour show to see

[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:30.640]  would have been turned against us I'll ask you in the break you got to go I
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:36.000]  understand whether Zach or Greg can stay together but this is history making two
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.480]  senior Google engineers at a whistleblower the first two publicly
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:44.640]  coming together live on info wars if that isn't radioactive kryptonite to

[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:16.920]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.320]  having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:24.240]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:27.480]  move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:31.880]  might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory so here's

[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:05.640]  that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:09.080]  that would end up saving the nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.320]  all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.160]  support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:23.360]  pressure on our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't going to be bullied
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:28.040]  and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the Hillary

[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:28.480]  Final segment with these incredible guests Greg Coppola, Zach Voorhees,
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:33.960]  follow Zach at Twitter at Perpetual Maniac, Twitter for Mr. Coppola,
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:39.160]  Coppola underscore Gregory and take pleasure in not getting his alerts, take
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:45.960]  pleasure in not getting his updates. I get all of the Ben Shapiro updates, I get
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:51.080]  all of the establishment Republican updates, I get none of the updates the
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:55.280]  good guys because I you know obviously have a account on Twitter and I don't
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:58.160]  really tweet but I do it the follow stuff and have instant messaging you
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:02.720]  don't know it's all being surveilled and you just notice whoever's really good
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:05.920]  you're not gonna you're not gonna just get fed to you you're gonna have to go
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:10.840]  find the good stuff in that common sense in the way the universe works like you
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:14.440]  don't find the diamond you don't just find the best wife or the best husband
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:17.920]  you don't just find that four leaf clover you got to look around for the
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:21.840]  four leaf clover. I was a kid I used to love four leaf clovers and the clover
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.280]  would grow in Dallas I'd look for like an hour and I finally find a four leaf
[02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:29.440]  clover that's kind of what it's like you know and it's a reawakening of humanity
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:36.320]  it's a magic moment so Zach and Greg hearing closing how do you expect big
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:40.400]  tech to strike back they've been very arrogant for 30 years no one's regulated
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:44.600]  them but now because China and the EU are coming in through that vacuum and
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:48.960]  regulating Congress is gonna take action Trump's to take action the danger is and
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:53.160]  I'm not being elitist but these guys are all busy and then most of them are 70
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:56.680]  years older older they mainly watch TV but now they know the internet's big but
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:00.440]  they still don't get it I'm worried big tech will do back doors like we're
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:04.320]  already seeing and give them regulatory powers that are even worse I so we need
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:07.280]  to get guys like you in front of Congress I think is what's the plan of
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:10.760]  action let's talk about plans of action with both of you let's go to Greg
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:16.480]  Coppola first Greg what's plans of action here well I mean first of all I'm
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:20.840]  really curious when when they're gonna like when they're gonna admit that Zach
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:24.080]  leaks have happened I mean like I mean I'm talking about the mainstream media
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:28.040]  here you know that could be an interesting thing and just like what's
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.040]  gonna happen when they have to say you know this actually happened weeks ago
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:35.600]  that's actually all these things and we just didn't tell you and these you know
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:38.120]  they're alleging that there's a system of censorship and we didn't tell you what
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:44.600]  for two weeks I mean is that gonna kind of get anyone thinking I don't know and
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:49.080]  secondly I think you know I would just underline that was Zach's dump I mean I
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:52.080]  think you've really seen everything now it's all I don't even think we need
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:55.200]  another leak I mean I'm sure some people are looking for it and and some people
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:58.080]  might leak other things that are interesting but I actually don't even
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:01.320]  think that we need anything else and I think it's really important for
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:05.920]  consumers to just say like look there's a bias we can see it everything's up by
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:09.520]  hand it's nothing to do with computers at all and well that's it you just said
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.320]  something's I love talking to you guys with 150 IQs 160 because exactly
[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:19.200]  everybody's always the next dump the next piece the next what do you need when
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.400]  you have them saying blacklist and they've lied to Congress and said there
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:28.640]  aren't with specific names my names and others names it's all right there we have
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:34.480]  them smoking gun bigger than Dallas and it's there we've got it's a pile of
[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:40.880]  smoking guns as big as Mount Everest is what you're saying I mean I don't I don't
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:43.960]  see what else any we anyone would really need at this point I mean someone
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:47.000]  might I'm sure there's interesting stuff but it's time to just know it's like
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.440]  Monty Python when the night that goes knit has had all his arms and legs cut
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:54.480]  off it's like it's done wire no more getting obsessed with like target
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:57.800]  fixation like when the world war two you fly over a train and shoot it already
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:01.360]  blew up you'd still just keep shooting and fly into it we've already blown it
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:06.240]  up it's it's like we have the tools I think that's what he's saying Zach yeah
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:10.000]  I mean it's kind of like the meme where there's like a dog in the building and
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.520]  everything's on fire and he's just you know saying oh yeah everything's fine you
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:21.480]  know the American people have had a fire woken up in them and I think that
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:26.320]  they're really going to you know I have a conversation with the representative
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:31.560]  and you know that representative is going to come back for recess and they're
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:36.640]  gonna be energized to you know start working through what the solutions are
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:43.560]  and you know there's think tanks that are have deeper knowledge and free trade
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:50.560]  you know I'm I'm a computer scientist I'm not an economist and you know we're
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:56.000]  gonna have a period where we can all get together and figure out you know what
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.040]  needs to be done and you know even if there was another leak like I don't
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:04.960]  think it would even be news because they're this leak that I provided has
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:12.880]  been so comprehensive you know people can find out if their favorite influencers
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:19.440]  have been blacklisted for example I just wrote a medium post describing how
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:25.920]  Luke Wodowski over at We Are Changed like what you know the fact that he
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:29.480]  showed up in a blacklist and exactly what that means for him and we are
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.560]  changed as a journalistic liberal group that I helped launch that exposes
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:37.160]  George Bush for war crimes I mean like you said they're suppressing the left as
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:40.400]  well any real leftist they're actually doing something real they suppressed
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:47.840]  them yeah you know I was I was attacked by Antifa because I disrupted one of
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:52.880]  their events when they tried to take over Occupy Wall Wall Street and you know
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:58.440]  they they gave me death threats and it's really funny because I've done more
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:05.400]  against fascism than all of them combined well that's what I'm saying is I'm a
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:08.720]  classical liberal these terms mean nothing I want truth like Martin Luther
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:13.440]  King like you said man I believe in that and they are going against that why do
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:16.720]  you think they betrayed it you call it derangement but it was programmed that
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:20.280]  way it's in the WikiLeaks the professor tells Hillary we got to go to culture
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:24.440]  war even worse than we've done and so why are they betting on culture war like
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:31.040]  it's so horrible so racist yeah so you know the best can I answer this so the
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:39.920]  best video that I've ever found that describes what's going on is a video by
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:47.680]  a Russian dissident named Yuri Besmanov and he detailed he was responsible in
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:54.320]  the KGB for subverting a civilization and so he spilled all the secrets in a
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:59.360]  video that exists on the internet called Yuri Besmanov just search for him you'll
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.760]  find it and he basically lays out these four steps for ideological subversion
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.880]  and it starts off with demoralization and then it goes to
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.720]  destabilization which is where we're at now and then there's a crisis period
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:15.720]  which is you know you see a lot of these things are happening in the news and
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:18.720]  they're they're they're trying to force a crisis especially with the Federal
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:25.200]  Reserve jacking up interest rates and then during that crisis that gives the
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:31.640]  revolutionaries the justification to take over you know subvert the Bill of
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:36.320]  Rights or whatever the Constitution that country has and then and then the
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:40.800]  society goes to a new normal and that's called normalization so that's that
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:44.160]  that's in the cloud and pivot plan and all of it incredible you guys are
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:49.200]  amazing a great couple you were trying to jump in there go ahead I was gonna say
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:52.480]  the social justice thing is a motif I don't think it's a genuine ideology but
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:56.280]  I mean I think in terms of next steps I think everyone should just you know
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:59.160]  conclude that what's happening what they thought was happening is happening and
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:02.640]  you know that'll just create a market for new products and I just want to
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.160]  underline that you know precocious child can create a new social network there's
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:10.520]  nothing really technically difficult about doing that well how does it feel to
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:13.320]  there'll be in the vanguard of history both of you I know you're just doing it
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.880]  so right thing to do you feel the energy can you feel do you feel it yeah I
[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:22.120]  actually do I feel it yeah and then did you ever feel anything like that at
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:35.560]  Google it's a different opposite so both of you feel it don't you yeah it's
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.400]  entirely reversed right like the energy is opposite like in Google I had this
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.560]  feeling that everything was going wrong and now hold on both of you got to
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.720]  finish I want I'm gonna finish with one more comment about the spirit because
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.880]  once you feel it there's no going back
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:58.440]  attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency solar

[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:05.840]  will be the most important message you'll ever hear Bill Hyde here I want to
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:09.440]  tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:13.280]  microgrid system that's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:17.000]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.400]  having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:24.320]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:27.560]  move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.960]  might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory so here's
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:35.840]  what you should do right now check out the PPX microgrid system at my own

[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:01.960]  years ago that when our Republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:05.960]  that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:09.400]  that would end up saving the nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:14.640]  all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls
[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:19.480]  support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:24.200]  pressure on our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:28.800]  aren't gonna back down so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the

[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:46.400]  can ascend to some silicon ai god jack Voorhees is the Edward Snowden of
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:50.640]  whistleblowing inside big tech the bombshell broke with project veritas
[02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:56.400]  two days ago exploded yesterday and now has gone supernova Greg Coppola helped
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:34:00.040]  lead the charge is the most senior engineer to go public so far pointing
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:03.760]  out the elephant in the room incredible lies so in closing I want to ask both of
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:10.000]  you starting out with Zach Voorhees you talk about a weight off your soul that's
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:15.400]  the thing is that when you serve evil the yacht or the women don't it's not
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:19.080]  pleasurable now if you serve good you don't even want those things not they're
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:22.560]  bad it's just that they're nothing because you're tied into the cosmos the
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:26.040]  universe humanity and I haven't talked to you previously about this but I have
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:29.080]  seen you speak to it can you talk about you got caught up on the break about
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:33.740]  what it's like to be even unconsciously serving evil your subconscious is more
[02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:38.080]  powerful it's a supercomputer it knows you're part of something bad versus when
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:44.960]  you get in line with the truth what that what that transition was like yeah so
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:48.640]  there's about six years I was asleep within the company and in the last two
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:55.120]  years it was fully awake and that that that process started and what's it
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:59.080]  started you know I remember the last thing thinking to myself what else are
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:05.440]  they lying about and that was it wow you know bam like it just came and for two
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:11.680]  years I was really really really suffering being inside of YouTube and
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:17.200]  Google because Google owns YouTube and seeing the company transform like this
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:24.120]  there's actually a mass shooting at YouTube and my co-worker had to like
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:29.960]  dodge out of the way to miss the bullets and I came down and saw that the
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.200]  shot or had shot themselves and when everything happened the reason the
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:38.000]  reason that came out that this person had you know done this mass shooting is
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:44.400]  that they were demonetized I remember that and we're not saying that was good
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:48.680]  but they did but it was it was the dehumanization created the desperation
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:52.560]  these are people caught up in a digital gulags what you're saying so what if you
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:55.640]  felt like like you said a weight was lifted off your soul and what is the
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:36:05.160]  feeling like now you know I I felt really guilty about drawing a salary and I
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:10.200]  tried to let people know that this that this was coming and now that I've
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:15.720]  released all the information I realized I'm not part of that evil evil system
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:22.200]  anymore and it's very uplifting and I feel that I can you know make my maker
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:28.480]  meet my maker at the very end and when he says you came across evil what did you
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:32.600]  do and I'll be able to like look and run in the eye and said I sacrificed
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:38.440]  everything to let the American people know that the AI weapons were pointed
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.440]  directly at their mind wow
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:49.040]  Zach Voorhees the super charismatic smart Edward Snowden of Google thank you
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:52.600]  so much sir we salute you please come back anytime please come to town both of
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:57.280]  you guys thank you we salute you Greg Coppola who helped start this chain
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:01.520]  reaction your comment on your journey and you know you're suspended they're
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:05.400]  coming after you but you seem uplifted what is the process that's all you nodding
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:09.240]  when he was talking about feeling empowered you feel the same way yeah
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:13.120]  first of all I'm not sure if I'm actually more senior than Zach but yeah I
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:18.880]  describe you as a senior long-term engineer on major algorithms yeah I mean I
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:21.520]  don't know we could argue about it was more senior all day but I would say
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:27.720]  that yeah I definitely believe in energy karma reincarnation that kind of
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:34.080]  stuff so there is kind of like a karmic duty to you know I think when I was
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:39.600]  comfortably drawing my paycheck I felt you know more comfortable more certain
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:44.720]  now I feel there's definitely a lot of uncertainty but I feel more alerts and
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:49.120]  obviously yeah I mean just you know just the fact that I'm not anonymous kind of
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:51.560]  makes life a little more dangerous so it's just kind of actually making me a
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:59.520]  little bit more awake awake means alive oh yeah more live yeah come down the
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:03.960]  path further my friend it only gets better and the discernment that opens up
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:08.440]  talk about AI God's AI I'm not gonna get into on there but it's it's getting
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:13.840]  really scary actually I mean I'm gonna talk about it on there but people have
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.160]  to experience it for themselves and it's it's amazing it's incredible and it's
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:22.720]  scary but the truth is scary and the system knows this they're trying to
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:26.440]  create a system to shudder humanity so we don't realize our full potential but
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:31.240]  I think both of you are really smart men and your leaders and your heroes and so
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:34.520]  I want to salute you both thanks for spending so much time with us today
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:39.080]  thank you for everything you do Alex thank you and nice talking back nice
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.560]  not yeah you got you guys want to exchange numbers or anything in there in
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:46.920]  the control room and I know you're talking okay yeah we have his number
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:51.440]  all right we'll give each other okay thank you gentlemen thank you thank you
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:55.480]  there's nothing wrong with yachts there's nothing wrong with beautiful women
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:00.120]  there's nothing wrong with a 900 horsepower car but let me tell you it
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:06.120]  doesn't come close to promoting real human destiny and promoting a human
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:13.200]  future it's so rewarding to stand up against this force and so many people
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:20.040]  seem so enslaved they have never tasted they have never imagined communing with
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:26.440]  God the higher-level and if you just once ever touch it you'll never want
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.480]  anything else again it's not like Christians you talk about real
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.240]  Christians not fake ones about you know I'm here alive but I can't wait to be
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:40.520]  with the Lord I can't wait to give they don't want to die in fact that most of
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.840]  them are the longest-lived people over 100 years old a lot of Christians are
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:45.880]  the longest-lived people because they're willing to give up their flesh with the
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:51.600]  flesh hangs on because they're already touching heaven and I'm telling you
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:56.560]  folks there's a whole new universe waiting for you and that something's happening
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:02.080]  here the enemy knew it was coming but we didn't believe their lies we held the
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:05.280]  course you held the course Leo Zagami's been holding for 39 minutes I
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:10.240]  apologize to him he's an amazing author researcher and one of the greatest
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:13.960]  trailblazers out there I know I used to read his stuff 15 years ago and I thought
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:18.760]  this guy's nuts everything he said came true about two popes and and and how
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:23.440]  be this new pope and he turned me around Rome and now he's been run out of Italy
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:28.800]  and he joins us now Leo you've got big news about the deputy pope and the
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:35.560]  pedophilia and Epstein but I can feel the energy right now and I know evil's
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:39.360]  powerful and then they're gonna come back but I feel like there's a great
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:44.800]  empowerment I feel very strong right now I feel the Holy Spirit very strong not
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:48.560]  just in me personally at a baby level when Holy Spirit touches you and you but
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:54.360]  I feel it reaching out and we're gonna win what I know is we're gonna win in
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:58.640]  the end it's gonna be rough but I can time warp mentally and see the future
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:01.800]  and we're going to win we're gonna go to the stars we're gonna go interdimensional
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:06.200]  we're gonna win but what would you call this period we're in right now is the
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.760]  power of prayer Alex that is putting together all of us simple warriors
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:16.440]  against a clearly demonic force so it's this aggregate that we are creating to
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:21.080]  oppose their own aggregate which is which means fourth form so we are
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:26.880]  definitely fighting an epic battle which was prophesied but you said it we're
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:31.800]  little G like God we can envision the future we're here together they don't
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:36.240]  want us to come together we're coming together envisioning a good future yes
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:40.280]  because when you get more than a person together and you start praying you
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:46.080]  manifest things and that happens especially if you use then the mighty
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:51.800]  name of Jesus then it incentivates of this and makes it fear that name Jesus
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:57.120]  so much that they really fear it yes because Jesus was the biggest well it
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:01.720]  was a manifestation of God and the biggest exorcist of all times it was him
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.480]  who actually actually started to exercise these demonic forces and gave us
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.120]  the keys to exercise them 2,000 years ago so it's very important that we follow
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.960]  his teachings to fight now he kicked their ass up one side now the other they
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:21.560]  fear him because he defeated them yes just mentioning his name and in this
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:29.440]  legions legion of Satan and just see it seems to go in a panic mode like all
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.240]  these pedophiles are going in a panic they flee from the name of Christ they
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:38.880]  flee Jesus Christ it's our Lord and Savior they flee they do I've seen it
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:43.120]  they flee from the name no other name has any effect that's why you know it has
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:48.520]  the power Jesus Christ of Nazareth would have been a rabbi that he changed the
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:54.440]  whole course of history he became a Christian stay with Thomas Jefferson
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:59.480]  predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:03.200]  future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:06.920]  who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:12.000]  the communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.240]  massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.680]  this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.200]  Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't gonna back down so to the
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:28.240]  walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:32.360]  intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never gonna give up and all
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:36.560]  you've done is awaken the human spirit the human spirit lives at info wars
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:41.200]  dot com and news works dot com and I'm asking listeners whatever you do spread
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:45.320]  those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:49.840]  we are 1776 worldwide
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:57.240]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:00.560]  become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:04.040]  of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:07.520]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:10.400]  members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:13.360]  members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:17.040]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:20.560]  will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:23.960]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:27.280]  economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:31.240]  Depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light of
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:35.520]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:39.280]  make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.720]  big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:46.200]  meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:48.960]  telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:52.680]  gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:59.040]  just saw without your support we won't be here and I couldn't thank you all
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:02.040]  enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game and I want to stay in this
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:05.160]  game I want to take the globalist on total transparency is our whole
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:09.640]  operation if I bring in $35 million half of that's the cost of the products we
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:12.800]  don't mark stuff up that much I don't care if I'm not making money but you
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.560]  need to buy the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:20.200]  great toothpaste we've got great things like DNA force plus but ultimate
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:23.600]  krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever reason this became
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:27.640]  the most popular fish oil it's totally full of bottle and it is the strongest
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:32.120]  purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put through
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:36.600]  the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any type of krill oil you
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.000]  get that doesn't give you fish burps which I don't like but gives you all
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.160]  the great benefits isn't real it's been boiled it's been ruined it's been a

[02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:02.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:14.680]  one cannot describe it you have to see it it's like the matrix
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:22.280]  and I'm here only off in the red pill nothing else but if you take Jesus Christ
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:27.840]  there was no doubt that the house of Solomon the house of King David before
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:31.760]  him was touched by God and the information given to them was definitely
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:37.520]  off-world but then Jesus decided to try to give that information to everybody
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:44.880]  and to and to and to empower humanity and so the system killed him but you can
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:49.200]  be a Christian you have to go out amongst the globalists the left and talk
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:53.640]  about America being great they they recoil they act like you've thrown
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:48:01.560]  holy water on Linda Blair in the exorcist but you say Jesus they run you
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:06.480]  say America they fight you they get upset you say Jesus they run and again I
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:09.960]  grew up Christian and I was like oh is this really real whatever and then you
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.760]  get around evil and you see the same stuff and you're like what something's
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:17.920]  going on what is this well God's not gonna put us here on this planet and not
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:25.360]  give us a cheat sheet so what happened in the Middle East and what happened is
[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:29.680]  very very special you know we can focus on the big top cardinal right-hand man
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:33.000]  in the pope being a pedophile and being in the court coming out we can focus on
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.520]  Epstein we can focus on the Clintons but we know we know who the devils are
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:41.800]  now everybody knows they broke his neck they killed him and we'll talk about
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:44.160]  that with our guests a little bit in the next hour and the next house took
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:52.240]  over and Leo Zagami Leo Zagami comms here but Leo talk about Jesus because the
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:56.040]  enemy put all these fake devil worshipers on national TV to downgrade
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:59.640]  Christianity and act like idiots to make people turn against God but people see
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:05.680]  through that but there's something powerful in the name of Jesus Christ and
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:08.360]  and I'm not gonna get in my own personal life but things that have happened but
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:11.800]  I've been through some things I've seen some things the enemies thrown a lot of
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:17.520]  stuff at me and man you see the name Jesus Christ and ask Jesus for help it's
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:23.360]  like the Red Sea Sparks and it's like all these Oprah women people want the
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:27.360]  secret then all these occultists do all this bad stuff to get power from the
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:33.080]  devil but if you believe in Jesus Christ and call on Jesus Christ he is so
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:38.440]  powerful it's almost I'm like ashamed to even call on that name because it's so
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:41.800]  I mean can you speak about Jesus Christ then we'll get into the big breaking news
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:47.440]  a little bit in the next hour Jesus has been really the force that has empowered
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:54.520]  the good side of American politics since 1935 when Abram Everde founded the
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:50:00.240]  fellowship that of course then was followed by Douglas Coe who did the
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:06.160]  incredible work around the world in the name of Jesus always so the name of Jesus
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:10.960]  has opened many doors also for America like you said earlier if you talk about
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:15.480]  America they might have an aggressive stand but at times the diplomacy of the
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:20.400]  United States this the secret diplomacy went through people that instead put in
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:26.240]  front the name of Jesus like the Douglas Coe so the US intelligence agencies
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:31.440]  for they got taken over we're all Christians yes and as I said there is
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:37.160]  been a secretive let's say very reserved the Christian organization that has
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:42.280]  never really surfaced in the media known as the fellowship and also as the
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:47.520]  family of course not related to the satanic family of Charles Manson which
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:52.720]  has really worked to make the name of Jesus powerful among Christian leaders
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:57.720]  like you are showing Ron Reagan was a good friend of a Douglas Coe but many
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:03.160]  other powerful leaders at one point the Douglas Coe went even to Libya to talk
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:07.960]  with Muammar Gaddafi who was completely furious with the United States because
[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:13.240]  they killed one of his daughters and he managed to get those prisoners which were
[02:51:13.240 --> 02:51:17.520]  of course responsible for the terrible lot of that fear Jesus so much I'll
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:21.120]  skin the latest breaking news on the pedophile rings we what why is it that
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:28.560]  name they run from because he is the image of somebody who has given us the
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:35.400]  key to fight that legion in his name just the mention of Jesus name fear includes
[02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:42.240]  fear in the enemy so that's it we have a great king who will come back and who
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:48.120]  will probably reign forever but of course now we have the remains of the
[02:51:48.120 --> 02:51:54.200]  satanic legion who are fighting off their this war against us and they are at
[02:51:54.200 --> 02:52:00.600]  this moment of time Alex definitely at a good point because they have taken over
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:07.440]  Silicon Valley they have taken over the left-wing politics they are basically
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:13.280]  fighting us at every level and and and we are a minority at the moment but I'm
[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:17.920]  sure that in the next few years people will come on our side just as they have
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:23.440]  abandoned CNN for info wars that is what's gonna happen well let's get in the
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:29.720]  latest in the pedophile rings Jeffrey Epstein this G Lynn Maxwell all this
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:34.840]  coming out what does this signify I mean I actually wanted to go to the in and
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:39.760]  out burger here in LA because that's where she has been seen lately I mean
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:44.600]  everybody's searching for her for a miss Maxwell the madam but apparently she's
[02:52:44.600 --> 02:52:51.600]  hanging out here in California Epstein himself of course has been murdered or
[02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:57.800]  suicided it's just the man even stupid to think that he could be really
[02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:03.200]  suicidal other people have of course said oh he has just been substituted at the
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:08.400]  last minute by somebody else and sent in Israel well to prove that they are wrong
[02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:14.840]  we should examine his infamous genitalia his egg-shaped genitalia which of
[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:23.040]  course came out in his deposition ten years ago and the fact that this genitalia
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:28.680]  was so particular was also demanded by the lawyers of all the victims who
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:33.640]  wanted to refer to the particularity of these things to demonstrate that they
[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:39.200]  had been a victim of this terrible molester this pedophile who had a whole
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:44.720]  ring around the world with the very full influential people like Prince Andrew
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:50.520]  I actually made a prank call on the 13th of August to Buckingham Palace one of
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:56.200]  the numbers listed on this black book of Epstein and it was indeed his private
[02:53:56.200 --> 02:54:03.200]  number the day after Prince Andrew who was supposed to be in Balmoral left an
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:08.320]  apparently Sarah Ferguson and Sarah Ferguson was here in not far from where
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:14.840]  I am in the Moabee County in Arizona just a week ago with Tony Robbins and what
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:20.120]  they were doing is actually something we should discuss because it regards an
[02:54:20.120 --> 02:54:25.400]  incredible data project the solar data project that they are putting there in
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:30.360]  the desert something that resembles a little bit that transcendence movie with
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:36.120]  Johnny Depp so Sarah Ferguson talked with the Queen the Queen told that
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:39.640]  basically bring away Prince Andrew because the situation is getting out
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:44.800]  control and apparently Queen Elizabeth is really angry with her son for having
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:49.880]  exposed the royal family to this kind of situation so they are they have been
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:55.800]  brought off to Malaga with a private jet both of them and now Prince Andrew is
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:01.880]  basically in hiding from even from his own mother who apparently is very angry
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:08.400]  with him and I can't imagine how how angry she is because of course the fact
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:14.560]  that this testimony of Epstein who apparently witnessed him having sex with
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:20.280]  a minor could throw the whole royal family in a crisis of unspeakable
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:27.120]  proportions how does that tie in how does that tie in to the cardinal he
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:31.000]  were we've been writing about the right-hand man the Pope of course
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:35.360]  Cardinal Pell we are waiting for his appeal on the 21st of August we know
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:39.920]  that the infamous Cardinal Pell was the number one two in the Vatican one of the
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:45.720]  most powerful ring leader for these pedophiles and Cardinal Pell is either
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:49.920]  will win this appeal and then will be sent off to one of the safety houses with
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:54.960]  a bunch of nuns severe than revered by them otherwise I think the cardinal
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.480]  Pell could be the next Epstein and he could be suicided because the moment
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:03.640]  in which exactly I was about to ask that will he be the next Epstein will
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:09.200]  Cardinal Pell be Epstein because now Arkansas Clinton side Clinton death but
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:15.880]  now it's now it's gonna be Epstein will Cardinal Pell be Epstein well if he
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:19.520]  doesn't win the appeal and the Pope is trying to actually force in the
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:24.000]  Australian authorities so he can win this appeal and finally end up his life
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:30.160]  in this big mansion in the meantime in Rome a mural appeared in next to the
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.800]  Vatican with the image of Satan grabbing from behind Cardinal Pell and
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:40.640]  everybody in Rome was shocked by this incredible mural that appeared in be a
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:45.320]  Gregorio Settimo so I am really interested in seeing what's gonna
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:52.080]  happen on 21st because Mark my words if he's not winning the appeal and so if
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:56.560]  he's not getting out of it he's definitely gonna be
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:01.280]  suicided wow this is an incredible time to be alive I remember reading your books
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:05.160]  15 years ago hearing you on air and thinking this is crazy everything you

[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:46.360]  on air infowarstore.com stay with us what you have witnessed is the
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:52.200]  biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history this is a
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:59.520]  digital AI enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones are in four wars
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:09.720]  calm this is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr.
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:15.880]  president we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:21.840]  info wars as a dominant independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign pro
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:26.760]  family populist organization so they thought first they come for Alex Jones
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:31.800]  then when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes
[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:35.880]  would fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever
[02:58:35.880 --> 02:58:40.080]  and make it a standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe
[02:58:40.080 --> 02:58:44.400]  they can take us down they'll take everybody else down
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:49.600]  Alex yes I got a plug for the Patriot points I get oh thank you got $180 so far
[02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:53.320]  this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you I buy so much in the store
[02:58:53.320 --> 02:58:55.560]  because I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart I don't want to give
[02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:58.480]  that money to people going to donate it to causes I don't believe in so I
[02:58:58.480 --> 02:59:01.400]  rather give that money to you and I'm getting quality products the products
[02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:05.760]  that I do receive have changed my life I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me
[02:59:05.760 --> 02:59:09.440]  I've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better and my kids they use the
[02:59:09.440 --> 02:59:13.400]  toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throat and he puts X2 in
[02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:16.880]  water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat let me break this down
[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:20.480]  for you I want high quality stuff in there I want a good price but I've kind
[02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:24.160]  of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off I'm
[02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:27.480]  making two dollars on the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same thing like the
[02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:31.040]  fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but
[02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:34.600]  listen when people get the Patriot points a lot of times it makes things a
[02:59:34.600 --> 02:59:37.720]  loss leader because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on
[02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:41.640]  auto-ship then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that we have
[02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:46.000]  Patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[02:59:46.000 --> 03:00:01.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you're listening to the antidote for fake
[03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:08.600]  news it's Alex Jones all right my cat I'm taking over next segment I'm just
[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:12.640]  being close right now we have the Google blacklist saying info wars is a
[03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:17.200]  number one enemy shut us down for major whistleblowers
[03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:23.920]  we had them on for an hour and a half we got my cat I'm taking over Leo Zagami
[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:28.600]  seer great author Leo Zagami.com Leo what would you call this period of
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:32.680]  history we're in you talk about the globalists have Hollywood they have the
[03:00:32.680 --> 03:00:37.080]  Democrats but they're they're losing on every front they've got all the money
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:40.920]  they stole but all that's just digital numbers I don't think things are going to
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:46.480]  well for them now they're not going too well for for anybody I mean even the
[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:50.760]  Vatican we have just talked about they're trying to reform their Vatican Bank
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:55.880]  because hiding what they have been doing in the few in the last few years
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:00.600]  it's becoming increasingly difficult even for them so they want to clear up
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:07.160]  their house but of course when it comes down to data and artificial
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:12.920]  intelligence that Pegasus group project which I talked about earlier with which
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:16.680]  saw the involvement of Sarah Ferguson and Tony Robbins should be something we
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:23.080]  should monitor like all the projects that regard the data because data mining
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:28.680]  and knowing everything about our lives it's very important for the enemy and
[03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:35.240]  of course we have been given this social network so we could empower the enemy
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:40.760]  with that information that's it's been like our failure but it's also been a
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:45.240]  possibility for us to transmit maybe information through the social media so
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:48.680]  we're bringing up Tommy Robinson what what Tommy Robinson you're talking about
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:54.560]  Tony Robinson Tony Robbins sorry Tony Robbins like the self-help guy yes yes
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:02:00.160]  yes Tony Robbins sorry the name I got confused I know he's been targeted
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:05.200]  recently by SJWs and stuff are you say what's involved in is involved in this
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:09.240]  new project which he presented a week ago with Sarah Ferguson the Duchess of
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:15.040]  York which we find also in the black book of Jeffrey Epstein and in this
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:20.160]  enormous new project which they are building close to Kingman Arizona a
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:29.720]  project which basically is built with solar panels that help data enormous
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:36.480]  data center built with solar panels unprecedented data center which is
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:41.360]  got heavily guarded apparently the whole facility is already guarded like it's
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:46.880]  some kind of area 51 so when I see the kind of security I always question what
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:50.960]  they're doing they don't you think so Alex sure sure I just like you I don't
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:54.520]  think of Tommy Robinson and I mean no Tommy Robinson is just interesting
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:59.120]  wildcard we'll we'll look into that all right Leo we got two minutes left any
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:02.320]  other points you want to make about what's happening the world right now yes
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:07.800]  I want to make an important point regarding of course the Italian political
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.720]  crisis that we are living in the last few days because after the visit of Nancy
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:18.480]  Pelosi in Italy apparently this visit has triggered an internal crisis that
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:25.400]  might break this government of populist forces and bring unfortunately once
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:32.120]  again the left-wing Democrats that are of course they're trying to break your
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:36.920]  border for a North African invasion yeah well of course we have also Richard
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:42.800]  Geer who went on a boat and he encouraged this massive immigration but he doesn't
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:46.280]  want anybody to go on his private jet I loved how the president said oh get on
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:51.560]  Richard Geer's private jet yes and we have just seen a photo of Richard Geer
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:57.800]  on a lavish yacht with his wife you know having a great time after this show that
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:02.760]  he did on the boat with the immigrants a boat with the immigrants that is now
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:10.160]  arriving on Italian soil because even Matteo Salvini is now arguing with the
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:13.440]  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte about it but I don't think it would be possible
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:19.880]  for him to stop this invasion because aside from the propaganda that of
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:25.760]  course he's doing as a politician to stop these immigrants then the facts talk
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:29.640]  a different language because well Richard Geer thought there are
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:35.440]  a bunch of gerbils on board that boat you know he thought there are a bunch of
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:38.560]  gerbils he was he heard like the boat and a bunch of gerbils he's like well I
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:42.360]  gotta get he's like let gerbils into Europe all right thank you
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:49.320]  Leah we're out of time it's an invasion of gerbils in this big giant tube right
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:55.240]  there the right best it was George Arwell said that in a time of universal
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:59.200]  deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used to it
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:02.560]  wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still loved our
[03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:05.920]  country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it but now
[03:05:05.920 --> 03:05:09.560]  they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down off of
[03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:12.760]  government buildings weird white leftist that one of virtually singular
[03:05:12.760 --> 03:05:17.320]  pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags this is the bizarreness
[03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:21.280]  of the America hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act in the time
[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:25.280]  of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:30.120]  particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on
[03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:35.360]  the back right there ladies and gentlemen America's back info wars.com so
[03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:39.480]  whatever you do take action today and exercise your free speech in these
[03:05:39.480 --> 03:05:43.520]  bullies face all over not just the US but worldwide because more than ever the
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:06:00.800]  American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism I've just joined us
[03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:05.320]  I don't normally engage in jokes but Richard gear I forgot to cover this the
[03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:09.640]  last week he went on a boat to North Africa and picked up a bunch of people
[03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:14.440]  to bring them into Europe he just said hey you all need to come in here and get
[03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:19.520]  free stuff now he doesn't say get on my plane come to LA live in my mansion
[03:06:19.520 --> 03:06:23.440]  there's photos of him out on this big yacht in the Mediterranean he's not
[03:06:23.440 --> 03:06:30.040]  bringing folks across on that no he wants you to bring people in immediately
[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:36.360]  because Richard gear was told that North Africa has the biggest gerbils you've
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:45.440]  ever seen and no seriously he thought he was rescuing shiploads of gerbils so
[03:06:45.440 --> 03:06:51.080]  this is an incredible moment right now Richard gear is attempting to give free
[03:06:51.080 --> 03:06:55.520]  access to gerbils to Europe so there's a full supply of gerbils he doesn't want
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:07:01.280]  to pay for the gerbils or the trebles that's a Star Trek analogy he doesn't
[03:07:01.280 --> 03:07:05.640]  want to pay for the trebles he wants you to pay for the trebles but when he wants
[03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:11.400]  access to a gerbil he's going to get it ladies and gentlemen or a nutria that's
[03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:18.000]  right he's moved on to nutria he's he's moved on to New York rats that are up to
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:24.720]  three pounds so Richard gear has married a gerbil ladies and gentlemen and he
[03:07:24.720 --> 03:07:31.520]  did he did it on board a boat in the Mediterranean so we're I mean just it's
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:36.080]  like JK Rawlings got mad at Paul Watson she's like open Europe to migrants tens
[03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:39.280]  of millions give them everything free throw old people out of their old
[03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:43.600]  people housing their section 8 give it to him and then Paul goes hey you own
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:47.840]  mansions all over Europe and Tasmania and everywhere take a few she goes oh
[03:07:47.840 --> 03:07:55.760]  he's a Nazi man him my god but JK Rowling I guess is the gerbil and the
[03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:59.920]  gateway to hell would be Richard gear but let's get serious my cannabis is
[03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:08.960]  about to take over right now that's of course Richard gerbil gear the king of
[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:13.640]  gerbils the master of gerbils word of masters the universe he's the masters
[03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:20.320]  of gerbils but before Mike Adams takes over remember that we're not here without
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:25.000]  you and that we have the biggest sale going since last Christmas we had to
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:29.240]  remove a few of the things as they sold out the World Awakens mega sale 56% off
[03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:34.400]  top-selling products and free shipping and of course a lot more info or stored
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:40.360]  calm and seriously we're in total war they're really pissed we still exist but
[03:08:40.360 --> 03:08:46.680]  thanks to you we are still here on air what about those two Google engineers
[03:08:46.680 --> 03:08:52.160]  for an hour and a half on air together exposing the total blueprint of lying to
[03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:57.080]  Congress and fixing the election and staging the algorithms and staging search
[03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:01.480]  results Mike you're an engineer you run natural news.com you're a successful guy
[03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:04.720]  hearing I don't know if you heard those guys but if you did or knew about it
[03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:08.920]  that's history that just happened what do you make of that it's truly
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:13.040]  extraordinary Alex I mean they laid out the actual blueprint for the
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:17.240]  algorithms that are designed to have a selective politically motivated
[03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:21.680]  censorship in order to steal not just this next election and they also stole
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.320]  the 2018 midterms but every election for the entire future of this country
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:32.480]  Google wants to control all information which means all knowledge all history
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:35.720]  and you've been saying that forever but now here are the documents where they
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:41.360]  want total information control and their minion Richard Gere codename Lemmy
[03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:47.440]  Wanks is for it you know this is making the case for criminal indictments in my
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:53.600]  view of Google executives there needs to be a criminal charges
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.600]  leveled against them because remember Robert Mueller filed charges against some
[03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:02.960]  Russian company for quote defrauding the United States of America simply for
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:08.080]  running ads on Facebook well if that's a crime Google has committed that crime a
[03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:15.800]  million times over so and also the CEO Pichai I think is his name lied before
[03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:20.720]  Congress I mean you you confronted him in Washington DC when he was lying to
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:26.360]  Congress smearing you and censoring your ability to defend yourself and tell
[03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:31.200]  your side of the story so it's it's it's over for Google if the law means
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:36.560]  anything they're lawless you just said it if if Congress isn't totally paralyzed
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:40.240]  and idiotic because even if they're not good guys why would they give their
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:44.440]  power up the US as global dominance we have the best idea why would they just
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:49.680]  hand it over it's satanic they they they literally want to shove America like
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:53.920]  Lemmy Wanks up Richard Gears ass I mean I'm sorry that's really you know it's
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:58.720]  the spiritual thing of that they want to dominate America for their own pleasure
[03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:03.280]  well yeah and of course they're pushing the LGBT indoctrination of children and
[03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:06.440]  all this cultural programming at the same time massive child abuse pedophilia
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:11.880]  everything imaginable this is consistent with Google's warped twisted dark
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:16.200]  satanic philosophy that now really determines their algorithms so it's not
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:20.480]  only us who are being censored Alex it's of course you know a pro Christian
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:25.120]  websites pro life websites like now they have the proof that there was a quote
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:30.360]  they call it a blacklist I mean this is smoking gun how big a smoking gun
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:36.360]  whistleblower is Zach Voorhees well these guys who have stepped forward they
[03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:41.040]  are heroes they are national heroes they have put their lives at risk you know you
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:45.280]  you saw how the Google called the FBI and the police to try to threaten and
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:48.240]  intimidate one of the engineers oh I'm already they've already tried to take
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:52.040]  my kids do I know what they've done to you it's not fun yeah no it's a it's
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:55.360]  unreal we're being threatened right now with another lawsuit by the way but it's
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:59.840]  it's I tell you what they they can't silence us as long as we have the
[03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:05.240]  determination to tell the truth and to fight as long as the audience supports
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:10.280]  naturalnews.com and infowars.com people need to get that we're barely making it
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:13.720]  right now I don't want to give the enemy any help but I mean it's all about the
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:17.120]  audience the audience gets that they're trying to suppress this and supports us
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:22.040]  nothing can stop human intelligence but if humid doesn't aid us Mike we're done
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:27.720]  well the the audience is that that watch us and listen to us they know what's at
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:32.440]  stake and that's why they voluntarily choose to support you and my work as
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:36.240]  well they they know that they're voting with their dollars and voting with their
[03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:41.080]  voices to support us because they know in a total war it's a total war in a total
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:44.880]  war look if we don't win this if Trump doesn't win if our republic doesn't
[03:12:44.880 --> 03:12:49.960]  win you people will find themselves waking up in a country where everything
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:53.600]  that you own and value will be destroyed every business will be seen that's
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:57.480]  their plan their plans to take all wealth away so they control you we're
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:02.760]  trying to create wealth folks that's the Christ energy we want wealth and they
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:07.360]  will they will kidnap your children if you don't submit to vaccinations you know
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:11.400]  they the state will become the medical tyrants I mean they already are in many
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:16.680]  places but understand that the economy will be if if the leftists are in charge
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:20.840]  it'll be a centralized economy where they will they will steal every private
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:25.040]  business they will steal private land they will criminalize they want to end
[03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:30.760]  competition because they are scum and it will all be sold in the name of
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:37.800]  equality when what it really is is equal suffering or equal torture by an
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:41.200]  authoritarian regime and that's why defeating these people is absolutely the
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:44.040]  number one it's got to be the top priority let me throw this in what your
[03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:48.120]  wife from Hong Kong or Taiwan I forget which one but I want Taiwan and this
[03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:53.240]  this we're already at war with China right now I know we we are very concerned
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:59.160]  about that and of course you know we've got contacts in Taiwan as well well who
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:02.920]  are in touch with what's happening in China there's a lot of concern that
[03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:07.920]  China's military assault on the Hong Kong protesters could set off an
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:12.800]  escalation of both geopolitical war and economic events let's just say it the
[03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:18.560]  Taiwanese and Hong Kong folks are gonna fight well yeah yeah look the Taiwan
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:23.320]  people I call Taiwan the Texas of Asia Taiwan people are used to being free
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:26.640]  they they they're wonderful entrepreneurs they're they're very
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:30.400]  intelligent they're dedicated to freedom they have free elections but that's not
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:35.080]  China you know and remember that it was my wife's family escaped the
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:41.480]  communists of mainland China escaped to Taiwan around 1950 my I'm again my wife
[03:14:41.480 --> 03:14:45.720]  is from people who escaped communist death camps so we know all about it and
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:50.160]  that's why we're fighting for freedom right now so much globally not just in
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:53.720]  America but also don't the communists know they take over Taiwan their food
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:14:57.200]  is gonna be poisoned there you get stabbed in their beds I mean that this
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:01.520]  is not Tiananmen Square well no no it isn't and of course the United States
[03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:06.880]  will respond with strategic force and and Japan may respond as well don't
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:12.200]  forget there's a very long history of China and Japan in in conflict and you
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:18.360]  know a lot of in insane violations point is is that the fuses lit absolutely
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:23.080]  and look the fuses lit everywhere what country can you think of that is stable
[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:29.240]  right now what what cultural situation is stable but you see I know you know
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:34.720]  this but speaking to your listeners the globalist want to ignite mass chaos they
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:38.760]  want a civil war in the United States they want collapse everywhere else
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:42.800]  because how do we counter that how do we stop it straight ahead with Mike Adams

[03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:55.160]  stop to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[03:17:55.160 --> 03:17:59.200]  hey yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a lot
[03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:02.560]  of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost
[03:18:02.560 --> 03:18:06.960]  nobody agrees with these war I think that the neocons are trying desperately to
[03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:10.720]  get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they
[03:18:10.720 --> 03:18:14.520]  could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:17.720]  I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:20.600]  way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to
[03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:23.400]  be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:26.840]  Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have
[03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:30.880]  arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love
[03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:33.920]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down
[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:38.880]  no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:42.480]  people like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep
[03:18:42.480 --> 03:18:45.960]  fighting in the input war and even if something does happen to you or your show
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:50.400]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:57.120]  you sir for calling Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:00.520]  our Republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close
[03:19:00.520 --> 03:19:04.400]  to the ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:08.080]  end up saving the nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned all US
[03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:13.480]  farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for
[03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:18.040]  the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:22.440]  our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't
[03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:26.880]  gonna back down so to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the
[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:30.600]  world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never gonna
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:34.600]  give up and all you've done is a wake up the human spirit the human spirit lives
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:40.040]  at info wars.com and news wars.com and I'm asking listeners whatever you do
[03:19:40.040 --> 03:19:43.960]  spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:48.840]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide

[03:20:10.240 --> 03:20:19.880]  with Mike Adams. Mike Adams joining you here for the fourth hour of the Alex
[03:20:19.880 --> 03:20:25.520]  Jones show today we're living in a whirlwind of chaos and deliberate
[03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:29.840]  attempted destruction and in this hour here I'm gonna bring you some
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:34.360]  additional news that maybe you haven't heard about new efforts by Bill Gates to
[03:20:34.360 --> 03:20:39.200]  pollute the atmosphere with a new experimental program that releases lead
[03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:44.720]  contaminated dust into the atmosphere I'm gonna cover that but first before I
[03:20:44.720 --> 03:20:48.800]  get to that and some other stories my goodness you know the Dayton shooter was
[03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:53.280]  on anti-depressants right so Xanax was found in his blood I'm gonna get to that
[03:20:53.280 --> 03:21:00.160]  as well before I get to that I want to ask for your prayers of safety for all
[03:21:00.160 --> 03:21:05.600]  the Patriots in Portland who are it looks like they're gonna be subjected to
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:10.760]  some kind of a massive maybe a false flag attack or violence it's you know
[03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:14.880]  already in Portland some of the Patriots are being subjected to unfair
[03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:21.260]  arrests and accusations it's it happened already today you know things are
[03:21:21.260 --> 03:21:25.920]  heating up there for the the rally Joe Biggs is on site and and many other
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:29.720]  people I don't know whose names it's okay for me to release so I'm not gonna
[03:21:29.720 --> 03:21:33.880]  mention any names but there are a lot of people on site and they need your prayers
[03:21:33.880 --> 03:21:39.080]  for protection understand that conservatives and Patriots never
[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:43.840]  initiate violence and we never call for initiating violence but we do assert
[03:21:43.840 --> 03:21:48.320]  the right to self-defense and so if Patriots are attacked in Portland don't
[03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:52.680]  be surprised if someone asserts their right to defend themselves against a
[03:21:52.680 --> 03:21:58.720]  violent potentially fatal assault by some lunatic left-wing antifa terrorist I
[03:21:58.720 --> 03:22:03.760]  hope we don't see that happen I hope it's peaceful but we also know that the
[03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:08.120]  Portland police have been ordered to stand down before we know that the mayor
[03:22:08.120 --> 03:22:12.640]  of Portland appears to be an antifa terrorist sympathizer so the situation
[03:22:12.640 --> 03:22:19.200]  could be quite dire so pray for everyone's safety there I mean heck even
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:23.920]  even pray for the safety of of the antifa people if you want let's just have
[03:22:23.920 --> 03:22:28.840]  no bloodshed okay let's have no violence there let's just just let the
[03:22:28.840 --> 03:22:33.720]  Patriots have their First Amendment right to speak that's absolutely crucial
[03:22:33.720 --> 03:22:39.480]  another thing last week when I was on the show I mentioned I was gonna post a
[03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:47.320]  video showing exactly where to dremel off an 80% lower receiver to prepare it
[03:22:47.320 --> 03:22:54.760]  for use in a ghost gun or machine so this is how you can make you know an AR-15
[03:22:54.760 --> 03:22:59.360]  legally always follow your local laws of course but you can you can make this
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:04.920]  you have to use a dremel tool and dremel off anodized receivers to have six
[03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:11.760]  contact points where the ghost gunner can have that conductance contact points
[03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:15.960]  basically so I posted that video they're showing it now if you're watching it's
[03:23:15.960 --> 03:23:20.000]  up on Brighton.com I have not found anybody else anywhere on the internet
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:24.240]  who posted this video so I made the video for you so that you can buy anodized
[03:23:24.240 --> 03:23:29.640]  80% lowers and you can drill them out with the ghost gunner and you can legally
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:35.200]  make your own firearms for self-defense now just as a note again follow local
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:39.440]  laws so if this is illegal for you to do I think that machine is banned in New
[03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:43.800]  Jersey then obviously don't use it in New Jersey I want you to always follow
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:49.040]  local laws I do I don't advocate violating the laws but I also want to
[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:54.680]  encourage you to exercise your rights under law and you have a right under
[03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:58.800]  the Constitution and under current federal law to manufacture your own
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:03.320]  firearm for your own personal use as long as you don't transfer to someone
[03:24:03.320 --> 03:24:07.600]  else you know don't turn yourself into a gun dealer that's illegal you know you
[03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:12.840]  need an FFL to do that you have to apply with ATF and all that don't definitely
[03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:19.240]  make an effort to make your own firearms because look if Joe Biden becomes
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:23.520]  president which probably won't happen but if he did he's already promised to
[03:24:23.520 --> 03:24:28.640]  essentially go door-to-door confiscating all your guns and red flag laws in
[03:24:28.640 --> 03:24:32.680]  order for them to be enforced they have to have a national gun registry so they
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:36.680]  are going to try to identify every person that owns a firearm even firearms
[03:24:36.680 --> 03:24:40.080]  that you've already purchased before and they're going to try to come to your
[03:24:40.080 --> 03:24:46.120]  door and take those firearms and that is an illegal tyrannical act that Joe
[03:24:46.120 --> 03:24:49.920]  Biden would theoretically attempt to carry out and I think that we have a
[03:24:49.920 --> 03:24:54.360]  duty to defend our rights I don't know about you but I mean I love America I
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:59.760]  I love Texas and I'm gonna defend this republic against ballless tyrants who
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:03.280]  are violating the Constitution and so guess what the Founding Fathers gave
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:06.720]  you some tools to get that accomplished and one tool is called the Second
[03:25:06.720 --> 03:25:10.560]  Amendment the others called the First Amendment both are under assault but you
[03:25:10.560 --> 03:25:16.640]  should exercise both amendments to the fullest extent that is allowed under the
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:22.640]  law again keep it legal never initiate violence but always be willing to defend
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:30.240]  yourself now let's go to the Dayton mass shooter Connor Betts I think was his
[03:25:30.240 --> 03:25:35.080]  name now being reported by Cincinnati comm perhaps you've seen this news it
[03:25:35.080 --> 03:25:41.480]  broke earlier that his blood contained Xanax so another antidepressant drug
[03:25:41.480 --> 03:25:46.560]  linked to another mass shooter how many times have we seen mass shooters on
[03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:50.920]  antidepressant drugs seems like it's about I mean this is just a general
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:56.440]  estimate maybe it's 80 to 90 percent of mass shooters are on this class of drugs
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:26:00.720]  and he had other substances in his bloodstream as well so maybe there was
[03:26:00.720 --> 03:26:06.200]  some combination effects kicking in but you know these antidepressants these
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:11.440]  allow some people because of their genetic predisposition to being unable
[03:26:11.440 --> 03:26:15.000]  to clear these drugs from their system some people then become dissociated
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:19.360]  from reality and in some cases they feel like they're carrying out like a first
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:23.640]  person shooter video game and I'm not saying that video games cause this
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:28.440]  person to become a mass shooter I'm saying that perhaps the SSRI drugs did
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:34.200]  the mind-altering psychiatric drugs are linked to so many shootings sometimes
[03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:37.800]  the shooter doesn't realize they're in the real world they think they're in a
[03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:43.120]  dream or or an artificial construct like a video game and so they don't think
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:48.520]  that there's actually real consequences to them opening fire on someone and then
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:54.120]  I think in some cases they're shocked when they're actually shot or arrested
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:59.280]  because maybe they snap out of that you know hallucination that psychiatric
[03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:03.000]  cloud and then they realize oh my god this was real they just shot somebody
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:07.760]  for real didn't this guy shoot his own sister I think he did why would you
[03:27:07.760 --> 03:27:10.080]  shoot your own sister I don't I don't understand maybe maybe there's some
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:12.960]  personal conflict going on there but look there's something else about that
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:19.000]  shooting that is very important to recognize according to Cincinnati.com
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:24.040]  two of the victims who were killed were actually shot by police on accident
[03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:30.000]  by accident the police of course did a great job of responding very rapidly to
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:33.600]  this shooter who was a radical left-wing liberal you know Elizabeth Warren
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:38.960]  supporter all that stuff Bernie Sanders supporter not that it's not the fault of
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:42.400]  Bernie Sanders I'm not saying that but this guy was a radical leftist so police
[03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:46.400]  responded very quickly which is admirable and they opened fire on this
[03:27:46.400 --> 03:27:49.480]  guy and they shot him I think dozens of times I don't have the exact number but
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:56.280]  they opened fire on the guy sadly they they hit two innocent bystanders which
[03:27:56.280 --> 03:28:03.800]  tells you a couple of things number one you know bullet control even cops I've
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:07.680]  talked about this before even when they have good intentions police officers
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:12.400]  who I've trained with in over the years and in many scenarios police officers
[03:28:12.400 --> 03:28:17.680]  especially new ones are among the least well-trained shooters you know your
[03:28:17.680 --> 03:28:22.560]  average US Marine is way better trained in fact well-trained as a shooter as a
[03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:27.520]  rifleman compared to your average police officer police officers very frequently
[03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:32.920]  accidentally rained down fire upon innocent bystanders and we need to have
[03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:36.680]  a discussion about this I think we need more training for cops frankly who
[03:28:36.680 --> 03:28:40.160]  respond to these situations anyway we're gonna go to a break I'll be back with
[03:28:40.160 --> 03:28:44.680]  more about Bill Gates and his chemtrails and maybe more thoughts about the
[03:28:44.680 --> 03:28:49.480]  shooting in Dayton this is the Alex Jones show be right back

[03:30:56.040 --> 03:30:59.760]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that
[03:30:59.760 --> 03:31:03.600]  were close to the ground close to reality who actually worked for a living
[03:31:03.600 --> 03:31:07.040]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist Chinese have banned
[03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:12.240]  all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls
[03:31:12.240 --> 03:31:17.080]  support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put
[03:31:17.080 --> 03:31:21.800]  pressure on our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we
[03:31:21.800 --> 03:31:26.400]  aren't gonna back down so to the Joaquin cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the
[03:31:26.400 --> 03:31:30.120]  world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never gonna
[03:31:30.120 --> 03:31:34.120]  give up and all you've done is a wake of the human spirit the human spirit lives
[03:31:34.120 --> 03:31:39.560]  at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com and I'm asking listeners whatever you do
[03:31:39.560 --> 03:31:43.480]  spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[03:31:43.480 --> 03:31:48.280]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[03:31:50.920 --> 03:31:56.280]  the globalist are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are
[03:31:56.280 --> 03:32:00.080]  technocrats they are control freaks in their own words and they believe a
[03:32:00.080 --> 03:32:03.280]  allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions it's in the way
[03:32:03.280 --> 03:32:07.680]  of their great destiny to merge with AI gods now we're fighting them hard in
[03:32:07.680 --> 03:32:11.240]  cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but
[03:32:11.240 --> 03:32:14.880]  one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a
[03:32:14.880 --> 03:32:18.960]  lot of control in our lives is our bodies if I wasn't taking the highest
[03:32:18.960 --> 03:32:23.120]  quality supplements from the ForrestLive.com I couldn't do it that's why
[03:32:23.120 --> 03:32:27.320]  we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[03:32:27.320 --> 03:32:34.040]  metacobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra 12 ultra 12 is
[03:32:34.040 --> 03:32:37.800]  undoubtedly the strongest highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[03:32:37.800 --> 03:32:42.240]  going to find anywhere it is amazing experience pure metacobalamin B12 for
[03:32:42.240 --> 03:32:46.240]  yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at
[03:32:46.240 --> 03:32:53.520]  infowarstore.com, infowarstlife.com or triple A 253-3139
[03:32:53.520 --> 03:33:00.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:33:10.560 --> 03:33:20.600]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams
[03:33:20.600 --> 03:33:25.000]  all right we're going to get into Bill Gates newest mad science experiment
[03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:29.480]  here you're going to be blown away I mean you know you know Bill Gates he has
[03:33:29.480 --> 03:33:32.800]  funded well through through his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other
[03:33:32.800 --> 03:33:37.360]  things he's funded a lot of rather bizarre depopulation technologies for
[03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:44.040]  example years ago he funded an ultrasonic scrotum blaster technology I'm
[03:33:44.040 --> 03:33:47.280]  not even making that up I mean he didn't call it that but it's an ultrasonic
[03:33:47.280 --> 03:33:53.840]  birth control device for men and what they do sorry to be graphic but they
[03:33:53.840 --> 03:33:58.920]  kind of clamp your scrotum in a giant ultrasonic machine and it emits such a
[03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:03.680]  high-energy frequency that it destroys your testee's ability to even produce
[03:34:03.680 --> 03:34:08.720]  sperm for about six months can you imagine that I mean can you imagine if
[03:34:08.720 --> 03:34:12.600]  he combines that with you know red flag laws or something like oh if you're
[03:34:12.600 --> 03:34:16.360]  conservative you have to go into the the scrotum blaster machine or something you
[03:34:16.360 --> 03:34:20.720]  know that's that's kind of the dream of leftist it's it's insane the kind of
[03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:25.160]  stuff they come up with well now oh and by the way notice that Bill Gates is
[03:34:25.160 --> 03:34:30.560]  targeting men you know because men are bad of course but but now here's here's
[03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:34.440]  his newest one in conjunction with Harvard scientists they've come up with a
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:39.440]  new project to pollute the entire planet it's called scopex and it means
[03:34:39.440 --> 03:34:49.040]  stratospheric controlled perturbation experiment scopex scop ex scopex now in
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:54.800]  this experiment they take calcium carbonate and they release it into the
[03:34:54.800 --> 03:35:00.000]  atmosphere to block the Sun and this is supposed to stop global warming by
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:06.080]  blocking the Sun basically it's mimicking a massive volcanic eruption now
[03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:09.720]  I don't know if you've read anything about the history of volcanoes but there
[03:35:09.720 --> 03:35:14.280]  was a volcanic eruption I think it was in the late 1700s or maybe the early
[03:35:14.280 --> 03:35:20.960]  1800s that caused so much dust to enter the atmosphere that it was it caused
[03:35:20.960 --> 03:35:26.880]  food crop failures for two years okay it was it I think it was even recorded as
[03:35:26.880 --> 03:35:31.200]  like the summer without a Sun because if you put all this ash into the atmosphere
[03:35:31.200 --> 03:35:36.120]  you kill the food crops and you cause famines you cause the collapse of
[03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:41.360]  civilization this is what Bill Gates is working on now again it's called scopex
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:45.320]  now here's something else very interesting that you can only get right
[03:35:45.320 --> 03:35:49.360]  here from the independent media turns out and you know I run a heavy metals
[03:35:49.360 --> 03:35:54.480]  laboratory I do a lot of research there I release results all the time but we've
[03:35:54.480 --> 03:35:59.920]  actually tested dozens of calcium carbonate products you know calcium
[03:35:59.920 --> 03:36:04.760]  supplements in bulk form powder form capsule form and so on turns out that
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:12.000]  calcium is a natural attractor of lead a toxic heavy metal that causes lowered
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:15.720]  IQs by the way causes brain damage and reproductive damage and cancer all kinds
[03:36:15.720 --> 03:36:22.200]  of things we have found I think on average between two and about eight parts
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:25.560]  per million of lead in all the calcium carbonate we've ever tested sort of
[03:36:25.560 --> 03:36:30.320]  cheap low-grade a mind out of the ground you know calcium carbonate minerals
[03:36:30.320 --> 03:36:35.360]  this means that this Bill Gates project would be emitting not just calcium
[03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:41.280]  carbonate into the air but lead so he would be polluting the skies with lead
[03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:45.480]  chemtrails so it's not just the aluminum and the barium and everything else that
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:52.120]  you probably already familiar with we are talking lead calcium chemtrail now
[03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:57.520]  what would the effects be of this well number one of course you're gonna have
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:00.760]  lead falling on all the croplands everywhere around the world because it's
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:03.960]  gonna eventually drop out of the sky so you're going to have a lead
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:08.920]  contamination of the entire global food supply and remember one of the big side
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:14.760]  effects of lead ingestion is lowered IQs so this is not only a way to dim the
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:19.720]  sun it's a way to dumb down the population through global lead poisoning
[03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:24.080]  that simply cannot be avoided unless you grow food in a greenhouse which is
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:30.280]  extraordinarily expensive this would drop lead on the rivers the oceans lakes and
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:34.840]  ponds so there would be enhanced lead contamination of all the fish and seafood
[03:37:34.840 --> 03:37:38.400]  that you eat as well this is a Bill Gates special right here he's got it all
[03:37:38.400 --> 03:37:43.160]  figured out at the same time the calcium carbonate falling out of the sky would
[03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:50.600]  alter the alkalinity of the soils that it falls on so now we're raising the pH
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:57.640]  of soils which would deprive nutrients to plant roots because plants need some
[03:37:57.640 --> 03:38:01.680]  acidity in order to be able to assimilate nutrients if you start messing with the
[03:38:01.680 --> 03:38:08.520]  pH of soils by raising the pH what you do is you cause plants to absorb fewer
[03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:13.360]  nutrients and minerals you cause many plants to be unable to produce as much
[03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:17.520]  food or as much medicine if they're herbal plants and so on basically you're
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:23.080]  killing off the plant-based ecosystem of the planet and at the same time as that
[03:38:23.080 --> 03:38:27.960]  pay attention this is this is astonishing you're dimming the sun so
[03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:32.640]  you're shutting off photosynthesis or shutting it down photosynthesis is what
[03:38:32.640 --> 03:38:37.320]  plants use to generate energy without photosynthesis you have no food crops
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:44.720]  you have no food web every animal on the planet which includes you and I would
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:50.640]  die if Bill Gates's plan is rolled out and that's his plan remember Bill Gates
[03:38:50.640 --> 03:38:55.000]  is the king of depopulation he wants to go down in history I think as the king
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:59.120]  of genocide he wants to kill a thousand times more people than Adolf Hitler ever
[03:38:59.120 --> 03:39:03.880]  imagined killing you know he wants to kill six billion people not not six
[03:39:03.880 --> 03:39:08.280]  million but six billion this is how he's gonna do it and you can't escape it
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:11.880]  because of course you're breathing the same air everybody's sharing the same
[03:39:11.880 --> 03:39:16.360]  atmosphere if it's falling out of the sky all over the planet it's gonna fall
[03:39:16.360 --> 03:39:21.200]  on your lawn your food crops your garden your local farm it's gonna fall on
[03:39:21.200 --> 03:39:25.960]  grass that's eaten by cows that are dairy cows so it's gonna be in the milk
[03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:29.680]  that you buy at the grocery store if you're drinking milk it's gonna be in
[03:39:29.680 --> 03:39:33.920]  everything this is the Bill Gates plan this is the annihilation of humanity
[03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:39.240]  again shut down photosynthesis by dimming the sun alter the alkalinity of
[03:39:39.240 --> 03:39:45.120]  the soils to reduce nutrient uptake by plants add lead to everything to lower
[03:39:45.120 --> 03:39:49.360]  IQs and dumb down human population while you're also collapsing the global
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:54.760]  food supply and I'm trying to say this with kind of a calm scientific voice I
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:59.080]  probably should be screaming at the top of my lungs here because this is this is
[03:39:59.080 --> 03:40:03.280]  the suicide plan for humanity it's part of it there are actually multiple layers
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:08.600]  to this plan but I'm trying to present this to you in the most calm collected
[03:40:08.600 --> 03:40:14.280]  way possible so that you understand the facts here the fact is that photosynthesis
[03:40:14.280 --> 03:40:19.760]  is the basis of all human civilization all life because humans need food and
[03:40:19.760 --> 03:40:22.280]  you can't grow food without photosynthesis and you don't have
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:27.760]  photosynthesis without sunlight and carbon dioxide what is the radical left
[03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:32.720]  at war with they're at war with the Sun they think the Sun is bad and they want
[03:40:32.720 --> 03:40:36.720]  to dim the Sun they're also at war with carbon dioxide they say it's bad right
[03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:41.160]  and they say they have to get rid of it because well they say carbon is a
[03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:44.320]  pollutant well guess what you're made of carbon we're all made of carbon and
[03:40:44.320 --> 03:40:49.600]  plants use carbon for this purpose so understand I'm really trying to drive
[03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:55.720]  this home with you that number one chemtrails are real the chemtrails are
[03:40:55.720 --> 03:41:02.040]  going to be altered to now release lead a toxic heavy metal along with cows in
[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:06.280]  carbonate this is being run by Harvard scientists it's already funded by Bill
[03:41:06.280 --> 03:41:10.200]  Gates again the name of this is stratospheric controlled perturbation
[03:41:10.200 --> 03:41:16.720]  experiment scope x they're going to be doing a pilot study right away with a
[03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:21.520]  few million dollars worth of flights you know airplanes loaded with this this
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:25.080]  toxic dust that they're going to release and if that's successful if they get
[03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:29.200]  enough money to do this and that money will come from you know George Soros and
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:32.160]  Bill Gates and who knows who else they're going to do this to the entire
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:36.920]  planet so people everywhere people in third-world countries who can barely get
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:40.640]  by because they can't grow enough food to feed themselves they're going to starve
[03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:44.520]  to death and die and that's part of the plan that is part of the plan of the
[03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:47.880]  globalist but it's not going to end with the third world starvation and mass
[03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:53.040]  death it's going to also include you in the United States or wherever you're
[03:41:53.040 --> 03:42:00.160]  watching this you have been slated for termination you have been deemed a
[03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:05.160]  useless eater by the globalist they want to eliminate you and they have a means
[03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:08.440]  to do it and they're running the experiments right now and then they're
[03:42:08.440 --> 03:42:11.960]  saying you're crazy if you believe in chemtrails while they're running chemtrails
[03:42:11.960 --> 03:42:16.840]  experiments to kill all life as we know it on this planet think about that that's
[03:42:16.840 --> 03:42:21.400]  how insane reality has become so when Alex says we're at war with these
[03:42:21.400 --> 03:42:26.240]  globalists understand the globalists are at war with humanity they literally want
[03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:32.680]  you dead en masse they want billions of us to be dead and they are rolling out a
[03:42:32.680 --> 03:42:36.040]  program to accomplish that and they're going to survive in their underground
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:40.120]  caves for a period of time and then they think re-emerge back onto the planet
[03:42:40.120 --> 03:42:44.800]  if everybody else gone that's their plan much more straight ahead step with us
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:53.680]  here Alex Jones show we'll be right back one half of the incredible eight pack
[03:42:53.680 --> 03:42:57.800]  power stack the am wake up and work packet is exactly what you need to start

[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:54.080]  miss info war's life product I talk about this on the air and I know it
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:57.280]  sinks into people but I've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our
[03:43:57.280 --> 03:44:00.640]  supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship
[03:44:00.640 --> 03:44:03.880]  and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it I would talk about how great the
[03:44:03.880 --> 03:44:07.080]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and I have doctors on
[03:44:07.080 --> 03:44:10.200]  experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years I'm
[03:44:10.200 --> 03:44:13.400]  like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing
[03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:15.600]  people like to buy a supplements because they know how great they are and how
[03:44:15.600 --> 03:44:18.240]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere
[03:44:18.240 --> 03:44:23.160]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under
[03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:28.000]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:31.400]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then they say you've
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:35.160]  got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[03:44:35.160 --> 03:44:38.040]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:41.120]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[03:44:41.120 --> 03:44:45.360]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info or
[03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:53.520]  store com or triple eight two five three three one three nine Thomas Jefferson
[03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:58.560]  predicted over 240 years ago that when our Republic was in trouble in the
[03:44:58.560 --> 03:45:02.280]  future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[03:45:02.280 --> 03:45:06.000]  who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:11.120]  the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen
[03:45:11.120 --> 03:45:15.320]  massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in
[03:45:15.320 --> 03:45:19.760]  this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful
[03:45:19.760 --> 03:45:24.320]  Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't gonna back down so to the
[03:45:24.320 --> 03:45:27.760]  walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate
[03:45:27.760 --> 03:45:31.880]  people and tell us to back down we're never gonna give up and all you've done

[03:47:18.640 --> 03:47:25.520]  mike adams very clear from the google whistleblowers who went public that
[03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:29.640]  google is now engaged in espionage against the united states of america
[03:47:29.640 --> 03:47:36.120]  but google has become an enemy combatant in a war to destroy america this
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:40.640]  realization is just now hitting home to people all across america and even
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:43.840]  across the trump administration i'm going to get to some more details about
[03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:48.720]  that but first let me just underscore the importance of your financial support
[03:47:48.720 --> 03:47:53.960]  support for info wars store you know alex never asked me to plug anything i'm
[03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:59.240]  just here to say this network it's crucial that this network survive and i
[03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:03.040]  know you're supporting info wars store.com i want you to know i support
[03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:08.680]  info wars store as well the products are really outstanding very smartly
[03:48:08.680 --> 03:48:13.480]  formulated and very clean we've tested many of them in our laboratory as well
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:16.880]  and i just got to say you know you have a choice of where you spend your money
[03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:23.240]  why not invest it in this network that's fighting for your survival as a free

[03:48:29.160 --> 03:48:33.600]  moment you know and the deals the sales that that are at info wars store.com
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:38.120]  are really quite extraordinary so be sure to check that out now getting back
[03:48:38.120 --> 03:48:44.280]  to google you know google is working for china okay so google is developing not
[03:48:44.280 --> 03:48:50.280]  only orwellian surveillance systems to keep tabs on the citizens of china
[03:48:50.280 --> 03:48:54.040]  they're really using china as a pilot program to roll out those exact same
[03:48:54.040 --> 03:49:00.000]  systems across the united states remember google is also working on ai so
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:05.040]  artificial intelligence is the ultimate weapon system to enslave and control
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:11.400]  humanity and google is sharing key ai technology with china according to some
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:15.400]  whistleblowers who have already spoken out and some critics like peter teal who
[03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:22.040]  has spoken out about this as well this is you know in world war two a strategic
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:28.200]  resource was rubber and oil okay you couldn't fight a war a kinetic war back
[03:49:28.200 --> 03:49:34.080]  in the 1940s without rubber and oil where the wars of the future are going to be
[03:49:34.080 --> 03:49:40.200]  fought with AI AI weapons systems AI technologies cyber war so whoever controls
[03:49:40.200 --> 03:49:46.240]  AI will control the world why is google developing AI and handing it to china a
[03:49:46.240 --> 03:49:53.080]  communist nation a bully nation that despises freedom a nation that arrests
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:57.400]  peaceful phallon gong members and has their organs harvested to sell them on
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:01.840]  the black market why is google supporting an organ harvesting evil
[03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:06.200]  communist regime that's the enemy of freedom the enemy of humanity and the
[03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:11.000]  enemy of the united states the answer should be simple because google agrees
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:17.120]  with all those philosophies google is a treasonous murderous criminal
[03:50:17.120 --> 03:50:21.320]  enterprise in my opinion and google has to be stopped because look they're
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:26.800]  working on drone technology terminator systems basically but flying terminators
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:33.480]  okay flying terminators combined with their location recognition systems if
[03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:37.160]  you're walking around with a google phone and android phone you have a
[03:50:37.160 --> 03:50:41.600]  location tracker on your back and once google wants you dead not just
[03:50:41.600 --> 03:50:47.240]  silenced but actually dead all they have to do is dispatch a suicide drone to
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:51.200]  explode near your phone assuming that you will be near your phone because you're
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:55.800]  probably carrying it walking down the street so we're talking about an army
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:51:02.280]  of google terminator flying you know hunter killer drones which were sort of
[03:51:02.280 --> 03:51:06.560]  depicted back in the original terminator movie from the 1980s but these
[03:51:06.560 --> 03:51:10.080]  terminator drones will be much smaller just large enough to hold an explosive
[03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:14.320]  charge google is already more powerful than any nation they're more dangerous
[03:51:14.320 --> 03:51:19.040]  than any nation google is more dangerous than North Korea North Korea has
[03:51:19.040 --> 03:51:24.280]  nukes but North Korea doesn't control our history our science our medicine our
[03:51:24.280 --> 03:51:29.640]  consciousness and our elections google controls all that by twisting and
[03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:33.560]  warping the information systems that it controls and google is working on
[03:51:33.560 --> 03:51:37.880]  terminator robots and they and they do want to kill people who are their
[03:51:37.880 --> 03:51:45.560]  political enemies and google is run by cry bully snowflake libtard leftists who
[03:51:45.560 --> 03:51:49.760]  feel that they are attacked by opinions that differ with their worldview
[03:51:49.760 --> 03:51:54.200]  libtard leftists who think that they have the right to murder anyone with
[03:51:54.200 --> 03:51:58.400]  whom they disagree this is what was openly talked about in the Berkeley
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:02.360]  student newspaper and student editorials calling for the killing of
[03:52:02.360 --> 03:52:06.520]  potential guests like Ann Coulter for example
[03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:13.280]  she she would suggest things that they don't want to hear so we're talking
[03:52:13.280 --> 03:52:17.680]  about leftists that respect no life obviously they murder their own children
[03:52:17.680 --> 03:52:21.480]  right they they want to kill their own babies the most offensive thing to a
[03:52:21.480 --> 03:52:27.200]  leftist is not Donald Trump but an infant born alive yeah they want to cut off
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:30.000]  the head of Trump but they want to cut off the genitals of their own babies and
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:34.240]  transform them them into transgenders that's how sick these people are these
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:38.360]  are the people running Google and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and
[03:52:38.360 --> 03:52:43.480]  Snapchat and Instagram all of them they're all anti-human pro-communist
[03:52:43.480 --> 03:52:49.040]  pro-china treasonous actors enemies of the people enemies of life enemies of
[03:52:49.040 --> 03:52:54.240]  babies that's who they are and that's why they must be defeated now in defeating
[03:52:54.240 --> 03:52:59.400]  them there's some potential good news of course we never advocate any kind of
[03:52:59.400 --> 03:53:03.640]  violence against these entities that's not the way we choose to solve problems
[03:53:03.640 --> 03:53:09.160]  Trump is gonna put out an executive order that could be just key to this he's
[03:53:09.160 --> 03:53:13.680]  going to order apparently the FCC and the FTC to go after these companies in
[03:53:13.680 --> 03:53:20.000]  various ways that could be effective but I think Trump needs to arrest some of
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:25.040]  these CEOs for treason for sharing secrets with our enemies the communist
[03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:29.520]  Chinese and the violation of the human rights of all the American people who
[03:53:29.520 --> 03:53:34.720]  use their services in fact I think now this is just my opinion I think Trump
[03:53:34.720 --> 03:53:39.840]  needs to seize the domain names of Google.com and Facebook.com and Twitter.com
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:45.280]  YouTube.com sees them temporarily not for the government to run them but just so
[03:53:45.280 --> 03:53:49.600]  that you force those people to come to the table and negotiate so that they
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:54.520]  will respect human rights freedom of speech and stop being enemies of America
[03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:59.680]  give them back their domain names once they sign consent decrees that protects
[03:53:59.680 --> 03:54:03.240]  the First Amendment and and national security of course other things like
[03:54:03.240 --> 03:54:10.720]  that why not I mean Obama would do it Obama would would do anything to
[03:54:10.720 --> 03:54:15.080]  promote his cause which is evil and twisted why can't Trump use the power
[03:54:15.080 --> 03:54:19.600]  of government to promote national security and human rights just
[03:54:19.600 --> 03:54:23.160]  temporarily I'm not saying the government should run these companies just
[03:54:23.160 --> 03:54:26.880]  that we should force them to respect basic human liberties the individual
[03:54:26.880 --> 03:54:30.840]  liberties that are described in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
[03:54:30.840 --> 03:54:34.960]  it's time for Trump to get tough with these tech giants so he needs your
[03:54:34.960 --> 03:54:40.680]  support I'm asking you to call your senators especially those of you in
[03:54:40.680 --> 03:54:43.520]  Missouri you have a great senator Josh Hawley there who has really been
[03:54:43.520 --> 03:54:47.320]  spearheading a lot of this but call your senators even Senator Ted Cruz of
[03:54:47.320 --> 03:54:51.360]  Texas has spoken out on this as well he's been really good on this issue call
[03:54:51.360 --> 03:54:56.240]  your senators and tell them that you demand freedom of speech be respected
[03:54:56.240 --> 03:54:59.960]  by the tech giants and if they don't respect freedom of speech and they need
[03:54:59.960 --> 03:55:03.720]  to be shut down or they need to be regulated out of existence because they
[03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:09.160]  do not abide by the rules of civil society why should Google even be allowed
[03:55:09.160 --> 03:55:14.640]  to operate in America if they won't allow people to speak right I mean it's
[03:55:14.640 --> 03:55:19.880]  it's so outrageous it's anti-American it's anti-human rights and Google is
[03:55:19.880 --> 03:55:23.480]  working for the enemies of America they're working for the Communist
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:28.200]  Chinese and now that the algorithms have come out and all the blacklist files
[03:55:28.200 --> 03:55:32.760]  thanks to those whistleblowers who went public in via project Veritas and Sarah
[03:55:32.760 --> 03:55:37.160]  Carter cover this as well and of course here on infowars had a lot of coverage
[03:55:37.160 --> 03:55:42.440]  thanks to those American heroes we now know the truth Google has done this
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:47.120]  deliberately Google lied to Congress Google has been deliberately blacklisting
[03:55:47.120 --> 03:55:52.280]  the most important independent media voices the real press in America we are
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:57.360]  the free press we are the voices that actually matter not the not the puppets
[03:55:57.360 --> 03:56:01.160]  on CNN who are given a script of what to say every day and their voice is
[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:05.880]  exactly the same as the voices on MSNBC and CBS and everywhere else they're all
[03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:10.520]  the same they're all reading scripts no one's reading a script here I mean I've
[03:56:10.520 --> 03:56:13.480]  got a I've got a page of a couple of notes a couple of bullet points here
[03:56:13.480 --> 03:56:17.680]  there's no teleprompter here there's never a teleprompter on infowars nobody's
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:22.680]  reading a script we give it a T straight telling it like it is and that's why
[03:56:22.680 --> 03:56:26.600]  they want to silence our voices but keep in mind that everything is at stake
[03:56:26.600 --> 03:56:30.040]  right now everything and these tech giants must be defeated they must be
[03:56:30.040 --> 03:56:36.040]  dismantled by the Trump administration or maybe by some other legal means this
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:39.800]  is crucial for the survival of human civilization it's essential for the
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:43.880]  survival of the United States of America if you want your children and
[03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:48.160]  grandchildren to have anything resembling freedom and liberty then Google must be
[03:56:48.160 --> 03:56:53.320]  defeated and the CEOs and managers of these companies must be arrested they
[03:56:53.320 --> 03:56:57.440]  must be charged with the crimes they've committed and they must be prosecuted by
[03:56:57.440 --> 03:57:02.800]  the Trump administration and the DOJ along with the deep state traders by the
[03:57:02.800 --> 03:57:08.640]  way who may be facing prosecution very soon we'll see what William Barr is up
[03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:12.280]  to but from what I'm hearing there are some criminal charges coming down that
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:15.680]  are going to target those deep state traders who tried to overthrow our
[03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:19.080]  country tried to steal an election tried to frame Donald Trump and they
[03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:23.400]  failed and they got caught they're gonna go to prison some of them are gonna be
[03:57:23.400 --> 03:57:28.160]  putting a cell like Jeffrey Epstein tell you what they've they've got some some
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:32.560]  things coming stay tuned over Shroy is coming up next with war room this is
[03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:36.680]  infowars Mike Adams filling in today thank you for watching God bless America
[03:57:36.680 --> 03:57:41.560]  till next time
