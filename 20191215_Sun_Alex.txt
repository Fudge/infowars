[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:17.160 --> 00:23.920]  On Monday, I could feel the surge the shift in the spirit of not just America, but the world
[00:23.920 --> 00:31.680]  And with the menace of the phone and the ring, the text, he had a husband, Owen Schreuer called out the
[00:31.680 --> 00:36.760]  emperors new clothes. He had called out the fact that the whole thing was a giant fraud and that
[00:36.760 --> 00:43.600]  basic truth like Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself resonated across the planet, not just the
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.280]  United States. And now here we are six, seven days later and politicians and globalists are
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.240]  being confronted all over the place. And it's only going to get more intense. The globalist
[00:56.240 --> 01:00.880]  ladies and gentlemen loaded the gun and pointed it at our head. But now we're taking the gun
[01:00.880 --> 01:09.040]  politically away from them. And they can sense that their doom that their defeat is now inevitable.
[01:09.040 --> 01:15.600]  The only question is, can they take us down with them? This is a live global transmission
[01:15.600 --> 01:24.000]  Sunday, December 15, 2019 with your host, Owen Schreuer. That's right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.640]  Owen Schreuer back in studio with a battle worn voice, as you can tell on this Sunday, December
[01:32.640 --> 01:40.400]  15, 2019. I have all the powerful clips to illustrate exactly what Alex Jones is talking about
[01:40.400 --> 01:48.160]  coming up for you in the next two hours. But I want to just say this before we begin with that
[01:48.160 --> 01:53.920]  and more from Alex Jones coming up in the first and second hour, as well as powerful clips.
[01:57.840 --> 02:04.960]  When I stepped up in front of Congress on Monday and made international news,
[02:04.960 --> 02:11.600]  it was about showing people how easy it is to take action.
[02:14.240 --> 02:23.440]  And it was instinctual. And it was based in truth and reality. And so it resonated.
[02:23.440 --> 02:36.160]  And the exact same thing happened to me in 2016, when Info Wars reporters and camera crew were on
[02:36.160 --> 02:44.400]  the ground in St. Louis, Missouri. And I simply went to the Trump rally that day. And this was
[02:44.400 --> 02:50.000]  before things really got that hot. If you can even wind the clock back with me in your mind and
[02:50.000 --> 03:00.880]  relive this historic landscape of time. But on that fateful day, Info Wars reporters caught me
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.480]  in an exchange with the Trump protesters, the Trump haters. Now, you may recall this moment,
[03:06.480 --> 03:14.080]  this video as Abe Skrillex and Carl the Cuck got seen millions of times, went totally viral,
[03:14.080 --> 03:23.200]  went totally viral still to this day as legend. And so all that illustrated was how flimsy these
[03:23.200 --> 03:28.400]  Trump supporters are, how brainwashed, excuse me, how flimsy the Trump protesters are versus how
[03:28.400 --> 03:35.600]  strong the Trump supporters are. Intellectually, I mean, I can go on with all the different
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.120]  characteristics, but you understand what I'm saying. And so because of that, other people
[03:41.120 --> 03:48.480]  started taking action. And so now in 2019, that is an entire genre of entertainment,
[03:48.480 --> 03:55.600]  that is an entire genre of content. Trump supporters or just media going up to Trump
[03:55.600 --> 03:59.680]  protesters and confronting them on what they think they know, what they think they believe.
[03:59.680 --> 04:03.600]  Whether it's why should Trump be impeached, whether it's why Trump is racist, whether it's why
[04:03.600 --> 04:08.880]  Trump is this, that or the other thing, they can ever answer the bell. It exposes the fraud
[04:08.880 --> 04:12.720]  of the mainstream news. It exposes how the mainstream news brainwashes people.
[04:12.720 --> 04:19.360]  It exposes how the Trump protesters are all just parroting talking points to here on the
[04:19.360 --> 04:25.440]  media and they can't actually go down it. So now here we are in 2019. And let me tell you this,
[04:25.440 --> 04:36.080]  folks, this is the new genre. This is the new content, confronting politicians legally and
[04:36.080 --> 04:42.880]  lawfully with the facts, with the truth, with the reality, and then exposing how the system
[04:42.880 --> 04:48.960]  wants that shut down, exposing how the system has a two-tiered system where I'm allegedly obstructing
[04:48.960 --> 04:56.800]  Congress, but not Nadler. And that is the breaking point we are at right now in America. And the
[04:56.800 --> 05:03.680]  revolution will only be broadcast on InfoWars. The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come

[06:26.800 --> 06:44.160]  To say that a global awakening is taking place is an understatement. There is a massive seismic,
[06:44.160 --> 06:52.720]  cultural, political, spiritual, and economic realignment as humanity that has been in a deep
[06:52.720 --> 07:00.640]  entertainment-induced and drug-induced and spiritually-induced coma begins to awaken
[07:01.200 --> 07:07.120]  to our surroundings. And the power structure has tried to bully and intimidate everyone back into
[07:07.120 --> 07:12.720]  submission. They've tried to trigger race wars, culture war, but all of it is now backfiring.
[07:12.720 --> 07:19.680]  And yes, the showtrial that they've had in the House, the kangaroo court railroading,
[07:19.680 --> 07:26.400]  has woken up even the dullest Democrat and liberals that I personally know that many others know,
[07:26.400 --> 07:33.120]  and they recognize that the fundamental assault onto process endangers everyone
[07:33.120 --> 07:39.920]  and our fundamental values. And the total unfairness of it has finally broken the camel's back.
[07:39.920 --> 07:45.440]  The left loves censorship now. They love tyranny. They love oppressing their political opposition.
[07:45.440 --> 07:53.360]  But to witness the showtrial that they've had in the House was a bridge too far.
[07:54.080 --> 08:00.000]  And so now you're going to see them eviscerated. You're going to see them destroyed in the Senate.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.720]  The Democrats are planning though to bring forward new scandals, and it'll be from the
[08:04.720 --> 08:08.400]  same playbook, women claiming that Trump assaulted them, people claiming they heard
[08:08.400 --> 08:15.040]  Trump say racist things. Obviously, none of it's going to be true. And I've previously been worried.
[08:15.040 --> 08:20.880]  I've previously been concerned that during the Senate trial, they could try to trigger enough
[08:20.880 --> 08:28.320]  of this to get civil unrest going. But so far, the House fiasco has been so badly handled by the
[08:28.320 --> 08:34.000]  arrogant Adam Schiff and others that you can feel it. You can see it. You can taste it. You can smell
[08:34.000 --> 08:41.600]  it. They have absolutely blown any credibility they had. No one is buying anything they have to say.
[08:41.600 --> 08:47.840]  And so now I agree with Trump that go ahead and have a long trial in the Senate. Let them call
[08:47.840 --> 08:53.840]  who they want. Let Trump call who he wants. Let Schiff be drug up there. And this is going
[08:53.840 --> 08:57.600]  to be their waterloo. Now they're going to strike back with false flags. They're going to strike
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.080]  back with all sorts of nasty garbage, staged events that you know they're getting ready to trigger.
[09:02.880 --> 09:08.640]  But they've been caught lying so much against Kavanaugh and so much against myself and just
[09:08.640 --> 09:13.760]  everybody else that it just isn't going to work anymore because the general public fundamentally
[09:13.760 --> 09:19.600]  understand that Trump is a populist. He's not even a Republican. And he's trying to restart the
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.040]  economy. He's trying to get peace deals. He's trying to get our troops to come home. He's trying
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.440]  to secure our border. And people have a self preservation instinct and understand what's
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.840]  happening. So this is a very important moment. We should all be thanking God for the awakening
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.800]  we're seeing. The enemy is going to throw some curveballs, make no mistake that we're not out
[09:38.800 --> 09:44.720]  of the woods yet. But the warm is turning. A lot of amazing things are happening. And I talked about
[09:44.720 --> 09:52.720]  this on Monday. I felt it as I was literally getting dressed, getting ready to go to work.
[09:52.720 --> 09:57.440]  I just felt this surge of energy. And I ran out in the living room and I told my wife, I said,
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.360]  the answer is getting people to go confront these politicians and to confront these globalists
[10:03.360 --> 10:06.560]  at the city level, the state level, the federal level, the international level,
[10:06.560 --> 10:12.400]  and to have our voices heard and to really get into the streets and to show that the mainstream
[10:12.400 --> 10:16.720]  media is lying and that the majority of people disagree with it. That will be the visual cue,
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.520]  just like in Viva Vendetta, to politically break the back of this. And she said, she said, yeah,
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.640]  that's common sense. Of course, that's what you're supposed to do when the government and the media
[10:28.640 --> 10:34.480]  are lying to you, or at least large factions of it. And I said, yes, but I'm saying I feel it
[10:34.480 --> 10:39.440]  happening now. I know it's going to happen. I'm not saying that that's just the answer.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.920]  I'm saying I'm feeling that it's happening. I feel this incredible optimism surging over me,
[10:46.880 --> 10:51.920]  a huge disturbance in the force to use a cheesy analogy of Star Wars. She said, oh,
[10:51.920 --> 10:58.560]  five minutes later, my phone starts ringing off the hook. So again, I want to be totally clear.
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.000]  It's not just that hitting the streets is the answer. It's already happening.
[11:05.200 --> 11:08.880]  I could feel the sea change. Many other people called in. They could feel it as well. No one
[11:08.880 --> 11:14.560]  could feel it. And right as I was having that surge of energy, of awakening, of optimism,
[11:15.200 --> 11:18.720]  like a breath of fresh air, it was amazing. Ever since anything like it in my life,
[11:18.720 --> 11:27.440]  it was a feeling of like a victory, a God's promise, a guarantee. The phone starts ringing,
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.480]  text start coming in, and the media is saying, did you put Owen Schroder up to this? Did you see
[11:32.480 --> 11:37.520]  what happened? And it sounded great. It looked great. I was very proud of Owen. But then I began
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.680]  to see the huge effect it had with others as they began to realize that that is the answer.
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.160]  And then sure enough now, we've seen confrontations peacefully carried out across the United States,
[11:48.160 --> 11:57.440]  across Europe, across the world, explode since last Monday. And I've seen politicians and leaders
[11:57.440 --> 12:03.040]  and movie stars and so many others come out and say what Owen Schroder did was the answer.
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.280]  And again, it's on its face. It's prima facie. Of course, it's totally obvious. I'm not saying
[12:07.280 --> 12:12.400]  something you don't already know. I'm saying grass is green, the sky is blue. And, you know,
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.040]  God put the sky up there, so little birdies wouldn't bump their heads. Okay, I'm joking now.
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.760]  Now, what I'm saying is this is it. You can feel it. It's happening. It's really happening.
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.280]  And the globalists are absolutely in deep trouble. But we've all now got to take
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.520]  this opportunity in our hands and realize that destiny is laying out before us,
[12:31.520 --> 12:37.280]  but it's up to all of you, whether it's calling into a radio show, or whether it's marching
[12:37.280 --> 12:40.480]  on demonstration, or whether it's calling Congress, or whether it's bullhorning the
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.400]  White House and calling for an end of censorship, or whether it's sending an email or telling
[12:44.400 --> 12:50.880]  somebody about infowars.com, or saying, you know, the Clintons killed Epstein. It's that human action
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.520]  that will bring them down, just like people going around saying Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill
[12:55.520 --> 13:01.120]  himself, became a way to say, hey, the globalists are liars. We need to take America back. Don't
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.520]  believe the mainstream media. Don't believe the establishment passed it on. That's just simply
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.880]  a call sign for people to know that they're wearing their colors loud and proud, that they're awake
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.280]  and getting more awake every moment, and that they're going to awake others up with solidarity,
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.480]  unity of understanding, this is so exciting. I mean, I just cannot come up with words to describe
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.560]  how powerful this moment is. And so now if people start talking about infowars.com,
[13:29.440 --> 13:36.240]  as a similar card, or as a similar flag of saying Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself,
[13:36.240 --> 13:40.480]  that's already happening. And then if they visit info wars, it's not just about understanding
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.640]  they got a lot to do about Epstein. It's about discovering the entire lie. And that's what the
[13:44.640 --> 13:51.040]  power structure is so incredibly scared of right now. And that's why again, this is such a magic
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.960]  moment. And that's why you as the core audience of activists are the detonator in this whole situation
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.640]  that can bring in the next level of the revolution against the satanic tyranny,
[14:00.640 --> 14:07.680]  and literally bring it down. So again, ladies and gentlemen, if the new activism isn't Jeffrey
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.680]  Epstein didn't kill himself, keep saying that that's great. And it's obviously true. And it's
[14:11.680 --> 14:16.320]  saying we don't buy the lie. We're not buying the mind control. If you go to the next level and start
[14:16.320 --> 14:23.360]  saying, get out, be active, confront the globalist. In 2016, it was Bill Clinton's a rapist. Well,
[14:23.360 --> 14:29.040]  what is it going to be in 2019 and 2020? We should all have a debate about that on air,
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.600]  we should have a discussion about that on air. But it's not just going to be one term probably,
[14:33.600 --> 14:40.400]  it's going to be a whole group of terms in a cascade of an awakening, a type of epiphany,
[14:40.400 --> 14:45.360]  singularity that we're discussing. They want the censorship and control to be their victory.
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.600]  It's actually triggering their defeat. And so as people realize coming out of their shells,
[14:49.600 --> 14:56.320]  being vocal, being active in small ways every day leads to big ways. Now, speaking of action,
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.120]  Owen Schroyer is taking over right now for the balance of the broadcast. I want to thank him
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.840]  for his great work. I obviously wanted to host today's show, but I want Owen to be front and
[15:05.840 --> 15:11.680]  center on not just this broadcast, but throughout the Week at Info Wars, because what he did,
[15:11.680 --> 15:17.120]  though it seems simple, was a real act of courage and has resonated with so many people asking,
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.440]  why haven't I done this? Why haven't other people done this? And we are on the verge
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.800]  of the beginning of the end of the NWO. It's going to be rough. It's going to take years,
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.920]  but you can feel the momentum has really shifted in the beginning of the end of this
[15:31.920 --> 15:39.040]  technocracy has begun. InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.Video. Tomorrow's news today. Back to
[15:39.040 --> 15:45.600]  Owen Schroyer in the live broadcast. Wow. What a powerful time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.720]  And even since I've been back from that epic trip, which I could say is one of the most important
[15:52.720 --> 15:58.320]  weeks of my life, I've had more of an understanding about how important it all is. We'll be right back.
[16:22.880 --> 16:27.760]  the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And so it's very
[16:27.760 --> 16:32.800]  simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which
[16:32.800 --> 16:39.040]  God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort 110% God will finish the move. And I know
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.760]  I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.040]  globalists and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.720]  to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you
[16:50.720 --> 16:55.280]  keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself,

[17:52.000 --> 17:57.360]  products info or store.com. That's info or store.com. Please take action.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.720]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech. I actually read it in a book about
[18:06.720 --> 18:11.760]  Winston Churchill many years ago and I've found a few places where it's mentioned. But if you can
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.920]  find it, please send it to show tips info wars.com. And he talked about in the darkest hours at the
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.480]  beginning of World War two, the fact that there have been times in history where people had a
[18:20.480 --> 18:24.400]  chance to stand up and fight early on and we're sure to victory. Then there was a second point
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.760]  in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep. There's a
[18:29.760 --> 18:35.440]  third time when you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and
[18:35.440 --> 18:40.320]  being slowly killed is much, much worse. That's a paraphrase. But ladies and gentlemen, we are in
[18:40.320 --> 18:44.960]  the position now of being able to win this easily. If we find our spirit, find our focus
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.840]  and don't give up and take action. But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip
[18:49.840 --> 18:55.760]  number two and go right to number three. That's a fact. They fear info wars because we are alive.
[18:55.760 --> 19:02.720]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future. Sometimes the right thing to do
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.640]  is the easy thing to do. It's the healthy thing to do. It's the thing that makes all of our lives
[19:08.640 --> 19:14.240]  better. And that's taking care of our individual health. And it's never been easier to do the
[19:14.240 --> 19:20.240]  right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarstore.com and get the highest quality
[19:20.240 --> 19:26.080]  supplements that are life changing in what they will do for you and your family's body,
[19:26.080 --> 19:31.120]  your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido. But then of course,
[19:31.120 --> 19:36.400]  it also funds the info war that is so incredibly critical. Where else can you spend your hard
[19:36.400 --> 19:41.280]  iron money knowing that it's a true 360 win? Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.320]  with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working
[19:46.320 --> 19:51.280]  against you and your family's future. Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings
[19:51.280 --> 19:57.760]  and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com.
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.280]  Please make the right decision.
[19:59.280 --> 20:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:05.840 --> 20:32.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. And now your host,
[20:32.240 --> 20:42.320]  Owen Troyer. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to play
[20:48.240 --> 20:55.920]  a compilation from all of last week's activities. And it's amazing to even have to boil this down
[20:55.920 --> 21:04.400]  to five minutes. Let me just lay it all out for you. But you have a little context of this
[21:04.400 --> 21:12.080]  compilation. On Sunday night, I arrived in Washington, DC, where I was met by congressman
[21:12.080 --> 21:18.000]  Al Green. I consider a friend of mine. I said, Al, Americans are sick of this impeachment.
[21:18.560 --> 21:25.280]  He went on to call me a racist and then incited a mob against me. Monday, I then went to cover
[21:25.280 --> 21:29.840]  the impeachment hearings for info wars. Yes, just to cover, not to disrupt,
[21:30.480 --> 21:36.720]  but because of my instinct and my fed up nature with Jerry Nadler and the rest of these Democrats,
[21:36.720 --> 21:44.720]  I couldn't help but stand up and say something. Then Tuesday, we went to one of the biggest
[21:44.720 --> 21:50.560]  Trump rallies yet, maybe top five, potentially top 10, but definitely top 10.
[21:50.560 --> 21:57.520]  And we went out there with the info wars, battle tank or truck or info truck, whatever you want
[21:57.520 --> 22:01.840]  to call it, maybe we'll have an official vote someday. We bullhorned the protesters. We talked
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.600]  to all the great people. But more importantly, we documented the fact that in the cold freezing
[22:05.600 --> 22:12.320]  rain, Trump had over 20,000 people out in a battleground state with less than 200 protesters.
[22:12.320 --> 22:20.160]  There's a total difference than from this point in 2016 or at least where they thought they would be.
[22:22.640 --> 22:28.240]  Then we went up to New York City, where we took the info wars, battle truck again,
[22:28.240 --> 22:33.600]  through Times Square bullhorring that Jeffrey Epstein isn't dead. We went back the next day.
[22:34.800 --> 22:39.920]  Bullhorring all through the city had a peaceful protest outside of the New York Times who wants
[22:39.920 --> 22:45.120]  to shut down the First Amendment in America. Then Friday went back to DC during the scam
[22:45.120 --> 22:52.160]  impeachment hearings to bullhorn again against that scam. So here is the compilation of the
[22:52.160 --> 22:56.800]  week that was, which I want to thank the info wars audience for making this possible.
[22:57.680 --> 23:02.400]  And I really want to give all glory to God for giving me the strength to do it
[23:02.400 --> 23:10.160]  and the opportunity. So here is the compilation from last week's epic coverage.
[23:10.160 --> 23:14.640]  Congressman Al Green, how are you today, man?
[23:14.640 --> 23:18.720]  Better than I deserve. Do you remember me? I think we met over here.
[23:18.720 --> 23:22.880]  Yeah, oh my gosh. I'm actually really honored you remember me. I saw what you said on Friday.
[23:23.440 --> 23:25.600]  I don't know what I said on Friday. I said a lot.
[23:25.600 --> 23:30.480]  You called the president racist again. And you were projecting your race baiting onto him again.
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.320]  Well, you know, you have your opinion and I have mine.
[23:34.320 --> 23:40.560]  But that's a serious allegation now. Well, Al, he's not a racist. Here's what I want to say now.
[23:40.560 --> 23:43.440]  Are you a racist? No, obviously not a racist. Are you a racist?
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.440]  It is obvious to me. You're calling me a racist, huh?
[23:46.720 --> 23:51.360]  That is absurd, Al. Let me introduce you to a racist who follows me around.
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.280]  Yeah, I support President Trump like I'm sure many people here do.
[23:55.280 --> 23:59.840]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing. I will make an opening statement.
[23:59.840 --> 24:02.880]  And then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[24:03.520 --> 24:06.080]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[24:07.200 --> 24:12.560]  We will hear 30-minute opening arguments from councils for the majority and the minority
[24:12.560 --> 24:12.960]  of this.
[24:21.440 --> 24:25.760]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country.
[24:25.760 --> 24:28.880]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes.
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.080]  You are, Jerry Nadler. You're the one committing treason.
[24:32.080 --> 24:36.800]  America's done with this. America's sent to the trees and committed by Democrat Party.
[24:37.520 --> 24:41.920]  They're not going to sit here and watch you run in the streets and remove our vote.
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.080]  We voted for Donald Trump and they're simply removing it because they don't like it.
[24:46.080 --> 24:50.800]  Americans are sick of their impeachment stand-up. They're sick of the Democrat treason.
[24:50.800 --> 25:00.400]  We got the committee to prime and it wasn't Trump. Trump is in it.
[25:00.400 --> 25:05.280]  The committee will come to order. Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind
[25:05.280 --> 25:11.280]  everyone present that the audience is here to observe, but not to demonstrate,
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.960]  not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee.
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.360]  There was not enough, uh, the content kind of wrapped up when you guys kind of got completely
[25:21.360 --> 25:24.800]  wiped off the stage when nobody paid it. Oh, really? Because your show got canceled.
[25:24.800 --> 25:28.160]  My show's still on the air. You had a cable network behind you and failed,
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.840]  and now we're shooting a documentary no one cares about and trying to make fun of me.
[25:31.840 --> 25:35.360]  I was in Congress yesterday changing the world yesterday.
[25:35.360 --> 25:39.680]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country.
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.800]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes.
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.080]  You are, Jerry Nadler. You're the one committing treason.
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.000]  America's done with this. That's right. Oh, I did see that.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.120]  Uh, I think that was the taxpayer dollars, uh, and worth.
[25:53.120 --> 25:56.720]  We'll send the bottle to your boss. Do you support the impeachment?
[25:57.520 --> 26:02.000]  Oh, is there an impeachment going on? Okay, all right.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.040]  Oh, he doesn't want to talk to Info Wars.
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.680]  He just tries to make fun of Info Wars for a couple months on Comedy Central and fails.
[26:09.680 --> 26:12.800]  And then he runs away as soon as Info Wars puts a mic in his face.
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.440]  Oh, I thought you weren't allowed. I thought you weren't allowed in here.
[26:17.440 --> 26:20.000]  You're not allowed in here. I thought you weren't allowed in here.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.040]  Look at these LARPers pretending to fight Nazis.
[26:24.400 --> 26:25.680]  Get that out of my face!
[26:30.240 --> 26:31.440]  Get that out of my face!
[26:31.440 --> 26:43.200]  Get that out of my face!
[26:43.200 --> 26:59.840]  This is me on the PA in front of the New York Times.
[27:07.920 --> 27:09.680]  There he is right there, what'd I tell you?
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.320]  Yeah, Democrats are real easy to spot. They're filled with hate.
[27:19.200 --> 27:19.920]  Wrong!
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.200]  Look at how much Jones lives at InfoWars.com!
[27:25.680 --> 27:27.120]  You guys hate free speech, huh?
[27:28.320 --> 27:31.760]  So while you're gathering with your loved ones over the holiday season,
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.680]  just remember that free testing isn't doing that.
[27:35.680 --> 27:42.560]  Now in front of Congress in the InfoTruck bullhorning.
[28:05.920 --> 28:28.560]  Wow, just sitting here reliving it all. It was quite a crazy week indeed.
[28:28.560 --> 28:32.320]  And again, I thank the InfoWars audience for making it all possible folks.
[28:32.320 --> 28:35.040]  None of it would be possible if you didn't support us.
[28:35.040 --> 28:38.560]  And you know how that goes down. We're supported by you. That's it.
[28:39.200 --> 28:42.880]  Shopping at InfoWars.com, getting water filters, getting air filters,
[28:42.880 --> 28:46.960]  getting hats and t-shirts. They want to shut down so that we can't do that.
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.680]  They want to shut down so that InfoWars can't create that content and change the world.
[28:52.640 --> 28:55.760]  So don't let them shut us down, folks. More on the other side.
[28:59.600 --> 29:02.080]  It's time to take yourself to the next level.
[29:02.080 --> 29:05.600]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old
[29:05.600 --> 29:12.560]  or young. As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down. Now in 60 seconds,
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.520]  I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.760]  prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis. And then it just gets wilder
[29:23.760 --> 29:30.320]  from there. Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone.
[29:30.320 --> 29:36.160]  We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high-quality vitamins and minerals in
[29:36.160 --> 29:42.160]  Real Red Pill. Real Red Pill Plus has some added energy as well. Now you can get it for 65% off
[29:42.160 --> 29:47.120]  with a free bottle of Biotrusillenium that's from the mustard seed. The two go together in an
[29:47.120 --> 29:54.400]  incredible way. The Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, 65% off with a free bottle of Biotrusillenium
[29:54.400 --> 30:01.120]  at M4store.com through the new year. Change your life, take yourself to the next level. If it isn't
[30:01.120 --> 30:07.200]  broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code,
[30:07.200 --> 30:13.840]  genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then
[30:13.840 --> 30:20.240]  destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the
[30:20.240 --> 30:28.160]  family. We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level
[30:28.160 --> 30:36.080]  of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters
[30:36.080 --> 30:41.680]  who wish more than anything to play God. I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new
[30:41.680 --> 30:49.440]  systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us. This is the forced seduction
[30:49.440 --> 30:54.400]  of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate
[30:54.400 --> 30:59.680]  tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.760]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you. Before I go
[31:05.760 --> 31:09.520]  ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products. A little bit
[31:09.520 --> 31:15.760]  about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[31:15.760 --> 31:21.200]  I used to have a problem with Adderall. I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its
[31:21.200 --> 31:25.520]  energy boosting properties. I got a little out of hand and I listen to you religiously in my
[31:25.520 --> 31:30.800]  truck every day. I tried your turbo force and it's a cliche. This product changed my life,
[31:30.800 --> 31:36.080]  but turbo force really changed my life. It was a day I no longer take Adderall. I get by literally
[31:36.080 --> 31:41.680]  the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force. If you take a half a packet,
[31:41.680 --> 31:45.760]  that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is,
[31:45.760 --> 31:50.240]  what, $4.99? And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is. And
[31:50.240 --> 31:53.440]  if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it. We're really proud of turbo force,
[31:53.440 --> 31:57.440]  so thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com. Then help us spread the
[31:57.440 --> 32:07.760]  word. Let's just get busy. M4store.com. Twilight is here. The sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle
[32:07.760 --> 32:14.160]  into the year 2020. Only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[32:15.280 --> 32:18.800]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision
[32:18.800 --> 32:24.800]  and his protection. He's completely surrounded and to pray for him to have discernment and to
[32:24.800 --> 32:30.480]  be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if
[32:30.480 --> 32:35.600]  he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office. They're trying to remove him
[32:35.600 --> 32:42.960]  regardless because they know that God put him in office and that he's going to continue his work
[32:42.960 --> 32:47.440]  and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down. But that if he doesn't execute in
[32:47.440 --> 32:51.600]  that office that God's given him, that the globalist could win. Ladies and gentlemen,
[32:51.600 --> 32:55.680]  now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for M4 Wars
[32:55.680 --> 32:59.680]  and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist. Thank you and God bless you all.
[32:59.680 --> 33:11.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.680 --> 33:32.240]  Waging war on corruption. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Owen
[33:32.240 --> 33:36.240]  Troyer. All right, let's continue with these clips, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:36.240 --> 33:44.800]  Let's first go to now. This was the winner of the Info Wars Paul Revere award.
[33:45.440 --> 33:53.520]  Just another channel goes out to the Joe Biden event in San Antonio and confronted Joe Biden.
[33:53.520 --> 34:07.520]  Here is how that went.
[34:23.520 --> 34:37.520]  That's a lie, Joe. That's a lie. Yeah. And it was your son and the Ukraine.
[34:44.240 --> 34:46.800]  You're the one that offered to withhold a billion dollars.
[34:46.800 --> 34:56.960]  The cancel of foreign relations. Son of a bitch, he got fired, right, Joe? Son of a bitch,
[34:56.960 --> 35:06.960]  he got fired, right? Remember that? Trump is innocent. Trump is innocent. Info Wars dot com.
[35:06.960 --> 35:21.040]  You'll never be president. Your son is a crackhead. Your son is a crackhead, Joe.
[35:21.760 --> 35:26.960]  What do you think about that? Son of a bitch, he got fired, right?
[35:28.720 --> 35:34.960]  You're not giving the billion dollars, right, Joe? There's your quid pro quo, Joe.
[35:34.960 --> 35:40.880]  There's your quid pro quo, brother. Info Wars dot com.
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.960]  Total victory. Total victory from just another channel dot com. Who's going to be on me,
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.640]  the war room with me next week. But I want to go back to the beginning of this
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.200]  to just show you what Democrats are doing. Play the first 15 seconds of that again.
[35:57.200 --> 36:04.320]  We are the nation. We can't let this happen. This election is about the soul of our nation.
[36:08.160 --> 36:12.240]  No, that's Joe Biden. No, that's the Democrats.
[36:15.840 --> 36:18.800]  That's literally all the Democrats. So you can pull us out, but you see what they're doing.
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.960]  They're running a campaign of hate. They're running a campaign of division, folks.
[36:22.960 --> 36:28.400]  That is their entire campaign. And imagine a group of people that actually believe that.
[36:28.400 --> 36:35.840]  It's scary to think. Let's move on. Now the great Will Johnson also took action last week and confronted
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.480]  the Oopa Loopa, who lost his way from Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, Jerry Nadler.
[36:42.480 --> 36:49.360]  I mean, any comment?
[36:51.840 --> 36:53.840]  Nadler, how do you think the voters are going to look at this?
[36:55.280 --> 36:57.200]  How do you think the voters are going to look at this in the future?
[36:58.960 --> 37:04.560]  2020, Nadler, broken your own. But you know what? Keep doing it. Keep doing it because the American
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.200]  people see through it. It's going to work in President Trump's favor. Keep it up. Keep it up.
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.840]  It's just going to give votes to Trump. Shame on you, sir. Trump 2020.
[37:13.840 --> 37:16.720]  You're going to make it for Trump. 2020.
[37:19.360 --> 37:25.920]  And then his elevator won't close just so the goblin creature has to take more of the truth.
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.120]  Oh, God, if Providence is just raining down on us right now. Oh, my gosh. Oh, I mean,
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.120]  I won't get into it with folks, but it's just like I said, even with me personally,
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.880]  I, but look, that other voice you heard there, Will Johnson and Bobby Jeffries,
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.160]  who's running for Congress in Florida as well, confronting peacefully, legally, lawfully Jerry
[37:46.160 --> 37:54.560]  Nadler. There you have it again, total victory. Now here is an Adam Schiff event that went totally
[37:54.560 --> 38:07.680]  haywire.
[38:07.680 --> 38:22.800]  This is a ship trying to hold an event being confronted by American patriots here.
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.360]  They have signs that say Trump 2020. And there's multiple people
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.920]  chanting liar as you can hear. So there you go. Another total victory.
[38:51.040 --> 38:56.640]  And that's the key folks. These people have been walking around unscathed for decades. America's
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.200]  rising up. And you can sit here and believe me, I won't make an issue of this, but there's conservatives
[39:01.200 --> 39:07.280]  that hate this crap. They say, don't do that. That's what the left does. That's just crap.
[39:07.280 --> 39:11.520]  No, no, no, no, no. This is America rising up and take action. This isn't what the left does.
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.360]  They have no truth behind them. We have truth behind us. That's why when we do it, it's successful.
[39:17.360 --> 39:24.320]  That's the difference. That's why it's important. Americans know Adam Schiff's a liar. Americans
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.000]  know Jerry Nadler's a liar. Americans know Trump is innocent. They're just waiting for somebody
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.080]  to scream it at the top of the mountain so that they can say, hey, there's somebody taking action.
[39:32.080 --> 39:40.240]  He's right. And of course, here was the moment that started it all Monday morning. Here is how
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.880]  the committee will proceed for this hearing. I will make an opening statement and then I will
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.760]  recognize the ranking member for an opening statement. After that, we will hear two sets of
[39:49.760 --> 39:56.000]  presentations. We will hear 30 minute opening arguments from councils for the majority and the
[39:56.000 --> 40:09.200]  majority of this committee. Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against
[40:09.200 --> 40:14.800]  this country. And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes. You are Jerry Nadler.
[40:14.800 --> 40:19.680]  You're the one committing treason. America's done with this. America's sent to the treason
[40:19.680 --> 40:29.360]  committed by the Democrat Party. We voted for Donald Trump and their people removed him because
[40:29.360 --> 40:35.200]  they don't like him. America's sent to the treason. They're sent to the Democrat treason.
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.720]  We held the committee to crime and it wasn't Trump. Trump is innocent.
[40:38.720 --> 40:50.480]  The committee will come to order. Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind everyone present
[40:50.480 --> 40:57.840]  that the audience is here to observe, but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.960]  disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee. Yeah, I'm Owen Schroder from
[41:02.960 --> 41:09.040]  infowords.com. What's your name? Owen Schroder. I think it's ironic I'm being
[41:09.040 --> 41:11.600]  pulled out of here when the Democrats are the ones committing crimes.
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.280]  I'm being arrested right now for disrobing Congress. I'm a criminal for my first amendment
[41:21.280 --> 41:47.440]  rights. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. And again, I've got more clips coming up,
[41:47.440 --> 41:52.880]  but Jerry Nadler has now successfully told you the entire mindset and plan of the Democrat Party.
[41:52.880 --> 41:58.480]  He said it right there. Your role as an American citizen is to sit down and shut up and let us
[41:58.480 --> 42:03.680]  run your lives. And last week, he also said he doesn't trust the American people to elect the
[42:03.680 --> 42:09.120]  president. He's telling you, you don't get to vote. They decide who the president is. So that
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.640]  they're admitting it, folks. They want to take the guns. They want to take the first amendment,
[42:12.640 --> 42:16.720]  and they want you to sit down and shut up so they can run the country. And if that isn't the
[42:16.720 --> 42:22.320]  antithesis of everything that is America, then I don't know what is and I will not stand by.
[42:23.600 --> 42:29.840]  So that's why we just had that epic week. That's why Alex Jones sent me on an uncharted mission
[42:30.480 --> 42:38.160]  from Uncharted Space, one that only God could give me the strength and clarity
[42:38.160 --> 42:44.400]  to complete successfully. But folks, believe me, none of it would be possible if you didn't
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.960]  support us at InfowarsStore.com. We wouldn't be able to fund the trips. We wouldn't be able to
[42:48.960 --> 42:54.320]  fund everything we do here and have this platform despite all the censorship that still reaches
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.040]  millions. So please support us at InfowarsStore.com. Big Christmas specials right now.

[44:02.240 --> 44:08.800]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us,
[44:09.360 --> 44:14.720]  poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions
[44:15.360 --> 44:21.200]  and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family. We're being taken
[44:21.200 --> 44:29.760]  off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot
[44:29.760 --> 44:36.160]  even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than
[44:36.160 --> 44:41.760]  anything to play God. I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we
[44:41.760 --> 44:49.760]  will willingly beg for them to implement against us. This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian
[44:49.760 --> 44:54.880]  world government model. This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon
[44:54.880 --> 45:01.760]  the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity. Driving into the
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.640]  operations center this morning, it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I need to reach directly
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.760]  out of the audience and just spell out the facts. When you spend your money at places like Dick's
[45:11.760 --> 45:17.600]  Sporting Goods, you're financing a group that gives huge amounts of money to gun control disarming
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.240]  you and your family. Then when you go down the list and look at these companies like Walmart,
[45:22.240 --> 45:26.240]  did you know they're doing the same thing now? Did you know that almost every big box store,
[45:26.240 --> 45:31.920]  including Target, they're the worst, are actually funding the transgender movement targeting
[45:31.920 --> 45:37.840]  children? Do you know what Jeff Bezos and Amazon's up to? Ladies and gentlemen, it'll make your head
[45:37.840 --> 45:43.520]  spin. Why in the hell are we supporting these people? Why are you going to buy your Christmas
[45:43.520 --> 45:49.920]  presents for your family from these institutions that hate America and hate your guts? Do your
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.800]  shopping at inforwarstore.com and get great products and then rest assured you're funding the
[45:54.800 --> 45:59.840]  resistance. You're funding the voice of liberty in the face of tyranny. Please shop at inforwarstore.com.

[46:14.720 --> 46:18.960]  that'll give you that for a while but then burn you out. But if you have the foundation of what

[47:20.400 --> 47:27.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[47:27.280 --> 47:36.960]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. And now your host Owen Shroyer.
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.800]  All right, we have been reviewing the footage from the week that was
[47:44.640 --> 47:53.200]  on an uncharted mission from Uncharted Space that the Infowars crew has been on the last week.
[47:53.200 --> 48:00.000]  And again, it really would not be possible if it wasn't for your support at InfowarsStore.com.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.800]  It wouldn't be possible for me to go on these trips and it wouldn't be possible for us to have this
[48:04.800 --> 48:13.360]  platform with millions of people to share it. And so your support at InfowarsStore.com is key
[48:13.360 --> 48:20.320]  in all of that. Now, we've got big Christmas specials happening right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[48:20.320 --> 48:31.920]  The 12 Days of Christmas rolls on. We're in day seven now. So you have 25% off all apparel.
[48:32.880 --> 48:39.600]  So the t-shirts, the hats, the winter stocking caps, the hoodies, the zip-ups, the polos,
[48:40.560 --> 48:47.280]  it's all 25% off. And some of them are even more deeply discounted than that.
[48:47.280 --> 48:58.560]  But that's the special for today. 25% off InfowarsApparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[48:58.560 --> 49:05.840]  And so I said I wanted to fund the last trip with people buying Space Force t-shirts.
[49:05.840 --> 49:12.480]  So if you want to go get the Space Force t-shirt, that is 25% off. The Trump is innocent t-shirt.
[49:12.480 --> 49:23.600]  That is 25% off. They're all 25% off. The popular It's OK to be OK hat, which by the way,
[49:25.200 --> 49:34.000]  I have a story on that. Academies Pro possible white power hand signs broadcast during Army
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.480]  Navy game. These people are so out of touch with reality they don't understand that the circle game
[49:38.480 --> 49:44.000]  when you do this is just a game you play. And if somebody looks at it, you get to punch them
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.680]  in the shoulder or whatever how you play with your friends. It's like what the guy did to the
[49:47.680 --> 49:51.600]  Cubs game got banned from the stadium. It's like what the guy did at the Army Navy game.
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.080]  Now the academies are looking into it. No, that's nothing. And in fact, even if you do it like
[49:56.080 --> 50:03.040]  that, it's nothing. So don't let these people end free speech. Don't let these people control language.
[50:03.040 --> 50:10.640]  You can get that hat 25% off at infowarstore.com. And as always, all the great supplements, folks,
[50:10.640 --> 50:16.560]  the air filters, the water filters, it's all at infowarstore.com. And again,
[50:17.440 --> 50:26.880]  your support makes it all possible. Now, here is a never before broadcast or seen clip
[50:26.880 --> 50:34.640]  from the Trump rally on Tuesday where we were, again, thanks to your support at infowarstore.com.
[50:35.200 --> 50:39.200]  This is one of the biggest Trump rallies. Right 20,000 people showed up for Trump in
[50:39.200 --> 50:45.360]  the pouring rain. They stayed hours through the day just to get in. Less than 200 Trump protesters
[50:45.360 --> 50:49.600]  showed up. And this was a well-funded protest. All the evidence is there. They got there at the
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.920]  same time. They left at the same time. Claude Taylor was there with this big inflatable rat.
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.400]  They had a little boxed off area. So it was obvious, but still it shows how failed
[50:59.280 --> 51:04.960]  the Trump protests are now. But here is the clip of info wars dominating.
[51:04.960 --> 51:22.880]  As far as the media is concerned, the Trump rally in Pennsylvania last Tuesday.
[51:34.960 --> 51:52.720]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
[51:52.800 --> 51:58.880]  Well this is me pulling up, right up to the Trump protesters in the info wars battle truck
[51:58.880 --> 52:00.880]  bullhorning on the P.A.
[52:00.880 --> 52:24.880]  And then there's some psycho protestor who tries to pretend we're Nazis even though we're the rejuvenation of America and our traditions and freedom and capitalism.
[52:30.880 --> 52:46.880]  I'm a white guy. I gotta be swear. I'm not from a shithole country. I'm a white guy.
[52:46.880 --> 53:02.880]  Yeah, I do your IQ is very low when they do the hey, hey, ho, ho, Trump has got to go. That's just my response. It's too easy. They do the same chant every time. I just shut it down.
[53:02.880 --> 53:14.880]  I came up with two chants to the same cadence of theirs. They've been using the same one for two years.
[53:14.880 --> 53:20.880]  And folks, by the way, we ended up dominating this event. There ended up being hundreds of Trump supporters that just dominated these protesters.
[53:20.880 --> 53:24.880]  And by the way, the protesters ended up chaining new SA, whatever that means.
[53:24.880 --> 53:37.880]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, why do you guys hate America so much?
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.880]  Hey, hey, ho, ho, Tommy's gone, that's got to go.
[53:41.880 --> 53:48.880]  Well third one. I've come up with the third one now. They're still on the same one.
[53:48.880 --> 53:50.880]  U.S.A. U.S.A.
[53:50.880 --> 53:52.880]  See, they're chanting New S.A.
[53:52.880 --> 53:54.880]  New S.A.
[53:54.880 --> 53:56.880]  See, folks, they're telling you what they want to do.
[53:56.880 --> 53:58.880]  They want to end America.
[53:58.880 --> 54:00.880]  Oh, Hillary.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.880]  Hillary was robbed.
[54:02.880 --> 54:04.880]  Why, Donald?
[54:04.880 --> 54:06.880]  Why, Donald Trump?
[54:06.880 --> 54:08.880]  Why, Donald Trump?
[54:08.880 --> 54:10.880]  Why do you have to do this to me?
[54:10.880 --> 54:12.880]  Without Hillary Clinton,
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.880]  I won't survive.
[54:14.880 --> 54:16.880]  I won't survive
[54:16.880 --> 54:20.880]  Okay, this is just me in a glass case of emotion,
[54:20.880 --> 54:22.880]  because Hillary lost.
[54:26.880 --> 54:28.880]  And I just see the crowd gathering.
[54:28.880 --> 54:30.880]  And it's become a point now.
[54:30.880 --> 54:32.880]  The protesters are just like a circus act, folks.
[54:32.880 --> 54:34.880]  It's literally like you're going to the zoo
[54:34.880 --> 54:36.880]  and you stop by the bear cage and say,
[54:36.880 --> 54:38.880]  wow, look at the bear.
[54:38.880 --> 54:44.880]  Ooh, look at the little penguin.
[54:44.880 --> 54:46.880]  Are they still chanting the same thing?
[54:46.880 --> 54:48.880]  Oh, my God.
[54:48.880 --> 54:50.880]  They're still chanting.
[54:50.880 --> 54:52.880]  They haven't even stopped.
[54:52.880 --> 54:54.880]  By the way, we have the spotlight on the truck.
[54:54.880 --> 54:56.880]  It's just hilarious.
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.880]  We can put a person in the spotlight.
[54:58.880 --> 55:08.880]  Hillary Clinton is very low.
[55:08.880 --> 55:10.880]  And he's got cash.
[55:10.880 --> 55:12.880]  Oh, it's Trump.
[55:12.880 --> 55:14.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:14.880 --> 55:16.880]  Oh, my God.
[55:16.880 --> 55:18.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:18.880 --> 55:20.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:20.880 --> 55:22.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:24.880 --> 55:26.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:26.880 --> 55:28.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:28.880 --> 55:30.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:30.880 --> 55:32.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:32.880 --> 55:34.880]  Santa likes Trump.
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.880]  What a glorious moment.
[55:40.880 --> 55:42.880]  I mean, I saw Santa Claus last week.
[55:42.880 --> 55:44.880]  I mean, does it get any better
[55:44.880 --> 55:46.880]  than that?
[55:46.880 --> 55:48.880]  I literally met Santa Claus last week
[55:48.880 --> 55:50.880]  and he comes out as a Trump supporter.
[55:50.880 --> 55:52.880]  That is amazing.
[55:52.880 --> 55:54.880]  So that's a very fun clip.
[55:54.880 --> 55:56.880]  We may have to air that again
[55:56.880 --> 55:58.880]  just for Brevity's sake.
[55:58.880 --> 56:00.880]  But let's go to one more clip, actually, guys,
[56:00.880 --> 56:02.880]  from that rally
[56:02.880 --> 56:04.880]  when a Trump protestor comes up to me
[56:04.880 --> 56:06.880]  and I've said this on air.
[56:06.880 --> 56:08.880]  I'm done dealing with their BS.
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.880]  I'm done taking their assault.
[56:10.880 --> 56:12.880]  I'm done taking their bullying.
[56:12.880 --> 56:14.880]  I know my rights. I know the law.
[56:14.880 --> 56:16.880]  So this lady comes up to me,
[56:16.880 --> 56:18.880]  points her amplified bullhorn
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.880]  right at my head with the siren on.
[56:20.880 --> 56:22.880]  Gets ready to stick it in my face.
[56:22.880 --> 56:24.880]  That can cause tinnitus.
[56:24.880 --> 56:26.880]  That can cause hearing damage and deafness.
[56:26.880 --> 56:28.880]  I'm not going to let you assault me.
[56:28.880 --> 56:30.880]  So she comes up with the bullhorn,
[56:30.880 --> 56:32.880]  getting ready to assault me with her amplified device
[56:32.880 --> 56:34.880]  and I swat it out of her hand.
[56:34.880 --> 56:36.880]  Now, I don't know if we'll have time to break it down in slow motion.
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.880]  I actually feel bad for the old lady
[56:38.880 --> 56:40.880]  who's probably over 60 years old,
[56:40.880 --> 56:42.880]  hasn't done anything physical in 20 years,
[56:42.880 --> 56:44.880]  tries to punch a 30-year-old man in the face
[56:44.880 --> 56:46.880]  and didn't end up going well for her.
[56:46.880 --> 56:48.880]  But here's that clip.
[56:48.880 --> 56:50.880]  I thought you weren't allowed in here, sir.
[56:50.880 --> 56:52.880]  I thought you weren't allowed.
[56:52.880 --> 56:54.880]  I thought you weren't allowed in here.
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.880]  You're not allowed in here.
[56:56.880 --> 56:58.880]  I thought you weren't allowed in here.
[56:58.880 --> 57:00.880]  Look at these LARPers pretending to fight Nazis.
[57:00.880 --> 57:02.880]  Get that out of my face.
[57:02.880 --> 57:04.880]  Get out of here.
[57:04.880 --> 57:06.880]  You can't put a noise in my fucking face.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.880]  Okay, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:08.880 --> 57:10.880]  Now, I don't know if we'll have time
[57:10.880 --> 57:12.880]  to break it down in slow motion.
[57:12.880 --> 57:14.880]  I don't know if we'll have time
[57:14.880 --> 57:16.880]  to break it down in slow motion.
[57:16.880 --> 57:18.880]  I don't know if we'll have time,
[57:18.880 --> 57:20.880]  but, again, I feel bad for this old lady.
[57:20.880 --> 57:22.880]  She probably hasn't done anything really that physical.
[57:22.880 --> 57:24.880]  She tried to knock me out with a punch.
[57:24.880 --> 57:26.880]  I gave her a shoulder roll, okay?
[57:26.880 --> 57:28.880]  She tried to punch a 30-year-old male,
[57:28.880 --> 57:30.880]  and, you know, let's just say
[57:30.880 --> 57:32.880]  I think her wrist might be in a sling, folks.
[57:32.880 --> 57:34.880]  I mean, I'm not saying
[57:34.880 --> 57:36.880]  she had a Joe Heisman broken leg moment,
[57:36.880 --> 57:38.880]  but if you go frame by frame,
[57:38.880 --> 57:40.880]  you can see she took a blow to her wrist
[57:40.880 --> 57:42.880]  that she did not expect.
[57:42.880 --> 57:44.880]  And I feel bad that they're so deranged
[57:44.880 --> 57:46.880]  that they've reached this point.
[57:46.880 --> 57:48.880]  At current sales rates,
[57:48.880 --> 57:50.880]  we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.880]  and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[57:52.880 --> 57:54.880]  But despite that,
[57:54.880 --> 57:56.880]  I'm still offering it
[57:56.880 --> 57:58.880]  at 65% off
[57:58.880 --> 58:00.880]  for those of you that have never experienced
[58:00.880 --> 58:02.880]  what is in the Real Red Pill
[58:02.880 --> 58:04.880]  and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[58:04.880 --> 58:06.880]  There is no one formula
[58:06.880 --> 58:08.880]  that you're going to find out there
[58:08.880 --> 58:10.880]  that is more game-changing.
[58:10.880 --> 58:12.880]  It's 65% off.
[58:12.880 --> 58:14.880]  Right now.
[58:14.880 --> 58:16.880]  That's very close to cost
[58:16.880 --> 58:18.880]  with a free bottle of our best-selling
[58:18.880 --> 58:20.880]  Biotru Selenium
[58:20.880 --> 58:22.880]  for the mustard seed.

[58:24.880 --> 58:26.880]  and will supercharge your energy,
[58:26.880 --> 58:28.880]  your focus, your entire body.
[58:28.880 --> 58:30.880]  The globalists know about this,
[58:30.880 --> 58:32.880]  but have been suppressing it.
[58:32.880 --> 58:34.880]  Take advantage of it now. The Real Red Pill

[58:44.880 --> 58:46.880]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[58:46.880 --> 58:48.880]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[58:48.880 --> 58:50.880]  You want to drive
[58:50.880 --> 58:52.880]  ice picks through their eyeballs
[58:52.880 --> 58:54.880]  spiritually. There's nowhere
[58:54.880 --> 58:56.880]  you can spend money.
[58:56.880 --> 58:58.880]  There's nowhere you can place your bet
[58:58.880 --> 59:00.880]  in a fight
[59:00.880 --> 59:02.880]  where it's going to have more
[59:02.880 --> 59:04.880]  hour per dollar.
[59:04.880 --> 59:06.880]  Your bang for your buck
[59:06.880 --> 59:08.880]  here gets you great products
[59:08.880 --> 59:10.880]  at great prices
[59:10.880 --> 59:12.880]  that literally
[59:12.880 --> 59:14.880]  fund the system
[59:14.880 --> 59:16.880]  where the spirit of resistance lives
[59:16.880 --> 59:18.880]  to drive it home to the enemy.
[59:18.880 --> 59:20.880]  It's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves
[59:20.880 --> 59:22.880]  and you want to see the fight
[59:22.880 --> 59:24.880]  taken to the enemy, which God wants to see,
[59:24.880 --> 59:26.880]  we have to make the effort. 110%
[59:26.880 --> 59:28.880]  God will finish the move
[59:28.880 --> 59:30.880]  and I know I need to stay in the fight
[59:30.880 --> 59:32.880]  in the attack, attack, attack.
[59:32.880 --> 59:34.880]  I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists
[59:34.880 --> 59:36.880]  and just believe me ladies and gentlemen
[59:36.880 --> 59:38.880]  that God wants somebody to commit to you and your family
[59:38.880 --> 59:40.880]  to fight for all of our futures together.
[59:40.880 --> 59:42.880]  You've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[59:42.880 --> 59:44.880]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got
[59:44.880 --> 59:46.880]  for us, for myself, for my family, for your family
[59:46.880 --> 59:48.880]  because we're in this together.
[59:48.880 --> 1:00:06.880]  And now, the tip of the spear.
[1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:10.880]  Leading the fight to take back the nation.
[1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:12.880]  It's Olin Troyer.
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:16.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:18.880]  It's time for the show to come.
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:20.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, including from Alex Jones
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:22.880]  on the other side of this first
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:24.880]  second hour break. Excuse me.
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:26.880]  But let's go first to how the mainstream media
[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:28.880]  and ask yourself this while you're watching it.
[1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:30.880]  Why is the mainstream media so desperate to lie?
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:32.880]  Why is the mainstream media
[1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:34.880]  so desperate to deceive the American people?
[1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:36.880]  Why are they so desperate to continue
[1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:38.880]  these false narratives? Why?
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:40.880]  And so here's a compilation
[1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:42.880]  of mainstream news
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:44.880]  mostly CNN, MSNBC
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:46.880]  rolling with the lie that the
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:48.880]  Steele dossier, the PP gate dossier
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.880]  which has been totally disproven
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:52.880]  just some fake opposition research
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:54.880]  funded by Hillary Clinton from
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:56.880]  Russian agents.
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:00:58.880]  That was confirmed by Bob Mueller. There's your Russian collusion.
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:00.880]  But it turns out none of it was real anyway.
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:02.880]  It was never corroborated by the FBI.
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:04.880]  But here's the fake American news
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:06.880]  lying to the American people
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:08.880]  even though they know it's not true.
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:10.880]  Parts of the now infamous dossier
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:12.880]  on Trump have proven to be true.
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:14.880]  I know the history of the dossier
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:16.880]  but it hasn't been discredited.
[1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:18.880]  In fact, it's been the opposite. It's been corroborated.
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:20.880]  Much of the dossier has been corroborated.
[1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:22.880]  This discredited dossier
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:24.880]  it hasn't been discredited.
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:26.880]  Your Intel community has corroborated
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:28.880]  all of the details in there.
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:30.880]  Some of the substantive content
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:32.880]  of the dossier
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:34.880]  we were able to corroborate
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:36.880]  in our Intel's community assessment
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:38.880]  which from other sources
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.880]  in which we had very high confidence.
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:42.880]  In the rise of application,
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:44.880]  the relevant parts of
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:46.880]  Christopher Steele's dossier
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.880]  were corroborated.
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:50.880]  If the application included
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:52.880]  information from the dossier
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:54.880]  it would only be after the FBI had
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:56.880]  in fact corroborated information
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:58.880]  through its own investigation.
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:00.880]  We also know that as time goes on
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.880]  more and more parts of the Steele dossier
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:04.880]  get corroborated.
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:06.880]  So when the President just refers to this fake dossier
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:08.880]  that is false.
[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:10.880]  This is a record characterization
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:12.880]  for the entirety of the dossier.
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:14.880]  The clear investigators have corroborated
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:16.880]  part of the dossier.
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:18.880]  The dossier has been corroborated
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:20.880]  by the Intel's community.
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:22.880]  US investigators have corroborated
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:24.880]  some of the allegations in that dossier.
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:26.880]  We do know that parts of it
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:28.880]  have been corroborated.
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:30.880]  It's not been corroborated
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:32.880]  but it hasn't been disproven either.
[1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:34.880]  Is there anything in the dossier
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:36.880]  that has been disproven?
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:38.880]  To date, none of it has been disproven.
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:40.880]  And whole big parts of it
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:42.880]  are holding up.
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:44.880]  The dossier holds up well.
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:46.880]  None of it has been disproven.
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:48.880]  All of the allegations in it, I don't know
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:50.880]  that anything has been disproven.
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:52.880]  It's a fact that none of it, not one word
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:54.880]  has been disproven. In fact
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:56.880]  a lot of it turned out to be right on the money.
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:58.880]  Former high ranking intelligence officials
[1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:00.880]  have told us on the record that there is nothing
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:02.880]  in the Steele dossier that they know
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.880]  to have been disproven.
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:06.880]  It has been corroborated. Do you not accept
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:08.880]  that they...
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:10.880]  I don't agree with that, Alice.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:12.880]  This is our reporting and this is what
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:14.880]  crime fighting agencies have said
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:16.880]  that the FBI would not have just taken
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.880]  a dossier to the FISA
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:20.880]  for and use that as their predicate.
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:22.880]  Criminal agencies.
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:24.880]  But no, I mean, I could write a dossier right now.
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:26.880]  I will write a dossier.
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:28.880]  In fact, I'm going to write a dossier right now, guys.
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:30.880]  Please, can I get this on Dock Cam?
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:32.880]  This is a very important dossier.
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:34.880]  All right.
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.880]  Now, do you guys have this here?
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:38.880]  Okay, I've just submitted
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:40.880]  a very important dossier here
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:42.880]  to the crew.
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:44.880]  Rachel Maddow eats
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:46.880]  horse manure.
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:48.880]  So does Anderson Cooper
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:50.880]  heard
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:52.880]  it from
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:54.880]  Russia.
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:56.880]  So does Anderson Cooper
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:03:58.880]  heard it
[1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:00.880]  from Russia.
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:02.880]  Okay, so there we go.
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:04.880]  Now,
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:06.880]  this has not been disproven.
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:08.880]  Okay?
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:10.880]  So I just wanted to be understood.
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:12.880]  It has not been disproven
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:14.880]  that Rachel Maddow dives headlong
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:16.880]  into a pile of horse manure
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:18.880]  and starts goblin.
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:20.880]  It's not been disproven.
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:22.880]  It's not been disproven that Anderson Cooper
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:24.880]  is sitting in that pile of
[1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:26.880]  dung waiting for her.
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:28.880]  It's not been disproven, folks.
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:30.880]  Now, you see what they do.
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:32.880]  That's literally what the mainstream media does
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:34.880]  and then tries to act like it's real.
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:36.880]  And then they have this mind game,
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:38.880]  this word game that they play
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:40.880]  on their audience to deceive them
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:42.880]  and they use the tool of repetition
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:44.880]  to drive it home and so now the audience thinks,
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:46.880]  oh, the Steele dossier, that's the real deal.
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:48.880]  They don't even know what it is or what's in it.
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:50.880]  But oh, yeah, the Steele dossier, that got Trump.
[1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:52.880]  That really got Trump, even though it's all fake.
[1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:54.880]  They literally made it up and they just say,
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:58.880]  it is proven, even though they made it up.
