[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:36.960]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we see Chinese government moving to have
[00:36.960 --> 00:43.440]  the yawn topple the dollar that's in Bloomberg we have secret missile test
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.280]  going on off the coast of California we have world government treaties openly
[00:50.280 --> 00:54.720]  being rammed through in secret and a world summit set for Paris France next
[00:54.720 --> 01:02.760]  month we have Britain and the United States naming Russia as the major
[01:02.760 --> 01:11.200]  threat to the world first the United States two weeks ago the UK today and in
[01:11.200 --> 01:19.360]  the midst of all this we have the suspension of reality more and more
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.520]  where political correctness has been so weaponized in Europe in the United
[01:23.520 --> 01:31.840]  States that if a professor's wife who heads up the student affairs group
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.880]  sends out a email saying don't get upset by Halloween parties if you see
[01:37.880 --> 01:43.000]  something a costume you don't like just don't look at it people have a right to
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.240]  their free speech that's what universities are and so they track down
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.360]  the husband who's also a professor at Yale and begin screaming at him and I
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.200]  covered this yesterday on the Sunday show but it's so illustrative of
[01:55.200 --> 01:59.680]  everything we're facing the mass mental illness the coddling of the young
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.280]  until they're completely mentally ill even Atlantic Monthly admitted it what
[02:04.280 --> 02:08.520]  what Camille Paglia talks about the end of a cycle the fall of civilization
[02:08.520 --> 02:13.120]  it's here is it a month from now or five years from now I don't know but much
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.800]  the world's already imploding and the New York Times has now reported on this
[02:17.800 --> 02:25.920]  it's been such a big story and they're reporting on it like it's okay Yale's
[02:25.920 --> 02:31.280]  Halloween advice stokes a racially charged debate maybe the president of
[02:31.280 --> 02:42.640]  Yale will resign maybe the football team or the rowing team will stand down and
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.560]  then they'll have everyone resigned effect just shut this whole school down
[02:45.560 --> 02:49.680]  you're there paying for pretty much worthless degrees anyways I've been
[02:49.680 --> 02:54.480]  saying that for 20 years now it's admitted most of you will never even get
[02:54.480 --> 03:00.920]  your money back and you're there bathed in political correctness running around
[03:00.920 --> 03:06.760]  barking at people and that ties into the University of Missouri just minutes
[03:06.760 --> 03:14.440]  ago 20 minutes ago president resigned over four campuses and I read for what
[03:14.440 --> 03:19.560]  they've got the football team crying and it's so hard what we've gone through
[03:19.560 --> 03:29.120]  supposedly a drunk frat person said something racial a year ago and then
[03:29.120 --> 03:35.200]  they tried to I guess block the the president's car with a black lives
[03:35.200 --> 03:41.960]  matter type deal and he didn't get out and so now he's resigned and you see
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.120]  apologizing wasn't enough and you just read this stuff it tells you where the
[03:47.120 --> 03:52.080]  culture and where the society is going because we've got serious problems
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.800]  we're going into a worldwide meltdown and we have been mentally disabled in
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.760]  fact you guys reprint me or pull out of the stack that Atlantic monthly 28-page
[04:00.760 --> 04:05.040]  article where top liberals described their children coming home from
[04:05.040 --> 04:10.160]  colleges completely mentally ill having panic attacks if they see brown bags
[04:10.160 --> 04:14.320]  brown you did that is right you're like excuse me are you okay there's a man and
[04:14.320 --> 04:23.640]  woman kissing it's sexist I saw a Halloween costume and we have video and
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.280]  audio of these college students aggressively saying shut up to the
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.320]  professor in his face everybody bowing up sticking their chest out really in
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.840]  kind of a mob and let's just say it he's white it's mainly immigrants and in
[04:36.840 --> 04:42.360]  non-white surrounding and and I've got friends at UT they're going back to get

[04:46.200 --> 04:50.640]  class and told you are evil by the white professor and all the minorities and
[04:50.640 --> 04:54.200]  they say it doesn't matter what you do you're white it's evil I mean this is

[08:57.520 --> 09:03.320]  terrifying report it was almost as if it were a planned infusion it's just pancake

[09:47.520 --> 09:55.880]  him so much my sister-in-law when you are subverting the power of government
[09:55.880 --> 09:59.800]  that that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy what do you think
[09:59.800 --> 10:04.080]  of Edward Southern I think he's a traitor Obama is the one that kills the
[10:04.080 --> 10:07.600]  US troops if the Russians bomb any of them Obama is the one that put them in
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.680]  arms way Obama is the one using them as human shields it is the most corrupt
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.000]  degenerate criminal government in American history I'm here to warn people
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.200]  you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game

[10:29.360 --> 10:32.400]  building right now we're armed to the teeth and we're not scared you got that
[10:32.400 --> 10:37.480]  you sons of bitches in 2012 your agency was saying quote the Salafists the
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.280]  Muslim Brotherhood and al Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.280]  insurgents in Syrian in 2012 the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.640]  those same groups why did you not stop that why didn't you come forward before
[10:49.640 --> 11:00.440]  what were you waiting for well for you inspector I needed you
[11:00.440 --> 11:08.520]  I suddenly have this feeling that everything was connected we're all part of it
[11:10.040 --> 11:18.920]  are we ready for it from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[11:18.920 --> 11:26.040]  ladies and gentlemen big things are happening obviously here in the United
[11:26.040 --> 11:31.160]  States and around the world thank you so much for joining us today we do have
[11:31.160 --> 11:36.480]  two guests Phyllis Schlafly founder of the Eagle Forum will break down what's
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.080]  happening to Western borders and how to stop the globalist takeover then Roger
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.120]  Stone who has written a new book dealing with the fact that the Clintons have had
[11:47.120 --> 11:54.880]  a war on women will be joining us he is a historian so that is coming up today
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.000]  headline political strategist Hillary Clinton is an abuser of women and
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.960]  girls he will be in studio with us of course you've heard Hillary and her
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.560]  surrogates come out and say that Bernie Sanders is a sexist because
[12:08.560 --> 12:15.720]  criticizing a woman is sexist if a woman tries to sell you a car and you don't
[12:15.720 --> 12:19.720]  buy it you're sexist if you don't do it a woman tells you randomly you're sexist
[12:19.720 --> 12:23.880]  if you don't accept Obamacare you're racist this is the drum the politically
[12:23.880 --> 12:30.200]  correct beat and it's nothing but pack mentality herd mentality gang mentality
[12:30.200 --> 12:36.640]  and that's how they control populations well China tested an anti-satellite
[12:36.640 --> 12:43.880]  missile a few days ago and then magically we now see a major missile tested
[12:43.880 --> 12:50.120]  yesterday off the coast of Los Angeles scaring the population there why did the
[12:50.120 --> 12:55.640]  US launch a nuclear missile that would be visible from LA without any warning is
[12:55.640 --> 13:02.120]  the question we'll be looking at that yeah then it ties into economic news the
[13:02.120 --> 13:05.560]  Chinese are moving and accelerating their dumping of US treasuries and the
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.080]  dollar and letting the yawn basically compete directly with things like the
[13:12.080 --> 13:18.920]  Swiss Frank which is seen as a move to begin the toppling of the dollar and
[13:18.920 --> 13:25.360]  that ties in to Puerto Rico preparing to go into bankruptcy in their latest
[13:25.360 --> 13:31.160]  filings Puerto Rico government is developing a bank development plan and
[13:31.160 --> 13:38.240]  is saying that they're at risk for receivership and they're talking about
[13:38.240 --> 13:46.960]  cutting massive services to the public that's Bloomberg NBC ABC news those three
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.920]  articles we then have the S&P 500 dropping most of a month after rising to
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.520]  three months high emerging currency slide as dollar resumes advance and you
[13:58.520 --> 14:02.440]  see as as there's attempts to move away from the dollar more people will pour
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.440]  into the dollar in an attempt to prop it up because if it goes under there's
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.880]  going to just be devastating economic responses continuing with economic news
[14:12.880 --> 14:21.640]  homelessness in Hawaii grows defying image of paradise and reports like this
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.400]  actors aren't going to be real they're going to be inside a computer Marlon
[14:25.400 --> 14:30.520]  Brando's eerie premonitions from beyond the grave but you read the CNN article
[14:30.520 --> 14:34.200]  he was actually talking to top Hollywood people in the last years of his life who
[14:34.200 --> 14:39.000]  said this was the plan so it's not really premonitions it's the fact that he was
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.640]  on the inside also the Pentagon is covering up massive gay rape because
[14:44.640 --> 14:51.360]  gay rape is 15 times higher than the Pentagon had their own report in a new
[14:51.360 --> 14:56.600]  American psychological association study that was done and yes the military
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.280]  is now more and more filled with gang mentality prison mentality because
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.040]  they've allowed that to be recruited into it when he think goes on in
[15:04.040 --> 15:10.520]  prisons but because it's gay it's okay if your 18 year old son gets raped by 10
[15:10.520 --> 15:16.720]  guys in the army till he's bleeding it's okay because it's liberal it's it's
[15:16.720 --> 15:23.000]  beautiful it's bold it's it's it's it's full of courage what is it we're supposed
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.160]  to say about Caitlyn Jenner stunning and brave so it's stunning and brave
[15:30.160 --> 15:35.400]  because it's politically correct you see that's that's how that works so that's
[15:35.400 --> 15:38.280]  some of the news and then of course this huge news that ties into the military
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.600]  news the London Express Britain names Russia as major national security threat
[15:43.600 --> 15:47.240]  on par with ISIS the United States has come out and said Russia is the biggest
[15:47.240 --> 15:52.480]  threat but while England says about bigger than ISIS a group they helped
[15:52.480 --> 15:59.160]  openly create and that ties in with this article European Commission attack on
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.840]  drudge and the hyperlink and we know it's in the TPP that's meant to be
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.640]  ratified globally into UN law this December in Paris and they admit ahead
[16:08.640 --> 16:14.200]  of the Paris meeting they've proposed a new EU law put simple act of linking to
[16:14.200 --> 16:20.040]  content under copyright protection so ending free speech oh here's another
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.760]  Putin article the defense secretary suggests Putin might new America says
[16:24.760 --> 16:29.960]  US will defend international order as the people that have hijacked our country
[16:29.960 --> 16:35.840]  create disorder and that ties into this report German town migrants riot in
[16:35.840 --> 16:42.040]  church steal from stores defecate on gardens well they should charge you
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.960]  for doing that that's fertilizing residents who criticize behavior of
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.920]  asylum seekers label Nazi some find some arrested that's an info wars comm
[16:50.920 --> 16:55.440]  article linking to German newspapers linked on drugs report calm and that
[16:55.440 --> 17:01.440]  ties into this story patriarch of Antioch Muslims to conquer Europe with
[17:01.440 --> 17:09.680]  religion and procreation that's what the presidential front runner LePen said a
[17:09.680 --> 17:12.560]  month ago when she got arrested and indicted she basically said those exact
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.920]  words Wisconsin Dems moved to ban most semi-auto firearms that's from guns
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.680]  dot com told you that was coming Catalonia's parliament backs declaration
[17:22.680 --> 17:27.200]  of split from Spain almost every house I saw when I was in Barcelona that's
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.680]  pretty much the capital of Catalonia a beautiful place great people it wants to
[17:31.680 --> 17:37.040]  get away from the EU and Spain itself violent shaking along the ring of fire
[17:37.040 --> 17:43.320]  continues a progression of disasters that began in September we're gonna look
[17:43.320 --> 17:48.280]  at that as well but speaking of a progression of disasters when we return
[17:48.280 --> 17:55.200]  I spent a few minutes on this yesterday but it's so important and so enlightening
[17:55.200 --> 18:02.400]  so informative so illustrative that we're going to go over again and tie it
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.000]  into the University of Missouri president resigns over race complaints he
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  apologized he said he'd do better he said he was basically the university was
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.600]  just horrible and he promised that he'd do everything he could of course that
[18:17.600 --> 18:20.720]  only encouraged all the political correctness and folks said you must resign
[18:20.720 --> 18:27.200]  so he has resigned in another act of just mob mentality and what did he
[18:27.200 --> 18:33.200]  apologize for why I was reading CNN trying to squeeze blood out of a stone
[18:33.200 --> 18:42.640]  figuratively people claim that once they heard someone in a dorm make a racial
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.560]  comment who was drunk a white person and somebody did a design that looked like
[18:48.560 --> 18:54.120]  a swastika on a poster once well yeah nine times out of ten or more often than
[18:54.120 --> 18:57.320]  that I think it's like nine nine percent times put it this way I haven't heard of
[18:57.320 --> 19:08.400]  a swastika being painted on a dorm door or put on a black or Jewish facility at
[19:08.400 --> 19:13.920]  a college where it wasn't fake now I have seen some real cross-burning usually
[19:13.920 --> 19:20.040]  that staged as well false flags some of which had wound drama cleaning but but
[19:20.040 --> 19:22.600]  this is what the culture is about and people that tune into mainstream media
[19:22.600 --> 19:26.880]  really believe they're being advanced in society getting into these politically
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.000]  correct cults we're gonna break this down because the the president has now
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.120]  resigned and watch that's not gonna be enough and that ties into the Yale
[19:36.120 --> 19:40.200]  students finding the husband another professor of the head professor over the
[19:40.200 --> 19:46.360]  student affairs and they confront him that his wife put out an email saying

[20:25.160 --> 20:29.760]  collapse before that I warned that dot-com companies would crash and they
[20:29.760 --> 20:34.880]  did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to

[24:25.140 --> 24:32.140]  host Alex Jones this morning I was in the local gym it was a personal trainer
[24:32.140 --> 24:37.420]  there a lady training a middle-aged fellow and he kept staring at me and he
[24:37.420 --> 24:41.760]  kept staring at me wherever I was in the gym and I don't really care I just
[24:41.760 --> 24:51.640]  ignore that and then I was over on some cable machines and the lady kind of
[24:51.640 --> 24:55.840]  comes over with him and the gym is pretty much wide open a lot of people
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.240]  there and there's other machines and I was on this one first I've been on there
[25:00.240 --> 25:07.400]  about 30 seconds and they said I guess you can use that but I'm gonna
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.240]  want it in a minute which is not normal etiquette you just go over and say hey
[25:10.240 --> 25:14.640]  can I use that of course here and I said sure actually I'm done with it you
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.480]  can have it now they went oh no we don't want it now so as I walked away they
[25:19.480 --> 25:24.680]  go yeah that right winger Alex Jones man he's crazy and I knew when he was
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.960]  staring at me and she was looking at me and kind of giggling and laughing that
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.960]  they were totalitarians that think they're liberal so I turned back and I
[25:32.960 --> 25:39.040]  said you know who's causing problems in this country it's the new left they're
[25:39.040 --> 25:44.520]  nothing but the totalitarians I said I'm a liberal you're not you people are
[25:44.520 --> 25:48.760]  bullies you people have serious problems
[25:52.240 --> 25:57.240]  but it was like in a movie where I then snapped in my mind and realized that I
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.840]  didn't actually say that to him I was thinking that see I've gotten to the
[26:01.840 --> 26:07.960]  point where I can control myself and not say it and just walk away because
[26:07.960 --> 26:16.320]  you're not gonna help people like that in most cases they are all about the
[26:16.320 --> 26:24.760]  group there but they said that to me and laughed at me as if in their peer
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.520]  pressure world of being so insecure I care but that's the totalitarianism of
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.800]  these people and every day we get more and more insane examples where you can't
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.520]  say mother or father and they teach the kids he or she your boy or girl is bad
[26:38.520 --> 26:43.000]  and your purple penguins and being heterosexual is hateful being white is
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.080]  hateful this is cultural disintegration by design from protesting Vietnam to
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.240]  demanding safe places what happened to America's college kids
[26:57.240 --> 27:07.080]  New York Times Yale's Halloween advice stokes a racially charged debate and
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.160]  they act like this bizarre video that we began airing on last Friday that
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.560]  they're now covering I love how the mainstream media has to follow the real
[27:15.560 --> 27:22.320]  media the dinosaur media has to follow the mammal media I guess you call us
[27:22.320 --> 27:33.520]  but they sit there and act like it's normal the video because Yale the
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.720]  student affairs head was getting complained at and been told to put out
[27:38.720 --> 27:44.520]  reports that Halloween was banned or costume parties were banned even for
[27:44.520 --> 27:50.040]  private fraternities as many colleges have done they've just said there will
[27:50.040 --> 27:56.760]  be no Mexican food parties at universities all over and they say but we
[27:56.760 --> 28:02.000]  like to have a Spanish style Mexican style deal with enchiladas and tequila
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.720]  and beer pool parties those are very popular and they say well someone might
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.200]  be hurt well you know I had Mexican food last night at home and boy was it
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.160]  good I wasn't eating it because I was racist but obviously that's not what's
[28:14.160 --> 28:20.200]  going on I mean I've been to parties where you wear some bear rows and get
[28:20.200 --> 28:23.080]  falling down drunk but there's nothing to do with that it's just it's just that
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.200]  it's okay do we do a Greek style a Japanese style do we dress up like
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.160]  barbarians it's just something fun but they turn it into that to end culture to
[28:33.160 --> 28:43.080]  end debate to end discussion and I know you know that I understand that you are
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.040]  aware of that but the young people in the high schools the elementary schools
[28:48.040 --> 28:53.080]  in the colleges they're not when we come back from break I'm going to play the
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.400]  video that we got to Friday and last night on the Sunday show then I'm gonna
[28:56.400 --> 29:01.480]  get to the new videos of the president resigning and more and CNN again with a
[29:01.480 --> 29:06.900]  straight face reporting on it like it's all very reasonable people with bull
[29:06.900 --> 29:14.880]  horns and huge rallies to fight the racism that I'll guarantee you is one
[29:14.880 --> 29:18.240]  one-hundredth what their grandparents went through and I will also on the
[29:18.240 --> 29:22.280]  other side assure you there is plenty of racial slurs and stuff going back from
[29:22.280 --> 29:30.480]  the minorities towards the devil people also known as the whites so this is
[29:30.480 --> 29:34.240]  scientifically being carried out to the point that we're gonna play video and
[29:34.240 --> 29:40.760]  audio coming up of students streaking and screaming and fear saying how dare
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.600]  you allow there to be costume parties at Yale this is what one of our greatest
[29:44.600 --> 29:49.680]  universe for these turns out is addled brainwashed zombies are on the march the
[29:49.680 --> 29:56.680]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.040 --> 30:02.480]  manmade climate change is largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare the
[30:02.480 --> 30:06.160]  public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly stop global
[30:06.160 --> 30:09.240]  warming warming is a manufactured problem played up by the government to
[30:09.240 --> 30:12.960]  instigate a public reaction in this case fear the government then exploits to
[30:12.960 --> 30:16.160]  offer a predetermined solution to expansion of government at the public
[30:16.160 --> 30:19.760]  expense the strategy now known as the Hegelian dialectic has been used
[30:19.760 --> 30:22.840]  successfully by politicians for millennia to expand government which can
[30:22.840 --> 30:26.120]  only grow at the expense of individual liberties the Bush administration uses
[30:26.120 --> 30:29.760]  strategy successfully in 2003 when it gained enough public support for the
[30:29.760 --> 30:33.200]  invasion of Iraq by claiming country had weapons of mass destruction and the
[30:33.200 --> 30:36.480]  war ultimately expanded the military industrial complex in America's
[30:36.480 --> 30:39.600]  emerging police state today global warming is used as a boogeyman because
[30:39.600 --> 30:42.960]  allows the UN to use government funded scientists to scare the public into
[30:42.960 --> 30:46.080]  believing that manmade climate change is too big of a threat for their country
[30:46.080 --> 30:49.200]  to handle alone and thus it's can only be defeated through the expansion of the
[30:49.200 --> 30:52.200]  UN at the expense of their nation's sovereignty the number one goal of an
[30:52.200 --> 30:54.920]  out-of-control government is not to protect you but rather to gain more

[34:12.200 --> 34:17.720]  keep you in line and to be cultural Marxist again Atlantic Monthly a few weeks ago wrote
[34:17.720 --> 34:23.440]  a 28-page article the coddling of the American mind the name of emotional well-being college
[34:23.440 --> 34:29.200]  students are increasingly demanding protection from words and ideas they don't like here's
[34:29.200 --> 34:38.240]  what the is happening here's why that's disastrous for education and mental health and the article
[34:38.240 --> 34:45.320]  acts like it's just magically happening all over the place it's just coming out of nowhere
[34:45.320 --> 34:51.000]  from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany this is admittedly in textbooks
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.960]  at PhD level on how to scramble civilization and again Jerry Seinfeld and all these other
[34:58.960 --> 35:05.440]  top comedians won't go perform at universities because the crowd will find something to be
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.840]  offended by because that's all they know how to do that's what their education is that's
[35:10.840 --> 35:19.600]  what their identity is there are always gangs and groups and manipulators and clicks from
[35:19.600 --> 35:25.040]  the country club to the inner city and you know who's successful the people that ignore
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.280]  it move forward build their own lives build their own worlds and don't care what all of
[35:31.280 --> 35:37.360]  the clicks say and do when you really don't care about clicks anymore they will kiss your
[35:37.360 --> 35:42.280]  rear end like nothing you've ever seen to get you to join their click and the real pleasure
[35:42.280 --> 35:49.040]  is you don't want to join their click and then open society true open society opens
[35:49.040 --> 35:54.960]  up to you and free association once people in society know that you're really a cool
[35:54.960 --> 36:01.320]  person and you get to start associating with the creme dollar creme of the world the true
[36:01.320 --> 36:08.080]  intellectuals the true trailblazers the people that other thinkers admire the type of people
[36:08.080 --> 36:14.440]  that admire you because you're free and open-minded and they know that you admire them it's a society
[36:14.440 --> 36:21.560]  based on building people up not tearing them down and the controlled left wants to act
[36:21.560 --> 36:31.000]  like that's something that they're doing they want to behave like they are the renaissance
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  no they are destroying the renaissance so that said let me start getting to these clips
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.360]  this is a hard clip to listen to and it goes on for a long time not going to play the whole
[36:40.360 --> 36:51.000]  thing but it is a professor whose wife is the head of student affairs associate master

[37:11.320 --> 37:17.280]  article i've read it and it's very just a friendly email hey we're about free expression
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.760]  here if people are having a party a private party or walking around campus in a costume
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.800]  and you're offended just look away you know it's part of people's right of expression
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.900]  to wear whatever costume they want or just dress however they want and this is with the
[37:31.900 --> 37:41.280]  calls for her to ban halloween parties and so she explains we can't do that well they
[37:41.280 --> 37:49.240]  catch her husband another professor out walking around in the commons and remember the new
[37:49.240 --> 37:54.560]  york times is an article out today reporting on this like it's normal oh there's a big
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.240]  controversy what do you think they wouldn't ban halloween or wouldn't ban costumes and
[38:00.240 --> 38:06.160]  so people want them fired and that's what they scream and yell we don't feel safe everyone's
[38:06.160 --> 38:17.120]  going to leave the university now the president of Yale has been deeply troubled by a meeting
[38:17.120 --> 38:23.800]  of students of color who were quote in great distress last week because they didn't believe
[38:23.800 --> 38:33.080]  that the university they were attending was giving the needs that minorities needed quote
[38:33.080 --> 38:37.880]  they're in great distress many said they did not believe the university was attuned to
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.960]  the need of minority students i've been paraphrasing from reading the article they just put it up
[38:42.960 --> 38:49.440]  on screen for me i'm doing pretty good for pair paraphrasing and so with a straight face
[38:49.440 --> 38:54.880]  they then report on the hysteria and you have to understand these are desperate people having
[38:54.880 --> 39:00.920]  panic attacks and Atlantic monthly would have you believe this just magically happened on
[39:00.920 --> 39:08.240]  its own and the image they use for the article is a three-year-old in a college student chair
[39:08.240 --> 39:15.640]  with an apple computer and that's what these people are arrested development fried individuals
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.800]  and if you use words bigger than them or if you disagree with them if you even tell them
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.880]  i love you i want to empower you you're being socially conditioned this is a form of cult
[39:25.880 --> 39:31.320]  programming they will begin shrieking and yelling and flipping out you've seen our man on the
[39:31.320 --> 39:36.560]  street videos i'm sorry our person on the street videos let me use proper mind control
[39:36.560 --> 39:42.880]  terms you see them say hey for obama we're gonna put gun owners in forced labor camps
[39:42.880 --> 39:46.680]  absolutely i'm sick of these owners so we're going to put them in prison for owning guns
[39:46.680 --> 39:53.440]  yes well here please sign right here nine out of ten let's have forced abortions of
[39:53.440 --> 39:59.320]  christians nine out of ten sign it let's arrest christians nine out of ten sign it if you
[39:59.320 --> 40:06.040]  say for obama let's bring in world government let's get rid of the bill of rights of constitution
[40:06.040 --> 40:14.120]  for obama let's ban criticizing obama nine out of ten every time sign it you've seen
[40:14.120 --> 40:18.720]  us play the videos drudge is linked to accountless times it happens in austin it happens in new
[40:18.720 --> 40:24.320]  york it happens in la it happens where all these quote ultra educated people are who
[40:24.320 --> 40:30.520]  think they have joined the most elite groups on the planet because they go to a university
[40:30.520 --> 40:37.320]  and all they do is run around and scream at people all day that they've been offended
[40:37.320 --> 40:43.240]  i had two people on halloween as i went to my cousin's birthday party come up to me and
[40:43.240 --> 40:51.520]  say are you a nazi and i'd laugh and say no they'd say well i'm offended by your hat i'm
[40:51.520 --> 40:57.080]  jewish and the guy was clearly looked like he was as Arab as they come i said are you
[40:57.080 --> 41:04.680]  joking he said no and i saw i went off on it and then as i said i had another person
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.960]  come up to me and do the same thing and then i started talking to other people and they
[41:09.960 --> 41:14.800]  said no it was going on everywhere or if you weren't wearing a costume and this wasn't
[41:14.800 --> 41:20.600]  just at his party he had another party after it the light and i went at a top floor of
[41:20.600 --> 41:26.560]  a bar and club it was open to the public though and there were just people walking around
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.160]  giggling i have white guilt i can't believe we're wearing these outfits it may be hurting
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.160]  someone's feelings and my buddy pat riley heard this from some woman and then i was
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.680]  talking to somebody else that another man was walking around saying it and then you
[41:37.680 --> 41:46.880]  realize oh my gosh we're in a cult folks these people are brain fried you've got hispanics
[41:46.880 --> 41:54.080]  blacks asians whites everybody probably 400 people on the top of a club outside with a
[41:54.080 --> 41:59.760]  dj my cousin brought in and he's dj'ing as well everybody's having a great time except
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.640]  for a handful of people walking around bugging everyone socially but that's what they socially
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.240]  know how to do is walk over and then try to make you uncomfortable and have you submit
[42:11.240 --> 42:16.960]  to them in some raw act of power now individually they're nobody's but they get together in giant
[42:16.960 --> 42:25.600]  hordes led by white guilt operatives that will then go out funded by soros and actually
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.920]  chant deck the halls with dead cops fall a lot of law a lot of law because the more extreme
[42:30.920 --> 42:37.720]  the better because again it's social disruption that's being funded by the globalist openly
[42:37.720 --> 42:43.240]  so let's go to the clip because it just illustrates everything where she begins screaming and yelling
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.120]  he says well my vision is not you know obviously your vision and I disagree with you so she
[42:47.120 --> 42:53.120]  screams shut up and then jumps into a space like she's gonna hit him and then her boyfriend
[42:53.120 --> 42:58.040]  starts agreeing with her because the man only is allowed this is taught in university now
[42:58.040 --> 43:03.720]  to agree with a woman after she is in the dominant position she has the authority then you second
[43:03.720 --> 43:10.760]  her and you see people standing around nodding with her nodding they're under attack people
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.960]  are trying to get them they want halloween band folks if they a lot of christians send
[43:15.960 --> 43:20.840]  me emails going why are you defending halloween I thought you said it's an occult holiday
[43:20.840 --> 43:25.640]  for most people it isn't and it's harmless I'm gonna get this back out of my eye but
[43:25.640 --> 43:29.800]  you can get the beam out of yours you know what I mean clearly it goes back to Sam Haynes
[43:29.800 --> 43:36.720]  show and the occult the druids I know that the point is if they can ban anything they
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.960]  can ban everything if they can ban probably the most popular holiday in America that is
[43:41.960 --> 43:49.840]  the most inclusive and across the board notice they don't want vampires and ghouls band they
[43:49.840 --> 43:56.400]  want cowboys and geisha girls and mariachi bands and tarzan band they want cavemen outfits
[43:56.400 --> 44:03.520]  band they want to be able to control things and ban what they want and demand the university
[44:03.520 --> 44:11.360]  president resign as he just did we're gonna get to that
[44:11.360 --> 44:20.280]  because he dared not resign because two complaints were filed by two police the last few years
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.160]  that at parties someone heard a racial tone from drunk people in both cases and someone
[44:26.160 --> 44:33.000]  saw swastika once oh my gosh yeah like in the library I told you about the phenomenon
[44:33.000 --> 44:43.120]  of when we cover Nazis we see comments in on YouTube saying stop showing the swastika
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.000]  they call the history channel the Hitler channel not because it supports Hitler but because
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.520]  you know it started out showing world war two films that were open source so without
[44:52.520 --> 44:59.120]  further ado here is the abject hysteria the panic the fear that Atlantic monthly talks
[44:59.120 --> 45:07.320]  about where they go into panic attacks oh my gosh you he just called her a he or she just
[45:07.320 --> 45:15.160]  called you know somebody a she oh my gosh on the questionnaire it says he or she I'm hurt
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.120]  the word he or she hurts me I'm not included ban the word mother and father and you're
[45:19.120 --> 45:24.880]  like oh this is a joke it's not really happening it is happening all over the world it's cultural
[45:24.880 --> 45:30.800]  domination by a bunch of hissy fit throwing mental patients controlled by hardcore social
[45:30.800 --> 45:35.680]  engineers these people are illiterate you understand that they don't know how to navigate
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.920]  culture they don't know how to start a business they know how to run our lives and that's it
[45:40.920 --> 45:48.480]  and they will be put in charge of the bureaucracy over us do you understand they're coming for
[45:48.480 --> 45:55.480]  us here she is freaking out on the yelp professor
[45:55.480 --> 46:19.560]  you have not done that but sending out that email that goes against your position as masters
[46:19.560 --> 46:27.960]  you understand that no I don't agree with that can you accept the position I have a different
[46:27.960 --> 46:33.680]  vision step down if that is what you think about being a person step down it is not about
[46:33.680 --> 46:40.560]  pretty intellectual feet it is not you understand that you will step down a home here you are
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.880]  not doing that you're supposed to be an advocate you should be at that last day when you hear
[46:46.880 --> 46:51.880]  her say that she didn't know how to create a safe fit for a freshman in film it how do
[46:51.880 --> 46:57.880]  you explain that these freshmen probably think this is white gal is you hear that they're
[46:57.880 --> 47:05.880]  going to leave they're going to transfer because you are a poor student you should not sleep
[47:05.880 --> 47:11.640]  at night we're out we're out you're disgusting all right you should and folks they'll probably
[47:11.640 --> 47:18.560]  make them design because they said people have free speech we cannot ban costume parties
[47:18.560 --> 47:26.880]  they wanted them banned at private frats because it's so hurtful and Yale is now basically
[47:26.880 --> 47:32.240]  apologizing and saying they're deeply deserve deeply disturbed this is all part of the bullying
[47:32.240 --> 47:37.600]  we're so sorry you're scared of Halloween not of ghost and goblins but that someone
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.960]  might wear something that offends you this is basket case level but they're now meant
[47:41.960 --> 47:47.960]  to cater to it to encourage even more basket casing so these young people are such basket
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.800]  cases after 200 grand sucked out of them with a four or eight year degree that they're too
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.040]  upset with why they can't get a job they think they can't get a job because they're a quote
[47:58.040 --> 48:03.600]  minority or because they're white or whatever it is when in truth the economy was already
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.720]  dismantled is why so now we have the University of Missouri system president resigning just
[48:09.720 --> 48:18.080]  about an hour ago after he groveled and apologized and everything for phantoms of racism at the
[48:18.080 --> 48:24.320]  four campus system and this will only encourage this is what you send your kids to school
[48:24.320 --> 48:29.000]  for now to become young adults and to be arrested development and learn how to throw
[48:29.000 --> 48:35.000]  fits and be put into cultural Marxism and be totally entitled and be just complete jokes
[48:35.000 --> 48:46.560]  here is the CNN report acting like all this is reasonable students gathered at the University
[48:46.560 --> 48:52.680]  of Missouri this weekend to highlight complaints of racism on the overwhelmingly white campus
[48:52.680 --> 48:57.880]  now in a tweet posted by Missouri's Legion of Black Collegians more than two dozen football
[48:57.880 --> 49:03.480]  players have joined the calls for the university systems president to resign the players said
[49:03.480 --> 49:09.320]  they will not be part of any practice or game until he does so players met with their coaches
[49:09.320 --> 49:14.600]  on Sunday as the team canceled its scheduled practice most of them were tight lipped about
[49:14.600 --> 49:18.920]  the meeting and about the controversy I'm not allowed to comment on much so like I said
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.280]  we're just gonna all stay together the team and we all made this decision as a team to
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.840]  you know not talk to me so you're not gonna hear much from the players so Mizzou coach
[49:27.840 --> 49:33.080]  Gary Pinkle wrote online the Mizzou family stands as one posting this picture of the
[49:33.080 --> 49:38.480]  team the move comes after graduate student Jonathan Butler started a hunger strike last
[49:38.480 --> 49:44.520]  week he accuses the university's leadership of not doing enough to address racism on campus
[49:44.520 --> 49:49.600]  and push Mizzou in a positive direction so I'm in this because it's that serious we're
[49:49.600 --> 49:54.880]  dealing with humanity here and at this point we can't afford to continue to work with individuals
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.840]  who just don't care for their constituents University of Missouri system president Tim
[49:59.840 --> 50:05.600]  Wolfe issued a statement saying in part that he is dedicated to ongoing dialogue to address
[50:05.600 --> 50:11.480]  these very complex societal issues giving no sign that he intends to resign well he did
[50:11.480 --> 50:17.720]  resign Andrew Spencer reporting so that's the mass mental illness taking hold and there's
[50:17.720 --> 50:22.480]  also a selfishness to this is not a demonstration for Chinese slave laborers are not a demonstration
[50:22.480 --> 50:27.560]  for the million sex slaves estimated to be in the United States mainly from the third
[50:27.560 --> 50:34.360]  world there's never any demonstrating anything real or substantive there's just taking all
[50:34.360 --> 50:40.400]  the media hype and the MTV hype and projecting it with an exercise of power well thank God
[50:40.400 --> 50:46.080]  I won't be watching any college football anyways I'll be out living my life fighting the globalist
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.160]  trying to empower people but it just shows what you pay for with college when we come
[50:50.160 --> 50:56.760]  back and we'll have the president of the university resigning I kind of love watching
[50:56.760 --> 51:06.360]  this this is sick earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each
[51:06.360 --> 51:11.000]  of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.160]  do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the need for water but if
[51:15.160 --> 51:20.080]  you consider heat storage I'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things
[51:20.080 --> 51:25.160]  for you to consider how will I keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal
[51:25.160 --> 51:29.480]  or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it
[51:29.480 --> 51:34.440]  with you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[51:34.440 --> 51:39.040]  like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.160]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing

[55:12.080 --> 55:18.000]  president wolf resigning because they like i had to read like five or six articles
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.960]  when i saw this last night this morning finding out what happened and in the complaints
[55:24.960 --> 55:31.520]  in the last two years twice someone says they called the police claiming at a party they
[55:31.520 --> 55:38.480]  heard a racial slur from a drunk person two different people and then someone saw a group
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.440]  of symbols together that they thought might look like a swastika and then another time they tried
[55:43.440 --> 55:49.680]  to block the president's car he didn't stop and get out and now he's resigned and now
[55:49.680 --> 55:55.600]  Yale's president is apologizing for them not banning halloween and is saying they're very
[55:55.600 --> 56:03.760]  worried and very sorry that they didn't ban halloween so nicobe and some of the others
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.920]  have been talking about whoever wants to jump on the mic uh give me your take on this situation
[56:07.920 --> 56:11.520]  i mean this is imagine how this country is going to try to operate and compete with their
[56:11.520 --> 56:18.480]  countries when we have become this much of basket cases go ahead so uh i was out of the loop this
[56:18.480 --> 56:22.480]  weekend as far as the news is concerned and so i had to read three stories about this
[56:22.480 --> 56:27.360]  resignation and it wasn't until i got to the last article that i got a vague idea of why
[56:27.360 --> 56:32.720]  they were calling for him to resign and uh why he actually did it so the only things that i read
[56:32.720 --> 56:40.080]  were that uh he was silent on the michael brown Ferguson situation then he was surrounded in a
[56:40.080 --> 56:46.480]  parade uh and he didn't handle that correctly and then they asked him what uh institutionalized
[56:46.480 --> 56:49.920]  oppression stood for and they didn't like his definition and those are the only things that
[56:49.920 --> 56:54.480]  i read as far as why they were calling for him to resign sure and i'm just still really confused
[56:54.480 --> 56:59.360]  about the whole it just seems really ridiculous well and exactly and that's that's since the
[56:59.360 --> 57:04.560]  hunger strike started a few weeks ago they've now issued a list of demands for the university
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.600]  that looks like it was written by the southern primary law center or the ford foundation that's
[57:09.600 --> 57:12.880]  why you notice the students that are not allowed to talk about it because this is being handled
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.520]  as a way again to take over local governments take over universities by politically correct
[57:17.520 --> 57:23.600]  bullying this is cultural Marxism right out of Mao Zedong's uh red terror youth brigades
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.360]  i don't say that for political effect i mean that's what this is
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.120]  and then meanwhile they're supposed to turn universities into these racial infighting centers
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.040]  when not getting into it is what stops it being promoted that's why starbucks said and met with
[57:39.040 --> 57:44.000]  the white house we're going to talk about racism everybody that buys coffee it's meant to stir it
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.280]  up america's never been more together until obama came anybody else want to add a point to this
[57:50.400 --> 57:55.520]  just an update starbucks will no longer feature holiday cups they're going to be just read
[57:55.520 --> 58:00.240]  that's right that well they said that it's simplistic and won't offend anybody so now
[58:00.240 --> 58:05.920]  even christmas trees and stars uh on the cups might hurt somebody's feelings cj
[58:05.920 --> 58:12.640]  okay they heard i guess some nanny state court of public opinion people the same folks that are
[58:12.640 --> 58:18.880]  growing the professor that are growing the president well it's like germany's banning uh
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.000]  first they banned christmas festivals because they're hurtful now they're just getting ready
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.600]  to winter festivals so that's a good thing i guess because those are racist too um this is just
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.000]  incredible by the way we got to get you guys on air more you guys are on air so little you
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  didn't hardly have the mics close to you when we needed to get you guys on every hour because you

[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.720]  phyllis schlafly founder of the eagle forums joining us to break down open borders globalism
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:32.080]  what she thinks obama's going to try in his last year in office that's all coming up
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.960]  but i want to open the phones up in the next two segments specifically
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:44.080]  for college students who disagree with me or agree with me about political correctness
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.880]  being a weaponized system of course it is but that's admitted but you may have a different
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.600]  opinion because you're uninformed and i don't mean that sarcastically that's just a fact
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.560]  and i want to open the phones up for college students or college faculty anybody on a college
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.600]  to tell their stories of political correctness also if you're in public school or private
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.880]  school anybody in an education system basically in fact the military is an example where new
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.520]  recruits are made to wear red high heels to teach them cultural sensitivity for women
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.760]  well that's women's fault they want to wear high heels that are bad for their feet it's
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:29.760]  all part of pushing the envelope of bullying people culturally but a few weeks ago we had
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.680]  this top inventor on the show to talk about the new alexa pure pro water filtration system that
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:42.800]  we have exclusively discounted at infowarstore.com with free shipping and with 10 off of promo code
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.960]  water and i was just told today we're able to extend this for another week or so maybe longer
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:55.360]  by the manufacturer so i wanted to air this piece because talk about solutions cleaning up your water
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.640]  is where it all begins then we'll come back with open phones and the special reports stay with us
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:08.160]  break down why you're so proud of these filters well i mean this this the alexa pure is really
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:14.080]  a culmination of all of my experience it was posed to me as an extremely challenging project
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.400]  they wanted a product that would actually operate without any electricity so you had no pressure
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.320]  you had to do it all by gravity and they needed they really effectively said we need everything
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:33.520]  imaginable to be removed efficiently way higher than 99 percent and so the result was it was it's
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:40.080]  like a stream challenge worked on it for quite a long time and basically what we've done is we
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:47.200]  created a the only filter to my knowledge that hits all three it will remove effectively all the
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:55.680]  major metals all the major non-metals such as fluoride it will take out all known microbiological
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:02.240]  threats including viral bacterial and zest and it will take out organic chemicals of pretty
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.240]  much everything with without exception it's a very very powerful device i don't believe that
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.880]  there's anything else out there in the world that can do that especially under gravity flow conditions
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:18.480]  the fit and finish are fantastic no no compromise was made on the quality of the construction
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.720]  um so i mean it's really a remarkable achievement on their part and i feel very proud actually to
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.720]  be part of the team that put that together what's your view overall on fluoride well okay so we
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.440]  actually tested against both the fluoride ion and the fluorosilicate that you mentioned which
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.960]  is the additive that people put into water uh under federal control and basically we removed
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.880]  both them with equal efficiency so we wanted to be sure that no matter how fluoride is added to
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.000]  the water can be intercepted and removed um so that's how we've dealt with that all i can tell
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.960]  you is that we tested against all known fluoride chemicals that are added to water the new ones
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.160]  and the old ones and we remove them all of equal efficiency as your belief that this is the best
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.360]  gravity-fed filter of the design out there available to the public without a doubt i mean
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:13.920]  most of these gravity flow filters are at best uh simple particulate filters they remove dirt and
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.840]  debris sediment they're not going to be capable of intercepting a viral particle to the degree
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.400]  we're talking quantitative reduction below detection no one can touch that kind of capability
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:31.920]  well i'm impressed and i want to thank you so much for your time today it is the alexa pure pro family

[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:06.800]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.480]  the communists many times were able to take over countries by first hanging over the universities
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.480]  now in this case we've got big large offshore megabanks corporations that are using socialism
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.960]  and communism to domesticate the public because they themselves exempt themselves
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.240]  from the regulations and taxes and use the cultural marxism as a tool of political control
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:40.560]  but now we have the Missouri college system president tim wolf resigning and when you
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:48.560]  read the articles they never say anything he did he just didn't promote the black lives matter
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:54.880]  towards soros movement and this is just like democratic candidates like bernie sanders being
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.960]  booed off the stage and people saying he's racist and other democratic candidates saying hey all
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.920]  lives matter so they later apologize you're right all lives don't matter only black lives matter
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.800]  this is just part of the mental illness and then we watched the cnn report earlier it shows all
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.320]  these students just yelling and screaming running around at night in the park outside the university
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.560]  going i'm mad and then the Yale footage of the students just screaming at the professor going
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.880]  ban halloween it's hurtful i might see a scary costume i'm scared you need to lose your job
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:39.600]  actually you're doing that and then isn't it beautiful she poured drain oh in her eyes
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.520]  newscast going it's such courage that she had to pour drain oh in her eyes and be blind
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:52.960]  and now the taxpayer pays for her it's just whatever the weirdness is you've got to accept it
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.960]  and adopt it and now maybe you shouldn't have eyeballs at all it's hurtful that you do and she
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:06.480]  doesn't so let's go to the Missouri president here it is resigning i'm resigning as president
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.480]  of the university of Missouri system this is so funny my motivation in making this decision comes
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.600]  from love i love emu
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.240]  Columbia where i grew up this country is done
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.120]  i've thought and prayed about this decision it's the right thing to do you all committed to pull
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:38.160]  across students from concerns students 19050 to our grad students the football players and other
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.640]  students by the way there's they've now the frustration put out a list of demands or they won't
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:49.520]  come back and play but i see it's clear real so they're not gonna stop and i don't doubt it for
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:56.000]  a second hit hit plus i love it the whole time he's groveled there's discrimination it's clear
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.400]  it's present i don't doubt it i wanted to do something i'm not good enough i'm so sorry i resign i love
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.600]  it you're getting worthless degrees you're going nowhere you got fluoride in your water gmo
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.200]  cancer viruses and other stuff in your vaccines and the soros brainwashing that brought down ukraine
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:23.600]  you name it plays you like a fiddle and it's just a joke what a joke and then you get this little
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:30.720]  knock need president who groveled the whole time i'll do whatever you want you're right i'm sorry
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:37.120]  okay i resign now they'll probably sue him he could probably hang himself and they'd celebrate it
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.400]  because you can never go far enough in the hysteria in the mania
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:52.080]  katelin Jenner is stunning and brave period you clap for or you're a transphobic it's not that you
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.600]  think it's weird that the espn awards are being given to a freak with a wig on and you guys are
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:05.920]  freaks the Kardashians are all freaks you're gonna accept whatever culture they say this is the take
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.160]  down of this country and they're exporting this worldwide i want to go to your phone calls if
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.160]  you're a professor or if you're a student and if you've experienced political correctness or maybe
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:25.520]  you think it's a great idea i want to hear from you 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 now which clip we
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:33.840]  have lined up next there's so many yes let's go to the mark dice clip i i forgot about this one today
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.920]  where they go out and say they want a white privilege tax now he's done this before and
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:46.160]  almost everyone signs up this time it's from a quote fake msnbc report and they want to pay a white
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:52.960]  privilege tax because they're white even though 90 plus percent of whites have no connection
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:13:01.200]  even in their ancestors to slave owners as if your grandpa is a murderer or a child molester or a
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.400]  bank robber as if you got to serve time for him where did that authoritarian idea come from
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:12.160]  this is a new caste system let's go to part of this clip i'm going to play the whole report
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.480]  to demonstrate how most people will mindlessly believe what the mainstream media tells them
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:25.280]  i'm here posing as a reporter for msnbc where i'm going to be making up some insane news to see if
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:30.000]  the people blindly spread out almost are doing this president obama's new white privilege tax
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.040]  for income redistribution to invest money into minority communities think it's about time he
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.960]  do that yeah i think um yeah i think it's my turn for him to do that because you know i mean everybody
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:48.080]  need a little help you need a little handout and uh the minorities uh they're struggling and white
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.960]  people have more money you know so they the white privilege tax would just kind of even
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.840]  think even the playing field out a little bit you think yes yes it does yes i i really think so
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:04.640]  because uh they uh i love it i love it white people i love this this is so fun the rich that
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.840]  they have the money the white people have the money to um to put in the program to fund the
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.880]  programs we're putting them in in different organizations so the minority that's a good
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:20.320]  thing basically that's what you're saying and make sure the minority get the money to to benefit
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.760]  themselves from the white rights okay just checking the the idea is that since the white people make
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:32.240]  a disproportionately higher amount of money the white privilege tax would just sort of help to
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.800]  offset that right and make everything a little bit more even you think that's long overdue i guess
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.520]  so but you know at the end of the day it's a capitalist society so it's you know why penalize
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.720]  people for making more money per se but it's more of like a bonus right you know if you're if you're
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.520]  making that much money you're you're sort of rewarded with the white privilege no i i i get
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.720]  that for sure yeah it's it's almost you know uh just a good way to spread the wealth into the
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:05.440]  minority communities from the from the higher and white communities right about time we do something
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.280]  like that i'd say so i mean there's there's a lot i'd say millionaires with money in the bank that
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.920]  isn't right this is the full video is up on info wars dot com let's just stop right there yeah the
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.520]  billionaires are the ones pushing this they're not going to be paying it they're exempt the middle
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.200]  class regardless of what color you are will pay it and that's why it's disappearing now let's go back
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.480]  just to remember this is just a month ago and only played the first part of the report if you
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.880]  skip to the end of the report this is on national british television and it aired on television in
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:42.800]  the united states the courage of dumping drayno in your eyes and blinding yourself let's play a club
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:52.000]  of that here it is b i i d means that you have a need to be disabled in some way in my case it was
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.320]  a need to go blind nine years ago jule took the drastic decision to blind herself let's stop there
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.240]  want to go to phone calls but let's skip you out of the end of the report
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.120]  where because before only played part of them and then said that they were praising and people
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.840]  didn't believe me they have the report narrator praise it and they have all the people she talks to
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:18.640]  praise it because they're blind why shouldn't you be blind as if anybody i've ever heard of who's
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:28.480]  visually impaired would want other people to be blind no they want sight but it's taking every
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:35.840]  freakish behavior and putting on a pedestal like being offended that somebody has a name mom or dad
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:41.840]  husband and wife boy or girl he or she got to ban that too because if you're a he or she that hurts
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.320]  somebody who isn't well then the logic extends if you've got eyes and they don't or you've got
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.440]  working eyes and they don't you got to lose your sight here is the end of the report
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:58.880]  the drastic move that it's hard to encourage initially apprehensive jule has now told her friends
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:05.920]  in the blind community about how she took her own sight i told her that i didn't care that i think
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:13.520]  there's no resentment for her voluntarily taking her i said i that's not who i am i just don't
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.880]  think i've ever known anyone who had that condition i think there's a lot understood in the medical
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.360]  community but i'm sure that by what happened to you it will be helpful to somebody else hey jule
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:31.280]  how's it going oh hi y'all does this affect our friendship at all no actually i i want to thank
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.920]  you for sharing it with me i think it is it's a really inspiring story and now you've stepped in
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.040]  and now they'll teach your kids how to mutilate themselves and how to commit suicides to mutilation
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.480]  to the blind community and suicides all the way up in the schools because of death education this
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:54.480]  is what's being done scientifically nubs in Louisiana 50 year retired college uh ronnie
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.840]  attends university of texas let's talk about it brandon university of georgetown pc culture
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:08.000]  zaks a college grad on the pc culture uh who should we go to first uh let's go to uh brandon
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.680]  in fema region three brandon wants to talk about the georgetown pc culture how wondrous is it and
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:25.680]  when are you planning to pour drano in your eyes uh i don't know about all that uh the funny thing is
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.000]  is that i got out of the marine corps about two years ago and since i've rolled in georgetown
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.680]  about the same time last year and the mental illness of the political direction it's like
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:46.560]  you cannot make this stuff up i mean literally like two weeks ago the the director of or the
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:53.520]  sorry the deputy director of fema was giving kind of speaking engagement there and i walked in and i
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:59.440]  didn't see people clapping and you know this guy's telling you how great all these programs that fema
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.600]  setting up how amazing they are and if you say anything bad or disagree the campus police will
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:12.640]  arrest you or throw you out i mean i mean literally like when it oh yeah you're not allowed to disagree
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.360]  with them saying let's ban guns you're not allowed to disagree with with arresting people
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.320]  that are students there that hand out pocket constitutions you've got to submit to everything
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.400]  and that's why they go to the next level uh of saying we're going to teach your five-year-olds
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:35.120]  how to give oral sex because if they can do that they can do anything brother and um another thing
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:41.920]  someone was saying you know i don't really think 9 11 what we like this the anniversary was two
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.920]  months ago i don't think that the official story checked out and there were literally
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.120]  hordes of people screaming at him thought crime thought crime like it's something out of a movie
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:56.880]  like wait they actually use the term thought crime they saw thought crime you need to be arrested one
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.880]  there was a young female he said you need to be executed for committing a thought crime i mean
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.120]  well if i was as extreme as this sounds i've actually seen cases of things like this because
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.640]  they all one up each other and it's been pointed out that 1984 is now being used as an instruction
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:16.240]  manual you know hillary clinton says it's her favorite book i'm not kidding and and now it is a
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.360]  literal instruction manual of Stalinist oppression brandon thank you for the call
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.640]  let's go ahead and go to nub in louisiana you're on the air thanks for calling thanks alex thank you
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.440]  very much um i'm trying to get to it as fast as i can i'm 51 years old i work in drugs i graduated
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:39.440]  in 1982 um we're construction for 23 years um let me go back a little further i was born in
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.320]  64 i see you're 50 years old you uh returned to college and then now you've encountered it go ahead
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.720]  yes sir and um at at birth at three weeks of age i was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer on my left
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:58.240]  arm at seven weeks the arm was amputated i was sent home basically with 18 you know 18 months
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:04.400]  to live sent home my parents were told um do what you wish with him whatever but don't get the task
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.800]  he's not going to live so i've grown up my entire life not not expecting to have a much of a future
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.560]  so anyway um i went to work at 18 i worked in construction i got into the environmental
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.080]  abatement industry doing is you're a survivor you've worked hard but let me guess they all told
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.280]  you you were evil and entitled well it's getting to that today you know it's getting to that today
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:32.000]  now um i i have a lot most everyone who knows me knows me is no no one really knows my real name
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.520]  they know me it's not because i have one arm and i choose for that not to be an issue you're making
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:43.440]  it something fun you're conquering it by by by transmuting it uh into something that's fun i
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:49.440]  understand yes sir and then and then and then i was brought up raised by marine and uh can't
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.880]  never could if if you want to do something bad enough there's nothing you you cannot do you can
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.800]  do anything you want to do if you want to do that okay and never could but anyway i mean it's coming
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:04.880]  into school now and um like i said i've dealt with i've worked in construction 25 years we we have
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:12.240]  a few professors and one that i think of in particular so lady and she is she is the she is
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:22.400]  the epitome of the regurgitation of of liberal brainwashed um idiocy and um she's teaching
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:31.120]  environmental law and um for five semesters of setting classes with this lady as the instructor
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.920]  and anytime you try to bring up any maybe an odor i understand things that are going on in
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.880]  in uh today more so than most of the younger children and she is she's convinced that they're
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.960]  going to they're going to brainwash the the students they built a sustainable energy room
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:55.680]  a building or whatever and we're studying ergonomics so we go and they put us in this
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.400]  sustainable energy room that's you know all the solar panels and what have you
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.160]  um and she tells us all about how they've built this it's all totally sustainable and they're
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.400]  using their recycled cans and bottles and what have you and then she makes it a point to point out
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.920]  that there are cameras in every corner uh watching everything that you do that's right here you know
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.640]  so blah blah blah they're brainwashing the kids to get used to the cameras being there sure it's
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.720]  total total control they don't tell you it's all a big payoff to select corporations well she ought
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:32.320]  to be glad uh san francisco is now banning fireplaces it's official i have that the san francisco
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:37.120]  chronicle this is a total takeover of society god bless you nob anything else you want to tell
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:44.480]  yeah i do alex i'm i'm 51 years old without one arm um i recently started taking some of your
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.560]  products and you never you don't get a chance to get your your promotions in on your products
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.280]  i like i said i got one arm i grew up i play baseball football basketball and i buried the boot
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:01.440]  in my opponents uh the enemy i buried the boot rather rather deep you know but anyway i've torn
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.160]  my shoulder up on my right arm i basically destroyed my shoulder so i got interested in
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:11.840]  struck listening to dr group on the products what have you and i started taking the dna force i brought
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:17.120]  to my mom my mom's 75 years old she's had a replacement surgery she's had uh lung cancer
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:25.040]  i started her on the dna force and within a matter of about two weeks she got she called me she
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.760]  wanted to know what this was whatever she told me that she smoked cigarettes her entire life twice
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:36.960]  in her entire life she stopped smoking cigarettes and at that time she didn't have bruising just
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.520]  bruising she didn't even know why but she would just have bruises when she stopped smoking cigarettes
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.200]  the bruises went away well i got her the ball of dna force and within two weeks she probably
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.960]  wanted to know what was going on because she said she had not changed anything in her life except
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:58.560]  for taking the dna force and she had no bruises and she just felt far better but you know overall
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.760]  she just felt wonderful and she wanted to know what the dna force was well then i had been taking
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.240]  it all along i and then i listened in dr group i'm trying to my shoulder had gotten to the point
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:14.480]  where the reason i went back to college is because my shoulder had gotten so bad i had to change careers
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.960]  i couldn't continue doing the work i was doing so i was going to go into management so i just
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.480]  wanted to get a safety degree and go into the space back into construction and do safety um
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:32.080]  so i literally had to quit my job and go back to school to to be able to to begin another 25 year
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.840]  career anyway listen in dr group i decided to try a few of the other products like i got there
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:47.440]  all of oregano vitamin d the the winter sun um and the secret 12 um and and a few of the other
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.720]  things as well but i think those products were the ones that did it i was seeing my my my primary
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:26:01.120]  care physician um did an MRI on my shoulder and said that i have one ligament on my shoulder out of
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:07.840]  five that's intact the other four completely torn um he said he's seen one shoulder injury in his
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.560]  entire career that was as bad as nine and it was a car wreck and the guy's arm was completely ripped
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:17.840]  off but yet i'm still able to use my arm i do everything that i need to do but it just miserable
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:25.520]  pain um getting injections into the shoulder kind of nothing one bottle of the winter sun one bottle
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:32.320]  of the secret 12 and i've been taking a dna force for about four months or so and then all of oregano
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.440]  right now i can throw a baseball throw a flip ball i can remove my arm
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.960]  in emotions that i couldn't do for years well i really appreciate that testimony now i'm god
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.840]  bless you i've got to move to other callers uh because of the fda and stuff we cannot make
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:55.360]  claims and i don't make claims it's our most expensive product because one of the ingredients
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:03.440]  in it that's patented and it's organic it's got the bio coq 10 it's got the bio pqq it's got a
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.760]  bunch of stuff in it that's prescription in europe and other places and my big thing is when i started
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:15.920]  taking it nerves that had been cut like in my leg and my finger that was cut off in an accident
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.880]  the feeling came back and i cut the finger off i don't know like 12 years ago and it only had
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.760]  partial feeling i've been on dna force now about a year and a half and the feeling is completely back
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:33.120]  it it does have patented ingredients where you can actually say been proven to grow nerves back
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.000]  but but i'm not even going to say that just go research what's in it for yourself it's one of
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:48.320]  those products where the bottle what's in it cost us half the retail price okay so um you you don't
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.360]  see nutraceuticals like this really sold anywhere else they got really fancy expensive clinics
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:59.280]  where you go to medical doctors and get stuff like this um it's the big sleeper product it's
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:05.760]  expensive we've got products that are 14 dollars at info wars life dot com um you know we've got high
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.240]  quality stuff that we can get really inexpensive and it's you know 14 dollars when it's on sale
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.840]  19 dollars when it's not um couple products that are that low something like dna force
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:24.640]  if we sold it at cost it'd be about 75 dollars one ingredient alone is something like
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.960]  was it 12 13 thousand dollars a kilo and amongst the other stuff is suit mean i had to sign like
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.400]  huge corporate agreements would like miss you bc usa to get it because they make it here in the us
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.880]  but just just one of the ingredients i mean this is a real hardcore product but i mean we have to
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.280]  sit there on the phone with japanese scientists and deal with them and and go through all this stuff
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.440]  just to get it and it is available you know i just went off into a long plug and i got loaded

[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:15.600]  i even skipped the network break so uh it's kind of out of control here i have to quit doing that but
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.360]  x2 is a game changer it's not very expensive it's just truly pure iodine true nation i and i
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.240]  am the absorbable type a lot of folks have iodine problems or they have deficiencies and
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.880]  if you've got a deficiency in something and you finally take it it's like magic it's like having
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.680]  a deficiency in oxygen if you don't have it you die happens in a couple minutes well not having
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.280]  a deficiency you know if you have a deficiency in vitamin c or other things you don't take you a

[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:48.000]  phyllis schlafly of course is a constitutional lawyer best-selling author she founded eagle

[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:01.520]  and unfortunately most of what she warned of in some cases 45 50 years ago
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:10.080]  has now come true and now we see the bizarre political correctness with people dumping acid
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.840]  in their eyes having taxpayers pay for their blindness to sex changes of children outside
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:25.840]  the parental consent to university presidents resigning for no reason just as a sacrifice to
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.840]  political correctness we now see even atlantic monthly coming out and saying the coddling of
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:37.200]  the american mind and seinfeld admitting that his daughter's been turned into a basket case
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:44.320]  who thinks that men and women together is sexist this is the triumph of the brainwashing of the
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.960]  destruction of the american mind and the western mind the cover of the latest issue of the economist
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:59.520]  is praising angela merkel for how wonderful a job she's doing she's ending europe as we know it
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:06.480]  what is it in the controlled left that wants to suicide the west so bad as we see millions of
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:12.560]  radical jihadi's pouring into europe a new article out on that today that's up on drudge
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:19.600]  from info wars dot com german town migrants in church steal from stores defecate on gardens
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:26.160]  any criticism of it is responded to by arrests the state says they'll take your children if you
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:35.280]  criticize it i mean this is truly crazy town and it's only accelerating now and we'll also get
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:42.240]  her take on election two thousand and sixteen twenty sixteen uh mrs schlafly thank you so much for
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:47.680]  coming on with us well it's always good to join you la alex and if you think i can solve all those
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:55.280]  problems i really cannot sure but can you tell us what's at the core of the elites uh creating
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:03.440]  what i would call a giant cult of uh just panic stricken mental patients i mean even atlantic
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:09.840]  monthly and the coddling of the american mind admits that the left has created a a generation of
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:16.960]  mentally ill people well i think they didn't have a good education and what they're taught in the
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:24.160]  public schools is not helpful uh they ought to be taught a reading writing arithmetic uh they ought
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.680]  to be taught american history the way it really happened not the way the political correctness
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.240]  people wish it happened and uh i i think it's the ignorance of the young people
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.600]  that uh is the cause of a lot of the problems they don't know what's right or what's wrong
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.280]  i agree with you they're desperate they don't really have a future all they know how to do
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:53.840]  is have chips on their shoulders and walk around angry and upset yes and that's so unfortunate
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:59.280]  and of course i've just countered that uh 25 years ago with the feminist and if you wake up in the
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.720]  morning mad at the world and feel that you're not getting a good deal uh you're probably not
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:11.920]  getting a good deal because nobody wants you around and uh it's uh it's uh extremely unfortunate
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:18.080]  what's been done to our young people i really feel sorry for them uh they uh we live in the
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.680]  greatest country in the world the greatest amount of freedom the greatest amount of prosperity
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:30.880]  that's why everybody in the world wants to come here and uh they want to downplay it in fact
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:37.040]  obama wants doesn't want us to believe that we're exceptional and we are a very exceptional country
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:45.200]  which is the truth looking at political correctness do you think it's starting to peak or is this
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.960]  just the beginning of the madness even camille paglia uh came out last week and said all this
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:58.000]  worship of transgender transgender mania uh used the the surest sign of the imminent collapse of
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:05.760]  society was her paraphrase quote oh well it should be the imminent collapse of the nuttiness of the
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:14.480]  left because uh ordinary people can understand what they talk about when they talk about
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:23.600]  changing your gender it's so ridiculous and uh it's uh uh we we just have to teach our young
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.840]  people how to read so that they can read the great books that are written in the in the english
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:36.640]  language you know uh one of my best-selling books is called first reader and is for parents to teach
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:43.200]  their children to read like i did before i let them go to your school and uh because they don't
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.640]  teach them how to read in school and so they don't and they've completely distorted american history
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.000]  you know they wiped out great heroes like george washington hey blinkin and so forth
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:02.480]  and uh it's it's so it's so bad what's been done to our children i don't blame the children i blame
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:08.640]  the adults who did it to them well you're right george washington was a hero all over the world
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.320]  he was so incredible uh i mean it's more fantastical than any hollywood movie and notice there's no
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.800]  movies about george washington where he's a major character he's always a minor character uh this
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.080]  this caricature they have completely stolen our history it wasn't the west that ended slavery
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.600]  no now we invented it fellas i mean it's crazy how they they just lie about everything and of
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:41.840]  course oh we we didn't invent slavery as slavery was talked about in the bible uh slavery was a
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:48.000]  common in uh and it was the people in the in africa who sold their own people into slavery
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:54.960]  and uh we eventually abolished slavery which was one of the great achievements of our country
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:02.080]  absolutely well looking at the current getting into the suicide of the west pat
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.840]  Buchanan one of your uh temporary says written a lot about the fact this is deliberate suicide
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.640]  what does the left think they're going to do when a majority of radical islamists
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.600]  are in their town or city i mean they're already demanding that they capitulate
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:23.360]  to their culture and the left is doing it why would they want to throw out the magna carta throw
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:29.200]  out the renaissance throw out the great enlightenment in exchange for the most radical forms of islam
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:38.880]  uh well they're so islam islam agitators who are uh radicalizing a lot of the young people
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:45.200]  and that's where it's coming from they aren't coming uh at it through a logic or good common
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:53.360]  sense it's become because the islamists have these radicals who are trying to make converts
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.920]  and hate christians and uh we have we need to realize who the enemy is that's the great thing
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:06.960]  ronald reagan did he figured out the enemy was the soviet union and he built the anti-missile
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:15.200]  defense he built the kind of a military uh that could be first in the world and we do believe in
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:22.080]  a military superiority because so when we are at the top of the heap uh everybody's safer
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:28.800]  for the uh the people who are our friends feel more comfortable and safe and the people who are
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.160]  enemies are scared to move against us and that's the way it ought to be well i do agree that america
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.160]  should be able to defend itself my problem is then that superiority has been abused uh and under
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.880]  obama look at more countries invaded than even bush and i know you were critical of some of that i
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.720]  mean this is this is just wild to see him cozied up to the radical muslim brotherhood and the rest
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.800]  of it but listen i want to give you the floor with limited time we have uh because i know you
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.760]  wanted to get into open borders where that's going what you think obama is going to do in his last
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:05.280]  year in office and of course election 2016 Germany is going and germany is going to disappear from
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:11.280]  the map because they're taking in more of these muslim immigrants that they have their own people
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:18.800]  and we shouldn't do that we uh we should stick by the rules of letting people in we used to only
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.160]  let people in if they signed a paper saying they were able to support themselves nowadays they come
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:31.840]  right in and go right on our welfare system and uh they don't speak our language and i know i had
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:38.080]  friends who when they arrived on the shore shores of ellis island their mother or father would stand
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:43.200]  them up and say now we're in america we're going to be americans we're going to speak english and
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:51.600]  this is our country and the people come today uh they don't feel that way and that's because they
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.400]  want a system of a bunch of vulcanized groups to play off against each other they are handicapping
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:05.200]  these young people so desperately but if you teach them how to read they'll be able to read
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.640]  some of the great books that are written in the english language that talked about the principle
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:16.240]  of limited government and why freedom is important and important to work for
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:26.160]  well you've been fighting this fight for over 50 years um but but my fight is a good example to the
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:33.520]  grassroots that you can win against overwhelming odds and you know i have a dvd called doing the
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.600]  impossible and which i show all the odds that were against me when i started the fight against the
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.920]  equal rights amendment everybody was against the press against me the president the congress the the
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:52.640]  press uh everybody you could think of everybody who was important the organization and so for it
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:44:01.440]  and uh now uh people haven't got any fight in it i don't know what the problem is i'll tell you the
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:06.720]  problem we are the richest nation probably the world's ever seen per capita our poorest people
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:12.160]  are more wealthy with shelter and medicine than kings of old and so biologically we're meant to
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:17.920]  be fat dumb and happy when we've got plenty of food so our culture our liberty our freedom
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.480]  our currency everything's being debased and destroyed but because we're still got plenty of
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:29.040]  beer and plenty of food and plenty of entertainment we are mesmerized as we basically have our
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:36.400]  throats collectively slip i think you said that very well i agree with you and it's a it's terribly
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:42.000]  sad but there's no question but that we are the greatest country in the world and we need to restore
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.600]  it and uh my my lesson is if a bunch of women could take on the fight against the equal rights
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:56.160]  amendment when everybody was against us from president congress organizations media on down
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:01.680]  uh we can take on some of these big problems and beat them because we do have truth on our side
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.320]  well as you know all the polls show that abortions were unpopular than ever since it was legalized
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:12.960]  in 73 uh guns are more popular than the last hundred years the culture of true libertarian
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:19.440]  constitutional classical liberalism uh used winning over the fake fascist liberalism i don't
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.720]  think they deserve to be called liberals i know that's the term they're known by they don't
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:28.560]  they don't no they don't they're actually they're socialists and there's a new book out
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:36.320]  and which tells the story of where all this started and uh they're really the first people
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.680]  who were after it wanted to make us socialists and they felt making us dumb and illiterate
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.280]  was the best route to that well there's still a paradox as you know again fellow schlafly
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:52.960]  constitutional lawyer john joins us a true uh a feminine trailblazer i wouldn't call her a feminist
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:58.080]  because that's a controlled term but but but you're certainly what what what gloria steinham
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:03.120]  would you know claim to love to be an actual powerful woman affecting change doing on her own
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.840]  having a huge effect i mean you're obviously for women being able to be trained and armed themselves
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:11.840]  i don't get why the so-called establishment feminists don't want women to have the right
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:18.320]  to defend themselves isn't that a basic uh right of women especially of course it is and and and you
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.240]  know i worked my way through college testing 30 and 50 caliber ammunition so i'm not afraid of guns
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:32.640]  in any possible way wow 50 cal i love that yeah they have a big kick oh i'm gonna have to photoshop
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.880]  a uh image of you with a 50 cal or if you've got a photo of that we'd love to put it out
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:42.880]  oh i don't know people people didn't run around with their cell phones in those days taking pictures
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.120]  no i know but that's awesome so so so yeah you know a 50 bmg it's got quite a kick huh
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:55.600]  yes it has a big kick so are you testing those for what the bombers or for ground troops uh i i
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:04.480]  tested for the ammunition yeah and uh and for example in those days uh our fighters our fighter
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:10.960]  planes shot their bullets through this through the propeller yes so they had to have a regular
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:19.120]  cadence uh of both of the bullet coming out of the uh gun in order that it wouldn't hit the
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.520]  propeller itself sure the nose gun when you pull the trigger the it would shoot in between the
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:33.600]  propellers that's correct and uh so that's that's what we tested for well like even more now that's
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.320]  awesome so you they you'd you'd go out there and test the ammo what with a single shot system
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:44.800]  yeah they were single shots but it was safe it was no i know that kicks even harder though
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.440]  i've got a single shot 50 cal that'll just knock your shoulder off yes it will and i
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:57.120]  hand fire the the barrett this as well but i tell you that's that's i don't know any other women out
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.440]  there that are doing that so good job but congratulations shifting gears into election
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:11.200]  2016 what's your expert view on it well i'm kind of hoping that the boy the one guy who could really
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:18.640]  make a change is donald trump i uh i he he wants to make our country great a lot of these other
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:24.240]  people have no interest in making our country great and i think he really genuinely does want to
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:31.920]  make our country great again i think he's got a vision like ronald reagan and uh i wish him well
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:40.320]  i hope he's another ronald reagan uh but i tell you he's not perfect even you are not perfect
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:48.160]  absolutely but anyway uh the others there's something the matter with the others anyway he's
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:54.880]  got stuff and and courage and that's helpful well he better be for real because i agree with you
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.040]  that he's the one saying the right stuff and what does it say about mainstream media though
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:04.800]  that they attack him and only backfires or that cnbc debate they all attacked that backfired as well
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:11.600]  i think the mainstream media is on its last legs well you know they had it set up that their candidate
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.480]  would be the one chosen that's the way they've done they've given us this whole series of losers
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:23.280]  yes jeb bush and when when uh trump didn't self-destruct well it's really i the most
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:30.960]  enjoyment i've had watching television in years is the consternation of the left and the establishment
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:39.040]  when their plan didn't work out and uh the and he's not self-destructing and and they don't know
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:47.520]  what to do do you think it's fair to say that the bush era is over yes the bush era is over thank god
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.240]  now let's shift gears what about the hillary era saying that bernie sanders is sexist because
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:50:01.680]  he's running against her well i think his country really is far gone if we uh like uh uh hillary but
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:09.360]  i i just don't believe the country is that bad off you know as bad as she is sanders is a nut
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.640]  yes well i agree with you i mean that talk about why it's so important that's why telling all my
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.160]  old lady friends we need everybody now get yourself registered to vote because there's

[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:06.800]  message right now the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis but
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:13.440]  they're about to lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways you never
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:19.200]  imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect look i've
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:25.040]  made predictions like this before a few years ago i warned that the housing prices would collapse
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:31.280]  before that i warned that dot com companies would crash and they did those who listened had a chance
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:37.120]  to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:44.080]  i've posted a free video at dollar danger dot com maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions but
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:50.160]  first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself you can watch the video for free
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:54:07.600]  right now by going to dollar danger dot com again that's dollar danger dot com
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:17.440]  there's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:27.520]  everybody will be treated all the same ronnie zack there'll be a golden aj eddie then we're
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.480]  going to get to all of you talking about political correctness and what's happening in the colleges
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:40.080]  the fact that they have a bunch of dumb down people it is very sad and so you can't hate them
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:45.840]  you've got to reach out to them like the cult victims they are and remember that it will be the
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:52.880]  thinkers it will be the workers the strivers that continue to build civilization phyllis
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:57.360]  laughley is our guest eagle form dot or g she was pointing out that her book a similar book
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.720]  published in 1964 a choice on an echo has been republished last year available at amazon.com
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.920]  everywhere else and of course she also is in over 100 newspapers every week with her column
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.520]  and records a weekly radio show heard in over 90 stations finishing up with other points you
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:21.600]  think are important about election 2016 if they cheat somehow and get hillary in or pull something
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:28.560]  like that i really do see a revolution in this country i don't even mean a violent revolution
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:33.120]  but i think people are getting to the point that they're not going to comply with the social
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:39.600]  engineering what do you think phyllis well i hope you're right because the the socialists have really
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:46.800]  taken over our country and uh the they have an alliance uh with the big business people
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:53.200]  and uh the these people uh you know the other people i used to call the king makers because
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:56:01.440]  they they they think they're divinely appointed uh to uh select our our president and they've
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:08.240]  given us a whole bunch of losers on the republican ticket and that's very unfortunate uh really ron
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:15.200]  reagan was the last one who was elected by the by the grassroots and it's very important you know
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:22.240]  you know the polls show that the large numbers of people who probably agree with what i'm saying
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:28.080]  don't vote they don't even bother to get themselves registered they think a plague on all your two
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:38.640]  your houses but you know politics is quite quite a a game quite a need some skill and uh it's
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:45.040]  extremely important that you be part of it and you be part of it by deciding which party you're
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.960]  going to be with we have a two-party system in this country if you don't like those two parties you
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.480]  want some other kind of party you can move to europe they've got all kinds of useless the third party
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:02.880]  sitting around they'll be glad to have you but i think that's a waste of time we you know as
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:10.400]  ron as rum shelf once said you go to war with the army you have not the army you wish you have
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:15.840]  now the army we have is a two-party system so you've got to make your choice which one you're
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:23.600]  going to work at and i've made my choice that it's the republican party and uh i am encouraging people
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:29.920]  to be delegates to the next convention and get yourself lined up with some friends in the republican
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.120]  party to make that happen well undoubtedly the democrat republican leadership the rhinos
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:41.040]  have been working to stop the the tea party insurrection that is having an effect we got rid
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.600]  of bainer they put another bad guy in but the point is it shows we're having an effect one more
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:51.440]  election we'll get more patriots in and i don't just intellectually know that myself the establishment
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:57.520]  admits that and is scared to death to the point of they're talking about censoring alternative
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:02.640]  patriot media like drudge or info wars uh and trying to stop what we're doing but that's not

[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:32.080]  where it's my house i went and sat down there was a you know there was a security camera right at the
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.320]  top as at the entrance where you come in and out that makes perfect sense you know but then when i

[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:17.840]  to what you say and samsung admits they're watching and listening exactly and then i'm even conditioned

[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.600]  on their political correct stories that ties into what he's been exposing he's written the new york

[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:39.920]  historian who was well exposing just so many different events that have unfolded i'm not
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:44.560]  going to go over his whole bio he's also credited with the hardball tactics was resulted in closing
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:50.800]  down the miami dade presidential recount stone is credited an hbo recent movie recount 2000 with
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.360]  uh fomenting the so-called brooks brothers riot in which republican mobs swarmed the recount
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:59.920]  demanding shutdown while thousands of cuban americans marched outside the courthouse he also
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:04.880]  has worked around the world with pro democracy pro american governments during elections
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:11.760]  roger stone dot com and i've met him uh and folks up in dallas uh at some of the big jfk memorial
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.080]  events like the 40th anniversary a few years ago with the reason we got him in studio as i
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:23.120]  learned he was going to be down in austin uh this week and we already had an article back on november
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:30.000]  third uh titled political strategist hillary clinton is an abuser of women and girls now i
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:36.800]  personally have interviewed women that bill clinton raped and i mean women that bill clinton uh
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:42.640]  brutally brutally raped and then settled out of court with but the word is hillary
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.000]  also has some of her own activities but it's kind of like black unemployment doubling under obama
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.640]  they then put out all this pro black rhetoric but it's really the opposite uh so we're going to be
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:10:00.320]  speaking to uh some of that today and and really going over who is hillary clinton because even
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:05.520]  if you're a democrat that that identifies with her and thinks she's some wonderful great saint
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:13.920]  with the amount of dirt uh that is in her background with the amount of dirt that's going on it makes
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:18.880]  her extremely black mailable and so that's my biggest concern with hillary not just her saying
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:25.920]  we should look at australian style uh gun confiscation uh and things like that uh and so again we also
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:32.960]  have the video of him with larry king live uh breaking that down on rt of all places so thank
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:39.040]  you so much uh for coming uh in to join us today to break all this down roger stone's our guest
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:42.720]  roger stone dot com good to see you again buddy it's great to see you thanks for having me you
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:46.400]  know i'm known for talking a lot and i know a lot about hillary and bill but you've written a book
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.560]  about it and i've read some stuff in your book that i didn't even know but then i went and looked
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:55.120]  up turned out was true uh i mean there's a lot of folks that have it out for women and like to
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:00.640]  target them most predators do for some reason um whereas most of us that aren't predators want to
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:05.360]  defend women and children what's the clinton's relationship with women yeah the point here
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.880]  of course is that the whole central uh narrative of her campaign is bogus she is not an advocate
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:16.400]  for women and girls uh she's an abuser of women and girls bill is not your rogish old uncle who
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:22.400]  just has an eye for the ladies as you know he's a serial sexual predator very much like bill cosby
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:29.520]  and the number of women that he has raped bitten sexually assaulted abused you know i identified
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.160]  in this book twenty seven individual women now some of these women's names you know why need a
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:40.640]  broad rick uh paula jones uh kathy willie but so many of the names you don't know christie zurcher
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:48.960]  becky brown carol and moffitt helen dowdy eileen wellstone uh uh uh uh liz ward grason list goes
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.080]  on and on and on now some liberals try to say to me well what does that have to do with hillary
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:59.280]  well hillary's the one who runs the cover up hillary is the point person to silence these women
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:05.040]  lest they get in the way of the clinton's lust for power and wealth uh hillary is the one who
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:12.240]  hires the heavy-handed private detectives uh jack paladino anthony palakano iven duda who go out and
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:18.480]  run a veritable terror campaign to silence these women so the notion that hillary has somehow been
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:25.120]  an advocate for women no bill rapes them physically and then hillary rapes them psychologically she's
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.240]  kind of a beard for his riping she she plays the part of i'll never you know leave my man i stand by
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:37.280]  my man he's a good guy she testifies for him she defends him uh she's an enabler yeah but it's worse
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:42.240]  than that because it's not just that he can get away with it it's that she ensures that there's no
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:48.000]  public exposure this is why the famous feminist camille paglia says hillary's a fraud her husband
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:54.480]  has degraded and exploited women or joanne venoche the feminist writer for the boston globe the
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:13:00.720]  liberal newspaper says that bill clinton should be held to the same standard as bill cosby it
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.120]  looks this is your research deep research that i've been on this for years who's more of an
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:10.480]  abuser of women cosby or clinton i think clinton because cosby you see drugs them whereas clinton
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:16.160]  just uses brute force alex i i interviewed three women that he bit he bites through the upper lip
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.800]  it's kind of his signature first of all it's a disabling move because of course a woman then
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.880]  stops trying to cover what a pit bull does right he tries to cover her mouth and then
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:32.080]  secondarily it's a not so subtle message to keep your mouth shut so uh this guy is a criminal uh
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:38.800]  he is uh he's a sex addict he's a pedophile the book goes way beyond this we tie his epic
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:44.720]  drug use the fact that he himself was a habitual user of cocaine that he was in and out of drug
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:49.680]  rehab when he was governor that he was involved as you know and in the whole question of drug
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:55.280]  trafficking in and out of arkansas in connection with the bushes in connection with the central
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:01.760]  intelligence agency and when dan lassiter the biggest drug dealer in arkansas when he was
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:06.400]  ultimately convicted of drug trafficking he went out and got himself this really smart
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:11.920]  woman lawyer her name was hillary clinton and she and her law partner vince foster why they
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:18.720]  arranged for lassiter to get a full pardon from governor bill clinton wow and then now today at
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:24.320]  a bigger scale she heads up the state department and gets billions of dollars uh you know brought
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:28.560]  into their foundation hundreds of millions from dictators and people on lists that you can't sell
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:33.280]  weapons to and then she waves that and lets the state department give a green light to shipping
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:39.040]  weapons to countries in exchange for money i mean these people really are the criminals criminal
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:43.840]  yeah look the clinton foundation is not a foundation and it's not a charity it's two things it's a
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.240]  slush fund for grifters and secondarily it's just a vehicle for the facilitation of massive bribes
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.440]  so for example the country of qatar wants to overthrow qaddafi who although he's not a great
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:02.400]  guy is an ally of the united states is feeding us intelligence on al qaeda they put 1.5 million
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:08.080]  in bill's pocket for a 20 minute speech bribe they put a million dollars in hillary's pocket
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:14.240]  for a 20 minute speech bribe they put 2.5 million dollars into the clinton foundation
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:19.840]  at the same time they're paying off tony blear in the uk and sarcosi in france and lo and behold
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:27.520]  we topple qaddafi and women in libya who under qaddafi were allowed to vote be educated go outside
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:34.160]  without a veil drive a car choose their own husband women have been set back 200 years in libya they
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:38.800]  go from having the best quality of life in the continent of africa to the worst that's hillary
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:45.760]  clinton the advocate for women it is like she's a wicked witch i mean it's not normally fair to
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:51.760]  just use analogies like that i'll get you in your little log too but everything she touches it just
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:59.280]  gets destroyed everything she does is evil and then her lies about being in combat you know being
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:05.440]  shot at when they landed in syria none of it's true ryan williams loses a job over it not her
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.960]  how can she get away with so much it's amazing so last week she comes out uh with a two weeks ago
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:17.120]  with a gun control proposal and she says in it that if you have been accused of domestic abuse
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:21.360]  you should not be allowed to own a gun well under that circumstance she wouldn't be allowed to own
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:27.040]  a gun because as we've proven the book she has kicked bitten scratched slapped and thrown hard
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:33.280]  objects at her husband this is a woman with a volcanic temper a foul mouth very short tempered
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:38.320]  very very greedy uh this is someone who doesn't have the temperament to be president as you know
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.400]  it's been reported i mean from fb agents and others that work in the white house that she
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:48.000]  rolls on the floor and choose carpet only the person that does that was hitler that that's
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.680]  pretty amazing look we do know this that when she was in arkansas attending to her sick father
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.480]  and she learned that bill clinton was entertaining barbara stryce and overnight at the uh white
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:03.040]  house she flew back to washington the next day he appeared with an enormous scratch across his face
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:08.720]  didi meyers the press secretary the president tried to say initially that he had cut himself
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:14.400]  shaving she was forced to admit no hillary had scratched him so was that because she
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.320]  wanted a piece of the action no i think it was because he was humiliating her you see i think
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:24.640]  they have this weird uh dysfunctional sham relationship where uh chelsea clinton is not
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:29.840]  bill's biological daughter webster hobble right webster hobble i document this in the book bill
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:37.120]  has a mixed race african-american son in arkansas uh dany williams uh without any question the son
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:43.920]  of bill clinton and bobby and williams now the star magazine the star tabloid wrote in 99 when
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.600]  hillary was warming up for the senate race that a dna test had disproved that i tracked this down
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:56.000]  the star was owned at that time by man named robert altman altman headed the the the sec
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.040]  under bill clinton was forced to resign major donor to the clinton campaigns clinton foundation
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:06.800]  clinton roommate at georgetown the new owners of the star american media they opened their
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:13.040]  files for me guess what there is no there is no dna test there never was dumb but they tell us
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:18.560]  black lives matter alex black lives matter unless you're unless you're dany williams in which case
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:22.720]  they can just sweep you out into the carpet so the clinton's they lecture us about it takes a
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:29.280]  village to raise a kid why don't they step up and love support acknowledge nurture their son
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:35.600]  dany williams well because it doesn't fit into the larger narrative of where the clinton's even
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:40.800]  came from yes we i mean we know clinton's story but but but what about hillary digging into her
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:46.160]  one or other little juicy tidbits in the book well we talk extensively we examine the relationship
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:51.840]  between she and huma abedin i mean huma abedin is um her parents and her brothers of course are
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.440]  active in the muslim brotherhood uh she has a full security clearance and a full time job at the
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.880]  state department she's the only woman in the history of the u.s. government to have a waiver
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.600]  that allows her to not only work full time for the state department but also work for tineo
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.560]  which is a clinton connected lobbying firm that represents a number of middle eastern governments
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:18.080]  in front of uh the state department while she's triple dipping and get a check out of the clinton
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:23.600]  foundation when she travels with hillary they stay in the same room we know this because i foy
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.720]  it the their travel uh uh schedules and when we ask the state it really is amazing how much you
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.720]  ferret it out yes and when you ask the state department why is that they say well hillary has
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.360]  an acute health problem and therefore she might need to be attended to in the night well if she's
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:42.560]  got a health problem but we need to know that look i spent 40 years in the corroded rectum of the
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.200]  two-party system i worked for three republican presidents i was on nine presidential campaigns
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:51.760]  worked in the senate worked in the house you know the bushes and the clintons are in this together

[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:14.000]  news tonight getting into even more seven o'clock central uh he was the chairman of donald trump's
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:19.600]  exploratory campaign uh previously when he thought about running for president he was on the campaign
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:23.840]  until his book came out and and you know he resigned himself he talked to trump this morning
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:27.840]  so that we could pick your brain about trump but you were telling me off air trumps for real
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:32.880]  oh there's no question look i i don't agree with trump on everything we've been friends 37 years i
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:37.680]  very strongly supported for president for one simple reason you can't buy trump you can't bully
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.480]  trump he doesn't answer to wall street he doesn't answer lobbyists he doesn't interest in special
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:47.040]  interest not the coke brothers no one donald trump is his own man he'd be the first president we've
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:53.040]  had who really worked solely for the american people uh and it's that incorruptibility plus uh
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:57.680]  he's not afraid to take on you know unpopular politically incorrect stances he knows that
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:02.160]  some there's something hinky about 9 11 he knows the immigration well i know he's suddenly been
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:05.520]  saying stuff about it freaking the bushes out you were telling me that you're educating him
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:11.040]  well he's a reader the nice thing about trump is that he he's open-minded and he was astounded
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.160]  by what he learned that as you know alex that we had numerous warnings that this was going to happen
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:22.320]  that went completely unheeded uh and it's just like the birther question trump fearlessly brought
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:28.240]  that into the mainstream you and i know it but you couldn't get it on cbs or nbc or cnn or msnbc
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:32.880]  trump is the guy who brought the whole question of obama's birth and where he was really born
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:37.040]  into the political mainstream where people could consider it and it's why he zoomed in the head
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.520]  of the polls three years ago he should have challenged mit romney then i was in favor of going
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:47.120]  then so um i remain his strongest supporter and a close friend i what do you expect the clinton
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:51.280]  is to do to try to come after him well they're already trying to spread this rumor that you
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.520]  know donald was always in bed with organized crime let me tell you something you cannot get a new
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:01.360]  jersey casino control license and hold one for 13 years if you're in bed with the mob it's just
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:06.400]  not possible they have the most stringent laws they put a practice scope right up your dairy air
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:12.320]  and they look at every financial transaction in your entire life donald trump uh is clean and they
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:16.240]  got nothing on him i mean well why would you want to be in bed with the mob they take money from
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:21.040]  anyways well i think the supposition is he's in the construction industry has to buy cement he's in
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:25.840]  the northeast you know guys guys who are italian therefore he must be mobbed up it's a macguffin
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:30.000]  it's bull but they're going to try to smear him with that that's coming wait and see you're going
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.720]  to see it out of politico you're going to see it out of cnn it's going to go nowhere they don't have
[02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:38.240]  anything on him because what you see is what you get that's the great thing about trump
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:45.920]  he is unscripted he is uncoached he is uncontrolled he might say anything i love the idea of a hillary
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:52.880]  trump debate because he'll get right in her face on the drugs on the misogyny on the on the corruption
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:59.920]  on the clinton foundation on her her covering up rape and the serial rape of her husband so he's
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:04.480]  going to really go after i have no doubt about it the guy's fearless i mean you've you've seen him
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:10.720]  he's totally completely fearless and nobody can get to him i mean uh having worked in the senate
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:15.600]  having worked in the house having been a heavy duty lobbyist i can tell you for example
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:20.560]  that every dollar of waste in the federal budget was put there by someone who wants it there and
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:24.000]  that's the reason no one ever really cuts it sure it's their piece of the pie all right they all
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.800]  talk about it trump would be immune to that he would take an axe to the federal budget so when
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:34.960]  the commentators say oh your your tax cut plan on working people would cause a 1.5 trillion dollar
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:39.600]  hole why do you assume that trump is going to cut the daylights out of him out of federal spending
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:44.400]  he would and then when the lobbyists call and say oh you can't cut that he would be immune to that
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:49.680]  you can't get to trump well here's the issue as you know they keep ballooning things it's all
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:54.800]  going to go bankrupt we have to save the ship right well uh look unless somebody gets serious
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:28:01.680]  about cutting federal spending uh bringing back all uh those uh the two trillion dollars that's
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:08.000]  offshore and inversion uh and actually negotiating a trade deal with the chinese the mexicans the
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:13.200]  japanese which is in our interest instead of giving away the store uh you know this country's
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:17.840]  headed to the toilet you know that only trump can save america in my opinion because he's independent
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.720]  of the of the washington power structure this is a short segment long segments coming up but
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:28.000]  getting back into hillary and things they might pull i mean it's bold for george soros in the
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.480]  white house uh and fast and furious and the kill the cops movement and all that i mean they really
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:38.080]  are trying to destabilize this country you've been an insider you've seen it from all different
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:43.040]  perspectives what do you think they're really trying and are they being successful well
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.880]  i think we're in very perilous times on the other hand the liberty movement has never
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:52.720]  been stronger than it is today there was a time we had one congressman now we have about 30 uh and
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:57.520]  thank god for the internet of course the real reason they want to regulate the internet
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:03.440]  is to shut our communications down if it weren't people for people like you uh and and for that
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:09.360]  extent me who are out there uh all you know working to get out an alternative narrative
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:15.200]  not only about our history about what is happening today um we would we'd have no prospect at all
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:20.720]  this is why i think trump is striking the cord that he is because he's not politically correct
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:25.360]  he's willing to say things that need to be said in order to save the country and i can just tell you
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:30.480]  the power structure is going out of their mind they've they've he vanquished jeb now they're
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:36.800]  elevating marco as the next uh puppet of the establishment and trump's pair to devastate him
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:43.280]  too wow and uh i'll tell you one thing for sure it's going to be very exciting times
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:48.000]  we are not living in boring times it is just explosive what's happening we'll be back we're

[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:42.880]  thing and turn the whole campus just into a mental illness fest and so now i said earlier this morning
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:47.760]  when he resigned right when the show started i said this will only encourage the mobs of politically

[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:14.240]  of that that's why at the new un summit this is mainstream news in germany we have it up on info

[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:38.000]  for the free speech so listen it's all or nothing now because we're winning in the info war we have

[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.200]  we found in fact everybody around here just gets beer bought for them at restaurants and in dinner
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.840]  literally bought a farm when you wear it joe bigs and others have had that happen to him but it's a
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:32.960]  great conversation starter and then on the back say info wars dot com legalized freedom i want to

[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:05.760]  women the new book uh in bookstores everywhere rogerstone.com you need to get it you need to
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:10.400]  send it to talk show how she to get it covered because we may know that these are serial women
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.120]  of users but the general public still isn't really aware of because glorious time and others
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:19.200]  have been covering it up yeah the the clinton's are moving heaven and earth to try to bury this
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:25.760]  book within hours of it being released two two days ago i tracked an inordinate number of one star
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:31.120]  reviews on amazon one sentence this book is crap this book has all been discredited this is the same
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.400]  old thing rogerstone's a right-wing hitman i have my own it people they didn't take them long to
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:43.360]  track every one of those those reviews to the exact same ip address where the clinton headquarters
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.960]  in brooklyn new york and to their credit when my lawyers contacted amazon they took those down so
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:54.080]  folks if you read the book if you like the book do two things pass it on to another woman because
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:58.560]  if every woman reads this book hillary clinton will get no votes for women and secondarily if
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.200]  you like the book go on amazon leave a favorable review the book is this close to the new york
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:08.800]  times bestseller list and if it makes it it's so much harder for the mainstream media to ignore
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:14.640]  what is the truth well you've got an average of 78 percent reviews so they're they're attacks aren't
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:19.280]  working too well well because we had a number of them removed and our number therefore went up i've
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:24.320]  never paid a person to go online i don't organize people to go on other than when i'm on radio when
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:29.920]  i'm tv uh on liberty oriented outlets i ask people if you like the book if you think we're striking
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:35.760]  a chord here go on amazon and let people know well we're in an info war and it's not that the republican
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:40.480]  party is perfect either you're about to expose the bushes here it's just that the system's scared
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:46.160]  of a patriot takeover the republican party that's our best avenue there's a war going on right now
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:51.840]  no question and it's time to defeat all these rhinos and i don't know if trump's perfect you know
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:56.080]  and a lot of folks i know that know him by the scenes they know he's the real deal all i know is
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:38:01.360]  he didn't hillary clinton and i'm not into lesser two evils she says she's coming for my gun she says
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:06.480]  she's getting rid of the borders she says families are basically bad uh and i know how and i know what
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.480]  the clinton's have done to me personally with dirty treks when that when he was president
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:17.920]  i don't want to live under that again so for me this is personal as well get into jeb bush because
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:22.080]  do you think he was ever really running against her i mean they're too tenacious and too arrogant
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:27.280]  to be a ringer for hillary right but wouldn't he kind of de facto turn into a ringer for well
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:31.440]  they're in business together look the clinton's and the bushes are constantly rehabilitating
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.840]  each other compliment each other elevate each other several months ago think about it alex
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:41.360]  she was attacking jeb why she wanted to elevate him within the republican contest he was he was
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:45.840]  he was he was listing and she needed to prop him up i'll tell you what his job is
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:52.240]  is designated loser that's his position they know so he knows that look the together they found
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:59.280]  as they form a nonprofit they raise 138 million dollars for Haitian earthquake relief they spend
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:05.200]  10 million in Haitian in Haiti they pocket the under the other 128 million they closed the
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:11.120]  nonprofit and they answer no questions this is the bush clinton crime syndicate in january i have
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:16.320]  a book coming out called jeb and the bush crime family you can go on amazon and pre-order it right
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:22.720]  now the entire arc of crime by the clip by the bush family jeb who was a drug dealer in his
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:29.200]  college and and boarding room days in his early business days in houston and miami uh prescott
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:34.320]  bush who made his money arming the nazis who made his money off slave labor and he was actually
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:38.560]  the main lawyer in the u.s. yeah and his bank was confiscated by the truman administration
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:45.360]  i'm gonna fold it up for you for uh for uh for treasonous activity uh george hw bush who only
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:51.520]  avoided indictment in the iran contra matter because he's stonewall the special prosecutor he
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:56.880]  wouldn't hand over documents as you know alex he's the one who oversaw the trafficking of millions
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:02.320]  of dollars worth of cocaine into the united states to illegally be sold and raise money
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:06.720]  for the contras and his partner in that the governor they found who would let them ship the
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:12.240]  cocaine into his state but the other way bill clinton and it's i'm not giving ron reagan the
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:16.320]  past i've talked to the folks that were in the white house they literally kept him compartmentalized
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:20.400]  we sort of trying to dig into it that's when they shot him there's no question about it first of all
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:25.760]  hinkley is not did not shoot the bullet that hit reagan as i as i will show in my upcoming book
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:29.920]  there's a second shooter sure there's so much we have not been told well they had dinner with hinkley
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:34.480]  a few days before there's so many more there's so many more that was in the that was in the
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:39.200]  denver post there are so many more connections between hinkley and the bushes there's an immediate
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:44.080]  struggle by the bush people for control of the football immediately while reagan is incapacitated
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:47.760]  here's what people do and then alexander haig runs out and says i've got it i'm in control well
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:54.960]  here's what's interesting bush pressured reagan to sign a secret transfer of power agreement
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:59.760]  haig was opposed ed meese the attorney general was opposed weinberg and the secretary defense
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:03.520]  every single member of the reagan cabinet was opposed sure that's what i heard people made
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:07.520]  fun of the bush system of haig but haig was actually saying no i've got it you don't have it
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:12.080]  right because they were trying to get it right so what happens here is reagan signs the secret
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:16.720]  transfer of power agreement that says that in the event of the president being incapacitated here's
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:23.600]  what will happen and as soon as he signs six days later there's an attempt on his life by a man
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:29.440]  associated with the bush family now all five of hinkley shots are accounted for none of them hit
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:34.880]  reagan there's a second gunman you can clearly see him in the pictures in my next book i lay out
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:38.800]  the entire bush connection to the reagan asset well i want to sell your books on our store too
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:43.280]  i'm gonna carry them all in fact i knew who you were i've met you before i don't know why i wasn't
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:47.440]  thinking get you on because i mean i know a lot of your amazing work and then richard reeves thank
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.560]  god one of my friends and does some work with us called up and said don't you want to get this guy
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:53.920]  on you're writing articles about it yeah i really want to thank you for coming in i appreciate being
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:57.840]  here what's crazy is i've done all the research myself but you forget so much of it you're here
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:02.400]  spewing it out you've got a document in your book you start thinking of all the stuff the bushes
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.680]  the clintons have done they're like james bond villains oh it's work they're worse they're worse
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:13.120]  because they're look this is what we call elite deviants the bushes and the clintons they can lie
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:17.760]  they can steal they can do drugs they can traffic drugs they can have their own email server they
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:24.000]  can misuse classified documents they can have people murdered they can they can be involved in epic
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:29.840]  financial fraud and they pay no price the laws don't apply to the bushes or the clintons that's
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.720]  why i'm for trump we have to change this it's time for these criminals to be brought to justice
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:38.320]  the question is if trumps for real which i believe you that he thinks he's for real
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:42.080]  certainly is better than hillary they're going to come after him and you said they're going to
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:46.640]  claim mafia ties i mean that's talk about the pot calling the kettle black yeah plus he has
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:52.480]  just tripled up his personal security as you may know he's been afforded so a secret service
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:57.120]  uh protection that kind of bothers me you know you don't want that i don't think you do i think
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:01.120]  a they're spying for the government and b you don't know that you're safe in their hands but
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:05.440]  and they ask me now i'm not saying the average guy's bad but that's usually how they get you
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:10.960]  they've got their shadow specter operatives to use a popular term hydro whatever you want to call it
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:16.240]  they've got their operatives in every major agency there's no question about that so look i i do think
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:22.080]  wait until trump starts talking about monetary reform because i know his views on monetary reform
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:26.480]  and the printing press money that we keep churning out give us any old secrets or i guess yeah he's
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:30.560]  a hard money man he thinks it's time to look at gold i can tell you that right now trump
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:36.080]  understands that the the bankers have gone crazy and that the federal reserve is you know is not
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:40.400]  provided for in our government well it seems like he is getting more informed all the time when he
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:45.200]  went after jeb on 9 11 and i was told by another person that knows him that no no he knows what's
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:50.000]  going on now you're telling me and it's on record used to be his campaign had this is wild well and
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.840]  i we're going to get him in here to do your show because i think you guys will hit it off he's a
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:59.760]  truth teller now look his political interests are not that that long meaning when the country was
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:05.440]  stronger he was just focused on building his business and his brand the man is above all a
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:10.480]  patriot he's giving up the greatest life in the world i mean he's got a beautiful family he's got
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:14.560]  a luxury existence he could play golf every afternoon on the greatest golf course in the world
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:19.520]  which he built uh he's climbed every business mountain you can climb in terms of great development
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:25.360]  great hotels great businesses he's got an international uh a billion dollar company
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:30.400]  he's met more world leaders face to face one on one than anybody else running for president
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:35.760]  people find that interesting uh but he doesn't want a new cold war with putin no he understands
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.880]  that that's that that that there's a whole culture as you know alex of endless war they're always
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:46.080]  trying to sell you on war he thinks he thinks for example lindsay graham this he thinks this guy's
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:51.840]  a jerk uh and he called him out as a jerk uh lindsay was all over him for campaign contributions
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:56.640]  oh donald here's my here's my personal cell phone number anytime you need anything just call me as
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:01.520]  you may remember trump called it out on national television yeah so uh no look i think he's the
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:06.480]  real deal i can tell you he is unscripted and uncontrolled which means that the political
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:11.680]  establishment cannot control him boy they're gonna come after him i think probably with the same
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:15.360]  thing they came after reagan with well they've already tried i mean they've tried first to
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:20.160]  discredit him remember they said oh after his immigration comments he's gonna crash and burn
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:24.880]  then after he took on john mccain he's gonna crash and burn then they said that he's not
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:28.560]  going to show up for the debates there's no way he'll show up for the debates after every debate
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:34.480]  he went up so uh i think the guy is fearless i think he's having the time of his life and then
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:39.040]  karson's blowing himself up in front of everybody now i can't figure out the karson thing out it's
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:44.960]  i just don't see him having the the strength look the job is chief executive trump is a guy who's
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.320]  run a multi-billion dollar international company with hundreds of thousands of employees he's a
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:54.880]  manager and he could better manage the country i don't think you need to know the name of every
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:01.280]  obscure uh rebel islamic fanatic leader all you need to know is who the good guys are the bad guys
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:05.360]  are wouldn't it be nice to have a president united states who put the united states government
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:10.560]  oh no trump has said don't don't back isis which which our government's been doing and then he's
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:14.400]  he supports taking him out and he supports the russians he says great let the russians pay for
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:18.640]  it i mean that's a perfect plan well he gets somebody else to take him out that's even better
[02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:22.400]  let's look at historically there's only one man running for president in this election
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:26.800]  who was opposed to the iraq war who said it was an enormous mistake and that's donald trump
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:34.240]  that is true both parties were for it yeah even bernie sanders you know who says he's a democratic
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:38.720]  socialist which is like being a meat eating vegetarian i mean you're either socialist you
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:42.240]  believe in democracy you can't believe in both they're not consistent you think bernie sanders is
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:48.000]  just really stupid or is he evil uh i actually think he's worse he's a true believer knows he's
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:52.800]  a he's a true believing socialist he believes in the state and can state control of our lives
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:56.960]  even though it never works anywhere right because his his solution is simple the government's
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:01.360]  going to do everything for you he just doesn't mention the 85 percent tax rate that he has in
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:06.320]  mind and that always select insider groups are basically exempt and consolidate power but and
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:10.720]  that's what socialists don't get the same people that have gamed our system now are going to game
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:16.560]  a socialist system even worse don't they understand that no and what's interesting of course is i did
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:21.680]  a book signing here in austin last night uh night before last and we had a really great turnout
[02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:25.840]  brave new books which is a great little freedom oriented bookshop i think you've been there yep
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:31.600]  half the people there were bernie sanders people because they know that hillary is not a liberal
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:36.800]  or a progressive she's a whore for wall street she'll be aware for whatever the money is they're
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:41.040]  the ones that set up all the derivatives under clinton right so the left will buy her it's not
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:46.240]  that she's a true believer she just buyable the sorrows of this world can buy her she believes
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:52.000]  in in nothing so just as the bushes are not conservatives they're crony capitalists the
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  clintons are really crony capitalists but they'll be bought by the the big government the big business
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:03.360]  interests of the left so even those people know that she's inherently evil and she must be stopped
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:06.640]  we're going to go to break and come back with a few politically correct phone calls for this
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:09.840]  segment the next till about five after then you're going to be on the nightly news tonight
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:12.960]  really want to get you on the show more often because everything you're saying from my own
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:18.160]  research is dead on but you said so eloquently but what are other big tidbits that you wouldn't
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:21.040]  you know i don't want to say talking points but points you had in your mind you wanted to make
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:25.120]  when you got here that you'd like to make in the next three minutes well i guess the largest
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:30.560]  single one is that you know look i was a republican my entire life and i had great sentimental attachment
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:35.200]  to the republican party of berry goldwater that was the small government personal freedom
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:39.120]  keep the government out of your business out of your bedroom that's the ron paul republic right
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:43.520]  they barely exist anymore unfortunately both parties have morphed into one party
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:48.160]  it's the party of endless war it's the party at erosion of our civil liberties it's the party of
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:53.280]  massive debt and more borrowing it's the party of high taxes on working people but the but the
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:59.840]  hedge fund managers on wall street they pay virtually nothing uh so uh it's it's very hard for me i'm
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:03.120]  a registered libertarian at this point although there's a lot of folks there that i think are
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:09.200]  nuts too the problem here is that that the old republican party will only be worth fighting
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:13.440]  for if we have a leader within it i'll probably switch back to the republican party to vote for
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:17.840]  for donald trump in next year's primaries because he's the first candidate i've seen who i'm actually
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:23.600]  enthusiastic about i've been trying to get him to run for president since 1988 when i took him
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:28.160]  to new hampshire to speak to the port smith uh new hampshire chamber of commerce vice president
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:34.000]  bush had been there the week before had 500 people donald trump went we had 2,800 people this is 1988
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.320]  sure i don't want to get any infighting going on but i know you know glenn back uh he does a lot
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:43.840]  of good things we we support what most of his work he doesn't like donald trump and i understand
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:47.680]  some of the reasons because of his you know past political activities just being a businessman in
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:52.880]  new york when hillary was a senator but i mean so far he he he is saying the right things
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:57.360]  and he's better than the other candidates yeah look i like glenn and i look forward to ask him
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:02.080]  you know what his beef is with donald trump uh people do evolve politically i don't think trump
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:06.960]  was all that politically aware or interested when the country was stronger and he was building his
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:13.120]  business he is right he's played the game if you're a businessman if you don't put campaign
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:17.200]  contributions into the pockets of the politicians they don't even listen to you it's not that you're
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:22.160]  buying favors you can't even buy an audience and you have an obligation when you have thousands
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:26.800]  of people working for you to get your point of view in front of government so sure he has a
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:32.160]  relationship uh and frankly his attitude was we have a federal limit on donations so the first
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:36.400]  10 politicians to walk in give them the maximum share them on their way they're all worthless
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:40.800]  anyway and now when they show up asking for money say oh i'd love to help you but i've already hit
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:45.520]  my legal maximum well i know this and we did have a president that wasn't actively trying to put us
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:51.360]  into world government and the tpp we would it'd be like untying a boat from the dock when the engine's
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.760]  on we are tied up i mean they're fighting to keep us politically and financially suppressed
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:00.400]  and control us all you gotta do is cut that out and we'll explode so listen up here guys

[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:27.600]  well roger stowe roger stowe dot com is our guest really interesting fellow and back when
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:31.840]  trump was considering running on this exploratory committee was the head of his campaign and so
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:35.760]  i'll hold you to it we i don't think we really even tried to get trump on we should really push to
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:39.360]  do that we shouldn't think they're guests too big to get on the show we've had a lot of big guests
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:44.480]  obviously on over the years that's a no-brainer i think we actually have tried but it's it's hard
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:50.400]  because we have such a small campaign staff take two uh two uh two uh get through to him next i will
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:54.240]  try to set that up i think he'd have a good time and i think you'd enjoy talking to him you guys
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:55:00.400]  have hit it off because he is very upset about the about the direction of the country he's given up
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:06.880]  a lot to make this race but he wants to make america great again and trust me he's the real deal well
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:11.520]  i hope you're right we'll certainly find out if he gets elected and then gets in there i know this
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:14.960]  people are really counting on him so if he gets in there he better deliver of course they could
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:19.360]  just let everything fall apart once he gets in which is kind of the timeline and then blame
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:24.560]  him for what happens i think they're gonna have their hands full this guy is a take charge guy
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:29.680]  he's an optimist there's nothing he can't do look he's a working graduate he's very smart he knows
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:36.000]  exactly what's going on here he's sick of the whole political correct agenda he understands that freedom
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.920]  is on the ropes uh and he's saying that gun free zones are places for crazy people to go kill the
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:47.280]  guy let this be care he's carrying anytime you see him trust me brother he's carrying he's had a
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:51.920]  concealed carry permit in new york which they don't give out they're very hard to get oh and the
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:56.320]  media acted like it's weird that he'd want to have a gun when he's a target how many death threats do
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.880]  you think he gets a week i mean it's extraordinary and they ask us not to talk about it uh well that
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:05.840]  shows how warped it is yeah exactly but he gets a lot of death threats oh well sure because he's
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:10.960]  speaking out on a lot of controversial subjects so you do say he's tripled his security he's tripled
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:17.040]  his security uh he himself carries both his sons are gun enthusiasts very active hunters and gun
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:22.000]  enthusiasts they both carry i love it uh you know they're strong believers in the second man oh he
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.200]  was president he'd carry well you know obama's not carrying anything but maybe a reagan carried
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:32.480]  reagan had a holster you know on his uh calf he was carrying about 80 percent of the time
[02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:36.000]  when he was running for president and when he was president well you're crazy if you don't
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.400]  yep everybody's like hey let the cops have guns what about us yeah i'm sure he wishes he was carried
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:44.480]  when hinkley tried to take him out or hinkley and others tried to take him just like the sir hand
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:49.200]  sir hand crap aj called an earlier i had to put him on hold and he mentioned going to this red robin
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:53.680]  hamburger place i'm at the police state and they've got where you order your food from a computer
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:58.480]  it's got a camera watching you i saw a chili's ad where it's got a camera so he was going to
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:05.520]  finish his story so what happened when you discovered this um well basically uh i asked him
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:10.080]  to wait for some you know what's the deal with the camera inside there and she's like what camera
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:15.520]  looked at the television screen and then she said whoa there's a camera in there i had no idea
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:21.920]  uh you could just turn it away if you want so alex from what she told me i basically garnered
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:29.920]  two ideas in my head of what she knew she either lied to me or it's just completely stupid and
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:35.280]  unawake i hope she i think it's not even stupid they just don't care they're in a trance i appreciate
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:39.760]  your call i'm glad you finished the story but we're gonna go out to a chili's that's the place i
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:44.800]  know is doing it i mean talk about 1984 yeah it's interesting what it means is you gotta
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:48.720]  have a piece of masking tape when you go get a burger that's the thing what does trump think about
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:54.160]  the whole nsa thing i think he's opposed to government spying i mean he is uh you know we
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:59.360]  have been very concerned when i was there about whether his own phone calls his own email were
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:05.120]  being looked at um he's obviously got an enormous a number of advisors in business and around the
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:09.680]  globe who are giving him uncensored information that you'd never get from the government or the

[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:40.640]  guest really exciting how to have him here with us go ahead zack uh yes actually i had uh called
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:45.120]  a while ago and just was kind of no i know we're going over politically correct calls now i apologize
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:48.560]  i made you whole but a guest came in but he's willing to comment on it i tell your politically
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:54.800]  correct story well i guess i had two points i studied math and engineering and physics in college
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:01:00.560]  and kind of what i discovered was in those classes most of your professors you know you could
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:05.120]  characterize them as being you know you know conservative and you know none of them never
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:08.880]  come out and say they believed in god but they you could tell that they would you know privately
[03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:14.400]  say yeah well you know it's my opinion that such things do exist but as soon as you know part of
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:18.640]  the school that i graduated from was the liberal arts so university so you had to take some what i
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.680]  would call cream puff classes and as soon as you get into those classes it was just a totally
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:31.040]  different feel um much more political indoctrination in those types of classes and what i also kind
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:35.760]  of discovered was you know i took a lot of those towards the end of my you know academic career
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:41.920]  because i focused mostly on math and physics but once they you know you part of your requirements
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:46.000]  was to construct a reasonable argument but when you got into these classes you could just sit there
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  and pick these guys with arguments apart because they're not even following what you know you're
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:54.720]  being taught in your physics and math classes and it just well sure look at now what they teach in
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:00.480]  common core two plus two equals five literally that's trying to sabotage children's minds great
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:05.200]  point jack appreciate you're holding to tell us that and even if i don't get to you guys coming up
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:10.560]  david night is going to no david nice to the nightly news tonight it's paul watson
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:15.760]  doing the fourth hour i want to go to these other colors but i've got to give you the last word here
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.360]  what are you going to be covering i mean you'll obviously recap on the nightly news tonight but
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:23.840]  what other areas are you going to be covering tonight well okay i i think it's important to bore
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:30.080]  down uh on the bushes uh your caller just raised it this is what is not known you know who the
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:36.080]  partners are in obama phone that would be carlo slim the mexican billionaire and his partner
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:42.960]  jeb bush yes um oh my gosh that's right jeb's involved jeb's the obama phone moneymaker exactly
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:48.880]  so before he became a candidate for president jeb transferred his stock in trackphone the company
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:54.000]  that has the contract from the feds for obama phone to his son so he wouldn't have to disclose it
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:59.200]  publicly unfortunately the woman who was the notary for the stock transfer happened to be a
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:04.000]  liberty republican and she kept a copy of the documents good so the point of course here is
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:10.160]  that jeb has made money on obama care he made money on obama phones and now he hopes to make a fortune
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:16.000]  on common core because his brother is deeply invested in common core the common core curriculum
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:21.600]  common core textbooks so the bush family they're profiteers and they and they make money off of
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:27.360]  their policies channel like grand paul diva the nazis exactly there really is no end of these people
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:33.680]  no and and they're all the same so the you know this is why barbara bush says oh bill clinton is
[03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:39.600]  the fifth bush brother and and and george w says bill clinton is my brother from another mother
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:45.520]  which makes hillary like my sister-in-law this is disgusting this is sensuous yeah no and they're all
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:50.480]  in it together they're making millions and millions of dollars out of the big state policies that they
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:54.800]  push and they're just the corrupt managers for all the multinationals that are buying and selling
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:04:00.320]  our country like their pawns on a chessboard what should we call this interview when it goes up to
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:10.720]  youtube and facebook other places um you know uh i mean how do we encapsulate um what's happening
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:14.640]  author exposes clinton's crimes against women i think it's bigger than that this is a powerful
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.880]  interview yeah i know i think it is i think it's two things first of all is it is the hypocrisy
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:23.760]  of the clinton's and their claims about being advocates for women uh and then it's the bush
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:29.440]  clinton crime syndicate because that's what they are they're a crime bush clinton crime syndicate
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:33.520]  exposed yep that's it but what i really give people to watch the videos and there's any
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:38.240]  happy open discussions with the viewers and listeners says uh trump insider exposes bushes
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:41.840]  and clinton's that works for me because then they'll who knows i gotta come up with some
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.320]  headlines here hey paul watson's coming up i apologize to the callers i tried to hold you over

[03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:21.120]  all joseph watson back with the fourth hour overdrive of the alex jones show we're going
[03:08:21.120 --> 03:08:27.360]  to be delving back into the political correctness issue obviously the president of the university
[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:34.320]  of missouri has been forced to step down basically for the crime of being white we're going to delve
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:40.080]  back into that story but before the break a couple of callers dropped off i am going to be taking
[03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:45.920]  calls in the next segment so that's about 20 minutes away eight eight eight two five three
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:50.320]  three one three nine so we've got ronnie in texas christian there was another couple of
[03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:54.960]  callers that dropped off call back in because i'm going to get back into all those issues
[03:08:54.960 --> 03:09:01.280]  in the next segment but first i wanted to start with this story and it's out of the daily caller
[03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:07.680]  here's an inside look at china's frightening new move to control social behavior now this is important
[03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:15.040]  because it's not just happening in china for at least five six seven years they've tried to implement
[03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:22.160]  these same policies in the united states in the west in the context of internet censorship and
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:28.560]  having to get government permission to post on the internet that's the way it's going they're
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:34.640]  trying to introduce a driver's license for the internet where if you dare to misbehave and
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:40.720]  say something xenophobic you might get punished you might get your welfare cut you might get your
[03:09:40.720 --> 03:09:47.120]  internet access removed altogether so this is out of the daily caller the internet has become a tool
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:52.400]  for the chinese communist party to keep its citizens in place through through the web the government
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:57.520]  surveils their every move and puts them behind bars if their online behavior is not in line
[03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:05.280]  with beijing sentiment recently chinese officials began developing a social credit system in which
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:12.320]  the government keeps what amounts to an internet credibility score on each citizen experts discuss
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:18.560]  the system during the ongoing china forum in washington dc which they say reveals a real world
[03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:27.360]  1984 style totalitarian state in the making listen to this because this has come in we report on
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:34.640]  this five years ago the exact same system and they're still trying to push it quote it will mark
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:42.720]  the arrival of an unprecedented information totalitarianism said chow yashui the chinese writer
[03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:48.480]  and renowned critic of the chinese communist party it's issuing a driver's license for speech
[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:56.400]  you will be subjected to point deduction for violation of speech once you have no points
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:03.920]  left you will be barred from going on the road again so again remember political correctness
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:11.520]  found its origins not just in the frankfort school but also in communist china back during the mao
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:17.760]  era because to be politically incorrect was to say something against the government now for years
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:23.680]  in china they've been trying to drown out dissent on the internet they cut off entire regions from
[03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:30.000]  internet access if they're civil unrest in a certain area they've been trying to implement this real
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:34.320]  id for bloggers for anybody who posts on the internet similar to what facebook has done for
[03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:39.920]  years and now they're talking about a driver's license for the internet where if you make a
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:47.440]  comment that's reported maybe it's offensive maybe anti-government you will be deducted points
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:54.480]  on your internet license leading to maybe cutting off your web access all together and other
[03:11:54.480 --> 03:12:00.160]  punishments which we'll get on to i'm going to flip back to this story but look what we reported
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:08.080]  back in 2010 enemies of free speech call for internet licensing again this was over five years ago
[03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:15.040]  calls to introduce a licensing system to police the internet on behalf of a powerful un agency
[03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:19.680]  represent the latest salvo in a long-running battle to kill free speech on the web
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:25.920]  and bring an end to the powerful digital democracy that has devastated the carbon tax agenda of the
[03:12:25.920 --> 03:12:32.400]  un by exposing the climate gate scandal this was back when that was a huge story un international
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:38.880]  telecommunications union secretary hamadoon torey told the world economic forum in davos
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:44.480]  that global treaties need to be enacted in the name of stopping cyber warfare again it's always in
[03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:50.960]  the name of stopping cyber warfare craig monday chief research and strategy officer for microsoft
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:55.600]  told fellow globalists at the summit that the internet needed to be policed by means of
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:13:03.520]  introducing licenses similar to drivers licenses in other words government permission to use the
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:10.960]  web the exact same system now being implemented by the communist chinese party and if you think
[03:13:10.960 --> 03:13:18.160]  that could never happen over here in the glorious bountiful freedom of the west then just look what
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:25.040]  we reported two months ago x starzy agent hired to censor xenophobic facebook posts again people
[03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:31.680]  who make offensive facebook posts against the arriving influx of migrants who are you know
[03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:38.960]  defecating on people's gardens raping women stealing from local stores if you criticize the
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:44.080]  migrants and again some of these posts are you know calling for violence some of them aren't
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:49.840]  some of them are just considered quote racist which is obviously a very flexible standard
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:55.200]  depending on your definition so they hired an x starzy agent to work with the german government
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:14:01.360]  to work with facebook to hunt down these people making quote offensive facebook posts about
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:08.240]  about migrants and again we reported two months ago the un wants to censor the entire internet
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:14.320]  to save feminist feelings so these two prominent feminists got up in front of the un and eats a
[03:14:14.320 --> 03:14:21.360]  sarkeesian and zoe quinn and said basically if you say quote you suck to a feminist on twitter
[03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:28.880]  that's hate speech and you need to be censored off the internet for daring to utter that dissent
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:36.720]  another example they gave was calling katlyn jenna bruce that was enough for this program which
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:41.520]  they're still pushing thankfully it was rolled back because it was so authoritarian to get the
[03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:48.320]  un to pressure local governments to then pressure isps to hunt down and censor people if they may
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:53.200]  hate speech posts on the internet again what do they define as hate speech
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:15:00.400]  disagreeing with them that's hate speech or calling katlyn katlyn jenna bruce daring to
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:06.640]  challenge the orthodoxy of this whole transgender mental illness that they're pushing so yeah
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:11.600]  yes it already is happening over here we had another article just last year out of tech dirt
[03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:17.280]  the u.s. government begins rollout of its driver's license for the internet again the exact same
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:23.680]  words used for this chinese communist party system a few years ago and we report on this at the time
[03:15:23.680 --> 03:15:29.440]  the white house had a brilliant idea why not create a single secure online id that americans
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:36.320]  could use to verify their identity across multiple websites starting with local government services
[03:15:36.320 --> 03:15:42.320]  the new york times described it as a driver's license for the internet so this was a plan
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:47.840]  being pushed back at least in 2010 and even before that we had john mccain and lieberman
[03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:54.080]  and others call for a similar system whereby your real identity would be connected to every
[03:15:54.080 --> 03:16:01.680]  single comment you made on an internet post every single video you uploaded basically your entire
[03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:10.160]  browsing activity on the internet and now communist china is implementing that very system and its
[03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:17.280]  critics are calling it totalitarianism now just listen to the punishments that will ensue if you
[03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:23.600]  dare dissent if you did their group points on your driver's license for the internet again going
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:30.880]  back to the daily caller article as the name implies the system holds a score on every citizen
[03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:37.200]  and business based on their social behavior the things you buy and people people you socialize with
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:44.080]  are subject for review every word typed and posted on the internet will decide whether a person is
[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:52.160]  quote raising the honest mentality and credit levels of the entire society of course this is
[03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:58.560]  communism this is collectivism based on how these behaviors are in sync with the beliefs of the chinese
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:04.800]  communist party a person's score will go up and down the credit rating is directly related to a
[03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:11.680]  person's access to social services such as education and health care when a person runs out of points
[03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:17.680]  all together they will no longer be allowed to leave their homes so they're talking about
[03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:24.000]  withdrawing people's benefits maybe it will even get to the point where you know your your credit
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:30.240]  card simply ceases to work because you've dissented against the government on the internet that is
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:36.960]  the system that the communist chinese party is now trying to impose but what makes it even more
[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:44.240]  frightening is it's the same system that the u.s. government you know under a lighter fluffier
[03:17:44.240 --> 03:17:49.440]  description but to all intents and purposes the same system has been trying to impose
[03:17:49.440 --> 03:17:57.280]  for six seven eight years under the justification of cyber security they want your real id your full
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:04.480]  name linked to every single post you make on the internet and then you will be denied government
[03:18:04.480 --> 03:18:11.680]  services based on your fealty based on your submission to whatever the dominant narrative is
[03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:17.600]  and you know if you make anti migrant remarks for example as is already happening in germany
[03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:24.960]  then maybe you won't get your next welfare check which is obviously the ultimate means of control
[03:18:24.960 --> 03:18:30.800]  is to deprive people of their basic financial resources especially if they're living close
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:36.320]  to the bread line simply if they make negative facebook posts negative comments on articles
[03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:41.040]  about the government so this is absolutely chilling and it's why i brought it up first
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:48.640]  because about a month ago we also had the story of this app this new app that was about to come
[03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:56.400]  out which was basically yelp for people this was an app to rate and to review individual people
[03:18:56.400 --> 03:19:02.400]  based on their behavior whether it be in business personal relationships whatever
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:08.160]  and of course there was a huge outcry over this because who knows if it's true what people are
[03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:13.520]  posting about you on the internet if you know if it's a jilted lover or whatever then obviously
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:19.360]  they're going to be bitter they're going to give you as an individual person a negative review
[03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:23.520]  they're going to write bad things about you on the internet so they actually came out with
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:29.360]  this app called people and it received a huge backlash because it was obviously wide open
[03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:35.520]  to abuse now the founder of that and this relates back to the chinese issue because that's what
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:41.040]  they're talking about introducing basically yelp for people co-founder this is an article out of
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:47.360]  entrepreneur dot com your hate only fuels my resolve to launch people so despite the massive
[03:19:47.360 --> 03:19:53.200]  backlash they've resolved to relaunch this app and we'll get more into this after the break with
[03:19:53.200 --> 03:20:04.320]  your calls it's the alex jones show live stay tuned earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power
[03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:10.000]  outages or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:14.400]  we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the need for water
[03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:19.840]  but if you consider heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for
[03:20:19.840 --> 03:20:25.280]  you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane
[03:20:25.280 --> 03:20:30.480]  but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:35.280]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:40.400]  there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly

[03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:44.560]  lot of people so we're going to get some today we're going to go to these calls now because
[03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:49.200]  they've been waiting a long time ronnie in texas wants to talk about political correctness you're
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:55.680]  on the ad ronnie go ahead well i'm so honored to hear now say god blessed our uh phyllis
[03:25:55.680 --> 03:26:00.480]  shaftley who for many decades as you know has done more to help save our once proud constitutional
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:06.720]  u.s constitutional republic than anyone short of perhaps alex jones or of course dr ron paul but
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:15.280]  about uh briefly my opinion about dr rand paul is trump's best choice for vice president or
[03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:22.720]  vice versa my preference because that guarantees that trump or dr rand paul won't be assassinated
[03:26:22.720 --> 03:26:27.920]  i mean the evil one is can't they don't want to risk that either one of those people in the white
[03:26:27.920 --> 03:26:35.680]  house but uh again former president bill criminal he personally drove me away from the so-called
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:41.280]  democratic party many many years ago and you know about the pc i'm not personally a registered
[03:26:41.280 --> 03:26:47.760]  student at ut but i was thrown i was thrown off campus for just carrying my own omnipresent
[03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:54.080]  dr ron paul placard now what where's the first amendment fit into that i mean it's so counter to
[03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:59.440]  our you know right to express our political opinion that's what the first amendment is all about
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:06.080]  that and religion of course we're free to have our own you know to not be uh bullied out of our
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:10.960]  own religious beliefs or bullied out of our political beliefs but then again that doesn't
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:18.160]  seem to apply to the mighty university of texas anymore which is uh really uh horrific i uh it's
[03:27:18.160 --> 03:27:23.280]  a big letdown to me personally because i'm a lifelong many decades have been a follower of
[03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:29.840]  dr ron paul and he of course understands the constitution and if uh more people will just
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:36.640]  pay attention to uh the idea is that dr ron paul has been uh spreading for many many years
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:43.840]  as many many books and they'll pay attention to hopefully dr rand paul uh as as the best choice
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:48.080]  as uh in my personal opinion i think he's the best choice for president but if it's
[03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:54.320]  going to be trump i think trump would do himself a a a guarantee to not be assassinated if he had
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:28:00.560]  dr ron dr rand paul on the ticket with him i think that'd be an excellent choice ronnie and
[03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:06.160]  thanks for the call and yeah again you mentioned you were kicked out of university for carrying a
[03:28:06.160 --> 03:28:13.120]  ron or a rand paul book because we had the footage last week out of project veritas at Yale Cornell
[03:28:13.120 --> 03:28:20.560]  Syracuse, Versailles and Oberlin where they posed to students who who were triggered by a pocket
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:27.440]  constitution and they actually got the administrators at these universities to rip up copies of the
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:34.880]  pocket constitution simply because it offended because it had triggered the precious snowflakes
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:40.880]  and of course it was set up but it was illustrating how these university professors are now so afraid
[03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:46.160]  of their extreme left-wing students that they will go to any lengths to count out of them
[03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:50.640]  also before the breakouts took him out china of course they're implementing this censorship
[03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:57.440]  policy via the internet we had the professor there at the other university yale surrounded by
[03:28:57.440 --> 03:29:03.840]  this hate mob because he dared to suggest that halloween costumes might not be offensive if you
[03:29:03.840 --> 03:29:10.080]  just ignored them and got the hell over it he was surrounded by this paying mob alex talked about
[03:29:10.080 --> 03:29:16.480]  that on yesterday's show now actually turns out that that very kind of behavior is straight out of
[03:29:16.480 --> 03:29:22.640]  red china there's an article out of bright bar which documents that it's a form of public shaming
[03:29:22.640 --> 03:29:27.920]  in which perceived enemies of the party would be surrounded in a public place by red gods this is
[03:29:27.920 --> 03:29:33.840]  what happened during the cultural revolution maus most zealous supporters the red gods pearl abuse
[03:29:33.840 --> 03:29:38.320]  at their target until they confess to their crimes so we're going to get more into the whole

[03:31:11.920 --> 03:31:18.080]  children are hit with modern mind control television music fast food gmo's sugars you name it young

[03:33:01.360 --> 03:33:07.920]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:33:07.920 --> 03:33:18.320]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:33:18.320 --> 03:33:22.160]  well back it's the fourth hour overdrive of the alex jones show we're going to go tomorrow
[03:33:22.160 --> 03:33:26.880]  with your calls here in about 10 minutes but obviously the top story this hour it was the
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:33.760]  top story on drudgereport.com as of about an hour ago the president of the university of Missouri
[03:33:33.760 --> 03:33:40.560]  has basically been forced to step down he's been forced to resign for little more than being white
[03:33:41.280 --> 03:33:46.400]  now of course this controversy has been rumbling for a few months now but president tim wolf had
[03:33:46.400 --> 03:33:53.440]  made the announcement today after again another baying mob Maoist style as i explained in the
[03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:59.920]  in the previous segment demanded that he acknowledge his white privilege in the aftermath of less than
[03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:06.640]  a handful of alleged racist incidents which occurred at the university over the last few months
[03:34:06.640 --> 03:34:12.320]  so again let's get this clear the president who has been forced to resign because of this
[03:34:12.320 --> 03:34:20.080]  regressive leftist purge against all free speech which is now enveloping universities across america
[03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:26.720]  again we saw it with project veritas we've seen other universities wisconsin even say that using
[03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:33.040]  the term politically correct is politically incorrect it's a war on free speech and this
[03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:39.840]  president who's been forced to resign made no racist comments whatsoever he performed no racist
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:48.000]  actions whatsoever his crime was refusing to kowtow to the Maoist style intimidation tactics
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:55.520]  of this ideological lynch mob so they had a few incidents over the last few months back in september
[03:34:55.520 --> 03:35:01.520]  a white student well yelled a racial slur at the university's black student body president
[03:35:01.520 --> 03:35:07.360]  then there was another incident where this drunk white student again yelled a racial insult at
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:14.080]  another black student someone drew a swastika with feces on a bathroom wall again a lot of
[03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:19.120]  those incidents have been proven to be false flags where they're actually performed by the
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:24.240]  people who live in permanent victimhood to try and smear their ideological adversaries we don't
[03:35:24.240 --> 03:35:29.680]  know for sure what happened so they're a handful of allegedly racist incidents that occurred again
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:37.040]  the president made no racist comment whatsoever he simply refused to get out of his vehicle and meet
[03:35:37.040 --> 03:35:43.920]  with this baying mob that wanted to shout him down the football team which again is majority black
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:49.200]  and one of their complaints is there aren't enough black staff on the faculty there at the
[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:55.120]  university even though the football team is majority black so again no positive discrimination there
[03:35:55.840 --> 03:36:00.560]  but they basically forced him to resign because they demanded he acknowledge his quote white
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:07.840]  privilege and refused to do so so as ben Shapiro writes today wolf was ousted for refusing to
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:15.360]  acknowledge his white male privilege a privilege that apparently includes being fired for no reason
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:21.360]  because of this color of his skin and his sex and that the school hire more black teachers
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:27.440]  based solely on the color of their skin so white privilege is so amazing now apparently
[03:36:28.400 --> 03:36:35.600]  that people are getting fired or being forced to step down for being white that's how much of an
[03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:43.520]  advantage white privilege was in this case again the university's undergraduate population is 79
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:49.680]  percent white and 8 percent black which is almost in line with the state population 83 percent white
[03:36:49.680 --> 03:36:57.600]  and nearly 12 percent black and again they were worried about their precious safe space they were
[03:36:57.600 --> 03:37:04.400]  worried about being triggered by these alleged incidents they demanded that heads must roll
[03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:10.080]  but because this university president not only failed to take responsibility for actions that were
[03:37:10.080 --> 03:37:16.240]  nothing to do with him and because he failed to acknowledge his quote white privilege now the
[03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:22.800]  being mob the regressive left has forced him to resign and they're actually forming human
[03:37:22.800 --> 03:37:29.680]  shields around the university to prevent reporters from getting near to report on the story again
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:36.560]  illustrating their total contempt for the free press and for free speech and to getting you
[03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:41.120]  know to the heart of what this issue actually actually represents so again it's about this
[03:37:41.120 --> 03:37:48.640]  being mob of professionally offended special snowflakes that demand not equality but supremacy
[03:37:49.280 --> 03:37:55.840]  demand somebody apologize for the color of their skin their racists their regressives
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:38:01.840]  they don't believe in equality and on the subject of white privilege now we got this marked ice video
[03:38:01.840 --> 03:38:08.480]  liberals enthusiastically back fake msnbc reporters call for white privilege tax liberals
[03:38:08.480 --> 03:38:15.280]  in san diego enthusiastically back to fake msnbc reporters call for a white privilege tax in order
[03:38:15.280 --> 03:38:23.120]  to redistribute wealth to minority communities here's the video to demonstrate how most people
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:29.680]  will mindlessly believe what the mainstream media tells them i'm here posing as a reporter for msnbc
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:35.040]  where i'm going to be making up some insane news to see if the people blindly believe it
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:40.640]  president obama's new white privilege tax for income redistribution to invest money in the
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:46.000]  minority communities think it's about time he do that yeah i think um yeah i think it's my
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:50.720]  turn for him to do that because you know i mean everybody needs a little help he's a little
[03:38:50.720 --> 03:38:56.240]  handout he's a little handout and uh the minorities uh they're struggling and um white people have
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:01.600]  more money you know so they the white privilege tax so just kind of even thing even the playing
[03:39:01.600 --> 03:39:08.720]  field out a little bit you think yes yes it does yes i really think so because uh they uh the rich
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:14.640]  they have white people well you know the rich that they have the money the white people have the
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:20.000]  money to um to put in the programs to fund the programs they're putting them in a different
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:25.680]  organization so the minority tax is a good thing basically is what you're saying and make sure the
[03:39:25.680 --> 03:39:31.760]  minority get the money to to benefit themselves from the white guys okay just checking the the idea
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:38.480]  is that since the white people make a disproportionately higher amount of money the white privilege
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:43.920]  tax would just sort of help to offset that right and make everything a little bit more even you
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:49.760]  think that's long overdue i guess so but you know at the end of the day it's a capitalist society so
[03:39:49.760 --> 03:39:54.880]  it's you know white penalized people for making more money per se but it's more of like a bonus
[03:39:54.880 --> 03:39:59.600]  right you know if you're if you're making that much money years you're sort of rewarded with
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:05.440]  the white privilege no i i get that for sure yeah it's it's almost you know uh just a good way to
[03:40:05.440 --> 03:40:11.200]  spread the wealth into the minority communities from the from the higher and white communities
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:15.440]  right about time we do something like that i'd say so i mean there's there's a lot i'd say
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:19.840]  millionaires with money in the bank that isn't touched when white people yes per se but uh
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:24.160]  yeah i wouldn't say it's distribute that money into the minority community is a good thing it's
[03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:27.920]  a good thing yes sir yeah i would say so all right for sure i'm just getting people to comment
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:34.720]  go go tax thank you the white privilege tax program to help with the income redistribution
[03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:40.480]  hints of minority communities the exciting new program just getting people's comments on this
[03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:46.080]  amazing new program i don't know the details of that specific program but obviously there needs
[03:40:46.080 --> 03:40:52.720]  to be redistribution of wealth but this typically is on a little slightly higher taxation on the
[03:40:52.720 --> 03:40:58.240]  Caucasian since they make a lot more money uh huh take that money and invest it in minority
[03:40:58.240 --> 03:41:03.280]  communities great idea yeah absolutely if you look at a study that was done by the fed of san
[03:41:03.280 --> 03:41:09.760]  francisco uh so we are the 17th country in the world uh based on if you're an if you have any
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:16.160]  ethnicity or any problems financially to rise up to the top and the white people have the money so
[03:41:16.160 --> 03:41:24.160]  they can afford to pay a little bit higher taxes exactly exactly here at msnbc we couldn't agree
[03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:28.720]  more thank you so much for your time have a great day appreciate that should president
[03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:33.920]  obama have issued the white tax years ago white privilege tax video again he's done that before
[03:41:33.920 --> 03:41:39.920]  with hillary clinton supporters and they enthusiastically advocated it too and again it goes
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:47.360]  back to the point i was making before progressives don't believe inequality they'll openly call for
[03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:54.160]  people to be discriminated against based on their skin color as we saw in this video and that's
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:42:00.240]  otherwise known as racism but again they've they've launched this pseudo-intellectual thinking
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:06.560]  they've invented it out of fresh air where they claim that it's impossible to be racist against
[03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:12.800]  white people because to be racist has to combine prejudice with power of course the vast majority
[03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:18.240]  of white people in america have no power whatsoever but that's the only way liberals can win the
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:24.960]  argument they literally have to change the meaning of words to suit their narrative and again we saw
[03:42:24.960 --> 03:42:30.720]  it in that video let's go to more of your calls here jim in connecticut wants to talk about pc
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:37.840]  culture jim you're on the air go ahead uh yeah i had experience at alo garden recently um it was
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:44.000]  about they got these ipads now on the tables where you can order stuff but i looked at them and i
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  noticed that there's cameras on both sides so uh because this is going on earlier into what
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:43:00.800]  well alice was saying before you got off there explain that again jerry's what not well i had a
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:06.480]  couple of minutes ago i went to alo garden with my options say and they had these ipods where you
[03:43:06.480 --> 03:43:13.840]  can order stuff but i noticed that the ipads i should say had uh the cameras were still in them
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:21.760]  and more likely were probably active whatnot and there right there was not culture in my book now
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:26.320]  yeah we've had that story before we had it a couple of weeks ago in another restaurant and they
[03:43:26.320 --> 03:43:29.840]  they were confronted about it the staff and the owners of the restaurant and they were
[03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:34.480]  wishing washy about it saying well yeah the cameras might be activated but you can opt out of
[03:43:34.480 --> 03:43:40.080]  course nobody knew that when they sat down at the table so it's it's creepy beyond belief thanks for
[03:43:40.080 --> 03:43:46.080]  the call jim another story i wanted to cover before we get to more of these callers here this
[03:43:46.080 --> 03:43:52.960]  is out of louder with crowded calm again talking about how political correctness is now literally
[03:43:52.960 --> 03:44:02.880]  putting people's lives at risk woman hired to fdny despite failing all physical tests because
[03:44:02.880 --> 03:44:10.080]  because sjw equality again nothing to do with equality this is actually putting people's
[03:44:10.080 --> 03:44:16.240]  lives at risk we've seen this before they get women who take these physical courses to try and
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:24.560]  become a firefighter and they fail time and time again now hiring people who can't do the job because
[03:44:24.560 --> 03:44:31.040]  they're physically inept to save people from fires that's a threat that's going to cost lives in the
[03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:36.560]  long run and the article says i'm a reasonable person the best person for the job matters more
[03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:44.720]  to me than skin color or gender again we live in a meritocracy let's pick people for the job
[03:44:44.720 --> 03:44:51.360]  based on their skills and talent not on their skin color let's not be racist the article
[03:44:51.360 --> 03:44:56.720]  continues but i understand why having a diverse workforce is a nice idea we are all the world
[03:44:56.720 --> 03:45:04.000]  and all still you should at least be able to do the job unlike a new fdny hire that needed
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:11.360]  instructors to fudge results all in the name of diversity so this is a woman who took this
[03:45:11.360 --> 03:45:17.680]  physical course to become a firefighter and quote never achieved a passing score of 17 minutes and
[03:45:17.680 --> 03:45:25.680]  50 seconds on the functional skills test a course of job related tasks in full gear such as stretching
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:32.400]  hoses and dragging dummies according to an fdny source familiar with the training she did not come
[03:45:32.400 --> 03:45:40.800]  in under 24 minutes in practice tests it continues she also failed to run the required 1.5 miles in
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:47.840]  12 minutes or less even after the running course was slashed by an estimated quarter mile so they
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:55.120]  even reduced the standards of the test and she still failed the source said alleging that the
[03:45:55.120 --> 03:45:59.440]  start and finish lines were moved to shorten the run so even after they shortened the run she still
[03:45:59.440 --> 03:46:07.120]  failed but she was one of 282 co-ordered priority hires those are the words they use priority
[03:46:07.120 --> 03:46:15.360]  hires a judge commanded must get preference because of quote past discrimination yes this is a real
[03:46:15.360 --> 03:46:20.640]  thing this means that when it comes to a life and death situation when you need someone to drag your
[03:46:20.640 --> 03:46:26.640]  limp body from a burning building when you need someone to dive back into said building to save
[03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:33.200]  your baby in record time you may not get the best person for the job instead of a strapping young
[03:46:33.200 --> 03:46:40.160]  physically capable fireman you may instead see a gender fluid pansexual bantam weight
[03:46:40.160 --> 03:46:46.720]  waltzing in to save you so they're actually giving jobs to people to become firefighters
[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:53.280]  not based on their proficiency not based on whether they've got the skills to pass the physical test
[03:46:53.280 --> 03:47:00.240]  to get the job but based on their gender and of course that is going to lead to absolute disaster
[03:47:00.240 --> 03:47:06.080]  when there's a fire when you need someone who's physically capable to save lives and they're
[03:47:06.080 --> 03:47:11.600]  unable to do so because the standards for passing these this test have been lowered to such an extent
[03:47:11.600 --> 03:47:19.920]  that basically anyone can get the job again another example of political correctness now
[03:47:19.920 --> 03:47:26.880]  actually set to put people's lives at risk let's go back to these calls we've got tim in wyoming
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:34.160]  on pc culture tim you're on the air go ahead yes hi hi you were talking about the political
[03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:39.200]  correctness when you mentioned china earlier you're saying something about five years ago
[03:47:39.200 --> 03:47:44.240]  they were talking about the uh having having people surrounded just that happened to me
[03:47:44.240 --> 03:47:50.720]  when i went to a meeting of uh un supporters amazingly enough well i mean not really surprising
[03:47:50.720 --> 03:47:57.840]  but when i went to a meeting of un supporters actually as an anti-un um representative and
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:01.840]  i was surrounded literally by people who were yelling and screaming and telling me that the
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:07.040]  organization i belong to was uh most likely communist and they were saying that the un was
[03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:11.760]  great and everything and i just couldn't understand their way of thinking they were impossibly
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:17.760]  impossibly disconnected from reality it was it was it was it was funny actually i mean
[03:48:17.760 --> 03:48:22.640]  i thought about it afterwards and i thought i should have laughed in their faces but i did so
[03:48:23.760 --> 03:48:29.360]  but no i mean that tactic of surrounding people as part of a baying mob intimidating them you know
[03:48:29.360 --> 03:48:35.440]  under the guise of just having a back and forth conversation that's actually a malice tactic
[03:48:35.440 --> 03:48:40.880]  practiced by the red gods it's in this bright bar article you can read about it we posted it up on
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:45.920]  info wars dot com it's called only conservatives can save the american campus but should we and
[03:48:45.920 --> 03:48:50.720]  obviously it's talking about what alex covered yesterday which was this individual this professor
[03:48:50.720 --> 03:48:57.440]  at yale university who had the temerity to send out an email suggesting that people shouldn't get
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:05.040]  offended over quote offensive halloween costumes so he was surrounded by this baying of leftists
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:11.840]  who again in most cases are more extreme than their professors even were back in the 60s basically
[03:49:11.840 --> 03:49:18.160]  screaming demanding he resign for daring to say that people should not be so sensitive about
[03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:23.120]  halloween costumes and again from this article it says students of history will notice an alarming
[03:49:23.120 --> 03:49:28.960]  similarity in the video which we played yesterday to the struggle sessions of malice china a form
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:34.160]  of public shaming in which perceived enemies of the party would be surrounded in a public place by
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:40.720]  red gods mouse mouse zealous supporters the red gods would hurl abuse at their target until they
[03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:46.480]  confess to their crimes uninformed critics might argue that the red gods were a weapon of the
[03:49:46.480 --> 03:49:52.560]  communist state and not genuine grassroots movement but they'd be wrong the red god started out as a
[03:49:52.560 --> 03:50:00.240]  student movement on chinese campuses so they use these exact same tactics to surround this professor
[03:50:00.240 --> 03:50:07.120]  to intimidate him to shout him down by the end of the video one student was screaming her head off
[03:50:07.120 --> 03:50:13.200]  and running away simply because he sent out an email saying these halloween costumes were offensive
[03:50:13.200 --> 03:50:19.520]  which we've seen that narrative being pushed by the huffington post by mtv i made a video about it
[03:50:20.080 --> 03:50:26.480]  and so now again these regressive leftists are using that to try and take control of university
[03:50:26.480 --> 03:50:33.840]  campuses which are supposed to be bastions of free speech bastions of unrestricted debate
[03:50:33.840 --> 03:50:40.080]  they're not supposed to be safe spaces where you have to get trigger warnings before anything that
[03:50:40.080 --> 03:50:45.760]  might offend somebody so now again these liberal professors we can quite you know radical back
[03:50:45.760 --> 03:50:51.360]  in the 60s are so afraid of their students that they're actually asking to be transferred and
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:56.000]  quitting these universities that's how bad it's got we'll delve more into it after the break it's the

[03:53:10.720 --> 03:53:15.360]  same thing we start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered

[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:36.240]  a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time
[03:53:36.240 --> 03:53:42.560]  when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers

[03:54:20.640 --> 03:54:27.040]  power overdrive of the alex jones show david night's going to tell us what's coming up on tonight's
[03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:31.360]  info wars nightly news david what have you got for us tonight well paul we're going to be talking
[03:54:31.360 --> 03:54:35.520]  in an extended interview to roger stone of course alex talked to him earlier today on the radio
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:39.920]  show he's a former advisor to donald trump and of course he's been a political consultant to
[03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:46.080]  pretty much all the presidents since and including richard nixon so he's got a very long history a
[03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:50.640]  lot of experience he breaks down where we are in this particular race talks about the issues and
[03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:56.640]  most importantly about his book hillary clinton's war on women and he's written a couple of other
[03:54:56.640 --> 03:55:00.800]  books he's got another book that is coming out just before the new hampshire primaries we talked
[03:55:00.800 --> 03:55:05.840]  to him about that a little bit jeb and the bush crime family so that's going to be very interesting
[03:55:05.840 --> 03:55:11.360]  we also will be covering the resumé gate about ben carson what's up with that of course there's a
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:17.280]  pretended illusion of objectivity of the media that exposed that that's not anywhere near the
[03:55:17.280 --> 03:55:22.080]  case but we're also going to talk about how the public has been taken captive by this left right
[03:55:22.080 --> 03:55:27.600]  paradigm and we're also going to talk paul about this missile test off the coast of california near
[03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:31.600]  la what does that tell us what are the implications of that missile test we're going to talk about
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:38.960]  that tonight on the nightly news okay and you can see that by subscribing to prisonplanet.tv
[03:55:38.960 --> 03:55:45.520]  see it first in high quality obviously later it goes up on the alex joneshow channel that's the
[03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:50.560]  info wars nightly news a couple of stories i just want to hit here in the final few minutes because
[03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:58.240]  alex touched on this earlier german town migrants riot in church steal from stores defecate on gardens
[03:55:58.240 --> 03:56:06.640]  this is yet another quiet german town population 23 500 that was inundated by four and half thousand
[03:56:06.640 --> 03:56:14.080]  asylum seekers and now basically people are afraid to even go into the town because of the aggressive
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:21.680]  intimidating behavior of these refugees who have not been integrated they're stealing from stores
[03:56:21.680 --> 03:56:27.680]  again there are more reports of rape defecating on people's gardens showing no respect for the
[03:56:27.680 --> 03:56:32.240]  local culture which of course has been in place for hundreds and hundreds of years a strong catholic
[03:56:32.240 --> 03:56:39.120]  community and we're seeing this all over germany this is a continuing problem especially with the
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:44.320]  rape cases which the police are again being caught covering up they refuse to divulge details
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:51.600]  brightbox reporting germany to lower education standards for benefit of migrants the german
[03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:55.920]  interior minister has announced his intention to drop educational standards in the country
[03:56:55.920 --> 03:57:02.160]  to help migrants get into school or find a training place so now they're actually going to go
[03:57:02.160 --> 03:57:07.920]  you know common core with their education system lower the standards simply to appease and to absorb
[03:57:07.920 --> 03:57:14.000]  these migrants with overflowing classroom sizes of course that's going to negatively impact the
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:19.440]  country in a different way to all the other social problems that they're importing via this mass
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:26.640]  wave of migrants finally here in the last minute gate stone institute reports germany migration
[03:57:26.640 --> 03:57:33.040]  crisis becomes public health crisis german hospitals are increasing security to protect
[03:57:33.040 --> 03:57:38.640]  doctors and nurses from violent attacks by migrants who are unhappy with the medical treatment
[03:57:38.640 --> 03:57:42.800]  they're receiving we've seen in the other camps they're unhappy with the wi-fi they're unhappy
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:47.600]  with the food now they're complaining about the medical treatment being given to them free at
[03:57:47.600 --> 03:57:53.600]  taxpayer expense and they're actually attacking doctors and nurses these hospitals are trying to
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:57:59.040]  hire extra security to deal with this we've also got doctors warning about the fact that these
[03:57:59.040 --> 03:58:05.680]  migrants are importing all these exotic diseases into the country that had been eradicated ebola
[03:58:05.680 --> 03:58:13.360]  being one of them potentially also several tb cases hemorrhagic fever diphtheria ebola hepatitis
[03:58:13.360 --> 03:58:19.360]  malaria measles all these different illnesses being imported back into the country it's a massive
[03:58:19.360 --> 03:58:23.520]  crisis and that's why germany is currently in revolt the top security ministers are warning
[03:58:23.520 --> 03:58:30.000]  about domestic unrest and basically trying to try anglomercal for treason because it's all
[03:58:30.000 --> 03:58:34.400]  her fault that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the alex jones show stay tuned
