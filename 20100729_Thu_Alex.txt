[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:34.960]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us it is Thursday the 29th day of July 2010 we
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.920]  have a power-packed transmission lined up for you today a member of the Icelandic
[00:40.920 --> 00:45.680]  Parliament Brigitte Jones-Dottier who we're a big fan of and who has done great
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.840]  work fighting the bankers over there is going to join us she's got a lot of
[00:48.840 --> 00:53.480]  inside info on WikiLeaks and we're still trying to gauge the exact nature of
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.680]  this she's joining us for 40 minutes in the next hour then we have Ray McGovern
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.040]  popping in for 30 on WikiLeaks but more importantly we're going to spend most of
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.840]  our time with the former high-level CIA analyst Reagan and Bush senior talking
[01:06.840 --> 01:10.920]  about the green lighting of an attack on Iran is it a full green light are they
[01:10.920 --> 01:18.560]  preparing to green light it we'll get his intel from DC coming up then after
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.680]  that the last 30 minutes of the third hour we're going to have Phil Berg the
[01:23.680 --> 01:30.280]  lawyer the father of the Berther movement will be joining us as well to
[01:30.280 --> 01:34.920]  give us updates on those issues but in the first hour in 20 minutes of the
[01:34.920 --> 01:38.880]  broadcast today for this hour and 20 minutes into the next before Brigitte
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.560]  joins us it is just a total information overload of key information on so many
[01:45.560 --> 01:51.080]  fronts and I will cover all of these stacks I have but first off I was
[01:51.080 --> 01:56.600]  browsing info wars.com further down the page and reading articles that we had
[01:56.600 --> 02:02.120]  linked to in the last three or four days that I hadn't had time to look at and I
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.440]  saw one about raids on health food stores in Southern California and I
[02:07.440 --> 02:14.120]  watched the surveillance camera footage of a health food store selling goat milk
[02:14.120 --> 02:19.040]  that you can buy right here in Austin and they raided them with guns and we're
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.880]  screaming at them and pointing guns at people at a health food store at hippies
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.080]  that wouldn't hurt a fly and it just illustrates how out of control the
[02:29.080 --> 02:33.000]  federal and state governments are this was a federal slash state slash local
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.560]  police raid and it just got me so hot so that is going to be coming up later in
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.760]  this hour there's no audio on the video but it's linked up on info wars.com
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.960]  over prisonplanet.tv viewers will be playing the surveillance camera footage
[02:47.960 --> 02:51.400]  and for radio listeners I'll be describing it but you can go to info wars.com
[02:51.400 --> 03:00.400]  and go to the story from the Los Angeles times headline raw food raid
[03:00.400 --> 03:10.680]  highlights a hunger and I'm seeing reports like this around the country every
[03:10.680 --> 03:15.640]  week or two where you'll have a family of farmers selling eggs and watermelons
[03:15.640 --> 03:20.640]  out on the side of the road and they send an undercover officer to buy eggs and
[03:20.640 --> 03:27.200]  watermelons and they arrest them for not supposedly paying sales tax or they
[03:27.200 --> 03:31.760]  arrest them for selling eggs or milk or cheese or they raid their homes and
[03:31.760 --> 03:36.520]  they're they're harassing the Amish now and it just illustrates the fact that
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.880]  Prudential and other insurance companies are in a detailed Bloomberg report
[03:41.880 --> 03:47.880]  gotta say I don't like Mayor Bloomberg but I really like Bloomberg his company
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.360]  I mean the news they the investigative reports they put out dwarf anything I'm
[03:52.360 --> 03:56.440]  seeing in the world and time and time again they report things we already know
[03:56.440 --> 04:02.000]  but they're the only mainstream outlet to detail it and it's how Prudential and
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.600]  others are swindling and it's admittedly illegal they take out insurance
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.600]  policies on troops and then when the troops get killed they don't even pay
[04:11.600 --> 04:15.800]  any of the insurance of the families and they send them a letter to basically
[04:15.800 --> 04:21.360]  steal the money from them to manipulate them and then now that they might pay a
[04:21.360 --> 04:24.800]  fine that's a tiny fraction it's not just Prudential it's others according to
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.200]  Bloomberg it just these banks and insurance companies are criminals and
[04:30.200 --> 04:34.960]  they run the government they're the ones setting up this whole new world order so
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.800]  so that's coming up I also have talked a lot in the last decade about Google
[04:39.800 --> 04:46.920]  being an NSA front and actually being a crystal ball to tell the future that's
[04:46.920 --> 04:50.480]  not my words I've read that in declassified Pentagon documents but
[04:50.480 --> 04:54.840]  here it is in Wired magazine today Google openly announces they can tell the
[04:54.840 --> 05:01.760]  future we'll be right back stay with us my folks this is Alex Jones asking you

[08:56.880 --> 09:02.880]  next hour and 20 minutes or so before the guests start joining us today we've
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.080]  got a lot of news to cover and a short time to get there so let me just do
[09:07.080 --> 09:10.760]  this let me just read the headlines just the headlines and I'm gonna go back
[09:10.760 --> 09:14.400]  through it in more detail but just to give you an idea what we're dealing with
[09:14.400 --> 09:20.600]  White House proposal would ease FBI access to records of internet activity
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.560]  ISPs your personal computers everything no fourth amendment and it says right
[09:26.560 --> 09:32.640]  here in the first paragraph without warrants just the complete end of the
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.880]  fourth amendment and I was driving into work this morning in fact I'm tempted to
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.960]  call KLBJ 590 because I'm friends with them they carry the show and get them to
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.880]  get me that call that came in at about 1025 that we you guys call Thomas
[09:48.880 --> 09:52.800]  McDonald his number is in my phone he actually called me yesterday and call
[09:52.800 --> 09:57.640]  him and ask if he can MP3 us that lady saying I want to give up my liberty for
[09:57.640 --> 10:01.680]  freedom I want him I want the FBI to search all our computers this
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.240]  Constitution is bad it's going to allow the terrorists to attack us and we've
[10:08.240 --> 10:11.760]  got a you know let the government do whatever it wants and I just wanted to
[10:11.760 --> 10:15.680]  scream at her in fact I was actually yelling at the radio and telling her
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.320]  lady governments are always what is most dangerous this government is so
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.160]  corrupt has been caught lying so many times is run by such corrupt
[10:24.160 --> 10:28.480]  corporations that have hijacked it what are you talking about the entire
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.160]  Homeland Security apparatus was built and designed and is pointed at the
[10:34.160 --> 10:40.240]  American people that's on record but she is just the perfect example I've got to
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.920]  get that call I've got to get that call and play it here on air because she was
[10:44.920 --> 10:50.160]  just as stupid and mindless as the woman who I interviewed in London at a
[10:50.160 --> 10:55.320]  vegetable and fruit stand right outside one of the places that got bombed and I
[10:55.320 --> 11:01.080]  walk up to her and I talk about how the police had killed an innocent man just a
[11:01.080 --> 11:04.680]  few days after the attack execution style and she said well I think we should
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.600]  give up our liberty for freedom what an oxymoron this woman I heard today was
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.800]  even stupider than that and she illustrates everything we're fighting
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.160]  how these sheeple just love to be slaves but I'm sorry I should I'd read the
[11:18.160 --> 11:27.640]  headlines I'm already digressing here White House proposal would ease FBI
[11:27.640 --> 11:33.960]  access to records of internet activity and then you read the article it says
[11:33.960 --> 11:42.520]  no longer have any warrants look at this incredible Google story out of Wired
[11:42.520 --> 11:49.440]  magazine headline exclusive Google CIA invest in future of web monitoring in
[11:49.440 --> 11:55.840]  live time CIA tracking everything you do live time no warrants no nothing now
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.560]  listen to this first line I'm gonna get back into this later but how many times
[11:59.560 --> 12:03.280]  if you heard me talk about this word for word and I've gotten a lot of people
[12:03.280 --> 12:06.800]  making jokes about it on the web and saying I'm crazy they won't go research
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.840]  my facts they just say I'm lying the investment arm of the CIA in Kutel and
[12:11.840 --> 12:16.880]  Google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time and says
[12:16.880 --> 12:23.240]  it uses the information to predict the future that's what all of this is about
[12:23.240 --> 12:28.200]  RFID face scanning cameras they're already doing it they are already
[12:28.200 --> 12:34.160]  predicting mass movements to upwards of 99% and individual movements up to 93%
[12:34.160 --> 12:40.400]  and that's what they admit they know what you're gonna do before you do it
[12:40.400 --> 12:47.360]  that's what this is really all about and Google is the NSA here's another key
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.440]  article seven people have been entrusted with the keys to the entire
[12:51.440 --> 12:58.000]  internet seven people can bring down the entire domain system and shut the web
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.320]  off in a matter of seconds we're gonna be covering that also out of the NBC
[13:05.320 --> 13:11.800]  details of 100 million Facebook users published online Facebook had told them
[13:11.800 --> 13:15.800]  they would never share it if you wanted to be a private profile not any more
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.200]  because he thinks you're a bunch of dumb efforts remember that quote these dumb
[13:20.200 --> 13:28.040]  efforts think they can trust me they are such schmucks ha ha ha ha ha ha and of
[13:28.040 --> 13:32.240]  course Facebook is admittedly CIA Twitter is admittedly run by the State
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.520]  Department which is the international conglomerate arm of the CIA and it's
[13:36.520 --> 13:41.680]  just all about flaunting it in your face and trying to break your will here's
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.560]  another important report out of alternate has the most common marijuana test
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.320]  resulted in tens of thousands of wrongful convictions the answer is yes
[13:51.320 --> 14:00.280]  it's all quackery just like what we see going on with the old lie detector test
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.160]  and so they're now replacing those with brain scanners and predictive pre-crime
[14:05.160 --> 14:11.320]  systems so we'll be discussing all of that and curtain emo has got an
[14:11.320 --> 14:18.560]  excellent article that's up on info wars dot com right now that details this
[14:18.560 --> 14:26.680]  pre-crime so-called prediction system the problem is they can put any false
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.160]  data they want into this and falsely claim that the system predicted that
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.440]  you were going to commit a crime and and and that's the issue with this
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.120]  panopticon is that we know governments will abuse it we know the founding
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.480]  fathers warned us about this type of thing and we know that they've been
[14:43.480 --> 14:49.400]  caught putting out this info as well but Google and CIA fund political
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.360]  pre-crime technology is the curtain emo story that just went up on info wars
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.360]  dot com in the last 30 minutes and we're going to be going over that as well
[15:00.360 --> 15:06.320]  today in some of the other news document leak part of us plot says
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.560]  pakistani ex-general with ties to the Taliban the former head of pakistani
[15:10.560 --> 15:21.080]  intelligent hameed ghoul who again a year and a half ago came out and said
[15:21.080 --> 15:27.920]  that the west had staged the attacks in moon by the head of indian intelligence
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.200]  and said the same thing and low and behold a year later it came out in
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.800]  mainstream u.s. news indeed the commander of the people that attacked the shopping
[15:35.800 --> 15:45.080]  mall in moon by india were government agents from the united states so but
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.160]  again when that finally came out in the mainstream news it was just a mere blurb
[15:50.160 --> 15:56.360]  should have been the top story instead we know that google and others that are
[15:56.360 --> 16:02.480]  NSA fronts pump the web with basically fake top search terms like mel Gibson
[16:02.480 --> 16:09.240]  lindsey low hand lebron james they basically set the agenda for petty
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.640]  mindless issues is one of their other control systems i'm going to cover this
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.040]  more coming up later in the hour but for prison planet dot tv viewers let's just
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.760]  start playing some of that video for folks to be able to see it this is again
[16:23.760 --> 16:30.640]  linked up on info wars dot com raw food raids highlights a hunger some people
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.040]  balk at restrictions on selling unprocessed milk and other foods how can
[16:35.040 --> 16:39.280]  we not have the freedom to choose what we eat one says regulators say rules
[16:39.280 --> 16:46.280]  exist for safety and fairness and they come in to the health food store in the
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.120]  back door in their warehouse with their guns drawn and when they see the hippies
[16:51.120 --> 16:56.480]  in there at the health food store the officers point their guns at them and
[16:56.480 --> 17:03.360]  tell them get on the floor so they're gonna expand the drug war into your
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.440]  farms and ranches big big agris writing rules that will shut down all the small
[17:08.440 --> 17:13.360]  farms and ranches and just they've they've that they've rated farms that
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.680]  grow things like aloe vera saying it can supposedly get you high they want to
[17:18.680 --> 17:22.880]  make you have to get a prescription for vitamin c it's all part of codex
[17:22.880 --> 17:29.960]  alimentarius so that is coming up as well here's another one White House backs
[17:29.960 --> 17:34.760]  bill to collect employee pay information from all businesses the total
[17:34.760 --> 17:40.080]  tracking grid acts falls on national health services they're massively
[17:40.080 --> 17:45.720]  slashing all different types of surgeries basic health care eye surgeries

[18:15.840 --> 18:18.520]  mentioned this at the very start of the show we're gonna get some guests on
[18:18.520 --> 18:23.080]  about this in the next week because I'm really hot about this and I'd read about
[18:23.080 --> 18:33.120]  this here and there but this detailed 15 page report from Bloomberg is nothing
[18:33.120 --> 18:40.680]  less than stunning fallen soldiers families denied cash as insurers profit
[18:40.680 --> 18:47.360]  and then you read the article and it talks about how these insurance companies
[18:47.360 --> 18:54.520]  take out insurance on troops and then because they name the families as
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.560]  beneficiaries but write it up where they send them a blank checkbook saying
[18:58.560 --> 19:04.440]  here's your money it's in this account but then it's a fake checkbook when you
[19:04.440 --> 19:09.000]  go to cash him the money's not good and then they keep the money and they're
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.160]  saying well since we're not FDIC we're allowed to keep your money and Walmart
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.680]  does this they take insurance out on those greeters and they have actuaries
[19:17.680 --> 19:22.480]  they know statistically how many are gonna die per year people like oh sweet

[19:26.640 --> 19:31.000]  job greeting people now they got a million dollars or more of insurance on

[20:08.520 --> 20:12.560]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[20:12.560 --> 20:15.960]  true seeds at all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[20:15.960 --> 20:19.920]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science

[21:07.680 --> 21:12.160]  monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority
[21:12.160 --> 21:16.400]  rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[21:16.400 --> 21:20.240]  dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children

[22:24.520 --> 22:29.000]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.160]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the

[24:10.360 --> 24:18.440]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went higher and
[24:18.440 --> 24:25.120]  it burns burns burns the ring of fire by the way Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who
[24:25.120 --> 24:30.640]  sends us his columns to publish it info wars.com two days ago sent us the year
[24:30.640 --> 24:36.040]  America dissolved and Drudge had that as his top length this morning it's now
[24:36.040 --> 24:41.120]  moved down to the right hand column second story down but amazing to have
[24:41.120 --> 24:48.520]  the drudge report leak link to a hard core report you know forecasting the way
[24:48.520 --> 24:53.480]  this country could possibly collapse Mexico has collapsed North Korea has
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.320]  officially collapsed and has a failed state and the bigger the empire and the
[24:57.320 --> 25:02.320]  more overextended it is the worse the collapse will be this is a serious
[25:02.320 --> 25:08.760]  problem and a real possibility and under the story we have two videos posted
[25:08.760 --> 25:13.640]  that I have produced especially on this subject one of them from two weeks ago
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.880]  road warrior level collapse imminent and so it's important to go to the drudge
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.680]  report and get that story and send it out to everyone you know we appreciate
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.760]  the drudge report drudge report.com linking to prisonplanet.com and info
[25:28.760 --> 25:33.560]  wars.com stories well you know I've talked a lot about this in the last
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.040]  decade because I remember reading Pentagon reports and others that we've
[25:37.040 --> 25:43.240]  cited where they said using search engines and using NSA data mining of
[25:43.240 --> 25:49.480]  your cell phone calls where you travel tracking your cell phone by GPS using
[25:49.480 --> 25:55.120]  face scanning cameras license plate reading cameras that they can predict
[25:55.120 --> 26:00.760]  currently with over 93% accuracy where you're going to travel what you're
[26:00.760 --> 26:10.320]  going to do just off of your past movements with your cell phone personal
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.080]  tracker system and that's what the telecommunications act of 96 stated it
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.600]  was for they can also dial in and listen to you without warrants track you in
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.640]  real time the CIA run top secret America fusion centers that are really
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.120]  federalization internationalization centers they a police can dial in in
[26:29.120 --> 26:35.000]  real time and pinpoint exactly where you are this is the control grid but more
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.200]  importantly with RFID and smart dust going into most of the products they
[26:40.200 --> 26:46.600]  admit that it will create a Google-like search ability of not just cyberspace but
[26:46.600 --> 26:53.000]  the real third dimension plane that we live on and with the face scanning a
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.120]  cell phone tracking the transponders with your Google searches with your Yahoo
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.520]  searches and now with the NSA routing all internet traffic through their hubs
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.240]  all internet activity and now most businesses being conducted on the web
[27:08.240 --> 27:13.680]  everything's being integrated through the web it is the worldwide wire tap and
[27:13.680 --> 27:21.640]  they now admit this but here is wired magazine today wired online exclusive
[27:21.640 --> 27:26.840]  it's like saying exclusive the sky is blue but I guess it is exclusive for them
[27:26.840 --> 27:33.760]  they just learned this exclusive Google CIA invest in future of web monitoring
[27:33.760 --> 27:38.800]  and it says the investment arm of the CIA and Google are both backing a company
[27:38.800 --> 27:44.000]  that monitors the web in real time and says it uses the information to predict
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.000]  the future and of course this comes out of MIT Google was founded out of MIT
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.400]  in Kutel is a admitted CIA front so even a front they admit it's a CIA
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.680]  investment arm that's funded much of Google and other major systems giving
[28:01.680 --> 28:08.440]  them government keyword software it's NSA echelon search systems that Yahoo and
[28:08.440 --> 28:12.080]  Google and others are based on and so they give these technologies that
[28:12.080 --> 28:17.000]  taxpayers paid to develop that were supposedly for the Cold War they give
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.920]  these just select insider corporations and then basically they just grow up
[28:20.920 --> 28:25.480]  together and control the infrastructure and architecture of the web they're
[28:25.480 --> 28:31.520]  now phasing us into Internet to a fully controlled censored control grid but I
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.400]  want to throw out the problems with this number one remember what they said two
[28:35.400 --> 28:38.840]  months ago in the Washington Post they finally admitted it in spy talk column
[28:38.840 --> 28:44.960]  the CIA said we fake bin Laden videos and the famous bin Laden video is fake we
[28:44.960 --> 28:50.200]  already knew that but they admitted it see they can plant fake info they can
[28:50.200 --> 28:57.120]  claim that the predictive pre-crime systems they've developed show that
[28:57.120 --> 29:00.800]  you're going to commit a crime and the FBI is now saying they've shifted from
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.560]  responding to crime to fighting crime before it happens or terror before it
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.680]  happens and in this article they go oh this former special forces commander
[29:09.680 --> 29:14.320]  just so happens to run this new company and he's working with the CIA kind of
[29:14.320 --> 29:19.280]  like a former special forces colonel runs the carbon tax initiative here in
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.960]  Austin that was in the statesman oh he was with special ops and the CIA this
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.160]  colonel now is gonna run Austin in all the green jobs that means taking over
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.840]  your property your factory everything this is part of the infrastructure
[29:31.840 --> 29:38.560]  takeover top-secret USA 854,000 private operatives with the highest level
[29:38.560 --> 29:42.320]  security clearance we're gonna talk about how it all integrates together and
[29:42.320 --> 29:46.720]  how this is a giant frame-up system straight ahead it's not really a crystal
[29:46.720 --> 29:55.600]  ball stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:50.720 --> 34:10.120]  Genie show we are back live thank you for joining us so breaking this down in the
[34:10.120 --> 34:16.080]  last 30 years conservatively there's been a covert secret federal program to
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.400]  take over the state houses the county sheriff's departments the police
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.880]  departments the city councils the UN has been involved for at least 40 years
[34:24.880 --> 34:31.360]  with what they call minialization or sister city deals where oh Austin is
[34:31.360 --> 34:40.200]  has a sister city in Japan and Pittsburgh has a sister city with Russian
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.200]  cities and they have these exchange programs and they have these threat
[34:44.200 --> 34:49.520]  fusion centers and then you find that the sheriffs the police chiefs are part
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.320]  of these international think tanks where they get vetted and chosen and in some
[34:54.320 --> 34:59.920]  cases sent for several years to be vetted in DC or at the UN our day
[34:59.920 --> 35:04.880]  surveyed it was in the Dallas Morning News was vetted and recommended by the
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.040]  federal government to be the new police chief of Dallas it's not clear if he's
[35:09.040 --> 35:14.040]  gonna get that but but this is how they control everything this is how they come
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.600]  in and take control of your city your county your state you are supposedly the
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.520]  government you are supposedly the sovereign you are supposedly the people
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.440]  but no they're everywhere and now they admit what we told you years ago and
[35:26.440 --> 35:31.400]  it's a lot more than what the Washington Post says eight hundred and fifty four
[35:31.400 --> 35:38.480]  thousand private spies that's private spies ladies and gentlemen in the private
[35:38.480 --> 35:44.000]  sector but if you look at these people they're all former FBI DEA special forces
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.600]  CIA and other covert federal agencies and then above that if you look at who
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.200]  your city managers are in the big cities they're almost all former Goldman
[35:53.200 --> 35:58.440]  Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo city group those are all private
[35:58.440 --> 36:03.120]  shareholders in the Federal Reserve there's only six and this is your
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.880]  government it's run by banks it's run by insurance companies and then they bring
[36:07.880 --> 36:13.280]  in spies they bring in people with high-level security clearances to sit in
[36:13.280 --> 36:17.680]  those government positions and corporate positions in your towns and cities so
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.800]  they can carry out their robberies and their crimes I go back to this huge 15
[36:22.800 --> 36:30.800]  page report from Bloomberg today fallen soldiers families denied cash as
[36:30.800 --> 36:36.440]  insurers profit and in the article they admit that these insurance companies
[36:36.440 --> 36:40.920]  just keep the insurance policies all of it and the federal regulators say that's
[36:40.920 --> 36:45.360]  okay you're allowed to steal the money I mean this is another example go read it
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.520]  for yourself how hard core criminal these people are but they run almost all
[36:50.520 --> 36:54.200]  your sheriffs and police chiefs and city managers and they run the people for
[36:54.200 --> 36:58.080]  mayor and they run it all and they're gonna keep raising your taxes and they're
[36:58.080 --> 37:01.240]  gonna pass laws to shut down your factories so only their buddies are
[37:01.240 --> 37:07.240]  allowed to have factories this is monopoly crony fascism this is a
[37:07.240 --> 37:14.280]  scientific corporate takeover now going back to Google this is so important
[37:14.280 --> 37:21.480]  here they are admitting that the CIA is funding they already have this this is
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.440]  just the public rollout oh there's a private company Google and the CIA are
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.600]  buying together and it's gonna track what you do on the web in real time and
[37:29.600 --> 37:34.640]  it says predict the future let me show people on the document cam predict the
[37:34.640 --> 37:40.800]  future right there predict the future but here's the issue you then read further
[37:40.800 --> 37:45.760]  into this and they've got a video on there in fact guys grab that for me in
[37:45.760 --> 37:51.400]  this wired article they've got a link to a YouTube put out by the CIA company the
[37:51.400 --> 37:55.840]  CIA front not even a front again they just admit it where they go oh we're
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.080]  tracking al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists on message boards and on the web and
[38:01.080 --> 38:05.400]  their emails and we can predict when they're going to strike there's just
[38:05.400 --> 38:11.960]  one big giant problem with this this is a government and a CIA that admittedly
[38:11.960 --> 38:17.360]  puts out fake bin Laden and Adam Gadan videos admittedly they admit they've
[38:17.360 --> 38:22.080]  done it now they're like oh mr. Jones you're gonna exposes the public are such
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.000]  stupid slaves we're going to admit to them in the Washington Post and Wired
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.520]  magazine a separate article about fake Adam Gadan videos two years ago we're
[38:31.520 --> 38:37.040]  just going to admit we're lying to them and so the whole things a lie it says
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.400]  this software is to stop al Qaeda and Taliban they would never want to stop
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.000]  their Wahhabist terror arm they've used to overthrow country after country
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.800]  whether it's Kosovo or what's happening in Iran right now they run these people
[38:48.800 --> 38:52.920]  they created these people so to say that this system is for them as a lie
[38:52.920 --> 38:58.120]  number one it's pointed at you we've got their internal my act at homeland
[38:58.120 --> 39:04.040]  security reports it's for you you the average person to understand what you're
[39:04.040 --> 39:07.040]  thinking what you're doing and how to counter you so when they see a political
[39:07.040 --> 39:12.420]  trend they can see it from far away with 2020 vision and then start trying to
[39:12.420 --> 39:16.360]  sabotage it they've got admitted cybersecurity disinfo systems where
[39:16.360 --> 39:22.040]  automatic troll computers go out when a story is trending and then they demonize
[39:22.040 --> 39:26.280]  and attack whoever the patriot is that's fighting the establishment or they
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.720]  can automatically generate disinfo this is computerized information warfare
[39:31.720 --> 39:35.840]  against you the American people so a they claim this is for Taliban al Qaeda
[39:35.840 --> 39:41.040]  that's a complete lie b they're constantly putting fake data out they're
[39:41.040 --> 39:44.600]  constantly having the CIA put fake videos out or go put fake statements on
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.760]  message boards that's taken as gospel from bin Laden it's a microcosm of the
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.360]  WikiLeaks which most of the 92,000 documents that have been put out and
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.560]  that the media is run with deals with oh hameed ghoul he's behind the terror
[39:58.560 --> 40:04.640]  attacks oh Pakistan's running al Qaeda and Taliban well Pakistan intelligence
[40:04.640 --> 40:10.000]  was run by the CIA and British intelligence and did create it but they
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.720]  want to go into Pakistan now so they use a leak that I believe they put out to
[40:14.720 --> 40:19.000]  sell all this so they fill the web with disinfo they claim oh look there was this
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.960]  chatter they tell the compartmentalized corporate and government and private
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.880]  sector people the lie that they can predict terror attacks and then the
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.600]  police show up at your door saying the intel shows you're planning an attack
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.600]  from your activities which they've been watching in real time not even a
[40:35.600 --> 40:41.840]  pretense of having a fourth amendment just open naked total surveillance in
[40:41.840 --> 40:48.040]  live time it is illegal to have the CIA doing this it is illegal to have the
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.560]  FBI doing this it is illegal to have them involved in your local cities running
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.400]  the threat fusion centers and that's been admitted all over the news oh the CIA
[40:56.400 --> 41:00.080]  is advising the threat fusion centers and has officers in every major city
[41:00.080 --> 41:06.360]  that's illegal they say well we better do this to keep everybody safe you know
[41:06.360 --> 41:14.600]  we've got to do this to keep you safe America America the corporations that
[41:14.600 --> 41:19.200]  have taken over our government for at least 30 years have quietly spent
[41:19.200 --> 41:25.200]  hundreds of billions of your taxpayer money funding their complete and total
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.920]  takeover of every facet and level of society they have been out there
[41:30.920 --> 41:38.200]  recruiting the preachers they have been out there recruiting everyone they have
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.440]  been slowly going and paying your preachers now over 50,000 in the
[41:43.440 --> 41:46.440]  clergy response teams we told you two years three years before it was even
[41:46.440 --> 41:49.560]  mainstream news we got the secret documents from a pastor people couldn't
[41:49.560 --> 41:55.040]  believe it I mean how creepy and evil is that to have the government the
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.960]  government with your tax money secretly paying off 50 plus thousand that's the
[41:59.960 --> 42:04.200]  last time we got Intel three years ago we learned six years ago about this three
[42:04.200 --> 42:06.760]  years ago was the last time the government made any admissions it was
[42:06.760 --> 42:13.720]  over 50,000 preachers and they plan to double it the next year 50,000 preachers
[42:13.720 --> 42:18.760]  with the training manuals go to the FEMA camp turn your guns in take the
[42:18.760 --> 42:23.280]  inoculations when you're told they've been federalizing police brainwashing
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.560]  I'm turning it against us running former federal agents for sheriff having
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.800]  federal funded think tanks that promote and promise taxpayer money to the
[42:32.800 --> 42:37.560]  cities and states and counties if they put certain police chiefs in place most
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.840]  of these police chiefs are intelligence operatives not of the CIA that's only
[42:43.840 --> 42:49.480]  one hat they wear you've seen romancing the stone where the evil guy what's his
[42:49.480 --> 42:54.580]  name zero or something and every time they seem in South America he's wearing
[42:54.580 --> 43:01.800]  a new uniform that's how real tyrannies work their CIA their FBI their
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.000]  infraguard their clergy response their corporate they've got the highest
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.120]  security clearances when they open up their wallet it's just badges falling
[43:11.120 --> 43:17.720]  out of everything they can do all of it illegal all of it criminal in the last
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.160]  three years we've gone from George W. Bush lying and saying we do not spy on
[43:22.160 --> 43:27.200]  any Americans without warrants we only look at foreign intel with the NSA to
[43:27.200 --> 43:31.120]  him being admittedly a liar to Congress saying okay well you can have a limited
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.400]  spying without warrants if it's foreign intel coming in to domestic phone lines
[43:36.400 --> 43:44.360]  again where's my Washington Post article I just had it here in front of me in the
[43:44.360 --> 43:48.800]  stack where they just come right out and says hey the White House proposes
[43:48.800 --> 43:53.800]  everything in real time any computer records we want you've got to turn them
[43:53.800 --> 43:57.520]  over to us you've got to save all your computer records forever indefinitely
[43:57.520 --> 44:01.680]  and anybody's private computer we want into we're going to go into it under
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.960]  Cyber Security Act that's all this is that's all this is all ISPs even down
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.240]  to small ISPs that have a hundred customers and all private computers will
[44:11.240 --> 44:17.680]  have software that tracks everything you do and sensors what you can see this
[44:17.680 --> 44:22.480]  makes the East German Stasi the greatest police state on earth look like
[44:22.480 --> 44:29.000]  choir boys this is child's play what went on in the 60s 70s and 80s in East
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.600]  Germany that horrible fusion of the Nazis and the communist when the Soviets
[44:34.600 --> 44:42.400]  took over in 1945 East Germany White House proposal would ease FBI access to
[44:42.400 --> 44:47.400]  records of internet activity the Obama administration is seeking to make it
[44:47.400 --> 44:52.000]  easier for the FBI to compel companies to turn over records of an individual
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.520]  internet activity without a court order if agents deem the information relevant
[44:57.520 --> 45:03.960]  to a terrorist or intelligence or intelligence investigation what does
[45:03.960 --> 45:09.400]  the violent belligerence act say it says oh we're gonna fight terrorist and for
[45:09.400 --> 45:13.080]  any reason fighting terrorism the Pentagon the Justice Department can
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.400]  secretly arrest citizens and give you enhanced interrogation that's torture
[45:17.400 --> 45:21.560]  and have you disappear forever with no trial and only an act of Congress can
[45:21.560 --> 45:25.800]  even find out where you are and you don't believe me go read the bill I've had
[45:25.800 --> 45:29.720]  Ron Paul on about it and a Poletano they've concurred with my analysis but
[45:29.720 --> 45:34.640]  it says if we think you may be a terrorist or for any intelligence purpose
[45:34.640 --> 45:40.600]  and so whether it's cybersecurity which passed out a committee or whether it's
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.400]  the violent belligerence act it's all the same wording this is all an
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.840]  integrated complete takeover and now they've got paid private mercenaries in
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.920]  plain clothes including shorts and shirts to make it look shocking to
[45:52.920 --> 45:57.880]  people grabbing people and putting them in dark blue and black vans throwing
[45:57.880 --> 46:04.240]  bags over their heads rob do was in a military base an old armory they were
[46:04.240 --> 46:08.760]  using as a prison in Pittsburgh when he got arrested the g20 for filming for
[46:08.760 --> 46:13.680]  filming the arrest is on tape he's on a hillside filming arrest they came up and
[46:13.680 --> 46:17.760]  said come here you're going to jail and when he got there he saw people being
[46:17.760 --> 46:21.900]  taken off trucks with bags on their heads now what did you see at the g20 what
[46:21.900 --> 46:29.080]  did you see the g20 in in in Toronto a month ago you saw people random activists
[46:29.080 --> 46:34.260]  grabbed by men in plain clothes throwing them into vans and bags being put
[46:34.260 --> 46:38.480]  over their head they're just getting you acclimated get right out in front of you
[46:38.480 --> 46:41.800]  to see people being grabbed on the streets with bags being put over their
[46:41.800 --> 46:46.200]  head you're being acclimated that okay the CIA puts out fake videos what's
[46:46.200 --> 46:49.680]  gonna do about it okay the CIA runs your local police department what's gonna do
[46:49.680 --> 46:53.840]  about it and they're training the police officers to lock down cities and do
[46:53.840 --> 46:58.360]  door-to-door gun confiscations that's admitted in Illinois in New York and in
[46:58.360 --> 47:03.400]  Austin Texas and they've got military checkpoints all over the country where
[47:03.400 --> 47:06.960]  they tell the locals oh it's a drunk driving checkpoint the Marines are
[47:06.960 --> 47:12.640]  helping or there was a shooting our Marines are on the streets this is a
[47:12.640 --> 47:16.920]  complete long-term strategic corporate takeover while the banks took over the
[47:16.920 --> 47:20.640]  states the cities while they got the cities to invest in derivatives while
[47:20.640 --> 47:24.280]  they paid everybody off while they got their own police chiefs and sheriffs in
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.640]  position they've got their people in position the populations waking up and
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.240]  getting upset we're trying to get good sheriff selected we're supposed to run
[47:32.240 --> 47:35.080]  the country where the people we're supposed to vote we're trying to get
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.480]  good mayors in we're trying to get good governors in good legislators in and the
[47:39.480 --> 47:42.120]  feds are saying if you're for states rights you're a violent terrorist that
[47:42.120 --> 47:49.400]  wants to kill cops see we recognize the covert long-term strategic takeover now
[47:49.400 --> 47:52.720]  they're bankrupting us we always said the full takeover would happen when they
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.680]  instituted the depression we're now going into the depression they're now
[47:56.680 --> 48:02.360]  rolling all this out publicly that they quietly built over 30 plus years I have
[48:02.360 --> 48:07.520]  tracked this back and told you exactly what was going on for 15 years on air
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.000]  not because I'm smart but because I researched the information and I studied
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.480]  history and let me tell you what I saw the Soviets do in history and the Nazis
[48:16.480 --> 48:22.120]  and the chai comms and pole pot is exactly what's going on but literally a
[48:22.120 --> 48:26.960]  hundred times more sophisticated and more patient these globalists when they
[48:26.960 --> 48:31.760]  bring America down full fully they want to make sure they win because if they
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.880]  don't win they are gonna go down they're all in they're committed and none of you
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.800]  are safe unless you fight back if you cower and think we'll all sit on the
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.600]  sidelines and play it safe if you take the middle road if you sit on the fence
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.360]  if you're a spectator that's what they're counting on they are going to win but
[48:50.360 --> 48:54.520]  if you become a leader and start speaking out at city council calling in to
[48:54.520 --> 48:59.600]  talk radio exposing your local police chief as a government spook if you start
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.680]  exposing the real paradigm and if other officers start speaking out and if
[49:03.680 --> 49:07.160]  people who understand what's happened start speaking on that starting to
[49:07.160 --> 49:12.560]  happen I mean just Ron Paul what four months ago in a big speech said the CIA
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.080]  had a coup in 63 they shipped the drugs in and we're completely run by the CIA
[49:18.080 --> 49:22.840]  just like a third-world country being overthrown we've been overthrown you know
[49:22.840 --> 49:27.840]  what a Chuck Baldwin say here two days ago exactly what I just said what is what
[49:27.840 --> 49:31.640]  are all the real minds out there saying they're finally concurring with my
[49:31.640 --> 49:36.800]  analysis because it's out in the open and I don't blame some people for thinking
[49:36.800 --> 49:40.800]  I was a cook 15 years ago most people haven't read over a hundred books about
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.520]  World War two most people haven't read declassified 300 page long secret
[49:46.520 --> 49:50.440]  dossiers on Adolf Hitler most people haven't read secret dossiers that have
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.240]  been declassified on Joe Stalin most people haven't read secret Pentagon
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.240]  dossiers on the Masonic movement in Germany and how powerful that was and
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.760]  how they were using it for Intel most people didn't happen to pick up a
[50:03.760 --> 50:08.160]  history book when they were 12 and go man this is entertaining but it was only
[50:08.160 --> 50:12.320]  entertaining till I was about 17 and then I started recognizing everything I'd
[50:12.320 --> 50:17.320]  read in history happening now I recognize this from a hundred miles away
[50:17.320 --> 50:22.000]  this isn't a hundred miles away this is in your face this is shoving you right
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.120]  now shoving you down in your seat saying yeah it's a tyranny you better not
[50:26.120 --> 50:29.320]  talk about America better not talk about the Bill of Rights better not talk
[50:29.320 --> 50:33.200]  about the founders better not talk about states rights better not talk about not
[50:33.200 --> 50:36.000]  wanting government health care better not talk about not liking the fellow

[56:40.440 --> 56:44.600]  many crimes but you're just there to raise money and be tax collectors and

[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.720]  view on these big leaks that she said would shake the world a few weeks ago

[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.000]  and then we've got reama govern joining us former top-level CIA analyst to
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.520]  break down the situation when I ran the war drums intensifying the storm clouds
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:02.960]  gathering the dogs of war cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war as Shakespeare

[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:27.960]  latest big developments on that front but some of the other news I want to get
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.600]  into deals with the government just announcing oh yes we're gonna take any
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.040]  stuff off your computer or from your ISP without warrants now does Congress say
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.920]  they're gonna pass a law no Obama says that he's just going to do it on his
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.960]  own he now operates outside of the law kind of like Dick Cheney said he did
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.600]  that he wasn't part of the executive or the legislative or the judicial he just
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.560]  was his own person he could order torture and then when people got in
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.040]  trouble for it they go to prison and he'd brag about how he ordered the
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.360]  torture and he wouldn't get in trouble than a month and a half ago George Bush
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.200]  came out and said he'd order torture again on all these people that followed
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.640]  orders and carried out the torture rot in prison and I'm not saying they
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.000]  shouldn't be rotting in prison but who really deserves to be rotting in
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.040]  prison is the question well those that created the policies John you Alberto

[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.920]  some great victories I really admire her leadership she's also in the film that

[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.040]  Julian Assange on the broadcast he's emailed us back and forth and I think
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.600]  he's done great work releasing the gun pod footage from the Apaches from a
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.480]  few years ago with the slaughter of the Reuters reporters and shooting the kids
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.880]  up and the pilots laughing about it they released what a year and a half ago a
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.720]  secret army manual for black ops captains and above how to stage false
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:02.880]  flag but a lot of people I respect like Tarpley Webster Tarpley and Wayne
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.400]  Madsen others they have concerns and but you know they might be wrong and so
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.560]  that's why I want to have a discussion here but the can maybe it's how the
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.080]  media spun the 92,000 documents because Ray McGovern who's coming later he
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.280]  thinks this is really important and I respect him as well I know he's for real
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.600]  you know he's exposed the Gulf of Tonkin event they tried to stage a year
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.360]  before they did it under chaining right before they left office trying to start
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:32.000]  a war with Iran but Hamid Ghul told us a year and a half ago when he contacted me
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.760]  to come on the show the former head of Pakistani intelligence I was shocked by
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.960]  it he says now is not the time to come back on and email exchanges for some
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.880]  reason but we're working on that he did tell the major papers that this was a
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.360]  staged release that they put out battlefield documents that a lot of
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.360]  times are filled with propaganda fake body count numbers things like that to
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.320]  say that Hamid Ghul is running the Taliban he says yeah I did run it with
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.080]  the US when you know we were fighting the Russians but that's in the Washington
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.760]  Post document leak part of US plots as Pakistani ex-general what ties to
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.320]  Taliban and I also am concerned that it says that the New York Times went to
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.200]  Obama weeks before when Assange had given him this info and got his
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:18.600]  permission and so maybe that's the issue that Wikileaks didn't release this
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.360]  first of the public they went to the Guardian, Der Spiegel and the New York
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.280]  Times and so maybe that's the issue is how the mainstream media spun it but
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.120]  Birgitta has when he was in hiding a few months ago was his spokesman for a
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.480]  time she knows him one time she was on with us and he was in the background
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.920]  there via video Skype so joining us from Reykjavik is Birgitta Jones daughter
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:44.280]  here Birgitta what do you think of what I've just said well it's you said a lot
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:51.480]  of things and I understand the worries that some people have about this
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:59.200]  release however I can assure you that Julian Assange did not contact the Obama
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.640]  administration weeks before this leak what happened was that a journalist
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:10.840]  approached him from the Guardian about having an embargo and to work with
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:17.280]  Wikileaks on just going through this incredible amount of documents and
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.600]  however I have had confirmation about that the New York Times actually went to
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:30.480]  the Obama administration two days prior to the actual leak well let me just
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.080]  interrupt then I'll shut up for a moment I want to be clear I don't know what I
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.640]  said but if I misspoke I meant to say the New York Times went to Obama not
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.000]  not not Julian Assange well I think that is quite important because he can't
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.880]  possibly go to United States as things are however I think if we just look at
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.360]  it a little bit differently or at least how I've been looking at it because we
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:12:00.560]  did do an experiment here in Iceland when the Iraqi video was released by
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:07.240]  working with a journalist and giving them an opportunity to work with the
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:16.600]  background material while we were working on making the video as accessible
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.280]  as possible for the general public and that was actually quite successful in
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.760]  the sense that we managed to get all the necessary background information such
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:31.240]  as tracking down witnesses and finding the children and just to make sure that
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.240]  this was not a falsified video and I do think that is very important that
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:41.120]  Wikileaks does everything in their power to ensure that that you think the
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.680]  criticism could just be paranoia or maybe some people are a little bit
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:53.520]  jealous probably a mix of both I think I think it is very important that they
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.480]  actually did go through all the files with experts in investigative journalism
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:05.440]  also to make sure that as little information would be there that would
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:12.640]  put the lives at risk and I've actually heard reports today that they did not
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.480]  manage to get out all the necessary information and if that is true that is
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.400]  of course very regrettable I just also want to stress that I am not a spokesperson
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.680]  for Wikileaks currently I'm just speaking on behalf of myself here no but
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.320]  I mean I mean am I correct in saying while he was in hiding what a month or
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.600]  two ago that you were for a period is what I'm saying yes absolutely I did
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.960]  decide to stick my neck out because somebody needed to be accessible if
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.800]  media or others needed to get some information well Brigitte we salute you
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.040]  on that front but but you know I think the concerns do have some validity only
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.440]  in that we know the media is spinning this towards an escalation of forces
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.920]  that they now admit the thing is you can't hold Wikileaks responsible for
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.640]  how the media chooses to spend it is now it is our the citizens and the people
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.000]  that are working like you and others with more of a social media it is our
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.040]  responsibility to make sure that we spin it in the correct on the correct
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.880]  path and to base it on the information that is found in these documents and you
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.200]  know one of the things that I find to be very important and many people I've
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.320]  forgotten the warning that the Russian Russians gave NATO before the native
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.920]  decided to attack in Afghanistan and that is you're never gonna win this war and
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.360]  from these documents you can see that this is an unvinnable war you cannot
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:45.120]  win this war so I think it does raise valid questions as you know Obama
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.320]  promised to pull the troops out I can't see that that is actually happening so
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.560]  they're always didn't you just pass a huge bill with huge amount of money to
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.160]  carry on the war effort effort in Afghanistan while your nation is
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:04.720]  suffering from poverty and starvation it's just should be an encouragement for
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.880]  Mr. Obama to carry on with the plan that he promised this nation your nation
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.520]  before he was elected well Brigitte I agree with you this is earth shaking as
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.480]  you said a month ago that the info coming out would be earth shaking and
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.360]  it's a very complex issue I mean I think bare minimum the media mainstream media
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.520]  is spinning the material towards an attack or an escalation of military
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:33.240]  forces inside Pakistan and and what do you expect them to do I agree the
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.480]  documents that I've looked over of course I haven't had time to read much of it
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.880]  I mean I've read quite a bit but there's 92,000 documents does show a clear
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.280]  picture of an unwinnable war and so I think that you have a lot of courage
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.040]  even you know being affiliated as a spokesman for a while when he was in
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.000]  incominicado and I think mr. Assange has a lot of courage I've praised him in the
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.200]  past I've just been confused by a lot of people that I respect having their
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.240]  concerns well you have like John Young and I am thoroughly shocked by the way
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.160]  he has been using his website just to publish slander from somebody claiming
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.720]  to be a WikiLeaks insider just from the stuff related to things that I've been
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.440]  doing I mean there's a lot of slander about me and my movement in the
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:23.000]  parliament there as well claiming for example that we are funding WikiLeaks
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.240]  which is so ludicrous because we don't have any money well I mean Brigitte I
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.920]  think you're a wonderful person and you've borne great fruit so I was not
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.000]  aware of that but I mean let's talk about from what you know about WikiLeaks
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.720]  what what you take away from this incredible information well from this
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.880]  particular leak or just in general overall I think WikiLeaks is incredibly
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.800]  important in the sense that there is no other place in the world currently that
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.600]  offers such incredible protection for sources and so there is been if you just
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.720]  go through the website and look at some of the documents that are there you
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.240]  realize how incredibly sad it is how the mainstream media has completely ignored
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.040]  some of these important leaks and I think maybe this experiment with the
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:22.640]  other with the mainstream media puts WikiLeaks on the agenda gets it into the
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.320]  mainstream media to get more attention to what is actually being leaked I think
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.800]  that is important I think it is important that the journalists in general
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.840]  start to work together because everywhere you see funds being slashed when it
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.760]  comes to investigative journalism and if if we ever have needed investigation
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.920]  into the big corporations into the military machine into corrupt
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:49.240]  governments we need it now because we are such transformational state as not
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.600]  only as individual countries but as humanity we are running out of planet
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:58.400]  and we need to start to work together and I really encourage I am so concerned
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.680]  about what is currently happening in the Gulf of Mexico and you know I've been
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:07.280]  reading first-hand accounts from people that are there that are trying to do
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.160]  rescue work and their accounts and then what you see in the media is very
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.200]  disturbing well we're going to talk about that after the break then since
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.640]  you bring up the Gulf of Mexico but separately WikiLeaks released key
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.480]  Bilderberg info and the mainstream dominant corporate media ignored that so
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.520]  you know I I mean early on I've been defending WikiLeaks and think this is
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:31.640]  important but then I get criticized so I've been trying to really gauge it and
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.600]  and figure out what's really happening here but I do see the mainstream media
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.120]  putting the focus back on WikiLeaks like they're bad from one perspective and
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.120]  Senator Graham calling for criminal indictments and then I do see some of
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.920]  the alternative media raising questions so that's why we've been trying to flesh
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.480]  it out and have a larger discussion I wish Julian Assange would come on this
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.560]  radio show and you know tell us directly and but I know he's tried to be
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:02.280]  impartial and just release the info without giving his views on it but I
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.360]  think he has given some of his views in you know in fairness you know saying
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.760]  this shows you know that the you know of the carnage that's involved well it
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.160]  just shows the horror of war every day day by day and it doesn't show like one
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.600]  massive huge killing it just shows the everyday killing of citizens and also
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.080]  how the war has been painted in different colors than you can actually read
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.640]  there I think it was important if I if this would have just been done on
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:36.880]  WikiLeaks without any explanation and in that investigation into for example the
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.360]  military language I mean I don't understand most of the language I'm not
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.560]  born and raised in that sort of link link so I think it is important that we
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:51.600]  worry you know that we have an access to some sort of understanding what is all
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.720]  means absolutely let's talk about more of what's in those documents than the
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:01.560]  Gulf of Mexico info and the latest there in Iceland and the film when you hear

[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:12.000]  we are back live and we do need to have the focus on the documents the
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.280]  massacres the killing the fact that the war is a disaster that the troops are in
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.960]  there being forced to grow the opium instead of just obsessing over Wiki
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.200]  leaks need to look at those documents themselves and the controlled media has
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.800]  been pretty successful at spinning it away from that Brigitte Jones dot year
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.200]  looking over these documents I mean how long ago did you know about the
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.240]  documents before they released them just a little while before I there is
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.640]  actually so much occurring in Iceland that I've had to put my focus on there
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:52.920]  in the last month or so but what I've seen and just also just from reading I
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.000]  was in particularly impressed with the Guardian I wish I could read the speaker
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  which is a very reputable German weekly magazine I was disappointed with the
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.440]  take of a New York Times on it it was way too soft somehow and just didn't
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:17.000]  really get into the griftiness of it what it shows us is that the war is
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.800]  actually not going as well as the mainstream media and the Obama
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:28.760]  administration has been depicting for the world and I do feel you know this is
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.640]  a NATO operation I stand this for example member of NATO and we have sent
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.560]  people there even though we don't have a military they now changed it into peace
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.320]  corps but I have been told by somebody that served there that this is just
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:48.560]  military training so I think every NATO country for example needs to I do think
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:55.200]  I am a part of I I go to the NATO parliamentary meetings and ironically I'm
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:59.880]  a part of that I believe we need also people that work for peace and
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.080]  pacifist being a member of the Icelandic Parliament and being able to go to
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.440]  these NATO meetings what is the sense of Europe I mean I've read in the polls at
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.560]  the people do not want to be an Afghanistan yes and you know for example
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.960]  I really don't think that anybody has a comprehensive understanding of the
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.600]  purpose of this war I mean first many people felt it was like a revenge
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:31.760]  against the 9-11 attack in the US then they wanted to liberate the Afghanis
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:37.200]  from themselves or the Taliban or the opium lords and now we get news about
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.160]  and have been known it's been known for years that the opium trade is so strong
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.240]  in Afghanistan how is that possible we heard also I remember that there was a
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.760]  very much propaganda around that they a NATO wanted to help Afghanistan to build
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:59.160]  schools and liberate women and so forth is that really happening is you know the
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:05.120]  infrastructure of Afghanistan stronger I don't think so so what is the purpose of
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.800]  this war let's talk about that what is the purpose of war in Afghanistan from
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:17.120]  your research what is the purpose well it's about natural resources what else
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.040]  yeah it's not opium it's about lithium it's about oil and gas pipeline routes
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.440]  it's also about being a strategic base to menace Russia Pakistan and China I
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:35.040]  mean NATO means the North Atlantic military alliance or whatever and it's
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.680]  very far from the North Atlantic what is NATO doing and NATO has announced the
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.680]  last five years they want to be a global force now really yeah exactly well I
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:52.240]  think that that is not for example division of those almost very many
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.960]  people in Iceland are not happy with us and being part of NATO because we want
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:01.160]  to be a pacifist nation for Gita do you think that this is going to have the
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.440]  same effect that the Pentagon Papers did with finally starting the end of the
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.200]  Vietnam War do you think I mean because this is earth shaking if we're able to
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.240]  actually get the information out of the people well Daniel Ellersberg says that
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.880]  he compares this to the Pentagon Papers and he is of course the person
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:22.640]  responsible for that leak so you know he is a person that are greatly respect
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.480]  and I encourage people to listen to what he's been saying about this leak and
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:33.400]  WikiLeaks as well I hope that this will be the end of this war but I really do
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.480]  also hope that the material that has been leaked on WikiLeaks and elsewhere
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:44.200]  about the reality of war modern warfare and the motivations behind these wars
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.520]  will give people enough power to actually stop the next war looming we all
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.160]  know that they are trying to start a war against Iran they want to have much
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.640]  more stronghold in this region so this should be an empowerment for those
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.280]  that are sick of all the spending on military while people are you know
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.080]  starving in our world
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.520]  well I just I just hope that people realize that we're not in Afghanistan
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:17.480]  for the reasons the different reasons we've been given in the past how was the
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:22.600]  Icelandic media covering WikiLeaks
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:30.280]  they're quite positive about it except of course the predictable media it's
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.600]  always the same it's left and right gameplay

[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:07.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:11.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:23.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:27.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.720]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.920]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.920]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:12.960]  defending the Republic from enemies born in domestic it's Alex Jones we got
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.080]  Ray McGovern he thinks the WikiLeaks situation is huge news very important
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.920]  he's had a chance to analyze some of the 92,000 documents he'll be joining us
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.640]  30 minutes to the next hour and then the father of the birther movement a lot of
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.680]  key intel he's developed turning Phil Burgs joining us in the last half of
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.240]  the next hour going back to Brigitte Jones daughter you're I've asked her a
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:41.080]  lot of questions I appreciate her joining us how I want you to get into the
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:45.040]  banking fight and then the intel you wanted to get into you know the the
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.240]  info you're getting that we're not getting in the mainstream media about
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:53.360]  the oil spill now the new CEO BP US says yeah it may still be leaking as we're
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.720]  seeing a lot of deception there but before we do that how do folks support
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:06.560]  Iceland and your movement to beat the banking takeover well I guess the best
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:14.280]  way of supporting us is just to support any attempts in your own countries to
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:21.240]  change the way we handle the monetary system we we need to rethink the way we
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:27.160]  do banking the way I see reserve banking it is criminal act and we are
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.760]  hoping it looks actually quite positive that the best bank will be established
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.560]  in the city of Reykjavik it is being looked into now by the Reykjavik City
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:44.520]  Council and there is sort of a growing understanding among people and I'm
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.920]  actually attending tonight a meeting about the monetary system in Iceland
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.640]  a grassroot group that is also been bringing forward this idea about the
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.680]  best bank which is based on the model of North Dakota you already have so many
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:04.320]  fantastic things in place in your country that would be fantastic to see if you
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.320]  would do this in each and every state for example to have like the Bank of North
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.920]  Dakota it is such an incredibly fantastic model to base you know and to
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:21.160]  to have business with so you know I guess the best support we could have
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:27.720]  right now is like I have asked before is if you have any information you know a
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:33.360]  deep information about how the IMF functions any recent good documentaries
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.800]  about the IMF how they roll over nations and destroy them that would be very
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.640]  useful we're trying to form a group and we're going to have a big rally next
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.240]  month to raise awareness about who is really in charge in Iceland and there
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:53.200]  has been actually regular protests outside their offices my biggest concern
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:36:00.240]  right now is the IMF and their influence on our energy sector and their
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.200]  desire and or actually their demand that we will prioritize our energy sector
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.920]  which has always been publicly owned and should still be publicly owned we are
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.520]  just I think the biggest support is actually just growing awareness about
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.200]  you know just keep your eyes on Iceland and support the IME initiative and but
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:28.200]  you know I like to see it as a I like to see people in general just wake up and
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:33.080]  realize that they they are the chains even though this is an Obama slogan I
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.400]  think it's a good slogan I think each and every one of us have to remember that
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.840]  we as individuals can change the world and I was really in time for that in
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:49.680]  relation to the BP I don't have a lot of insiders information I have just want to
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.800]  encourage people if they do have information that they feel that the
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:00.920]  general public should have access to to just leak it it's simple everybody
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:07.320]  needs to be aware of what is really going on there the storm season is about
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:14.040]  to break on isn't it in August but there are the hurricanes and so forth I think
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:21.040]  also it is important to encourage journalists and activists to work very
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:25.080]  thoroughly together in investigating also the history of BP because I've heard
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:30.040]  that they have there have been similar accidents like the one in the Gulf of
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.600]  Mexico and South America that got very little report about well you're right
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:40.280]  BP has the worst safety record in the United States alone they have had more
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.920]  violations and more disasters according to the Associated Press than all the
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:51.760]  other oil companies in the Houston area combined and and now that their last
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.240]  CEO has gone to Russia and the guy they had running Russia BP operations he's
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:04.840]  become the new head here so it's just amazing yes and I think if we can begin
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:11.200]  our information about them and get it into the mainstream media I mean I saw a
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:16.280]  video clip from CNN saying that the First Amendment was being broken on them
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.720]  and you know because they couldn't report about for example the people that
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.200]  are getting sick that are working in the cleaning effort about all the animals
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.440]  small and lards that are dying and just the fact that they used the this
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:36.160]  experimental chemicals so that the oil spill is you know 90% underwater so you
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.720]  can't see it and then you know it's a blackout media blackout so you the media
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:46.480]  is completely controlled just like the war in you know the first Iraqi war and
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:54.880]  you know I just encourage everybody to both pull together the information and
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:00.320]  harass your local representatives so that you can actually get an
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:08.400]  understanding what is really going on and I think that in general if we allow
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.760]  the big corporations to do you know their criminal activities with unpunished
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.480]  and just to turn away when people aren't distressed like you know is in that
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:24.760]  entire region then we haven't learned anything then they're winning well you're
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.720]  right I mean then it allows them to set the precedent to get away with anything
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:32.080]  they want Birgitta Jones daughter you're a member of the Icelandic
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.800]  Parliament really leading the opposition against the banking takeover and
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.600]  having a lot of success we salute your great work and God bless you and if more
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.440]  people have the same spirit of liberty that you have we wouldn't be in such bad
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:48.920]  shape so I hope that your spirit of of freedom it does infect others and of
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.440]  course much of what she's talking about is in the film the secret of Oz I would
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.560]  add it's available at info wars.com Birgitta thank you for joining us on
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.960]  short notice what's the best website for people to visit to find out more about
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:09.880]  your work it's probably just best to get on to Facebook I have a fan page there
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:15.760]  where I'm actually quite active there to both put in the newest links and films
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.880]  and so forth and I really strongly want to urge people to see a very very
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.280]  important film called flow for the love of water you can see that for free on

[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:34.160]  urge everybody to see that particular film and I urge people to be in touch

[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.280]  the way the maker of this film director Bill still who made the money masters
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:05.640]  went to Iceland that's in his film it's got a Ellen Brown Byron Dale Joseph
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:10.240]  Farrah professor Michael Hudson James Robertson Peter ship professor Quentin
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:15.360]  Taylor and many others it is available at info wars.com discounted it
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:22.640]  exposes the banking cartel and solutions of how to stop these people now I want to
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:29.360]  shift gears I talked in the first hour a lot about Google and a report out of
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:36.920]  Wired magazine today their online version exclusive Google CIA invest in
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:43.720]  future of web monitoring and it says an investment arm of the CIA and Google are
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.080]  both backing a company that monitors the web in real time and says it uses the
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:54.880]  information to predict the future predict the future you heard me right
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.720]  tracking everything you do in real time your cell phones your smart meters
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.320]  watching what you're doing in your house they're coming out with new
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:08.120]  appliances that control and track what's in your refrigerator just total
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.880]  surveillance the nanny state the company's called recorded future and it
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.840]  scores scours tens of thousands of websites blogs and Twitter accounts to
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:21.240]  find the relationship between people organizations actions and incidents
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:27.120]  both present present and still to come so it's pre-crime in a white paper the
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.080]  company says it's temporal analysis engine goes beyond search by looking at
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:37.400]  the invisible links between documents that talk about the same or related
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.040]  issues so its relationships entities and events and it goes into how it's being
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.880]  funded by Google and the CIA and is run by a former Swedish Army Ranger with a
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:52.080]  PhD in computer science and it goes into the 16 person Cambridge Massachusetts
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:43:00.280]  firm attractive to Google ventures and in cutel a branch of the CIA now I made
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:05.840]  the point that there this doesn't point out that the government admits they post
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.800]  fake al-Qaeda blogs everywhere to scare the public even the CIA admitted in the
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.920]  Washington Post two months ago they've created fake al-Qaeda videos with bin
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.760]  Laden and others this is admitted and so they're tracking all this fake info
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:23.000]  that private corporations and intelligence agencies and government and
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.840]  outside of government are posting to create the this fake illusion of men
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.360]  with turbines hiding underneath your table trying to suck the blood out of
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:37.640]  your feet or hiding in your closet or under your bed and the fact that they do
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:42.640]  put out fake info constantly and that they can also then come to you with
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.600]  pre-crime and say that they've got evidence you've committed a crime and
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.800]  they talk about that in here we already proved a lot of techers were used to put
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.680]  hundreds of thousands of innocent people in prison the government's have been
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:56.720]  caught all over the place planting fake DNA evidence on people they can fake
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:02.200]  fingerprints I mean all of this is admitted and so you can't trust the
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.600]  big corrupt system to be doing this but now they admit that all of this
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:11.240]  surveillance is really going on and happening this is so important now I
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:16.120]  just wanted to recap that because it dovetails with this this is the
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.400]  Washington Post today White House proposal would ease FBI access to
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.200]  records of internet activity but you read the full proposal it's also them
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:29.440]  getting into your computer with remote access basically expanding the sneak and
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.520]  peak provision with no warrants the Obama administration seeking to make it
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:37.040]  easier for the FBI to compel companies to turn over records of an individual's
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.400]  internet activity without a court order it's without a warrant if agents deem the
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:48.040]  information is relevant to terrorism or an intelligence investigation what is the
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:52.160]  enemy combatant act say what is the violent belligerent act say what is the
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.240]  Patriot Act says for any misdemeanor crime it says they could secretly arrest
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:02.000]  you for any intelligence purposes all of this so this is pointed at you we know
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.120]  almost 100% of the Homeland Security apparatus with 854,000 private spies
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:13.080]  secretly federalizing police chiefs all of this is now coming out we know it's
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.200]  pointed at gun owners conservatives landowners businesses that aren't part
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:22.800]  of the New World Order so global businesses can consolidate control and
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.880]  have espionage private intel on you I read Bloomberg with their big report
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:35.360]  fallen soldiers families denied cash as insurers profit and it admits public
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.960]  health that the reports here say that every major insurance company is
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:46.160]  involved in this and it goes on to say this is bad faith this is criminal it's
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.400]  institutionalized bad faith in my view this is a scheme to defraud by inducing
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.120]  the policyholders beneficiary to let the live insurance company retain assets
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.480]  they're not entitled to it's turning death claims into a profit center and they
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:03.080]  just mail you something saying here's your checkbook to draw your dead husband
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:09.440]  or dead son's insurance money and when you sign it then they take and 400,000
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:15.360]  500,000 a million dollars from you and give you 1% interest a year on it but
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.520]  never give you the full money and it goes on the article talk about how it's
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.680]  criminal but they got the feds to change the regulation so they could do this and
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:27.160]  it goes further than that big corporations you know higher greeters at
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.120]  their front doors and then they've been caught taking insurance out of them and
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.840]  never even telling the family and keeping it and they've done actuaries
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:37.600]  knowing a certain amount are gonna die they're gonna get that money this is
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.920]  just an example of how criminal these systems are now I want to shift gears
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.120]  and dovetail again all of this information that we're gonna be
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:58.480]  covering here this caller today called in to the Todd and Don show that's on
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.080]  news radio 590 KLBJ in the morning and I was driving into work and heard this and
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:08.480]  I've heard similar things over and over and over again and it mirrors what the
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:11.600]  woman said in Terror Storm in London where she said I want to give up my
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.600]  liberty for freedom and they say well if you don't have anything to hide let the
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:22.080]  government spy on you well why do we have without warrants why do we even have
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:27.520]  a Magna Carta a bill of rights a Constitution why do we even have due
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:30.560]  process why do we even have property rights why do we have a fourth amendment
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.760]  why do we have any of this is to protect us from a criminal government the
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.640]  government now wants to be able to secretly arrest you for no reason and
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:42.520]  have the military literally take you to a FEMA camp that's in the violent
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:46.480]  belligerence act but it says not for violence for any reason they deem and it's
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:51.680]  secret the great danger is Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin George
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.640]  Washington Thomas Paine explained to us was corrupt government so here's this
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.680]  woman Connie calling in saying I believe the FBI should be able to just do
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:07.200]  whatever they want not have warrants the Constitution's bad we need to get rid of
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.080]  it to keep us safe she doesn't understand our government's now run by a
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.440]  bunch of crooks and that's why the founders put the Bell of Rights there if
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:19.720]  she doesn't like that she should leave America because it's America that was so
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.560]  special we were just more real estate more dirt but we had a freer system that
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.440]  empowered the individual that empowered liberty so let's go ahead and start this
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.480]  clip here it is you don't want the FBI to search your computer no I really don't
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.480]  okay I really don't Connie you're on KLBJ good morning especially since I
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:44.200]  remembered a couple things yeah good morning yes I just was making a comment
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:48.640]  on the FBI being able to come and get your computer and go through it if they
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:53.600]  think you you know there's something wrong if you have nothing to hide you
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:58.360]  should be glad they're doing that because they're trying to protect you and I I
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:04.760]  think we use the Constitution and whatever just to help the terrorists and
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:10.280]  that's stupid we should be helping America and let let them come in and let
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.760]  them do what they need to do to catch these terrorists so sacrifice your
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:17.240]  freedom all right we're gonna come back from break and play the whole clip on
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:22.520]  edited but I just want to point out again this is America we have a Bill of
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.840]  Rights and Constitution we elect judges we elect sheriffs we elect city
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.360]  councils and county commissars and state house legislators and congressmen and
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.040]  women senators that's why the police can't become their own power that's
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.280]  what's happened every third world country and Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.360]  they do become their own power and then they rob and loot and take over the
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.920]  society for the special interest they serve you've got to go to a judge under
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:55.440]  those rules and show your evidence or your probable cause that there's
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.000]  something going on meanwhile the entire Bill of Rights is being removed for the
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.920]  American people and then something that is constitutional the Arizona law after

[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:43.720]  and I I think we use the Constitution and whatever just to help the terrorists
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:49.440]  and that's stupid we should be helping America and let let them come in and let
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.960]  them do what they need to do to catch these terrorists so sacrifice your
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:59.400]  freedoms it's not a it's a freedom would you rather be killed by the terrorists

[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:26.560]  a few soldiers look I think that the soldiers are fighting at a deficit in
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.640]  other words we have all these little laws that are helping the terrorists and
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:37.520]  we need to make it so that they're safer and let the government go and check all
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:43.640]  these bad people good grief you know it's people that are so naive about life

[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.120]  have anything to hide what do you care thank you Connie appreciate it I agree
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.240]  with Connie in many instances anytime I say I don't I don't agree with her at
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:03.920]  all I mean how could you agree with her I mean I guess the founding fathers are
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.600]  idiots and Connie who can barely talk she's an expert but she represents that
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.280]  30% or so in the polls who like the naked body scanners who and the government
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.040]  lies and says we're not recording it we can't see your genitals and now they
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:21.800]  admit they are recording it they are seeing your genitals it is a body scan
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:25.800]  for passive cameras to be used on the streets to look through your clothes and
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:31.800]  know your identity I mean you know just let them secretly arrest us let them
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.480]  round up and put a bag over the head of whoever they want and she thinks the
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.440]  terrorists are these men in caves but if you read all the government documents
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:49.160]  Connie the terrorists are listed as the American people the terrorist are us the
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:56.920]  terrorist this entire system is designed to oppress the American people you say
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:02.320]  protect America Connie have you noticed who's looting the country have you
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:05.480]  noticed who's taking all of our liberties and freedoms Connie have you
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:10.520]  noticed who's looting trillions of dollars have you noticed all the
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:13.920]  oppression that's happening and all the new taxes and how taxes go up but
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:19.040]  government services go down I mean Connie they told us NAFTA and GATT was
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:22.720]  going to be great but their plan was to deindustrialize us a post-industrial
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.200]  society that stated hey Connie do you really believe they want to save you by
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.040]  taxing carbon dioxide that you exhale or do you think the big banks want to rape
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.880]  you financially I mean what does it take Connie for you to stop being such a
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.960]  sheeple for you to stop being somebody who is so incredibly trusting of the
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.760]  system what is your problem Connie sometimes it just it just gives me a
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:53.240]  headache and actually gives me a headache to listen to someone like her who
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.840]  just is ready to give up all of the freedoms that our forefathers fought
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.280]  and died for that made this country so special that made this nation so
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:07.840]  wonderful and it's all being dismantled our country is being converted 100% to
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:15.560]  the greatest tyranny ever seen on the globe and there are so many weak-minded
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:22.840]  wanting sheeple like people that really think the nanny states cares lady why

[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.520]  Alex Jones
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:30.320]  we are now into our number three Ray McGovern it was one of the chief morning
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:33.920]  briefers and analyst of course in George Herbert Walker Bush's
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:41.600]  administration also a army veteran is our guest I wanted to get him on to talk
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.800]  about WikiLeaks because I've seen him saying look this is a big deal the media
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:48.800]  spinning it off into you know why do WikiLeaks do this should they get in
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.160]  trouble instead of looking at what's in these documents and how Afghanistan is
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:58.000]  unwinnable at least from the public perspective of what the system claims the
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.280]  war is for and then we're going to get into Iran more and more it looks like
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.960]  they're greenlighting an attack sometime as an October surprise we'll talk to
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:11.200]  Ray McGovern about that as well Ray it's always great to have you thanks for
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:16.880]  coming on you're most welcome WikiLeaks give us your breakdown on it well there
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.360]  are a lot of interesting things about it substantively it shows that the war is
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:28.160]  clearly a misbegotten effort largely because Pakistan their security
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.160]  services the ISI are supporting the Taliban funding them training them
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:41.320]  leading them in battle it's quite remarkable these these army documents
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.400]  you know these are official documents that recognize this authentic by the
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:54.000]  administration now they paint a picture of the inter-service intelligence unit
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.240]  there and in Pakistan taking the billion of dollars that we give them every year
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.840]  and turn it around and making sure that the insurgency
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.480]  prosperous really and so you know this whole business about the you know the
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:14.880]  border areas and we need to get the Pakistanis to realize that they need to
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:20.640]  throw their lot in with us well what really strikes me as bizarre is so you
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:26.280]  get people like our Secretary of State Hillary Clinton goes down to his mama
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:31.560]  bot and says now to the Pakistani leaders she said you really shouldn't be
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:36.240]  afraid of India and I just came from India they're very nice people there
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:42.160]  and they they told me they wish you no harm and so don't beware about India be
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.480]  worried about terrorists beware about Taliban and al-Qaeda that's what you
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.560]  should worry about now Alex anybody who knows anything about the history of the
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:56.480]  subcontinent it knows that you're not going to be able to persuade the
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.160]  Pakistanis to worry about anybody else but India and vice versa and so how does
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.680]  this impact on Afghanistan well the way that the Pakistanis insure or try to
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:13.560]  insure that India no longer has a preeminent influence in Kabul and the
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:17.720]  rest of Afghanistan is to have their own assets and those assets so once that
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.720]  they were created on that behalf many years ago they called it Taliban and
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:26.680]  they're going to play that card forever and it's just a matter of time before
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:32.040]  before the the feckless counterinsurgency tactic to realize that
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:36.440]  there's an external supply of people and weapons and everything else just as
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:41.040]  there was in Vietnam by the way you know when the north kept supplying the
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:45.160]  troops in the south so we were going to intake this interdict the supply right
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:49.880]  and and we couldn't do that then what do we do we bomb the north so what do we
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:55.480]  do in Pakistan we're bombing Pakistan this time with fancy fancy drone stuff
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.240]  where nobody gets shut down it gets killed give me a break it's the most
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.560]  feckless exercise that I've ever seen and these documents prove it beyond
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:11.640]  reasonable belief now beyond beyond reasonable doubt let's say now the the
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:17.520]  White House three days ago dictated to the stenographers they call themselves
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.400]  the White House press corps and they all took the dictation namely nothing new
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:26.120]  here you know I said oh we do all that stuff we took that into account when we
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:29.840]  made our big decisions late last year and all this stuff and so that goes up
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:33.760]  on the headlines in the Washington Post and the other papers it's ridiculous
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:38.360]  they should read the documents but be safe but they're being discouraged to do
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:44.880]  that you know what it reminds me of reminds me of back in 2005 when the

[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:10.160]  the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.640]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:17.680]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.760]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:27.640]  define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:33.240]  you did during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have the Constitution

[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:26.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:33.200]  alright former CIA analyst and Morning Brayford of George Herbert Walker Bush
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:38.200]  and others my guy who's really made a lot of accurate predictions and
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:42.440]  breakdowns here on this show joins us we were talking about WikiLeaks and what
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:48.080]  that means to the Afghan war the last year I've seen all these denials that
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:53.200]  oh there's not advisors there's not army and CIA advisors in Pakistan you know
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:57.680]  that's a lie that there's no black water there now these documents confirm that
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:02.200]  but just in the last week I guess ahead of these they came out and admit it okay
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:07.000]  days before this came out we do have advisors in Pakistan and it does seem
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.320]  the way they spun this is to pointed at Hamid Ghul the former head of Pakistani
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:15.640]  intelligence and say see we kind of need to be there but I don't think that's the
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:19.240]  fault of WikiLeaks so much of the media just just spinning it but I know Ray
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.840]  McGovern can comment on that and are there big connections from Pakistani
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:26.920]  intelligence to the Taliban and why and then I want to get into Iran and the
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.040]  war drums really getting more and more intense on that front but you were you
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.480]  were cut off by the break Ray please continue sure I was just trying to raise
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:42.840]  a comparison here between the WikiLeaks treatment by the fawning corporate
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:48.400]  media and the way the same fawning corporate media treated the revelations
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.560]  in the after-downing street minutes you'll recall that those were minutes
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:10:00.520]  recording the chief British spy telling Tony Blair that George Bush had
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:06.360]  decided to go to war with Iraq for regime change that this war would be quote
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:12.680]  justified in quote by the conjunction of weapons of military of mass destruction
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:18.160]  and terrorism translation from the British will say that he has all kinds
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:22.120]  of mass weapons of mass destruction and that he's going to use them give them to
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:26.400]  terrorists and finally that crowning sentence for us intelligence specialists
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:30.720]  they went this way quote but the intelligence and facts are being fixed
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:36.280]  around the policy period end quote so that was a manifest information
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.280]  documentary information the minutes of the meeting written by a participant the
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.360]  same day and it showed that the intelligence is being fixed and that
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:50.540]  was July the middle of July 2002 some eight or nine months before the war now
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:55.280]  in this case well in that case the New York Times avoided even mentioning it
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:02.360]  until representative Conyers held that hearing at which I testified and two
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:07.960]  mornings before the hearing he and I were both on Amy Goodman and at that
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.320]  very morning the Washington Post that published that editorial saying oh yes
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.680]  and there are these after bounding street minutes they have there are no
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:22.520]  consequence we knew that all the time they had a laugh because my thought was
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.360]  you know if the Washington Post knew the intelligence was being fixed all the
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.040]  time yeah it really I don't know exactly why they didn't tell us can you get it
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:37.480]  can you hazard against that that Alec so so the situation here is the same they
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.560]  don't want anybody to read them they don't want anybody to analyze them and
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.760]  even the New York Times which was forced to to publish this because they know
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:52.080]  that the Guardian in London and the Dash Beagle in Humboldt that they both had
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:55.520]  them and they would be scooped and it would be very embarrassing for people
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:59.280]  to realize that the New York Times had these documents that hadn't published
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:02.680]  them so what did they do they went to the White House and said you know we're
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:08.520]  thin as pine do we don't want to be scooped and is it okay if we can and the
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:13.040]  White House was very understanding so oh shucks I guess this time you can and
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:18.520]  Robert Gibbs the president spokesman later complimented the responsible way
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:22.480]  that the New York Times conducts themselves I tell you I tell you Alex
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:27.120]  if it if the press has to go to the White House to receive permission to
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.000]  publish things and that's the responsible way to act we've come one heck
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:37.640]  of a long way in the free press of this country do you think this is gonna have
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:44.280]  as much as an effect on the Afghan slash Pakistan conflict as the Pentagon papers
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:50.320]  with Daniel Ellsberg and the Rand Corporation did to the Vietnam War Alex
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:55.160]  I've often said that the biggest sea change that I witnessed in this town of
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.680]  Washington in the 47 years I've been here is that there's no longer in any
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:06.240]  real sense of free press there was back in the 70s there was in the 60s we got
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:10.720]  rid of a president because of a free press there is none now and so it all
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:16.920]  depends on whether the defunct fourth estate has been replaced by a vibrant
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:22.520]  fifth estate and that's the good news folks there's a fifth estate out there
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:29.240]  a free media the medium is the ether it's not susceptible of control by
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:34.520]  governments or advertisers or corporations which don't own it and we
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:41.000]  have the WikiLeaks phenomenon and many other phenomena that that feed on on the
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.440]  availability of this this wonderful resource and so even though the fourth
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:51.200]  estate is dead and that we should duly mourn it because it's a travesty to have
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:56.600]  those folks stenography and they're in a way down the fifth estate is vibrant and
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:02.360]  so I think that if people are given enough information you know it's
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:07.640]  impossible for everybody to read all these army documents but if if there's
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:13.840]  a if people know where to look for real information on this and that's the
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:19.320]  missing link in speaking around town here I've been referring often to the
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:25.800]  WikiLeaks exposure of that turkey shoot that God awful turkey shoot that that are
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.560]  soldiers there and that the patchy helicopter gunship the gun barrel
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:35.440]  photography the video on that with sound showing our young people just
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:40.880]  gloating over the turkey shoot of about a dozen Iraqi civilians minding their
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:47.000]  own business severely injuring two children now when I ask people about
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:53.480]  that nobody knows about it maybe out of a very progressive audience of a hundred
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.600]  people five people say oh yeah I read something about that and only two of
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:02.840]  those have taken the trouble to go up to their URL line and put in collateral
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:08.080]  murder that's all you need collateral murder now Ray we're running out of time
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:11.760]  this is key info you've been covering but we've only got this segment what's
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.360]  left and the short segment coming up with you today and I appreciate the time
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.720]  but going back to something you just mentioned briefly now we see cyber
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:26.640]  security we read about top-secret USA 854,000 private individuals with the
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:30.400]  highest security level we know they're training the military for domestic
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:33.760]  operations the White House admits they want to start censoring the internet
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:40.280]  Cass Sunstein does and it looks like the system realizes it's not going to get
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:44.000]  away with all this corruption if they don't start curtail curtailing the web
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.920]  are you concerned about that I am and specifically because the general now
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:56.640]  four-star general Keith Alexander the same folk is the same fellow who lied to
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:01.800]  congressman Rush Halt who's on the House Intelligence Committee and went out
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:10.720]  there to NSA in December of 2007 and asked Alexander you're not eavesdropping
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:15.720]  on American citizens are you they thought oh no that's against the against
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:21.240]  our first commandment and James Ryzen's article came out just a week later so
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:25.480]  Alexander you know in my day we used to think that army officers shouldn't lie
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:30.400]  well well he lied to his congressional overseer that that's a crime okay and
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:36.440]  now he is in charge of all this cyberspace stuff security offensive stuff
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:41.120]  and still ahead of NSA and now the Washington Post says Obama wants to
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:45.480]  search everybody's computers and ISPs without warrants now something they're
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:49.800]  already doing so we've gone from Bush lying three years ago and saying we're
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:53.640]  not spying on you without warrants that's illegal and to this general doing
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:56.480]  it to him now being the head of it and saying yeah we're listening to everything
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:01.080]  you're doing and Google is in wired magazine today saying we're with the CIA
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:05.240]  watching all of you in real time so they've gone from saying oh we would
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:08.800]  never do that too yeah yeah we're watching everything you know with the
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:16.280]  saving graces here Alex the saving grace is that by adding more straw or more hay
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:22.320]  to the haystack it makes it even more difficult to find the needles now maybe
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:27.120]  you and I are getting special treatment but if you deluge if you deluge the
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:31.560]  system with more and more intercepted coverage just think of the billions and
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.920]  billions of things that they collect every day in NSA it's funny in terms of
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:41.200]  them running down in patriots like us it's not so funny when there are real
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:47.320]  terrorists out there and they can't find this natal in the haystack or corporate
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:52.080]  criminals and we've seen that under Bush senior Clinton right through to
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:56.400]  Obama where they've cut almost all of the government corporate fraud
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:01.120]  investigators you know 11 years ago they knew what Madoff was doing but blocked
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.880]  it now the Federal Trade Commission has been given total anonymity and immunity
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:11.600]  for covering up crimes I mean this is this is wild yeah Alex said that those
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:16.400]  folks all look like us though you know if you're a little darker in color and
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.600]  have a beard or wear some we consider funny on the top of your head well
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:25.880]  that's a big big difference but I don't know how you sort out at NSA how you
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:31.240]  sort for funny looking things on top of people's heads you can't and so the state
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:37.040]  of the art as it was two decades ago is that you can collect immense amounts of
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.960]  information from satellites from intercepted whatever okay you can't
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:48.120]  find what you need unless you get really smart programs and really experienced
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.000]  analysts to guide the retrieval unless just like torture doesn't work unless
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.960]  you want fake confessions and to scare people unless they know none of this
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:04.000]  really works they can just claim their intel shows it yeah you know in part it's
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.920]  what I consider to be the the biggest corporate welfare program in our
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:13.080]  country since the strategic defense initiative you know the anti-ballistic
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:20.280]  missile thing Star Wars Star Wars yeah what you got here is that is the two
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:27.720]  and a half times as big a intelligence budget now as was the case before 911

[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:09.640]  like they're lining up an attack on Iran we're seeing all these different
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:12.760]  government leaders say that it's on in the next three months is that saber
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:16.720]  rattling I think it's more than saber rattling let me give you a little
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:25.840]  background Alex Iran's alleged attempts to build a nuclear bomb a red herring
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:32.480]  folks are red herring the CIA and 15 other intelligence agencies decided made
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:37.600]  a judgment at the end of 2007 that Iran had stopped working on a nuclear weapon
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:42.000]  not on the whole nuclear program but on the nuclear weapon and that judgment
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:47.200]  holds okay it holds to today a new estimate is being updating to this updating
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:53.920]  that but so far that judgment holds now number two Iran has agreed to ship half
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:25:00.200]  of its low-enriched uranium out of country half wow you would think that
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:05.000]  the Israelis and the US those who are afraid of a nuclear weapon import in
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.480]  Iran they jump up and down and say wow that lessens the chances of about by
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:15.960]  about 50% instead they go into sanctions they're going to other things that are
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:23.440]  likely a provoke Iran number three a few a recent Pew poll shows that in 16
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:29.040]  advanced countries most people believe that it's necessary to attack Iran
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.000]  because of its alleged nuclear weapon okay what's the most important thing the
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.840]  most important thing is what Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thinks of our
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:46.040]  president the recent encounter that they had in the White House where Obama
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:49.840]  formed all over him didn't mention the settlements didn't mention the American
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:55.760]  citizen that Netanyahu's forces killed just two weeks before Netanyahu has the
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.920]  impression of our president as a wuss I'm from the Bronx that's a combination
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:07.120]  between a wimp and a pussycat and if that's his judgment which I'm convinced
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:13.680]  it is he's about ready to use what he considers to be his ace in the hole the
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:19.920]  Israel lobby in this country and do what he wishes to do with respect to Iran
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:25.520]  how would it work it send his fighter bombers just up to Iraqi airspace which
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:30.160]  we still control for one more month he would say he'd call that there'd be the
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:35.360]  4 a.m. telephone call to Obama Mr. Obama I just want to let you know we
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:40.640]  discovered some some really bad stuff about nuclear weapons in Iran so our
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:45.320]  planes are going through your airspace now make sure you tell Mike Mullen not
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:50.400]  to shoot any of them down now there's in one person in Washington Alex that
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:54.560]  thinks that Obama would have the courage to say no no no you don't we're gonna
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:59.680]  shoot him down we are not gonna shoot any Israeli planes down Netanyahu knows
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:05.160]  that he knows he can attack Iran Iran will retaliate it will be in in the mix
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:10.240]  big time okay the other thing that he looks at Netanyahu does is the election
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.440]  our president has showed himself allergic to do anything that would
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:19.040]  possibly put any Jewish or Israeli knows is that a joint before the election and
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:25.720]  so this is the time I will predict that the chances are better than even that
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:32.760]  Israel will start a war with Iran next month that's August 2010 so it's it's
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.600]  definitely going into the green light phase and what about false flags we saw
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:42.120]  Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times say Obama has to have an Oklahoma City
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:47.040]  or 9-11 to look strong to the public for us to win the elections I mean that was
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:51.920]  an amazing statement yeah I you know it's just a little trifle more cynical
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:57.880]  than I'm willing to go I see Obama as first and foremost 90% of politician not
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.480]  a constitutional lawyer not a guy that cares about our troops and it's on that
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:07.120]  basis that I judge that he considers it just not a politically feasible thing to
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:12.120]  put the reins on Netanyahu given the strength of the Likud lobby in this
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:17.320]  country well what do you at your gut think you say more than 50% I mean I
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.320]  know you're you're hedging there but I mean clearly they're moving towards it
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:24.800]  we've had the former head of the CIA Haydn say it's inexorable it's going to
[02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:28.920]  happen we hear you know all these noises coming out Ahmed Denizide believes
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:32.440]  it's going to happen in the next three months you're saying August well the
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:35.960]  thing the thing is Alex that you can never be real definitive in these
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:41.120]  predictions because it still isn't Obama's power to prevent this and indeed
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:45.840]  we veteran intelligence professionals for sanity are drafting a memorandum to
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:51.120]  the president right now like tonight okay and what we're going to say is you
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:57.160]  better publicly say you better publicly tell Netanyahu don't do it we're not
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:00.680]  going to support you if you do and that's enough to turn it off and that's
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:05.200]  going to be a consortium news.com yes it will be probably about three days
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:09.920]  consortium news.com we need to get this public statement with all of your
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:15.480]  expert analysis and bombard the White House in Congress with this report yeah
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:19.480]  I would suggest that that'd be great and maybe we can turn it off oh we got about
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:23.080]  30 seconds left anything else we can do to try to avert World War three well I
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.720]  think you call your Congress people you call your senators and tell them that
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.480]  you know it is well we're past the point where we're going to be diddled by a
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:36.120]  country that pretends to be our ally and gets us in a whole pack of trouble in
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:40.080]  the Middle East. Alright consortium news.com as we can read all of the great

[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:28.480]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:32.240]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:23.640]  months ago a lot of states moving to pass laws to make him show it coming up in
[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:27.200]  the next election but he's so politically destroyed now even the Democratic

[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:03.960]  Good to have you. Respect you and you have a great audience out there and
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.640]  hello Alex Jones band. Phil Berg here and you gave me a great introduction this
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:14.360]  is now my 29th year being a volunteer fire police and we all have to give back
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:18.400]  to our community and I'm giving back to our country right now this is now my
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.360]  23rd month in pursuing Obama who is in my new name for me today a complete
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:29.560]  imposter he's a phony a fraud but he's an imposter and we have to do something
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:34.400]  about it I'll get into the latest thing is still pending in the court how I got
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:37.400]  involved in this someone called me up and said had you heard the rumor that
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:41.600]  Obama is not natural born I said a little bit and I did some checking and I
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.320]  filed the first lawsuit against Obama August 21st 2008 before the Democratic
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.360]  National Convention at that time I sued Obama in the Democratic National
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:55.040]  Committee and I figured that their Democratic National Committee would
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:58.800]  question Obama and therefore you know either produce documentation that he's
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:04.040]  natural born or not nominate him but there was collusion there between the
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:07.240]  Democratic National Committee because they didn't do anything and they
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:12.120]  actually have joined forces in fighting my lawsuit I ended up by filing three
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:15.440]  lawsuits and about another hundred lawsuits have been filed around the
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.480]  country most of them dismissed on the area of standing the court has said
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:24.120]  that no one has the right to challenge the Constitution unbelievable but that's
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:28.080]  the court system now and if the national media had done what they should have done
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:33.560]  and that is properly a vet Obama he never would have been nominated what the
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:37.800]  national media did to Sarah Palin is what they should have done to Obama and
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:42.440]  he would not be where he is and the national media is shaking a little but
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:46.640]  they're still covering for Obama the the biggest thing is two months before I got
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:51.480]  involved to quell the rumors on the Obama campaign website they put a
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:55.720]  document up there called a cold certification of live birth trying to
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:01.200]  indicate that Obama was born in Hawaii the document by experts have proven we
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:05.840]  have experts had said it's a phony it's been ordered at the very bottom it says
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:10.440]  if there's any alteration of this document that the document is invalid
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:16.080]  and significant a cold is different than a birth certificate a birth certificate
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:21.200]  has on it the weight of the baby the length of the baby the hospital name the
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:24.920]  doctors name the doctor's signature none of which appeared on this phony
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:30.000]  document which they produce which they continue to refer back to as a birth
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.400]  certificate and the feet I mean it normally has the ink stamp feet I mean I
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:38.960]  have a copy of that with myself so it's this receipt and they've act very very
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:42.920]  secretive and will never release it but then you brought out even more important
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:47.920]  intel and that's why I was neutral on this in the last two and a half years but
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:51.960]  leaning towards it being true and I respect you and others but then when we
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:55.320]  learned that he did give up a citizenship that his real name is Barry
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:01.280]  Sitaro that that when you give up your citizenship to that nation you then are
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:06.560]  not eligible to be president any way you slice this he's ineligible and then the
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.560]  cover-up just adds to the fact of where there's smoke there's fire right and
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.320]  you gave a great analysis there and let me just explain that it's hard for Obama
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:19.840]  to get out of it because in the two books that he has had about his life so
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:23.960]  young one of them says he found his birth certificate so he had so he has his
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:28.560]  birth certificate so you know why he hasn't he why hasn't he produced the
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:32.320]  birth certificate at this time and the other thing is he states that his
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:37.680]  parents were divorced and he mentioned that his mother but his mother remarried
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:42.080]  because he mentioned in his book that his stepfather returned to Indonesia
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:47.120]  before his mother and he did and that's significant because in the needed he
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:50.440]  mentioned his stepfather and we have the school record which you are very
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:55.000]  correct Alex his name is Barry Sitaro so if he hasn't legally changed his name
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.200]  since then and there's no evidence he did his name is Barry Sitaro so every
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:02.920]  time he signs his name is brought to St. Obama and each of the 50 states and
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:06.840]  territories when he ran for president was fraud but he was sworn in as fraud
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:12.640]  and everything he signs now is fraud and and he was known in college as Barry
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.000]  Barry right he's even called into radio shows in the last year saying hey this is
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:22.360]  Barry yep I mean the guy is he's such an imposter it's unbelievable what about the
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:26.720]  new videos two of them of his wife saying you know he was born in Kenya and
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.840]  and you know he we went back to Kenya the place of you know the place of his
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:36.080]  birth I mean she's she's just out there like it's a sick joke right and now that
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:40.160]  that has been released lately in the past few months but that's from 2008 I
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.000]  mean the overwhelming evidence and the overwhelming actual evidence the
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.280]  circumstance level is overwhelming that Obama was born in Africa that he is not
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:54.960]  natural born and because of his status over in Indonesia I believe that he
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:59.200]  came back to the United States of Hawaii at age 10 and I believe they came back
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:03.160]  on his Indonesia passport and then believe it or not he didn't go through
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.240]  immigration and therefore he's not only not natural born he's not naturalized
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:12.000]  but he's an illegal alien all right Philburg let's expand on that because the
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.720]  media always says hey why would his family put a birth announcement in the
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:21.800]  newspaper if that isn't true well if you've got a daughter who's overseas
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:25.840]  she's gonna write she's gonna call I mean they're gonna want him to be a
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.000]  citizen they're gonna want to cover their bases and carry out this fraud there
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.080]  they were high-powered foundation people you know tied into intelligence the
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:38.160]  the evidence is clear I mean that that's happened many times where people
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:42.400]  have dummied up that their kid was really born you know in the United States when
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:46.520]  they weren't well it doesn't really even say he was born in the United States he said he was born
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:51.840]  my children live in different states one of my my daughter-in-law is
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:57.120]  expecting as last year when one of my grandchildren was born I put an announcement
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:01.120]  in a paper here locally where I live that doesn't mean they live here because
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:06.880]  they don't live here and then also Hawaii permitted the a coal being given
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:11.200]  for someone up to a year after birth so you know they hang their head on this
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:16.000]  cove and they hang on this two newspaper announcement of a birth on a
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.680]  street address which people checked out and people there said there was never a
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:23.880]  black child living there so that that to me is not evidence or like on our
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:29.320]  website we have the tape of Sarah Obama that's his step-grandmother in Swahili
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:32.960]  and we have the translation stating that she was in the hospital when he was
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:38.720]  born in my boss of Kenya on August 4th 1961 and they act suspicious are
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:46.200]  grabbing and detaining reporters that go over there time and time again so very
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:51.360]  suspicious absolutely then may she rest in peace but his weight grandmother Hawaii
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:55.400]  he never saw the press near her she would have known where he was born she
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:59.360]  would have known facts about but but she's never got to the press and also
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:03.000]  was you know this is the woman that meant so much to him during his lifetime yet
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.800]  when she died he didn't even fly back for her funeral you know he did it like a
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:10.800]  month later but also two weeks before that he said she's definitely ill and
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:15.520]  I'm gonna fly out in a half hour to see her then he changed his mind and flew
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:19.840]  out two days later and if she's such an important person why didn't he take his
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:23.280]  wife with him and maybe the kids but definitely his wife he didn't take his
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:27.040]  way for them I mean the whole thing nothing makes sense with Obama about
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:31.680]  this but but what is that and let me go back on that where I think he's not
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:35.720]  natural born and not naturalized that's one of the cases I have pending now in
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:41.040]  the DC Circuit Court of Appeals at the Washington DC Court of Appeals which
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:45.520]  affirmed recently the decision to not let my case go forward but I've now asked
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:49.520]  for a court in bonka this for the entire court to hear my case there I'm
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:54.080]  alleging that Obama is not natural born not naturalized but he's an illegal
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:57.480]  alien and therefore his term at the United States Center from Illinois was
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:02.640]  fraud therefore the salary and benefits he received he should be returned to the
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:07.240]  US Treasury which is about a million dollars the those type cases are sealed
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:10.680]  that when I had it sealed that people wondered why all those type cases which
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:15.080]  are called false claim factor QTEM cases are sealed they're you
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:19.440]  mainly used in Medicaid and Medicare fraud cases and they're sealed because
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:23.600]  the person you're bringing against is not notified of the case it goes to the
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:27.040]  Justice Department and the Attorney General's office for them to review the
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:31.320]  case in 60 days and make a decision of one are they going to prosecute the case
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.600]  two are going to let the person who bought the case in this case the what's
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:41.360]  called a relator or three dismissed the case very few cases are dismissed they
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:47.040]  decided to dismiss my case against Obama and I raised the issue of conflict of
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:51.080]  interest and Alex if this scenario is not conflict of interest we should take
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:54.680]  those words out of the dictionary and out of legal dictionary the out of
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:58.840]  legal system I mean the fact that the decision is made by the Department
[02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:02.400]  Justice and the Attorney General's office who's the head of that the
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:05.360]  Attorney General of the United States who's the Attorney General of the United
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:10.080]  States Eric Holder well Eric Holder number one was a senior member of Obama's
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:15.680]  campaign staff number two he was one of three individuals selected by Obama to
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.160]  select a vice president who eventually selected by and number three he was
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:23.680]  nominated appointed confirmed as Attorney General the highest law
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:28.080]  enforcement officer in the country who reports to the president so if that
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:32.720]  person is not a conflict of interest I don't know what is so that's where I'm
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:36.480]  at now with the DC Court of Appeals hopefully they'll have a court in
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:41.040]  bond if not we're gonna take that case of the US Supreme Court well let me say
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.240]  this you've definitely won in the court of public opinion a lot of Congress
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:49.360]  people and others will come out and say that they think the birth certificate
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:53.200]  issue is legitimate there's no doubt the Indonesian citizenship we've got a
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:57.880]  president with a fake made-up name that's confirmed I mean that's why the
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.000]  control corporate media keeps getting so mad that we won't shut up about this
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.160]  and that it just keeps gaining ground in national polls because when somebody
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:10.760]  looks at the actual evidence it is overwhelming that there's a massive
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:15.960]  cover-up and he's ineligible just on the Indonesian citizenship and name
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:21.840]  issue and that's why they've got all of his college records so sealed and so his
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.320]  approval ratings gone from 85 percent down to 40 he's at the lowest
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:30.160]  approval rating of any president this far into their you know situation but
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:33.840]  but then there's the issue you raised years ago on this show he's compromised
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:38.440]  the establishment knows he's Indonesian citizen bare minimum almost
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:43.560]  certainly born in Kenya you know Kenyan citizen born they know that so imagine
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:46.400]  how they're able to blackmail him with this information
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:50.320]  oh I definitely think he's blackmailed I think that that's why most of the
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:54.880]  speeches he gives are on teleprompter he's reading them he's great to deliver
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:59.400]  speech off a teleprompter not as good elsewhere but he's told what to say and
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:03.360]  I think our whole country is in jeopardy because of it this health care bill is
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:06.960]  blatantly as far as I'm concerned unconstitutional and many other things
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:11.480]  he's doing but and that's why and through your help we had scheduled if you
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:14.920]  recall March back more that we had a cancel that for certain reason
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:18.960]  oh we haven't rescheduled yet but looks like we're gonna have it in October
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:22.920]  getting near election time because I think people's interest will be up why
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:26.480]  did you have to reschedule well because of more and more several groups want to
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.920]  join in with me we didn't have enough time to plan it right I want to have this
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:33.720]  March since we're working on a date now for October and I wanted to be the
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:38.960]  largest March in Washington DC history because this up front to our US
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:43.400]  Constitution is the biggest hoax against the Constitution against our
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:49.120]  country against our citizens in 324 years I'm sorry 234 years since our
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:53.480]  Constitution came into effect you know that the comparison has to be for people
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:57.640]  out there their question our short snaker people have talked to him for 10
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:02.080]  15 years about running for president and he constantly said amend the
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:06.920]  Constitution I was born in Austria I'm in the Constitution I was born but you
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:10.800]  know he could just change his name though to like Billy Bob and say I am for
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:17.720]  born in California he could run on the Obama theory from now on Obama is
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:22.880]  destroying the Constitution Obama has basically said I don't care about the
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:27.600]  Constitution he's basically walking all over the country it is a conspiracy theory
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:33.720]  that I was born in Austria I was born in California right right happened Obama's
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:37.560]  when he was I think back in the spring of 2008 when everyone else was
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:42.240]  polluting the flag and he was standing there with his arm down the side how
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:46.080]  about when he would never wear a American flag with Pelton you know he's
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:51.040]  changed that but his and then the biggest thing that's why I'm concerned he goes
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.840]  around the world apologizing to the United States then he bows down to the
[02:48:54.840 --> 02:48:59.320]  Saudi King he bows down to the Japanese Emperor he bows down to the and then
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:03.800]  they lie each time and say that he's dropped something I mean he just oh you're
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:09.520]  majesty oh oh oh oh oh you're so great they're like oh he was picking up
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:15.720]  something yeah he was picking up you know but but just what he has done has
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.920]  destroyed the image of the United States around the world your majesty I'm sorry
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:24.760]  go ahead okay no and that's why we're going to get a date here I'm going to be
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:28.120]  back on your show and we're going to ask people to come because this is the
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:32.600]  biggest I don't care what your issue is with Obama if but think about it if your
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:36.400]  issue is taxation if your issue is education if your issue is medical
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:41.200]  whatever your issue is it all falls back and then I'm appealing in a way to all
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:45.440]  the party people you have different issues out there but the main controlling
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:50.120]  issue is the fact he's a usurper he's a phony he's a fraud he's an imposter if I
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:55.320]  am right and I know I am if the courts won't handle this we the American people
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:50:00.240]  getting together can demand and if we can bring in 1 to 2 million people to
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:04.560]  Washington DC and we can have them there bring a copy of your birth certificate
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.120]  and everyone hold over their head their copy the national media will have to
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:13.080]  cover this and I really believe we can force Obama out of office because once
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:17.400]  the American people stand from see I believe that not enough American public
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.560]  knows about this because remember you need a real live birth certificate to
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:26.920]  register your child for a little while I mean I mean listen listen if he had it
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.560]  he would have released it he's been very suspicious about this and but
[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:34.880]  regardless let's say we're wrong and he was born in Hawaii which the evidence
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:41.320]  shows is not the case he's born in Kenya his real name is Barry Sataro he is an
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:44.800]  Indonesian citizen and went to an Islamic school and I'm not saying it's bad
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:50.600]  they went to Islamic school the point is the guy is as phony as a $3 bill who
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:58.080]  he says he is his name is Barry Sataro Barry Sataro we've got a that guy's an

[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:23.240]  Roberts says US Treasury is running on fumes key article grim tidings from the
[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:27.320]  Netherlands Prince Bernhard's grandchildren continue Bilderberg legacy
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:38.360]  key report up there also Google and CIA plow through millions into huge record
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:43.320]  the future monitoring projects Steve Watson's got this article and it's up
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:48.040]  at GCN live.com again here's another one Google and CIA fund political pre-crime
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:52.120]  technology Kurt Nemo also at GCN live.com and all this is also an info
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:57.920]  wars.com and another big report that Rob Dew wrote world net daily writer says
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:01.200]  fluoride is good for you an open letter to the writer it's a very well
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:06.240]  documented if you want a lot of key fluoride facts that's all at GCN live.com
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:11.280]  going back to attorney Phil Berg also former Deputy Attorney General in
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:15.160]  Pennsylvania that really the first guy to credibly go after Obama on the birth
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:20.000]  certificate and the Indonesia issues we got about three four minutes left any
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:23.600]  other key developments what do you think about states moving to pass laws to
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:26.640]  force him to give him the birth certificate didn't Arizona pass that?
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.640]  Now it was introduced and the House passed it I think in the Senate didn't
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:36.720]  pass it but you can know there's a phony here because representative Posey in
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:41.280]  Florida US Congressman Republican introduced legislation that all
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:46.160]  presidential candidates of 2012 must show that their natural born status can
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:50.080]  be qualified about eight other Republicans joined in but no Democrats
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:53.320]  now why did no Democrats join in because they know he's a fraud they know
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:58.040]  he's a phony if I may give a pitch here by our website is obamacrimes.com
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:04.320]  O-B-A-M-A-C-R-I-M-E-S dot com dot com obamacrimes.com right now we need
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:07.160]  some help we need some money we're going to raise the money because we want to
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:10.600]  advertise this march since we have the date we want as many people in this
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.760]  country to be aware of this I believe people in this country do not know about
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.440]  this I think the majority of people don't know and if they did know we could
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:22.160]  have 10 million people in Washington because this is such an outrage you know
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:26.960]  there's you may differ on different policies or you know Republican ideas
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:31.120]  Democrat ideas this cross is like I'm a Democrat but this crosses everything
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:35.560]  this of course is the line completely well they can get away with this the
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:39.320]  sky is the limit well I do this I say the most important thing we have is what
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:44.040]  is the US Constitution there's nothing more important than Constitution and the
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:49.040]  305 308 million people in the country deserve to know the truth our forefathers
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:52.840]  need us to fight for this and the men and women who have served valiantly in our
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:58.400]  wars over the years 1.6 million died defending our Constitution another 1.6
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:01.520]  million have been injured and how about the millions of others who haven't who
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:05.440]  have served our nation are still serving our nation which they shouldn't be over
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:09.760]  in Iraq and Afghanistan and they are doing to defend this Constitution which
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:14.600]  Obama does not treat Obama thinks it's trash Obama's out for this new world
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:19.000]  order and the new world order will not help us so I need everyone to join with
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:24.080]  us spread the word you know such an honor to be on your show again Alex

[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:36.440]  because there's nothing more important than the US Constitution and if we bring
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:40.600]  Obama down his government health care all of it will also be reversed
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:44.280]  Philburg look forward to talking to you as the March nears God bless you thank
