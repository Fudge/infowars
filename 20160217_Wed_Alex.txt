[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:29.120]  I don't know how to start this broadcast without just being completely honest I have
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.880]  never been more concerned about the state of this country in the world I've never been
[00:35.880 --> 00:44.600]  more concerned about the state of info wars itself because every week now we are challenging
[00:44.600 --> 00:55.080]  establishment narratives and literally changing the entire debate and then winning and it's
[00:55.080 --> 01:04.560]  scary to be in many cases the lead ship in a battle smashing the enemy because that means
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.800]  they're going to train all their guns on us in fact they've already done that but because
[01:09.800 --> 01:18.240]  they're so discredited and so loathed and so hated all that does is elevate us they're losing
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.720]  the info or miserably the globalist that have occupied this country there are thousands of
[01:23.720 --> 01:31.440]  articles in the last two days thousands if you search Google news that attacked yours
[01:31.440 --> 01:41.560]  truly many times the centerpiece of the article but I was just randomly clicking on like CBS
[01:41.560 --> 01:47.560]  news pieces bashing Donald Trump for coming out questioning Scalia's death and sure enough
[01:47.560 --> 01:51.880]  I'm in that piece and I clicked an ABC piece didn't have my name on it boom I was in it
[01:51.880 --> 02:01.360]  so I say thousands folks there's 19,000 that have my name in it in the last two days but
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.560]  a lot of that's in the comments section but then there's still many others where my name
[02:06.560 --> 02:13.240]  isn't tagged on it and I'm front and center being attacked and it's the same formulaic
[02:13.240 --> 02:20.600]  I call that shaking bag like box pancakes you just pour the powder and add milk stir it
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.080]  up and cook them where it's written the same way Jones believes in aliens and vampires
[02:25.080 --> 02:32.840]  and goblins Jones is deeply racist and he says Obama himself strangled Scalia in his
[02:32.840 --> 02:42.320]  bed in southwest Texas on the Mexican border and that he also killed Leonard Nimoy and
[02:42.320 --> 02:52.400]  this is daily beast and major publications and major newspapers are completely misrepresenting
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.880]  to a level I've never seen and they're doing it in unity if you've read one of these articles
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.320]  you've read them all I've probably read let's not exaggerate couple hundred of these last
[03:02.320 --> 03:15.120]  couple days and when there's thousands you can't even keep track of it
[03:15.120 --> 03:22.240]  and then there's all these weird comments like red faced with an unfortunate pustule
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.800]  on his forehead yes I don't wear makeup and yes I was putting my bags in a cab to go to
[03:27.800 --> 03:36.120]  the airport in Cancun on a short working vacation last week and leaned forward and gouged a hole
[03:36.120 --> 03:44.400]  in my forehead and was bleeding and it's almost healed but but I got pretty good skin I love
[03:44.400 --> 03:51.840]  to fry it in the sun I'm a sun worshiper but I got good skin here but but let's say I had
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.520]  bad skin let's just say for the sake of argument I have horrible skin I mean I do have a few
[03:57.520 --> 04:05.520]  sunspots and things what does that have to do with what I'm saying and it just goes on
[04:05.520 --> 04:10.760]  from there and it's crazy kooky ugly fat dumb pustules I mean it's all these articles
[04:10.760 --> 04:18.960]  start basically the same kook nut crazy racist you insert that and then the article is the
[04:18.960 --> 04:24.200]  same when he's not talking about space aliens or blah blah blah he says that Obama murdered
[04:24.200 --> 04:31.120]  Scalia no I said it's state law and by the way we have the article in fours dot com it's
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.200]  linked on drudge report dot com it's state law that unless it's an attending physician
[04:35.200 --> 04:44.120]  you cannot waive the autopsy a judge can do that if the attending physician has waived
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.200]  it and that's what police detectives everywhere saying everybody knows is informed what's going
[04:48.200 --> 04:53.240]  on they just hope the public isn't so all we said is hey this looks really suspicious
[04:53.240 --> 04:59.120]  and the whole and the rest of the world says absolutely the police say that well it looks
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.640]  like the food isn't the only thing that's detrimental to your health at mcdonald's
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.440]  daily caller headline marine allegedly assaulted mid burger at mcdonald's as gang yelled do
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.760]  you believe black lives matter that's right a former marine became the target of an alleged
[05:11.760 --> 05:15.120]  assault mcdonald's friday night as a crowd of use cornered him and demanded he answer

[05:23.640 --> 05:27.520]  said he was dining at mcdonald's in northeast dc when a group of black teenagers came up
[05:27.520 --> 05:31.920]  to him and allegedly began harassing him about the black lives matter movement marquez ignored
[05:31.920 --> 05:35.600]  them which prompted calls and shouts that he was racist as he left the establishment
[05:35.600 --> 05:38.960]  he sustained a blow to the back of his head which knocked him unconscious when he woke
[05:38.960 --> 05:42.600]  up his pants were ripped while it gone which contained four hundred dollars in cash three
[05:42.600 --> 05:47.760]  credit cards his va medical card school id metro card and drivers license so next time

[08:15.080 --> 08:23.800]  of the info war we've warned folks for a long time that when the globalists bring in their
[08:23.800 --> 08:29.320]  planetary world government which they've almost completed it will be cashless so they can
[08:29.320 --> 08:33.480]  micromanage track everything you do and take money directly out of your accounts charge
[08:33.480 --> 08:42.160]  you for wiring your paycheck in do do bank or bailouts do all these different bail ins
[08:42.160 --> 08:46.080]  and that when they started announcing it that's when you know they're getting ready to drop
[08:46.080 --> 08:51.600]  the world economy and implode it and then roll out a new global currencies based on
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.400]  strategic drawing rights now the reason I've known this for more than a decade is the club
[08:57.400 --> 09:04.120]  of Rome the Davos group and others and leaks out of Bilderberg have been on record saying
[09:04.120 --> 09:07.840]  there's going to be a worldwide financial meltdown which they were engineering and then
[09:07.840 --> 09:13.240]  when that happened they would need a new global currency to base all currencies under so you'll
[09:13.240 --> 09:20.360]  still have your dollars or your yen or your yarn or your euros but they will be based
[09:20.360 --> 09:27.960]  in that global digital benchmark which will then give the top globalist over 100 trillion
[09:27.960 --> 09:34.320]  in excess tax money per decade that's the London Telegraph and BBC four years ago at
[09:34.320 --> 09:40.840]  Davos they agreed basically had a consensus meeting world leaders with corporate leaders
[09:40.840 --> 09:46.000]  that they would basically start phasing out cash by first getting rid of thousand dollar
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.880]  bills then hundred dollar bills and then down to one dollar bills they will ban all cash
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.880]  and they don't care they'll now run the drugs and just deliberately wire the money into
[09:56.880 --> 10:02.520]  their own accounts the big banks openly launder all the narcotics money and we're talking 98%
[10:02.520 --> 10:06.640]  of it worldwide and don't get in trouble our own trips are ordered to load the C-130s with
[10:06.640 --> 10:10.200]  the opium and heroin to fly it into Russia and the United States I mean they even have
[10:10.200 --> 10:16.960]  newscast admitting it so reality has been basically suspended common sense has been suspended
[10:16.960 --> 10:22.160]  and now Larry Summers set to be the new Fed head and many others the head of the European
[10:22.160 --> 10:27.640]  Central Bank and others have all come out in unison the last three days as well as four
[10:27.640 --> 10:33.360]  of the five global bank heads and called for banning cash in the next five years and they
[10:33.360 --> 10:40.520]  say start with the hundred dollar bill they're talking about banning the hundred euro bill
[10:40.520 --> 10:46.880]  the five hundred euro bill and more this year so it is on ladies and gentlemen claiming
[10:46.880 --> 10:52.360]  it's dirty and it's organized crime no it lets an underground economy operate in a total
[10:52.360 --> 10:59.120]  surveillance state run by the narcotics trafficking banks I mean to have Larry Summers the architect
[10:59.120 --> 11:06.200]  of the derivatives fraud the architect of the carbon taxes with Ken lay the guy with Obama's
[11:06.200 --> 11:11.680]  predecessor Bill Clinton who engineered much of what we're under lecturing us about global
[11:11.680 --> 11:22.800]  mafias is again like having a bugsy seagull or Al Capone lecture us on battling organized
[11:22.800 --> 11:30.520]  crime it is the height of over the top bizarro hypocrisy simply amazing we're gonna get into
[11:30.520 --> 11:36.640]  that it is a big deal this signifies hammerfall I mean we're in it they're gonna bring us down
[11:36.640 --> 11:40.520]  into a hardcore depression they're waiting to announce the depression we're already entering
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.880]  worldwide until after the election that's why they probably are gonna let a republican
[11:44.880 --> 11:51.120]  in so they can blame them and that's Donald Trump's biggest problem is that they'll lower
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.680]  the stock market down another 40-50% they will implode the economy further the public
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.800]  will panic and they'll go on TV and say it's Donald Trump and the conservatives faults
[12:01.800 --> 12:08.800]  and the libertarians fault and so it is now you know time to do whatever we say and set
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.560]  up this new global SDR world currency system for a new line of credit but to have it we've
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.000]  got to have carbon taxes we've got to have wellhead taxes we've got to have by the mile
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.600]  taxes in your car oh the boxes worldwide were put in 10 years ago that's gonna work perfect
[12:24.600 --> 12:28.520]  they just fell in your car by accident the smart meters just fell into your house worldwide
[12:28.520 --> 12:34.680]  by accident and this whole admitted MIT grid the tax and trace everything you do will go
[12:34.680 --> 12:40.960]  into place total surveillance total micro management you think Amazon for two years
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.920]  now can already have what you're about to order a day before boxed and ready to ship
[12:45.920 --> 12:52.880]  with 99.9999 in their own words percentage accuracy if you've been a long term user they
[12:52.880 --> 12:57.960]  know what you're gonna buy before you do what do you think they're going to have with total
[12:57.960 --> 13:05.760]  internet of things smart dust RFID third dimensional tracking software we will enter into what
[13:05.760 --> 13:15.960]  Isaac Asimov envisioned total time future and future control systems I told you this 20
[13:15.960 --> 13:21.760]  years ago was their plan because I was told this by NSA whistleblowers two years ago Google
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.160]  came out and admitted and released its founding documents from 17 years ago that they were
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.920]  set up by the CIA the Pentagon and the NSA with major industry heads to create an AI
[13:31.920 --> 13:38.920]  computer to control the reality by first predicting the future then putting stimuli in through
[13:38.920 --> 13:45.000]  the worldwide grid to control the future wide magazine last year came out with the big prize
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.320]  winning 30 page article admitting it all notice again I told you with precision exactly what
[13:52.320 --> 13:59.920]  was going on now shifting gears let's show how they play games yesterday it was 1800
[13:59.920 --> 14:05.000]  in the morning it was many many more thousands of articles attacking yours truly normally
[14:05.000 --> 14:14.800]  front and center in mainstream news newspapers CBS news ABC news Fox News everything 19 plus
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.000]  thousand as of this morning let's go to the AI computer grid for TV viewers for radio
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.320]  listeners I'll describe it let's pull up the artificially intelligent NSA interface there
[14:24.320 --> 14:31.960]  it is on screen and you've got 19,006 articles with Alex Jones Scalia and conspiracy in them
[14:31.960 --> 14:35.440]  but you have to have all those terms or to show up you can narrow it and even more come
[14:35.440 --> 14:42.440]  up you say well why is that because then it targets him on the specifics now what do they
[14:42.440 --> 14:49.720]  do in all of the articles mixed together kook nut crazy violent racist in the headline then
[14:49.720 --> 14:57.240]  they say in a blurry video with a pustule on his head and ugly red skin he said Obama
[14:57.240 --> 15:05.000]  strangled Anthony Scalia in his bed and then they go on to make the next joke and Jones
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.480]  so ignorant can't even get his name right and then Scalia that's like saying I can't
[15:11.480 --> 15:19.920]  get my name right my name is Alexander I go by Alex he went by Anthony Anthony is the
[15:19.920 --> 15:27.280]  English translation of the Latin Anthony Scalia and guys I asked you to pull it up you please
[15:27.280 --> 15:34.400]  put up Anthony on screen for folks that is the that is the Latin of Anthony so it's like
[15:34.400 --> 15:40.080]  if you have a guy I mean I'm talking about his name Jesus and then I anglicized it and
[15:40.080 --> 15:45.440]  say he's Jesus it's the same spelling same thing with this is basically saying this is
[15:45.440 --> 15:49.160]  the games they play ladies and gentlemen it's like oh he couldn't even get his name right
[15:49.160 --> 16:00.240]  it's Alexander not Alex Anthony in Latin and then it goes to break it down that it is Anthony
[16:00.240 --> 16:04.600]  you go into Spanish Antonio a whole bunch of different translations of it but but it's
[16:04.600 --> 16:11.280]  it's it's anglicizing but yes Anthony Scalia Anthony Scalia the point is this is the games
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.960]  they play I said it's suspicious how they announced everything right away said nothing
[16:15.960 --> 16:22.600]  suspicious told us he was real sick when that is what his doctor actually said then I said
[16:22.600 --> 16:27.240]  if they don't have an autopsy and they announce it really quick that they're not you know
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.760]  the fix is in boom next morning that happened now they've got head detectives current and
[16:32.760 --> 16:38.880]  former all over the news prominent detectives the heads of squads we can put those on screen
[16:38.880 --> 16:46.320]  I saw it in a CBS news piece ABC news piece it was in New York Post saying you always
[16:46.320 --> 16:50.600]  have an autopsy of someone prominent like this and you certainly don't announce it right
[16:50.600 --> 16:58.960]  away this is incredibly suspicious detectives question lack of autopsy and Scalia's death
[16:58.960 --> 17:05.600]  these are head forensics and homicide division detectives in DC in New York and other major
[17:05.600 --> 17:12.000]  cities and you read the quotes quote I'm dumbfounded quote I almost fell out of my
[17:12.000 --> 17:21.040]  chair I couldn't believe it why would you not do an autopsy or why would you instantly
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.480]  announce such a rush to not have one because you're just going to put him in the vehicle
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.680]  to sideward ascending under jurisdiction send it there and then the medical examiner comes
[17:31.680 --> 17:37.280]  in and and looks at him you can say oh he may have died in his bed he was all but you
[17:37.280 --> 17:43.120]  don't say oh cause of the death natural because I'm a judge you didn't even see the body I
[17:43.120 --> 17:48.720]  talked to somebody on the telephone here's one of the detectives says so I think under
[17:48.720 --> 17:53.600]  the circumstances it's not unreasonable to request an autopsy despite the fact that he
[17:53.600 --> 17:58.000]  has preexisting ailments of the fact that he's almost 80 years old you want to be sure that's
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.320]  not something other than natural causes he's not at home there are no witnesses
[18:03.680 --> 18:09.200]  so I come out and I say man this is just perfect timing the key person at the key time doesn't
[18:09.200 --> 18:16.960]  have a security detail he dies then they don't have an autopsy they taking hundreds of miles away
[18:16.960 --> 18:23.040]  they act super suspicious they dump his fluids down the drain you know at the funeral home
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.160]  and we send reporters down there to talk to the judges to talk to the funeral home we have all
[18:28.160 --> 18:34.240]  the interviews they're up on info wars.com all of this happens we're doing real journalism
[18:34.960 --> 18:39.840]  I'm here as a pundit though pointing out our journalism our research and and getting upset
[18:39.840 --> 18:46.880]  about it and their response is he has a big pustule on his head I had a small cut on my head
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.320]  from hitting it on a trunk of a car of a taxi cab the guy opened it too quick when I was leaning

[24:44.960 --> 24:54.080]  you know for larry nickels own safety i don't i don't give up people's sources here on air
[24:55.040 --> 24:59.040]  but larry nickels was obviously very well known in the whole clinton regime and then in the early
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.880]  years of the clinton white house was there in dc exposing him and he did talk to a supreme court
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.480]  justice that was looking into all of this and an hour and a half after he talked to that supreme
[25:10.480 --> 25:17.520]  court justice and he was on our show a black suv came up his rural road and parked in front of his
[25:17.520 --> 25:25.360]  house we've been there and interviewed him before he got a photo of it and then he called the police
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.560]  and they went and they were department of homeland security and uh so the police uh
[25:30.560 --> 25:36.080]  basically said that uh that's that when nickels goes out they drive off when he goes back in
[25:36.080 --> 25:43.440]  they drive back up uh that is going on and he is still awaiting the call back from a supreme court
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.200]  justice uh just to give folks a hint because this is what he said we could say from clarence
[25:49.200 --> 25:56.480]  thomas to him in 1970 congress passed a law that said a president in his last year of his last term
[25:57.120 --> 26:01.760]  cannot appoint a recess supreme court justice except under one condition there's a crisis
[26:01.760 --> 26:08.160]  when the court itself they're now billing this as a crisis since scalia died you now have a court
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.760]  that is four to four ballgame i know we all know this this is from clarence thomas so obama can
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.560]  appoint what is called an emergency appointment what is the criteria of an emergency appointment
[26:18.560 --> 26:24.160]  approval who killed scalia supreme court was in the middle of dealing with the syrian refugee issue
[26:24.160 --> 26:28.880]  whether to make them legal this is now being held up by scalia's death obama may be able to
[26:28.880 --> 26:33.600]  appoint an emergency court justice if he wants to make holder his emergency court appointment
[26:35.200 --> 26:42.080]  obama will most probably claim holder and lynch that have since they've already gone through the
[26:42.080 --> 26:47.600]  strenuous approval process to oversee the justice department can be assigned by him by passing congress
[26:49.840 --> 26:52.480]  the 1970 law was reaffirmed by schumer
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.720]  n07 that is from clarence thomas according to larry nickles
[27:01.600 --> 27:06.640]  and we have other very credible people like matt drudge talking to a certain supreme court
[27:06.640 --> 27:11.040]  justice at dinner saying they were going to drop the hammer this year and come after everybody
[27:11.040 --> 27:21.280]  in our free speech and 19 000 news articles around the world are making fun of us but the police
[27:21.280 --> 27:27.760]  detectives now from california to new york to dc are in the news
[27:30.720 --> 27:36.320]  saying it is preposterous in fact i saw some of the video on a cbs report it's like trump
[27:36.960 --> 27:42.160]  trump you know question scalia death cbs news if you google it from last night and then i'm in there
[27:42.160 --> 27:46.880]  but at the end they had one of the head uh detectives from new york in fact the head of the
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.360]  department saying it's ridiculous it's always a murder scene especially with a public figure
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.240]  you don't just instantly announce it anyway something's going on here
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.920]  yeah stuff like this has never happened before imagine if obama died and they said he had a pillow
[28:02.720 --> 28:11.920]  over his head and that's what poindexter the friend of obama the big donor of obama
[28:11.920 --> 28:18.000]  said when he found him he had a pillow quote over his head and he told that the three different
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.680]  newspapers but don't worry now they're making fun of us in hundreds of publications hundreds i saw
[28:24.320 --> 28:25.680]  saying justice calia
[28:28.880 --> 28:36.080]  was not found with a pillow over his face it was above his head so see it's not that they've
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.880]  changed their story now it's that we were wrong to actually quote him oh did i mention they said
[28:42.880 --> 28:50.080]  i had a sunburn in the video and i had a quote hustle how about bubonic plague on my head how
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.080]  about aids let's make it worse you know a tiny cut from from the edge of a trump that was opened
[28:56.080 --> 29:03.280]  as i was leaning over it i think we've all done that no no no my crime is i had a millimeter and a
[29:03.280 --> 29:08.320]  half cut on my head that's already already healed in fact can we can we zoom in on the
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.400]  pustule for the news they can maybe make a maybe have a few thousand news stories about that and
[29:12.400 --> 29:19.360]  then just look at how diseased i am how ugly i am that i don't even wear makeup on tv i mean i am
[29:19.360 --> 29:25.920]  just oh my gosh look at it yeah how about a story about all my sun damage how much i love it look

[29:51.760 --> 29:54.640]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:54.640 --> 30:03.920]  we now have a magic pillow theory this is a pillow that starts off on the face of scalia
[30:03.920 --> 30:10.160]  and then moves to above his head exclusive just a scalia was not found with a pillow over his face
[30:10.160 --> 30:16.000]  it was above his head reveal sheriff who was first on the scene when he wasn't it took him 30 minutes
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.040]  to get there after he received the call for city o county sheriff danie dominguez told daily mail
[30:21.040 --> 30:25.920]  that the pillow was in fact above his head and there was nothing fishy about his death now let's
[30:25.920 --> 30:30.720]  look back at what john pointexter cibolo creek ranch owner said to my san Antonio when he found
[30:30.720 --> 30:36.240]  scalia we discovered the judge in bed a pillow over his head said pointexter do you believe the man
[30:36.240 --> 30:41.040]  who entered the room first saw the body first and then contacted the authorities first or do we
[30:41.040 --> 30:45.520]  believe the sheriff who arrived 30 minutes after he received a phone call and now has had two or three
[30:45.520 --> 30:49.360]  days to think about what he has to say this latest article from daily mail will now have

[33:58.080 --> 34:04.240]  on the scalia situation the anthony scalia situation or let me use the latin antinence
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.760]  calia same thing in american jesus hasus potato patata that's the media playing game saying i
[34:09.760 --> 34:14.880]  got his name wrong that's not what happened he went by anthony with many people speaking of anthony
[34:14.880 --> 34:21.280]  anthony gucciardi we'll be hosting uh the fourth hour today or it may be due because a bunch of
[34:21.280 --> 34:24.640]  stuff to come up and we're in the middle of where you know some really really big stories
[34:24.640 --> 34:33.360]  uh right now before i do that um i want to just be clear that
[34:37.280 --> 34:41.600]  i'm not saying that mr poindexter had anything to do
[34:44.960 --> 34:49.040]  with calia's death because he looks completely dumbfounded and freaked out
[34:49.040 --> 34:56.800]  he had 30 people there that were guessed you had over 100 people there that work there
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.320]  there's all sorts of you know crazy people that could have even acted on their own
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.120]  who knows and i'm not saying that's the case the timing the way it was handled the way they
[35:07.120 --> 35:12.400]  did want an autopsy right away the way they said no foul play right away all of it stinks to high
[35:12.400 --> 35:17.920]  heaven but i don't know why he would then say there was a pillow over his face if he was somehow
[35:17.920 --> 35:24.000]  involved so i want to be clear people are innocent until proven guilty and i don't think that mr
[35:24.720 --> 35:30.160]  poindexter is a suspect i think the whole situation is suspect and should have been
[35:30.160 --> 35:37.440]  investigated and that's what guys will you reprint me the uh new york post but it's also in the la
[35:37.440 --> 35:43.440]  times you name it because i want to read those quotes from head detectives homicide detectives
[35:43.440 --> 35:48.080]  heads crime scene directors i mean there's a whole bunch of them now there were like two
[35:48.080 --> 35:53.360]  or three a few days ago now i've seen more than 10 in the news alone i'm saying this is crazy
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.960]  this looks like a cover-up i mean i took some criminology classes i read a lot of crime books
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.200]  i watch a lot of crime shows on tv you know the real world ones not the fiction ones
[36:05.920 --> 36:10.240]  everybody knows this is default stuff being ignored i'm not a cop though i'm not a head
[36:10.240 --> 36:15.440]  detective homicide detective and they're saying this that they almost quote fell out of their chairs
[36:15.440 --> 36:22.160]  were quote dumbfounded couldn't believe it these are the exact quotes of every one of them dumbfounded
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.720]  almost fell out of my chair almost unbelievable couldn't believe it that that's four different
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.360]  quotes from four different detectives in two different articles i've read couldn't believe it
[36:33.200 --> 36:37.680]  and then i'm demonized for being the first person to come out and say they're saying
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.960]  looks like no foul play right away and they're not giving out any details and they didn't tell
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.240]  the world till seven hours after he was found and obama knew two hours after and the whole thing
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.480]  looks weird and they say locals have taken over the investigation when it's a high-level federal
[36:52.480 --> 37:00.320]  officer their statutes that the feds are over all this is ignored you have a judge saying i
[37:00.320 --> 37:05.520]  determined all this without looking at him and i said if they say no autopsy in the morning
[37:05.520 --> 37:12.560]  red flags folks and then that happened and now they say oh it wasn't a pillow on the head it was
[37:12.560 --> 37:20.240]  behind the head hanging over give me a break give me a break and you say well if it was foul play
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.480]  why would you leave the pillow there to be obvious that's a message if that's what happened
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.520]  and that's what the police and former cia people and former army intelligence people are saying
[37:31.520 --> 37:37.120]  because that's the exact thing you do to send a message now we're going to go to an amazing
[37:38.000 --> 37:46.320]  two-minute confrontation that david night had with this judge cinderella that's her
[37:46.320 --> 37:54.640]  cinderella story fairy tale here in just a moment judge cinderella guvera and nobody else
[37:54.640 --> 37:58.320]  to go talk to michael savages said two days ago you know where's the coward media who's
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.280]  going to go down there and talk to him well we got five reporters down there right now
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.200]  Wayne madson david night joe biggs kit daniels and our camera guy josh owens all doing a fabulous
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.040]  job putting their lives on the line believe me this is dangerous stuff and the fact that they
[38:11.040 --> 38:16.480]  got a dhs suv out there and the police came out there yesterday and larry nickles house
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.080]  they got his phones listened to and they are scared to death of who he was talking to that day
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.280]  reportedly and are out there just waiting and then obviously they probably went and got to the
[38:27.280 --> 38:34.320]  justice i mean this this country is in a lot of trouble folks this country this is an internal coup
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.960]  by the globalists going on by foreign banking institutions they admit they've taken over spain
[38:38.960 --> 38:47.200]  portugal italy greece cyprus that they're taking ukraine the globalists are taking over financially
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.840]  so i want to go to the intro of a report that john bound file that's very powerful at info wars.com
[38:53.840 --> 38:59.120]  um just a minute or so of it it's a six and a half minute report no autopsy for scalia
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.560]  yet autopsies for illegals all illegals found dead on or around the texas border here it is
[39:06.160 --> 39:13.520]  what can he do to me or to any of us we have life tenured and we have it precisely so that
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.640]  we will not be influenced by by politics by threats from from anybody
[39:18.640 --> 39:25.920]  what the hell is this that's a city message it means local brassy sleeps with the fishes
[39:28.960 --> 39:34.640]  and then of course you've got in godfather too the guy trying to kill the jewish gangster
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.240]  sneaking around with his pillow wanting to suffocate him in the hospital
[39:42.160 --> 39:46.240]  and that's why everybody's asking questions and so what you see is this lie crashing down
[39:46.240 --> 39:52.320]  that we're not allowed to ask questions and that we don't believe known liars and no obama says
[39:52.320 --> 39:59.840]  i'm good at killing people hillary says i came we saw he died i mean they'll order our troops
[39:59.840 --> 40:07.120]  left in Benghazi of course they'll pull stuff this this is the clinton's everything standing
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.520]  again he just shot down with a ruling trillions in carbon taxes in the next decade he just killed
[40:13.520 --> 40:20.320]  it the only deciding key vote to stop it and wrote the opinion a week before dead dead that's not
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.120]  suspicious trillions hanging in the balance top judge dies nothing suspicious you're crazy to ask
[40:25.120 --> 40:30.080]  questions and all they could say is space aliens how long does the sun burn he has a boil on his
[40:30.080 --> 40:35.840]  head you know just all this bull just just shaken back this is the best you've got to offer we're
[40:35.840 --> 40:44.640]  going to david night but first ladies and gentlemen info wars is the tip of the spear in the fight

[44:40.560 --> 44:47.280]  reporters when questioned on the procedures and there's another article that's linked to drudge
[44:47.280 --> 44:54.480]  report dot com where kit daniels talks to the other judge and they go over the code the state
[44:54.480 --> 45:00.880]  code because you have to have an attending physician who's basically on the medical facility
[45:00.880 --> 45:05.280]  that you're at to be able to say they think the cause of death is natural without an autopsy and
[45:05.280 --> 45:11.040]  still the judge can disregard that but no this is just they claim somebody there said everything
[45:11.040 --> 45:17.120]  was fine over a telephone this is unprecedented and so night doesn't put up with them saying
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.280]  you know you can't talk to the judge you like old-fashioned reporters like a gumshoe like a
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.560]  mickey spelane with our great crew he bulls his way in there and ask her real questions and here
[45:26.560 --> 45:34.560]  is that dramatic true journalism i want to see you my name is david night
[45:44.000 --> 45:49.840]  hi i had a quick question we're looking for us my name is david night i had a couple of
[45:49.840 --> 45:53.360]  questions going back and forth between the sheriff i wasn't really clear how the federal
[45:53.360 --> 45:58.960]  marshals were involved because the press reports that i've seen our conversations back and forth
[45:58.960 --> 46:06.080]  between you and the sheriff but i was trying to tie down a timeline as to who was involved about
[46:06.080 --> 46:10.560]  point who made the decisions not due to autopsy was that something the federal marshals were
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.760]  involved in i've given a statement to the defense that's an all you'll have to go to them they have
[46:15.760 --> 46:24.560]  my official statements so they're your spokesman so if you'd like to get that i understand this is
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.200]  a story of national importance and there's a lot of people who are very concerned that procedures
[46:29.200 --> 46:34.400]  are not followed and they want to know who's who was making that decision was that something
[46:34.400 --> 46:37.920]  the sheriff was doing or is it something the federal marshals were doing is it something you
[46:37.920 --> 46:45.360]  were doing procedure was followed and they have a statement okay thank you
[46:50.400 --> 46:54.720]  here you see she doesn't want to talk about what's happened here and we understand why
[46:56.800 --> 47:05.200]  usual usual procedure you've got a judge who over the phone pronounces the supreme court justice
[47:05.200 --> 47:12.400]  is dead we don't need to see anything it's all done you had two judges who passed this on because
[47:12.400 --> 47:17.600]  they couldn't physically go she doesn't think it's important enough to go she says we can talk to the
[47:17.600 --> 47:22.400]  local paper i don't know if it's a livestock paper what it is to get their statements she's
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.480]  given them a statement she's not going to talk to anyone else except the local paper so she's
[47:26.480 --> 47:30.720]  addressing under the news paper but she doesn't have a relationship with us she doesn't want us
[47:30.720 --> 47:36.000]  to ask her any questions that's what this is all about and don't worry none of the other
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.280]  prostitute media will ask any real questions as well but we have the article up on info wars
[47:41.280 --> 47:47.760]  dot com it's also on drudge report dot com scalia death judge likely violated law scalia was not
[47:47.760 --> 47:52.480]  expected to die at any moment that's a lie too notice all this is just injected in there they've
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.480]  changed the story they said it was a heart attack it wasn't joining us now over the phone he's been
[47:56.480 --> 48:00.320]  out at the ranch they're gonna leave soon and go upload all the incredible video they've got there's
[48:00.320 --> 48:04.800]  no internet out there they're now at the ranch where scalia died they were able to tweet out some
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.760]  photos i noticed we can pull those up that it's totally deserted uh and it's business as usual
[48:09.760 --> 48:14.880]  it looks like joining us is david night david great job when they outside said no she's not
[48:14.880 --> 48:19.520]  going to talk to you to fill in the rest of the story uh you know talk to the paper you want to
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.880]  head and win in so good job david thank you alex hello let me give you a little bit of context
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.920]  with that as well we've gone before we talked to you yesterday live on the radio we've gone to the
[48:29.920 --> 48:34.480]  judge's office and talked to the secretary she was not very encouraging to never get an interview
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.960]  with her but uh my number and would not make an appointment wouldn't tell us so you didn't just
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.120]  bull in the first time you didn't just bull in there you know and you were very polite but you
[48:43.120 --> 48:49.120]  were very forceful exactly that's what people would need to understand and then after we had
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.560]  done the interview with you on the radio uh we were standing on the main street of town and walking
[48:54.560 --> 48:59.200]  down the sidewalk was this secretary and so i approached her again i said any more news as to
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.120]  when we might be able to talk to the judge so well the judge isn't going to talk to anyone
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.960]  she's trying to release all of her information through big bend now which is this little teeny
[49:08.960 --> 49:14.640]  tiny paper down the sidewalk on this one street they've got and so i said look this is you know
[49:14.640 --> 49:17.840]  same thing i said her this is the story of national importance i'm trying to establish
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.800]  timeline i want to know who made these decisions when they made them were the us marshals involved
[49:22.800 --> 49:27.040]  why hasn't the fbi said something about this but what kind of federal involvement have you had
[49:27.040 --> 49:32.560]  because the only thing i see here is this back and forth doing the inquest over the phone with
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.960]  this judge and the sheriff who also would not talk to us to try to talk to the sheriff as well
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.920]  and by the way we're showing incredible drone footage of the super luxury ranch wow i'd like
[49:41.920 --> 49:46.320]  to stay there but i don't have the money to wow that place is incredible it's got a huge

[49:52.560 --> 49:57.360]  quiet i think we're the only that's here right now but uh she she left and when she left josh
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.240]  said you know the the judge might be over there in her office now so well let's go and so that's
[50:02.240 --> 50:06.160]  what happened before that we'd already been given a brush off quite we knew she wasn't going to talk
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.240]  to us and i just wanted to talk to her and let her know that we know what's going on and you know
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.320]  alex what's happening with it is the same thing in microcosm that we see on the national level
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.800]  you got the politicians and their favored media and they're the only ones that they'll talk to
[50:20.800 --> 50:25.200]  and so you know you get this little tiny paper which is like a penny saver uh type of paper
[50:25.200 --> 50:30.000]  they're just running local ads uh and people selling stuff that's the only people that she
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.440]  will talk to we're supposed to get all of our information from them and of course they're not
[50:33.440 --> 50:40.000]  going to ask her any they're not going to ask her anything to send David stay there you deserve a

[54:43.120 --> 54:48.560]  attack coming but our governments opened up our borders they've now openly admit that much of
[54:48.560 --> 54:52.560]  europe's under martial law that's mainstream news today they're basically saying yeah it's called
[54:52.560 --> 54:58.640]  a civil emergency but it's martial law a permanent emergency to deal with the radical muslims they
[54:58.640 --> 55:04.640]  brought in and i always tried to figure out hey they're bringing these people in when they attack
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.160]  what's gonna happen aren't the politicians gonna get in trouble no they're gonna be held as heroes
[55:10.160 --> 55:16.880]  like george w bush who didn't protect us on 9 11 let it happen bare minimum 28 pages proves that
[55:16.880 --> 55:23.360]  donald trump has the courage i mean he just went from like 95 with me to like 99 right there i admire
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.600]  him his courage they say oh he sounds like a liberal democrat he doesn't sound like a liberal
[55:27.600 --> 55:33.440]  democrat he sounds like a truth teller they did let us get attacked bare minimum going back to day to
[55:33.440 --> 55:39.200]  night uh just incredible i had no idea how gorgeous that ranch is down there i know a lot of folks
[55:39.200 --> 55:42.800]  want to go there obviously sure i'm plugging how beautiful it is you know for the folks that we've
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.080]  been uh critical of because the whole thing needs to be investigated i'm not saying any one person
[55:48.080 --> 55:54.640]  i think it's a suspect david i want to just say the whole thing sounds like an aga christy novel
[55:54.640 --> 56:00.720]  this stinks to high heaven other points david night yeah alex uh you know anybody could have
[56:00.720 --> 56:05.680]  done this one of the interesting things about this so tell us it is so far out so isolated
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.920]  there's not a bit it could have been the mexican mafia and i'm not saying they did it i'm just saying
[56:09.920 --> 56:16.960]  it could be anybody this is a very very high crime area yeah there's no room keys you can't lock your
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.880]  room once you leave it you can latch it while you're in there and they've got a key they can
[56:20.880 --> 56:25.920]  open up that latch but there's not any any room key that you can lock your valuables away or lock
[56:25.920 --> 56:31.360]  up your room when you're not there and by the way folks i want to be clear when i when i am out over
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.640]  the years for security i don't do it because i'm a coward i do it because i know how they operate
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.440]  they kill you when you're on the road i've barricade my doors when i'm sleeping alone on a mission go
[56:39.440 --> 56:44.320]  ahead sorry well i'm just going to say the other things is you know there's no phone in the room
[56:44.320 --> 56:49.440]  i mean if you uh are are sick and you need some help or something there's no phone to call them
[56:49.440 --> 56:53.040]  and i thought it was very interesting when we checked in they had each and every one of us
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.480]  sign a release statement acknowledging that we are hours away from any kind of medical care
[56:58.480 --> 57:01.920]  i've never had that happen at a hotel either that's say that i don't know if that's something
[57:01.920 --> 57:06.720]  they did after the galeas or if that's a procedure we're going to ask them if that's
[57:06.720 --> 57:11.840]  something that's new well i gotta say i mean i don't normally just sit here and gush about a
[57:11.840 --> 57:16.960]  great job you guys are doing a great job and also kit getting in there and and and just all of you
[57:17.680 --> 57:21.200]  but kit getting in there and talking to the other judge and having the judge on audio admit
[57:21.200 --> 57:25.360]  yeah i mean i tried to get out there you know do my job and actually see the body but we didn't
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.720]  and we've got some amazing admissions here david oh yeah absolutely and that's the key
[57:30.720 --> 57:35.360]  alex is that everybody's looking at this to say the process does not make any sense
[57:35.920 --> 57:40.720]  and we need to understand who made the decisions when these decisions were made
[57:40.720 --> 57:45.360]  why wasn't their involvement at the federal level it was known for a very long time before
[57:45.360 --> 57:50.000]  they destroyed the evidence by doing an involving of the body it was known for a very long time
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.880]  who this was and and so that's the questions that everybody has and then when they clam up
[57:54.880 --> 57:59.680]  they won't talk to anybody they give us uh you know because you could you could argue that it's
[57:59.680 --> 58:05.040]  semantics about the pillow whatever but they won't talk to people about it then it makes it look
[58:05.040 --> 58:08.560]  even more suspicious that's what we're looking at i thought it was ironic we went into the judge's
[58:08.560 --> 58:15.840]  office the only picture she had on the wall was a very large portrait of jfk how ironic is that i
[58:15.840 --> 58:21.280]  mean i've only come back in time here you know if it's kind of conspiracy don't you know move along
[58:21.280 --> 58:24.880]  there's nothing to see here i'm surprised they didn't go further and just say that jfk died
[58:24.880 --> 58:28.800]  of natural causes because they did that with beniz armudo and they shot her up in a motorcade and
[58:28.800 --> 58:34.480]  that's the the new thing is just that they may deny that's that's calia uh anthony's calia

[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:35.120]  see if he concurs we've got massive election news more on scalia uh david night was just joining
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.760]  us he was able to confront the judge that over the telephone decided he died of a heart attack
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:46.240]  because there's some unnamed person she talked to we've got a report up on info wars dot com
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:50.880]  where it is now being reported that the judge likely violated the law
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:58.160]  and the police detectives across the country senior ones the heads of heads of departments
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:03.120]  heads of divisions coming out and saying this is ridiculous of course we should question this
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.920]  this standard operating procedures been changed they lied to know in texas you can do this
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:14.640]  yeah if there's an attending physician they have violated the code in my view and i've read the code
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:21.360]  but right now let's go back to uh our reporters let's go to kit daniels now and get his brief
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:25.200]  take on this and i'm gonna let him continue to file articles and get these hd videos up
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:30.000]  as soon as they get back to an internet area uh but uh kit daniels vesca journals joins us
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.600]  and we'll talk for a few minutes to bigs and the next segment get his view on this and we're
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:40.080]  going to go to max keiser uh kit what do you have to say well i you know i find it funny how the uh
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:46.240]  local sheriff i think david abingas he's only really interested in talking to the media when it
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:52.240]  comes time to cover his butt he wouldn't talk to us yesterday i think i might have saw him yesterday
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:57.280]  across the town square i wasn't quite sure he kind of glanced at me and then he he went the other
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:03.760]  direction and and then it's like but then now i see this article in the daily mail it came out
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.120]  interviewing him like shooting you know the people attacking him for his involvement in the handling
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:14.400]  of the situation and also just be specific who you're talking about because your phone broke
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:18.480]  up a little bit and then i want to talk about point dexter have you seen point dexter anywhere
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:24.960]  out there the owner no i haven't it just it as far as i know that this property is uh managed by a
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:31.280]  uh hospitality management service out of houston so i think point dexter probably shows up for a
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:37.200]  big guess when they come into town all right continuing who is this you're saying you you
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:45.920]  shan try to talk to oh it was dany domingas the county sheriff yes and it's it's i find it funny
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:51.520]  he was uh on the daily mail he was talking about how he was mad at the dc homicide detective about
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:56.080]  how he's making a political whole situation with the supreme court justice of course it's
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:02.320]  political a and b why does this county sheriff care if it's political he's a county sheriff in
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:09.920]  our most region of west texas so why does he even care that the whole death of the supreme court
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:17.280]  justice is now political i mean what's his skin in the game well the it just and i the sheriff
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:22.480]  who showed up later after point dexter says he found him with it over his face says it was
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:27.440]  above his head well obviously they moved it to see if he was alive but but now boy this sheriff
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:33.840]  sure is a big helper isn't he yeah and alex the pillows in my room they were just really lumpy
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:38.720]  they're not like the really firm pillows you find out holiday in so it's like i'm assuming if
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:44.880]  if they're the same pillows used in the suite the spalea was used was in i mean i just don't see
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:50.000]  how a pillow could be of that lumpy sure it sounds like it was goose goose down that's what the fancy
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.080]  pants folks like here's the bottom line you guys should shoot a reenactment in there and you know
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.400]  you know basically show what happened obviously you're going to show what room we believed he was in
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:05.040]  and see if there's a crime scene tape there the i bet there's not even crime scene tape i mean
[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.760]  there'd be a crime scene if a homeless person had been stabbed but i tell you there's also a john
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:15.840]  bound reported as you first pointed out illegals uh all of them get an autopsy when they're found
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:22.400]  dead in that area but not the supreme court justice yeah exactly exactly and also found a uh
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:28.320]  one of uh denny's dominos county sheriff one of his former employees i think is now bringing a
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:36.000]  lawsuit against him over some reported wrongdoing he's claiming that this uh he was told to give a
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:42.720]  return of firearms this uh the suspect who had a protective order against him because of uh uh
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:47.600]  marriage abuse and you know denny was basically called him on telephone tell him hey no just
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:51.920]  get the you know just go ahead and just get back to him you know it's not a big deal it's a bfk
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:55.840]  against him well well i mean here's the deal i don't believe there's any corruption in south
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:05:02.720]  texas on the mexican border bernie sanders a bum who didn't earn his first steady paycheck until age
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:07.280]  40 then warmed his way into politics that's the title of a gateway pundit article by jim
[1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:11.840]  hoff featured on info wars dot com and now let's take a look at the work history of the current
[1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:16.800]  socialist democratic nominee hopeful one of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:20.960]  and it was all downhill from there hoff writes penniless he went on unemployment desperately
[1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:25.520]  he tried carpentry but can barely sink a nail he was a blank carpenter a friend told political
[1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:30.160]  magazine then he tried his hand at freelancing for leftist rags writing about masturbation and
[1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:35.920]  rape for $50 a story they did say the only thing he was good at was talking nonstop about socialism
[1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:40.640]  and how the rich were ripping everybody off so he tried politics starting his own socialist party
[1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:45.040]  four times he ran and lost badly for vermont public office finally he warmed his way into the
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:50.400]  senate in 2006 the choice of this election is shaping up to be a very clear one it is really
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:55.200]  a war between capitalism and socialism rob dew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars

[1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:31.520]  political activist uh dealing with bits of freedom a dutch nonprofit dedicated to online
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:38.160]  privacy you notice all this talk going on about apple won't give up the codes so that they can get
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.280]  into the uh phone of one of the san bernadino jihadis ladies and gentlemen they have ways to
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:48.320]  break that you can break that on the street it's pure bull they want to set a precedent for apple
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:53.040]  to give all their encryption up which then puts back doors and everything and one reason apple
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:58.240]  products do work better in my experience than uh pc-based droids and we're going to talk about this
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:03.600]  is because they're wide open with more holes in them and i believe i don't like the company apple
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:09.760]  themselves or their anti-gun politics but that's just a fact we're going to max keiser and his
[1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:14.160]  guest who's joining us here in just a few minutes i've got to finish up with our reporters on the
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:21.520]  ground at the ranch the 30 000 acre ranch in southwest texas where the supreme court justice
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:27.040]  who just ruled against carbon taxes and was about to rule four guns and four sovereignty has magically
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:32.160]  died and we got some bad news i expected this republicans are now saying they're going to go
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:35.760]  ahead and cave in and let obama just basically have whoever he wants will probably be the former
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:42.320]  attorney general uh eric holder or the current one and uh miss lynch so that is a nightmare scenario
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:49.520]  both anti-free speech both anti-gun anti-sovereignty uh this is the takedown of the country grassley
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:54.880]  leaves open idea of supreme court hearing for confirmation when they can clearly i mean they
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:10:00.800]  blocked bush i've got clips of obama uh you know trying to you know block people and he was a senator
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:06.080]  saying it's okay in the last year gop showing signs of backing down from a vow to block
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:13.840]  the supreme court pick of the president uh so that's it folks that's being reported by uh the la
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:20.720]  times the washington times and bloomberg politics and others so we're going to be getting to all of
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:26.320]  that and more coming up but just finishing up very quickly with our reporters kit daniels
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:31.920]  recapping anything else you didn't add i want to get a word from joe begs well i have to point out
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:37.120]  it would seem like it'd be in point dexter's best interest to have called for an autopsy himself
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:42.400]  from the legal standpoint i mean when you have a someone who dies unexpectedly on your property
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:46.560]  you're going to want to know what happened exactly no you're not just one going to want to assume
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:53.040]  something for legal revolutions what the justice of the peace the uh wanted a bishop told me yesterday
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:58.960]  was the county will normally perform autopsies on unexpected deaths because the county needs
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:05.360]  no for sure they don't want to they cannot it just leaves open this huge hole uh legally
[1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:13.760]  for them to just assume things absolutely it's just yeah it's just it's just this whole thing
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:18.640]  just stinks the high heaven as a cover up and the way they're saying don't be political and the
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:24.400]  sheriff's countering about the pillow later and then no autopsy all of it any other points and i'm
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:28.880]  going to go to bigs briefly yeah yeah just the county sheriff it is those are talking points
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:31.840]  from the bomb administration it sounds like something that i would expect a big bend county
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:37.360]  sheriff to talk about very well said please continue your reportage uh it's up at info wars.com
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:42.800]  and prisonplanet.com uh let's go to joe begs here uh joe begs of course is our military uh
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:47.680]  correspondent with background on uh serious issues like that because of all the serious
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:52.400]  combat he's been a decorated soldier also in fours investigative journalists uh kind of
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:58.240]  recapping what they've covered what stands out most of you joe begs well one of the most interesting
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:02.560]  things alex that happened yesterday after we got off the interview with uh yourself you and my
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:08.240]  savage we began our journey here to the sabola creek ranch as we pulled up we got out and uh
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:13.760]  david wanted to shoot a quick video as we pulled up two vehicles with sheriff's stickers on the back
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:20.160]  one coming from uh uh pertisio and then the other one from marfa both showed up simultaneously stopped
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:25.680]  behind our vehicle got out and we're basically watching it as we're shooting this video we drive
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:30.160]  into the ranch check in and we speak to the property manager his name's george he's a
[1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:36.320]  longtime friend of uh point dexter he's been managing this place for about 15 years he used to own the
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:43.360]  the driscoll in austin texas and at first he was very hospitable he talked to us and uh was fine
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:48.160]  we walk away and i'm assuming he probably asked about our names and then the research to we were
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:54.080]  then the mood changed i came in here last night and i was the first one of the uh the dinner area
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:59.200]  there's like an area at 6 30 day it's a family style atmosphere so everyone that stays here has to
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.080]  eat at the same place same table and it's all scheduled out when you need for breakfast lunch
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:09.760]  and dinner so we get out there i sit down uh grab a drink and i'm having some shrimp cocktails that
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:14.160]  they're out and then the george guy walks in the property manager and i said hey how's he going sir

[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:36.640]  you're spreading conspiracy theories and then he kind of looks back at me and uh i'm the only one
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.880]  in the in the dinner area at that time i'm just kind of sitting there waiting past time because
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:44.400]  this place is really eerie it's out in the middle of nowhere it's kind of like being on the set of
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:51.360]  the shiny and he he sits there and says that so then we sit down for dinner time it's the four
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.360]  of us on the other end of the table there are seven or eight people from that spiderwood uh

[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:11.520]  and a tv host and there's been a model and we're going to get into all that in the balance of the
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.800]  hour we're also going to get into larry summers launches the war on paper money says it's time
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.640]  to kill the hundred dollar bill the head of the european central bank says get rid of the 500 note
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:25.440]  and then on down why do they want to get rid of cash well that's a very very important point and why
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:30.800]  are they saying it now so there's so much to discuss uh with what's happening in the world economy
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:38.080]  as well as that unravels as max keiser uh has uh predicted and so much more we got the death of the
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:43.120]  mainstream media we'll be looking at that uh so uh max it's it's usually you and stacey we have on
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:48.960]  we just had you on two weeks ago from red square uh there at the kremlin amazing interview a news
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:53.760]  making interview a lot of key intel you broke down uh tell us where you are now in the world and who
[1:16:53.760 --> 1:17:00.640]  you're with right alex jones great to be back with you yeah you know i tried to check in with you on
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:07.600]  our travels you know i checked in with you in athens in cairo in moscow now we're in amsterdam
[1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:18.160]  and i i met uh ansela who is um a really interesting um a voice for the alternative media and for some
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:25.200]  of the views that are not being picked up by the mainstream netherlands press the dutch press which
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:31.680]  is like many of these big countries that it's it's become very conservative and uh you when i travel
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:36.560]  and i know that you find the same thing when you travel you find pockets of resistance so i would
[1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:43.760]  say asela is is leading up a pocket of resistance he's also very involved in the dutch pirate party
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:51.120]  which is a very important political wave that's sweeping europe and in iceland if you've had
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:58.800]  brighita jones dot here on your show alex the mp from iceland who's championing the pirate party
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:04.160]  in iceland and the iceland pirate parties has many seats in parliament and they're in contention
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.600]  for running iceland so asela is a part of the pirate party here in the netherlands
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:15.200]  and um a couple stories i think we can kind of dig dig into the first story and i'll turn it over
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:23.200]  to asela but this idea of apple computer resisting the fbi is a is a fantastic story because the
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:28.800]  history of the netherlands alex if you go back to world war two when all the data was centralized
[1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:35.040]  by the government it was very easy when the nazis came to get that data from the government
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:39.200]  round up the jews and send them off to concentration camp sure that's like a gun registration is
[1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:44.320]  always used for confiscation exactly so i with this i'll kind of turn it over to asela for a
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:49.120]  moment to kind of speak a little bit about uh you know what what are your thoughts asela
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.920]  there's kind of a three-way conversation hi alex hey thanks for coming on with us thank you for
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:59.680]  having me what what's your thoughts on this apple news on the fbi and how's it playing here in
[1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:04.880]  action i mean the netherlands or has it fit in well obviously we also have apple products in
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:11.120]  the netherlands so i guess that affects us as well um yeah i i'm i'm really interested in
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:17.280]  in what what what apple has been doing in the past couple of uh i guess since tim cookess uh
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:23.360]  has arrived uh he's publicly said that he really values privacy and at first i was a little skeptical
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:28.000]  i was like yeah you're just saying that but now it's actually looking like they're starting to
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:36.320]  realize that their profit is in um trustworthy uh products not actual data they're taking the side
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:41.360]  of the of the user and you made an interesting point before the apple actually makes the products
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:46.560]  like the hardware whereas google and facebook are more service oriented yeah and they have a slightly
[1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:50.320]  different different uh business model what apple's really saying and i want both your takes on this
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:56.640]  is it ruins our platform to put backdoors in it that all the bad guys including government bad guys
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:01.760]  corporate bad guys individual bad guys it's like all these smart homes are getting constantly taken
[1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:07.280]  over and hacked they don't work it's crud you build backdoors and something it's not a house it's a
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:13.600]  cave yeah you can't you can't say well we're putting in a backdoor but only this type of person can
[1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:17.840]  come in only the government can come in no you're building backdoors and people are going to enter
[1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:22.240]  that backdoor obviously but actually here in the Netherlands there's tremendous value put on
[1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:29.680]  individual freedoms and a feeling of acceptance of different cultures and and and so having the
[1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:35.280]  government being accessed these technologies through the backdoor being spied on in this way
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:39.040]  you would think that the people here would be resistant but there is some tension right because
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:44.400]  the mainstream media it seems to be taking a different position well it's interesting that
[1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:49.360]  you should say that uh Holland is very liberal personal freedoms all that and i think we still
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:56.560]  live off of that reputation we've built up in the like 70s 80s maybe 90s um but that's rapidly
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:21:01.360]  gone down ever since we've had a christian government um nothing yes christians by the way
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:07.200]  alex but i don't understand there's more of an extreme puritanical deal uh that is coming in and
[1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:11.600]  trying to you know clean out the famous uh districts uh obviously there in amsterdam right
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:20.160]  the liberalism that we're famous for um um uh liberal drug laws and prostitution and all that
[1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:24.640]  they're really cracking down on that very hard as hard as they can but there's a very high profile
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:29.440]  political assassination just a few years ago uh good more than 10 years ago i think 10 more
[1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:36.080]  yeah there were two there were two murders um one of Pimpertang and one on Theo van Hof um and that
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:40.960]  has possibly instilled some that seemed to be a turning point some fear in the country sure well
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:47.040]  here's my problem with with radical islam or radical christian or anything that tries to impose
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:52.320]  things on people just like political correctness tries to impose worldviews language and behavior
[1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:57.840]  i'm a libertarian christian so i believe if you're not hurting somebody that's not my business i have
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:04.080]  i have my business to have my view on it but i want my basic freedoms and you know to me a lot of
[1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:09.200]  governments change the subject on the sex and things away from corruption away from government
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:12.960]  narcotics trafficking i mean it sounds to me like the netherlands wants to start laundering some of
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:16.560]  this drug money and wants it to be illegal again i mean they don't want to make drugs illegal to
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:20.080]  stop the drugs they want to make it be legal to bring more of it in and make a bigger profit
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:26.960]  that's your words not mine that's my view on it that's what i've seen them historically do
[1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:35.360]  there is you know we see this also alex in the america cracked down on swiss money laundering
[1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:41.840]  in swiss banks and all that money laundering is now in america so you're um when the government
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:46.560]  cracks down on some of these activities we find out that a lot of that corruption goes through
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:53.360]  local banks through money it increases the money laundering apian amro is a very dodgy bank here
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:58.240]  in the netherlands and during the 2008 crisis picking up money let's uh get into this idea because
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:04.320]  ensla is really her main topic well one of the one of the things about amsterdam is that we're a huge
[1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:13.440]  tax evasion haven for huge companies uh amongst which uh ukrainian oligarch oligarch millionaire
[1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:18.720]  billionaires or the famous irish dutch sandwich exactly i think it's called for example the band
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:24.080]  bono uh you two with bono they avoid taxation because their intellectual property runs through
[1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:29.520]  the netherlands yeah and then back to ireland exactly and if you have an office here it it's
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:35.760]  totally legit as long as you have a plant in your office this is not a joke like a friend of mine
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:42.000]  who's a very serious journalist has investigated this and the the tax laws are so that if you have
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.680]  an office here and even if you don't have any actual employees running around uh it's all
[1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:53.360]  it's totally legit as as long as you have a plant in your office when you say plant you don't mean
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:24:00.800]  a person as a plant but an actual like uh like a vex like a vex of a begonia or a carrot plant
[1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:06.400]  that's all it takes is an actual foliage exactly any type of living creature could you have like a
[1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:13.520]  little a cockroach or something too maybe in the plant but so on on these you really um really
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:17.600]  been focusing on this cash was this uh aspect because right here in the netherlands i'll just
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:22.800]  give you a look at the future almost nobody carries cash everyone uses the electronic cards and
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:27.600]  you're actually you're very much aware of this and you believe that this has negative consequences
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:32.560]  correct yeah absolutely i think the northern countries in europe including uh the netherlands
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:38.080]  even though we're not part of scandinavia um i think the scandinavian countries and holland
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:46.800]  are really pushing harsh against um uh for the outfacing of of cash money and your view why is
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:50.080]  that because i know in a lot of those northern european countries i mean they take money right
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:53.680]  out of your account whenever they want they don't even really have judges or juries in some of the
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:59.440]  cases they just do it automatically and now from the us to europe they're they're in concerted efforts
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:04.160]  saying it's time to face cash out i mean what are some of the problems in your view of doing that
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:11.600]  well we've seen uh something in cyprus happening where overnight they basically decided hey guys
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:17.920]  you're gonna turn in in some of your uh some of your savings and at the time uh diesel bloom said
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:24.080]  that that was a blueprint later he back paddled on those words uh saying that his english was not
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:29.440]  good enough which is kind of funny because one of his parents was an english teacher and he's gotten
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:35.440]  an award for clear language so it's funny that he should say that that's the blueprint for the rest
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:42.080]  of europe uh which since then he's taken back but um i i i noted it down as a little bit of a warning
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:48.480]  sign so apparently and uh they're going to eliminate the 500 euro bill well there there's talk of that
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:52.800]  they're they're pushing for the point that they're actually getting to that point you know first to
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:58.160]  get rid of the 10 000 a thousand a 500 larry summer says get rid of the 100 here in the us have you
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:02.240]  heard this that's not even that much money like a hundred dollars what does that get you that gets
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:07.200]  you like one week of groceries or something listen i'll go in a grocery store and i'll have a hundred
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:12.800]  bucks and i'll buy 75 dollars worth of stuff and act like i'm a crook i mean this is all
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:16.480]  part of this corporate culture and once they do that folks just like bank of america wants to
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:20.240]  charge you five dollars every time you use your debit card or your credit card just like they
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:24.240]  want to charge you ten dollars when you deposit your check then the government wants to make you
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:28.960]  take your social security check or federal check of your federal employee that way once they have
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.440]  you in a digital system they can track they can take the money away from you they can kill all
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:38.560]  underground economies this is total social control as you said earlier max and you know you're right
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:44.480]  there in europe uh ma'am what is your view on what the nazis would have done or the soviets would
[1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:49.120]  have done with these types of technologies and it's not like we're saying if we got a tyranny
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:53.520]  look at the nsa look at the eu spying we know they're already abusing this stuff
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:00.960]  well i don't like to draw comparisons in a to the past because it's such a sensitive topic here
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:07.040]  and as soon as you draw any of those comparisons people just they don't want to listen to your
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:11.520]  message what they don't want from the past boy that sounds like a recipe for disaster well let me
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:16.080]  jump in here for a second because it's such a hot button issue that it just shuts conversation down
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:19.920]  completely no understand they're arresting people all over europe that that that that that
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:25.120]  criticize the open borders i mean i see 10 stories a day of people arrested for their free speech i
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:29.040]  mean is that how bad is the chilling effect on speech in europe right now then that's a good question
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:36.800]  uh you have a lot of questions alex but i'll come back to the uh to the the outpacing of cash
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:42.400]  because in amsterdam it's actually now in a couple of areas it's gotten so bad in the northern part
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:47.680]  of amsterdam and in the western part of amsterdam um you can't they don't accept cash anywhere
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:53.760]  anymore and i've i've done a little bit of an investigation for my uh column in in the
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:59.120]  dutch financial times for that and it turns out that they actually have the banks have
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:07.760]  made a fund where they've put in millions of euros so that they can actively push for retailers to
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:17.760]  require their customers to uh to use cards so this is so it's it's got it's uh i think
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.280]  holland is one of the worst countries in the world right now together with probably
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:29.120]  norway danmark sweden um as far as uh being ahead in the game of uh of making their citizens
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:35.760]  just completely dependent on banking and plastic so for anybody max that's in denial about the
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:41.600]  global move to get rid of cash it's here you're the real expert on this what's the time frame do
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:47.200]  you think why are they racing to get it now well that's what i'm saying is that we see what the
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:51.520]  future we see here in the netherlands so the population they're not allowed to talk about the
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:58.000]  past even though you know stacy and i took a tour uh just a couple days ago from a world war two
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.360]  special tour and everywhere you go in the city there are brass plaques on the street and on the
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:08.880]  sidewalk where jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps and there are memorials all
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:14.720]  over the city for the time when hundred thousand or more people were rounded up sent to the death
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:20.000]  camps at the total complicity of the government essentially and with the cooperation of the
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.880]  government it became that as everyone knows the history quite a horrific time and yet you can't
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:30.960]  really speak about that at all it's a it's a total black hole in the memory and so when you try to
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:35.440]  make the comparison the obvious comparison to centralizing this data and what happens when
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:39.840]  you give it to the nazi germany stay there gotta go to break amazing info from the netherlands
[1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:50.320]  with max keiser and his lovely and informative guest we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:33.280]  about the black lives matter movement marquez ignored them which prompted calls and shouts that

[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:07.920]  that's not true look at the code this is highly suspicious on and on and on we didn't say they
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:13.280]  killed scalia we said is there foul play why are they saying no autopsy why are they doing it out
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:16.720]  of the gates i'm gonna ask max keiser and his guests about that too we're talking about free

[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.560]  such big events also i'm gonna ask him about this article out of bloomberg news newspapers
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:33.440]  wither in canada with no billionaires to save them that's right mainstream media collapsed
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:38.880]  really about 10 years ago but people like carlo slim bought the new york times and others all these
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:46.400]  cd fly-by-night individuals thinking it still had power and wanting it you know as a a a cliched
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:54.960]  badge of of power but they noticed it was worthless because uh they were buying discredited rags
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:02.080]  establishment mouthpieces blown out decades ago and so now they're dropping them like a dead
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:08.800]  rotting fish or an old shoe so they're dead but they're still walking dead i want to get max
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:12.080]  keiser and i'm not putting words in his mouth i know he agrees with that he said many times
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:16.080]  i want to get his view on when will they figure out they're dead it's like you wake up and you're
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:21.360]  dead like in an egger alan poe novel we're going back to them here in just a moment but before we

[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:45.600]  and you can see the results no that's not fda approved no that's unbelievable you know that's
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:50.880]  sweeping nether netherlands that until you can't you can't you can't it's an amazing development
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:55.440]  here but you know i'm just reading there's a breaking news from reuters the white house says
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:38:00.560]  the department of justice is not asking apple to create a new back door they're asking to access
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:06.000]  to one one device they're just asking to access this one device so the way that justice department
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.640]  is spinning this is we don't want you to change your entire policy toward protecting your consumers
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:16.160]  against the invasiveness of the government we just want to access one phone it sounds so freaking
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:21.920]  nasty like they come into town and they say we don't we just want one jew that's it the troublemaker
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:25.840]  down on that we just want to see one person's paper oh they already know how to break into them
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.840]  i've got people that can gel break pass codes it's well when they steal them from you they can
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:34.880]  break into them it's pure bull they're just dumbing it down let us have the code to the one terrorist
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:38.800]  which they mean apple give us back doors to everything give us back doors to your encryption
[1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:43.280]  slippery slope of tyranny now uh then the newspapers are an interesting question because
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:49.440]  in the case of jeff bees also of uh over there at amazon of course he bought a big newspaper in
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:54.960]  washington and as donald trump has pointed out it's already a money loser but he bought it because
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:59.920]  it is a money loser to offset his gains his capital gains because he hates paying taxes so he bought
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:05.760]  it as a loser as a money loser so that was a pure financial engineering trick and i would imagine
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:10.160]  that these other newspapers like the new york times are losing money and the new york times has
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:16.160]  got to be the most tragic example of a media gone horribly wrong uh going back to the bush
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:21.040]  administration where they failed to disclose before the bush election all of his complicity and
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.400]  major crimes uh and it's just gotten worse from there but in the media asla in the netherlands
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:32.160]  it's a media that is the more i've talked over the because you're a guest on my show we had a
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:38.480]  chance to talk there there just isn't any real diversity of media is there a diversity of media
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:44.160]  i get the impression that it's not very diverse here it's kind of lean asla that's a great question
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:51.520]  that's a great question well you have this uh false dichotomy of left right that's completely
[1:39:51.520 --> 1:40:00.080]  outdated but for some reason lots of people people in the media are frankly old i'm sorry um they're
[1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:06.640]  40 40 plus no no offense but um you know they're they're they're a little bit older and that's
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.360]  nothing wrong with that but they still seem to be living in the 80s 90s when there was this
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:19.760]  really clear left right dichotomy in in media and it takes paradigm and um and that's no longer
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:26.880]  in case whatsoever i'm with the pirate party and we're outspokenly not live left nor right um
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:30.880]  because we really truly don't feel that we fit into any of those old narratives
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:37.760]  uh we should start something called the renaissance party and just bring back the renaissance max
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:42.800]  what do you think yeah well um i think that what we try to do with all of our different
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:46.960]  networks is to cobble something together that is global and english-speaking that everyone
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:50.400]  can relate to here in the Netherlands everyone speaks english and you find this more and more
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:54.640]  around the world because of the internet because of facebook people are blogging in the international
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:59.200]  language of blogging which is english so you have i know you're very well known all over the world
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:04.320]  remember i go people talk about your show so if people like Ansela here in the Netherlands or
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:09.520]  other countries they can plug into that that alternative voice that everyone is kind of
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:14.560]  speaking on we do have a chance to create some something powerful but when i look about this
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:19.680]  this the question i have is here in america you've got bernie sanders and donald trump
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:25.840]  but they they both speak in ways bernie sanders obviously from a socialist perspective where you
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:32.880]  are asked to rely on the government as being kind of a nanny state and then donald trump
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:40.160]  is asking you to trust him as a benign dictator in more or less than a white horse just truck man
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:46.560]  the white horse but both of those are in my view not american in the sense that they're democratic
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:54.240]  so my question is um do you when you observe american politics do you see american politics
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:01.520]  falling into this trap of giving all the power of the people over to a charismatic ideologue
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:05.840]  whether yeah and either you're either left wing or you're right wing you're either blue or red or
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:12.480]  either uh democrat or republican there's only two two of these types that you can be and if you're
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:17.200]  one you're against the other and if you're the other you're against the one and i think that's a
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:22.960]  very very harmful unnuanced way of looking at things so they're constantly setting up divided
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:27.520]  hunger oh absolutely and so let me ask you this question specifically though because i know in
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:32.400]  some pockets of europe uh that that it is still kind of the old establishment media you got a lot
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:37.040]  of alternative media but it kind of feeds into the mainstream media but i look at the united
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:42.480]  states and some other areas uh mainstream media is pretty much dying alternative media is now
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:46.480]  bigger than it in the aggregate much bigger than that and they have different studies and breakdowns
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.880]  years ago uh showing that i mean look at drudge report it's more traffic than the new york times
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.720]  in facebook you know combined and it's about the dwarf uh you know just cnn as well and everything
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:01.840]  it does and that's just one website uh when info wars i'm not bragging it's just a fact it's an
[1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:07.280]  indicator is exponentially growing i agree that that's what a bernie sanders rise or a donald
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:12.400]  trump's rise shows that people really are going for anything but what they see as establishment
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:19.760]  but but where do you see that landscape going uh in europe if you aren't as diverse as we are yet
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:24.640]  or is that a oversimplification because it goes back to earlier question what's going to happen
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:31.120]  here in the west as the newspapers die and they're dying not from competition but from the fact that
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:37.680]  they shovel so much government disinformation at people and are not trusted uh i often get the
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:44.800]  question well you say you have a lot of criticism on this newspaper and on that news news media platform
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:52.480]  um who do you trust what do you look towards to for your information and my answer is always
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:44:00.880]  i don't trust media platforms i trust individual journalists um exactly i think i think people
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:06.160]  have to look towards individuals who are really making the difference who are really doing
[1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:13.200]  truth-worthy reporting who are really being true to to the truth and to themselves and i think it's
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:19.680]  easy once you start to look for that trait to distinguish one from the other well i know in
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:26.080]  the journalistic space where where i am there's uh we come up against what's called access journalism
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:32.800]  so in other words for me to interview let's say larry summers or or greenspan you got to do exactly
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.600]  what they say look at the new hillary stuff where hundreds of newspapers agree to write exactly what
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:43.120]  she says in their article and then put their name on it or she won't give them access right so
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:48.960]  the criticism of my journalism might be well you never interview anybody uh let's say larry
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:55.200]  summers caliber government official uh and they they would characterize that as as being somehow
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:45:01.760]  a less journalistic integrity but without mentioning the fact that the access journalism model
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:06.400]  is that if in fact you interview these people they give you the script and you have to ask the
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:11.040]  question that's right we have to ambush these people to get them to talk to us they won't talk
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:16.240]  to us because they run from us like the plague right so yeah that's that that's what you end up
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:20.480]  with you end up with people that are actually just an ambush folks in the corridor and then
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:25.280]  but the the average viewer and to answer this point about the demographics i mean here the
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:30.320]  demographics is getting older so the mainstream media caters to an older established uh group
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:34.160]  of folks that are well off you know they've written the post world war two boom they don't
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:38.320]  want anything upsetting the apple cart they're getting a nice pension and why question that in
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:43.040]  america i think you're really on point by the way for a foreigner you're like exactly on point
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:48.080]  that's exactly who's going on in the Netherlands right now well it's in america too with fox news
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:53.600]  the the demographic for fox news is 65 years and older uh this these are people that are again this
[1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:59.280]  is the baby boomers who are happy with everything that came with being a baby boomer the fact that
[1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:04.000]  this new millennial generation is in debt for student debt car loan debt they can't get a job
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:09.440]  they can't it's not their concern so it leaves them open then for a demagogue to come along and
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:13.920]  pick them up so we're seeing i think history repeating itself in many ways in that the older
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:18.400]  generation is too lazy to lift a finger to stop this even though they're got they know what they
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:23.120]  see what's really happening and the new generation is clueless and they're going to be led by the
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:28.560]  nose by but that gets back to the data question because if all the data is centralized like they
[1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:34.480]  had in the netherlands during world war two well when the occupying force showed up in the form of
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:40.560]  the nazi party in germany they the mayor of netherlands there's a picture of him handing the book
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:46.560]  over to the nazi official with an outline on the chart on the map or where the jews live and there's
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:51.840]  a famous picture of this you see him just handing the information so tim cook is right because we
[1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:56.880]  don't want to centralize his data because we don't know who's going to be running the country next
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:02.560]  year or the year after that but also ibm helped run the computers for all of that across europe
[1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:07.600]  on record and you tell the average american that they don't even know that and then now ibm runs
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:12.800]  the death panel computers to decide what troops to not give health care to and they're not just
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:19.040]  triaging people in a battle i mean they're deciding not to give people health care according to their
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:24.720]  politics max so we're already having electronic ghettos that you warned of 15 years ago are we
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:30.400]  not already entering the electronic uh gulag casino model right i mean you already you mentioned
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:36.960]  people saying well you know nazism is dead fascism is dead well the corporations that supported
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:42.800]  hitler's nazism are not dead ibm was a company that supplied the tattooed serial numbers for
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:48.320]  the concentration camp victims those are ibm supplied for all those famous tattooed numbers
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.680]  on the computer it went in the ibm computer yeah right and then you had coca cola created a
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:48:00.080]  drink for the nazis called fanta it was an arms drink wall Disney huge nazi supporter for Henry
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  Ford nazi supporter those companies are still here they don't notice now at jp morgan and to the mix
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:11.280]  and the other big bankers both wagon was actually designed by hitler he drew the famous vw that is
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:16.560]  his design and look i don't want to say nazis run everything the point is is that these corporations
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:21.040]  are so ruthless like curl quickly wrote and tragedy and hope they will work with any totalitarian
[1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:26.400]  socialist fascists they don't care they want centralized control so so so how do you see this
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:30.320]  huge populist awakening across the world you see it in europe as well with the numbers and i've
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:35.600]  just been to europe several times lately integrating in and colliding with an establishment that's
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:40.960]  concentrated power and as tools of oppression the world's never seen uh let me uh ask uh
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:47.680]  both of you that question well i think that's why you're seeing the rise of uh you're uh
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:52.880]  an all across europe and all across the world political parties such as uh the pirate party
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:59.120]  that is why we're all seeing this trend and we're all going what the hell is going on and what are
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:04.960]  we going what are the fundamental problems that are on the basis of of everything that we're seeing
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.160]  that's wrong with the world right now um right to pick up to pick up on the pirate party it was
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:15.600]  started in sweden by a guy named rick foc vina who uh you may have had him on your shelf a few years
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:20.000]  ago i he spent on my shelf a few times but it's directly addressing copyright and copyright
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:28.880]  law that um the need for these large corporations in the copyright space to claim copyright on
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:36.000]  and patents uh in a pervasive way for perpetuity is a form of uh ghettoization of intellectual
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:41.600]  property so that anytime you want to access our birthright as humans to the intellectual domain
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:47.360]  from ideas from a hundred years ago 200 years ago uh you won't have access to these ideas even
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:52.080]  going back throughout history because they're owned by corporations and so it's in effect a
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:57.520]  group lobotomy that's right and once it's all digital they can shut that down i want to come
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:01.760]  back and talk about that i want to go five minutes the next hour because i got you guys on a bit
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:05.920]  late and i have the former head of psychological warfare one of the founders of delta force
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:12.640]  dr steve pacenek joining us on the scalia situation uh but uh ansula i got to ask you the question
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:17.200]  are are you really scarlett joe hanson because i got to be honest i don't usually get a lovely
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:20.080]  lady on just because they're lovely i'm getting you on because you're a great journalist or written
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:22.800]  some interesting things but i got to tell you i've been sitting there marveling because you
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:27.040]  are an interesting looking woman you look like a cross between scarlett joe hanson and tracy lords
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:30.480]  but i'm looking at even closer i think you may look more like my like a scarlett joe hanson
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:34.720]  i think one of the prettiest women alive so i got to say max keiser is a very very lucky man to
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:39.680]  be in your presence there i'll actually just give kudos to your to your loveliness but uh i think
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:44.240]  after you're on this show hollywood's going to be calling because they need a body double for scarlett
[1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:49.520]  joe hanson imagine that film we're going to come right back under the skin with real guys in northern
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:55.200]  scotland getting picked up by scarlett joe hanson is really a alien oh my gosh i think i'd actually
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:00.240]  still get in the car even though it wasn't alien stay with us my dad was 59 when he collapsed from

[1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:19.280]  it shows on bbcljzeromaxkeiser.com i'm alex jones your host we got them for five six more minutes
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:24.240]  and then we've got him for another little segment and then i've got the former black ops psychological
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:28.240]  warfare head of the state department co-author of many of clancy's books joining us to get his
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:34.720]  take on scalia the economy and more but first here's a clip of scalia uh just last year saying
[1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:39.760]  what can obama do to me he can't stop me if i block his gun grabs his open borders all of it
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:45.360]  well none of you end up sleeping with the fishes here we go what can he do to me
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:53.840]  or to any of us we have life tenured and we have it precisely so that we will not be influenced by
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:55:01.600]  by politics by threats from from anybody what the hell is this that's a silly message
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:07.760]  i mean it's local brassie sleeps with the fishes so there you go let me ask both of you your take
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:14.880]  going to our guest first uh enslo what do you think of the whole thing i mean should we question
[1:55:14.880 --> 1:55:20.000]  why there's no autopsy and why they instantly say no foul play when they first announce it i mean
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:26.320]  none of your laws are somewhat similar over in europe about autopsies what do you think um well
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:31.120]  unfortunately i have to say that this topic has not been covered a whole lot in the netherlands
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:37.040]  and uh therefore um i have not much to say about it well i think that's fair if you're not informed
[1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:41.760]  on it i mean he's he's as important as the president basically right now with this deadlock
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:46.800]  court and i'm very interested in hearing your side of the story and and hearing what's going on
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:51.440]  max then i mean max if obama died and there wasn't an autopsy would people be concerned
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:56.480]  well yeah well a couple points first of all this isn't getting any coverage in
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:02.720]  in the press here as far as i can i can tell so it's not really a big topic here and uh the second
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:09.760]  of all um this um this is the next this has the potential to rip open the supreme court in a huge
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:16.160]  way right on the eve of a major decision coming down on uh abortion rights in the us so this is
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:21.840]  going to really put the good boss on things but it's such a sensitive topic i would think that
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:29.600]  they would do everything that they could to diminish the hysteria that's now going to ensue but to
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:37.120]  not perform this seems like it's irresponsible the idea of the pillow on the face you know this is
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.680]  information that could have been completely left out of the report it seems like it just added on as
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:46.960]  an anecdote like oh by the way he had a pillow on his face oh and by the way he wrote a note that
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:51.920]  said help me help me it just seems like exactly okay so you're you're you're on target so what
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:56.720]  is the siobh then because it is scripted to make us think he was killed i mean you couldn't write
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:04.240]  an attic of a christy novel like this i think it's very careless on these folks and um to allow
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:10.000]  this to happen i also what strikes me is quite of unusual is that these guys do carry a lot of
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:15.760]  secret service or some kind of protection around them and apparently there was a huge lapse of any
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:20.640]  kind of uh of secret service i don't know exactly what the protocol is with supreme court justices
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:27.840]  but it seems like it was it just seems really sloppy uh all the way around and unfortunately
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:33.520]  this is opening up uh an enormous can of worms because heading into an electric cycle you've
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:38.400]  got enormous content contentiousness on both sides of the aisle and all these topics are coming up for
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:46.000]  a vote and um you know i just think that this has potential to really um cause tremendous uh i don't
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:52.160]  know if it's a constitutional crisis per se but if obama is shut down from from completely functioning
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:58:00.320]  as the chief executive it could get really gnarly well he's talking about just heard so far is that
[1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:06.720]  he's a right-wing nuts and therefore it doesn't really matter yeah he's dehumanized uh a lot of
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:11.920]  so-called left said he deserved to die and they hope clarence thomas died conservative press in the
[1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:19.920]  netherland very interesting point of view right that this guy was a right-wing nut and and and so
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:26.640]  good riddance okay that that that would be a typical right that's the kind of the the the the the
[1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:30.880]  thought you're in a very conservative country i won't say that sums it up that that's what people
[1:58:30.880 --> 1:58:35.280]  are that well that's what people are saying now now now is that is that is that scarlott jill hanson's
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:38.960]  opinion or is he saying that's the opinion of the folks in the netherlands i'm joking folks we'll be

[2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:14.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the front lines of the information
[2:00:14.800 --> 2:00:22.880]  war it's alex jones and philophilia is our guest with max keiser of course of max keiser dot
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:27.600]  com final segment of these folks then we're getting back into scalia what the russians are
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:33.680]  saying it costs world war three and more coming up with the invasion and expansion of the proxy
[2:00:33.680 --> 2:00:41.280]  war in syria and ukraine so that is all coming up let me ask both of you because you're you're
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:46.160]  both in europe i consider the uk to be right there in europe you know 70 miles across the
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:55.200]  english channel there but trying to understand this to both of you uh both to ansula and also to max
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:01:00.800]  for you it's a little closer to home war with russia open discussions but yet you have saying this
[2:01:00.800 --> 2:01:06.080]  is escalating into world war three a lot of mainline analysts saying that what what is your view on
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:13.760]  the prospect of larger wars in europe well right now i feel like we're really being torn between
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:20.640]  the united states and russia um and we're kind of caught in the middle between all these uh huge
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:28.240]  entities who are like having a tug of war going on and uh and we're cut cut in between cut in the
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:34.640]  middle and uh caught in the middle and um and the information is not very clear on that which is why
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:40.480]  with the pirate party we've started a platform to collect all the information that is available
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:47.760]  uh it's called dutchvote.eu if you don't mind me plugging that oh plug everything plug plug
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:51.440]  the promotion of free speech yeah yeah tell me about the ways that you're trying to defend free
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:02:00.320]  speech uh yeah so there's a lot of bias reporting uh going on in media on both sides uh so what we're
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:07.760]  trying to do with the pirate party is um provide a platform we're actually working on and for now
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:15.760]  it's dutch but we're working on an english language platform uh on dutchvote.eu and what's exciting is
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.160]  max talked about pirate party years ago uh just like uke you could say is more right wing or whatever
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:25.680]  the point is it's spreading as a populace vehicle and so the it's it's exciting to see the pirate
[2:02:25.680 --> 2:02:32.400]  party growing as well yeah we're very much for a democracy an informed democracy which is kind of
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:38.560]  an important point uh for an informed democracy right now we're not being informed and we're not
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:46.880]  getting a democratic democratic vote uh voice uh so we're really pushing for both those points uh
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:55.040]  information and democracy and what's the website again dutchvote.eu dutchvote.eu i want you both
[2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:58.960]  to have a final comment the two months we have left but max i'm going to be on your show which is
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:02.720]  global reaches literally hundreds of millions of people that's on all over the world on the main
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:06.960]  rt uh and i know you plan to have gone about a week and a half who knows what the topic will be then
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:10.480]  but what are you thinking we're going to be discussing what are you mainly focusing on right
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:15.440]  now what are other big hot button issues well leading up to these elections now you you and your
[2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:19.680]  crew are doing an excellent job covering all the stories and so you're i think we're going to be
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.600]  picking your brain about what's happening and of course you had Donald Trump on your show
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:29.440]  remarkably uh the mainstream has really turned to your show to because they understand that you're
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:33.760]  talking directly to people in an unfiltered way i mean when i come on your show but on your show
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:39.680]  for years you've i've never been asked to filter any in any way at all it's completely unscripted
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:44.880]  uncensored just raw and people that's what people want now that's what they need they're tired of
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:50.880]  the posing in the mainstream uh you know the the the actors that that that appear but just on this
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:56.960]  point about what's happening here with the with the the Netherlands is also there's a referendum
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:04.160]  coming up about supporting the EU inclusion of Ukraine into the EU and the mainstream media is
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:10.720]  trying to get the Dutch people to accept the Ukraine into EU without telling them that they're
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:16.560]  stepping into a proxy war between America and Russia and being signed on to the EU's debt
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:23.120]  and yeah and all everything that comes with the EU which is a sinking whole of debt and
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:29.200]  depravity uh there but the mainstream media here is like la la we have to exactly answer a real
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:32.560]  quick 30 second answer do you think the EU is going to stay together or do you think it's
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:39.360]  going to break up and come and turn into something different from here no bird do you think the EU
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:48.880]  will survive um you know i'm afraid it will well we would definitely want to have you both back on

[2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:08.160]  starts off on the face of scalia and then moves to above his head exclusive just a scalia was not
[2:05:08.160 --> 2:05:13.920]  found with a pillow over his face it was above his head reveal sheriff who was first on the scene
[2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:18.560]  when he wasn't it took him 30 minutes to get there after he received the call prosidio county
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:23.440]  sheriff danie dominguez told daily mail that the pillow was in fact above his head and there was
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:28.720]  nothing fishy about his death now let's look back at what john poindexter cibolo creek ranch owner
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:33.840]  said to my san Antonio when he found scalia we discovered the judge in bed a pillow over his
[2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:38.880]  head said poindexter do you believe the man who entered the room first saw the body first and then
[2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:43.440]  contacted the authorities first or do we believe the sheriff who arrived 30 minutes after he received
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:47.760]  a phone call and now has had two or three days to think about what he has to say this latest article

[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:57.680]  worldwide i really appreciate dr steve machinic coming on on short notice he's an md phd an american
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:09:02.240]  psychiatrist former state department official author and publisher co-wrote a whole bunch of
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:07.840]  tom clancy's books as the jack ryan characters a composite based a lot on him trained in psychiatry
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:12.880]  harvard university and international relations at mit his novels are based on over 20 years experience
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:18.640]  resolving international crisis hostage situations for the state department steve machinic dot com
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:25.040]  he was the head of their psychological warfare uh operations as well one of the guys that uh with
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:30.880]  the top generals helped start the delta force and morb and he has been involved in overthrowing
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:36.000]  governments on record actually quarterbacking those operations so he's a smart guy to be able to
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:40.640]  really give us in-depth humance but also he's been in the council on foreign relations and
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:46.640]  and resigned from it after 9 11 because of what he wrote down to be a false flag it's genius that
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:50.640]  donald trump obviously has come out and saying hey you want to attack me you want to play games
[2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:54.640]  you want to say i i hurt women bill clinton's a rapist hey you want to play games on national
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:09:59.040]  security you're not a hero bush you let 9 11 happen and i have to know trump's ready to go
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:03.600]  further trump is a listener i'm just gonna leave it at that that's why they don't even attack trump
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:09.840]  for coming on the show because they didn't fall into his trap they almost did so uh if trump
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:15.040]  isn't a good guy he is one of the most sneaky high-power manipulators i've ever seen uh to
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:21.280]  actually come out takeover be a head in the race in a dead heat with hillary it's just amazing
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:24.880]  this country's in the middle of revolution and the tyrants are trying to come in with their
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:28.960]  own revolution to block it this just happened as you know in the last hour terror attack in
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:36.400]  turkish capital targets military personnel and an explosion targeting turkish military uh buses
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:42.800]  carrying personnel killed at least 18 145 others in the capital and it's now it's already wednesday
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:46.960]  over there and what government officials called an act of terror the u.s. embassy activated ducking
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:53.040]  cover following a nearby explosion a u.s. government source told fox news so all hell is breaking loose
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:58.320]  and and dr pacenic can speak to that strategy of tension and who he thinks may be behind this but
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:05.520]  you've got the saudis rolling in saying get ready for ground war against the russians uh in syria
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:11.360]  you've got me idea of last week saying this could lead to a large new world war uh you've got top
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:17.280]  us generals on fox calling for war with russia retired generals this is really a wild time
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:22.800]  and the reason we have dr pacenic here out of the gates and i hope he'll cover this first i don't
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:28.800]  know his view yet his website steve pacenic dot com obviously find his non-fiction and fiction books
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:35.040]  there but i don't know his view on this yet you look at what happened with skelly um you look at
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:40.240]  how they wrote a script here with a pillow on his head but don't worry no foul play and we're not
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:45.280]  going to have an autopsy written to make people think something happened i was the first to question
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:50.080]  it now they've had all these top police detectives the head of the detectives operation in you know
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:56.880]  new york dc all these top forensics people are on cbs news going no this stinks to high
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:02.960]  heaven the defaults in autopsy i know dr pacenic's been involved in autopsy he understands law uh
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:08.480]  and of course he's also been a covert operations commander in combat as well in secret operations
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:13.040]  so he can speak to this on every angle so if he disagrees with me that i think there's some
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:18.800]  hanky panky that's fine because i really respect his opinion uh i don't know it yet dr pacenic
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:24.000]  thank you what do you really think's going on here well alex it's a pleasure to be on the audience
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:32.800]  on your show again honestly uh i think skelly is death has more relevant to what you and your
[2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:39.360]  great audience and trump has been doing to then the actual death of skelly and let me explain it
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:47.840]  we have had since you and i have had a 14 or 15 year relationship we have been attacked not only
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:57.520]  you but i repeatedly as truthers conspiracy uh that is the way the establishment and as you call it
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:05.840]  the uh decaying media has been putting us in the corner what we're dealing with is far greater than
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:12.480]  skelly you hit it right on the head now whether he was killed or was not killed is as relevant to
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:20.160]  the following issue we no longer we the american people no longer trust obama no longer trust
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:27.040]  the bushes no longer trust the clinton that's a statement of fact the statement of revolution
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:34.000]  has been that we have not allowed ourselves to be count by individuals or by groups in your case
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:39.200]  you've remained on the air and i've been very proud of you and i've been very proud of the audience
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:46.320]  in my case they try to shut me up with subpoenas and other operations that i understood and
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:52.960]  were able to avert the real issue at hand it's glia may be the flash point but we are now
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:58.480]  entering the heat of battle and the battle basically is a revolutionary battle where
[2:13:59.040 --> 2:14:05.440]  trump correctly is saying the things that you have said the audience has said and we have talked
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:13.680]  about every time trump talks about 9 11 it's a coded message to warn the bushes that you are on trial
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:19.360]  it's not simply that i happen to know as trump says the people who own the building but i happen to
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:26.400]  know who did it as well trump is exceedingly bright he's exceedingly incisive i could not
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:31.760]  have predicted five years ago even a year ago that trump would have come to the forefront
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:38.240]  but thanks to roger stone to cori lentowski and others from the tea party and other parties
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:44.240]  they've come forward and picked the right man who was not beholden to anybody so what are we
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:50.160]  really talking about when scaly is dead the attention focuses to the clinton's correctly why
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:56.960]  because hillary clinton has the history of lying distortion killing and assassination as does bill
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:03.840]  despite the fact that both of them are cowardly both of them are inept and i happen to know for
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:10.560]  fact and they have a lovely daughter the truth of the matter is michael flinn the former director
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:17.360]  general uh the former lieutenant general intelligence agency agency stated very clearly
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:23.040]  to hillary clinton on fox network and everywhere else and i wrote a blog michael flinn who's the
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:31.040]  extremely highly regarded intelligence operative under a macrystal said repeatedly hillary clinton
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:37.760]  should stop the campaign she has violated the and he said we were ordered to create create isis and
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:44.160]  give them power to take over syria he said that arousal zero and on fox which to me signaled a
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:50.880]  rebellion within the military a soft valkyrie and and so this is all about pushing a referendum of
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:56.400]  we don't trust you you're illegitimate we don't buy anything you're selling even if you say that
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:01.520]  them you know that the moon is made out of rock we don't believe it because you said it correct
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:07.680]  alec so let me put it in another way we've said it for a long time and sometimes you had to quiet
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:14.000]  me down but for years i've said we've had a military a military that went to war in combat
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:19.680]  rightfully wrongfully who's come back and said enough is enough and we will perform what is
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:25.360]  called the soft coup we saw it with demsey a couple of months ago when i i spoke on your show and
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:31.200]  when demsey basically said i can't trust my own generals i don't trust the white house which he's
[2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:36.960]  correct because well you know hold on you and colonel shaver and others said two plus years ago that
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:42.000]  that he had gone to the white house and said the military is not backing you openly bombing syria
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:47.920]  no we're going to help the russians that was a soft coup right there that came out as you know
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:55.360]  was sy harsh and is now confirmed that is sensationally good news exactly now on top of that for
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:17:02.880]  for me to tell you that michael flinn defense intelligence aid i can't tell you a more in
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:10.800]  my world more important than scalia is michael flinn why because he and james clapper and i
[2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:15.440]  can't invoke clapper but clapper's a good man who's director of national intelligence
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:22.160]  but both of them really oversee 15 of our intelligence units in the military not only
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:28.480]  civilian but in the military and he has warned her and he has basically informed the american public
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:36.240]  to resist in the best way possible which is to deny the election to the bushes deny the election
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:42.000]  to the clinton's and deny them to anyone else except for the man who can speak the loudest and
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:49.520]  can say what he has to say whether trump knows the details of four structures or conventional
[2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:54.160]  systems or he knows the intelligence it's not as relevant to me and here's the big news i want to
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:18:00.720]  give people you knew what was going on correct the day after i had stoned on you basically on air
[2:18:00.720 --> 2:18:05.040]  repeated the conversation i had with him in there and you hadn't even talked to him you just know
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:11.040]  who he is and they basically telegraphed to me that hey trump's on board he knows what's going on
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:17.680]  we're going to shut him up on your show if they go after him for 911 truth but they were smart
[2:18:17.680 --> 2:18:23.600]  enough to not do it so it shows that there are large cadres in the government that have actually
[2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:30.400]  recruited trump and that trump had to spend weeks thinking about it a year ago plus and literally
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:34.320]  thinking about how he might have to face his death so which whatever you want to say about trump
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:41.760]  he is making a run at him and they they are really concerned let me this is it and without being an
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:48.400]  exaggeration this is the equivalent of the new american revolution you and i've waited for 14
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:56.640]  years since 911 what trump did on the past weekend and attacked george bush jr was right on the mark
[2:18:56.640 --> 2:19:02.240]  scared the hell out of it very clearly they're scared they're scared and what you're seeing now
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:08.160]  is the desperation of what happened in the french revolution the kings and queens their heads are
[2:19:08.160 --> 2:19:14.400]  be i'm going to be cut off and hillary her head is going to be cut off in the case of bush jr
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:20.560]  his head is going to be cut off that's metaphorically speaking as long as the american public thrust
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:25.840]  forward and keeps up that momentum basically what they're saying is that the republican
[2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:31.360]  establishment is finished which it is because i can't believe mccain and a whole bunch of those
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:37.280]  old farts really represent anything other than their own vested interest and when you see uh
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:44.000]  what's her name uh the graham lindsay miss lindsay talking even though he's been in combat he's been
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:49.040]  in the military democratic he's not relevant and what trump is doing stay there we got to go to

[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:41.360]  citizen sees the quote federal government is the number one threat and now they have

[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:11.120]  really important breaking world news and and information but I'm not bragging when I do a
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:17.600]  Facebook mentions Saturday night at eight o'clock at night and just say watch them not do an autopsy
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:21.520]  watch them do this and that from the way they announced it it looks suspicious this isn't
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:27.440]  standard they're ignoring all the defaults and then now there's 19,000 articles today with my name
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:32.240]  in it worldwide attacking me but but police and everybody are coming out and Michael Sabbath
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:36.640]  is coming out and and and Donald Trump's coming out and saying no it does look suspicious and the
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:41.840]  more they change their story the worse it looks that's a referendum on how discredited they are
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:48.480]  but listen I don't enjoy the power trip of being the guy willing to do this I want to see him defeated
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:54.160]  I want to see more people jump in first ahead of me because it is dangerous and I'm willing to die
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:26:00.720]  but I'll tell you this I don't I don't tempt the fates I don't flirt with it I'm not macho I'm not
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:06.000]  looking for it I have a duty and I'm going to do it but I tell you this folks now every week
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.720]  we're changing the narrative and hurting them and it's making them mad we've interviewed Hillary
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:15.520]  and a run into her and Jeb and everybody I know I'm ranting Dr. Botanic I'm kind of asking you as a
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:21.680]  you know really smart mentor from the inside what you think I could feel in my gut the danger
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:26.480]  and the creepiness that when they see info wars now as a reporter they get an adrenaline rush they
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:32.560]  stand up like a cat getting electrocuted and their people all freak out with fear when they hear my
[2:26:32.560 --> 2:26:38.000]  name or see our flag on a microphone so I know these are dangerous killers these are mafia
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:45.600]  dons and I it doesn't scare me but it's bracing and nauseating to see them react in fear of my name
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:52.640]  or my symbols what do you say to that sir well I think it's a tribute to you and your millions of
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:58.880]  people in the audience around the world to know that we all believe in an alternative narrative
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:06.480]  which is not given by the standard media or the presidency basically what you're involved in now
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:12.000]  and I say it in terms of the intelligence operative that I was or am you're involved in agitation
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:19.040]  propaganda what we're doing now on your part and what you have done effectively is to basically
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:25.600]  agitate the entire structure of not one administration but three administrations
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:32.480]  spanning over 30 years at the same time because of your vocal opinion and I'm not talking and you
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:40.160]  know to flaunt you or lodge you but you have done a remarkable job of taking the information that we
[2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:46.400]  now know on the internet and the people who are long who come along with us the military men who
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:51.520]  fought in Iraq and Afghanistan who understood that the biggest lie that was given to them but was
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:58.640]  by a coward who avoided the draft named George W. Bush Jr. and another coward who avoided the draft
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:06.080]  11 times named Cheney all of whom can pronounce big words and send everyone to war except themselves
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:13.600]  or their brothers either Neil Marvin, Jeb or George all cowards not maybe cowards but cowards
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:18.400]  outright cowards and disgusting individuals and it's one thing if they dodge the draft but then
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:24.240]  to be war mongers on top of it later that's the way to cover up the fact that they're cowards so
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:30.480]  those who send us to war never been to war we will have to deny and this is where the Iraqi
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:36.000]  and Afghanistan veterans the brave warriors who went forth for men and women to stand up and say
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:41.360]  we've had enough you want to go to war mr. Cruz you go to Canada and join up and go with the
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:46.880]  military you want to go to war mr. Rubio you've never been to war but you've certainly been your
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:53.440]  brother-in-law certainly been in the cocaine wars in Miami so what's happening is a lot of the issues
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:29:00.320]  of truth are coming forth will they assassinate you no I can guarantee you that and the reason's
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:06.960]  very simple whoever they is is number one not interested in assassinating you or anybody
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:13.520]  else and number two there is an inability within the structure to have assassinations committed
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:19.280]  without outsourcing let me be very clear the people who usually did the dirty work in the
[2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:26.400]  JFK assassination came out of Texas I don't want to go into their names but many other presidents
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:34.080]  were involved senior bush nixon and others were involved in the assassination of Kennedy he should

[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:17.920]  nominee hopeful one of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps and it was all downhill
[2:30:17.920 --> 2:30:22.080]  from there hoff writes penniless he went on unemployment desperately he tried carpentry but
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:26.720]  can barely sink a nail he was a blank carpenter a friend told political magazine then he tried
[2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:32.160]  his hand at freelancing for leftist rags writing about masturbation and rape for $50 a story they
[2:30:32.160 --> 2:30:36.880]  did say the only thing he was good at was talking non-stop about socialism and how the rich were
[2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:41.840]  ripping everybody off so he tried politics starting his own socialist party four times he ran and
[2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:47.040]  lost badly for vermont public office finally he warmed his way into the senate in 2006 the choice
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:51.920]  of this election is shaping up to be a very clear one it is really a war between capitalism and

[2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:27.520]  here rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones steve machanics are
[2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:32.080]  gassed and i appreciate him coming on about these khalia situation and i just love his answer
[2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:36.640]  because he just crystallized it all in one minute what i've been babbling about for four days and
[2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:42.080]  that is it doesn't matter whether they killed him or not no one believes anything they say
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:46.880]  they've got polls out there where over 80 percent of americans don't believe it almost all the
[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:53.840]  comments don't believe it and their response in the news is just to make stuff up and say that i said
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:33:59.920]  obama strangled him and then and killed lennard neemoy i said we should investigate this there
[2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:05.200]  should be an autopsy and i don't want to make it about myself but i want to understand this because
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:11.520]  i'm just a guy and again what i've done as a model obviously when dr machinics done as a model
[2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:17.040]  and i'm trying to understand this myself because it's so surreal and dr machinic was on just a
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:23.760]  month ago saying basically the liberty movement which you became a spokesman of is like rock and
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:30.480]  roll it's like a new cultural wave that can't be stopped and i'm just part of the branding
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:36.880]  organically of people not buying into the system anymore so i'm just one figurehead but but and
[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:42.240]  that's great because believe me i don't like messing with all these dangerous people all day i mean
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:47.680]  i'll do what i have to do but i really want to just see america made great again i want to reverse
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:52.240]  this downward slide i don't think there's going to be some type of utopia coming but whenever i've
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:59.040]  been around recently retired generals or former special forces kernels or current uh delta force
[2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:03.200]  people you name it some of them have been here in studio others you know have been on the show
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:08.880]  they'll actually ask me hey really what intelligence agency are you with what class are you you know do
[2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:12.000]  you get sheep dipped out of high school because a lot of people get recruited out of high school in
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:16.640]  these agencies i'm like no i've never been part of any agency any group nothing two years at community
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:21.920]  college i was about to go to ut for rtf they were teaching 10-year-old information i went into an
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:27.120]  access show got a local radio show got into radio sales i'm nothing half the time it's
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:34.080]  unlistable it's that nobody else was organic and did this and i'm just sick of like state
[2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:39.520]  high level state people come over to my table in downtown austria and ask me what agency i'm with
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:45.120]  police chiefs think i'm in some secret agency military people think i'm some secret guy uh
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:50.240]  and all and i'm just an organic american and a texan that has been defending the bill of rights
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:54.720]  and constitution and it's like people can't believe there'd be someone that could be successful as
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:35:59.120]  if you've got to be in some like you know they hand all these old intelligence agency names and all
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:03.200]  this stuff it's like machanic says he's back in the old days of humet well they were actually out
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:10.000]  there doing stuff now it's just endless agencies and titles and you know guys speaking in their
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:14.800]  armed things with you know glasses pulling up trying to intimidate me i just laughed at them
[2:36:15.920 --> 2:36:21.360]  i just it's like they've gone from being real men to pretending to be real men and then the real
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:26.000]  men in the military and everywhere else see that they're a joke and it's just it's just a disaster
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:30.800]  but i don't mean to rant sir i want to get into russia and uh the saudi arabia situation the election
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:37.120]  where you think is going and the time we have left but how do i respond to these other government
[2:36:37.120 --> 2:36:41.760]  people thinking i must be part of some branch of a government and then at another level i do have
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:47.360]  branches of different agencies actually trying to couple with what we're doing to resist the
[2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:52.560]  globalist and all and i'm not working with some agency you know in an official capacity i don't
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:58.240]  start and get orders it doesn't work like that it's just people that also want to resist this
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:01.840]  it's it's it's like vie for vendetta where everybody doesn't have to get orders they all
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:07.280]  just show up at the same time you get what i'm saying sir you hit it right on the head what's
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:13.040]  different now and why the organizations in the government cannot function anymore is the fact
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:20.480]  that the internet was used when i first learned about it in 1973 when i was studying at mit we
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:26.880]  learned the internet and social media so imagine that that was 73 that was funded by darpa and the
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:34.480]  cia 30 40 years later the difference is that we the people are now using the internet to undermine
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:40.640]  the credibility of the government so no matter what obama says he's not relevant he gave a lecture
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:47.520]  last night as to why trump could not be the president united states it's absurd that a a man like him
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:53.920]  who had no skills whatsoever none had never accomplished anything in the world was reduced
[2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:59.200]  to the fact that he's giving a lecture as if he were a professor when in fact he was nothing
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:05.760]  he's just a cia little operative who they pump right up to the system and he got in through lying
[2:38:05.760 --> 2:38:12.080]  cheating the chicago mill so what's happening is you just keep doing what you're doing don't worry
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:17.440]  about it keep uncovering what you consider to be the truth and what we know to be the truth will
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:23.680]  there be another false flag probably there are only so many things this government is able to do and
[2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:29.840]  believe me they're getting less and less effective more importantly is that the government's going
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:35.360]  off on its own it doesn't really care what the american people says the president can make all
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:40.960]  kinds of treaties which have very little relevance to us it's never been it's never been more obvious
[2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:48.640]  it's just a breakaway rogue government well you know we allowed it to happen uh we gave a funding
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:54.240]  to a bunch of people who are called legislators who sit there do nothing really most of the time
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:38:59.360]  they spend most of their time the senators and congressmen just going through process and going
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:05.200]  on junkets and they're not relevant to us in the 21st century believe me they're not relevant
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:11.200]  and in fact there's a real issue now as to whether a president is relevant in my opinion
[2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:16.160]  not the worst well you always talk about how incompetent their their information warfare
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:23.840]  is based on lies i mean their counterpoints are all written scripts of the stupidest stuff
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:27.600]  that that i would write to discredit myself if i was doing that i mean they're just so
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:35.920]  sophomoric well here's the point the point is very simple they're not functional they forget
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:40.720]  or they don't want to mention that hillary clinton obama cement the power susan wright's
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:46.800]  created the disaster they had in libya now what are they saying oh we can correct that a disaster
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:52.000]  instead of just attacking libya we'll attack it again in order to form a new government that was
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:58.160]  exactly the same stupid reasoning that occurred in the iraq situation that occurred in afghanistan
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:05.200]  and yemen and sudan so you have a repetition of stupidity which has to stop and the american
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:10.880]  public has to say you know what we're not going overseas in a way i had wished we had to draft
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:16.800]  because the most important deterrent to going overseas are going to an unnecessary battles
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:22.480]  of the mothers who go out into the streets and say no i'm not going to sacrifice my son
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:27.920]  you didn't see bush sacrificed any of his son you didn't see clinton sacrifice social engineering
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:34.080]  about trying to put women in front line combat well what they're doing is giving a basically
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:40.240]  they're trying to do what the israeli model is is to integrate women into the social system and be
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:46.240]  responsive to the legal imperatives of having women do equal duty whether they can or not
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:52.080]  quite frankly i don't know i do know that women in the intelligence service particularly in human
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:58.160]  are extremely good in many ways i find them overall to be somewhat superior to the men
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:03.360]  but that's in my business and human and other elements of intelligence because they're far
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:10.560]  more sophisticated in absorbing contra a span of contradictions and simultaneous problems
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:16.640]  as opposed to men but that's my prejudice the reality is we're not we're feminizing our army
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:22.480]  we don't have an army we have 2.2 million people but our teeth to tail ratio that means the people
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:28.960]  who actually fight compared to the support group is so small we maybe have 15 or 20 000 who can
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:35.760]  fight it most we have 4 000 going into jabuti in in in cote d'voile which gets sent around all
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:42.640]  african do we really belong in african no do we really belong in iraq or afghanistan well that's
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:46.880]  my next question what is in your expert view dr steve cenic's our guest steve cenic.com
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:53.760]  what is the state of the world geopolitical and military situation right now uh talk of this
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:59.280]  leading into major world wars vinyedyev the russian prime minister not really no the what i'm looking at
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:05.520]  is a far more serious problem than major wars of combat what i'm looking at is the fact that china
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:12.960]  not purposely but china inadvertently is going down the tube very quickly financially
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:20.480]  president jiji pong is not capable of handling the fundamental problem which is structural
[2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:28.640]  in china and that they have to transform from an export to a consumer economy where the people
[2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:35.200]  are getting paid more and there's no more slave labor like they have in vietnam so the president is
[2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:41.920]  losing and jiji pong is losing an immense amount of dollars or wands and it's devaluating very quickly
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:48.800]  which will create a deflationary spiral all over the world on the other side i have russia having
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:54.800]  the same problem oil has dropped down our sanctions have been effective and the ruble has gone down
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:43:00.400]  immensely so the real war that's going on is not with bullets economic not even in syria it's
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:07.760]  economic and fortunately for the geniuses in 1944 and december 27th who created the brettanwood
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:14.080]  conference we americans are fortunate because they forced the entire world to get denominated
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:19.680]  against the dollar not against the war and this is the problem we have the corrupt decadent delusional
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:24.640]  elite stolen valor hillary clinton like brian williams lying about all our combat you know in
[2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:31.680]  syria and the rest of it this ridiculous garbage or bosnia and they've now inherited all this american
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:37.120]  century all the american ingenuity all the american master planning and even the inheriting the
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:43.680]  british empire and they're just sitting on top of it ruining our name bankrupting us still people
[2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:49.040]  inside the american empire running it but it's falling apart as a bunch of heroes you know run
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:55.200]  around on top of it taking four month vacations so so where do you see that going as that very elite
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:44:00.720]  in vibes and leftist ideology and wants to mop up the libertarian movement in america
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:07.040]  thus killing the golden goose i mean i i mean i really see them really wanting to crush an american
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:13.920]  renaissance when that american renaissance is their only hope well the reality is whether the
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:20.960]  wealthy the wealthy just lost about 25 to 30 percent of the net worth in the past six to eight
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:28.560]  weeks china lost in the past six to eight weeks 10 trillion dollars worth of want in their economy
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:34.800]  so what's going to happen on this economic warfare is as we have deflation and the value
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:40.160]  of assets start going down and we have a federal reserve that really doesn't know what it's doing
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:46.160]  yellen has no idea went to increase the rate and went to decrease it we're going to be handed
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:53.840]  a double situation deflation and possible inflation and that's stagflation so the real
[2:44:53.840 --> 2:45:00.320]  war that we have is an economic war not against china not even against russia but internally
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:06.720]  we have to start manufacturing we have to stop allowing our government our industries to go to
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:12.560]  mexico and vietnam selling them off is correct that's correct reason hedge funds the hedge funds
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:18.400]  have to be disbanded there's no reason why we have big banks what about china trying to buy the
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:22.880]  chicago mercantile exchange i mean that sounds like they just want to buy off all that fraud to
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:28.560]  prop themselves up well they can try to buy anything they want but the truth of the matter is like
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:34.960]  japan went around 20 years ago buying up everything we had they've been lost it because china cannot
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:41.440]  sustain a drainage over 10 trillion dollars their federal reserves and their currency reserves
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:46.480]  are in the billions and they're losing it they have to maintain a liquidity that they can't
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:52.160]  manage in short what i'm saying to the audience is america is still very powerful it doesn't
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:59.280]  matter if i got mickey mouse there donald duck or obama the truth of the matter is the infrastructure
[2:45:59.280 --> 2:46:04.320]  where i have the governors and the commissioners on a much more local level functioning and the
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:11.040]  american individual is really creating his or her own in business and having the cash flows they need
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:16.880]  we will still sustain our greatness as for the people on top they're not going to be as relevant
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:22.320]  if you think that a scalia was that important not really the only one who really damaged
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:27.840]  the whole system was roberts when he created the notion that a company is an individual and
[2:46:27.840 --> 2:46:33.040]  therefore you could have as much money as you wanted to trump is stopping that he's basically
[2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:38.560]  saying look i'm a billionaire i don't need the money i don't care about the favors i don't need
[2:46:38.560 --> 2:46:43.760]  to have well as you said we have to have the henry ford idea he was a bad guy in some ways
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:47.840]  but good and others that your employees got enough enough money to buy your product there's
[2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:52.400]  got to be an economy they just can't game it suck it all dry they're gonna live in giant palaces
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:56.880]  surrounded by ghettos we really don't want to go this third world model that they're trying to sell
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:47:01.120]  that it's so great to be austere and all this garbage as soon as your new book comes out dr
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:05.360]  pochnick i want to have you on give us a sneak peek thank you in the next 60 seconds about your
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:10.880]  new book folks can find out about it yeah it's called teodor it's about a woman who was brave
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:16.720]  enough to leave france germany spain portugal and come to the united states because she loved her
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:22.800]  sons and she loved america she loved it so much i called it teodor that was my mother so it's an
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:28.720]  interesting book it's a book about what happens when you have the need for survival and the need
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:34.400]  for love that's it love and survival of the only two things that count in this country and in this
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:41.840]  world she loved america and america loved her and that's why i end this talk with you we're a great
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:49.840]  country we shouldn't give up we shouldn't stop our protests and you should not stop your discussions
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:54.880]  on what's happening the truth of the matter is we're hurting them very badly and what you're
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:48:01.920]  seeing is a frightened animal on all sides on obama on the bush is in the clinton because this is the
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:07.520]  last gasp they have before they go down and they know it so they're going to hit a lot more and if
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:12.880]  we keep trump up there and ironically sanders who's a social democrat he's pulling all the
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:18.000]  boats away from hillary it's become a paradox of irony well dr pochnick i thought the book was
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:24.160]  coming out is it out yet it is out yeah that'll it'll come out and you'll have a uh a site there
[2:48:24.160 --> 2:48:27.600]  where it can be brought absolutely well steve pochnick.com has the link to it i guess it's
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:33.360]  pre-orders now uh but i want to get you on as soon as it comes out to really talk about your mom and
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:38.640]  your interesting life i mean i guess out of russia into europe then into cuba then into the united
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:42.960]  states and i know a lot of what you've been a lot of what you've been involved in has been classified
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:47.120]  but and of course we talk about some of it then you get the justice department is opinioning you but
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:51.840]  i tell you just amazing life you've had so far and i don't know how much of it you can get into
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:57.840]  here on the air let me tell you i love the fbi and they they take care of me but truthfully they have
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:03.840]  to hand me the subpoenas that are ordered from the the department of justice and the state department
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:08.000]  that's part of the give and take my friend and they're gonna harass you they're gonna harass me
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:12.880]  and they'll harass many others but as long as we believe in this country and as long as we believe
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:20.160]  the ability to protest we'll do okay no one but no one will touch you trust me alex they're smart
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:24.400]  enough to understand the best thing they could do is to leave you alone to leave me well i know
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:29.280]  there's anywhere i go now when crazies come after me police just pop out of the woodwork and stop them

[2:54:18.640 --> 2:54:22.640]  we have a limited edition that's hillary for present and beyond but her is the joker on the
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:28.320]  front saying what difference does it make and on the back it's the campaign style shirt uh like
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:36.000]  the original uh but a little bit different design saying hillary for present 2016 and beyond info

[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:47.680]  popular and it's got five star reviews from folks that have already gotten there is a very very nice
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:52.160]  shirt to keep it very inexpensive it was like printed in honduras or the the cotton's from
[2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:56.480]  there was made you know shown together in uh you know the stamps and all of it here in the
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:00.000]  united states most of our shirts are actually made in the us but that boosts the price up to
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:04.720]  like 25 bucks so these political ones we are just churning out what difference does it make anyways
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:09.680]  as hillary says and let's see what she had to say about this shirt at a speech in harlem yesterday
[2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:17.040]  another coughing fit or running the legal clinic at the university of arkansas to represent inmates
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:20.560]  excuse me
[2:55:23.440 --> 2:55:24.560]  she's been doing this for months
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:31.360]  look creature too much to say
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:39.920]  i'll get you and your little dog too
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:51.520]  that's been that's been that's been part of my mission oh she's falling
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:56.720]  she's super sick representing the wolves are surrounding her scalia's a message everybody
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:04.240]  to back off might be it was about making people's this just goes on and on let's just stop it let's
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:09.600]  just stop it by the way joe bigs they had to go on to the next location with some big breaking
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:13.520]  news on the death of scalia i'm just gonna leave it at that no other media is doing this i'm not
[2:56:13.520 --> 2:56:18.240]  bragging i don't want to be in that position but it's our responsibility we're gonna do it and he
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:21.840]  wasn't irritated without to cut him off for the last guest but he wants to tell more later they
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:29.440]  got harassed really bad out there uh at the ranch where scalia died and um you know we have ways of
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:35.280]  looking into that let's leave it at that just look for some really big breaking news
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:39.920]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i am completely out of control today
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:45.200]  there is so much earth shattering news i got to about 10 of it i haven't even taken calls but but
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:50.400]  we've been focusing on the big narrative here and that is the establishment doesn't control the
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:56.400]  narrative and doesn't run the show and not everybody's a coward and not everybody cares what the
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:00.960]  mainstream media says and now folks are learning when you get attacked by the mainstream media you
[2:57:00.960 --> 2:57:07.280]  rise like a donald trump like a matt drugs like an elix Jones and so that's why people like
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:14.880]  tucker carlson who's smart guy used to criticize me years ago he can now come along and be even
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:20.000]  more hardcore because he always wanted to be he genuinely now i know he's a patriot libertarian
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:25.600]  guy he can be more hardcore now because now it's safer to do and that's okay just like it was safer
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:30.400]  after i came out and said investigate this is a homicide saturday that's the state law by the way
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:37.760]  and now that's top story at rug report dot com or was earlier today uh and again it's not hey look
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:43.280]  what we did again look what we did again it's that you have power i didn't get trained by guys in
[2:57:43.280 --> 2:57:47.120]  black sunglasses okay and i'm not saying there aren't some good people that have been trained
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:51.280]  like that but you get put in a system and controlled and compartmentalized i'm not
[2:57:51.280 --> 2:57:57.680]  compartmentalized i have been a wild man since the day i was born and i am organic and real
[2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:02.240]  and that's why they try to constantly claim i'm a government agent around the cia i wouldn't want
[2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:09.280]  to be in the cia that people to say that's so prestigious you heard larry nickles in the army
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:14.080]  working for those grips he said he knows everybody was dying by 35 they were killing them they were
[2:58:14.080 --> 2:58:20.800]  getting rid of them i saw that happen folks with my family people go all up the proof he's in it
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:27.840]  no no no i told you i know it's bad i'm not in it see so yeah i guess that's one reason i'm not
[2:58:27.840 --> 2:58:32.960]  an idiot it is because i guess i come from stock in texas on both sides of my family
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:37.600]  that you know the government knew would get the job done but that wasn't our government that was
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:41.920]  criminals you understand that that's the difference so yeah i guess i do come from the stuff that
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:46.560]  gets stuff done but i'm not in those agencies radio we'll be right back folks stay with us rob do

[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:06.160]  theories explained because she works for gawker she's a writer there so she is the authority
[3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:12.800]  on everything and uh here's a little link to the article right there it's got the who's who
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:20.480]  of suspects including an alien chupacabra and a prostitute and ted cruise or obama so she first
[3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:27.600]  attacks alex jones in the beginning of this um and then goes on to get weirder and weirder
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:34.240]  even talking about how spock did it let her name away so we invited her on i sent her that tweet
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:40.400]  and uh let's see what time it says 11 o 4 a.m center that likes to see if she would come on

[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:50.560]  probably how they operate at gawker although i wouldn't know because i don't take lunches i work

[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:20.400]  but first uh we just played during the break we had one of those one minute hot topics that we
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:26.240]  produce here every day um during the alex jones show here's the daily caller article marine
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:31.120]  allegedly assaulted mid burger at mcdonald's has gang yelled you believe black lives matter well i
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:36.240]  don't know if the assault is alleged um because they haven't on security camera they've seen it
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:41.040]  he's got a bump on his head he's been to the hospital so far marine became a target of an
[3:10:41.040 --> 3:10:46.560]  alleged assault in mcdonald's friday as a crowd of youths gathered cornered him and demanded
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:55.360]  ute well what's mr gambini what is a ute um that's some old humor from the 80s if you saw
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:10:59.600]  my cousin venny he demanded the uh he answered the question do you believe black lives matter
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:05.280]  before knocking him unconscious and robbing him no laughing matter there christopher marquez a
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:10.400]  veteran of iraq in a recipient of the brawn star for valor and i think he's even featured in a statue
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:15.840]  somewhere um commemorating one of the wars we've been in so he was dining at mcdonald's
[3:11:15.840 --> 3:11:19.920]  northeast dc and a group of black teenagers came up to him and allegedly began harassing him about
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:24.720]  black lives matter he ignored them which prompted the calls that he was a racist and if you're a
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:31.840]  racist then you get to be you get to play the knockout game because it's a game when young thugs
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:39.680]  knock you out it's a game it's not an assault it's a game notice how they play that on you
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:43.120]  d anthony mason manager of mcdonald's reviewed security footage and told marquez in a phone
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:46.240]  call that when he left the restaurant a team with the white shirt struck him on the side of
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:50.880]  the head knocking him unconscious the other teens then converged on his incapacitated body taking
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:57.840]  his belongings the head blow marquez is staying left his memory days but mason's review of the
[3:11:57.840 --> 3:12:01.840]  security footage helped him piece together what had happened yeah they hit him so hard he can remember
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:07.760]  what happened to him terrible but you know he didn't agree and didn't bow down to black lives
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:12.480]  matter the other authorities the social justice warrior authorities in this world telling us
[3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:17.360]  what we have to believe in and how we have to believe in it and if you don't you're a bona fide
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:22.800]  racist and here's an article i'm going to talk with about leon macadoo trump supporting eagles
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:29.200]  of death metal singer says guns could have stopped paris attacks she played a pretty amazing video
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:33.200]  of what went on they performed i guess last night or the night before back in france
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:39.440]  finishing the concert that they were unable to finish so we'll get more into that here's
[3:12:39.440 --> 3:12:46.240]  an interesting article here is faces budget crunch i'm sorry is i'm sorry isil i'm sorry isis
[3:12:46.240 --> 3:12:51.440]  i'm sorry al qaeda i'm sorry terrorists that we fund faces budget crunch cutting perks and trimming
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:55.680]  salaries faced with the cash shortage and its so-called caliphate the islamic state group has
[3:12:55.680 --> 3:13:00.160]  slashed salaries across the region and asked rocker residents to pay utility bills and black
[3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:05.680]  market american dollars and is now releasing detainees for a price of 500 a person they bragged
[3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:08.960]  about meeting their own currency and now they're having a hard time meeting expenses thanks to
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:13.360]  coalition airstrikes thanks to the russians really they're the ones who instigated those
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:19.440]  airstrikes back in november but there was something oh yeah having built up loyal among
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:24.640]  militants with good salaries and honeymoon and baby bonuses the group has stopped providing
[3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:30.640]  even smaller perks such as free energy drinks and snickers bars so no longer can they eat a
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:35.920]  snickers bar when they're feeling bad hey chill out i'm akmed or mohammed whatever your name
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:40.800]  have a snickers bar we're about to behead some people and on that same front syrian refugees
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:47.520]  admitted to us since paris attack 602 muslims two christians that's not a nice score especially
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:54.320]  since the christians are the ones getting persecuted in syria so but that's how it goes
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:13:59.120]  so uh without further ado let's go to this video we played on the info wars nightly news last night
[3:14:00.720 --> 3:14:03.600]  it has to do with anton Antonin Scalia
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:12.560]  and how in the town of foul furious which is a little bit of ways a few hours away from them
[3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:19.360]  near the border they pay for autopsies for every dead illegal they find anybody they find dead they
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:26.000]  give them an autopsy no matter what so dead illegals are getting autopsies and scalia nothing for him
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:32.720]  so let's go to this report now from john benn what can he do to me or to any of us we have
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:39.360]  life tenure and we have it precisely so that we will not be influenced by by politics by threats
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:46.880]  from from anybody what the hell is this that's a syrian message that means local brassie sleeps
[3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:53.200]  with the fishes associate justice of the supreme court antonin scalia was appointed in 1986 by
[3:14:53.200 --> 3:14:58.880]  president ronald reagan scalia served as a safeguard for the constitution a staunch opponent to the
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:04.480]  liberal viewpoint that the constitution is a living document to be interpreted by progressive
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:09.920]  demands scalia held true to his beliefs as an originalist meaning the constitution cannot
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:15.520]  be changed or misinterpreted unless subjected to the lengthy congressional process of amendment
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:21.120]  and also as a textualist concluding that the ordinary meaning not an interpretation of the
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:26.160]  text of the constitution should guide its governance clearly this viewpoint counters
[3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:32.320]  president obama's quasi progressive conquest to fundamentally transform the united states
[3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:38.320]  obama's violation of the constitution as a constant even as he faces the lame duck presidency
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:44.480]  but with scalia gone and the possibility of obama's free speech assailing lackey loretta
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:50.320]  lynch receiving the supreme court nomination obama could find himself in the driver's seat
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:56.640]  once again making tracks down the road to tyranny before his term ends scalia's swing vote on the
[3:15:56.640 --> 3:16:02.320]  issues including abortion clinic closures in texas a public sector union fair share fee ruling
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:08.240]  a university of texas affirmative action case and obama cares violation of religious freedom
[3:16:08.240 --> 3:16:14.640]  via no cost access to birth control for religious nonprofits were small potatoes compared to the
[3:16:14.640 --> 3:16:21.760]  two cases causing the treasonous obama administration to sweat first with scalia gone obama's shielding
[3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:27.440]  of four million illegal aliens only needs one conservative vote to sway to the liberal side
[3:16:27.440 --> 3:16:32.960]  or an expedited installation of a liberal judge to break the tie that would preserve the lower
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:39.120]  court's block of obama's full-on assault of our immigration system second and this is the case that
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:45.600]  stinks of motive obama's clean power plan to regulate carbon emissions this is obama's gift
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:51.600]  to his globalist banker cohorts the liberal dc circuit court ruling could serve it up to an
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:57.680]  obama dominated supreme court signed sealed and delivered before obama leaves office obama claims
[3:16:57.680 --> 3:17:02.960]  he won't use the nuclear option and appointed justice while the senate is in recess although he
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:08.480]  does have a small window to appoint a temporary replacement and as we all know when obama says
[3:17:08.480 --> 3:17:14.880]  he will not do or sign something that usually means he will unfortunately for obama though
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:20.400]  two years ago the supreme court weakened the president's ability to use the nuclear option
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:27.760]  power upon hearing scalia's death due to natural causes most people brushed it off he was 79 years
[3:17:27.760 --> 3:17:34.160]  old but then the fumbling of the details began prosidio county judge cinderella govera pronounced
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:40.560]  scalia dead due to natural causes without seeing the body or even ordering an autopsy if you believe
[3:17:40.560 --> 3:17:46.640]  that you we ought to go back to monarchy that the people are such sheep that they just swallow
[3:17:46.640 --> 3:17:51.840]  whatever whatever they see on television or read in the newspapers and the highly decorated
[3:17:51.840 --> 3:17:58.560]  vietnam veteran and prized democratic party donor and cebolo creek ranch owner john poindexter
[3:17:58.560 --> 3:18:04.000]  continually changed his story until he finally blurted out that scalia was found with a pillow
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:09.840]  over his head and the sheets were unwrinkled the washington post reports quote william o richie
[3:18:09.840 --> 3:18:14.560]  a former commander and former head of criminal investigations for dc police wrote you have a
[3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:20.400]  supreme court justice who died not in attendance of a physician you have a non-homicide trained
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:26.160]  u.s. marshal tell the justice of the piece that no foul play was observed you have a justice of
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:31.920]  the piece pronounced death while not being on the scene and without any medical training
[3:18:31.920 --> 3:18:39.040]  opining that the justice died of a heart attack what medical proof exists of a myocardial infarction
[3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:45.760]  why not a cerebral hemorrhage end quote any signs of strangulation uncovered by a mandatory
[3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:52.080]  standard autopsy such as petechial hemorrhage would have sounded off alarm bells yet an autopsy of
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:58.080]  one of the most powerful people in the united states was neglected meanwhile towns like
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:05.200]  falferious texas shell out money they don't have to perform autopsies on illegal aliens the meager
[3:19:05.200 --> 3:19:11.360]  funds that brooks county accumulates from their property taxes and funds given to them by the
[3:19:11.360 --> 3:19:18.560]  state of texas and not the federal government go here to bury undocumented migrants crossing
[3:19:18.560 --> 3:19:23.440]  you see that's how it works the border just and john bound went on the ground to prove it you know
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:29.120]  they are paying for autopsies for illegals but we can't get one for scalia and that there's the

[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:46.080]  government is there to pick winners and losers just like what we saw when david knight went to go
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:52.560]  talk to the judge in this small town of marfa texas the one who said ah natural causes go
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:56.560]  ahead and take the body everything's cool we're not going to go down there she didn't want to go
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:02.560]  as as the i guess that's the code you're either unable to go or you're able to go and the first
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:10.560]  two people they contacted to come and look at the judge scalia's body weren't able to go the third
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:15.760]  just said eh we'll just do this over the phone i don't need to be there because i don't want to

[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:29.040]  she owed him any explanation whatsoever to her actions except for saying procedure was followed
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:34.080]  but not about the timeline not who ordered what when don't worry about that those are questions

[3:27:48.080 --> 3:27:52.000]  league government doc shows what's really behind global warming agenda profound lifestyle changes
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:59.520]  and that is what it's all about the elites want to live just as they're living now and
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:03.840]  keep the technology for themselves so they can live a more empowered life
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:08.080]  while turning us into serfs they and to do that they have to get rid of the middle class
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:11.760]  which is why you got people like bernie sanders chilling around saying it's the middle class
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:18.480]  causing all these problems and uh i guarantee you if he was to get in and make these tax changes
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:22.960]  they wouldn't be going to the ultra point zero zero zero percent they would be finding a way
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:27.520]  to get around to me would only be the worker bees out there the people that keep this country
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:33.520]  moving and uh the the small business owners people like that but that's what this is about
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:39.200]  i did a report a few years ago how on the west coast they were banning people from having fires
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:45.200]  if they saw smoke coming out of their chimneys they would get fined and you know wood burning stoves
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:50.000]  is how most people get their heat especially older people who've been in their houses for a long
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:52.720]  time they don't have central heat they might have a little space heater but the one way
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:56.880]  they were heating their houses through wood burning stoves and now they make wood burning
[3:28:56.880 --> 3:29:01.360]  stoves that don't work i did a lot of research on this they had people putting these brand new
[3:29:01.360 --> 3:29:06.720]  stoves in their garages and going why this thing working the other one worked great why do we get
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:10.240]  why do we get rid of that other stove that one works so good we had to pay more for this one
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:15.280]  to don't work that's my good old boy impression and that's what and that's what it is it's not
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:19.200]  about making things work better that's why you have a toilet that you have to flush three times
[3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:24.480]  to get number two to go down because they want to make everything make it smaller make us live
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:29.520]  in cramped houses where we're you know we don't have any freedom that's what it's all about making
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:35.120]  us conform to what they think we should live and that is what it's all about right there
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:39.840]  so we're gonna have uh leah macadoon the next segment mary in new jersey i'm gonna come to you

[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:29.920]  so if you're listening over the break i talked about the magic pillow theory here's my tweet
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:34.880]  from this morning again the story changes hashtag scalia death i put the link to the daily mail
[3:33:34.880 --> 3:33:44.000]  article next no pillow in the room that's what's going to be next hey buddy and this is funny this
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:48.560]  is the sheriff who claims he was the first on the scene i was first on the scene when he wasn't
[3:33:48.560 --> 3:33:53.360]  it was the owner of the ranch who came in and said hey i found him lying down with a pillow over his
[3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:59.360]  head and this guy goes no you had to pull behind his head above his head is what he said above his
[3:33:59.360 --> 3:34:04.720]  head which seems really weird to say above and above is in all caps in the daily mail article
[3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:08.400]  let's click on that link let's just read that headline for everybody
[3:34:10.480 --> 3:34:16.560]  exclusive justice scalia was not all caps found with a pillow over his face it was above
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:22.560]  his head reveals sheriff who was first on the scene sheriff dany demingas said there is nothing
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:28.480]  suspicious move along well why would you even bring that up in the first place then if it was
[3:34:28.480 --> 3:34:33.360]  yeah it was just exactly in a place where people would normally have their pillow no and that goes
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:39.680]  back to the the my san Antonio article where the the owner john pointexter was saying he died peacefully
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:45.120]  in the night how do you know that how do you know how do you know what if it was early in the morning
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:50.880]  you don't know right do you know how do you know leah mackey who's joining me we're going to take
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:56.640]  some phone calls we also have on info wars dot com judge speaks out on scalia we normally perform
[3:34:56.640 --> 3:35:01.760]  on top she's because that's sop standard operating procedure and i was kit daniels talking to the
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:08.240]  justice a piece of persideo county why need a bishop who was unable to make it she was unable
[3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:14.400]  to go because that's their code word i can't go i'm unable to go i'm able to go and then they go
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:20.800]  his government bureaucrats god so there were other two others that weren't able to go exactly well
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:24.480]  she was one of them and then there was another one and then it was cinderella cinderella was able
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:29.280]  to find the glass slipper and make sure it fit let's go to mary in new jersey she's a nurse who
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:36.240]  wants to talk about scalia mary what do you have to add to the conversation okay you can't say that
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:45.600]  these people are guilty but i can to me they are anytime anytime a person dies outside of the hospital
[3:35:45.600 --> 3:35:52.160]  it's not just under doctor's care but specifically it should be like they're under hospice care
[3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:59.520]  expected to die imminently it's any any patient and that's and that's any person that dies outside
[3:35:59.520 --> 3:36:08.080]  of a hospital or 24 hours within admission is a coroner's case and the story and that judge
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:13.680]  that uh wrote them all she's guilty and she knows that she didn't follow proper she should be
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:19.840]  prosecuted the owner of the ranch the sheriff because they all covered up a crime scene yeah
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:24.400]  there you go it doesn't matter his status it doesn't matter his status that's why they did it
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:30.560]  it's everyone exactly because we need to know if there was a murder taking place because if there
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:34.160]  was then we need to find out who did it and the only way to find out who did is to say how they
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:39.840]  died and if it was from strangulation then that's one thing if it's poisoning that's another thing
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:45.280]  there's all these different clues onto how he could have died right if he died if he was murdered by
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:51.680]  somebody you know by hand and and we pointed that out in our report john bound pointed it out no
[3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:57.120]  autopsy for scalia yet mandatory autopsies for illegals people they find dead you know on private
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:00.960]  property they go they don't have a they don't contact a family member and go hey do you want to
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:06.400]  do an autopsy no they just do it because these people might have been murdered right right and he
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:12.480]  he looked very healthy for his uh for 76 i've seen a lot of people that age he looked very healthy
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:17.040]  except he smoked um but you know he was well enough to go on a hunting trip for the weekend
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:20.320]  he was well enough to hang out and eat dinner with people bernie sanders is well enough to
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:27.120]  run for president yeah at age so exactly it was very healthy so these people including the people
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:34.240]  that uh at the top need to be prosecuted sure he isn't beyond this but oh i'm sure but obama
[3:37:34.240 --> 3:37:40.320]  was in on this thank you mary conspiracy theorist from new jersey all right let's go to max in canada
[3:37:40.320 --> 3:37:50.640]  wants to talk about trump hello hey max what's going on hi just had a quick point um there was two
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:56.800]  separate videos today of uh donald trump mentioning the 28 pages actually one in a fox
[3:37:56.800 --> 3:38:01.680]  interview and one in a speech today in bluffs in south carolina wow just wanted to point that out
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:07.600]  then he uh mentioned um he didn't call it the 20 pages he called it secret documents and secret
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:13.920]  papers uh in one and the other instance so that was very interesting very and we didn't have to
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:17.840]  press him to say it he said it under his own volition we weren't twisting his arm you know we
[3:38:17.840 --> 3:38:22.480]  went as jeb bush the same question when you like to see him yeah yeah you got him well as a brother
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:27.760]  to declassify him you got him you got to have him you you got him you know andrea might have him
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:32.160]  andrea maybe she's got him probably see them that's weird how andrea mitchell suddenly appears behind
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:37.680]  richard reeves and goes hey let me say it's totally creepy if you don't know what i'm talking about uh
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:45.760]  go to jake i think it's jeb bush mocks victims family 9 11 victims families and he he the way he
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:50.240]  answers that question is the total mocking of everybody who died 9 11 and people who want to
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:54.400]  see oh yeah you know what's in that commission report will you declassify it as president will
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:59.600]  you gotta see the 28 pages i mean people want to know you got him yeah you got him your brothers
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:03.360]  probably got him thanks for pointing that out max well and i really appreciate what the chenic had
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:08.080]  to say on the show today about you know heads are going to roll and i agree that you know
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:12.640]  with trump just kind of saying if you dare go there he's like the only person that's been able
[3:39:12.640 --> 3:39:17.680]  to break through and trump is just a manifestation of also what he's saying nobody believes the
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:21.440]  government anymore whatever they say they could come out and say the sky's blue and i'd be like
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:26.320]  well i don't know let's let's let's go out and look at the sky real quick actually isn't blue
[3:39:26.320 --> 3:39:30.160]  because i'm not going to trust these people is any farther than i can throw them through the
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:36.560]  atmosphere all right it's not really blue so uh let's go to daryl in texas let's talk about
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:43.040]  skali are you south texas north texas will part of texas well i'm about an hour east of round rock
[3:39:43.040 --> 3:39:51.360]  okay central um hey first i just want to really say how proud i am of y'all because uh no one is
[3:39:51.360 --> 3:39:56.480]  covering the skali a story uh no one is really covering the zika virus more i can understand
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:40:02.800]  and uh made me so proud to see everybody coming together everybody seems stepping up too and uh
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:11.200]  doing more interviews going out sort being their own uh and uh alex uh he's really uh the fact that
[3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:17.360]  he has picked up on the story and saw it as newsworthy immediately immediately he saw it as
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:23.280]  newsworthy when everyone just wants you to move along folks yep yeah he he came out started asking
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:27.280]  the questions and he does these facebook mentions this was live i was actually here on saturday
[3:40:27.280 --> 3:40:33.120]  i shot a 16 minute video with him and then a uh four to five minute video on the pope with him
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:37.680]  and we got done and i i took those to go edit them and get them ready for the uh sunday show
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:43.040]  because he wanted to play those during the sunday show and right as i left i started getting uh
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:47.600]  ticks on my phone saying so and so is coming on facebook mentions so he was doing a facebook
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:51.760]  mentions after that and that's when they found out about skali a during i think during the facebook
[3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:57.520]  mentions and then you see alex go immediately into war game mode thinking of all the possibilities
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:01.200]  because he's not just going to stand by and go well they said it was natural cars let's just open
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:05.280]  and shut case okay let's move along talk about something else he sat there in war game did of
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:09.760]  all the different possibilities that could happen you're not supposed to further investigate
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:14.880]  when the authorities tell you it's right open and shut case that's right no autopsy let's
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:21.440]  embalm him immediately speaking in my npr voice everything is fine the judge died peacefully
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:29.200]  his bedclothes were unwrinkled unwrinkled yeah like what episode really interesting random detail
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:34.960]  is like a weird episode of x5 just like the uh pillow but you know other people uh former intel
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:41.040]  officers say could be foul play uh who's william ritchie former head of criminal investigations
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:46.720]  for dc police uh darryl you're also talking about zika so one guy who did speak out against zika
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:51.520]  it was quickly shut down by all the people who know everything the priests of power oh my george
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:57.280]  takaya falls for zika virus conspiracy theory uh you know and he says zika virus not to blame
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:01.520]  dr sight man made cause for birth defect epidemic and the man made cause seems to be
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:06.320]  overuse of pesticides and overuse of vaccinations that compromise your immune system allows them
[3:42:06.320 --> 3:42:11.040]  pesticides to go in it right in the drinking water yeah but that's normal to kill the mosquito
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:15.120]  larva that's right i mean really you don't think there's going to be some repercussions mr
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:21.040]  sulu is a conspiracy theorist for george thanks for speaking out we need more people to speak out
[3:42:21.040 --> 3:42:26.320]  we need people to come out and say look this is horse s hi right we're able to fix we're not in
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:31.760]  your trance exactly taking your shots let's go to jeff in canada let's talk about the takeover of
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:37.280]  the usa you got wait is canada gonna take over the usa do we need to blame canada jeff what's
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:44.000]  going on well i think at the current rate donald trump will build a wall between canada and mexico
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:49.840]  so you don't have to worry about us being a threat anyway shape before maple syrup invaders all right
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:52.880]  so what's going on what do you think's gonna happen how do you think this will the takeover
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:42:58.320]  will happen who's going to take us over well you know what if the takeover happened a long
[3:42:58.320 --> 3:43:05.360]  time ago the takeover as you know happened in 1871 that this is just the end of a long long
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:11.840]  miserable story that we call the republic of america it's dead when i called into your producer i
[3:43:11.840 --> 3:43:16.960]  said my my my subject would be the decline and fall of america because what you are witnessing
[3:43:16.960 --> 3:43:22.560]  right now is truly that and i hope you can hear that in my voice because i'm i'm i'm not calling
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:29.920]  from canada to make a joke about anything right now um this death we are so close to the edge of
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:35.680]  the precipice if they can kill this man in his sleep with a pillow imagine what's in store for
[3:43:35.680 --> 3:43:41.280]  the average american and i'm i'm i'm very serious about this i totally hear the seriousness in your
[3:43:41.280 --> 3:43:47.440]  voice i i agree with you 100 percent keep going i i don't think canadians and americans truly
[3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:57.040]  appreciate the the connections that both countries have economically militarily uh uh on so many
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:44:03.280]  levels in the new world order scheme of tanks and when the elephant sneezes the 10 000 pound
[3:44:03.280 --> 3:44:09.360]  elephant in the room being our southern cousins and brothers and sisters it has serious ramifications
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:14.480]  on canadian and i think and i challenge canadian and americans on both sides of the border
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:20.960]  to seriously ponder what i'm saying right now and seriously think about how close we truly are
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:29.840]  to watching the republic turn into a communist state and there will be a rest i can i i can
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:34.720]  assure you this will happen on both borders and when i look at walmart's here in canada the united
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:40.800]  states these will be the uh the places where they will take this and it will not take long to round
[3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:46.320]  people up and it was a little alarming for me to hear steve pacanik say to alex jones this afternoon
[3:44:46.320 --> 3:44:52.160]  that we're going to be all right the things are all right things are not all right things are not
[3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:58.960]  all right at all people are getting shot people are getting rounded up things are not all right
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:05.600]  and we must do something more and i'm really hard pressed to think what that what the solution is
[3:45:05.600 --> 3:45:11.920]  right now i really am i i'm really running out of things to say but well the solution is waking
[3:45:11.920 --> 3:45:16.640]  people up that we got to start there you have to get people out of their trance because there are
[3:45:16.640 --> 3:45:21.280]  still too many people asleep even though when the government comes out and says something we have 79
[3:45:21.280 --> 3:45:25.280]  percent of the people think there's something fishy about scaly's death at least in that one poll
[3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:32.160]  you know you you have to really look at the at where we've been just from my lifetime
[3:45:32.160 --> 3:45:37.360]  mm-hmm you know i was born in 74 and watching how things have gone downhill since then even
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:41.760]  though we have this incredible technology we have the technology to solve pretty much any problem
[3:45:41.760 --> 3:45:46.880]  we come up with that's the the gift of human intelligence is to be able to solve these problems
[3:45:46.880 --> 3:45:51.120]  instead of saying oh we have to make lifestyle changes or there's this new york times article
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:56.720]  that oh now there's e-commerce is bad because people get stuff in cardboard boxes and we
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:46:00.400]  don't know what to do with it well i bet we could figure out something to do with the cardboard
[3:46:00.400 --> 3:46:05.760]  boxes i bet we could figure out a plan that works i bet we could do all this stuff if we just sat
[3:46:05.760 --> 3:46:09.840]  down and worked on these problems instead of finger pointing and saying you're the cause of it you're
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:13.600]  the cause of let's sit down and come up with solutions to these problems that don't involve
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:19.520]  rounding people up and and integrating our lifestyle right exactly jeff thanks for the call
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:24.480]  appreciate it you've totally changed my tune i was going into gallows humor mode yeah because
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:29.040]  that's kind of where i i go and that's where my bit is i think that's so frustrating as well i know
[3:46:29.040 --> 3:46:33.760]  there's a quote i can't recall it right now but it talks about how you get people into such a state
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:40.000]  of chaos and in misery they'll be begging you to protect them and save them and people are begging
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:45.200]  and rallying behind a socialist who wants to change the whole fabric of our society
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:50.560]  has no plans for how he's going to pay for this 18 trillion dollars in additional debt oh he has
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:56.640]  plans oh don't worry he has plans they truly think the government who yes we will completely screw
[3:46:56.640 --> 3:47:02.320]  up a city like flint michigan right he's going to now all of a sudden do a great job at doling out
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:06.640]  the simple meager rations to the people these are the same people that put fluoride in your
[3:47:06.640 --> 3:47:11.680]  water and tell you it's for your teeth yet you swallow it right and if you read the back of your
[3:47:11.680 --> 3:47:15.680]  toothpaste it says don't eat the toothpaste because it's got fluoride in it and it's toxic and if you
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:19.840]  do eat it call poison control and it's a different kind of fluoride that they it's not even a good
[3:47:19.840 --> 3:47:26.320]  yes they put better fluoride in the toothpaste exactly it's uh they put hydrofluorosalic acid
[3:47:26.320 --> 3:47:33.600]  in your water uh or hydro or hexafluorosilicate that's you know that's why it is this is so
[3:47:33.600 --> 3:47:38.960]  important with the Scalia thing because of the fact that now they're using this as a political tool
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:44.320]  it is a major thing it's put a huge ripple and that's going to be probably the focus of this whole
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:49.680]  election season going forward and yeah well who are we going to put in there or should we let
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:54.560]  obama do it even though before they said we're not going to allow election year presidents to put in
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:47:59.040]  lifetime appointments well and because that is an aha as you walk out the door right
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:03.680]  that is a slap in the face as you walk out the door and now the white house has come out saying
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:10.880]  that obama regrets his filibuster of a supreme court nominee so here he is a total hypocrite
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:16.800]  saying that the the republicans standing up against this is unprecedented oh boulder dash
[3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:23.120]  but then he was one of a group of i think 23 other senators who tried to filibuster um
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:29.360]  um elito when they wanted to put in uh samuel elito in 2006 elito that's right so totally
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:34.160]  hypocritical but for i don't know why they don't think people are going to dig up their skeletons
[3:48:34.720 --> 3:48:39.200]  oh exactly oh it's just so fun to call them on this stuff as they go through steven and florida
[3:48:39.840 --> 3:48:45.360]  we've got a couple minutes left go ahead yeah hey good afternoon um okay a couple things real
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:50.240]  quick i wanted to comment on Scalia before i do that i mentioned your caller why don't
[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:56.480]  i harken back to the fiasco last week and week before with bundy up there in origan and i was
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:49:01.200]  really kind of surprised that you guys as far as i know never mentioned this because you guys were
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:07.760]  the ones that broke this what was behind that whole thing in in the bad off which was what you
[3:49:07.760 --> 3:49:14.320]  guys uncovered that harry reid and his son cut that deal behind closed doors with the tycom
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:18.160]  no we we definitely talked about we covered that are you talking about something with
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:22.880]  origan that we didn't cover no i covered that in depth with the mineral rights the mineral rights
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:28.560]  yeah i talked about that maybe you just aren't watching all of the stuff that we do uh steven
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:33.120]  i went and looked at a video yesterday that we put up in the afternoon we had 16 videos in front
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:37.200]  of it i'm like did we put this video up yesterday and i'm looking around for it i had to count 16
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:42.160]  videos back and that was this morning since then there's been four more videos put up we put out
[3:49:42.160 --> 3:49:47.840]  a lot of content yeah and what we don't do is there's some issues we'll cover for a while like this
[3:49:47.840 --> 3:49:51.520]  scalia thing we're going to cover this for a little while we covered origan it was a 40 day
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:55.280]  ordeal we didn't cover every day we didn't have reporters on the ground every day but we did cover
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:50:00.080]  it and i will say this we do our best and the voy fenicum was definitely murdered i think yeah i
[3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:04.640]  agree that's how i feel we do our best to try and get all of our videos and it was a pre-planned
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:09.680]  murder i think they were planning on killing somebody the mood had changed before well we also
[3:50:09.680 --> 3:50:14.080]  tried just for everyone out there if you go to the alex jones youtube channel you'll see there's
[3:50:14.080 --> 3:50:19.200]  playlists and so we try to move all of our reports into specific playlists so if you're in
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:24.000]  interested in more reports on the organ shooting it's there under a playlist so we got about 30
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:28.720]  seconds left steven finish up what you want to say i think cover will happen in origan i just didn't
[3:50:28.720 --> 3:50:35.840]  hear bringing back in from the nevada situation tying them together i did no tying them together
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:42.720]  that's what i'm saying now as far as the lia uh okay definitely with no autopsy done there's dirty

[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:26.960]  general demanding an investigation i know they're good people they're on our side but they need to
[3:55:26.960 --> 3:55:33.120]  hear from us because they need to push this until that judge is indicted and people don't know that
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:39.680]  judges can be impeached and as well as we have criminal charges against them and they need that
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:43.920]  and then you're gonna find this thing goes all the way up to the white house that's what i believe
[3:55:43.920 --> 3:55:48.480]  far school yeah so we're convinced for that well there you go thanks steven for that call
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:53.280]  jacari what's coming up on the news tonight like i said we'll have richard reese giving us the
[3:55:53.280 --> 3:55:59.040]  update on the campaign trail also larry summers in the war on cash and also uh paul joseph watch and
[3:55:59.040 --> 3:56:04.960]  talks to syrian girl about uh Saudi arabian war games and possible hostilities that could
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:09.600]  intel for syria i like how the guy that created the black hole that sucks all the money in via
[3:56:09.600 --> 3:56:15.120]  derivatives is now saying we got to ban cash well they want you to be in the cashless society as
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:18.640]  they can track everything you do they could spend your credit cards as they felt like it you know
[3:56:18.640 --> 3:56:24.000]  any number of things toadie summers doing the work of the big banks punch buttons into a computer
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:28.400]  to then print money so exactly another guy came out neil cash carry who was like the golden sacks
[3:56:28.400 --> 3:56:31.760]  bag man during the whole banking crisis has come out and pretty much said the same thing
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:36.480]  you know these people just have no like it's like we don't remember what you said four years ago
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:41.600]  we're just going to be stupid well i do expect us not to remember i mean you can even ask about
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:45.920]  the obama administration uh do you talk about stuff he said before he even got elected in
[3:56:45.920 --> 3:56:50.160]  office completely you could have video of him saying again and again you can keep your doctor
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:56.320]  and keep your doctor and he still says hallard didn't say that yeah pretty well memories of goldfish
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:01.920]  we got another time for one more car let's squeeze in bob from michigan
[3:57:04.560 --> 3:57:09.520]  yeah i just wanted to make the point that they play little lawyer games as far as the wording
[3:57:09.520 --> 3:57:14.320]  goes like i think the sheriff that was quoted about the pillow above his head he didn't show up
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:20.480]  till a half hour later so technically he did see the pillow not on his face because they probably
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:26.480]  had to take it off to get a positive identification on scalia yeah it was probably like this look um
[3:57:26.480 --> 3:57:32.000]  who is this guy let's oh hey it's scalia let's call let's call some people this guy doesn't
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:36.480]  look good yes so they removed the pillow to see who it was obviously point that is obviously
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:40.960]  seriously theories and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out yet we got daily mail going no
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:46.240]  it was above the head and i was first on the scene when he wasn't you know it's just it's just
[3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:52.000]  another lie another subterfuge it's like all the guys that took the headshot on obon or ben laden
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:56.880]  you know all the guys that that stormed the place and all the different stories and the blown up
[3:57:56.880 --> 3:58:01.120]  helicopter and then another blown up helicopter with a bunch of navy seals in it we're never
[3:58:01.120 --> 3:58:04.560]  going to learn the truth i don't think what difference does it make that's true do you have
[3:58:04.560 --> 3:58:11.600]  a snickers bar but we should send some snickers to isis yeah poor guys it's not enough to kill
[3:58:11.600 --> 3:58:15.440]  christians they need some snickers bars and monster energy drinks and red bull you know and
[3:58:15.440 --> 3:58:20.240]  airdrops of grenades and rocket launchers and yeah we'll mix it in there yeah there you go
