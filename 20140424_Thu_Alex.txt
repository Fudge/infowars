[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:25.600]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:25.600 --> 00:29.760]  for joining us on this Thursday transmission what we at all hope wouldn't happen but predicted
[00:29.760 --> 00:37.120]  wood is beginning a civil war is beginning to engulf areas of eastern Ukraine as Ukrainian
[00:37.120 --> 00:45.120]  Putsk coup military overthrown of course by Western governments the original government was
[00:45.120 --> 00:52.600]  I'm talking like Yoda now we saw the elected government overthrown a new government installed
[00:52.600 --> 00:59.680]  and they are saying that any of the towns that have basically voted with their feet or voted
[00:59.680 --> 01:07.600]  in referendums to join Mother Russia they were previously part of will be invaded and so tanks
[01:09.680 --> 01:17.920]  from Kiev and troops have entered Slovansk and there is street battles going on and burning
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.640]  buildings so there you go and the Russian foreign minister yesterday said we're going to play that
[01:24.640 --> 01:31.520]  clip again coming up that if any Russian citizens are attacked Russia will respond militarily quote
[01:31.520 --> 01:41.600]  just like they did in Pristina South Ossetia Abkhazia now of course he was talking about Georgia
[01:41.600 --> 01:50.000]  South Ossetia and Abkhazia I threw in Pristina even though that was a mistake to throw in Pristina
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.200]  from Kosovo that is the case where the Russians actually landed at the airport when they were
[01:55.200 --> 02:02.480]  engaging in ethnic cleansing of the Russian Slavik population in the area and did repel NATO
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.240]  so that's a repeat that the Russians will do what they say they're going to do so
[02:08.240 --> 02:12.800]  I made a mistake they're throwing in the wrong town in the wrong country but the reason my brain
[02:12.800 --> 02:19.280]  factoided to that was because I was going back in my memory to another time the Russians did that
[02:19.280 --> 02:24.320]  so this is really getting out of control obviously and we'll we'll break it down today Paul Watson's
[02:24.320 --> 02:30.480]  going to be joining us we got two stories up on info wars.com where the New York Times first we
[02:30.480 --> 02:34.960]  wrote about this last night the New York Times today retracted but in the back of their paper
[02:36.080 --> 02:41.520]  and New York Times publishes fabricated evidence of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine that's a
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.840]  video report by Paul Watson Kurt Nemo did a text report we should probably add Watson's video into
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.920]  this New York Times issues back page retraction on Russian troops in Ukraine photos turns out they
[02:53.920 --> 03:00.480]  photo shop them so that's the type of stuff going on to start a war kind of like William Randolph
[03:00.480 --> 03:07.440]  Hearst told Remington the famous painter you supply me the paintings of the Rough Riders on
[03:07.440 --> 03:14.160]  San Juan Hill in an imaginary war being heroes charging up the hill and I will supply you with
[03:14.160 --> 03:20.000]  the war you make the pictures I'll make the war what was the exact quote what was William Randolph
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.840]  Hearst's quote on uh to Remington when you guys looked that up William Randolph Hearst quote on
[03:27.840 --> 03:34.720]  Spanish American War I believe was you supply the pictures I'll supply the war the point is I'm
[03:34.720 --> 03:41.280]  I'm digressing there is a New York Times article out speaking of spinning things and and trying to
[03:41.280 --> 03:47.520]  misrepresent things to create more racial division and balkanization the headline is a defiant
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.560]  rancher savers the audience that rallied to his side and as soon as I read this this morning
[03:53.360 --> 03:59.200]  where he said basically blacks would be better off being slaves again than being you know slaves
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.400]  for the government I knew when I called the bundies this morning and I talked to him he's coming on
[04:04.400 --> 04:10.240]  the next segment what they were going to say I said what do you mean by that well slavery is
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.880]  terrible but it's just another form of slavery today and I told the crew I said watch when I call
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.400]  them they're going to say this how do I know what they'd say because Reverend Childress basically
[04:18.400 --> 04:24.880]  says the same thing uh the other guests a C. L. Bryant former head of the NAACP up in Garland
[04:24.880 --> 04:30.480]  in Dallas says the same thing they say they replace one evil with another and that family life
[04:31.280 --> 04:38.400]  was stronger under oppression statistically than it is under this new soft kill so that's what
[04:38.400 --> 04:46.560]  Bundy said and granted Bundy is kind of a fossil vestigial old-time Americana who just says what
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.440]  he thinks so we'll get it from the horse's mouth straight ahead but they're going to go crazy with
[04:51.440 --> 04:55.760]  this and now if you're for land rights or property rights or against the feds tasering you you're a
[04:55.760 --> 05:02.560]  racist I mean we knew this was coming and here we go from the water table to our soils to the
[05:02.560 --> 05:08.080]  atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just
[05:08.080 --> 05:13.360]  the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[05:13.360 --> 05:18.160]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their time inside
[05:18.160 --> 05:23.760]  using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[05:23.760 --> 05:28.960]  well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact
[05:28.960 --> 05:33.360]  that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.800]  these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[05:38.800 --> 05:43.680]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic

[08:33.040 --> 08:39.520]  controlled cities with tanks armored vehicles and troops a open war and civil war is beginning
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.480]  we're going to be breaking that down we are also going to be breaking down the latest economic
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.120]  numbers that are coming out that are extremely serious and an incredibly important article from
[08:49.120 --> 08:57.280]  cnn veterans languish and die on va hospitals secret list a death panel so cnn occasionally
[08:57.280 --> 09:04.080]  even a blind hog can find akern's broken clocks are right uh twice a day this is a very important
[09:04.080 --> 09:08.480]  article that staff sergeant bigs that's a reporter for us brought to my attention this morning we're
[09:08.480 --> 09:16.080]  going to be talking to him later on the broadcast as well about that first off though the bundy
[09:16.080 --> 09:21.200]  situation in southern nevada is a lot bigger than clive and bundy it's a lot bigger than alex
[09:21.200 --> 09:28.080]  jones it's a lot bigger than libertarian ideas or christian ideas or ideas of freedom it's about
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.520]  the feds coming out there and pointing guns at people having snipers tasering people using attack
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.720]  dogs on folks and saying there's no free speech in the county but in two tiny boxes in the middle
[09:38.720 --> 09:46.000]  of the desert little pig pits america saw that tenement square type brutality and thousands
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.520]  of americans showed up over the week over a thousand in one day two saturdays ago our reporters
[09:51.520 --> 09:58.480]  were there live covering it that video has gone viral it's titled uh fed surrendered to american
[09:58.480 --> 10:06.000]  citizens in nevada the story broke locally was put out on the internet at info wars dot com
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  was made an international story by matt drudge at drudge report dot com and that's on record msnbc
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.920]  has attacked that the new york times has attacked that they've all attacked it and pointed that out
[10:15.920 --> 10:20.160]  now remember what they did with ran paul when he was running for senate and about to win
[10:20.800 --> 10:25.360]  republicans had tried to beat him he won the nomination the democrats then dressed up like
[10:25.360 --> 10:32.480]  hayseeds went out and said racist things saying they supported ran paul we did the google search on
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.720]  the images you can do that now with faces they just come out at the time four years ago and documented
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.640]  then i'm going to clavin bundy that indeed it was democratic operative we broke that again
[10:44.320 --> 10:49.600]  the new york times got caught today photoshopping russian soldiers in to say that russians were
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.400]  fighting the ukrainian troops they've had to retract that today info wars dot com broke that
[10:55.760 --> 11:01.680]  so my point is they are deceivers now clavin bundy when i read his quotes of the new york times
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.520]  i'm going to read the quote because there's no video or audio and a lot of times they twist things
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.280]  or take them out of context i knew what he was going to say when i called him i called him this
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.680]  morning and i said what do you mean by your statement talking about black folks that they
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.320]  abort their young children and they quote put their young men in jail because they never learned
[11:18.320 --> 11:23.280]  how to pick cotton and i've often wondered are they better off as slaves picking cotton and
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.240]  having a family life and doing things or they better off under government subsidy they didn't
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.600]  get no more freedom they got less freedom now that's kind of a cruder way of saying what
[11:34.960 --> 11:40.560]  our black guests have said c l bryant former head of the NAACP in garland one of the biggest
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.160]  suburbs of dallas that's basically what reverend children's has said quote they replaced one evil
[11:46.160 --> 11:53.120]  you could see and that which does not kill you only makes you stronger i mean i'm going back
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.320]  around the history books black folks were incredibly strong intellectual and had strong
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.960]  families after slavery and then they had incredibly powerful communities up until
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.000]  they got rid of segregation which i'm not endorsing they owned all their own businesses
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.800]  they were becoming successful people got jealous lbj public letters said they're taking over
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.920]  they're getting up and we got to get them on welfare break up their families now here he
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.320]  is saying they abort their children should i asked clive i said so you don't want to abort
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.280]  the black babies he said no isn't that racist he doesn't want to kill 52 percent of blacks
[12:25.280 --> 12:30.240]  before they're born he's an old country guy out there with a cowboy hat and uses the old
[12:30.240 --> 12:35.920]  fashion technical term anglo negro i've ordered a negro medello before people think it's racist
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.160]  spanish that just means black you use the word homosexual in england they arrest you they say
[12:40.160 --> 12:45.040]  it's a hate word it's a scientific word the point is they've made all these words racist i don't
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.560]  believe cliven bundy's a bigot but we've got him here to respond right now cliven i just read your
[12:50.560 --> 12:55.600]  so-called quote you told me earlier on the phone that's not exactly right cliven you're a man of
[12:55.600 --> 13:00.480]  your word and honorable i believe you're a good man tell me what you really said in this press
[13:00.480 --> 13:06.000]  conference that they've now supposedly dredged up but won't show the video or audio of cliven bundy
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.880]  exclusive responding to this thank you for joining us thank you for having me i'm quite excited about
[13:12.880 --> 13:20.880]  respond really first i want to tell the black community uh that i've gained more respect and
[13:20.880 --> 13:26.960]  more love for you uh the last few weeks than i've ever had and uh i am concerned about the
[13:26.960 --> 13:34.960]  individual uh the individual person each one of you and now this is a statement and put it this way
[13:34.960 --> 13:43.840]  i said i'm wondering i'm wondering if uh you're better off uh the young women are
[13:44.480 --> 13:51.920]  your young women are having abortions and your young men are being thrown in jail and your older
[13:51.920 --> 13:59.200]  women and are setting out on a sidewalk with your children and grandchildren and they don't seem to
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.560]  be happy and what i'm wondering is if are you better off in this type of slavery than you
[14:04.560 --> 14:13.040]  were when you was home uh with your family unit uh with your gardens with your chickens with your
[14:14.160 --> 14:21.360]  men working and your uh family life are you are you better off now or are you were you better
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.360]  off live i'm wondering these things well the reason i knew when i first called you and didn't
[14:27.360 --> 14:30.400]  put words in your mouth i said what does this statement mean you said well first off it's a
[14:30.400 --> 14:37.120]  little out of context but you said that they've traded a new form of slavery for an old form
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.640]  of slavery and the reason i knew what you'd say is that's a libertarian conservative refrain that
[14:42.640 --> 14:48.000]  i've heard from every libertarian and conservative black leader i've had on this show so i knew what
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.440]  you were saying immediately but then i didn't i called up and got you to tell me what you thought
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.360]  and sure enough it's exactly what i thought what do you think of the new york times trying to take
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.880]  this out of context and spend it well i you know i haven't really read that and that i don't know
[15:02.880 --> 15:10.000]  for sure but yeah if they think i'm right uh races they're totally wrong uh and if i think i'm
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.920]  again i'm wondering are they better off under the old system of slavery or are they better off under
[15:15.920 --> 15:22.080]  the uh welfare slavery that they're under now uh you know i'm not saying the one way or the other
[15:22.080 --> 15:28.240]  but i am wondering they did it seems to me like maybe they were happier and maybe they did have
[15:28.240 --> 15:35.040]  better families and their family structure was better and uh so you know that's that's the question
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.640]  in my mind and well undoubtedly there is a question well undoubtedly i'm not endorsing slavery or
[15:40.640 --> 15:45.840]  segregation they were two uh Byzantine feudal systems sharecroppers were in similar systems
[15:45.840 --> 15:55.200]  but undoubtedly the statistics of black communities 20 30s 40s 50s 90 percent uh a legitimacy
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.600]  fathers at home in fact i've seen even harvard's own numbers and princeton's own numbers we've
[15:59.600 --> 16:07.040]  done reports on this lower crime rates than the white community in the 30s and 40s uh and because
[16:07.040 --> 16:10.960]  it was all about they're not going to keep us down we're going to build our own communities we're
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.360]  going to wear suits and ties we're going to go to college we're going to build our own colleges
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.840]  and the suppression actually made them stronger because they knew they were suppressed i mean
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.160]  this is basic warfare information but it's what i say every day but when you don't know you're
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.800]  being suppressed then you absolutely disintegrate and i remember you saying over and over again
[16:28.800 --> 16:34.720]  un un prompted we can pull up the clips that everyone around the world you believe has a good
[16:34.720 --> 16:40.160]  soul and wants freedom uh you said in every country in the world so how is that you're saying
[16:40.160 --> 16:46.000]  everybody worldwide wants freedom uh but you don't like black people and i know black people
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.000]  want freedom and i know that their souls are good individually i know that and uh that's what our
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.400]  constitution was all about is to be able to these people to be able to exercise their their agency
[16:58.960 --> 17:05.280]  be able to feel free be able to speak be able to go and do the things to be able to experiment
[17:05.280 --> 17:11.280]  and and for sure be able to have good families that's what our founding fathers want and i know
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.240]  that's what our heavenly father wants for them for them and for us there's no difference between
[17:16.240 --> 17:22.080]  them and us we're all the same and our our heavenly father loves us the same he gives us
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.840]  the same opportunity and we are the same and so there's no prejudice in my mind at all
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.640]  well what what the controlled media does is they take stuff out of context to demonize folks but
[17:34.640 --> 17:40.560]  here's your first official statement responding to the new york times msnbc cnn without me
[17:40.560 --> 17:46.240]  interrupting make your statement of what you really stand for and and and why you brought
[17:46.240 --> 17:55.520]  this up were you bringing it up as a rhetorical to cause a debate you know why this subject was
[17:55.520 --> 18:05.360]  brought up is we had a party uh gathering here last friday and i invited the ethical groups
[18:05.360 --> 18:09.520]  but there's very few of them come most of the people that come were a lot of them were from
[18:09.520 --> 18:15.360]  the eastern coast a lot of them you know they were basically white people so when i got through a
[18:15.360 --> 18:21.920]  question why aren't you people here and so i expressed sort of some of my feelings here
[18:21.920 --> 18:27.200]  about how it felt about it when they put them you know they made it sound like i was prejudiced i
[18:27.200 --> 18:31.760]  wasn't prejudiced i was actually inviting them to the party and then we're actually going to have
[18:31.760 --> 18:39.040]  another party this this friday camp you know along the virgin river i said my ranch has a
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.800]  swimming pool 30 miles long come and enjoy it and i want these people to come and enjoy it i don't
[18:44.800 --> 18:49.760]  want this white people come and enjoy it i want all races to come and enjoy this public land
[18:49.760 --> 18:59.200]  and see what america's all about it's a land of beautiful and plenty and that's to celebrate that's
[18:59.200 --> 19:04.320]  celebrate our liberties and freedom and not only that let's let the world know that we're not going
[19:04.320 --> 19:11.760]  to let nobody point guns at us again ever again not the united states government for sure cliven if
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.240]  there was a black farmer or ranchers saying kansas having the same thing happened to him now that
[19:16.240 --> 19:22.960]  people came to your aid would you or your family come to a black farmer's aid let me explain something
[19:22.960 --> 19:29.040]  maybe even even closer right now there's a there's a black man right in my fray yard right now
[19:29.680 --> 19:36.400]  in the militia and he has been protecting my family he's been coming to my home eating my
[19:36.400 --> 19:43.920]  eating with me and eat with my family meagland back and forth to my house day and night and
[19:43.920 --> 19:50.640]  i can't see any anything different about him than any of the other boys that's coming in and out
[19:50.640 --> 19:57.280]  of here we love him and respect him the same as we do anyone else i think he feels as comfortable
[19:57.280 --> 20:03.040]  as anybody else but that's that's that's really the way we're supposed to feel about each other
[20:03.040 --> 20:08.800]  and it's example going right here on in my home right now well now we get the rest of the story
[20:08.800 --> 20:13.280]  as paul harvey would say that's what i always point out of the media demonizes the tea party and
[20:13.280 --> 20:17.920]  says no minorities are there even though i go to major libertarian tea party events and there's all
[20:17.920 --> 20:22.240]  sorts of people there black white hispanic you name it but then i talk to black friends of mine
[20:22.240 --> 20:27.120]  they're like i don't want to go to a tea party aren't they racist that's done to keep us apart so i
[20:27.120 --> 20:33.040]  didn't know that you were complaining that you'd invited black groups there and and and other quote
[20:33.040 --> 20:38.400]  minority groups and they weren't there and you were complaining saying man they're on another form
[20:38.400 --> 20:46.240]  of modern slavery replacing one evil with another uh and i had no idea wow and and do you think the
[20:46.240 --> 20:52.080]  new york times knows they're lying on purpose or spinning this i don't know you know we're
[20:52.080 --> 20:58.000]  i'm in front of the media for a lot of hours every day and i sure have never indicated that i was
[20:58.000 --> 21:06.400]  prejudiced and like i said that i i did actually miss the ethnic groups and i asked where are you
[21:06.400 --> 21:13.120]  and uh and i you know in other words why would i ask if i wasn't concerned i want them to be able
[21:13.120 --> 21:19.760]  to enjoy this feeling of freedom and liberty and give them the opportunity to you know what we
[21:19.760 --> 21:25.920]  ought to offer to fly out c l bryant with jacari jackson and josh owens if they want to go out
[21:25.920 --> 21:30.960]  there this weekend of that party so uh you know maybe we should send c l bryant out there and
[21:31.520 --> 21:35.200]  you can get a chance to meet him and talk to him because he makes a lot of the same points that
[21:35.200 --> 21:40.080]  we've replaced one form of slavery with another and that was basically the plan but all of us
[21:40.080 --> 21:44.880]  are going into this cloward and piven bankrupted sharecropper economy that's what this is all
[21:44.880 --> 21:49.120]  about is they want to make us dependent they want to get us off the land they want to run everybody
[21:49.120 --> 21:55.040]  off the land you're the last people standing uh finally uh have you been served with any papers
[21:55.040 --> 22:01.120]  what's coming next well i you know i've told you that uh but uh probably for almost a week now i've
[22:01.120 --> 22:06.800]  had some certified letters uh i have never hoped them i just put them back we got a lot more important
[22:06.800 --> 22:13.280]  things to worry about those legal papers uh but whether i'm served there i don't know nobody's
[22:13.280 --> 22:21.040]  actually been to my porch and served me if anything yet uh now uh first you guys reported
[22:21.040 --> 22:24.960]  they killed two of your proud bulls the blm tonight that a week later they admitted no we killed
[22:24.960 --> 22:29.840]  them said they were dangerous big pools of blood shot them and then we now learned that you found
[22:29.840 --> 22:34.800]  a mass grave of more dead cows that they shot uh and the blm admitted that two days ago
[22:36.080 --> 22:41.520]  they didn't have a court order to kill your cows or destroy your water cisterns or pipes
[22:41.520 --> 22:47.360]  how large was the damage by the federal wrestlers well we're still a testament you know we're so
[22:47.360 --> 22:52.320]  busy trying to take care of this branch duties here we haven't really been able to get out and
[22:52.320 --> 22:57.920]  assess and even find all the mass graves uh what we have done is try to just
[22:57.920 --> 23:04.000]  make uh secure for us give them water and feed enough to get by and so we're still
[23:04.000 --> 23:11.360]  in sort of a getting by type uh mold here not really the mold mold yet so that we there's
[23:11.360 --> 23:17.360]  there's damage and i i have animals that basically are wounded you know they're sick and they're
[23:17.360 --> 23:24.000]  trying to heal and i've got a lot of that type of thing another thing people don't understand is
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.880]  this the desert range here is rocky it's all gravel and rock and when you chase these cattle
[23:30.880 --> 23:38.160]  across those lands for miles on in helicopters and and horses are it wears their hooves off
[23:38.160 --> 23:43.120]  and these these cattle are all sorted so they can't go back to their natural habitat and live
[23:43.120 --> 23:48.240]  because now there was there was huge a war out and they they can't walk on the rocks and the
[23:48.240 --> 23:54.240]  cactus and all the thing like they could in a normal life cycle so if they're they're basically
[23:54.240 --> 23:59.520]  sort of flooded just the same thing the reason why people put the horseshoes on their horses is
[23:59.520 --> 24:06.000]  so their feet don't get sore well the cow it's like a fingernail their cow's fingernail grows
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.760]  and it protects their hoof so they can move around and porridge and and make a living when
[24:11.760 --> 24:16.640]  their fingernail is wore off to the quick they can't they can't work no more they can't travel and
[24:16.640 --> 24:23.120]  this type of problem is going on all right well sir we really appreciate you coming on and giving
[24:23.120 --> 24:28.960]  us the first breaking report on where you really stand and i'm going to read you the quote one
[24:28.960 --> 24:34.320]  more time and tell me what you think of it just to tell me if it's accurate so we can get that to
[24:34.320 --> 24:41.040]  the white house media operations so they can correct themselves msnbc singing and media matters in
[24:41.040 --> 24:48.480]  the new york times uh and it goes on uh here's your quote and in front of that government house
[24:48.480 --> 24:55.280]  that door was usually open and older people and the kids and there's always at least half a dozen
[24:55.280 --> 25:01.520]  people sitting on a porch they didn't have nothing to do speaking of a project you saw in los vegas
[25:01.520 --> 25:06.640]  they abort their young children which i know they're upset you're trying to stop them from killing
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.960]  their kids because you're racist you want blacks not to be dead because you're racist they abort
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.040]  their young children they put their young men in jail they don't like all the blacks being in jail
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.880]  more racism because they never learned how to pick cotton and i've often wondered are they better off
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.760]  the slaves picking cotton and having a family life and doing things or are they better off under
[25:25.760 --> 25:32.640]  government subsidy they didn't get no more freedom they got less freedom and then i said do you mean
[25:32.640 --> 25:36.400]  you know what do you mean by that you said well they got a new form of slavery for old which is the
[25:36.400 --> 25:42.080]  classic statement that i've heard a thousand times literally uh are those quotes accurate because you
[25:42.080 --> 25:48.720]  told me that that that's not exactly what you said no that's not exactly what i've said but i said
[25:48.720 --> 25:56.240]  but you know if you add i'm wondering if this is the what the situation is they're better off and
[25:56.240 --> 26:02.160]  you they would probably be fairly correct but no i didn't say it in that way i said i did say
[26:04.240 --> 26:09.440]  they're aborting the young women are aborting their their babies and the young men are in
[26:09.440 --> 26:16.320]  jail and the older women or children are sitting on the in front of their houses in the sidewalk
[26:16.320 --> 26:24.240]  and i'm talking about government subsidy houses and and our the other picture is when they was
[26:24.240 --> 26:30.800]  back in the south they were they were in the front of their porch as a family unit and they and their
[26:32.160 --> 26:37.440]  they had chickens and gardens to take care of them their men were out working i didn't have
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.400]  say nothing about picking cotton but they were out working and were it seemed to me like their
[26:42.400 --> 26:48.640]  family and unit and their happiness was greater there than it is here in the city and a government
[26:48.640 --> 26:54.720]  subsidy home wow sir i gotta stop you this is bombshell this is bombshell the new york times
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.600]  just got caught with photoshopped russian soldiers attacking people and they had to admit it was
[26:59.600 --> 27:06.560]  photoshopped and fake they had to retract today you're telling me you did not say picking cotton
[27:06.560 --> 27:14.720]  no i did not say picking cotton unbelievable because they that is just amazing uh wow anything
[27:14.720 --> 27:21.360]  else from those quotes that's inaccurate well the main thing is i the family unit thing you know
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.560]  what i'm talking about they were happy as a family then and they're a family out in the
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.480]  in these government subsidies or this government welfare or this government slavery however you
[27:32.480 --> 27:38.880]  want to put it those people don't seem to be happy well they're not as strong as they were and nobody
[27:38.880 --> 27:44.720]  is we're being literally domesticated well cliven bundy uh would you like the new york times to
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.400]  retract then and and and take your actual statements that we have audio of live and uh correct their
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.080]  story i would appreciate that i think they should do that and basically they make it array a racist
[27:56.080 --> 28:01.200]  type thing because i'm not racist you i've explained that to you and uh and like i said right i'll
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.000]  repeat that i could probably go right out of this room right now and find that black man giving
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.720]  that having given a statement here within a few minutes to be but anyway he's been in and out of
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.080]  my home i have no there's no difference to him and anybody else and i think he feels welcome as
[28:16.080 --> 28:20.800]  anybody else well absolutely you know i know you've got other interview to do but if you'd like us to
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.960]  call back in an hour or so and get you know his name and information i should do that and i'll have
[28:24.960 --> 28:30.720]  him see if i can get find him here and uh he could make a statement to you that would be good
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.720]  absolutely i'll call your wife back mrs bundy uh and uh we will get him on anytime he wants to
[28:36.720 --> 28:41.840]  in the next two hours sir okay hey thank you god bless you mr bundy you bet bye bye thank you
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.840]  i knew what i was going to get when i called him i said what does this mean he goes i didn't really
[28:45.840 --> 28:52.960]  say all that that's wrong i meant it's one able for another government slavery because that's all
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.520]  conservatives ever talk about i mean it's just i've heard it literally a thousand times from black
[28:57.520 --> 29:04.240]  conservatives on this show but again that's how they do it and they go find uh you know a rural
[29:04.960 --> 29:09.760]  hay seed who might have been from a hundred years ago just straight shoot you i mean all he
[29:09.760 --> 29:16.160]  talks about is everybody's got good souls on the whole earth and it's all love and i can just hear
[29:16.160 --> 29:22.640]  him and where are the minorities here we need them here but you know they're in government slavery
[29:22.640 --> 29:33.200]  that turns into racism i'm telling you it's unbelievable how they spend everything ladies
[29:33.200 --> 29:38.320]  and gentlemen they know what they're doing and then when you're truthful they take it and spin it
[29:38.320 --> 29:44.720]  we're going to be back with what could turn into regional war you name it but how dare clavin bundy
[29:44.720 --> 29:50.480]  he should want to kill every black baby out there then he'd be liberal i'm daring we're on the march
[29:50.480 --> 29:55.840]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[30:26.960 --> 30:31.760]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than ever to realize that we

[33:31.360 --> 33:37.200]  us but always enjoy having him on with us and also when he co-host he reports for us from london
[33:37.920 --> 33:45.200]  i hired watson when he was uh 19 years old i was at 18 years old and now he's 30

[33:52.080 --> 33:57.120]  in the baby carriage but uh he joins us from london to talk about some really serious issues
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.040]  in a moment but i'm gonna ask watson right now as soon as you're done with us watson
[34:01.040 --> 34:05.840]  we're gonna grab that cliven bundy interview we just did edit it down for time to just you know
[34:05.840 --> 34:10.240]  his main statements maybe about 10 minutes has had him on about 20 and get it up to info wars
[34:10.240 --> 34:16.800]  dot com because we got a drugs report dot com uh you can see us president bowels the japanese robot
[34:17.520 --> 34:20.560]  or at least it's bowing to the japanese or that's customary he's not bowing to every
[34:21.120 --> 34:27.680]  saudi prince he finds or the queen of england but new york times bundy and the negro slavery
[34:27.680 --> 34:33.680]  better than welfare uh and bundy has now denied that there's no audio or video of him saying it
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.400]  he says he did not say picking cotton and that it was taken out of context he was he was making the
[34:38.400 --> 34:45.040]  point that it's a new form of slavery so bundy says the new york times uh basically uh discredited
[34:45.040 --> 34:52.800]  him to create racism so the article is a defiant rancher savers the audience that rallied to his
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.240]  side in an attempt to demonize the land rights movement the liberty movement the states rights
[34:58.240 --> 35:04.160]  movement the property rights movement they're going to now guaranteed tonight msnbc cnn they've
[35:04.160 --> 35:09.280]  already begun in the new york times and having them post say oh look the guy alex jones likes and
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.200]  ran paul likes and the senator from nevada likes other than harry reid why they're all the clan
[35:15.200 --> 35:19.200]  i mean that's all they got why you don't like obama carry your races don't turn your guns in your
[35:19.200 --> 35:26.160]  races so we need to get his video out you heard the audio folks your radio listeners now we need
[35:26.160 --> 35:31.200]  to go pull that off the servers we're recording it live just minutes ago and we need to get that to
[35:31.200 --> 35:38.960]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com now you don't need my big long intro and everything
[35:38.960 --> 35:44.640]  just me saying climbing money thanks for joining us and then his statements basically cutting out my
[35:44.640 --> 35:49.280]  babble uh maybe leave it again where i explain i knew what was going to happen when i called him
[35:49.280 --> 35:55.040]  because i've heard this cliche literally over a thousand times from blacks whites everybody
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.040]  that this is a new form of slavery that's what it is that that's what the welfare state is folks
[36:01.040 --> 36:06.640]  is domestication control that's all we talk about here it's called agenda 21 it's pointed at everybody
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.560]  blacks were seen as the most isolated group that that that it was kosher to attack so it was all
[36:14.560 --> 36:20.880]  beta tested on them first as tony brown has said many times on this show want to get him back on
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.200]  that what you see done the black community will be done in your community next so i want to get
[36:25.200 --> 36:33.200]  that video report out right now cliven bundy responds to new york times claims that he's racist
[36:33.200 --> 36:40.880]  or cliven bundy responds to racism claims because it's important it's a lot bigger than cliven
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.760]  bundy and it's a lot bigger than than what's happening out there it's about them painting
[36:45.760 --> 36:53.360]  everything as racist everything rand paul's a racist alex jones is deeply racist and they
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.760]  didn't even show a clip of me on msnbc when they said i'm deeply racist well he influenced the
[36:59.760 --> 37:03.280]  boston bombers and well this is the type of deeply racist thing that we deal with
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.640]  at least with bundy they've got some old-timer statement they can try to twist
[37:10.640 --> 37:15.200]  and that's what they do just like they got caught photo shopping russian troops in
[37:16.320 --> 37:19.680]  and the guy that took the photos the freelance journalist got mad and went public we wrote an
[37:19.680 --> 37:25.360]  article about it kirk never wrote an article about it watson did a video about it in fact i
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.080]  want to get watson's video just added to kurt's article that is very very important
[37:32.400 --> 37:35.760]  we're gonna go to paul watson about the huge ukraine situation in just a moment but
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.920]  it's the same deception tactics you know they said matt drudge the new york times did and others
[37:41.920 --> 37:45.760]  as much articles it was a flood of articles a few weeks ago they said mad drudge has been caught
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.400]  lying yeah he said that you know he's gonna pay the five thousand dollar fine this year for not
[37:52.400 --> 37:57.200]  getting obama care well if you own your own small business you as the employer and anyone that works
[37:57.200 --> 38:02.240]  for you it's five thousand dollars per person that's in the law that's happening and they just said no
[38:02.240 --> 38:09.440]  it's not the fine starts in 2015 for everyone it does for small businesses it starts this year
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.960]  i know i have accountants i'm getting ready to pay the fine because most of my crew doesn't want
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.120]  me to get an insurance they already have their own or they'd rather have a big paycheck and
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.000]  make their own decision i've come in and said should we have company-wide insurance but you're
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.360]  gonna have to pay for part of it you know it's not free and they're like no no no i already
[38:27.360 --> 38:34.240]  have this already have that or i don't want it well doesn't exist folks that there is no
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.600]  five thousand dollar fine the new york times said so there there are no two billion plus
[38:39.600 --> 38:45.280]  bullets there are no armored vehicles there are no black uniforms the tsa is not groping you the
[38:45.280 --> 38:48.480]  state department didn't spend five billion to overthrow ukraine even though they have the state
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.320]  department the deputy head admits they spent five billion we have the video of that
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.760]  you understand what i'm talking about here the new york times caught again ball-faced photo shopping
[39:01.760 --> 39:09.040]  just like aluminum tubes for iraq and yellow cake from niger now before i go back to watson and and

[42:50.480 --> 42:57.280]  extremely grave news ladies and gentlemen because as each new chapter or each new page
[42:57.280 --> 43:03.920]  of the ukraine global crisis unfolds it follows what we predicted it would follow and if cooler
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.920]  minds don't prevail it is going to turn into a larger regional war bare minimum a new cold war
[43:09.920 --> 43:15.360]  that'll bankrupt us further and let the globalist create a new marshal plan that the usual suspects
[43:15.360 --> 43:19.920]  george soros is calling for when they bankrupt europe further they'll blame it on the russia
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.280]  conflict and cutting off russian gas and then get a huge multi trillion dollar banker bailout
[43:25.280 --> 43:32.080]  which they're already calling for it's so predictable to fund their whole operation a few months ago
[43:32.080 --> 43:36.800]  four months ago the ukranians voted across the board in real elections they already had a corrupt
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.680]  government most governments are russian-backed government but it was elected to not join the EU
[43:42.480 --> 43:46.400]  to be gobbled up all hell broke loose when they wouldn't go under the EU dictatorship
[43:47.040 --> 43:54.080]  to be sucked dry assanguated like a giant spider sucking a moth dry and when they wouldn't do that
[43:54.080 --> 44:00.640]  or i like in the EU to under the skin a movie i saw last night really freaked me out and uh
[44:00.640 --> 44:04.720]  with scarlett joe hanson because i just kept thinking this is the new world order this is
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.400]  what they do to our souls one of the most powerful science fiction horror movies i've ever seen
[44:10.400 --> 44:16.240]  stanley cubrick level genius that's all i gotta say i will not see it twice like the road it's as
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.120]  powerful as the road and i cannot see it again haunting is what i would call it and i just kept
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.280]  thinking new world order new world order this is the spirit of the new world order using sexy
[44:25.280 --> 44:30.560]  women to sell their tyranny using sexy culture to sell their evil when you're literally walking
[44:30.560 --> 44:38.640]  into a black lake of soul sucking interdimensional satanism whoever wrote this effect i haven't
[44:38.640 --> 44:44.320]  looked it up and wrote it yet definitely like whoever came up with sauron and the new lord of
[44:44.320 --> 44:50.080]  the rings is dialed into some stuff that's all i'm gonna say these people have seen okay now the
[44:50.080 --> 44:57.200]  point is is that um now they've overthrown it they've lied and said there's giant troop movements
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.680]  that weren't happening shown fake stuff from two years ago of russian jets on the tarmac
[45:02.240 --> 45:06.560]  done all this provocation grabbed 93 of the country and they claim the russians are the ones
[45:06.560 --> 45:10.480]  invading the nation when all they're doing securing their assets not romanticizing the russians
[45:11.360 --> 45:15.840]  and now they're caught again at the new york times this is kurt nemo's article
[45:15.840 --> 45:22.640]  new york times issues back page retraction on russian troops in ukraine photos i mean the
[45:22.640 --> 45:29.760]  headline should be and kurt does a great job the headline should be new york times caught
[45:29.760 --> 45:36.400]  creating fake war propaganda in ukraine just like iraq i mean there's no end now here's why
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.200]  paul watson joins us on this front but also multiple cities how do you pronounce this
[45:42.800 --> 45:48.800]  slaviance has had armored vehicles tanks and troops it's a pro russian mainly russian area
[45:48.800 --> 45:54.000]  slam into the town blowing up buildings we got b-roll of that this is going into a major civil
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.560]  war the russian foreign minister lavarov said yesterday that russians if this kind of stuff
[45:58.560 --> 46:05.120]  happens will respond just like south olsetia and abkhazia and georgia in 2008 we take you now to
[46:05.120 --> 46:11.920]  london with paul watson to give us his take on this this is really deteriorating fast
[46:11.920 --> 46:17.200]  we'll see the russians start pouring in probably it'll end up with a divided ukraine the russians
[46:17.200 --> 46:23.200]  with the east nato with the west bare minimum or if nato decides to fight the russians world war
[46:23.200 --> 46:30.400]  three or is it higher level stage with putin like hitler and stalin to divide poland fast forward
[46:30.400 --> 46:38.240]  divide ukraine what's your gut and intel tell you watson well alex i mean i predicted weeks and
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.280]  months ago that it would end up in this sectarian civil war and that's exactly what's unfolding
[46:43.280 --> 46:49.440]  because that was the brzezinski plan yeah but what's amazing is not only are they allowing that to
[46:49.440 --> 46:54.960]  happen but they're actually escalating it by engaging in in these hoaxes we've seen two
[46:54.960 --> 47:02.080]  giant monumental fabrications in the past two weeks launched basically by the post coup kiev
[47:02.080 --> 47:07.760]  government backed by the obama administration of course last week we saw this fake letter
[47:07.760 --> 47:14.240]  handed out to jews in denetsk telling them that they had to register they had to hand in their
[47:14.240 --> 47:20.480]  passports and quote make a confession of faith that was splashed across the mainstream media
[47:20.480 --> 47:26.480]  liberally of course they were using it to imply that the pro russian forces in eastern ukraine
[47:26.480 --> 47:31.440]  are nazis who want to round up jews and put them in camps when it's actually the other way around
[47:31.440 --> 47:34.800]  just like with the bundy thing they're now supposedly racist because they don't want to abort blacks
[47:34.800 --> 47:42.320]  yes it's exactly the other way around the right sector fascist neo-nazis were put into power they
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.840]  got three top government positions immediately after the kiev coup which itself as you mentioned
[47:47.840 --> 47:53.600]  before was backed by billions and billions of dollars of us aid the state department pierre
[47:53.600 --> 48:00.880]  odymar working with the NGOs to fund that uprising in the first place which led to neo-nazis gaining
[48:00.880 --> 48:07.200]  power so they put the neo-nazis into power they armed them and then they accused russia of doing
[48:07.200 --> 48:14.000]  exactly what they've done so after that came out as a hoax the the local rabbi in denets said this
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.880]  is this is complete fabrication the individual who supposedly signed the letter came out and
[48:18.880 --> 48:24.640]  said i never signed this letter they made it up it was a complete fabrication to demonize the pro
[48:24.640 --> 48:30.160]  russian forces when every time you look at them they've got swastikas crossed out they've got
[48:30.160 --> 48:36.320]  anti-fascist signs regalia and it's the it's the neo-nazi right sector that literally where the
[48:36.320 --> 48:42.240]  waffin ss armed bands who were marching around in ukraine with guns and weapons so we had that
[48:42.240 --> 48:47.600]  complete hoax the mainstream media kept reporting it for days after it was already approved by the
[48:47.600 --> 48:54.000]  hoax then they had to retract now we've had this one over the past few days the again the post-kiev
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.240]  government produced this dossier of evidence claiming that russian special forces troops that
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.720]  were active in georgia in 2008 were now active in eastern ukraine so of course making the claim that
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.760]  not only were they influencing that but they were actually directing the anti-government protest
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.920]  attacks on government buildings in eastern ukraine so it turned out that again it was complete
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.520]  fabrication the obama administration took the evidence presented it then the new york times
[49:23.520 --> 49:30.560]  regurgitated it basically they present photos of so-called russian special forces in georgia
[49:30.560 --> 49:37.200]  and then in eastern ukraine six years later one the the russian special forces soldier that is
[49:37.200 --> 49:43.040]  pictured is a completely different guy to the one that was in georgia back in 2008 then they present
[49:43.040 --> 49:48.560]  another individual with a full balaclava face mask on and say look this is the same guy who was in
[49:48.560 --> 49:54.720]  georgia as was in Crimea recently a russian special forces soldier you couldn't tell it was
[49:54.720 --> 50:00.800]  the same guy that his face was completely covered nobody could even tell they later had to backtrack
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.160]  on it after the bbc did an analysis and basically were honest for a change and said there's no
[50:06.160 --> 50:11.440]  evidence that these are the same guys yet this was presented as bombshell evidence by both kiev
[50:11.440 --> 50:17.920]  and the obama administration and then dutifully regurgitated by the new york times turns out
[50:17.920 --> 50:24.320]  it's a hoax of course the original report was on page a1 the retraction is on page nine so again
[50:24.320 --> 50:29.840]  they bury it deep down into the newspaper but again it shows you they're so desperate to escalate
[50:29.840 --> 50:35.600]  even though it threatens literally world war three that they're now engaging in blatant fabrications

[55:25.200 --> 55:36.000]  it ain't me no it's like we're sitting here on the eve of destruction
[55:36.640 --> 55:41.600]  just calmly watching the globalists that run our country try to open up Syria with al-qaeda
[55:41.600 --> 55:46.400]  try to start a war with russia you got lavarov saying if you continue to attack russian held
[55:46.400 --> 55:55.680]  areas we're going to attack you and respond like georgia and then today for those that don't know
[55:55.680 --> 56:02.240]  kia military op ukrainian army tanks smash into russian held towns and we've got some of the b-roll
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.880]  that we can show folks up on info wars dot com we do have that b-roll on our video list as well
[56:08.880 --> 56:16.160]  a burning building smoking cars rocket attacks you name it and we'll we'll roll some of that while
[56:16.160 --> 56:23.200]  paul watson is talking paul why do you think the globalists that run the west are this crazed
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.040]  because in their everyday lives they're very craven very cowardly criminals but when it comes to the
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.360]  world destruction they seem to be very bold do you think there's some type of back room deal
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.520]  with pootie poot that he'll get part of ukraine and they'll get the other part because i don't
[56:37.520 --> 56:43.600]  really see that though in the past those types of deals are done i haven't seen any evidence to that
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.920]  effect alex obviously they've they've adopted a new tactic of provocaturing these faux color
[56:49.920 --> 56:56.080]  revolutions around the world and some of them get out of hand as this one has obviously now as you
[56:56.080 --> 57:02.640]  mentioned in slaviciansk they've got ukrainian tanks rolling in they've shot dead five anti-government
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.880]  protesters and again you know anti-government protesters in Kiev when they're storming buildings
[57:08.880 --> 57:14.160]  that's a good thing when it happens for the pro russian side it's a bad thing you know when they've
[57:14.160 --> 57:20.720]  got fighter jets rolling in armored vehicles artillery if Assad does that in syria that's a
[57:20.720 --> 57:26.240]  bad thing but if the new post coup washington approved Kiev government does it it's a good thing
[57:26.240 --> 57:33.520]  so we're not pro russia we're anti-hypocrisy and i'm sick of hearing this russian propaganda thing
[57:33.520 --> 57:39.040]  every time you turn on cnn russian propaganda russian propaganda as if they couldn't entertain for a
[57:39.040 --> 57:44.880]  second the notion that there's nato propaganda there's eu propaganda there's washington propaganda
[57:44.880 --> 57:50.480]  just the the level of intelligence that they afford to their viewers is so minimal it's a
[57:50.480 --> 57:56.880]  complete insult and we're showing what looks like russian helicopters that the ukrainians have
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.440]  i don't know if those are hinds or floggers or whatever that there's a bunch of them
[58:01.440 --> 58:09.840]  but the point is is that uh those look like hinds uh coming in uh yeah those are ukrainian uh i guess
[58:09.840 --> 58:14.960]  they got from the russians previously i guess for war with the russians i mean this is not a good
[58:14.960 --> 58:19.840]  situation paul but i guess what really matters is the missing malaysian airplane rider because
[58:19.840 --> 58:27.040]  you're about the latest legity gaga she thinks her uterus is possessed that's that's the top story
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.440]  that's what we should all be talking about alex alex iris has been swinging around a wrecking ball
[58:32.960 --> 58:38.480]  because you're about jz he had his pants hanging down around his ankles stay there watson

[58:55.520 --> 59:00.000]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.480]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than
[59:04.480 --> 59:09.760]  even outdoor air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[59:09.760 --> 59:15.120]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand
[59:15.120 --> 59:19.680]  types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six
[59:19.680 --> 59:24.480]  million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics
[59:24.480 --> 59:30.320]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[59:30.320 --> 59:35.200]  that we cannot escape until we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated

[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:29.360]  see he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:46.320]  all right folks paul wantson is with us recapping the ukraine situation i'm going to come back
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:53.120]  get into a bunch of news we haven't hit yet uh and go to your phone calls as i said i have told you
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.520]  this from the beginning because it's publicly known fact it's just i would say that people would
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:05.840]  laugh at me in fact i was rereading a hit piece they did on me was it psychology today or was the
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.720]  new york times i ran across last night and they were making jokes it was like four or five years
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.720]  ago that alex jones thinks the internet is run by darpa and the cia and he also thinks the skies
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.080]  blew at high noon and he also thinks tweety birds tweet and he also thinks fish swim in the ocean
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.320]  and he also thinks plants the carbon dioxide when everyone knows you need to pay y'all gore for that
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.360]  putin the internet is a cia project russia needs greater control
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.160]  i mean there's just so much truth keeps coming out of putin and you know why i'm not saying
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.480]  putin's poverty certainly has problems he knows everybody already knows everything why lie about
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.840]  everything that's another big question paul why do you think the western media the controlled press
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.240]  has turned up the lies in the face of their lives being exposed are they trying to just acclimate us
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:03.600]  in a learned helplessness with a solid array of lies to set the precedent with titration dose
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:09.200]  with social inoculation do we just accept lies as the new ether in which we exist
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.960]  i think it's more simple than that i think it's simply because they think they know they can get
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.160]  away with it i mean for example look at the turkish situation a few weeks ago it came out
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.880]  admittedly that they were planning a false flag attack against their own target territory that
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.320]  they occupy in syria and that's the reason why they banned youtube now the mass of the western
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.400]  mainstream media reported that turkey had banned youtube but only one of them from what i saw which
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:43.040]  was usa today actually told us why they had banned youtube because this false flag revelation
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.400]  top military officials political officials planning that false flag attack was contained in in the
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.680]  youtube video that's why the turkish government banned youtube but because the mainstream media
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.280]  doesn't report the key aspect of a story most people remain completely bewildered about the
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.280]  geopolitical situation as regards turkey and syria so they know that most of the people watching
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.840]  don't have any kind of depth of knowledge about any of these subjects whatsoever so when they do
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.560]  get caught lying they simply don't care they simply go on i mean what happened to the leaked
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.640]  audio tape about the fact that it was ukraine that was behind the snipers in Kiev killing protesters
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.440]  again the victoria newland tape where they were plotting who to install in the puppet government
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.720]  both came out in the media both disappeared within days when they should have been major scandals for
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.240]  weeks so again it's it's this power that they have when they act in unison individually the
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.360]  media is declining they're losing their audience but they all act in unison they get behind major
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.160]  talking points and that's how they're able to hold their influence over the public discourse
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.680]  poll what's your gut i want to come back spend a few minutes with you on this i want you think
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.560]  about this now because we get this type of societal fatigue with all this corruption and evil
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.760]  and the establishment does too they get kind of a blind spot when they're insulated from
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.560]  repercussions and that's how you get world war one world war two i tell you get the big european
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:19.200]  wars between the polian and the and the uk the brett's at the time i see and and not just me all
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.480]  these mainline historians as you know when i say all they're just all over the news are saying looks
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.320]  like a world war looks like what you see before a global meltdown the economy the derivatives the
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:38.240]  debts the social corruption prepare for fireworks and it won't just be with war it'll be with
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.880]  super bugs are now peaking and and societal collapse and debt and and civil wars and just

[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.040]  yesterday and play that in a minute the foreign minister saying that if russian ethnic areas are
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:11.120]  attacked russia will respond quote just like they did in georgia in south ossetia and abkhazia
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.320]  we're going to cue that clip up from yesterday where he put it out in english to warn people
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:24.320]  this is a very serious situation in fact before we get watson's take reporting from london on
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.280]  where he thinks this is all going and can a wider war be stopped which again the globalists want to
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.280]  use as a pretext to get even more banker bailout money to quote stabilize europe in the new marshal
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:43.440]  plan that's the george soros project that's his own words let's go to this clip of the russian
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:49.600]  foreign minister yesterday if we are attacked we would certainly respond if our interest
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:57.760]  uh legitimate interest the interests of russians have been attacked directly like they were in
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:04.480]  south ossetia for example i don't see any other way but to respond in full accordance with international
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.880]  law russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the russian federation the only thing
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.880]  i would like to highlight at this stage is that the russian troops are on the russian territory
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:25.040]  uh the requests for inspections uh under the so-called vienna document of 2011
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:32.880]  and under the treaty of the open sky they all have been granted the inspectors visited the areas
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:40.640]  of deployment of the the troops participating in the training exercises the planes overflight
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:48.880]  uh the uh areas of exercise and no one but who participated in the inspections including the
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:56.800]  americans ucranians and europeans uh ever brought up any fact which would indicate that russia was
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.760]  engaged in some dangerous military activity but lavaros they did bring up photoshopped images of
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:09.360]  russian troops attacking people which they now admit the new york times is fake and they did
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:15.520]  find wmds uh new york times that didn't exist in iraq and they did make up chemical attacks
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.760]  launched by a sod that turned out to be al-qaeda that's now the un even admits that that's now
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:26.000]  official and the turkish government admits it and lavarov they did you know stage attacks on
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.400]  jews that they blamed on russians when everybody knows it's the western ucranians that are nazis
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.840]  not all of them but the large portion and so lavarov i mean you know just shut up
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:46.560]  up obama doesn't lie hillary doesn't lie mccain doesn't lie the ci director doesn't lie obama
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:53.600]  care is free pigs fly now getting serious here russia could attack any minute rolling in with
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.840]  heavy armor that's what they're saying they'll do the question is do they count this city that's
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.680]  mainly russian that was moving to vote to be part of russia see even if russia doesn't want that
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:09.600]  that the eastern part of ukraine even the girl from fifth element uh
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.720]  milo jozovic jozovic i pronounced her name wrong but she's certainly a beautiful lady
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.480]  i'm a big fan for a long time fifth element you name it i've seen her music by the way kevin
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.360]  booth went and shot some video for a production of hers i saw her sing once that was really nice
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.760]  shyed issue the point is she's a lester of ours and she considers herself ukrainian but
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.600]  things wrong is what's happening the russians and sends out watson's articles that whole eastern
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:43.600]  area is going to want to go she's really a fan of watson actually the point is the point is that
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.640]  whole thing i'm jealous watson i'm sorry that whole thing is going to go very very badly
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.400]  and they're going to want to go with the russians they're not going to want to be under the key of
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.360]  ultra right wing so right wing there's national socialist on record they're being persecuted
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.320]  they're being killed they're being beaten up they're being shot and so they're going to respond
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.720]  it's going to cause a civil war the west is going to say it's russia doing it when it's
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:13.520]  natural ethnic religious lines the west being mainly catholic the east being mainly orthodox
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.960]  what does your gut tell you uh is going to happen a b is there a way to stop this in your view watson
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.720]  well first off remember the referendum in Crimea 77 percent voted in favor of becoming part of the
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:32.960]  russian federation according to the EU that was an illegitimate vote which is interesting because
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:40.240]  when the people of france holland and island voted against the EU lisbon treaty the EU simply kept
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:46.160]  having more referendums until they got the answer they wanted so not exactly the authority in
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:53.120]  denouncing votes as illegitimate when they do it as a habit but what's the the danger to me is that
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:00.480]  neocons like and mary slaughter cfr state department are now calling for the us to attack Syria
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:06.240]  as a lesson for putin so they're not happy with just ukraine blowing up now they want to expand
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:12.720]  it even further talking about going into Syria just to teach putin a lesson where i see it going is
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:19.440]  by 2018 they're going to have these missile defense bases these intercepts which of course
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.240]  are offensive stationed in poland and romania the obama administration initially rolled back the
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.880]  previous georgia w bush policy to have them in check of levac here but now they seem to be
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:37.920]  committed to this it could go either way so over the next four years russia has made it very clear
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.960]  numerous top russian politicians made it very clear that they see the installation of those
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.720]  missile bases right on their border as a direct attack and that they will strike back with their
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.560]  missiles so if they're insane crazy enough to go ahead with that project then we know where it's
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.200]  heading because russia has assured that they will strike back so that's that's the real threat in
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:06.080]  the buildup to 2018 if those bases do get the go ahead they're the kind of wavering at the moment
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.480]  but that's that's the flashpoint that's a big flashpoint where russia has said they will not
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.000]  tolerate it so we're going to know by then if it if it explodes into a much bigger conflict
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:25.120]  how do we stop it i think there's hope in the fact that last august september we stopped
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.120]  an attack on syria which seemed imminent because the information we got was that there were a lot
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:37.520]  of dissenting voices within the u.s military so we stopped it then again they normally ignore
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.520]  massive public relations campaigns the popular you know the popular approval of things but
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.840]  if we've got people inside the u.s military that are now starting to wake up to how this imperial
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:56.160]  american adventure is in fact harming america's interest then i think we can be very hopeful
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:03.120]  that cooler heads will prevail especially if we get someone in 2016 that at least rolls some of
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:11.760]  this back to a certain extent for me it's very clear what the establishment's doing they think
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.880]  we're morally bankrupt they think we don't know what planet we're on and for about 50 of the public
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:25.840]  that's true americans are very isolated most of them obviously don't have passports it's sad to see
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:31.280]  how ignorant our country's become but maybe 20 30 percent are very informed very upset from the
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.800]  numbers i've seen and what i see on the street and know what's happening and know it's wrong
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.320]  and it doesn't matter if they have the majority of people not knowing their butt from a hole in the
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.840]  ground or not be able to find their rear end with both hands because a large portion of us and the
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.880]  people that work and are smart and run this country that actually do the work and live in
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.120]  the real world and have street smarts we understand what's happening i mean we're not as immoral as
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:03.440]  they think we are the military knows that we were giving syria to al-qaeda and said no the police
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:09.360]  are waking up that i talked to in fact i criticize police when we see bad examples of them you know
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.440]  on youtube and everywhere but most police i run into are absolutely informed very freaked out and
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.920]  they should be because they're going to be asked to carry out all this evil man i would want to
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:27.120]  be a cop right now i got to tell you sitting on top of a stack of dynamite literally we've got to
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.480]  ask ourselves do we really want to go over the edge and become north korea writ large but the
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.120]  establishment i think is miscalculating and and i think there's something wrong with them
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:44.240]  that they think they can just start some big war so that the e you that's about to collapse can
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:50.400]  stay in place i mean that's what this is really about the e you is collapsing led by ourselves
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:55.600]  and isle forage and others the liberty is spreading all over the world and they want to have a war
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.680]  to cover for goldman sacks and jp morgan and i just it's not going to work because everybody's
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:07.280]  going to know why we're poor everybody's going to know why we're in wars people don't want war with
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.200]  the russians people don't want war with the syrians the russians and syrians haven't done
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.360]  anything people go why are you for the syrians worry about i've never been to syria don't have
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.760]  one drop of syrian blood never been to russia don't have any russian blood but i i don't like to
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:28.080]  attack people for no reason i don't like to see photoshop new york times photos i'm sick of it
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:35.520]  being done in my name paul i think what's interesting in the immediate term alex is
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.080]  there was a good video on this the other day from the casey research group the u.s military
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.720]  are being trained that there will be domestic unrest in the united states over the next two years
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:52.320]  the housing figures that have come out recently show an exact mirror to what they were in 2007
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.200]  so the u.s military are being trained that there's going to be an all probability another economic
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.560]  collapse bigger than the last one and that's what they're getting geared up for which is why now
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.040]  they're trying to characterize any dissent against the federal government as domestic terrorism
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.760]  because they're the people they need to demonize those people in order to train the u.s military
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.720]  to fire upon them but you know every piece of evidence we've seen is that most of them will
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:23.040]  be unwilling to do that we had the 29 palm survey many years ago which said that so that's the
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.760]  immediate concern is domestic unrest we've seen it across europe since 2010 we've seen it in the
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.880]  arab world there's a huge anti-establishment fervor sweeping the globe the globe and the
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.480]  establishment needs to hijack that and route it into their agenda to head it off but it seems that
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.200]  they're increasingly unable to do so that's right and it's important to say we had bad civil unrest
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.600]  that wasn't legitimate and it was like french revolution the military would want to put it down
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:53.680]  the issue is the globalist created the crisis to create the civil unrest to bring in martial law
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.800]  so we can't allow that we we cannot allow the military to occupy thank you so much paul watson

[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:26.080]  join the eu three months ago overthrew it blew up police stations burned vehicles and now the west
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:33.360]  and the cia that works for the globalists not america cia basically sets the policy for the
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:39.760]  media all the anti-gun anti-family stuff that's admittedly them the ugly degenerate art programs
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:48.720]  that's been declassified that's them they are basically launching offensives in different cities
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.400]  of eastern ukraine and latimer putin has warned of consequences
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:03.840]  the sloviansk is the main city right now the offensive is taking place sloviansk
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:10.240]  putin warns of consequences as ukraine steps up offensive president latimer putin warned
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.280]  ukraine against continuing its anti separatist offensive against government troops as they
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:21.760]  killed five rebels and prompted russia's military to begin new drills on the two nations border
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:28.160]  if it's true the current regime and Kiev sent the army against citizens in its country and this
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.040]  is a very serious crime against its own nation putin said today in st. petersburg i will have
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.080]  it will have consequences for the people who make such decisions including relations between our
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.880]  countries we will see how the situation develops and we'll make conclusions based on the reality
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.880]  on the ground and the ukranians are releasing it themselves through through afp ukrainian special
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:55.680]  forces take up positions in the ukrainian city of sloviansk and that was today on this thursday
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.440]  the 24th we'll put that on screen for tv viewers it's a bloomberg article linked on the left hand
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:07.760]  side of drudge report dot com we're also have similar videos and reports of helicopters and tanks
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:15.360]  upon info wars dot com so putin saying it was true it is true and i don't know the russians
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:22.720]  could invade tomorrow my gut tells me they realize that the west is going to stand their ground this
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.360]  time the soros forces are going to stand their ground but the globalists see the big diversion
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.320]  and if russian tanks come into ukraine all hell is going to break loose and and if the west doesn't
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:44.320]  back down the russians last time rolled mobile icbms into georgia and said we have targeted
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:49.280]  nato bases and we'll start firing in one hour and then nato announced they were pulling out
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.560]  i don't know if that's going to happen here this is just insane
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.320]  and again i told you folks that there would be sectarian violence there'd be russians wanting
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.040]  to take over the towns and make it russia that the ukranians would then attack that and then the
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:12.960]  russians would come in and i mean it's going that direction and i know it's important you know that
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:18.240]  the nsa watch everyone in america and and and what our surfing habits are and and give that the
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.840]  fortune 500 i know it's important for uh checkpoints spill in the highways and the tsa to change babies
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.680]  diapers literally check babies diapers there's no video of that up on it full wars dot com but
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:37.280]  this is just madness and we're just sleepwalking over the edge of a cliff here and they're announcing
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.920]  on the news with nato generals i watched yesterday going yeah we're here to send a message to russia
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.560]  that if they do anything we'll militarily attack them and we want to cut off the russian gas as a
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:53.760]  message and make them buy us gas us gas you mean globalist gas and by the way people always say you
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.840]  you don't believe in man-made global warming because you're in texas i bet you're in oil
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:06.080]  i personally don't have any oil stock or oil money i um have that family that were petroleum
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:12.800]  geologist and oil field workers and lease towns and of course most of my family's worked in oil
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.560]  especially grandfathers and stuff like that both my grandfather's worked in oil that was the main
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.960]  job in texas but that's why i know about oil the only money we get from petrochemicals is some
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.440]  little gas wells that my dad gets a piece of family splits it up and they would make more money because
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.560]  if they don't use oil you use gas and the gas industry actually lobbies against oil so you
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:41.120]  would think i would want us gas to be shipped via super tanker gas tanker to europe but that's not
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.800]  what any of this is about uh so if i was just thinking about a lot of people think about it is
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:51.280]  their interest well gas prices are three dollars per british cubic foot or whatever it is british
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:29:00.080]  cubic yard i forget the calculation wow if it goes back up to you know fifteen dollars per mcf i
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:06.880]  think's the term why then we'll get a lot of money go ahead cut off the Russian gas that's not how i
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:12.800]  think cut off all the oil because then i'll get more money and global warming money you know it's
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.960]  just it's just mindless i don't even think what are my interest but the average good old boy out
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.360]  there that's how they think or i go hey they're shutting down coal power plants all over the

[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.760]  mainstream media or boston herald excuse me that's also mainstream media would be saying that it's
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.880]  frankly chilling what the democrats are pushing new york times issues backpage retraction on russia

[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:58.640]  stuff always look like little kids like bad cops usually aren't even evil people they're just like
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:06.240]  cowardly weird little sycophant order takers who'll do whatever they're told and have no humanity
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:16.480]  lots and mention this earlier but exactly like seven years ago 2014 is turning out to be eerily
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:24.160]  similar to 2007 and it goes over the graphs oh yeah and then they're going to say give us unlimited
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.560]  trillions again and banker bailouts again and let us take your part of your pension funds to protect
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:36.080]  them again it's the same story over and over again they're gearing up for that very important article
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:43.040]  and then there's another one by lou rockwell bomb syria for ukraine's sake and marie slaughter
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.840]  demonstrates that you need not scratch a humanitarian intervention as that's what wars are called now
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:53.200]  is peace prize events humanitarian why not give hitler a peace prize then humanitarian intervention
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.400]  is much to uncover a warmongering neoconservative just below the surface and that's what they're
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:04.240]  pushing now is let's go back into syria while we're at it and back al-qaeda that for three and
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:10.880]  almost half years it's like three years four months there's been a western backed destabilization
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:17.200]  mass murder blow up all the churches crucify the priest rape the women eat the hearts i say this
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:23.680]  stuff and it sounds like a lie cannibalism is just rampant by these people because al-qaeda is so
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:30.080]  sickeningly evil and then i'm bad because i'm pointing out al-qaeda works for our criminal
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:37.040]  government sorry though it's in mainstream news now we've normalized the truth yes it was shocking
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.880]  many years ago to point out who al-qaeda really worked for shadow networks in the government call
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:46.560]  it specter call it hydra call it the new world order call it davos call it bill deberg by its real name
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:55.200]  hail hydra and why do you call it hydra because it's got a bunch of heads cut off one to grow in
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:01.680]  its place until you recognize the systems and the modus operandi and the culture
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:09.440]  you know steven awful is just signed a long-term deal at abc news
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.280]  and i was thinking about how they take the former head of newsweek and put them at the
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.760]  white house and then the last head of newsweek and put them back at newsweek and then steven
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.400]  awful is leaves the clinton's are running you know work to media and then most the people now on
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:33.360]  cnn abc news nb most of them if you search their names were top-level political hacks i mean it is
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:39.760]  in essence state-run media but not state-run it's democratic state-run and see republicans
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.800]  had shared-powered played ball with the globalist kind of been the right wing of the new world
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.800]  order takeover no no no they're slated for full elimination now and that's why republicans don't
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.920]  get religion and actually get into trying to save the country you won't just destroy your grand
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.040]  children's future and your children's future in your future you will literally have a one-party
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:07.120]  system run by the kleptocratic democrats and when they get their 30 million illegals legalized and
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:15.120]  then their families legalized it's game over one party ruling class and they will rule an iron fist
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:20.880]  it's all over the news they have databases of everybody it's all over the news that they're
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.240]  tracking everyone in real time remember just a few years ago that didn't exist and i was insane
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:33.440]  believing the government watches and listens to people that was proof by the former clinton advisor
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:40.320]  who writes for psychology today i was rereading that article yesterday and i remember the interview
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:45.680]  i did with the guy and it was all lies he basically took everything i said and then twisted it
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:54.000]  and implied you know basically that i was nuts really am i nuts or are we nuts for letting
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:04.400]  things get this far down the road amazing let me go back to this article i just mentioned here
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:14.160]  Louisiana is coming out with a new system that tracks everything you do in real time
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:20.320]  to put it in databases to predict your pre-crime or to say you're suspicious now under magna
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:26.560]  cartabella rights constitution common law levitical law any common sense ancient law
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.840]  you don't get investigated until you've done something wrong or until they have evidence of it
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.680]  or until you've made statements this is now no we just watch everyone
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:43.280]  right out of east germany and that headline was louisiana creates database of citizens
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.920]  who represent the rest of the state now here's the new article hate crime reporting act a dangerous
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:57.360]  threat to free speech boston herald editorial labels bill a frankly chilling proposition
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:03.440]  and i got to say i saw us say today criticizing some of the stuff that's going on i see a lot
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:10.160]  of good stuff actually yesterday critics of the newly proposed hate crime reporting act of 2014
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:16.160]  have slammed the bill as a dangerous threat to free speech warning that the legislation would
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:21.760]  hand a obscure federal agency a southern property law center group basically chilling powers restrict
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:28.800]  the first amendment introduced earlier this week by senator ed markey the hate crime reporting
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:35.760]  act of 2014 along with its companion bill in the house hr 38 78 would pass the national
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:41.440]  telecommunications and information administration with filing reports on the internet radio and
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:49.840]  television contact that seeks to advocate and encourage acts violent acts and the commission
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:57.760]  of hate crimes crimes of hate remember how they're going to have the fcc visit all media not just
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.600]  radio or tv they claim they have jurisdiction over but they're going to come here because
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.960]  we're on am and fm and we're on broadcast systems but we don't broadcast ourselves so they have no
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:12.160]  jurisdiction well pretty soon they're going to show up and say it's a privilege to be on the air
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:17.440]  we don't care if you're not broadcasting you're going to pay us fees and we're going to review
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.000]  everything you do and tell you what to cover they're now announcing that and that's when I say
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.320]  you're not coming in my office get off and that's when they call the SWAT team
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:34.320]  and it'll be on the news didn't want to pay as fcc fees didn't want to didn't want to let it in
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:39.520]  i mean everybody knows that the fcc commission comes in and makes sure you're not a hate criminal
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.600]  and i'll be like no actually they're only over am fm u hf v hf they're not supposed to be over
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.760]  anything but broadcast they have no jurisdiction over the internet now they're claiming it over

[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.960]  fast as they can and they try this trick of going we're not taking any freedom there's nothing going

[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.880]  know i was thinking i may have been yesterday or the day before that uh you and i believe one of
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:29.520]  your guests uh got into actually naming in particular the names of those who are actually on the human
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:35.920]  level running the show down here the the show of death the illuminati uh agenda implementation
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:43.040]  i wanted to get your opinion on what you might think of it as a possible future strategy to
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:51.040]  actually maybe take a week or five days and kind of center on the actual individuals uh your uh
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:59.280]  sean uh your caller just mentioned the actual uh 13 families and maybe uh go with the exposure of the
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:05.360]  heads of those 13 families and actually name them by name and along with that part of the expose
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.760]  actually added another part that gives all the details on their lifestyle well here's the problem
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:16.960]  i think fritz springmeyer's book that we sell uh bloodlines the illuminati we we brought it back
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.440]  into print has a lot of good info in it i don't agree that it's just 13 families or that those
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:27.920]  families inherently are bad uh but i mean we could try to put out a report maybe the top 50
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:33.920]  families if you watch a devos switzerland meeting or you get a boulderberg list that's that's the

[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:50.880]  the Louisiana law life falls can you explain that to me what's happening they're just creating
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:56.320]  nsa style sub databases where everything's thrown into it and the system says that it'll
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:01.440]  pop up in the computer will say if you're a threat to the state so it's a new form of discrimination
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:06.560]  you know to say that oh you're an enemy of the state and i'm just saying a threat to the state is
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:13.280]  is when this when the congressman is on there or the state rep saying this system will identify
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.400]  threats to the state that's an authoritarian statement it's like when the army manual that
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:25.040]  was in 2010 that got declassified last year said we're preparing reeducation centers for
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:31.120]  political dissidents that's a soviet term when you say enemy of the state or you say
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:38.480]  reeducation centers this is literally out of an authoritarian handbook to say the homeland
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:45.520]  is like out of a dystopic science fiction movie so uh this is the type of bizarre garbage

[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:10.400]  and the headline is cliven bundy responds to new york times racism report and that's the
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:15.280]  name of the video that's also up on youtube that's not actually the name but we're going to change
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:21.440]  it to that we're going to change the name to cliven bundy responds to new york times racism

[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:42.960]  say the new york times took him out of context and he says he didn't mean it as racism to say
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:47.440]  blacks would actually better off under slavery than of this new government system of dependence
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.600]  and that's a classic thing said by black conservatives white conservatives you name it
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.720]  that it's just a new form of slavery we call it into 21 slavery every day we call the inner city
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:01.760]  slavery plantations reservations whatever you want to call them they want to now demonize a whole

[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.400]  new york times that got caught creating fake photo shops of russian troops and the headline has been
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:19.760]  changed it is up on info wars dot com cliven bundy responds to new york times racism report
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:24.720]  and you know i'm realizing right now why i'm so nervous
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:32.240]  today and it's because of the russia situation uh the russians have said that if there's
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:38.000]  predominantly russian ethnic areas of eastern ukraine that if the ukrainian push uh military
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.600]  the occupational government military it is an overthrow government uh western backed by soros
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:48.720]  if they come in and start attacking russians that the russian government will respond that's
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:54.480]  now happening and putin came out and said he warns of consequences as ukraine steps up offensive
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:02.800]  so that's a big deal now we're going to talk to anthony and we're going to talk to alec we're
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.120]  going to talk to andrew we're going to talk to dean we're going to talk to tanner and we're going to

[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:33.040]  governor rick perry some credit he's warning the feds to stay away it's not a dare it's a promise
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:38.880]  from red river land that the feds now want to grab 90 000 acres of texas land including people's
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:46.160]  private property that have the deed it's not a dare it's a promise governor rick perry warns feds
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:50.720]  of her concerns of new land grab in texas the blaze reports perry told fox news
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.040]  it is fewer thousands of acres of land on the texas side of the red river along the border
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:02.720]  between texas and oklahoma officials recently have raised concern that the blm might be looking
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:08.160]  at claiming 90 000 acres of land part of the public domain and rick perry says don't try it
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.360]  let's go ahead now and talk to anthony in florida thanks for calling sir
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:21.200]  hello yes you're on the air welcome okay i i just like to talk about the russia situation
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:27.680]  and i believe that those who run nato and those who are in the state department are a lot of them
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:34.400]  are nothing but workers that are irresponsible profusals who are who care who could care less
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:40.880]  about you know what happened to anyone else and if we get in a nuclear war with with russia it's
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:49.040]  going to be their fault do you think there's any and i'm just thinking about what you just said
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:56.400]  it's so profound do you think that there's any anything to the claims that maybe there's a
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:00.880]  backroom deal at the higher levels above government between globalists that they're going to act like
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:06.400]  it's a war but let russia have half ukraine and then the west has the other half and then they
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:15.840]  use the crisis to demand a quote a marshal plan as a new banker bailout yes i do all right good
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:22.080]  to hear from you anthony good points tanner in texas you're on the air can you hear me yes sir
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:28.960]  okay i want to report uh i live in Lubbock texas i want to report a military helicopter
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:37.280]  specifically chinooks and blackhawks flying overhead at night and uh i live where in Lubbock
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:42.720]  where the old wreath air force base used to be and i can't put two and two together why
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:48.800]  they'd be flying low at night i mean to the point where i can see the uh helicopter pilots
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:53.600]  well they're probably doing drills at the old base so they have new areas to train in which i'm
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.000]  all for what i'm against this training in the middle of big cities that's admittedly to acclimate
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.840]  the public for marshal law as you see all the movies and both fiction non-fiction were being
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:09.920]  conditioned uh to accept all this i would shoot video of it as night vision you know i mean even
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:16.240]  the illuminator uh on a cheap camera will pick them up with their low flying or ambient light
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.000]  will pick them up and i would just put video of it online if you see an urban warfare drill or
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.160]  whatever go out videotape it and give your commentary or if you don't want to put it on
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:29.360]  youtube mail it to us or email it to us and we will put it on the info wars nightly news

[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:27.040]  situation where all the christians are being uh massacred and such and it's so um ironic that
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:35.280]  most of them are um ethnic armenians that fled the armenian genocide in turkey and now 99 years
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:44.160]  later on the 99th anniversary which is today the april 24th that the ottoman empire gave the order
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:52.000]  to um go after the uh the elite armenians in government and um public service and they
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.440]  fired them on april 24th well let me let me bring up the the the the armenian genocide
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:02.080]  that our government will not condemn um because they don't want to make turkey mad and what will
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:06.320]  they kill something like a almost a million people or something with some giant number isn't it
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:13.360]  oh yes sir and and and people have to understand then they fled to syria i i know enough of the
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:19.040]  history to know that and they're now being ethnically clenched and even the un had to admit
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:24.720]  this year it was just in the news a month ago that the number one persecuted group is christians
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:32.080]  double any other group worldwide i don't care if you're protestant catholic orthodox it doesn't
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:38.800]  matter what christian you are you are persecuted from india to the middle east across the world
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:45.040]  the world has it out for christians and i remember getting criticized pointing this out years ago
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:49.840]  there is a war on real christians not megachurch glitterbug government agents most of those big
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.320]  megachurches are called clarsie response teams on fema payroll folks especially a lot of the big
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:17:00.400]  ones in austin and i'm getting ready to expose but the whole point is uh i'm gonna do undercover
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:04.480]  stuff i'm letting people know up front i always tell the enemy i'm coming but the whole point is
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:12.960]  that what you're saying is so important and the people running our government are backing al qaeda
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:18.800]  on record it was in mainstream news yesterday to murder christians all over the middle east
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:24.160]  and attack our own troops in iraq it is outrageous but then you understand the criminal groups
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:29.520]  above our government they want to keep the wars going so god bless you appreciate your call alex
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:37.360]  it is outrageous what's going on outrageous and they just lined up those armenians and just
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:42.080]  shot them and i'm not against turks you know every time you you know you say this genocide's wrong
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:48.000]  or that genocide's wrong well why are you against turks or why are you against you know ukrainians
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:55.040]  because you don't want to war in ukraine i'm not folks when the ottoman empire and the turks were
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:59.840]  very vicious at that time i don't blame the turkish people for what happened there but i do blame
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:05.600]  their government so you don't have to then own that and and say it's good because you're turkish
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:10.560]  you can say it was wrong and apologize for it bare minimum uh let's go ahead and talk to dean
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:16.800]  in canada dean you're on the air thanks for holding okay thank you i just wanted to go over uh the
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:23.200]  importance of words and how a lot of people are twisting words taking one meaning and making it
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:31.440]  into a completely different meaning uh the the words i was going to go over is everything from
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:36.400]  you know a peacekeeper if somebody goes to war you know kind of like orwellian doublespeak
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:42.080]  or you have somebody that uh takes over a word makes love hate hate war i mean uh
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:48.320]  love to hate it and peace to war and everything else and uh just the importance of people
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.920]  understanding the actual meanings of the words people have to understand that words are being
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:58.960]  changed words are being manipulated and now under political correctness they're saying don't say bossy
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:03.920]  folks go that sounds ridiculous and say don't be bossy it's meant to be over the top
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:09.520]  they're meant to tell you hey don't say anything keep your mouth shut and only repeat what we say is
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:16.720]  kosher yeah that's correct they'll say things like i'm informed which means that you're just parroting
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:24.560]  what you were told or it'll mean i don't have to listen to you i'm informed exactly what are some
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:32.240]  other examples manically you've noticed uh like the ukrainian situation uh with the of course the
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:37.440]  freedom fighters and now the militants we have the militants in there now where we used to have
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:42.240]  the freedom fighters do the exact same thing exactly although and more when the western
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:46.480]  ukrainian white supremacists are blowing up police stations it's freedom fighting exactly
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:52.880]  and then when the russians defend themselves is terrorism that's you're exactly right see
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:56.800]  that's a great caller i hate hanging up on him but i said one minute each great points we should do a

[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:22.960]  joining us right now from the bundy ranch in southern nevada the interview we did at the
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:30.080]  start of the broadcast an hour and a half ago with clive and bundy is now up on info wars.com
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:35.680]  the video and the audio headline clive and buddy responds to new york times racism report
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:40.160]  nevada cattle rancher clive and buddy responds to claims made by the new york times that he is a
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:45.520]  racist and of course anyone that doesn't like the government's racist now and of course they're in
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:50.240]  there listening to hundreds of speeches he gave where he does the cliched statement i've heard
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:56.640]  from black leaders white leaders mainly conservatives that one evil was traded out
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:02.400]  for another slavery and then another evil of segregation but that at least had pressure on
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:07.520]  people so it made them stronger now the nanny state all the statistics show is a new more insidious
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:11.840]  form of slavery and i asked bundy if that's what he meant he said yeah that's what i'm saying that's
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.800]  why i say everybody's got a good soul everybody's welcome here i was complaining he said that no
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:23.120]  one who's a quote you know ethnic minority you know hardly anybody was here people need to get out
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:28.880]  here but i was pointing out how governments enslave people now you know we say that every day
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:33.520]  and they don't run with that but he is kind of a fossil too seven generation middle of the desert
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.880]  you know it was the it was the negro leagues was the name of it back in the 20s 30s and 40s then
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:43.920]  you're supposed to say colored then african-american you know i just say black folks or white folks
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:49.120]  are just people but this is the obsession with words and they're using that to make a big deal
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:55.280]  out of it let me tell you that's how old people talk uh and i mean really old people my grandparents
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:26:00.480]  didn't talk like that but i've known a lot of old people do uh and the issue is is nothing to do with
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:05.280]  the land rights or the people walking towards the guns or the feds tasering people that's the issue
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:11.440]  but the controlled white house run media is going completely crazy i see clavin bundy saying you know
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:17.680]  they abort their young children they put their young men in jail so if he was for Planned Parenthood
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:22.080]  and the real racist Margaret Sanger who wanted to kill all the blacks 52 percent aborted that would
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:28.160]  be good now we're joined by a fellow that's on a security detail the bundy ranch at jason bullock
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.800]  who just so happens to be an american who has more melanin in his skin than i do is black
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:36.960]  and i wanted i don't know what he's gonna say we're getting him on what is your take on this new
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:43.040]  controversy uh and where do you think this is all going and have you caught cliven wearing any
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:52.560]  white hood sir i've never seen uh mr bundy wear a white hood at all i can assure you that uh
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:27:00.560]  this man is not racist he's the he's the nicest most kindhearted man that i've met and it's an
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:05.760]  honor to be on his personal security detail you know he's let me meet his family he's let me secure
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:11.680]  his family you know if he was racist i'm pretty sure you wouldn't have a black guy you know in
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:18.880]  his house on his property 24 7 you know it's it's just to meet his way of demonizing and they've
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:27.600]  been doing that since the beginning what they always do uh describe were you there when he
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:35.360]  gave his full speech that he says they're taking out a context uh i was not there so i can't really
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:40.720]  uh give any input on that but i have heard i have heard that uh that was what happened they came
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.720]  and got me this morning they were like yeah they're trying to make mr bundy racist so uh we need you
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:50.480]  to come speak to well i mean talk about mr bundy why you came out there what you've seen while you've
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:55.600]  been there well i've actually been here back and forth for about two weeks and i'm staying out here
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:05.200]  for the long haul this time um what i from what i've seen you know what i what i saw was uh was
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:12.240]  the federal government over overreaching overstepping is found um they had rifles pointed at civilians
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:19.120]  i was here during the standoff and uh it was just all that it was it looked like martial law in the
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:27.360]  middle of the desert well bottom line i i hope that uh you know the new york times everybody
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:31.280]  listens to what you have to say but the final equation everyone's so sick of hearing this race
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:36.400]  stuff don't like turning your guns in your races don't like obama carry your racist i mean you watch
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:41.840]  msnbc it's literal race baiting broadcast i don't think this is going to fly like they think they
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:47.600]  want to change the subject off of the tenneman square type stuff by the feds uh onto race and
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:52.480]  division what's your take on that divide and conquer one of the oldest tricks in the book
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:59.120]  um you know and it frankly it's thickens me and that's why i'm out here that's why i decided to
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:04.320]  come out here in the first place because i'm sick of the powers that be stepping on a little man
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:09.600]  black white yellow green i don't hear it well exactly exactly and and let's be honest racism
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:15.840]  isn't as bad as it used to be but racial fear and division is worse than it's ever been as
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:21.360]  clarence thomas said a month a month ago because of the control press raising the issue the way to
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:27.120]  end it is to invite everybody and anybody who loves liberty that's what makes us brothers
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:33.920]  into the liberty movement i've caught so many feds online and in person spout and racial stuff
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:39.600]  at events to create division and we can't let them do that liberty is a big tent we've got to
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:44.080]  come together i want to spend a few more minutes with you and talk about a strategy to defeat harry

[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.080]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:35.760]  important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the true media the

[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:26.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:33.840]  as everyone knows i'm not a republican or a democrat
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:44.080]  the republicans get back into office and then become tyrants i will pivot over to trying to
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:52.240]  defeat the rhinos but i am a libertarian i am a constitutionalist i'm pro-gun i'm pro-life so
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:58.320]  i've always been put in the republican camp and i was attacked by the left the entire time that i
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:05.360]  was criticizing the patriot act and george w bush there isn't a war isn't torture isn't evil they
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:10.800]  don't like they are the dominant party the republicans play the part of kind of the
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:15.680]  loyal opposition placeholder but there's a libertarian constitutional movement
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.560]  to take it back ron paul and myself and others started the real tea party eight years ago
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:29.120]  really the election before last i guess longer then it got big right before obama got elected and
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:33.600]  then after and the media made it partisan the tea party used to go out and confront republicans
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:39.200]  and democrats that's what we want that's why you have the republican and democratic leadership
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:46.240]  with the wagon circle with the big republican donors this is no secret it's on record attacking
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:53.120]  the real tea party right now you've got carl roves been doing it because that's it for their
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:58.880]  takeover if we do this but i'll tell you harry reid is the leader of the senate he's the third most
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:06.480]  important person in the country when it comes to government and he's dirty dirty harry he's got a lot
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:13.360]  of dirt on him on campaign finance and his kids getting business deals for things he votes on
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:19.280]  and finally it's being asked about the chinese deal and the land grabs that was in the news two years
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:24.080]  ago when it first broke they're trying to act like none of it's even real now because it's not his
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:28.960]  ranch where the main stuff goes in they want his ranch as a set aside and say it in the documents
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:34.080]  we're going back to our guest here in the near calls but now it's finally up there fire harry
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:39.120]  reid becomes rallying cry heading into 2014 elections exactly what i was talking about he's
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:46.160]  the poster child folks harry reid that's in the washington times how did he become so wealthy
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:53.280]  real clear politics talks about how he had no money when he got into congress and now he's filthy rich
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:59.760]  i mean feinstein went in with like a million bucks some estimates are she's worth 150 mil
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:04.720]  lower estimates 100 mil and then she gives business deals to her husband who makes billions
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:10.480]  since she got in be pretty cool to have a wife that was a senator and gave you billions huh
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.560]  so how do they counter the fact that the establishment's in trouble well you race
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:20.160]  bait you don't like obama carry your races don't want to turn your guns in your racist
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:24.720]  and then you can go around and get honest people to say i think it's terrible blacks are a new
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:29.440]  form of slavery or they'd be better off being back you know picking cotton that sounds like
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:34.800]  something every old hillbilly i've known would say talking bad about how the black community's
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:39.360]  been wrecked by the new form of slavery not endorsing it i mean how many black leaders do
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:45.360]  i have on their libertarians or christians or conservatives who say pretty much what bundy said
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:48.400]  i bet if we get uh
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:54.640]  who's the reverend on from new york it'll pop in my head a minute we have one all the time i
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:37:00.640]  had one of those moments or no not children's he's in atlanta and then i had the n double acp
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:04.400]  former leader from up in dallas on he said this basically is very similar things but
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:11.600]  said it's smarter a lot smarter like they replace one evil with a new evil um the guy that calls
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:22.320]  obama a long-legged mac daddy he's in harlem we'll move on otlum otlum that's what god says
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:27.280]  it's and then now i'm having one of those moments if you just go to otlum he's right there otlum
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:33.120]  worldwide the point is he would say all these same things but i love how children's you know
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.720]  when others expose abortion but then they don't get called racist for not wanting to abort black
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:44.000]  people but then pastor pastor david manning yes that's the name but then bundy's saying they're
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.560]  aborting all their kids this is terrible hidden slavery better than killing your kids and they
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:54.320]  turn on into racism she'll go into a black member of the militia an american who has the same mind
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:58.960]  as i do the same the same love of liberty so i don't look at what color he is jason bullock we got
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:04.560]  some photos of him uh out there with the security detail we'll put up on screen closing comments on
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:10.080]  what i just said do you agree do you disagree what do you have to say on that front sir our first
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:15.840]  i have to say that i'm not associated with the militia i'm an individual patriot okay well i want
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:21.360]  to uh same thing i mean every man until you're like 48s in the militia so i'm in the militia
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:25.520]  second amendment's the militia so you're an individual patriot how else would you describe
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:32.640]  yourself um i'm an american i was born here i was raised here i don't call myself african-american
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:39.360]  i've never been to africa so so what do you think of the statements i just made uh in relation i mean
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:44.560]  you agree with them disagree you want to augment them want to subtract from them well i i agree with
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:50.400]  what you're saying and um that people have just become so used to taking things out of context
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:56.000]  and all for the sake of political correctness and it's it's really that's one of the ways they're
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.840]  destroying this nation and it needs to stop well that's why we're all here well they're scared of
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.240]  a thousand people marching up against feds with the guns aimed at them the feds saying we're
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:10.000]  going to shoot you and the feds having to back down so what did you expect of course it was
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.720]  going to be racism and bundy got asked questions about why aren't there any minorities here and he
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:19.200]  said i've invited them i wish they were here and and then he went into a whole spiel about the new
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:23.920]  slavery do you want to apologize for being racist against black people because you don't want to
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:28.800]  abort them all or or or do you support the liberals who aren't racist who want to kill basically all
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:40.640]  black people um i i really can't say what's going on and actually i have to go right now i um have
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:46.400]  some some uh folks in the juice of this detail okay good well i was being sarcastic so you know
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:50.000]  i'm saying margaret sanger and those folks in the real races how long are you going to be out there

[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:12.560]  that happened when everybody walked across the line yes i was there what in 30 seconds what was
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:20.880]  your take on that epic moment i i almost had a tear of joy all right well listen uh mr bullock thank
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:25.680]  you so much for joining us thank you sir thanks for having me all right there he goes folks i guess
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:30.240]  some people are arriving they gotta go check out what's going on let's go back to your phone calls
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:36.240]  uh look they're gonna have a heyday with this but this race thing is running out of gas and remember
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:43.200]  they had tea party events last year in houston three times where they caught democratic operatives
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:49.920]  from austin dressed up as hay seeds showing racist things to make the tea party look bad it was put
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:56.960]  on the news and then the same thing senator paul when he was had won the nomination as the republican
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.600]  candidate the democrats dressed up and did it just just remember the new york times created
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:08.160]  fake photos in this they're not doing that they're taking on an old rancher but he's not a fossil
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:14.240]  because he lives in the middle of nowhere and and and as an older man he's a fossil because
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:17.840]  his ideas are so old-fashioned that he'll just tell you what he's really thinking
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:23.600]  and then he'll tell you you know what he stands for but they're just it's going to be an infall war
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.520]  race and religious division is what they're going to use and they're never going to stop
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:32.480]  and usually there's not even a grain of complaint there it's whole cloth made up
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:38.960]  usually it is completely made up
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:46.400]  with this they've got a grain because to the condition politically correct
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:51.120]  you know this sounds terrible because they don't understand the position he's coming from
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:54.480]  i've heard things like this so many times in my life i know exactly where it's coming from
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:58.800]  i can tell you that the vast majority of old white people
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:06.080]  a are guilty about things that have gone on this country but b hate to see the degeneration of all
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:11.120]  the culture the young people across the board and bemoan what's happened to the black community
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.920]  in this country who no one can deny is in a disaster zone i mean it's it's being destroyed
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:19.920]  in front of our very eyes and so that's my final comment on that but enough about that
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:24.800]  i just you know wanted to get that fellow on harry reid's long study
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:32.240]  massing of power and wealth that's the big question we should be focusing on
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:37.360]  but it's like when clinton was giving missile secrets to china they would say on seeing any is
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:43.600]  it racist that there's investigations of missile secrets to china i don't know if i tried to give
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:48.000]  missile secrets to somebody i'd be arrested i mean i don't i don't if i gave missile secrets to
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:56.240]  germany would it be okay no it wouldn't be i mean it's just that's all they've got is tribal
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:01.600]  identification and it's how they have been able to divide this country and i'm sick of it all right
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:07.680]  let's go to andrew in california thanks for holding your on the air andrew hey alex how you
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:13.440]  doing can you brother yes i can excellent so i wanted to say that my dad who's in the military
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:19.040]  uh high up in the army confirmed all the fema camp throughout the united states and the fact that
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:24.480]  when there is a national emergency fema takes over not even the executive branch he was saying
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:28.480]  now that's in all the executive orders the republic it's in the emergency centers establishment
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:35.760]  act rex 84 garden plot cable slicer all declassified civilian and make labor camp program yeah and he's
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:40.320]  even saying that's completely just unconstitutional so your dad's currently in the army or just out
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:45.280]  of it tell us what he says no he's currently in the army he's about to retire this year they're
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:50.000]  forcing him to retire tell us what his rank is in specifics of what he said to you describe him
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:57.680]  coming in and saying son the fema camps are real word for word okay um he is a major in the us army
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:04.240]  uh he was deployed in bosnia and then i racked twice and i asked him about you know fema camps
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:09.520]  and he confirmed yes they have them all over the united states but he still kind of thinks they're
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:14.960]  you know they're using a more for emergency i don't know if he's on bar as much as you know we
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:21.040]  would be but he confirmed everything and said they will take over he said they will take over
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:24.880]  period the governor can't do anything about it they take over that's it
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:32.320]  yeah that's the john warner defense authorization act says that for insurrection by the states or
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:37.600]  governors or legislatures now they're going to federalize the national guard sees all infrastructure
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:42.800]  and communications of anybody that doesn't play ball and then it expanded on with obama
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:48.080]  and it's total high treason but to have that takeover they've got to collapse things and blame it
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:53.040]  on something else so you've got to get that intel to your dad so he understands how do you take
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:45:00.320]  america down from within how do you do that you create a chain of crises and that's in the fed
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:05.600]  chairman says i can wait one more comment real quick uh she came out and said that the united
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:11.200]  states will be out of this recession by 2016 we'll be doing well we both know that's a lie
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:16.880]  so they are preparing for the collapse and trying to blame it on either the civil war rush
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:27.520]  this area or china does your dad understand that uh i maybe he you know he saw some pretty intense
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:34.560]  intense stuff in iraq he's kind of like he's got p ptsd uh you know even if he has that
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:40.880]  i wouldn't let military needs to stop accepting that uh just so you get more benefits because
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:45.040]  they're going to take all your rights away with that i've got a lot of family that are multiple
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:52.320]  combat tours i mean one of them like no exaggeration 30 years in the army as a non-commissioned officer
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:56.320]  basically as high as you can get and i asked him i said how many of those were combat tours
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:06.640]  and he said about 20 of them 20 africa mexico middle east asia anti terror stuff nobody's
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:11.680]  ever heard about in dominican republic i mean the stuff he told me is just incredible and and uh
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:16.240]  and he's coming he's if you can call him at 2 a.m to come change your tire and when he's in austin
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.720]  he'll come do it uh because now he's in operations in the mexico i shouldn't even get into it the
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:27.680]  point is is that is that is that they don't deserve to be labeled and demonized just because
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:31.680]  they've been through a lot in fact i've got an article on the vets here and i'm going to have
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:36.800]  sergeant bigs on the nightly news tonight talking about it have you heard about the death panels
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:45.440]  uh for the military even cnn now admits it you haven't heard about that look at their demonizing
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:51.280]  the vets they're making you guys look crazy saying oh you guys just want guns and want to start riots
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:56.080]  you know i'm trying to wake them up as quickly as possible he he kind of knows it's every all the
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:01.440]  unconscionable unconsistential things they're doing so he's pretty aware i just don't know if
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:07.280]  he knows that they're targeting him and his people specifically you know oh and they know who's a good
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:12.240]  man and who's a bad man or who's a good woman who's a bad woman and that's the thing the the
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:17.040]  globalists are not going to leave you alone folks we either defeat them politically or it goes to a
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:22.080]  hard war i appreciate you calling in you ought to get your do you ought to get your dad like in a
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.760]  dark room so you can't you see his face or i'll just go public when he gets out and talk about
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:33.120]  the FEMA camps now now let's let's get into this cnn article a fatal weight veterans languish and die
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:39.200]  welcome to british care uk care a fate the same system we now have a fatal weight i told you obama
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:44.800]  care will be va care for all americans basically veterans languish and die on va hospital secret
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:51.360]  list at least 40 probably 100 000 as they always use a low number veterans die waiting for appointments
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:56.960]  at the phoenix veterans affairs health care system many of them were placed on a secret waiting list
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:01.680]  and they just decide if you're old or they don't think you're worth it or whatever to put you on
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:09.600]  the bioethics eugenics death panel the secret list was part of an elaborate scheme designed by veterans
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:16.560]  affairs managers in phoenix who were trying to hide a 14606 veterans were forced to wait for months
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:21.440]  to see a doctor who under recently retired va doctor and several high-level sources only
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:25.360]  reasonably know is because they were the whistle folks they'll be called terrorists don't worry
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:30.960]  for six months seen as reported on the extent of delays folks it's worse than that than delays
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:37.440]  it's that they choose who to put on these lists and to death panel but they denied but they now
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:42.160]  admit exist for you and your family uh kevin in kentucky you're on the air go ahead thanks for
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:49.360]  holding hi alex yes sir yes i was just kind of wondering how we were going to convince people
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:55.920]  of all of the really in-depth and deep topics you're talking about when all you have to do
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:02.960]  is look into the sky and see the the persistent contrails every day damn near it and you can't
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:08.880]  get people to understand it that's being done on purpose uh well that's because they've been
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:14.160]  incrementally and then they even admit their geoengineering with the stuff added to jet fuel
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:19.600]  at the manufacturing point under the patents and executive orders and and and energy directives
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:24.640]  and then they admit they're using lasers to manipulate the weather and and they're using
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.400]  radio waves and it's in mainstream news but the public doesn't believe it
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:36.480]  exactly and you can see them just ramping it up just like uh what's his name david keith
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:45.600]  admits that they will just gradually ramp it up his words and then uh there are a few different
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:54.560]  debates out on on the internet where the crowd goes i rate at the end of the debates um and
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:01.200]  basically just shut him down and his controlled debates anyway that was just uh really the main
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:06.880]  target kind of makes me mad to go outside and see this happening on a really pretty day and and
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:11.760]  then they just bombard you with it it's like something out of star wars no we're we're living
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:16.800]  in a science fiction movie and then the gmo is getting into the gene pool that's new scientist

[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:07.200]  do something wrong this is the soviet union writ large and i just want folks to remember that and
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:12.160]  understand that that this is what we're dealing with as a society now and that people shouldn't
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:17.200]  take free speech for granted info wars dot com president blinded dot com or that we're on youtube
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:23.280]  or we're on twitter or we're on facebook more and more censorship is happening because the globalist
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:27.200]  are going to end up going to jail if they don't shut us down but the difference is we're just going
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:32.320]  to force their hand we're not compromising we're not backing off we're going to see who wins we're

[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:46.720]  i don't want to do this in half measures and get put in prisoner killed for no reason
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:51.520]  i know we can beat them and i don't mind getting killed or getting put in prisoner set up if we
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:56.640]  end up beating them i'm in it to win it ladies and gentlemen that's what i'm after because these
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:04.480]  people are so bad so manipulative so evil so predatory i went and saw the movie last night
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:09.920]  that was an incredibly good sci-fi horror but i don't want to see it again it was that that that
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:15.760]  that distressing and then that well done shot in scotland with hidden cameras with with real people
[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:21.280]  i knew there was something about under the skin with scarlett joe hanson that really freaked me out
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.960]  a bunch of the movie it turns out was shot with high-def hidden cameras i remember thinking some
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:30.880]  of it looked like hd but really weird it was like it looked like kubrick shot it or something this
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:36.880]  movie really freaked me out uh and uh when the aliens i'll just go ahead and give it away
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:43.120]  so spoiler alert are literally a sanguiating from a dimensional gate most people watch the movie
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:47.120]  won't even get it i could tell it was a jump gate dimension at the start of the movie and also her
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:54.000]  partner suit on it's both and i was thinking about the new world order and hating them the whole time
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:57:00.320]  about how they lure good people and use good people and suck them dry and i literally was so
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:05.200]  upset because i realized the globalists with their technology and their singularity are an alien
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:11.440]  breakaway species of homo sapien sapien and that's ray Kurzweil's own words the even if they weren't
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:16.400]  physically a different species they believe they are and are building a system as if they're a new
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:21.920]  species and many psychiatrists believe that psychopaths are actually a different species of
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:29.120]  human and i don't like these people i smash spiders i don't like spiders just the way they grab bugs
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:34.960]  and spin them up and then bite them and dissolve their juices and then suck them dry basically the
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:42.400]  movie is biological androids collecting humans to feed to a spider and again if you see the movie
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:46.240]  you you won't get that i'm pretty i know what i'm talking about movies like i had the guy that did
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:50.160]  drive on in the latest movie and he said nobody got his movie and i'm not bragging but he said no
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:54.960]  you actually got the movie nicholas reffen he goes you're the first guy to get in the movie
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:59.200]  he was like laughing and couldn't believe it i mean i'm not bragging but i really get movies
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:05.680]  and arc types and you know joseph cambell type stuff but um you know david ike talks about it's
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:10.480]  a spider it's a spider at the center of the web and it's totally cold it's totally evil and likes
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:18.720]  to hurt kids in fact if this movie was grabbing little kids it would be about there i'm telling you
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:26.000]  it's really freaked me out and you it's telling you it's telling you right now it's it's it's evil
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:31.760]  whoever wrote this i haven't even read yet who wrote it who wrote it screenplay based on walter
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:38.960]  cambell and jonathan glazer based on under the skin by michael faber i want faber on i want him
[02:58:38.960 --> 02:58:43.440]  on i bet he's european we're gonna come in to overdrive and take your phone calls i'm not being
[02:58:43.440 --> 02:58:48.640]  paid to plug under the skin i had nightmares last night we'll be right i mean i just it's the enemy
[02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:55.120]  folks it's the enemy a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine west virginia counties

[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:42.560]  took to real life i'm not saying that's real life for the new york time says that i think
[03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:50.800]  interdimensional spiders actually exist is that i hate people that lure innocence and that deceive
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:01:05.680]  them and pray on them and the fact that they enjoy doing it i hate psychopaths that are sadist on
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:09.840]  top of it there's some psychopaths that just don't care about people but a lot of them really enjoy
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:16.240]  hurting innocence and i just want to kill them i mean i'll be quite honest with you i want to get
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:21.440]  in a in a cage with them they get a baseball bat i get one and i want to show them what free humanity
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:26.640]  can do i mean that's what it comes down to i don't like killing people i don't like violence but
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:32.800]  when it comes to them i i i want to extinguish them i want to stomp their head in people that
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:36.880]  attack innocence i want to kill them and i mean that's really what i'm saying that's what it comes
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:43.280]  down to it's that simple and people go oh my god but that's normal ladies and gentlemen that's a
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:50.240]  normal instinct let's go to michael in california thanks for holding her on the air hey alex how
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:57.120]  you doing i'm all right brother um my question is i found when i'm talking with people generally
[03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:03.440]  uh day to day and i'm trying to convince them about realities of the nwo or elite establishment or
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:10.320]  or quote unquote conspiracies if i'm calm and and reasoned and unemotional it's almost like
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:15.200]  it just glazes over them and because you're not intense they don't even listen to you i was about
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:19.760]  to say i didn't do this on purpose to break people out of their trance but the obnoxiousness
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:25.440]  is what gets through the trance we need to be aggressive go ahead yeah well and then alternative
[03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:30.720]  alternatively if i'm loud and directed in their face they listen but they put up an even stronger
[03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:35.920]  wall of denial if they later wake up i don't agree with that go ahead okay i guess i don't okay well
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:40.720]  tell me tell me what works for you what works for you i haven't found anything that that works and
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:46.400]  that's what i'm afraid of that that nobody is being reached well you're in a main mind control
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:51.120]  testing base what do you in los angeles in california no san diego yeah a lot of military
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:03:01.360]  people and definitely one of the main strongholds yeah of the fake conservative groups um you know
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:07.200]  what they'll wake up later a lot of it is they don't feel powerful they can't even balance their
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:10.880]  checkbook or they're wanting to just go on vacation or they're wanting a better looking boyfriend or
[03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:14.560]  girlfriend so they hear you talking about this stuff and they don't think of that as their realm
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:20.400]  they don't know that they're living in the fake tv fake matrix and think that's real and think you're
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:24.160]  telling them about some dirty garage to go clean out they don't know you're saying come out of the
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:29.920]  matrix see the universe be free energize yourself you have no idea what's waiting for you you see
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:35.200]  what i'm saying exactly well god bless your brother good to hear from you brian in missouri
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:42.560]  you're on the air go ahead hey alex um i can really relate to what michael is saying and uh i was
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:47.280]  actually gonna kind of talk about like a christian perspective and how it's really frustrating for me
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:52.240]  to see so many fellow christians in my church and even my family be so naive to the deception
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:56.960]  and i'm just wondering like have you seen over the years like the church community uh
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:02.240]  starts start to wake up more and what's it going to take for the church to become proactive that's
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:07.840]  a very important question most big churches get faith-based initiative money the last eight years
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:14.400]  10 years or so and or they've been approached by the fbi and been knighted into the clergy response
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:20.480]  team infrared subunit and have been told they're now secret agents international security most
[03:04:20.480 --> 03:04:25.920]  doctors have been approached the most psychiatrist most prominent counselors uh had been at least
[03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:30.640]  approached and most of them haven't got into it and then you even get money a lot of times
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:36.640]  to be part of it and so most of your big preachers now i mean if a guy has 600 people in his church
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:41.600]  they've been approached by the fbi they got 5000 you know you can hear do what the government says
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:47.120]  it's of the lord don't try to affect the world just pray to jesus you know take the chip the lord
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:53.440]  is here the lord is here let the state have your children don't go protest abortion you know do what's
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:58.880]  required of you these are government entities these are state-run churches so that's that's the
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:03.440]  answer question we're going to overdrive we're coming back what do you think about the fbi
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:08.640]  saying that there's a terror alert on monday about a potential for good situation the police are
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:13.600]  shoving people shoving alex shoving the crowd here we go folks i'm being assertive whether it's the

[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:47.760]  earlier well i saw a lady that said uh named marieb wanted to give the black perspective
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:51.120]  on what bundy said about you know blacks are such slaves on the new
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:56.160]  plantation will they be better off you know being on the old cotton plantations to paraphrase him
[03:08:56.720 --> 03:09:00.720]  he's responded to said that he meant that it's a new form of slavery not against black folks
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:06.400]  that's a big national news story right now attacking him we've got the his answer to it
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:14.080]  which i think is very measured and well spoken uh at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:18.400]  cliven bundy responds to new york times racism report he was on earlier during the show today
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:24.000]  and it's about to be updated to a full article with harry reid coming out responding oh let's
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:29.040]  get off the subject of china and his son and the companies let's get on to racism
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:35.840]  read calls for leaders to unite in condemnation of cliven bundy's dangerous extremism
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:40.480]  that way when the other senator in the state says land rights is needed he can say you're racist
[03:09:41.520 --> 03:09:45.120]  oh novata senator harry reid released the following statements today
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:50.000]  on racist comments by cliven bundy reported by the new york times
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:56.480]  i used to live in north los vegas and it's home to some of the hardest working people i've ever
[03:09:56.480 --> 03:10:01.840]  met men and women who embody the american dream by working hard every day to build a better life
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:06.000]  of themselves and their families by contrast cliven bundy has spent decades profiting off government
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:11.840]  land while refusing to pay the same fair use fees as his fellow ranchers he had the title before it
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:17.200]  today bundy reveals himself to be a hateful racist but by uh denigrating people who work hard
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:24.240]  and play by the rules while he mooches off the public land also revealed him to be self-hypocrite
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:30.400]  to advance his extreme hateful views he's already called by everybody terrorists want kids that i
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:34.720]  remember that bundy has endangered the lives of innocent women and children this is not a game
[03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:38.720]  it's the height of the responsibility not to not just roll over to you in the communist chinese
[03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:43.680]  for any individual or entity in a position of power influence to glorify romanticize such
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:47.920]  dangerous individual and anyone who has done so should come to their senses and immediately
[03:10:47.920 --> 03:10:54.160]  condemn bundy for their part national republican leaders could help show the united front i guess
[03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:59.760]  this kind of hateful dangerous extremism by public condemning bundy a bottom line will you
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:03.360]  condemn the abortion where he's killing 52 percent of blacks because that's what he talks about no you
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:08.560]  won't the bottom line is that elected officials in those positions of power and influence have
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:13.280]  a responsibility to unite behind the basic principle of margaret sanger who said we must kill the
[03:11:13.280 --> 03:11:17.280]  black weeds oh i'm sorry don't talk about the democrat the bottom line is the elected officials
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:21.920]  and those in positions of power or influence have a responsibility to stop the giant urban
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:26.720]  plantations where young people are being put to be put into giant prisons the largest in the world
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:30.960]  to be injected with deadly vaccines and brain damage beyond imagination that's why i hear he
[03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:36.240]  read want to apologize for being a scumbag eugenics piece of filth on a foreign payroll i'm sorry he
[03:11:36.240 --> 03:11:40.960]  didn't say that i was saying what he really should say the bottom line is that elected officials
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:47.120]  not servants and those in positions of power and influence have a responsibility to unite behind
[03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:51.360]  the basic race baiting social division system where we have the moral high ground and you have to
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:55.520]  always step and fetch everything we say or we call you racist i'm sorry i'm having trouble reading
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:59.920]  what he actually wrote i'm gonna try one more time back to harry reid statement the bottom line
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:06.880]  is it elected officials and those in positions of power let me do it in a harry reid voice
[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:13.040]  okay here it is the bottom line is the elected officials and those in positions of power or
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:20.800]  influence have a responsibility to unite behind the basic principles that we are a country of
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:28.560]  law and that whatever our difference is it is unacceptable for individuals to use violence
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:32.960]  or the threat of violence to advocate their radical views like the globalists are doing in
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:38.080]  syria with al-qaeda and uh in ukraine everywhere else and the violence of the feds aiming their guns
[03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:44.800]  shut up hypocrites scum it doesn't matter if clad bundy is a flying monkey the point is the federal
[03:12:44.800 --> 03:12:48.480]  government's out of control and we're sick at the intimate square and we're sick of you treating
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:52.800]  us like that but it's in pens for free speech got it you little piece of garbage
[03:12:54.800 --> 03:13:01.120]  john in texas thank you for holding sir my fellow salt criminal where are you doing pal

[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:24.720]  outside and kick the crap out of them is at least buy them a beer yeah that does feel like a nice thing
[03:13:24.720 --> 03:13:31.600]  to do larry listen i wanted to talk to you briefly a couple of things hopefully over time but uh
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:36.080]  jimmy savill i wanted to put this jimmy savill guy in the perspective you know i'm i'm of the
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:41.680]  generational like i grew up with this guy and he was a national treasure and to find out what
[03:13:41.680 --> 03:13:47.280]  we've found out about him recently man it's just horrible and i know people in this country don't
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:53.040]  know who he is and i don't really know anyone in the american media that i could compare him to
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:58.960]  it'd be like if walter cronkite or jimmy karson got caught with a secret dungeon of little kids
[03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:05.760]  yeah something like that yeah yeah i mean i can't i can't believe this it's just horrible
[03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:11.440]  horrible horrible um what else did i want to tell you about uh oh god my mind's gone blank
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:15.440]  now i've been sitting here waiting for a while i mean you know he brought a lot of little special
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:20.640]  visitors to the royal family he was the only one with the highest level entrance with no
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:28.640]  security checks to the royal persons wonder why does that creep you out well i actually i i worked
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:33.200]  for the royal family on several occasions i was actually but left to prince charles one night
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:39.920]  and at that particular time in my life it was something i was quite proud of i've since wised up
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:44.160]  and wait i mean if they acted nice when you knew him i want to hear that you know to their credit
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:49.200]  maybe they didn't do stuff with savel that's not been proven it's just very very smelly i mean
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:56.640]  how was prince charles when you were around him um it wasn't a very enjoyable experience to be honest
[03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:03.040]  uh i was his butler and you don't know whether you're allowed to speak or not and i didn't know
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:10.320]  i couldn't see past these big ears if he's wine glasses needed refilled so it was a very uncomfortable
[03:15:10.320 --> 03:15:16.640]  oh my god he does have some radar dish ears man maybe he's part elephant if if you'll grab me a
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:21.200]  thing just i wanted to touch on another another couple of things um last time i spoke to you

[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:52.720]  that they did not vet out and publishing them as if russian troops are in ukraine i'm getting sick
[03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:58.000]  of the inflammatory remarks from the things that we are doing oh no i mean look look look
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:04.400]  the new york times probably did the photo shopping i mean that's what i'm telling you folks is that
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:09.520]  these people are out of control but listen if you're against a war in ukraine you're racist
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:17.200]  exactly no they actually said that two weeks ago they put out fake flyers saying all jews must leave
[03:19:17.200 --> 03:19:22.800]  russian areas when it's the western ukrainians that have the racist on record so how do they
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:28.080]  counter that we'll just say it's the russians why are you supporting racists sir we need to
[03:19:28.080 --> 03:19:32.960]  nuke russia that will fix racism right because that's the answer to all our problems anyway
[03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:38.480]  now i just want to thank you again and i already see it leading to the asian side of things with with
[03:19:38.480 --> 03:19:44.240]  the japanese comments coming from obama centering around the senkaku island so no all that well
[03:19:44.240 --> 03:19:49.200]  if you don't support china attacking japan you're racist because the japanese didn't attack the
[03:19:49.200 --> 03:19:53.200]  chinese during world war two so the chinese think they have a right to attack them and if you're
[03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:59.360]  against that you're racist so just learn how all this works okay learn it do what you're told or
[03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:04.960]  you're called racist
