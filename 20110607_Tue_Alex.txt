[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:31.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome we
[00:31.960 --> 00:39.280]  are live it is Tuesday the 7th day of June 2011 we're going to be live here for the next three
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.760]  hours our frequent guests pops in every month or two Jesse Ventura former Minnesota governor
[00:45.760 --> 00:52.200]  will be joining us coming up at the middle of the next hour and I do plan to take some
[00:52.200 --> 01:00.680]  phone calls for governor Ventura today there is so much news to cover so much to talk about on
[01:00.680 --> 01:08.280]  Wiener gate of course overall that's a diversion and a distraction but it shows how these politicians
[01:08.280 --> 01:13.560]  lie this last week he was saying I was hacked the photos not real then he said well the photo
[01:13.560 --> 01:18.520]  might be me and now yeah I sent it and I sent hundreds of them and of course just a week ago
[01:18.520 --> 01:25.560]  he was saying that Brett Bart was a liar they had that heads up big government calm the Drudge
[01:25.560 --> 01:31.440]  protege who dominates so much of the media now and it was you know trying to go after Brett Bart
[01:31.440 --> 01:37.200]  saying it wasn't true and Wiener's known for targeting people like Glenn Beck and his sponsors
[01:37.200 --> 01:43.680]  and so Brett Bart said if you continue to target me and lie about me and you know say that I ought
[01:43.680 --> 01:47.640]  to get in trouble for lying when I didn't lie I'm gonna release all the other photos I've got
[01:47.640 --> 01:54.720]  and the media spun that like oh it's blackmail no it's not he's saying look buddy stop attacking
[01:54.720 --> 02:00.440]  me and saying I'm a liar I'll release all of the photos Wiener I'll release the photos of your
[02:00.440 --> 02:09.440]  namesake so back off pal Wiener is a very manipulative deceptive person and you've
[02:09.440 --> 02:16.520]  got John Edwards of course caught lying now he's being prosecuted because it is a money
[02:16.520 --> 02:24.880]  laundering situation in election law my issue here is if you're Obama or you're the rest of
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.120]  his cohorts of the Clintons or your Republican establishment people you can get away with murder
[02:30.120 --> 02:36.560]  you can do whatever you want so the media loves the graphics money for a sexual scandal because
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.600]  it's only connected to those two individuals and it doesn't bring up issues of general corruption
[02:42.600 --> 02:51.120]  in the government the overall corruption it's just a sexual issue so it's individualized it's
[02:51.120 --> 02:56.840]  not the open corruption of Obama issuing thousands of waivers to major companies and not by their
[02:56.840 --> 03:02.880]  employees insurance if they give him campaign money you give Obama money pennies on the dollar he
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.960]  then says well you don't have to get in the case of McDonald's billions of dollars in insurance
[03:07.960 --> 03:13.440]  they'd have to pay for over the next decade conservatively so you give me a few million
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.040]  bucks I give you billions and then your competition won't be able to compete you can shut them down
[03:18.040 --> 03:25.440]  and I know I talk about that or at least mention that every day because it's such a open naked in
[03:25.440 --> 03:33.560]  your face no debate about it racketeering unfair trade practices bribery situation openly and
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.360]  it's thousands of these waivers now to major companies and McDonald's and others McDonald's
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.400]  was the first now last year to get the waiver and then their hundreds of thousands of employees
[03:43.400 --> 03:50.360]  are exempt but if I want to go start a hamburger place and in all of this goes through and it's
[03:50.360 --> 03:55.680]  going to go through by the end of the year I'll have to tell people well sorry I would pay you
[03:55.680 --> 04:02.200]  12 bucks an hour or 10 bucks an hour but I want to pay you minimum wage six bucks because I got
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.240]  to take that money and buy the insurance they're like I don't want it or give me my own money I'll
[04:06.240 --> 04:12.040]  get my own insurance sorry I got to do it and of course insurance prices are now going up
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.080]  they're cutting the quality of the care well of course the insurance companies on record
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.560]  brag to the Wall Street Journal they're at lobbyist for the lobby and consortium that the
[04:20.560 --> 04:28.560]  insurance companies and big health care provider systems this will just shut down all their
[04:28.560 --> 04:35.800]  competition and they'll just pass the cost on to you and they wrote the stinking bill didn't
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.840]  matter though their propaganda cores posed as bleeding heart liberal socialist and ran around
[04:41.840 --> 04:45.760]  saying you're a racist and hate black people if you don't go for this health care you're like

[08:27.040 --> 08:33.120]  day of june 2011 we're going to be live here for the next three hours joining us at the bottom of
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.480]  the next hour into the third hour former minnesota governor jesse ventura joins us to talk about his
[08:38.480 --> 08:44.000]  new new york times best-selling book 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read and we'll
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.760]  of course cover a lot of the different news developments that are taking place around the
[08:49.760 --> 08:56.240]  world with ventura always interesting and informative okay here's the deal i want to get
[08:56.240 --> 09:02.880]  into the tsa a little bit more today because well we're getting more numbers out on the tens of
[09:02.880 --> 09:09.520]  billions of dollars that the united states is losing from terrorism and that's not counting
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.920]  people domestically who are cutting way back on their travel and all the numbers show that that's
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.200]  estimated cn reported two years ago because of increased security to be ten billion dollars a
[09:19.200 --> 09:25.360]  year it's a lot more than that with folks from europe who would come here and see the grand canyon
[09:25.360 --> 09:32.560]  or go to florida or go cdc they will not come here because all of the foreigners reportedly get
[09:32.560 --> 09:36.720]  forced to the microwave ovens they get biometrically scanned and many of them get their genitals
[09:36.720 --> 09:42.720]  scrubbed and there's a london telegraph article today cruise passengers tell of seven hours security
[09:42.720 --> 09:50.240]  revenge nightmare they were retina scan thumbprinted made to stand in the hot sun close to 100 degrees
[09:50.240 --> 09:57.200]  for eight hours and we're told it's because you complained about the security and tsa's been on
[09:57.200 --> 10:04.720]  record before going wild on people and and and saying we're punishing you meanwhile the illegal
[10:04.720 --> 10:10.560]  aliens are running around everywhere working at government facilities working at restaurants
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.320]  everywhere and the government every year does two or three staged busted meatpacking plants and
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.640]  arrest a thousand or so people and it even came out in fox news a couple years ago that they didn't
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.760]  take them directly to ice and give them green cards in most cases and release them it's also come
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.200]  out this year a group of sheriffs have gone on record with a board of patrol agents and and said
[10:31.200 --> 10:36.800]  that the feds order the board of patrol to not arrest illegals except for during small quota
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.960]  periods as part of pr stunts and it's come out for many many years of course that sheriffs in
[10:42.960 --> 10:48.960]  Tennessee uh georgia you name it will arrest say a car in one case of 14 illegal aliens with a
[10:48.960 --> 10:55.120]  bunch of marijuana and whiskey drunk drunk driving and the sheriffs holding them and the feds won't
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.840]  come pick them up or i saw a few years ago a houston chronicle article reported hundreds of
[10:59.840 --> 11:07.280]  thousands of illegals in one year released from texas jails and uh it's it's been in texas uh
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.520]  local austin news and i've talked to some of the folks that work down at the courthouse where
[11:11.520 --> 11:18.240]  judges will give illegals five dollar fines for drunk driving so they get a get out of jail
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.760]  free card but if you're a rich european trying to or a wealthy or middle class person trying to come
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.400]  here and spend money you are going to be put to the ringer because just like american citizens
[11:28.400 --> 11:32.880]  are put to the ringer it's about slave training so i want to break down some of that article and
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.640]  there's a american dream story our ridiculous airport security measures killing airline profits
[11:38.640 --> 11:43.040]  they go over some of the numbers of that the tens of billions of dollars uh being lost
[11:43.600 --> 11:51.760]  during the years of 2008 2009 airlines combined lost a 23 billion dollars now remember that
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.320]  going back last year when the tsa situation came to a head and was one of the biggest new
[11:58.320 --> 12:03.920]  stories in the world that the airline lobbies came out and said get rid of the tsa groping and
[12:03.920 --> 12:10.560]  microwave ovens scanners and we saw the national hotel association come out the national tourism
[12:10.560 --> 12:16.400]  associations come out uh the airline pilot unions came out and they said this has got to stop and
[12:16.400 --> 12:21.840]  they said okay we won't grope the genitals of the pilots obviously they're going to fly the airplane
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.240]  i mean you trust them to fly the airplane they don't need to be searched folks because if they
[12:26.240 --> 12:33.120]  want to kill people they can i mean it's asinine we can't trust pilots but we trust these uh tsa
[12:33.120 --> 12:41.600]  people i mean who would take the job who would take the job to want to sit there and grope people
[12:41.600 --> 12:48.720]  all day and to have folks hating you i mean you couldn't pay me 10 million dollars a year
[12:49.600 --> 12:55.360]  to sit there and run my hands over men's genitals i mean you couldn't do it you couldn't pay me 10
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.560]  million dollars to do it to women and i have less aversion to that because i don't like making people
[13:00.560 --> 13:07.280]  do things i don't like forcing myself on people i don't have a desire to put my hands on people i
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.160]  mean it is well i'm i'm starting to rant that that's one of the things i want to get into
[13:13.200 --> 13:16.880]  also the democrats are really starting to turn against omama because he didn't deliver
[13:17.760 --> 13:21.680]  free houses free cars remember all people chanting thank you so much mr president you've
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.160]  been elected now don't have to worry about my tuition or my car or my rent or my home or
[13:26.160 --> 13:32.480]  or oh thank you everything's fine and women standing up and saying please mr president give me a free
[13:32.480 --> 13:38.160]  house and he's like oh we're gonna take care of that for sure i mean they they thought that they
[13:38.160 --> 13:50.720]  were gonna get this big free deal uh and they did not uh get the big free deal so continuing uh
[13:50.720 --> 13:58.080]  here on college campuses obama's not cool anymore yeah i don't let me tell you just six months ago
[13:58.080 --> 14:09.120]  i still saw a lot of obama um bumper stickers and things in austin i mean two years ago three years
[14:09.120 --> 14:16.960]  ago they were everywhere now six months ago not so much now i see almost zero but don't worry they're
[14:16.960 --> 14:21.600]  soon all gonna have their rick perry stickers on their cars i heard a guy sunday night when i was
[14:21.600 --> 14:27.360]  driving on that for doing my own broadcast on 5 90 a.m on the kitty romare show it does weekends
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.520]  over there and i heard democrat for democrat call in and go i like obama i voted for him and he's
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.240]  done what he said he'd do but i gotta tell you i'll vote for perry if he runs and it's because
[14:38.240 --> 14:44.880]  they think perry belongs to them because they live in texas it's like well i was a dallas cowboys fan
[14:44.880 --> 14:53.760]  but now i've moved to seattle so i'm a seahawks fan they associate their personal power with the
[14:53.760 --> 15:01.600]  president who's a teleprompter reading nobody so was george w bush the foreign mega banks
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.440]  openly own both parties except if you talk about a few people like ron paul they own it all they
[15:07.440 --> 15:14.480]  they finance mit romney they're financing obama right now they're financing all the major
[15:14.480 --> 15:20.160]  players newt genrich all of it and meant romney fort was for the bailout newt genrich was for
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.320]  the bailout even though he's not an office but politically promoted it uh glenn beck was for
[15:24.320 --> 15:31.200]  the bailout uh all of these people democrats were for it because when you get down to key issues
[15:31.200 --> 15:37.520]  are doing what the fraudulent hijacker owners of this country they've taken the country over
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.640]  through fraud but they think they own it they will get the lion's share of our tax money if we
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.280]  don't have an awakening to this but the good news is people are waking up to the puppet that is obama
[15:48.080 --> 15:55.200]  and carvel uh the big clint advisor has come out and said that obama is facing serious imminent
[15:55.200 --> 16:01.360]  civil unrest if he doesn't get the economy going well his job is to destroy the economy
[16:01.360 --> 16:05.600]  and vertically integrate it just like bush's was that's that that's in the imf world bank
[16:05.600 --> 16:11.600]  documents it is the policies it's command destruction by these pirates but here's the
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.080]  washington post turning against obama president obama's phony accounting on the auto industry
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.360]  bailout and he goes over the fact that you taxpayers did indeed pay for it and we haven't
[16:21.360 --> 16:28.400]  been paid back of course not and gm publicly used that money to move plants to brazil china and
[16:28.400 --> 16:34.480]  eastern europe billions and billions of that bailout money on record went to that and gm is in
[16:34.480 --> 16:41.200]  the news today i've got that in my stack saying we need to raise a head of gm calls for the federal
[16:41.200 --> 16:48.400]  government to raise gas taxes this is a multinational corporation guy who's bought and paid for and
[16:48.400 --> 16:54.400]  merged with the government that's fascism saying raise gas taxes and what do you see warren buffett
[16:54.400 --> 17:04.480]  bill gates um the current head of the fed ben Bernanke former head of the fed uh allen green span
[17:04.480 --> 17:13.040]  they're all on the news every week on this week on abc and good morning america and cnn saying
[17:13.040 --> 17:18.080]  we need to raise taxes on everybody to fix america because they're all offshore on record
[17:18.640 --> 17:25.200]  and pay almost zero tax it just came out that uh bono of u2 who's been calling to globally raise
[17:25.200 --> 17:33.600]  taxes and who is on the un payroll and is is allowed because he's in the inside club to pay
[17:33.600 --> 17:39.360]  almost zero tax there's bono worth close to a billion dollars saying raise taxes on us
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.040]  schwarzenegger worth over two billion dollars he's close to three billion i saw on forbs always
[17:45.040 --> 17:51.360]  calling to raise our taxes allen green span raise our taxes uh henry polson raise our taxes raise
[17:51.360 --> 17:59.600]  our taxes raise our taxes raise our taxes because the money goes to them most of your tax money
[17:59.600 --> 18:06.240]  doesn't go to the welfare queen doesn't go uh to the to the cop doesn't go to even government
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.320]  it goes to interest on the debt and who gets that interest money the foreign private
[18:10.320 --> 18:15.520]  federal reserve banking cartel and i wish people would get that through their heads when you see
[18:15.520 --> 18:20.800]  the richest people in the world constantly up there saying we've got to help the poor we've
[18:20.800 --> 18:28.720]  got to raise taxes on and on and on and on they are getting the money through the government conduit
[18:28.720 --> 18:34.160]  and that's why general motorist government controlled and partially owned now is there
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.200]  getting your taxpayer money to those private shareholders saying they want to raise your
[18:39.200 --> 18:45.280]  gas taxes to socially force you to buy a smaller car well i'm sorry i've got a wife and three
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.560]  children i'm sorry i've seen the statistics of how dangerous those little ten cans are
[18:50.560 --> 19:01.120]  okay i drive cars that have safe safety records i drive a car that's got a titanium cage in it
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.480]  because i know the number one cause of death until i had about 55 is that automobile parked out
[19:06.480 --> 19:13.600]  there in the parking lot so you better believe i got a titanium cage around me and it's that simple
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.640]  but they don't have those in the little ten cans because it makes them way too much the

[24:34.800 --> 24:42.160]  his lawsuit with the tsa and so much more i also want to get into the fact that they're now saying
[24:42.160 --> 24:50.560]  that it's not the bean sprouts it's not the lettuce it's not the cucumbers it's not the tomatoes
[24:50.560 --> 24:58.960]  well then what is it well we have a history of governments and big agra launching industrial
[24:58.960 --> 25:07.280]  level espionage against their competition and this is a genetically engineered super ecoli
[25:07.280 --> 25:12.000]  and so i want to go back over some of the history of some of the cases where governments and others
[25:12.000 --> 25:22.560]  have been caught doing this now i want to just briefly get into weiner and then i'm going to
[25:22.560 --> 25:29.040]  open the phones up and we don't screen your calls here on this radio show we just ask your name and
[25:29.040 --> 25:34.400]  where you're calling from if you disagree with me and you volunteer that information we will
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.360]  put you to the head of the line and not only do i not screen calls which sometimes i think i should
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.560]  just because some folks are not very articulate or it seems like they call up when they're half
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.400]  asleep and then that doesn't give you know the callers that really have a fire in their belly
[25:48.400 --> 25:56.960]  time to get on air but still i think in the spirit of not screening and really having a free flow
[25:56.960 --> 26:03.600]  of information we don't screen your calls except sometimes when we have a guest on and it's on a
[26:03.600 --> 26:11.120]  particular topic or subject we say please only call on subject but because people are so accustomed
[26:11.120 --> 26:16.960]  to doing whatever they want i could be talking about a mars mission uh with buzz aldrin and people
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.720]  call in and say sorry i want to talk about the nafta super highway but we have buzz aldrin on
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.160]  i don't care we're going to talk about nafta super highway alex and then i just hang up on them
[26:28.160 --> 26:34.160]  uh but uh i do want to hear from everybody out there the toll-free number to join us is 800
[26:34.160 --> 26:43.760]  259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and take a lot of phone calls here on the show if i don't get too caught
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.400]  up in all the news and information look what do you say about weiner overall congressman um
[26:50.400 --> 26:58.720]  um weiner weiner gate scandal is funny and it's it congress is hated and should be with a nine
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.880]  percent approval rating uh america is really starting to wake up and so it's good to see him
[27:02.880 --> 27:09.920]  falling he is a vicious anti-second amendment big government pro socialist health care one
[27:09.920 --> 27:17.200]  world government loving individual he also has demonized because he's a big wall street minion
[27:17.200 --> 27:22.640]  and wall street wages war especially the big brokerage firms and banks against real money
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.600]  and golden silver makes their fiat currency look bad worldwide that they can manipulate and so
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.920]  they're always attacking golden silver and he did that and tried to destroy some of the biggest
[27:31.920 --> 27:39.920]  companies out there and i researched his his um his committee hearings and it was all a bunch
[27:39.920 --> 27:46.880]  of deceptive garbage it was not accurate i mean it would be easy to get up here and say oh i don't
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.640]  like that other talk show host sponsor we've got better deals in gold uh and analyzing and i think
[27:52.640 --> 27:56.960]  might as does but at the same time i think that other companies competitive and offer some really
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.880]  good products and the things that weiner uh was saying about it when i went and researched and i
[28:02.880 --> 28:09.360]  know a lot about the golden silver industry were lies well what do you expect from a guy who has
[28:09.360 --> 28:18.880]  openly said he wants to ban guns i mean he's a tyrant and he's crazy i mean i would never never
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.520]  never send any woman including my wife a photograph of my genitals
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.840]  much less hundreds of photos the scores of women were now learning and here's the issue
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.840]  when do these politicians lie when their lips move bill clinton uh his wife works with hillary
[28:39.840 --> 28:45.280]  this is a big clinton insider you listen here how dare you i did not have sex with that woman
[28:45.280 --> 28:56.640]  monica lawinsky you hear me oh not eleven's an inside job how dare you how dare you ring
[28:56.640 --> 29:01.760]  solow doesn't it we are the same thing how dare you on monica and so this guy a week ago is like

[29:07.360 --> 29:12.480]  after him it's not true i didn't because brett bart knew how to go look at the internet technology
[29:12.480 --> 29:17.520]  and tell that that was his account and look at some of the history and and when he'd been active
[29:17.520 --> 29:24.160]  and say hey i'm calling you on it brett bart really uh he took the bait that his weiner did
[29:24.160 --> 29:28.720]  turns out brett bart had all these other photos and weiner came out and lied and said that he was
[29:28.720 --> 29:35.200]  lying uh and and and now weiner's in deep trouble uh he's having to admit okay i did send the photo
[29:35.200 --> 29:42.240]  i did take it remember before i was hacked it's photoshopped yes yes that's right believe me
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.800]  by the way turn your guns into me because i i want you to be safe it's not that i want to enslave

[33:48.720 --> 33:54.160]  country i really need to start screening the calls to an extent to ask folks how they're calling in
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.880]  we screen the calls to such a uh not exist an extent we don't even really ask what stations
[34:00.880 --> 34:11.920]  people are calling in on i may actually change that and start some bare screening just so we
[34:11.920 --> 34:16.480]  can find out exactly how folks are listening to stations have been asking us to do that for a long
[34:16.480 --> 34:21.520]  time and we really should do that for all the big stations that are picking up the show plus it's
[34:21.520 --> 34:27.040]  fun to hear where people are tuning in from whether it's satellite global shortwave internet or
[34:27.040 --> 34:37.040]  terrestrial am and fm stations very exciting numbers 24 700 plus thousand people listened
[34:38.000 --> 34:43.840]  just over one of our ways that we stream over the internet at shout cast alone in the month of
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.600]  may very very exciting and on our eight youtube channels we're now getting on average about
[34:49.600 --> 35:00.160]  5 million views a week 114 million views on one of the channels alone no brag just fact very exciting
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.920]  but but it also something's happening for years i've been on air 16 years in the last four or
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.600]  five years i have zero butterflies when i get on the radio and that's not a good thing because i
[35:11.600 --> 35:21.120]  tend to really be able to focus and and make more key analytical connections on air when i am frosty
[35:21.120 --> 35:26.240]  and when i do have that feeling of standing up on the edge of a cliff but now i'm having that feeling
[35:26.240 --> 35:30.080]  come back more and more something i really haven't felt intensely for more than a decade
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.640]  because i realized that we are reaching millions and millions and millions and millions of new
[35:36.640 --> 35:43.840]  people every single day and it is quite a responsibility that i have and i am fully
[35:43.840 --> 35:49.920]  aware of that responsibility and the groundbreaking information that we're putting out to a gigantic
[35:49.920 --> 35:56.640]  audience this information even in alternative media on the global population reduction plan
[35:56.640 --> 36:02.160]  was not widespread a decade ago and the fact that we are getting this message out to tens of millions
[36:02.160 --> 36:09.680]  of people is revolutionary make no mistake what is happening here is nothing short of awe inspiring
[36:09.680 --> 36:17.840]  and i just ask god to lead guide and direct me and that i be a worthy vessel to try to expose
[36:17.840 --> 36:21.360]  and fight corruption and i want to thank the listeners for spreading the word about the
[36:21.360 --> 36:29.440]  broadcast and the news websites over the years because you are the absolutely vital key ingredient
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.520]  and component in the explosion of the truth movement which is really a movement to question
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.480]  government corruption to question the mega corporations that are waging war against the
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.920]  free market in a corporate takeover of the planet known as the new world order now finishing up with
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.560]  wiener and then a smattering of some other news i'll get to later if we have time obviously
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.040]  much of it will be covered today but i need to at least mention it so we know we got to it at
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.320]  some level and then we'll go to wilson ed peter don kathy and others that are patiently holding
[37:00.320 --> 37:07.440]  toll free number 800 2599231 the genesis phone system only has six phone lines ours has 100
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.760]  and or more we can put 100 up on the board and we can get 100 calls in in about one minute
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.760]  that's another thing i've been in studio with national shows they'll have like 15 phone lines
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.360]  are like wow you lit up all our lines and i'm like you think lighting up 15 lines is a big deal
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.920]  well in fact someday i'll put a video camera in here and show people the phone system
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.960]  and you can watch a hundred calls come in in less than a minute sometimes it might take three
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.400]  minutes and and we could expand the board to where you could see probably a thousand phone
[37:38.400 --> 37:47.200]  calls again i'm not bragging here but we have to realize that mr madow show excuse me sir madow
[37:47.200 --> 37:57.360]  uh on i mean mrs madow or miss madow whatever its name is on msnbc has less viewers than i've
[37:57.360 --> 38:04.160]  looked at the ratings numbers than maybe 10 of our biggest affiliates i mean we have am radio
[38:04.160 --> 38:10.080]  stations where over the course of a show 150 000 people tune in in big cities
[38:10.080 --> 38:17.120]  i mean these people are a paper tiger they are an illusion we have millions a day over
[38:17.120 --> 38:26.800]  the internet rachel madow or rick madow only on her biggest days has like 500 600 000 same
[38:26.800 --> 38:31.280]  thing with chris matthews but everybody bows down to them and ooh chris mathews is coming
[38:31.280 --> 38:38.000]  to austin to interview you oh my goodness alex you've hit the big time i've hit the big time
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.560]  time somebody that there are morning shows in this country in major cities that have a
[38:44.560 --> 38:50.400]  million people that tune in and and you don't and and to advertise on those shows is a couple
[38:50.400 --> 38:57.040]  hundred bucks a minute but then they have more listeners many big city radio shows than msnbc
[38:57.040 --> 39:04.560]  you know how much msnbc is for a one minute ad during prime time 10 20 30 40 50 000 it's a paper
[39:04.560 --> 39:13.200]  tiger it's a hoax it's an illusion the government is a discredited group of criminals msnbc got
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.640]  government secret bailout and private fellow reserve money your tax money they're a joke
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.400]  and congress ruled back under bush that the buying of news by government is illegal it's
[39:24.400 --> 39:31.120]  illegal it's illegal in florida when bank of america got caught taking a house six months ago
[39:31.120 --> 39:34.800]  well five months ago they were ordered in court to give the money back in the house back
[39:34.800 --> 39:41.920]  that they never had a deed to they never owned that was paid for in cash in a different transaction
[39:41.920 --> 39:47.600]  and finally the court said we're seizing your bank of america branch it's time to recognize
[39:47.600 --> 39:53.280]  how pathetic and weak these people are they want a police state in place because they're losing
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.800]  control and the system knows they've committed legions of crimes and if they don't have martial law
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.400]  law in this country and if they don't put in the internet kill switch and if they don't shut us down
[40:04.400 --> 40:15.040]  they're going to lose 91 of the american people hate the congress the people are awake we just
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.880]  haven't realized that they are awake yet that's the last domino to fall they don't want us to get
[40:20.880 --> 40:27.280]  together and realize that we're winning the info war okay i'm ranting i'm ranting look at the type
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.720]  of news i have before i finish up with wiener and wiener gate or wiener's gate he sent out so many
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.880]  photos british royalty dined on human flesh daily mail well i already knew this and i told you this
[40:38.880 --> 40:44.960]  years ago it's in mainline history books uh they also have their hind ends wiped currently uh by a
[40:44.960 --> 40:50.720]  lord you think i'm joking it's called grim of the stool folks you cannot make this up royalty in
[40:50.720 --> 40:56.320]  europe routinely ate baby flesh women believe that it made them more beautiful to eat babies you know
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.920]  the communist chinese eat aborted babies that was a rumor decades ago now confirmed uh the
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.960]  mobile execution vans were in the foreign press not admitted here till about seven years ago they
[41:06.960 --> 41:13.920]  have 25 mobile execution vans per major city uh again you can't make up how evil government is
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.200]  british royalty died on human flesh they have long been famed for their love of lavish banquets
[41:19.200 --> 41:23.920]  and rich recipes but what is less well known as the british royals also had a taste for human flesh
[41:23.920 --> 41:31.680]  their predators they funded 156 years ago the eugenics movement they openly commissioned
[41:31.680 --> 41:39.840]  the royal institutes uh over there to set up a system to enslave and exterminate the population
[41:39.840 --> 41:45.920]  now hitler that's why the british king edward the eighth was a nazi and that's why he had to step
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.040]  down was because there was a shift against the nazis they founded the belterberg group
[41:51.040 --> 41:59.040]  they are the ones that openly fund in public commissions in england and the us engineering
[41:59.040 --> 42:04.160]  rice and corn to sterilize you by the way i have the documents right here the rockefeller
[42:04.160 --> 42:09.360]  documents 1963 we've written articles with links to their own websites they're proud of this i have
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.920]  the u.s department of agriculture funds just type in the search engine u.s department of agriculture
[42:13.920 --> 42:21.920]  funds corn crops that sterilize you and you will get links to them oh but they wouldn't hurt us
[42:22.480 --> 42:33.920]  i'm sorry let's go back to uh the uh cannibalism the report is revealed as that recently as the
[42:33.920 --> 42:40.240]  18th century uh no this didn't stop uh british royalty swallowed parts of the human body the
[42:40.240 --> 42:44.960]  author adds that this was uh not a practice reserve to monarchs but was widespread among
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.880]  the well-to-do in europe they've always been predators they see you as animals see let me
[42:50.880 --> 42:58.160]  explain how this works okay let me explain how this works if if you're a new listener and you hear
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.240]  me say that dinecore and halliburton have it it's been admitted congressional hearings and major
[43:04.240 --> 43:10.800]  newspapers in the country are running giant white slavery rings including women and children
[43:13.120 --> 43:16.720]  that means sex slavery i always get emails saying well don't you care about black slavery white
[43:16.720 --> 43:23.360]  slavery is sexual slavery it's like white ops black ops it's a name nothing to do with black
[43:23.360 --> 43:26.560]  people people can't even think in this country because of political correctness we don't want
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.000]  socials health care you're a racist you're like what does that do with reality we don't care we're
[43:30.000 --> 43:38.160]  brainwashed idiots side issue let me explain how this works i've been talking about dinecore and
[43:38.160 --> 43:45.200]  halliburton and other globalist defense contractors and the un for 16 years running white slavery
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.880]  worldwide because it's in the bbc it's in the associated press it just doesn't become the big
[43:50.880 --> 43:59.840]  nightly news item so yes i have been driven crazy to a certain extent by knowing this evil's going
[43:59.840 --> 44:10.160]  on knowing that the royals drink blood uh knowing that al gore it came out in major news uh back in
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.680]  99 flies around with a refrigerator full of blood of different blood types that they say well it's
[44:15.680 --> 44:21.360]  in case he gets shot he has blood with him well it's a bunch of different blood types i know that
[44:21.360 --> 44:27.040]  the the royalty has people that wipe their hind ends and it's it's actually on the record but people
[44:27.040 --> 44:33.120]  can't believe reality i know that there is a practice in europe still ongoing and a practice
[44:33.120 --> 44:42.160]  by the communist chinese elites have always eaten man flesh that's why they believe they're the elites
[44:42.160 --> 44:47.920]  if you go back to the aztecs the number one way this is on record mainline anthropology archaeology
[44:48.560 --> 44:54.960]  the main way the priest class that ruled the meso american cultures toll tech others up to the
[44:54.960 --> 45:02.960]  mayan aztec the whole mayan culture the daily sacrifices for sunrise for noon for the sun setting
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.080]  on big holidays they would sacrifice more than 10 000 per sacrificial city i've been to many of them
[45:08.800 --> 45:17.760]  the main way they funded the priest class was the longhams and they would the most highest price
[45:17.760 --> 45:22.480]  was child meat and they would have the daily sacrifices and in the lower priest it would
[45:22.480 --> 45:30.720]  sell beneath the pyramid in the market the human flesh now every culture does this
[45:32.560 --> 45:39.520]  this is what happens and and image it as a centrifuge where where where they spin out the
[45:39.520 --> 45:45.120]  different parts here's the analogy take blood if they put blood in the centrifuge and they spin it
[45:45.120 --> 45:52.640]  it and the heavier plate let's get on the outside and the dead blood cells and then the blood cells
[45:52.640 --> 45:59.120]  and then the plasma that has the white blood cells on on the outside and that's basically what society
[45:59.120 --> 46:05.920]  does throughout history there's always psychopaths on average for every 200 people there's one
[46:05.920 --> 46:10.800]  psychopath for every 25 to 30 depends on what statistic you look at you have a sociopath
[46:10.800 --> 46:18.320]  and the psychopaths always in society want the power want the control want to chain people down
[46:18.320 --> 46:25.200]  and and and and eat them it's what they like they are they are malfunctioning they are mentally
[46:25.200 --> 46:30.800]  ill that there's something wrong with them they're predators against their own their own species
[46:30.800 --> 46:37.520]  okay they always recruit the sociopaths people that just don't care only care about themselves
[46:37.520 --> 46:44.240]  they don't so much enjoy killing people or ripping children's teeth out with pliers
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.280]  or burning people's eyes out with hot pokers or boiling people in oil or crucifying people upside
[46:49.280 --> 46:56.240]  down or murdering entire cities or lining a thousand mile roman road with people burning at the stake
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.560]  but they'll do it if they get the power they just want a big house and you know women
[47:02.560 --> 47:11.360]  and they always get into power in every case and that's why the norm not the exception is
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.920]  torture dungeons mass executions mass raping slavery death and destruction
[47:19.040 --> 47:26.000]  and that's why i call the queen of england a disgusting demon that's why i pull her down
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.760]  we're told she's this sweet old lady she is the progeny of european elite and we don't believe me
[47:33.760 --> 47:41.040]  just just search the term royalty bloodbaths there's a reason they call it blood thirsty
[47:41.040 --> 47:47.200]  all these terms have a root um transylvanian royalty german royalty french royalty dutch
[47:47.200 --> 47:54.160]  royalty and it's a secret uh process they reportedly still engage in but as early as
[47:54.160 --> 48:00.480]  just 60 70 years ago was on record that they would bathe women especially in the blood of children
[48:01.440 --> 48:06.160]  this is one of their favorite things to do and so all elites do this they believe it makes them
[48:06.160 --> 48:12.000]  beautiful and uh they will uh slit the child's throat right there at the bathtub pour it in
[48:12.640 --> 48:17.280]  these women find it beautiful to watch the child's blood spraying out then they get in the blood bath
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.320]  okay now see i don't know i never really even got got far on air i just thought since it's
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.200]  mainstream news right now british royalty dined on human flesh i thought i would just bring that
[48:27.200 --> 48:32.400]  up to you but not so much even the dining on the human flesh they like to split the head open
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.480]  and get the pituitary gland and uh eat it it's the old-fashioned growth hormone you know the rich
[48:38.480 --> 48:45.360]  people today spend millions of dollars getting the scores of uh facelifts and and and botox and uh
[48:45.360 --> 48:52.960]  uh liposuction and blood transfusions and oh yeah but that's for the lower level new orish the
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.640]  british royalty they like to eat the pituitary gland and it goes on the article that it was
[48:58.640 --> 49:06.800]  medical it was so they live longer uh and but they also enjoyed the dishes uh medical cannibalism
[49:06.800 --> 49:12.240]  both queen mary the second or uncle king charles the second both took distilled human skull
[49:12.240 --> 49:22.160]  on their deathbeds in 1698 and 1685 but but again they did this as as or as late as even 100 years
[49:22.160 --> 49:28.320]  after cannibalism was only found in the new world is often believed but also in europe well of course
[49:28.320 --> 49:40.160]  it was found uh in europe as well every culture has psychopaths every culture has decadent people
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.240]  that always want to do something new always want to satiate themselves with something
[49:46.240 --> 49:52.080]  more bizarre more insane more disgusting remember the case in new york with the rolling stones and
[49:52.080 --> 49:56.960]  the black kid sacrifice in a voodoo ritual but so many high-powered people were there that they
[49:56.960 --> 50:04.080]  didn't even get in trouble you think movies like eyes wide shut are fiction no ladies and gentlemen
[50:04.080 --> 50:10.960]  kubrick died after he refused mysteriously died after he refused to cut out 25 minutes of that film
[50:10.960 --> 50:18.000]  he died they cut it and what do you have in that movie the wealthy elite of new york going to a palace
[50:18.640 --> 50:24.960]  mansion and having orgies and human sacrifice well this is what they do i've been to bohemian
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.960]  grove okay i just saw the opening ritual which is a mock human sacrifice which is an outward
[50:30.960 --> 50:37.600]  image of what is privately done what do they do with skull and bones abc news was caught on video
[50:37.600 --> 50:43.840]  worshiping satan doing quote mock human sacrifice that's where the elites just put their kids in
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.280]  these things and see which ones like it they go you like doing the mock thing you know you've uh

[54:25.360 --> 54:35.520]  bathory she would have the court kidnap young maidens and she thought for her beauty and she
[54:35.520 --> 54:44.480]  would bathe in their blood account us wasn't she in transylvania that's where one of the
[54:45.520 --> 54:51.200]  that's where one of the vampire legends come from see all of these legends come from real places
[54:51.200 --> 54:56.720]  these people aren't physical real vampires they're they're they're mentally ill and of course
[54:57.360 --> 55:04.400]  the ancient Greeks dealt with quote vampires and they even had vampire hunting parties going
[55:04.400 --> 55:09.840]  around looking for the insane people that would hide out in caves during the day and come out and
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.880]  kidnap people during the night in fact what's the psychological i'll do a whole video on this
[55:14.880 --> 55:22.000]  pull up all the data so that you know just going from memory there's a psychological term vampirism
[55:22.640 --> 55:25.840]  where these mentally ill people think they're vampires let me just put that in here right
[55:25.840 --> 55:39.520]  vampirism vampirism there you go yep is a sickness and it goes over it um yeah here it is in the
[55:39.520 --> 55:47.120]  encyclopedia it's just vampirism has existed for millennia cultures such as the mesopotamians
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.280]  hebrews ancient Greeks and romans had to deal with people uh running around um thinking they
[55:53.280 --> 55:59.440]  were vampires uh and we know who these folks are see it's not that they're smarter even better than us
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.880]  it's that they're willing to do things that normal people wouldn't do they're very sick they're very
[56:04.880 --> 56:11.040]  degenerate they're very mentally ill and they lust for power and control they think war and death
[56:11.040 --> 56:16.960]  is beautiful and they're trying to now sell the general public on death and torture and murder
[56:16.960 --> 56:23.200]  and sadomasochism to turn our civilization into something that resembles the world they want
[56:23.200 --> 56:29.280]  they want to bring all this out in the open and that's what all the lady gaga vampirism and all
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.440]  that's about for our young girls that's what the record suicides are about and little girls
[56:33.440 --> 56:40.640]  cutting themselves up parents just turn themselves over to absolute total evil
[56:40.640 --> 56:48.880]  and i now have been ranting and i i promise to get to your calls when we start the next hour
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.920]  and i will uh go to all of them but i see see that's the problem every one of these articles
[56:53.920 --> 57:03.440]  is off the chart important and i mean look at this japan confirms total meltdown of three
[57:03.440 --> 57:08.800]  of the six reactors partial meltdown of two so meltdown at five total meltdown at three
[57:08.800 --> 57:15.760]  i told you that two months ago and we had the experts on and i got emails saying oh man you're
[57:15.760 --> 57:22.480]  exaggerating i've studied nuclear engineering uh as a layman i've interviewed top nuclear physicist
[57:22.480 --> 57:30.400]  i've looked at other cases and when you see plants blowing up and you see the fuel rod shooting
[57:30.400 --> 57:37.600]  3000 feet in the air uh and the radiation goes to 7500 times safe levels that's total meltdown
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.960]  they know off the isotopes the type of isotopes that were released exactly what happened and
[57:43.600 --> 57:50.320]  atomic many explosions have been confirmed by german uh russian and british scientists like
[57:50.320 --> 57:55.520]  dr busby and others we've had on i mean they have the isotopes and it's a hundred percent from
[57:55.520 --> 58:00.400]  laboratory experiments and reactors they know well when you have this isotope number you know
[58:00.400 --> 58:07.200]  they've had atomic explosions many explosions there what do you think shoots fuel rods 3000
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.920]  plus feet in the air not steam not a hydrogen explosion but hey i don't have to sit here and
[58:13.920 --> 58:22.880]  convince you anymore cnn japanese government admits total meltdown total explosion terrible at three
[58:22.880 --> 58:29.840]  of them and they knew back then see told you again right again because i'm not spending my time

[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.520]  have two questions one political and one personal about my marriage to see what do you think the first
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.760]  one is i've seen a documentary um about shade gavara and it was pretty interesting it was from
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:52.480]  i fc i think and i just feel like he was very inspirational i'm not sure about all the history
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:02:00.240]  about him and i just think from what he wanted people to be educated and and to have hospitals
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.720]  and stuff i just thought that was good about him i want to see what you how you seen him in history
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:11.440]  well that's obviously propaganda about shade gavara uh shade gavara you can pull up the quotes
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.520]  it basically you know called other latin americans uh he kind of had that spanish style elitism that the
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.960]  at the end in populations were stupid and that's not been what i found uh he talked about wiping
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.160]  out and killing whole groups of people that wouldn't join communism uh they glorify him look look here's
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:37.120]  how the globalist operate they create the narrative of the opposition the bankers create communism as
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.920]  the narrative of how you're supposed to oppose them when meanwhile on record they created it
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.440]  they fund it the ford foundation funds it at every level just like the globalist created al-qaeda
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.520]  and then create the narrative and put out the call with their operatives to have mass shootings at
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:00.240]  shopping malls and then some real patsies might pick up that call and actually do it uh i mean
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.400]  of you know i mean if you got on air and tell people to go jump off a certain building at a
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.360]  certain time there'd be nuts that tried to do it well that's that's basically what they're doing
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:16.000]  there but for i've done deep research on shade gavara and uh he was bad news uh
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.320]  um but i i know they glorify him and build him up and you know put movies out about how great he is
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.240]  um but uh i just do not like shade gavara but i know they sell him like he's a great guy
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.960]  uh you had another question oh yeah thanks for filling me in on that because i really was kind
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.680]  of happy with some of the things i heard him say but now i gotta really go the extra mile finish it
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.000]  up i've been waiting to see how well here's the deal it sounds great to build everybody hospitals
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.640]  but that never gets delivered anytime some group says get collectivize your wealth
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:55.360]  we're going to give it back to you it's always some foreign kingpins funding that to take control
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.440]  of the society government cannot be trusted or or corporate governance then we're now going under
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.320]  that's what we that's what world government is cannot it cannot be trusted all right and
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:15.520]  now my other question was i've been married for two years and four months and i'm having trouble
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.160]  with my marriage i've asked i have advice for my mother's toddler i just want to see because you

[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.920]  thinking about going on my own to focus tonight because i've been for a long time do you have
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:40.720]  children with her yes well you need to not cheat back on her because she's cheating on you

[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.800]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.840]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.440]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.560]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.840]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.320]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:39.680]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.520]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:19.520]  issues and his new best-selling book 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read that we

[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.600]  the broadcast if that's what you believe in i want to go back to your calls but here's some of the
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:36.240]  other news study finds global warming over past four centuries was due to increased solar activity
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:41.120]  and that's out of the peer-reviewed prestigious journal of atmospheric and solar terrestrial
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.960]  physics finds global warming of the 20th century that stopped 15 years ago was not significantly
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:52.320]  different from warning episodes that occurred in earlier centuries the paper finds the increase
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:59.600]  in solar activity in a cycle of the past 400 years explains the warming yeah in 16 1700 it was freezing
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.280]  without any need to search for a unique case of 20th century warming and they go through all of
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.600]  their unbelievable research on that and there's thousands of other major studies they've got the
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:15.760]  ice cores the mud cores they know that's why we had the hiberium maxim 9 000 years ago to start the
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:21.360]  bronze age when the ice age ended man had nothing to do with that but remember two years ago at
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:29.520]  copenhagen the un had a finding and said we voted and and we've decided to save that the sun does
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:36.960]  not affect climate oh don't believe me just type in copenhagen un votes finds that sun does not
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:43.360]  affect climate ladies and gentlemen the sun runs and drives the climate the moon manipulates climate
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.640]  as well blocking solar winds or not blocking them depending on where it's at and it controls the
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:55.760]  tidal forces of 76 percent of the earth's surface water it's a fact for someone to tell you the sun
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.640]  and the moon does not affect climate is like saying oxygen is not what humans breathe i mean i mean
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:09.280]  it is insanely obvious and ridiculous by the way there's a big article in the australian newspaper
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.200]  saying brand or tattoo those of us that are climate deniers first it was global freezing
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.560]  deniers then global warming tires now climate change deniers we don't deny climate changes
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:27.040]  the only thing that stays the same is change all right i'm sorry i'm sorry getting back to weiner
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:34.880]  briefly uh congressman weiner that guy is just such a piece of work anti-gun pro global carbon
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.960]  tax anti-family pro abortion pro world government pro banker bailout lying and saying somebody
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:47.520]  hacked him it wasn't his photo that it might be my photo now hundreds of photos going after media
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.760]  people like brett barred who are willing to expose him it's incredible that he would get up there and
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.960]  say it's not true i didn't do it and then now he's caught of course lying and he hasn't stepped down
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.560]  but but there's a larger issue why are we going after weiner well because the system republicans
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.600]  are involved in all of the big banker bailouts and major corruption most of them with the democrats
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.200]  they don't want to go out for people for real issues 27 trillion missing henry paulson getting 214
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.760]  million dollars of his own bailout money to his own bank account that he ordered i mean that's
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:27.040]  incredible conflict of interest times a million uh just endless corruption major banks caught
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:35.680]  laundering 376 billion dollars wakovia uh and its parent company wells fargo didn't get in trouble
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:42.720]  for that on record leasing and running the aircraft flying it don't get in trouble but weiner they may
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.400]  open a criminal investigation we've seen john edwards don't like him build a group uh builder
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.960]  burr grip attendee don't like him launder a million bucks plus reportedly allegedly to for his for his
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:12:00.480]  for his girlfriend his mistress his squeeze the shack up partner whatever the point is look i'm not
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.240]  for rush limbaugh going to prison for oxy cotton it's a disease he hurt his back he got addicted
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.600]  and i'm not for some 15 year old caught with cocaine to go to prison same thing you know
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:18.240]  these victimless crimes folks uh uh but you commit crimes that have victims see then you get away
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.320]  with it if you're part of the establishment but this does show us they lie continually in our face
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.000]  arrogantly and we've just been conditioned to accept it and then if you question this government
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.040]  individually and collectively that nine times out of 10 if you look at history is lying they
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.440]  tell us they got bin laden but don't show us the body won't release a photo their story changes
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:45.120]  fake situation rim photos and i'm called a conspiracy theorist because i don't just out of hand
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:50.160]  immediately believe them and i have government sources nine years ago that said he was dead
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.880]  and will be rolled out later and it's all done in a theatrical way you can see how it staged
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:03.120]  i question adam gadan an american the head the one of the number one guys in al qaeda
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:10.240]  is a jewish guy from southern california whose granddaddy was the head of the adl and then he
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.480]  says attack shopping malls and and and and you know because we have a bad second amendment
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.640]  written right out of the violence policy center you know playbook and i'm not supposed to just
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.160]  see that and question that on the i mean al qaeda is following a jewish kid i mean come on folks
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.400]  come on come on grow up it's theater they're using the al qaeda threat to come after our guns
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.360]  obama said to make the announcement it goes on and on and on here's some of the other news
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.320]  mexican drug gangs building own tanks as war intensifies we got the video up on info wars
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.360]  dot com that they look like uh blackwater armored vehicles they basically copied those
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.920]  gigantic things right out of the road warrior like the road warrior wishes he had these
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.400]  meanwhile british tourist cruise passengers tell of seven hour security revenge nightmare
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.720]  they didn't want to retina scan in thumbprint one of them complained show the tsa controlled
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.480]  customs told them we're going to punish you and for seven hours stood them out in the hot sun
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.480]  retina scandal screamed at them to get into the united states they flew here to get on a cruise
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.080]  and then before they could go i mean i mean meanwhile the border it's a war zone down here
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.760]  so questioning is not a conspiracy theory questioning hypocrisy and the government that
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.920]  lies to you over and over again is common sense all right that's it let's go to your phone calls here
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.320]  let me punch them up here they're not up on my screen uh let's talk to ed and pa and then peter
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:44.880]  don kathy and tim go ahead ed alex i i would say the best tabloid out there is the globe
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:54.240]  and in 2008 on the april edition the cover story was hillary's gay love scandal and that is uh
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.040]  mr weiner's wife and they're in switzerland right now probably together good and go to the bill
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:06.960]  deberg so i think this is all scripted you know i noticed uh i noticed i remember hearing that
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:11.840]  guys will you pull up scandal hillary's gay lover uh because i remember that but i want
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.160]  to check it from memory i don't i'm not saying you're lying i just have to trust but verify
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:24.960]  as ronald reagan would say here ed uh but they are confident his wife does work uh for hillary uh
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.800]  this stuff's always the tip of the iceberg but but but why would they script this why would
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:39.840]  why would weiner destroy himself like this by releasing these photos alex that she's called
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.520]  hillary's body person and that's she's her traveling chief they're together day and night
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.120]  i don't you care about the lesbian thing but um to keep us from even thinking about bill deberg
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.200]  the main you know because they were saying where's your wife where's your wife and they also knew
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.640]  the end rich we now learn is in europe and and quote is being secretive about where what what
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.440]  he's going to be attending and hillary's been caught repeatedly going to bill deberg and then
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.320]  lying about it and saying she wasn't there we caught her in canada in 06 and 08 with obama
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.240]  we called all the media and said here's obama here's the secret service motorcade
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.040]  the they're both there it's the number one story in the country is where are they hiding missing
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.240]  for a day we're jumping up and down here they are secret service drives by with their machine guns
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:31.920]  aimed at us out their windows i mean it was it was the uh oh it's just incredible absolutely
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.600]  incredible of how controlled this media is but less and less ed ed that's a good point i remember
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.920]  the lesbian lover scandal and and you know what a lot of these tabloids like that's uh like uh
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.280]  uh the inquire they turn out to be accurate you know they were right about john edwards

[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:37.200]  tv thing and when you do these damn things they don't give they don't take into account traffic
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.400]  and things of that nature and i told them there's no way i can make it from there to my house in
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.480]  30 minutes and so that's why they moved you back to 1230 but i made it as fast as i can and i got

[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:53.760]  whatever it may be the golf course maybe well we'll see what happens as long as you don't have a
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:19:00.080]  clinton easter use yeah anyway house things ben since i left uh a lot has been happening what do you
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.600]  make of this congenital lying of a wiener and the whole wiener scandal i'd rather focus on the
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.560]  banker bailouts to see how you drug dealing but what an what a crazy guy why do these politicians
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.520]  think they can get away with uh emailing or or twittering out photos of their of their you know
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:21.200]  here's what you got i tried to explain this on the tv show with neal caludo yesterday and i said
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:27.760]  here's the problem alex it's the big picture you have a system created by the democrats and
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:36.800]  republicans that is so corrupt its basic premise it relies upon is panhandling and bribery that's
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:43.520]  how they get their money they go out and they panhandle give me money so i can go do this job
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:50.960]  or if someone gives them money and they return it to favor well that's bribery so in order to survive
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.280]  in this system which starts up at the local level progresses to the state level and of course gets
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:04.320]  bigger and on to the national level you have to be comfortable with those two concepts panhandling
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:12.320]  and bribery so anyone that reaches that level is obviously comfortable dealing in that corrupted
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:18.400]  system so alex you're going to get not the best of the best you're going to get people who are
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.400]  somewhat borderline criminals to begin with because of the system and how it's built and what the
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.760]  democrats and republicans have created well i'll tell you what scares me and i've interviewed a
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.800]  lot of psychologists psychiatrists you know looking at the profile of western governments and they
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:40.160]  say that people like weiner edwards and others who have no self-control who are out of control and
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:46.720]  who are reckless and narcissistic are the model are the rule not the exception these are the people
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:53.760]  that are in control of our economy the nuclear weapons the intelligence uh and uh it's scary
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:21:00.320]  to think about the fact that they're so reckless and our civilization is in their hands yeah absolutely
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:07.520]  you know it's astounding to believe in today's technology that when you go into those jobs
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:13.920]  they all seem to think that they will be the one to get away with bad behavior and in today's world
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.960]  you know you might have got away with that back in the fifties and sixties when the press didn't
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:25.520]  look at people's private lives that much you didn't have the computer a generation out there
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:29.520]  you didn't have everything you have today where they can photograph you with their phones
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:36.160]  and you know so anyone that gets in a position like that and thinks they're going to misbehave
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:44.880]  and get away with it is sadly mistaken it ain't gonna happen anymore jesse well what do you think
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:52.240]  should happen to congressman weiner stencil i don't know you know he's a democrat and republican
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:58.000]  you know he'll probably get censored you know they have their own uh let's remember something they
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.040]  don't get punished the way we do you know look at it in this aspect alex if we lie to the government
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:12.160]  we go to jail case in point martha stewart berry bonds might go to jail and roger clements might go
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:19.120]  to jail for just simply lying to the government but when the government lies to us nothing happens
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.400]  to them they make a hip hop to get censured or something i used to laugh about that when i
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:31.200]  could talk radio they censure you well what the hell is that why don't they use that on me out here
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:38.480]  in the regular world i'd like to go rob the bank and just get censured well that's like uh wells
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:46.160]  fargo and it's subsidiary 376 billion dollars in laundered drug money over two years and they were
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:53.920]  given a 100 million dollar fine that's 0.3 percent so that's pretty good governor you rob a bank uh
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.440]  or or you engage in a 300 plus billion dollar crime and you pay 100 million so that'd be like
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.400]  if you robbed a million and you paid him a couple thousand dollars fine yeah exactly and that's the
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:11.760]  way it operates there we do not have we have two sets of justice in this country one for the elites
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.640]  and the powerful and one for the rest of us and unfortunately we were all caught in the
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.400]  rest of us thing they don't uh like i said if we lie to the government they we go to jail
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:31.760]  they lie to us all the time and they get promoted well i know that even carvel the big clinton
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.680]  advisor has said that it's the economy stupid now there's reports that obama is now very unpopular
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:43.360]  on the college campuses with liberals headline on college campuses obama is not so cool anymore
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.240]  people are waking up that he's just another puppet but will they embrace the next puppet
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:54.000]  everything's coming to a head and carvel is saying that civil unrest is imminent uh
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:58.640]  the joblessness numbers are now confirmed to be depression level and that's with
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:04.000]  cook numbers that are lower the housing slump is now surpassed depression levels according
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.200]  to the london independent analysis uh but the but the the establishment's telling us governor
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:16.080]  the economy's wonderful uh and uh you know weiner didn't send those pictures and oh oh and libya
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.040]  is in a ground war and we were going to be out in days not weeks remember obama i mean it seems
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.240]  like we've woken up in 1984 but it is starting to come to a head what do you see happening well i
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:32.320]  don't know if it is alex you know uh i hear a lot of talk about it but it's all amongst the same
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:41.120]  people you and i and and this and that and you know i'm not sure uh this country to me is i'm not
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:50.080]  sure what to make of it anymore uh i i i really embaffled uh i will tell you this i was attacked
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:57.600]  by the 9 11 truthers unbelievably because of a few things i've mentioned and asked questions
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:06.240]  about on 9 11 uh i was accused by them of selling out and i got upset over it and i will tell you
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:11.600]  this today on your show because it's the best way to tell it when this book is over because this
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:20.000]  book deals with 9 11 i am going to at that point not discuss 9 11 anymore because i feel like i got
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.440]  blasted from my own side i'm on an island now the truthers don't like me and neither do i
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.240]  suppose does the government because i asked questions uh governor ventura that's that's
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:38.560]  classic uh internet a lot of it's going tell pro just because people claim they're attacking you
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.600]  there's there's seven billion people in the world you're a prominent guy i mean i mean you know this
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:50.960]  i'm preaching to the preacher here i mean just because some minority group gets mad at you because
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  you say it looks like standard explosives and you're a controlled demolition expert you know
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.840]  oh no it wasn't over that i was debunking all three of the standard things no i understand that but
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.440]  i mean you you have a right to your opinion and we and we know the official story is a lie is a
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.200]  fraud is a fiction and so then the full spectrum of trying to figure out what happened there
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:20.080]  is fair game so so i mean i i you know hope that uh you won't let people criticizing you
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.080]  you know have you say well then i just won't even talk about it anymore because i think it
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.600]  needs to be investigated you should write a book about your beliefs and ideas and research
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:37.920]  specifically on 9 11 ventura on 9 11 ventura inside job i i think you should go all the way
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:44.160]  well you know i'll i'll give it due consideration but for me it's like you know alex and it's like
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.120]  pounding your head against the rail after a while it starts to hurt you want to stop doing it well
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:57.200]  let me say this you talk about the american people uh being in a trance or being jellyfish and and
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.400]  why can't they get upset well they have been disempowered they feel like they don't have any
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.120]  power we've got to lead and show them they have power congress has a nine percent approval rating
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.880]  the establishment in cfr documents that come out and brzezinski talks about is panicking
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.920]  that there's such an awakening uh i mean you know in any fight we just got to keep swinging
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.640]  as hard as you can and and and not even think about who's winning and and and the guy that
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.480]  wants it the most is going to win this is a process i mean governor they have genetically modified
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.160]  the food to reduce fertility to make people docile in hundreds of studies sodium fluoride
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:39.360]  does the same thing we have a drugged country that was landed the free home of the brave the most
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:45.040]  vicious the most aggressive the most inventions the most wealth we've been targeted by a scientific
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.480]  dictatorship i have all their documents i'll send them to you i hope you write a book about that
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:54.400]  because we need your voice and and and the public is in a mesmerized state governor they're in a
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:59.920]  mesmerized we've got i mean somebody who's been drugged you know by kidnappers you don't get mad
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.720]  at them when you bust into the shack to try to free them that they're drugged on the floor drooling
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.960]  we got to pick them up and put them on your shoulders get them to the brook pour some water on them
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.800]  or shoot them up with adrenaline if you have to to get them going well yeah i guess i guess i just
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.640]  need to take my periodic breaks from it alex i'm not getting any younger you know hey i don't blame
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.160]  you my instinct is get out of dodge get away from this all of rome is collapsing everybody can feel
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:31.840]  the collapse happening well i certainly hope that it isn't but uh you know it's it's like i said it
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:38.320]  becomes very frustrating to you to you know constantly be telling people and and uh i don't
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.760]  know i guess i kind of view myself now if i can be so bold i i want to replace hunter thompson
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.320]  hunter is gone now and i read some of his works this winter and found that he was writing in the
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:56.000]  sixties about exactly what happened at the turn of the century and what was happening to us in
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.160]  our country he predicted it yeah he predicted tons of it and uh and hopefully maybe that's what i can
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:08.400]  try to do in a way as as i get on in my years here no exactly i mean that is the greatest

[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:50.080]  now going back to governor ventura gov you brought up the fact that as a guy who went through
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:34:01.360]  demolition training as a navy frog man as a udt and then into the seals expanding into that
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.840]  that you understand control demolition and they now have had to admit the building seven did fall
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:10.800]  at freefall nist has changed its story five or six times but you look at tower one and two
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:16.960]  they are exploding with gigantic explosions from the top and turning into dust and the human body
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:22.080]  is blown into tiny pieces and and there are hundreds of these high death photos released by the
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:29.360]  government that show for blocks around toasted cars with the with the metal melted but the vinyl
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:36.240]  and the dashboards not damaged now what attacks metal and makes it do that but doesn't affect
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:43.360]  uh plastic uh does sound like a super weapon i just never really go there because uh i mean i can't
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:47.840]  get folks to understand that a magic passport doesn't come out of mohammed attis shirt through the
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.760]  fireball and then be found on the ground by the fbi the fact that it was found is almost impossible
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:59.440]  the fact that it survived unharmed is unpass is impossible so if i can't get them to even we have
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:05.200]  official fema camp purchases by fema in the houston chronicle and we can't get folks to admit
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.360]  they're building fema camps so so that's why i haven't gone there but governor break it down
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:15.600]  well it's it's a it's a question that came to on some of the reading i did on these toasted cars
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:22.000]  it's remarkable alex there were over one thousand of them and they were as far away as the fdr
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.960]  which is probably six to eight blocks from the trade center and and there were cars flipped over
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:35.040]  on their hoods and in the photos you see the cars flipped on its back but the leaves are still on
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:41.920]  the trees and that's the point of what i'm looking at you're going to how could this happen what is
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:50.800]  the explanation for toasted cars all over manhattan that day well you're not supposed to ask that
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.880]  getting back i mean you don't do that with conventional demolition i read i saw a thing
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:04.080]  on the internet with a nano thermite people claim the cars got toasted from hot nano thermite in the
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:11.440]  dust well that's bogus alex because the dust was hitting people and people were not burning
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:21.280]  obviously the dust was not hot well there is an effect where the fire is hot enough like an oven
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.520]  the metal can heat up and then and then there's also the effect remember this alex everything
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:34.640]  that's burning glows but not everything that go or and everything that's burning glows it is hot
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:45.680]  but not everything that glows is hot no i know it's bizarre and and and you know and and it was
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.880]  i started talking about this on your show and that's when i really got blasted by people
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:57.840]  for even considering questions that to me are very relevant sure sure governor explain this how do
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:04.480]  you explain these cars toasted all over manhattan if two planes hit two buildings and the buildings
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:10.240]  crumble to the ground well let's expand on that whether they were demoed or whatever how can
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:19.680]  buildings falling to the ground toast cars well i can have my crew search infrared photos of ground
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:30.080]  zero molten metal it was upwards of 2800 degrees two months after 9 11 kerosene burns at well under
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:37.200]  1000 degrees less we have the videotapes the firefighters report reporting molten metal
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:45.280]  like a slurry or a steel mill or a volcano those are quotes giant pools about the pictures of them
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:52.880]  dragging oxygen hoses all over the steaming supposed hot metal if it were that hot you
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:38:02.080]  wouldn't dare do that would you well we do have the infrared photos of the uh molten metal well
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:11.040]  again what what melted the metal was it heat or was it so you know to me and the point was made
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:17.280]  of putting into the context of a microwave oven when you when you when you when you put a piece
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:23.440]  of chicken on a paper plate and put it in the oven the chicken will burn and yet the paper plate will
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:33.360]  be unharmed and you have all this paper flying all over manhattan and yet in the rubble there wasn't
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:43.280]  one file cabinet wrecked or anything i think they found one from the common jury store now what
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:50.880]  destroys the file cabinets but allows the paper to survive that is amazing because we saw the
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.720]  tens of millions of pieces of paper coming out after it collapsed and then human body parts
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:03.200]  weren't found that were bigger than an inch very bizarre and how does the paper survive and yet if
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:10.080]  it was so hot that it could collapse the building paper burns way faster than metal does well look
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:18.400]  at the secret helicopter that crash and blew up with the reported navy seals uh at the whole
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:26.480]  bin laden easter bunny raid and that was a totally secret helicopter i mean there is so much super
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.640]  black ops stuff that reportedly the president isn't even led into the federal reserve tells congress
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:37.680]  there above the law no agency can look at them and we have multi levels of private corporate
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.760]  governance above us and and and so shifting gears into a similar area since we talked to you a
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:49.280]  month ago i've seen reports that the navy seals are being totally quiet uh that there's secret
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.480]  subgroups of seal team six they've had to change the story over and over again they admit the
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.000]  situation room video photo was fake he didn't have a firefight with them they threw the body in the
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.360]  ocean they they said they had dna proof a day before it could have been available uh what's
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:11.600]  scuttlebutt are you getting uh from other navy seals that you know in the navy community unfortunately
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:19.040]  none i haven't talked to anybody nothing has been said to me i could only go by what we were told
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:26.400]  uh whether it's true or not i don't know and uh i can't answer anything there for you alex i have
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.000]  not received no scuttlebutt nor will i you have to remember something you i don't think you're
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  going to get anything that actually comes out of the navy seals i don't think that it may be
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.240]  attributed to them but i highly doubt if it is because they're not going to talk about nothing
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:50.160]  you know what pakistan national tv has talked to all the locals and they say the men got on the on
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.520]  the helicopter it took off and then blew up uh how convenient and more and more experts have
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.120]  interviewed are saying that's the word is there all these uh been lauding doubles and and neighbors
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:07.040]  said yeah i knew him he looked like been lauding that wasn't him they go in they kill the guy uh
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:12.080]  the seals get the body and that's what this is saw haul it onto the helicopter this is on
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.560]  national pakistani tv it takes off and blows up you get rid of everybody right there well i haven't
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.520]  heard that there's been that seal casualty list and i'm sure if there were i would hear something
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:30.160]  about that if there were casual well we had uh we had over 10 000 deaths from 60 to 64 before
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:36.960]  they officially launched the vietnam war that were kept secret until the mid 90s yeah well maybe so
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:44.480]  but within our community we usually know who's died who hasn't you know if they keep that from us
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:50.720]  then uh you know it is truly top secret that's all i can say i don't know i have no idea alex i don't
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:56.080]  know anything more than you do in fact i know less than you do i only know what i've been told on
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:01.680]  media reports and what our government has said and weiner told us he didn't take the photo but now he
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:07.920]  myths he lied i mean what is conspiracy theory i mean is it a conspiracy theory to not believe a
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:13.280]  government and a media that has been caught lying tens of thousands of times yeah you're still you're
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:19.200]  still the theorist no matter how many times they lie and no matter how untruthful the mainstream
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:26.720]  media and the government is we're still the conspiracy theorists you know the main thing
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.440]  is that we gotta remember alex is the government only provides a theory they never provide any
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:38.560]  facts i'm still troubled over the fact the big picture of how do we go kill someone for 9 11
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:49.120]  who we never indicted well gov is i mean don't we have a process illegal that we're supposed to
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:57.680]  go through in this country and why are we citizens so eager to allow them to uh skip the process when
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:05.280]  it comes to terrorism we skip the process we we make exceptions to our constitution we make
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:12.480]  exceptions to our bill rights we make exceptions to everything when it deals with this so-called
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:18.720]  war on terror and the people are falling right into the trap that ben franklin warned us of alex
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.840]  when ben franklin said those people that trade liberty for security end up with neither
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:33.760]  or don't our people get that well in every case of history if people that come to you saying give
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:41.200]  me your freedom i'll keep you safe nightmare tyranny always unfolds yes how come we're so
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:47.280]  stupid that we can't look at simple modern day history and see that that is the case
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:58.400]  well i have to tell you um that's what frustrates me alex that's what makes me
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:05.040]  want to move on that's what makes me want to retire because it's like you're preaching and no one's
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:14.000]  listening governor it's the scientific dictatorship they understand our psychology they understand
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:22.240]  our mindsets they have purposefully scrambled people's brains in this sick culture to the point
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:28.800]  that most people just aren't even conscious they see themselves as spectators but it's never been
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:34.320]  a majority that defeats tyranny it's never been a majority that takes over with tyranny it's always
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:41.120]  a minority doing evil that takes over it's always a minority that defeats them you know that governor
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.760]  yeah that's true you know but hopefully you know and as i said hopefully the minority can
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:53.120]  get the majority to wake up but i'm starting to wonder about it what about the tv show what's the
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:59.120]  word on that i don't know yeah they tell me it's a picked up but my deal ran out and no one's
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:04.640]  negotiated with me so maybe they're just going to move forward with it without me i wonder
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.120]  breverman's been calling me a whole bunch and i haven't even called him back i've gotten so busy
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:15.200]  um but uh i mean i i don't know you know they haven't made a new deal with me but my son's
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:22.320]  back on payroll so and they've ordered to pick up of eight more conspiracies uh i'm not happy with
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.640]  the eight they've chosen is that breaking here because my cell phone broke last week and i noticed
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:30.720]  that breverman's been calling me for a week and a half i need to call him today what's the word on
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:36.560]  that i don't know like i said nobody's contacted me except my son and he said that it was that the
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.720]  show's picked up but like i said my contract expired this spring and there's nobody that's
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:49.600]  made one effort to contact me to see about working arrangements for another season and so maybe
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:56.000]  they're going to do the show like i said without me well that originally was your idea yeah that's
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.840]  true but let's remember too i'm in a dilemma because of my lawsuit against the tsa you know i can't
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:08.000]  get on a plane until some type of settlement occurs we're doing court i think later this
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.720]  month or early july ironically i guess i have the same judge that handled the nfl and the uh owners
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.240]  well we know that the resistance of the tsa is mounting uh texas is trying to reintroduce the
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.520]  bill that we had a unanimous vote on but then the governor used his his minion the lieutenant
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.520]  governor to kill it the senate perry claims he supports it but called a special session governor
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.720]  and will not reintroduce it so far i mean i i'll tell you that's a dirty politician right there
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:48.240]  well i'll tell you i heard about that and i can't believe me you know alex i thought texas had spines
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.840]  well i mean our house voted unanimously they had 30 of the 31 senators remember alex get what i'm
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.920]  saying i'm goading you texas come on well you're allowed to go this because you have followed suit
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.400]  on them and i've seen you stand up to them at the airport well the point is come on texas
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:12.160]  get the spine you're from texas you don't mess with texas that's what i've always heard
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.560]  so i i encourage texas to move forward on that you even named your son after a fictional texan
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:26.240]  didn't you no not really a texan i named him after tyrell sack at the mora gunfighter and the sack
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:31.760]  of family i think originated from tennessee okay well everybody from westward well i mean texas
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:37.200]  is tennessee i mean that's the volunteer folks that's really texas is an extension of tennessee
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.960]  if you really know the history okay well whatever but all i know is come on texas stand up and get a spine
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:50.560]  i hear you well at least we're trying i mean at least we're leading the way and now utah says
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:53.360]  they're going to call the feds bluff what do you think of them saying they'd have a federal
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.560]  blockade of the state well you know it it's interesting if the feds are going to do things
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:04.480]  like that then we ought to do things back to them and like everybody refused to fly for a day i agree
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:09.680]  see what that'll do well see they want to slowly bankrupt the airlines and then nationalize them
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:14.320]  they don't want to have to have it all overnight happen so i agree listen my family doesn't fly
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.600]  i cannot let people grab my daughters i just i cannot put up with it and and and and folks
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.000]  i tried once and did and did get really angry and i'm not going to get into the whole story
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.120]  but the point is is that i can't handle it that's right i can't either and that's why as a country
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  we ought to we ought to get an official day where everybody boycotts flying and down the
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:41.520]  airlines for a day in protest play to every to all of us wait let's have national opt-out week

[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.920]  want to thank you tate what's on your mind well it gets back to what you all were talking about
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:01.680]  with uh congressman weiner and the narcissism of a lot of the politicians today and i've had
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.680]  a question for the governor i know he worked with two movies with uh governor schwarzenegger
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:13.600]  uh predator and and and i realized that there weren't a whole lot of women on the set in fact
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:20.000]  there was only one woman character in predator uh but i just want us to know if he had any if he
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:27.920]  saw any inclinations of governor schwarzenegger's uh kind of risque behavior okay jade i appreciate
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:33.680]  your call what's your take on sports i can tell him is that when i worked with arnold during predator
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:40.960]  was when he actually flew off the hyena support that week and got married so we go all the way
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:46.800]  back to the point where arnold and maria actually first got married and and you know i i didn't
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:52.160]  i didn't i was doing a job i don't pay attention to hollywood stuff like that exactly i mean he's
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.400]  not going to be following the gospel with some other you know man's doing but what do you think
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:02.400]  about the fall of arnold well you know it's his own fault uh you know if he fathered a
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:09.440]  kid out of marriage uh i don't get it i mean i i'm friends with both i admire maria tremendously
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:17.440]  and i can't figure out for the life of me why why men in general who have steak at home
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.320]  will go out and eat hamburger on the road
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:29.040]  exactly that's a good way to put it i don't get it i mean i i maria shriver's gorgeous
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:36.800]  she's a beautiful woman she's has a brilliant mind i don't understand it but then again
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:42.800]  that's why i me i guess well sir say how do your wife for me your wife is also lovely as well

[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.560]  i was just talking to vinter during the break and
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:33.520]  they've been calling me for almost two weeks i haven't my phone was screwed up for a few days
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:38.560]  and i don't get to calls and i don't ever handle it uh but i need to call them i i didn't know the
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.680]  tv show conspiracy theory picked up for third season i think that's breaking news here uh but
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.160]  ventura doesn't even know if he's going to be involved in it they've actually i'm not going
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:51.840]  to get into the whole thing i particularly don't want to do the show if you want to get honest
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.600]  folks think that uh you know doing national tv is a big deal and uh if it's not hardcore issues
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:03.120]  it's not if it's the search for easter bunnies the search for tuba cabras the search for um
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:10.240]  um wolfman and ghost i'm not doing it and ventura is not either they just told me that and that looks
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.640]  like the way they want to go and and and that's what the establishment does it got record ratings
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:19.200]  first season they put it in the dead zone on fridays they banned the re-air of the fema camp
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.320]  show and uh if you just join us we just had jesse ventura on for minnesota governor who's
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.880]  going to be on for an hour but they booked him too much and that's why he was in a grumpy mood
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:36.240]  you can you can say what you want about jesse ventura but he's a real guy he's the real deal
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:43.440]  uh i've seen people sit around and make jokes about um you know jesse ventura's new world order
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:48.560]  he's that no he's definitely the real deal he definitely believes what he says says what he means
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:54.640]  and um i hope the season gets picked back up but it got more hardcore in the second season
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:00.240]  and the system panicked it was successful monetarily it was successful in the ratings
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.840]  very successful in the reason i was involved in the consultant in the mission and the network um
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:13.840]  because you know ventura was just talking about it so now i can it's kind of works as a journalist
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.240]  other sources tell you something but it's off record then you don't get into it but then when
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.560]  another source tells you something that's not off record then you can talk about it from that source
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.960]  so that's why i specifically brought that up during some of the breaks with him uh but uh
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:34.640]  that's how they've always the system has always seen quote conspiracy theories questioning government
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:39.600]  as palatable as long as you mix the federal reserve is private and there's a world government
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:46.000]  forming and it's run by cuba cobras and i'm not criticizing people that talk about everything
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.640]  look at everything the world is a place of mystery they've got major newspapers reporting on google
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:59.920]  Hubble telescope maps showing it looks like a human base it looks like a nasa moon model base
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.520]  i've seen uh that's there uh i mean if you'd have told somebody 300 years ago they're going to have
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.480]  atomic weapons and there's little invisible things you can't see that when you bounce them together
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:16.560]  can blow up whole cities folks would think you were nuts so uh i always question everything and i
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:23.200]  think anything could be possible it's just that i only cover what i can prove because i know for a
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:31.680]  fact that uh the royals i've seen a lot of reports over this over the years were involved in human
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:37.120]  flesh life extension therapies and pituitary gland but oh it was out of cadavers yeah right
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:41.680]  then you have the male today daily male british royalty died on human flesh but don't worry it
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:49.680]  was 300 years ago uh whatever um i'm going to come back go to your calls and and i'm i'm sorry

[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:12.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:21.920]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:28.560]  okay we're eight minutes into the third and final hour of the official transmission
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:36.960]  occasionally i go into the fourth hour which is internet only at info wars.com but i'm getting
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:42.000]  very close to launching my daily tv show then the fourth hour will cease to be it's still up on the
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:48.400]  satellite they just repeat the first hour in the um in the fourth hour but that gets confusing for
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:54.720]  some stations so the problem is i love talk radio i love information and i'm so long winded as you
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:03.760]  know even though i got rid of that seat for like 14 years i guess 13 years i did uh three hours
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:09.600]  and then i greedily added a fourth hour for two years and then i got rid of it again so that's
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:15.840]  what's happening to explain what's going on there and it also gives us flexibility that sometimes
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:20.720]  we go into the fourth hour because sometimes we have some big breaking news and of course i'm
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.960]  known to go five six seven hours if there's big breaking news and just continue sitting here in
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:31.360]  the studio uh because this is all i think about anyways in fact my biggest problem is i'm not as
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:37.120]  articulate verbally as i am mentally as we all are but i'm just sitting there and thinking and
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:42.560]  looking at all the connections and history and ways to defeat this system now i'm going to go to
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:49.200]  your calls here and then i'm going to get into officials uh admit that they're bombing kadafi's
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:54.240]  compound again blew up the tv station this is the war that would last days not weeks now it's
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.040]  lasted months and they say it's going to go into next year now they'll be bombing it in 10 years
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:06.800]  if he holds out because it's uh not a war it's a kinetic action uh syria warns of more marches on
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:14.880]  israeli border you can say what you want and and about either side but those palestinians unarmed
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:23.120]  marching into machine gun fire that's courage i see our media calling them cowards marching up a hill
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:31.120]  unarmed to be killed is are cowards and and saying well they're funded by the syrian government
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:39.120]  regardless they shouldn't be mowed down arrest them i mean is this going to be exported here
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.520]  that if you protest something and the police are just going to shoot you i guess in a lot of cases
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.280]  they do if you're a redsox fan and walk out of a bar and they should get off the street and you
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.840]  say okay and they shoot you from three feet away in the head with a rubber bullet the cops said hey
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:57.040]  good killing she deserves it didn't move quick enough so i guess that's the new system i saw
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:02.400]  two articles a day about taser deaths in the last day and they've upped the power of the tasers and
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:06.720]  people are dying all the time young people are dying not just old guys that have heart attacks
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.360]  and now they say you didn't jump quick enough when i said give me your driver's license i'm gonna
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:19.760]  punish you with this they're just i'm ranting i said i go to your calls it's just as a human being
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:27.520]  watching those people be mowed down upsets me but our media says their cowards and deserve it
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.800]  they're dehumanized okay well we're going to be dehumanized next that's all i'm saying
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:37.600]  i remember those images of the nazis lining up jews and germany at at pits and shooting them
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:45.600]  in the back of the head and throwing them in there that's upsetting that's upsetting watching
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:50.640]  those folks getting mowed down but i guess we're land of the free home of the brave and
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:56.000]  world war three is getting geared up to be started there are all these proxy wars
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.440]  the depression is full on but the mainstream media tells us we're having a big recovery
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:05.600]  and weiner didn't send those photos and john edwards isn't at that mistress and bill clinton
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.280]  didn't have sex with that woman and the bankers wouldn't tell us where the money went but they
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:13.440]  said it wasn't the foreign banks turns out over 70 percent was the foreign banks that
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.240]  owned her on america but again i should just sit down and shut up and believe whatever i'm told
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:20.960]  let's go ahead and talk to dustin in utah dustin you're on the air
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:25.680]  Alex how you doing man first of all i want to say i love you love your show love what you do

[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.160]  deal okay because everybody takes a lot of time thanking me and i want to thank you as a listener
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.600]  for caring and being involved and putting up with me dustin all right well i have a civil
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.200]  liberties question for you um i've been involved in a civil liberties fight for about three years
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:51.360]  now i'm gonna quickly just briefly blow through it on what they did was uh through through this
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:58.240]  patriot act through this um just a tip from an anonymous person they the police came to my house
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:03.840]  put a gps tracking device on my vehicle and followed me around for six months um and without an
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:09.280]  authorization or a warrant signed by a judge um they saw that i went to a friend's house quite a
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:14.160]  bit they raided him while he was out of town um at work and his seven month pregnant girlfriend
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:20.480]  was home alone yeah that happens very often uh federal court has ruled they can put gps on
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:26.880]  your car with no warrant that's your property person place papers effects property you know read
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.760]  the fourth amendment in fact we'll put the fourth amendment on screen so i can read it exactly just
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:38.160]  please it's totally illegal it's what the stasi did the stasi would put radioactive isotopes
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:45.120]  on your floor mat so they could literally with a special light follow where you'd gone it's the
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:50.000]  same thing the stasi did just with more high tech uh and i see these reports all over the country
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:56.560]  where people take the device off and then the fbi comes and demands it back and they're tracking
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:01.200]  our phones but but but you notice what happened an anonymous tip they have got an endless army of
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:07.760]  crackhead methhead that's who they use convicted felons who will walk up to any house and the cops
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:13.680]  don't care that they're lying and say it's like a dog that alerts because it gets given biscuits
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:18.480]  to alert to falsely alert mostly police dogs are trying to false alert and well every car
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:23.040]  they put the dog on oh sorry shows drugs at the check point since you said you wouldn't let us
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:29.520]  search without a warrant flash here who you know is overweight once another biscuit so he you know
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:34.160]  he alerts and barks that's happened to me a couple times uh when i said no you're not going to
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.480]  search without a warrant oh well flash says he smells something i'm like yeah right you better
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:45.120]  not plant something buddy i don't use any of your products okay and so yes that's the new situation
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:48.880]  of course why even do that now they just pull you over and take the cash out of your wallet and
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.640]  Dallas they admitted nobody got in trouble they pulled over thousands of cars through bags of
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:57.360]  chalk in the back took the car saying it was cocaine that's that's how america rolls i mean
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:01.520]  that's all admitted four years ago and they still do it it's like yeah we do it and we frame you
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:08.080]  and that's how and then the crime lab would certify the uh chalk as cocaine okay so that's
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.720]  again i'm i'm in top police now because i don't want to plant in shock on me well they're doing it
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:17.520]  it's admitted and they go well that's pro law enforcement we frame you but so your friend
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:22.800]  gets raided because you went to his house a lot and yeah that's how they work they have the crack head
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:28.480]  come up and go that's the house i bought it in there and then they get to put the gps on your car
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:34.160]  so i'm sorry dustin tell me more about your case um well actually what has happened is there's a
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:39.520]  long standing statute in utah constitution that says in order to electronically with an electronic
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.440]  device follow someone around you have to have an authorization signed by a judge or a warrant
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:49.200]  signed by a judge if it's on private property well it was on my private property and um i'm on my
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:54.400]  third attorney now and it's uh it's the judge that this is what the judge said to me at my
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:58.960]  motion hearing he said on the issue of the gps tracking advice the placement of the gps tracking
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:04.080]  advice on your vehicle without authorization or warrant was unlawful but that didn't violate your
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:09.360]  fourth amendment rights so he admitted that it was unlawful what the police did to me it was against
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:14.320]  long standing utah statute but he's going to allow it to happen anyway so i was just like so
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:21.200]  so do i take responsibilities for these uh lawman's unlawful action but anyway what what i figured out
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:28.000]  was um through this involuntary education in the constitution and uh and that's what ventura talked
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:34.240]  about last night congress is exempt from almost every law that they put on us this is a criminal
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.160]  government for people that go why would the government ship the drugs in to launder the money
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:43.280]  then the big launderbanks on record of the biggest owners of the private prisons
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:49.360]  then when you the end user buy their drugs they then put you in their private prison
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:55.840]  working for 25 cents an hour it's pure genius it is it's a it's a racket the second district
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:01.600]  court in utah is the biggest racket in northern utah and and this involuntary education has
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:07.840]  really taught me a lot of things and alex i've i've found their achilles heel i i what i have
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.480]  i i have some intellectual properties that i don't i don't only feel that are essential
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:18.640]  to the revolution i feel they are key to the revolution and um basically what i have here
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:23.520]  is i'm i'm the registered federal trademark holder of the slogan cannabis activist i have
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:28.800]  i've developed a hemp closing line called cannabis activist and uh it's the only thing
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:33.360]  that i can do to fight for my rights at this point i mean they've i've lost my home i've lost my
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.480]  cars every everything of value that i've ever had i've i've thrown right at this um fight for my
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:46.000]  freedom in our rights and i i found out that um all these big oil companies all these big
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.560]  pharmaceutical companies all these big timber companies all these other companies they are
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:55.840]  all scared of one seed and and it's the hemp seed because it grows in 50 different states like a
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:02.400]  weed and if we were to utilize it for no it's big rows everywhere it's better than cotton
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:07.840]  you can make great oil out of it uh it it it's one of the main crops that built this country
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:14.000]  even more than cotton or tobacco and in the 1930s a dal chemical in dupont openly lobbied
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:22.480]  to have marijuana ban but also all of the hundreds of varieties that don't have thc and so yes uh you

[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:13.280]  i'm not saying it's a bad idea but the there are better ideas they have protest every single day

[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:23.520]  what you're supposed to do it's happened twice before in texas storming the capital that made
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.440]  national intention what i did and that was just spontaneous because i was angry i didn't even
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:33.120]  tend for that to happen uh it was and our dancing of the jefferson memorial and people being arrested

[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.160]  that'll be better but just a key announcement coming up at the start of the next segment
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:22.240]  kathy in texas you're on the air thank you for holding yes hi alex as you know i'm sure the texas
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:29.680]  senate has just recently voted to cut public teachers pay and put them on non-paid furloughs
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:34.400]  and i'm sure the house will support this since we have do hearth and perry there
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  what my question is since texas instituted the lottery system and the proceeds were supposed
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:47.440]  to go to fund education where's the money and how do we find out where the money is well the texas
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:51.440]  lotteries actually gotten in trouble uh quite a few times there's a long history of that but all
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:57.120]  over the country different lotteries are always connected in well with the good fellas if you
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:04.000]  know what i mean and uh you you know casinos are going in everywhere and they always push how great
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:09.360]  they are for economies if people think los vegas is great or they think the area i mean i've been
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:14.960]  around these places i've seen it the prostitutes the unhappy people the folks that are spending you
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:22.960]  know their kids uh college fund to their own retirement i mean i just gambling is for suckers
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:27.600]  and is for losers and i mean it's one thing if you want to play a game of poker with your buddies
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:31.760]  and you know bet quarters or something i've done that that's fun to make it interesting or if you
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:36.320]  want to bet 20 bucks with your buddy on a football game that's one thing but just this whole culture
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:42.880]  of big giant buildings and and and and people and they're getting scammed uh it really makes me want
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:48.160]  to throw up uh and yeah it was supposed to be for texas education but but here's the deal they're
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:54.400]  slashing police fire i mean it's all over the news this week all of some departments are slashing
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:27:00.160]  60 percent of their deputies crime is exploding while the government moves to not let citizens
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:06.160]  have guns to protect themselves i mean this is incredible and they're cutting the teachers pay
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.960]  they're doing all of this claiming it'll fix the deficits it'll fix the budgets no nothing is going
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:19.360]  to be fixed until we get rid of the fractional reserve banking system and say no to the derivatives
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:26.320]  too big to fail fraud that these private banks induced government to sign on to uh and to underwrite
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:33.360]  uh and uh it is a huge fleecing that's going on all over the country people talk about rick
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:38.880]  perry made texas great no rick rick perry has made texas worse it's just that texas is better
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:43.360]  than other states because it had the lowest tax rates in the country uh i guess there's a few
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:48.160]  states that might be on par but not the resources of the or the amount of people now i'm ranting
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:54.640]  about this all the data perry got the franchise tax passed that's an income tax on business owners
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:28:01.040]  it's huge i have to pay it every year he got the hospital district tax passed so travis county can
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:07.200]  take my money and spend it for a taxpayer funded abortions he was for forced inoculations of girls
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:12.880]  with a drug they knew garter cell that was killing people that by him mandating anything gave it
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:18.240]  government protection for liability i mean the guy was for the nafta highways the guy is a monster
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:23.760]  and notice he hasn't put on the special session though he said he supported it he hasn't put
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:30.000]  it on the special session the anti groping bill as i predicted no matter how much pressure
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:36.560]  we need to put more on him but it's just incredible because again he walks around the cowboy hat and
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:43.840]  go yeah i'm a real texan boy yeah boy but he's the opposite he needs to be nailed to a post and he
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:50.000]  needs to be forced to say where the money has gone i mean if he's settling up to end up to los
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.720]  vegas up to those people all right we need to know that if it's not if it's not being put in the

[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:07.600]  important news before this hour in broadcast ends and that news is we're launching a internet
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:12.640]  newsletter and you're like oh great another internet newsletter well this was going to be a little
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:19.440]  different and the reason we're launching this friday and you can sign up for free at info wars.com for
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:25.920]  it is because we've analyzed the internet kill switch the un treaties being agreed to the secret
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:35.120]  copyright treaty that was leaked a month ago or now two months ago and the whole web is going to
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:40.640]  cloud computing it's going to force you to have your data somewhere else and then you just have
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:45.680]  a device that ties into it in three or four years you won't even be able to buy a computer a laptop a
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:51.200]  device all they're going to be a screens and it's going to be roll out plastic they've had this over
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:57.120]  a decade that's just a screen they're going to have newspapers that are digital that are just a
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.400]  piece of clear plastic that you move around has a tiny battery on it they also have systems where
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:08.320]  the back of it is solar powered so you lay your newspaper down it gets empowered by the sun
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:13.280]  in just a few seconds you turn it over or if you're in the sun it could shoot through the front and
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:17.920]  then empower it but side issue and again that's how my brain works I start going down rabbit
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:23.440]  trails I'm just trying to briefly here describe to you while we're launching this newsletter
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:31.840]  the internet is being carved up under the internet to corporate agreements for global private
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:37.680]  corporate governance not just over our nations our industries our resources but also over the
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:49.280]  internet and cyberspace and so microsoft google apple yahoo all these big groups are openly carving
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:56.960]  up the web and the new architecture of it through cyber security that enforces it where basically
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:02.480]  more and more websites like drudge report dot com info wars dot com and in google said this again
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:09.760]  last month won't really be accessible on most networks because the web so big they basically
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:19.200]  just phase in new quote private networks where when you agree to be on youtube you agree to be on
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:27.600]  google you agree to have a sub website on their platform and it's more complex than just what
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:33.440]  I'm saying and I've done special videos on it and broken it down but the point is we're in so much
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:38.560]  trouble there's a move to start shutting down the web as we know it and so going low tech
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:44.000]  with email is something that will circumvent to a point it's one more weapon on our arsenal
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:51.280]  to deliver content that is not on the internet but is physically delivered to you and so there's
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:58.640]  going to be exclusive articles every week exclusive videos that are sent directly to you and it links
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:04.480]  to things on the web as well and it's the info wars insider and it's info wars information
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:10.160]  directly to you and it's just one more thing we're launching along with the new studio and the tv
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:15.680]  show we're developing and all the other things that we've expanded over the years it's one more
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:21.520]  tool in that fight and if you go to info wars dot com at the top of the
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:30.400]  right hand corner there is a yellow banner that says the info wars insider special reports
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:36.320]  hottest news insider scoop and then when you put your email in there it takes you to a welcome
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:40.960]  page that tells you what you're going to be getting and it's just a way where even if they
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.760]  block info wars dot com or prison planet dot com or if they block it off certain networks it's already
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:52.400]  starting to happen we can still pound out an email directly to you now more and more info wars dot
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:59.040]  com and prison planet dot com are being added onto the spam filter software that people buy to
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:09.360]  quote keep their kids safe and in the filters they'll have hate spam hacking porn gambling
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:13.520]  those will be the categories and we're put under under hate or hacking though we're not
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:19.920]  involved really in any hacking type news we're a major mainstream very powerful media outlet
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:26.080]  we are becoming the mainstream the system is scared of straight talk scared of common sense
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:32.960]  and uh more and more we've been delisted from google uh they're coming after us but we're still
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.680]  growing despite that and so the system is trying to curtail us and i should be glad they're just
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:41.840]  trying to assassinate my character in the media i should be glad that they're just trying to block
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:46.720]  me in cyberspace instead of just setting me up and putting me in prison or killing me but they
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:51.360]  don't want to make me a martyr so they're just they're trying to to stave the bleeding they're
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.280]  trying to tie a tourniquet around their ankle uh that you know because we've chewed their leg off
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:59.840]  here and it's not going to work because we'll just run over start chewing on the other ankle
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.560]  and then we'll climb up and chew on their throat like a pit bull we're not letting go we're not
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:09.920]  stopping genies out of the bottle horse already left the barn train left the station that ship
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:15.600]  already sailed people know what's going on and that's the most exciting thing i can tell you
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:21.280]  it's not just my radio show and the numbers off the charts on terrestrial uh internet shortwave
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:28.560]  satellite all of that it is the fact that i listen to talk radio and the callers on liberal
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:34.640]  conservative libertarian are calling in going wait it's not either i'm a republican or i'm a democrat
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:40.320]  may line republicans say all corporations are good pure as a driven snow uh all governments bad
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:44.400]  or democrats are all governments good all corporations are bad people are figuring out
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:50.240]  it's mega corporations that aren't free market teaming up with government to rob us that simple
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:56.080]  great truth is now out there and people are getting it and that's the beginning of the end
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:02.720]  once people look past the pitch men the pr men like obama and rick perry once they look to the
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:08.640]  offshore banking cartel who gets the bailout money the trillions who lobbies to raise our gas
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:14.480]  prices as gm is doing today they're a brokerage firm once people figure that out that it's mega
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:20.880]  corporations using government to ban their competition game over so again the free info wars

[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.760]  hey sir i'd like to tell you a sigh out there is rain on us fly over the memorial day weekend in
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:54.080]  bollinggreens evidently the fbi in conjunction with local law enforcement uh over a 20-minute
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:41:03.440]  month period radicalized two local iraq nationals into basically trying to ship weapons back to iraq
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:10.960]  and from what the local news says the iraqi nationals posted in 2009 that on a blog that
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:17.680]  they were upset that america was still occupying iraq and this basically entailed the fbi
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:24.720]  embedding a inform not inform but undercover agent posing as an al-qaeda member
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:29.360]  yeah to be their leader yeah yeah yeah you see that's the difference this isn't just entrapment
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:36.080]  this is fomentation this is provocaturing uh even the new york times even the associated press
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:42.080]  last year they had a rash of these all over the country and the media said why do you get people
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:48.880]  with you know that aren't even muslim surnames or arabic surnames uh people with names like you
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:54.720]  know ramirez and things out of prison they always have low iqs they profile the white the black the
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:42:01.520]  hispanic the asian america al-qaeda they're always close to mentally retarded ad iq or so
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:07.360]  they profile them they profile them in prison they get out and a guy you know named habib a rock med
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:14.560]  a con or whatever shows up and sometimes takes years gives them money takes care of them get
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:19.600]  them to shoot their mouths off about how they're going to attack and do all these incredible things
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:26.160]  and it's used as a prcu to then uh because they've got to have an enemy to spend these trillions
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:31.040]  every year overall it's over a trillion if you count part of the defense budget for anti-terror
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:35.040]  and then the 500 billion or so with the other agencies involved in it and the billions and
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:41.040]  body scanners and the face scanning cameras they need to have these dummy groups and so
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:45.360]  they'll get a drug doubt mutala get him on the plane on record u.s. government got him on the
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:50.960]  plane state department admits it uh they'll get a crazy uh a psychiatrist and statistically
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:54.960]  they're crazier than anybody else statistically and then he's protected and run by a lockie who
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:59.680]  works for the pentagon and yeah they constantly have these i did see that case and it's always the
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:04.240]  same story it's not fbi infiltrating a group it's planning something you know that gets into their
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:10.960]  meeting they go out have the leader open mosque up in some cases and sit there and preach for years
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:17.280]  about killing they tried that with militias for a decade with howl turner who attacked me every week
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:22.000]  and i said that guy's an fbi agent if there ever was one nobody's allowed to get up and say
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.520]  get this federal judge get this state judge and finally and then all the emails have been released
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:32.480]  well first he got hacked and was when he got hacked and the emails got released by good patriots
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:39.200]  that then the feds burning uh and it came out in federal court national security asset above
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:45.600]  fbi but but controlled through the fbi and they tried i mean folks i have tried to build a veteran
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:50.640]  a house when they bulldozed this house and they had cops coming on saying let's attack the police
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:56.800]  i can't have a video signing at a movie theater without cops coming in and saying let's go after
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:02.480]  the police i can't go to a builder bar group meeting and be at my own hotel eat the hamburger
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:08.640]  in the bar without big giant cops coming obviously cops would shave head you shave heads
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.920]  you know 50 years old i mean look tough as nails and i'm not even saying they're cops it turned out
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:19.760]  they were uh state department diplomatic cia security and and and say alex let's attack the
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:24.160]  state department tomorrow and i'm just like come on man you're a cop take a photo of him
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:29.520]  and it's like come on you guys know you've profiled we're nonviolent you just hope that i
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:35.280]  joke around with you so you could have on the news i'm a terrorist you know it's this country's
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:40.480]  gone folks it's so gone i don't know how we're going to get it back i mean does anybody believe
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:46.800]  that a fat jewish kid from southern california is the is in the top four commanders of al-qaeda
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:53.120]  maybe number one adam gadan who now is putting out a spiel of anti-gun you know buy guns at gunshows
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:59.200]  and kill people i mean this is totally staged i mean i mean is there no end are we so stupid is
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:04.880]  it so fun to buy into the fake fable of al-cia that we've got to let the globalist destroy our
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:09.840]  society all you good old boys have got to grow up or it's over you better check the facts and
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:15.040]  realize this jeff anything else yeah the the thing of it is that they said they got picked up in
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:22.240]  03 by us forces for ied manufacturing thing if it is i was in our act in 04 and we didn't
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:26.560]  for do any forensics on ids because they're too unstable they blow up on your face so how did
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.400]  they pick these guys up and then all of a sudden they end up in bowling green kentucky of all
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:36.640]  places in 09 well that's another thing see i you reminded me of the details yeah and you can look
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:45.520]  this up let me think of the exact headline al-qaeda government stages arrest of al-qaeda operative
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:50.480]  who was really cia and they do this all the time they'll stage the arrest of one of these guys
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:46:00.160]  use it to say we caught you know uh hot beep uh trying to blow us up and then a year later
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:06.240]  it'll come out oh he was really cia they staged his arrest to protecting and so yes in some of
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:13.680]  these cases we'll remember i've been covering this since 1996 5000 plus irakis were brought in by
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:18.800]  george herbert walker bush and and then bill clinton bush brought in 3000 clinton over 2000
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:25.040]  and and they were involved in around oklahoma city and that came out in local oklahoma news
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:31.760]  there are 5000 of these irakis that i've said hundreds of times will be used in the shopping
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:38.560]  mall attacks in the future for the mass roundup well bowling green is one of the big areas that
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:43.200]  during the serbian war that they brought over refugees from Serbia a lot of malbenians and
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:48.720]  then also in iraq they brought over a lot of refugees from iraq and now we've got a large
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:53.360]  mughlin population who by the way are a large number of pillars of the community doctors
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:59.760]  lawyers stuff like that and these guys got picked up by the fbi and i think it was that since they
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:04.320]  were over here trying to provocateur these guys trying to get the other mughlums to basically
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:09.040]  riot with them or do something with them and it didn't work that they just pulled their assets out
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:17.040]  absolutely sir i concur with your analysis thank you so much jeff i gotta get to josh jack
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:23.120]  scanner ryan i gotta hit a little bit on this eco like thing but remember last week uh the police
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:29.040]  reportedly shot a guy a whole bunch of times in his car in miami and then they put guns in people's
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:34.320]  faces reportedly beat him up uh folks that videotaped it but they were able to hide the sim card in
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:40.000]  their mouth other people shot it from on top the roof and it reminds me of that when they shot
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:44.480]  that guy in the back who was in handcuffs and then said he was resisting and not in handcuffs
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:50.800]  in the bay area and then said that there were no cameras but it turned out they'd confiscated
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:57.680]  the cameras but somebody shot it and hid their camera and it's just really scary to see statistically
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:04.000]  how police will get caught lying but because of internet technology this big brother stuff cuts
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:12.400]  both ways and they're not going to be able uh to get away with this so i would suggest police
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:17.680]  clean up their act the corrupt politicians that run this country want to give you a long leash
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:28.880]  and encourage you to uh dishonor your uniform but it's it's it's not gonna happen here are police
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:34.960]  aiming guns at people down the street that uh we're we're playing the video we can't play the
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.000]  audio there's too much cussing we'll we'll edit this and bleep it out tomorrow and then uh play

[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:08.000]  and more i just wanted to add that josh in florida you're on the air
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:13.040]  alex i just wanted to thank you for all that you do i've been waiting to talk to you
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:16.080]  uh for a while and then you're a busy guy but i just want to thank you for all that you do
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:22.320]  my question is uh i want to help get ron paul elected i think he's the last choice you know
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:27.280]  last hope that we've got but i also want to know you know biggest thing is how do we organize
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:31.600]  locally and get people to understand you know see your videos understand really what's going on
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:39.200]  well look ron paul is a great hope but he is not the only hope we got stage rights we individually
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:44.480]  are waking people up uh folks are really starting to figure out who the players are here on the good
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:50.640]  team and the bad team ron paul whether he wins loses or draws wins because he'll be able to inject
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:57.120]  real issues during this campaign season that will dwarf what he was able to do three years ago uh and
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:04.880]  so we need to point out that rick perry mit mit romney wrote the health care law that obama copied
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:11.040]  this is who we want as the republican frontrunner ron paul's number two a guy who's as phony is a
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:18.400]  three dollar bill uh i mean so that's what i say perry i told you two years ago is gonna run for
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:24.960]  president i mean that's the uh inside baseball from texas republicans we've got uh and perry is
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:29.680]  a billderberg group attendee i know he wears cowboy hats and struts around in cowboy boots but
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:38.800]  again he's as fake as they come uh he's a phony and so people better not vote for what they see
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:45.520]  as the cool politician who they think the winner is they better vote for ron paul in these primaries
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:51.840]  and then if ron paul loses and some republican wins and they become president you're just gonna see
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:56.480]  me they establish for a few more years of conning people like with obama

[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:20.400]  that's why they can't find the source and meanwhile it's reported whole foods admits
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:26.160]  it's organic foods contingentically modified ingredients folks in every major study and
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:31.520]  i'm gonna do a special video on this i mentioned it earlier in the last week in every major study
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:37.600]  i mean here's one right here u.s department of agriculture funding corn and rice studies

[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:49.760]  men and then i look at the long-term studies on stuff that's been deployed in the last decade
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:54.160]  it's reducing fertility in the in the crops that are already approved and we're eating
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:57.920]  you wonder why fertility is dropping it's dropping you wonder why cancer is off the
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:03.760]  chart i wanted to talk about katherine albrecht in fact jaren we've got to get her on i've meant to
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:08.000]  but i didn't want to bother her she asked me to fill in for her a few months ago when
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:12.400]  she had surgery and then besville and chemo and i just i can't do two hours after my show every day
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:17.760]  would be too exhausting but i think to honor her before she quits doing her show weekdays i
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:24.000]  probably need to do it but we need to have her on she is going into stage four breast cancer

[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:13.840]  because i'm a fat slob and i laid on my back and looked up through the uh looked up to the sweet
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:20.640]  gum leaves into the sunny sky and i just thought about how special and short life is and how good

[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:31.920]  children are and the fact that goodness the goodness on this planet deserves to be defended
