[00:00.000 --> 00:13.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.240 --> 00:22.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.000 --> 00:29.720]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Thursday November 20th
[00:29.720 --> 00:34.720]  2014 it's Revolution Day in Mexico and it looks like it's going to be Revolution
[00:34.720 --> 00:39.000]  Day in America now before I get any letters or calls I know that they
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.520]  celebrated on I think it's the third Monday in November but it was the 1910
[00:43.520 --> 00:48.560]  Mexican Revolution that they have celebrated until 2006 on November 20th
[00:48.560 --> 00:53.120]  is that a coincidence that this is the day that Obama is going to announce
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.280]  blanket amnesty we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson he's got an
[00:57.280 --> 01:01.720]  article up right now on info wars.com he's going to be co-hosting today is
[01:01.720 --> 01:05.680]  Obama trying to cause civil unrest in America of course we see what's
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.840]  happening in Ferguson everybody is on pins and needles awaiting a verdict
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.800]  there we see record gun sales there most of the gun sales we've now heard from a
[01:15.800 --> 01:20.000]  lot of the shops are first-time gun owners people are very concerned about
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.240]  what's going on there we've seen and we've covered this earlier in the week
[01:23.240 --> 01:29.600]  that a police officer posted get a gun to protect yourself we can't do it and
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.200]  of course we've seen that time and time again we're also going to be talking to
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.760]  our Ferguson reporters going to be joining us later in the show as well as
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.280]  Anthony Gucciardi talking about health concerns people that he's talked to
[01:43.280 --> 01:48.000]  concerned that maybe we're not seeing everything that's going on with Ebola
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.120]  we're also going to be talking to Arnold Abbott now he is the 90-year-old man in
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.920]  Florida you may remember a couple of weeks ago it began he had been feeding
[01:57.920 --> 02:03.560]  homeless people in Fort Lauderdale for 23 years they passed a new ordinance
[02:03.560 --> 02:07.840]  saying that he believed that was targeted directly at him and essentially
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.360]  saying that you can't feed people on the street where they live you've got to go
[02:12.360 --> 02:15.240]  into a church building you've got to have a sink you've got to have all these
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.040]  different regulations he believes that it was something that was done by the
[02:19.040 --> 02:22.200]  people the rich people the people in control the government who didn't want
[02:22.200 --> 02:27.560]  to see homeless people on the street he refused on principle to back down to
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.080]  change this I think it's a great example of someone standing up to government
[02:33.080 --> 02:38.440]  when it exceeds its moral authority and I am very anxious to talk to him of
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.800]  course he's a World War two veteran he's going to be joining us later in the
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.120]  show as well now there's a lot of people and we're going to be talking to Paul
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.240]  about this when we come back from break a lot of people have a lot of concerns
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.520]  about what Obama is doing and of course it's typically portrayed as the
[02:54.520 --> 02:58.640]  Republicans are very concerned about this but the Democrats are solidly behind
[02:58.640 --> 03:04.200]  it no there are a lot of Democrats who understand that this is costing them the
[03:04.200 --> 03:09.600]  blue-collar vote amongst whites and blacks the number of people that he is
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.320]  looking at in terms of giving amnesty five million people plus he's saying
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.400]  he's going to give work permits to about another million or so that's all the
[03:17.400 --> 03:23.240]  jobs that have been added since 2009 remember when we had the massive
[03:23.240 --> 03:29.640]  recession depression in 2008 every single job that's been added since then in
[03:29.640 --> 03:32.880]  terms of numbers that would be the number of people that he'd be giving
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.080]  work permits to do we have the kind of economy that can absorb that and of
[03:37.080 --> 03:43.080]  course Obama himself back in 2006 in his own autobiography or perhaps it was
[03:43.080 --> 03:48.240]  ghostwritten but we have him reading his probably ghostwritten autobiography
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.080]  bringing up these exact same points of how it's going to hurt people who have
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.760]  traditionally been the Democrat base many Democrat politicians understand
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.600]  how it's hurt them as they're now out of office so it's not exactly that the
[04:02.600 --> 04:05.480]  Democrats are necessarily a hundred percent behind him certainly the
[04:05.480 --> 04:10.320]  leadership is and the leadership of the Republican Party is solidly behind this
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.360]  regardless of what they tell you because they're doing this for big business
[04:14.360 --> 04:18.880]  they're doing it for the US Chamber of Commerce who wants this to happen they
[04:18.880 --> 04:24.080]  want to deliver for their corporate masters if they didn't if they didn't
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.040]  they could do something to stop it what did they do when they came back from
[04:28.040 --> 04:32.480]  their massive victory in the Republican House after the elections first thing
[04:32.480 --> 04:39.920]  they did was pass the Keystone Pipeline Bill for the ninth time nine times they
[04:39.920 --> 04:43.040]  know it's not going to go anywhere but they'll do it for their corporate masters
[04:43.040 --> 04:46.200]  they won't make a point about Obama breaking the law and acting like an
[04:46.200 --> 04:49.880]  emperor but they'll do it for the Keystone Pipeline because that's what
[04:49.880 --> 04:53.000]  their corporate masters want stay with us we'll be right back with Paul Joseph

[08:15.320 --> 08:24.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday November 20th I'm David
[08:24.560 --> 08:29.240]  Knight and gonna be your host today I'm being joined with Paul Joseph Watson in
[08:29.240 --> 08:34.760]  the UK Paul how you doing good to be here David now we have this article that
[08:34.760 --> 08:39.240]  you put up today is Obama trying to cause civil unrest in America I mean
[08:39.240 --> 08:44.480]  there's a lot of stuff going on right now with the amnesty plans that are
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.720]  going to be announced tonight as part of the Univision coverage I guess of the
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.160]  Latin Grammys they've got it perfectly situated so that the English news
[08:55.160 --> 08:59.120]  channels are not going to be covering it but of course the Latin channels are
[08:59.120 --> 09:02.280]  going to be covering it I'm wondering if have you heard is it going to be in
[09:02.280 --> 09:07.480]  English what even have English subtitles maybe I don't know I mean that's the
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.040]  point David there's a new headline out actually just in the last hour Obama
[09:12.040 --> 09:15.840]  doesn't bother to solicit English-speaking networks for coverage so
[09:15.840 --> 09:20.360]  this is basically apart from the you know the broadcast channels that have
[09:20.360 --> 09:24.000]  chosen to pick this up it's going to be on Univision it's going to be at the
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.200]  Latin Grammys and basically all these immigrant groups are planning parties
[09:28.200 --> 09:32.040]  around it so this is specifically directed at the immigrants it's not
[09:32.040 --> 09:36.560]  directed to the American people which this will affect and as he said I put
[09:36.560 --> 09:40.120]  the article out this morning the sentiments of which were echoed by
[09:40.120 --> 09:45.480]  Phyllis Schlafly who's been a guest on this program before she said Obama could
[09:45.480 --> 09:52.000]  launch another civil war by announcing this amnesty my headline was is Obama
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  trying to cause civil unrest in America and basically I question the timing you
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.080]  know we've got National Guard police FBI across the country warning that this
[10:02.080 --> 10:07.440]  officer Darren Wilson verdict which is set to come down probably tomorrow could
[10:07.440 --> 10:12.720]  cause rioting looting and unrest they're buying riot gear to prepare for it and
[10:12.720 --> 10:18.200]  this could come down tomorrow Obama has chosen to announce this amnesty plan
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.160]  which senator Tom Coburn says could cause the country to quote go nuts could
[10:24.160 --> 10:29.600]  cause anarchy and violence he's chosen to announce it at the exact same time when
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.560]  the FBI when police departments across the country are also warning and
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.320]  preparing for violence in relation to the outcome of the Michael Brown shooting
[10:38.320 --> 10:43.040]  so the timing is absolutely senseless David I mean couldn't they have waited
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.240]  at least a few days to announce this well yeah but you gotta you gotta say
[10:47.240 --> 10:51.240]  trying to polarize the country with coinciding this announcement with the
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.160]  Wilson verdict you gotta understand though Paul this is this is perfect
[10:55.160 --> 10:59.760]  timing for them because today is Revolution Day in Mexico November 10th
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.920]  2019 10 was when the Mexican Revolution started and they have celebrated on
[11:04.920 --> 11:10.040]  November the 20th up until 2006 and they moved it to the third Monday but this
[11:10.040 --> 11:14.200]  is Revolution Day this is when he's appealing to his audience I would
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.840]  imagine that's probably why they have the Latin Grammys on this particular day
[11:18.840 --> 11:24.480]  but nevertheless this is his audience that he is pandering to this is the
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.680]  group that he believes he's going to establish a permanent Democrat majority
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.840]  with that he's going to use to fundamentally transform the country but
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.640]  you know Paul we talk about these executive orders on immigration but
[11:35.640 --> 11:40.080]  there's other executive orders as well coming down the road the Obama
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.600]  administration openly talked about how they were going to move ahead with quote
[11:44.600 --> 11:48.240]  unquote climate change regulation and there wasn't anything that the
[11:48.240 --> 11:51.680]  Republicans could do about it they said that right after the election so we
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.120]  don't care if you've got majorities we're going to move ahead with our own
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.560]  agenda and of course that agenda is shutting down all of our energy resources
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.080]  just as they've shipped our jobs abroad they want to shut down the energy
[12:04.080 --> 12:08.280]  resources as well and the excuse that they're using of course is global warming
[12:08.280 --> 12:12.040]  before we get back to immigration I want people to look at this video that's
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.400]  coming out of Buffalo they're bracing for snow there and even for Buffalo this
[12:16.400 --> 12:21.520]  is an amazing amount of snow let's go to that video Buffalo's deadly monster
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.800]  storm isn't done yet the lake effect storm hammered southern parts of the
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.080]  city Tuesday dumping nearly six feet the region now bracing for round two
[12:31.080 --> 12:36.800]  expected to bring another two to three feet of snow by Friday an entire year
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.680]  worth of snow in just days this snowfall may break all sorts of records the
[12:42.680 --> 12:46.640]  city in a state of emergency and residents struggling to dig out from
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.720]  under walls of snow it's too much it's just really a lot of snow here and it's
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.560]  hard to we're closed in here it's not an open area we can just fling the snow
[12:54.560 --> 13:00.440]  anyway trapped inside his West Seneca home James Grimaldi used an aerial drone
[13:00.440 --> 13:05.520]  to escape his snow-covered garage capturing this video of the avalanche of
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.280]  snow left behind driving bands in a major roadways throughout the area
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.880]  remain at a standstill after stranded drivers were forced to abandon their
[13:16.880 --> 13:23.960]  snow-buried cars and trucks officials say it could be days before the highways
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.520]  are cleared in our warning residents to be careful stay home if you do have to
[13:29.520 --> 13:34.720]  go out please exercise caution in the hardest hit areas where snow is too
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.520]  deep for plows crews have had to bring in front-end loaders and dump trucks to
[13:39.520 --> 13:43.760]  haul the snow out the National Guard out in full force to help clear the
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.640]  streets while EMS and firefighters are depending on volunteers with snowmobiles
[13:48.640 --> 13:54.160]  or venturing out on foot to rescue those stranded and in need the storm now
[13:54.160 --> 13:59.520]  claiming seven lives some from cardiac arrest shoveling others simply trapped
[13:59.520 --> 14:05.800]  in the cold that's an amazing story and they're expecting another 20 to 30 more
[14:05.800 --> 14:10.640]  inches of snow they said today during a 10-hour window but it's not just Buffalo
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.840]  Buffalo has this kind of weather I mean but still 20 to 30 inches that's an
[14:15.840 --> 14:20.200]  amazing amount of snow anywhere but Buffalo does get a lot of snow but
[14:20.200 --> 14:24.560]  it's not just Buffalo they say that 50% of the US has snow on the ground as of
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.920]  Tuesday according to the National Weather Service all 50 states have
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.520]  registered temperatures below freezing Tuesday morning even traditionally warm
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.440]  ones it's been very cold here in Austin Texas as well Paul I know you were just
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.620]  here not too long ago but they had the meteorological society the American
[14:40.620 --> 14:46.440]  Meteorological Society meet here in Austin I think it was in 2013 or maybe
[14:46.440 --> 14:49.840]  it was earlier this year anyway it was in the spring and the guys who are the
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.360]  weathermen have pretty accurate models and that's really what they were doing
[14:53.360 --> 14:56.720]  it was kind of a trade and science meeting where they were exchanging
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.200]  information back and forth about their models they could immediately see whether
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.200]  or not they were true they could test that but the people who are predicting
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.800]  long-term climate change have been predicting it based on a rise in CO2
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.400]  and even though we've seen the rise in CO2 we've seen global temperatures
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.760]  dropping their models don't work even in the short term they don't work but it
[15:17.760 --> 15:21.760]  makes it very difficult Paul to look at these models when they're predicting
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.240]  things that are decades out because it's difficult for you to they you
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.920]  basically can't just prove their models and they say we don't have to prove it
[15:29.920 --> 15:33.920]  because we are arguing from a position of authority we're a professor we're a
[15:33.920 --> 15:39.040]  client a climate scientist so you just should listen to us and do what we say
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.760]  yeah and then the models that they did predict back in the 70s a lot of these
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.840]  people who are linked to advisors in the White House like John P. Holdren and
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.040]  Paul Ehrlich who co-authored Eco Science you know they were saying a new
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.560]  ice age back in the 70s they were proven spectacularly wrong time and time again
[15:56.560 --> 16:02.080]  what we do know as you mentioned is that since the past about around 18 and a
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.960]  half years ago there's been no measurable global warming whatsoever now you
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.600]  will get a story like it's the hottest October ever in the world which some
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.520]  scientific bodies are claiming they cite that as evidence of global warming
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.440]  when it's no more than evidence of weather but then when you forward something
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.760]  like look at this record snow November looks like being one of the coldest
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.480]  months ever certainly in the United States and they say well that's just the
[16:28.480 --> 16:32.760]  weather that's not indicative of long-term climate models so either way you
[16:32.760 --> 16:37.360]  can't win with those people but when you do go back two decades there's no
[16:37.360 --> 16:41.560]  noticeable change in global warming so they cherry-picked the evidence they
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.880]  want to believe it's confirmation bias that backs up their fear-mongering their
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.520]  hysteria about climate change while Al Gore buys you know ocean side mansions
[16:51.520 --> 16:56.000]  and uses God knows how many multiples the amount of electricity as the average
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.680]  American so they're complete hypocrites and they've been proven spectacularly
[17:00.680 --> 17:05.400]  wrong time and time again yeah when we were there even though the long-term
[17:05.400 --> 17:09.240]  climate data over about a 17-year period was showing a global decline in
[17:09.240 --> 17:12.840]  temperatures they were trumpeting the fact that in the United States it had
[17:12.840 --> 17:16.240]  been an increase in the last year so you can pick where you measure the
[17:16.240 --> 17:19.440]  temperature you can pick the time frame that you measure the temperature to try
[17:19.440 --> 17:23.600]  to cherry-pick those data but I think that the real data shows that there isn't
[17:23.600 --> 17:28.120]  any correlation and they believe that too there was a George Soros organization
[17:28.120 --> 17:31.120]  that was there the only political organization I saw and they were lobbing
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.640]  very hard for the weathermen to get on board with climate change saying you can
[17:35.640 --> 17:40.560]  shape opinion and isn't it astounding that most weathermen don't believe in
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.560]  global warming but I also want to talk about this agreement that they made and
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.100]  this is what it's going to look like with Obama's mandates and dictates in this
[17:49.100 --> 17:54.320]  area shutting down the coal industry shutting down energy now when he made
[17:54.320 --> 17:57.560]  this agreement with China here's what the agreement looks like we have to
[17:57.560 --> 18:03.200]  reduce the United States has to reduce our energy usage by 25% over the next
[18:03.200 --> 18:09.520]  11 years but China is free to grow their energy usage for the next 16 years
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.640]  before they cap it you understand we have to decline where we are in 11 years
[18:14.640 --> 18:19.080]  they will be able to grow and wherever they are in 16 years they'll be able to
[18:19.080 --> 18:24.600]  cap it now if it's global warming shouldn't we be concerned about new
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.320]  possibly very dirty Chinese power plants that are being opened in that interim
[18:29.320 --> 18:33.200]  say they're not concerned about the global warming aspect of it they just
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.080]  want to shut down our energy and and Paul that gets us back to this immigration
[18:37.080 --> 18:43.120]  thing this is really a clowered and piven strategy this is not only bringing in a
[18:43.120 --> 18:49.000]  different demographic group and giving them the jobs but it's also something
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.360]  that is going to swell the welfare roles it's going to swell the medical
[18:52.360 --> 18:57.120]  expenses here it is a clowered and piven strategy this is something that social
[18:57.120 --> 19:02.080]  scientists talked about centuries ago the Tocqueville talked about it it's
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.000]  sometimes attributed to another fellow but basically you know you we've all
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.920]  heard it that democracy will only exist until people realize that they can vote
[19:09.920 --> 19:15.040]  themselves money out of the Treasury at which point it will collapse clowered
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.800]  and piven kind of formalize that and said let's help that collapse along let's
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.680]  build an unsupportable welfare state very quickly so that we can then collapse
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.080]  it that's what I believe is really behind this yeah and it's it's like you
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.920]  know Bill Clinton said how do you need an elephant won by a time when he was
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.000]  referring to gun control initially these immigrants aren't going to get some of
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.440]  the benefits they're not going to be covered by Obamacare but once they get
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.640]  that work permit or that resident status then that's the next stage it's a
[19:43.640 --> 19:47.760]  stepping stone process and it's not just Republicans that are saying that this is
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.280]  unconstitutional but it's hang on oh we gotta come up to a break we're gonna be

[23:59.520 --> 24:20.280]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight live in the studio I have
[24:20.280 --> 24:24.560]  Paul Joseph Watson joining us from London it is Thursday November 20th
[24:24.560 --> 24:29.840]  Revolution Day for Mexico the day their revolution began and presumably the day
[24:29.840 --> 24:34.640]  that Obama wants to begin the revolution in America he promised to
[24:34.640 --> 24:38.240]  fundamentally transform this country looks like he's going to do it we were
[24:38.240 --> 24:44.480]  talking Paul and I were just talking about his announced intention to do
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.680]  whatever he wishes on climate change saying that even Republican majorities
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.920]  in Congress aren't going to stop him and of course today is the day that he's
[24:54.920 --> 25:00.200]  going to announce what he's going to do with five million illegal immigrants at
[25:00.200 --> 25:04.600]  least perhaps many more will be joining those ranks and I was just talking to
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.600]  Paul we just began talking about executive orders on immigration go ahead
[25:08.600 --> 25:12.920]  Paul we had to go to a commercial break yeah I was just making the point that a
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.920]  lot of this opposition you know for example Ted Cruz calling Obama a
[25:16.920 --> 25:22.000]  monarch for utilizing these executive orders unconstitutionally a lot of it's
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.360]  come from Republicans but if you actually look at what Obama said
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.360]  himself last year I mean listen to this Obama noted that granting a
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.000]  unilateral amnesty for adults residing in our country illegally was quote not
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.080]  an option because it would amount to quote ignoring the law and on the flip
[25:40.080 --> 25:45.800]  side in 2011 Obama said there are laws on the books that Congress has passed and
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.080]  therefore it would not be permissible for the president to quote suspend
[25:49.080 --> 25:55.040]  deportations through executive order so on two separate occasions Obama admitted
[25:55.040 --> 26:01.200]  the enacting immigration policy through executive order was quote ignoring the
[26:01.200 --> 26:07.680]  law was unconstitutional and was illegal so by his own admission with this
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.520]  executive order set to come down tomorrow Obama is completely violating
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.480]  the law so it's not just Republicans that are accusing him of this in his own
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.920]  words he said that that would be the case as recently as last year and now
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.040]  that's exactly what he's doing he's very well of that well aware of that he
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.600]  knows that he's betraying his base and this is something I think this is
[26:28.600 --> 26:33.560]  really Paul crossing the Rubicon you know it was it's not just a political
[26:33.560 --> 26:39.040]  aspect it's also a legal constitutional aspect it has economic aspects it has
[26:39.040 --> 26:44.240]  social aspects he wants to fundamentally transform this country and one of
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.520]  those ways is to say that hey I waited six months I waited a year I didn't get
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.720]  what I wanted out of the democratic process of the constitutional process so
[26:53.720 --> 26:58.640]  I'm just going to put out an edict I'm gonna do whatever I wish because I'm
[26:58.640 --> 27:03.040]  I'm tired of waiting I'm frustrated because I'm not getting the results I
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.840]  want essentially he is acting as a dictator over and over again and we're
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.920]  gonna see this followed up with a shutdown of our energy resources as well
[27:12.920 --> 27:16.400]  when he starts on these climate change mandates it isn't going to stop here
[27:16.400 --> 27:22.160]  he's establishing a precedent and the GOP is not doing anything to stop him all
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.920]  they're doing up to this point is they're just saying that they're going to sue
[27:26.920 --> 27:31.200]  him in court that's not the rightful remedy the rightful remedy is for them
[27:31.200 --> 27:38.000]  to pass laws or to impeach this guy well that would be the rightful cost
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.080]  because we've got to remember Obama's rap sheet for impeachment is as long as my
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.360]  arm I mean you know Benghazi you know aiding terrorists in Syria fast and
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.000]  furious undermining the authority of Congress with regards to the attack on
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.200]  Libya he's already up for all these different charges under impeachment now
[27:55.200 --> 27:59.440]  this but the Republicans the establishment Republicans aren't going to
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.480]  impeach Obama because they know that that would expend all their political
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.880]  capital and they fear that Hillary Clinton will then seize on that and use
[28:08.880 --> 28:13.960]  that as a launchpad to become president in 2016 as he said that's the only way
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.680]  that a precedent could be set that a president cannot continually violate
[28:18.680 --> 28:23.360]  the Constitution issue executive orders throw a tantrum when he doesn't get his
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.760]  way act like an authoritarian dictator absolutely running through this
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.680]  amnesty and it's not going to stop at four five million the US citizenship and
[28:32.680 --> 28:39.600]  immigration services last month issued a solicitation for 34 million blank green
[28:39.600 --> 28:44.920]  cards yeah 34 million yeah so this is not gonna stop at four five million and
[28:44.920 --> 28:47.600]  eventually they're gonna get the welfare they're gonna get the benefits
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.840]  they're gonna be covered under Obamacare and eventually it's going to be
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.800]  everyone spending the message that if you can get there illegally you can
[28:54.800 --> 28:58.700]  become a citizen which opens up the floodgates to all kind of social
[28:58.700 --> 29:03.600]  economic horrors down the line it's not just that you're losing your job if you
[29:03.600 --> 29:08.080]  are a white and black blue collar worker or even professionals they are
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.920]  going to put people on the welfare role as well as putting people on the job
[29:12.920 --> 29:16.960]  rolls that's a huge part of this but you know Paul when I look at the excuses
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.320]  that we hear from the GOP of course they're saying we can't pass this because
[29:21.320 --> 29:27.080]  it won't get any farther than the house and yet they have passed the keystone
[29:27.080 --> 29:31.240]  pipeline nine times they've passed it knowing that it isn't going to get
[29:31.240 --> 29:34.960]  through the Senate knowing that it would get a veto on Obama's desk and yet
[29:34.960 --> 29:39.520]  they find a way to do that they need to stand up and do the right thing and take
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.720]  the consequences take it to the to the metal we're gonna be right back with Paul
[29:43.720 --> 29:53.960]  Joseph Watson stay with us we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[33:44.240 --> 33:47.680]  we've been out of for a while but now we've got it back in supply it's very
[33:47.680 --> 33:51.240]  difficult to get it in and the kind of concentrations that we make it and it's
[33:51.240 --> 33:56.000]  very dangerous and difficult to create it could run out pretty soon it's going
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.080]  to take another six weeks to get it in so I get some right now while we've got
[34:00.080 --> 34:05.040]  it why it's difficult is because we make it in this high concentration 30 parts

[34:53.680 --> 34:58.840]  again we've got it back in stock right now it's just a limited supply Paul we
[34:58.840 --> 35:03.400]  were talking just before the break about Obama acting like a dictator acting like
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.760]  an emperor and of course he's doing it on Revolution Day in Mexico that was a
[35:08.760 --> 35:12.760]  day they actually over through their were emperor I guess he's he's kind of
[35:12.760 --> 35:18.360]  taking it in the opposite way he's trying to overthrow our social economic
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.840]  legal system so that he can essentially become an emperor but it's not something
[35:21.840 --> 35:26.840]  that they run from I want to play this clip from CNN and get your comments on
[35:26.840 --> 35:31.880]  it this is Obama saying that being called actually a spokesperson saying
[35:31.880 --> 35:35.760]  that being called an emperor is a criticism that the president wears with
[35:35.760 --> 35:48.400]  a badge of honor here's that clip
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.520]  however others have said that it isn't necessary for the president to take this
[35:52.520 --> 35:59.200]  action maybe to push Congress to go ahead and prove some type of immigration
[35:59.200 --> 36:07.040]  reform is that the purpose of him part of it taking this step and taking action
[36:07.040 --> 36:11.080]  in trying to protect or fix what he says is wrong with the immigration system
[36:11.080 --> 36:15.440]  well I'll say a couple things about the quote I happen to see that too I mean the
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.320]  thing that there are a couple things that stuck out to me the first is you know
[36:18.320 --> 36:22.240]  again we'll have an ample opportunity to discuss the legal basis for the
[36:22.240 --> 36:27.440]  president's executive actions once he's announced them you know that we've heard
[36:27.440 --> 36:31.240]  this kind of rhetoric about lawlessness from the House Republicans for some time
[36:31.240 --> 36:34.960]  I know that their most recent statement referred to Emperor Obama you know the
[36:34.960 --> 36:38.400]  fact of the matter is you know the president is somebody who's willing to
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.400]  examine the law review the law and use every element of that law to make
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.040]  progress for the American people and that is and if that is something that
[36:46.040 --> 36:49.080]  Republicans are critical of that's you know maybe a criticism that the
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.040]  president wears with up with a badge of honor I think so what do you say to that
[36:53.040 --> 36:59.120]  Paul well I mean Obama himself said again about you know I'm not a king I'm
[36:59.120 --> 37:01.960]  the head of the executive branch of government I'm required to follow the
[37:01.960 --> 37:08.200]  law now the tact has changed somewhat and again the press secretary there says
[37:08.200 --> 37:12.720]  you know fix it for the benefit of the American people the clear majority of
[37:12.720 --> 37:18.440]  Americans oppose this amnesty plan even almost half of Latino was opposed it
[37:18.440 --> 37:22.960]  fact there was an NBC poll which came out just yesterday and they had to try and
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.240]  discredit their own poll by saying it wasn't a large enough sample size
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.880]  because almost half of Latinos they asked actually opposed Obama's executive
[37:32.880 --> 37:37.400]  agenda on amnesty so he's not acting in the best interest of the American
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.360]  people by any stretch of the imagination he was fundamentally rejected by them
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.040]  in the recent mid-term election and then as you mentioned before there's a
[37:46.040 --> 37:50.440]  social aspect you know all these sheriffs have come out over the past 24
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.640]  hours and said that this is going to be a green light a welcoming beacon for
[37:55.640 --> 37:59.600]  criminals to flood into the United States because obviously a lot of the
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.680]  illegal immigrants have a large criminal element along them amongst them and
[38:03.680 --> 38:07.520]  this is gonna this is gonna start to gradually tear apart the fabric of
[38:07.520 --> 38:13.560]  American society as it has in Europe and I can speak on the subject from that
[38:13.560 --> 38:18.600]  perspective living here and even David Cameron and Angela Merkel the German
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.760]  Chancellor have acknowledged that state-imposed multiculturalism through
[38:23.760 --> 38:27.800]  mass uncontrolled immigration which is what many European countries have
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.640]  overseen doesn't work it's a complete failure because a lot of these immigrants
[38:33.640 --> 38:37.840]  don't wish to assimilate they have their own culture which they want to reinforce
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.840]  and it's often hostile to the native culture so that's not right wing
[38:42.840 --> 38:46.680]  political groups that have said that multiculturalism doesn't work in Europe
[38:46.680 --> 38:52.480]  heads of state have acknowledged that it hasn't worked and it's led to social
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.640]  disparity it's led to riots in places like Sweden in Stockholm France in
[38:57.640 --> 39:02.160]  Paris and the UK of course back in 2011 and I mean if you look at Sweden which
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.960]  had has completely thrown its doors wide open to illegal immigration now they
[39:07.960 --> 39:13.640]  have a situation where Swedish paramedics need body armor to enter
[39:13.640 --> 39:19.520]  Muslim areas of Sweden because these gangs these Muslim gangs have taken
[39:19.520 --> 39:25.120]  over 55 areas in Sweden these major metropolitan areas which are now being
[39:25.120 --> 39:30.960]  designated as no-go zones the government is now even debating whether to cut off
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.960]  services to these zones because whenever the police go in there for any
[39:34.960 --> 39:39.680]  reason whatsoever they're attacked with machetes and other weapons and it's a
[39:39.680 --> 39:45.280]  massive massive problem Sweden has the highest rape rate in Europe as the
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.800]  second highest in the world double the number of rapes compared to America and
[39:50.800 --> 39:56.280]  and a lot of them are being carried out by these Muslim rape gangs which people
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.720]  are scared to talk about in Sweden because it's such a you know a liberal
[40:00.720 --> 40:08.360]  utopia that in the first seven months of 2013 over 1,000 Swedish women reported
[40:08.360 --> 40:14.480]  being raped by these Muslim gangs in the city of Stockholm alone also 300 of
[40:14.480 --> 40:19.960]  those cases were girls under the age of 15 we've seen a huge we've seen a huge
[40:19.960 --> 40:23.760]  increase in crime here a John bound did a report on it in North Carolina they
[40:23.760 --> 40:27.680]  had somebody who was tracking it and of course they don't like to report that the
[40:27.680 --> 40:32.280]  crime was committed by somebody who is an illegal alien but they went back and
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.000]  they were able to look closely at the records they found hundreds of cases as
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.080]  you point out of sexual assault many of them from under it on underage girls at
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.640]  the time this is something that they're working very hard to cover up and Paul
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.280]  this is something is very different in the American experience I mean many of
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.920]  us have friends and relatives who came over in the Ellis Island experiment we
[40:53.920 --> 40:57.920]  always talk about the American melting pot those people who came over in those
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.840]  waves of immigration were coming to America because they believed in what
[41:01.840 --> 41:07.120]  America stood for it wasn't merely an escape valve it wasn't merely for
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.040]  economic purposes but they really bought into the vision the culture the
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.840]  legal situation here in the US they wanted to be a part of it that's what
[41:15.840 --> 41:19.120]  we called it a melting pot today as somebody has pointed out it's really
[41:19.120 --> 41:24.040]  more of a a tossed salad the groups come in in very large numbers they remain
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.680]  distinct they remain separate they wish to keep their culture separate but it's
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.840]  even more than that there's kind of a cultural imperialism a resentment of
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.880]  America as we see from these groups like La Raza they seek to establish their
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.600]  own independent state their own independent culture legal system we've
[41:42.600 --> 41:46.880]  seen that with the Muslims as well in Europe Obama himself understood this
[41:46.880 --> 41:51.400]  listen to this quote this is reported on this earlier this week the flashback
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.040]  with the quotes out of Obama's book in 2006 that he had somebody ghostright for
[41:57.040 --> 42:01.400]  him and he was reading it in the audio tape he said native-born Americans
[42:01.400 --> 42:06.240]  suspect that it is they and not the immigrant who are being forced to adapt
[42:06.240 --> 42:10.120]  to social changes caused by migration that's Obama saying that and then he
[42:10.120 --> 42:13.520]  goes on to say if I'm honest with myself I must admit that I'm not entirely
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.720]  immune to such nativist sentiments when I see Mexican flags waved at pro
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.600]  immigration demonstrations I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.880]  when I'm forced to use a translator to communicate with a guy fixing my car I
[42:27.880 --> 42:33.360]  feel a certain frustration he's speaking to what people understand and that is
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.360]  there is no desire to assimilate to to be a part of this legal system they want
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.040]  to come here and change it and that's why Obama is bringing them here even
[42:44.040 --> 42:49.800]  though he said this he wants to use them as a tool of social change as a tool of
[42:49.800 --> 42:56.120]  disruption what do you think about that Paul are you there did we lose you now
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.400]  I mean yeah and I mean that point is exemplified perfectly if you read
[43:00.400 --> 43:04.640]  Dinesh D'Souza's America imagine a world without her as he said the original wave
[43:04.640 --> 43:08.440]  of immigrants they wanted to come over they were escaping despotic regimes in
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.080]  many cases they wanted to work hard they wanted to build businesses now it's a
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.120]  completely different equation these people just as happened in Europe over
[43:17.120 --> 43:21.240]  the past several decades they're coming across to get welfare they're coming
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.760]  across to be exploited to be used as a voting block for the Democratic Party
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.680]  there are a ton of hard-working Mexicans now living in America that have built
[43:30.680 --> 43:35.200]  businesses that have invested themselves in the American dream that have
[43:35.200 --> 43:38.560]  achieved the American dream to a great extent which is why as I said earlier
[43:38.560 --> 43:43.200]  nearly half of Latinos oppose Obama's executive amnesty because they can
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.120]  differentiate between genuine skilled hard-working immigrants that want to
[43:47.120 --> 43:51.200]  contribute to the society they want to assimilate not ones that are an invasive
[43:51.200 --> 43:56.320]  force the Marie conquist of the Aztlan types that want to come in and reinforce
[43:56.320 --> 44:00.840]  their own culture and then be hostile to the native culture that's already there
[44:00.840 --> 44:04.920]  whether that be white Americans black Americans Mexican Americans whoever
[44:04.920 --> 44:08.880]  people who are already invested in the system who have built businesses so it's
[44:08.880 --> 44:14.160]  not an issue of race it never has been it's an issue of economics the social
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.600]  fabric of the country and Obama knows that even though he admitted in his book
[44:18.600 --> 44:22.560]  like he said you know even I'm uncomfortable with the guy fixing my
[44:22.560 --> 44:26.760]  car can't speak English so even he acknowledged it now he appears to have
[44:26.760 --> 44:30.720]  completely thrown any of those concerns about the window and is acting as Ted
[44:30.720 --> 44:35.720]  Cruz like a monarch yeah let's let's play a quote from that book let's play
[44:35.720 --> 44:40.240]  that first quote guys here about the effect on blue collar workers because I
[44:40.240 --> 44:44.400]  think this speaks to exactly the sort of thing that you were just talking about
[44:44.400 --> 44:49.640]  Paul it's it's whites it's blacks it's Mexicans who have come here legally and
[44:49.640 --> 44:54.960]  immigrated who are now working in perhaps many cases blue collar jobs
[44:54.960 --> 44:59.160]  they're the ones who are going to be displaced in many cases by the number
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.560]  of people coming in it's going to put pressure on the economic sector where
[45:02.560 --> 45:07.400]  they work let's listen to what he had to say this is Obama in 2006 there's no
[45:07.400 --> 45:11.800]  denying that many blacks share the same anxieties as many whites about the wave
[45:11.800 --> 45:17.040]  of illegal immigration flooding our southern border there you go yeah he
[45:17.040 --> 45:20.880]  says a sense that what's happening is fundamentally different than what's gone
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.760]  on before but again it's not just whites and blacks as you pointed out Paul this
[45:25.760 --> 45:30.240]  is something that affects everybody who is here legally there's a article that's
[45:30.240 --> 45:33.680]  up on info wars.com today Obama's amnesty will add as many foreign
[45:33.680 --> 45:39.600]  workers as new jobs since 2009 Obama's unilateral amnesty will quickly add as
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.320]  many foreign workers to the nation's legal labor labor force as a total
[45:43.320 --> 45:48.120]  number created since 2009 it will also create a new inflow of foreign college
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.640]  graduates for prestigious salaries and jobs according to press reports and they
[45:52.640 --> 45:57.360]  point out that he has already provided or promised almost a million extra work
[45:57.360 --> 46:01.160]  permits to foreigners while his this economy has added only six million jobs
[46:01.160 --> 46:06.680]  since 2009 so there you go that wipes out all the gains whether you're white
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.560]  black or Hispanic that wipes out all the gains but he is also and we see this in
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.360]  Ferguson this is a big part of what's going on in Ferguson. Ferguson has in
[46:16.360 --> 46:21.080]  many cases a police problem just as we have seen across this country in many
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.920]  cases that police problem is stemming from rules of engagement that are being
[46:24.920 --> 46:29.280]  that are coming out of Washington and in response to that however instead of
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.160]  addressing those what they do is they pit one ethnic group against another and
[46:34.160 --> 46:37.440]  that's what we're seeing happening in Ferguson as well they use this to pit
[46:37.440 --> 46:40.840]  one ethnic group against the other so they can divide and conquer the
[46:40.840 --> 46:46.600]  population. Yeah I mean with the jobs issue it goes back even further it goes
[46:46.600 --> 46:51.720]  back to the year 2000. Now there are less Native Americans with jobs now in
[46:51.720 --> 46:58.600]  2014 than there were in 2000 yet there are 5.7 million immigrants with jobs.
[46:58.600 --> 47:05.320]  All the employment growth not since 2009 but way back 2014 years ago have gone
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.400]  to immigrants despite the fact that population growth in the United States
[47:09.400 --> 47:13.560]  two-thirds of that is Native born Americans so it's not the fact that
[47:13.560 --> 47:16.960]  they've just overwhelmed the numbers it's the fact that most of those jobs
[47:16.960 --> 47:20.760]  have gone to immigrants because of course they're more inclined to accept a
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.880]  lower wage that benefits big business which the Republicans as well as the
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.120]  Democrats are in league with. So that goes back even further than he's being
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.920]  reported today. I think that big business aspect is a huge part of why
[47:34.920 --> 47:39.640]  nothing is really being done by the GOP because the US Chamber of Commerce the
[47:39.640 --> 47:44.760]  Walmarts the big corporations they very badly want the cheapest labor they can
[47:44.760 --> 47:48.840]  find they want to flood the market with labor because that's going to drive
[47:48.840 --> 47:53.560]  down the price of labor. You know Bernie Sanders who is a he calls himself an
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.280]  independent he calls himself a socialist he always caucuses with the
[47:56.280 --> 47:59.360]  Democrats he's saying that he's thinking about running for the White House so
[47:59.360 --> 48:04.760]  of course he wants to distance himself from this very very unpopular policy
[48:04.760 --> 48:09.360]  with Democrats as we just saw in the last election he says that the Democrat
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.160]  party that working white working class white voters have abandoned Democrats
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.360]  in large numbers he said the party has not made it clear that they're prepared
[48:18.360 --> 48:21.880]  to stand with the working class people this country and take on the big money
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.480]  interests and that's precisely the point that's what these the GOP
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.040]  leadership like Boehner are doing they're sucking up to the US Chamber of
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.640]  Commerce just as they did with the Keystone Pipeline whether or not you
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.280]  agree with the Keystone Pipeline I think it's probably on balance I would
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.480]  support it nevertheless they have gone to bat for that nine times having a vote
[48:44.480 --> 48:47.320]  that they know that isn't going to go anywhere they do that to show their
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.760]  loyalty to their corporate masters that is the only thing the Republicans have
[48:51.760 --> 48:54.200]  done since they've come back it's the first thing they've done since they
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.960]  come back has passed that and of course it was pronounced dead on arrival in the
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.280]  still democratically controlled Senate nevertheless they will do that but they
[49:01.280 --> 49:06.520]  won't pass any legislation to stop Obama's amnesty they won't pass any
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.920]  regulation to really do something about immigration at the borders and they're
[49:10.920 --> 49:15.520]  not going to do anything to try to impeach Obama well I mean there's a
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.160]  definite split isn't there I mean the likes of Michelle Bachman she's on her
[49:19.160 --> 49:23.120]  way out it's only really the likes of Ted Cruz that are even mentioning
[49:23.120 --> 49:26.560]  impeachment the rest of the establishment Republicans distanced
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.680]  themselves from that almost immediately after the midterm so we know that when
[49:30.680 --> 49:34.840]  push comes to shove they will side with the Democrats arm-in-arm you know they're
[49:34.840 --> 49:37.800]  both on the same side of the same establishment so they're not going to
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.760]  push for genuine change now they're not going to genuinely oppose Obama they're
[49:41.760 --> 49:44.640]  going to forgive him for all his transgressions once he's out of office
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.720]  just as Obama did for Bush yeah let's play a little bit of what Ted Cruz said
[49:48.720 --> 49:52.840]  on Fox News are you talking about how he's pushing back against it but let's
[49:52.840 --> 49:58.080]  play that guys we are unfortunately witnessing a constitutional crisis what
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.560]  President Obama is doing is he is defying the law he's defying the
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.560]  Constitution you know the president quite rightly said just a few weeks ago
[50:05.560 --> 50:10.400]  his policies were on the ballot all over the country this last election was a
[50:10.400 --> 50:15.000]  referendum on amnesty and the American people overwhelmingly rose up and said
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.320]  no we don't want lawless amnesty and I'm sorry to say President Obama's reaction
[50:21.320 --> 50:28.280]  is is defiant and it is angry with the American people and if the president goes
[50:28.280 --> 50:33.080]  forward with this if he goes forward unilaterally defying the Congress
[50:33.080 --> 50:37.240]  elected by the people defying the American voters then it's incumbent on
[50:37.240 --> 50:42.800]  Republicans in Congress to use every single constitutional tool we have to
[50:42.800 --> 50:47.120]  defend the rule of law to reign in a president so that the president does not
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.120]  become an unaccountable monarch imposing his own policies in defiance of the
[50:53.120 --> 50:56.160]  American people this is a moment of testing yeah it's really we're gonna be
[50:56.160 --> 51:00.360]  right back with Paul Joseph Watson stay with us that was Ted Cruz are you

[54:11.680 --> 54:15.360]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin and we're joined
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.600]  with Paul Joseph Watson in the UK now just as we were going out we were talking
[54:20.600 --> 54:26.720]  about we had we played a clip of Ted Cruz essentially saying that what Obama is
[54:26.720 --> 54:32.200]  doing with this unilateral amnesty is essentially in defiance of the American
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.680]  people and what they just said at the polls but earlier we played a clip from
[54:37.680 --> 54:41.480]  press secretary Josh Ernest and he said you know a lot of people have called
[54:41.480 --> 54:48.680]  Obama an emperor but he's just trying to do progress for the American people now
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.200]  when you're giving blanket amnesty and opening the borders to everyone to come
[54:54.200 --> 54:57.800]  into this country to foreigners to come into this country to swamp this
[54:57.800 --> 55:03.560]  country with a massive amount of people that is not for the American people he's
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.680]  ignoring what the American people said he's doing it for people who are not
[55:07.680 --> 55:12.280]  citizens of this country trying to change the demographics of this country
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.480]  into something that will favor him but that hasn't worked so far and there are
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.720]  politicians like Bernie Sanders even the socialist who looks to be running for
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.720]  Democrat in the next election it looks like he's going to announce for that and
[55:25.720 --> 55:31.320]  he was saying that that the working-class people blue-collar people
[55:31.320 --> 55:36.720]  realize that the Democrats have betrayed them on this issue and they're the
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.160]  ones who are going to suffer the most Paul well exactly as we were saying
[55:41.160 --> 55:45.360]  before the break this is going to harm legal immigrants that have already got
[55:45.360 --> 55:49.440]  into the country off their own back off their own hard work they've gone through
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.120]  the administrative procedure and now those who are trying to immigrate
[55:54.120 --> 55:58.840]  legally are going to be pushed right to the back of the line because of this
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.560]  this new move by Obama to legalize these four to five million illegal immigrants
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.600]  so the people who have gone through that sweat and toil to legally immigrate to
[56:07.600 --> 56:12.160]  the country they're going to be punished just as much as the ones legally
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.080]  waiting to immigrate can be punished as are the American people the native
[56:16.080 --> 56:21.080]  population so this is going to harm everybody yeah I think it really does
[56:21.080 --> 56:24.520]  underscore the fact that this is something that is not being done for
[56:24.520 --> 56:27.760]  the American people and of course if he if he really cared what the American
[56:27.760 --> 56:33.040]  people wanted he would listen to their elected representatives or look at the
[56:33.040 --> 56:37.240]  recent election but of course Obama is now a lame duck president he's not going
[56:37.240 --> 56:40.360]  to be running for anything anymore so this is where the teeth are really
[56:40.360 --> 56:44.200]  going to come out this is where we're first going to see this executive order
[56:44.200 --> 56:47.800]  then we're going to see executive orders that are going to have tremendous
[56:47.800 --> 56:52.400]  impact on our lifestyle on our standard of living when he shuts down our energy
[56:52.400 --> 56:56.360]  in the name of climate change but I think it underscores to me the fact that
[56:56.360 --> 57:00.400]  this is something that is being done against the American people and in
[57:00.400 --> 57:05.560]  favor of people who are foreigners the fact that he's putting this on this
[57:05.560 --> 57:07.920]  announcement that's going to be made tonight where he's going to lay out his
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.040]  plans of course it's going to only be carried by the Latin speaking channels
[57:12.040 --> 57:15.440]  the English speaking channels the major networks none of them are going to
[57:15.440 --> 57:20.840]  cover it tonight Paul well exactly in longer term what this is going to do is
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.920]  the Democrats are basically going to whip up this fervor this fight between
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.480]  themselves and the Republicans they're going to shut down the government again
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.160]  in all likelihood that will then be blamed on the intransigent Republicans
[57:33.160 --> 57:38.760]  Hillary Clinton will then blame all these problems on the Republicans because
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.040]  of course they've got control of the House and Senate now that will give her
[57:42.040 --> 57:48.000]  at least some credence some platform to build on going into 2016 because at the
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.160]  moment she's got absolutely nothing and their articles just recently about how
[57:52.160 --> 57:56.600]  she's backed by big business and Wall Street you know if you think Obama was
[57:56.600 --> 58:00.240]  bad wait until you see Hillary Clinton but she's going to use this as a
[58:00.240 --> 58:06.280]  platform to spring her 2016 campaign into action by blaming the government
[58:06.280 --> 58:10.720]  shutdown which is likely to emerge out of this fight on the Republicans on this
[58:10.720 --> 58:14.320]  immigration issue. Say right there Paul Paul is going to be with us for the entire
[58:14.320 --> 58:17.360]  show we're going to be joined in the next segment with Anthony Gucciardi our

[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:20.600]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:30.280]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight joined Paul
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.520]  Joseph Watson in the UK he's our co-host today we've been talking about
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.520]  Emperor Obama of course Alex Jones has been calling him Emperor Obama for a
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.280]  long time it's not a joke anymore as Alex would say it is now literally
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.200]  Emperor Obama because you know we use these things metaphorically but
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.000]  unfortunately these things are truly coming true we have someone who doesn't
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.480]  care about the election that was just a couple of weeks ago he doesn't care that
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:05.400]  his own party took a massive beating at the polls because he's betraying the
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.680]  blue class the blue class the blue collar working class that is his base
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:15.760]  he's betraying them by bringing in a massive amount of people with jobs
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.680]  equivalent to the number of jobs have been a quote been created since 2009
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.720]  essentially a massive amount of competition for those who are at the
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.080]  lower end of the income scale so they've abandoned the party in mass he can't
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.920]  get his legislative agenda through with elected representatives of the people
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.840]  he doesn't care that the people have spoken he's just tired of waiting so
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.200]  he's going to run through his own agenda by executive order and it's not just
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.440]  immigration next up of course is going to be quote unquote climate change where
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.400]  he's going to shut down our energy as well see China gets our jobs and they
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.040]  get our energy but we have to shut it down in the United States that's
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.000]  essentially the agreement that Obama made with China now Paul I want to talk a
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.120]  little bit about essentially the way that they're rolling this out a way that
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.000]  they're kind of managing this it's interesting I think that ABC NBC and
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.800]  CBS are not going to cover this there is going to be a lot of coverage on the
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.560]  Latin channels Univision and Telemundo as a matter of fact they're going to do
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.080]  it leading right up to the Latin Grammys assuring them that they're going to have
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.600]  a huge audience for the people that he's pandering to yeah and also reports
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.360]  coming out now that all these pro-illegal immigrant groups are going to be
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.800]  literally having street parties while this announcement is made I think he's
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.840]  going to speak at 8 p.m. it's going to be a 10 minute announcement then he's
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.240]  going to roll out the details he's going to announce the exact details of the
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:53.200]  executive amnesty program tomorrow so again this this could cause problems
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.600]  senator Tom Coburn has said that it could could cause Americans to go nuts in
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.800]  his own words violence and anarchy I wrote an article pointing out the timing
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.800]  of this with the Ferguson verdict this weekend we could see violence looting as
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.840]  a result of the expected acquittal of officer Darren Wilson so the timing of
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.200]  it the fact that it's being geared towards these pro-illegal immigrant
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.280]  groups which could then be out on the streets that could cause a confrontation
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.080]  with people who are angry at this as Coburn and others have warned yeah let's
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.740]  play that Coburn we've got that right here let's play that clip of senator
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:33.040]  Coburn warning of violence after the Obama immigration order president Obama
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.600]  on Friday is expected to announce the executive order on immigration what will
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.160]  the Republican reaction be here well I don't think it's so much the Republican
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.280]  reaction here the country is going to go nuts because they're going to see it as
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.040]  a move outside of the authority of the president and it's going to be a very
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:00.920]  dangerous situation you're going to see hopefully not but you could see instances
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:06.920]  of anarchy what do you mean well you could see violence you know this is a
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:13.360]  big step to to not work with Congress now that he's got a new Congress to go
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.320]  completely around it and to do things that a lot of legal debate on both sides
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.680]  whether or not he has the power to do that but what what what our country
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.320]  needs now is to be pulled together not divided further what do you think about
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.080]  that do you think we're going to see anarchy on the part of American
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.800]  citizens who are angry about this I don't really see that happening I I think
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.720]  we're going to see anarchy on the part of Obama exactly I mean we've seen
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.160]  confrontations when amnesty proponents have these rallies sometimes they
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.800]  intersect with tea party rallies or anti-amnesty activists so you could see
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.280]  some some confrontation so it's definitely a possibility in the long
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.960]  term all right we're going to get a break and we're going to be right back

[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.960]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin Anthony
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:35.840]  Gutiarty is joining me in the studio of course we have Paul Joseph Watson on the
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.960]  phone in UK now Anthony we just had this report came out yesterday about India
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.760]  isolating a man with Ebola infected semen now this is something we've talked
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.520]  about in the past that just because someone has recovered from Ebola it's
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:57.840]  still persists in their bodily fluids for many weeks after that and they
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.600]  actually took action in India they had a 26 year old man who was a native of India
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.440]  but he had gone from India to Liberia November 10th and he after two months
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.320]  after he was hospitalized in West Africa he showed symptoms of the illness they
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.040]  say now he's recovered from this but they as precautionary method they tested
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:22.560]  his bodily fluids and confirmed traces of the virus in his semen so he's now
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.400]  being quarantined because of that that is something that essentially kind of
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:33.240]  brings up the whole idea of a kind of a typhoid Mary in the sense you know we've
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.760]  always talked about people who are asymptomatic with Ebola but they could
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.280]  still be carriers but then there are also people who have recovered from the
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.240]  disease who still have traces of the disease in them and of course we hear
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.800]  from the CDC that of course just because somebody has Ebola in their bodily
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.720]  fluids doesn't mean that they can transcend no need to be concerned right
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.560]  just move along there's nothing to see here we know hats off to India because
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.280]  they actually did something about it yeah what we've always been saying what
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.640]  the mainstream media is missing every single time and the medical doctors I've
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.360]  spoken to keep saying over and over is like you said just because someone
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.960]  quote-unquote recovered from Ebola they can still transmit the disease for 60
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.760]  90 days and then you also have people that were in quarantine for 21 days who
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.720]  were suspected of having Ebola but then the CDC admits that it could take 56 or
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.440]  more days for some people with elevated immune systems and things like that to
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.960]  actually show signs of Ebola so we're releasing people onto the streets who
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.080]  can transmit Ebola or potentially can transmit Ebola and in the case of those
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.320]  doctors that were cured they can actually still transmit them in fact there
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.800]  was a piece about how they were told to not have sexual intercourse with their
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.800]  wives or their husbands so we're trusting people to go out and not have
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.240]  intercourse with their wife after not seeing them for months and being treated
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.280]  and saying you know we'll just trust them it'll be perfectly safe India is at
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.040]  least saying hey we need to do something about this because worst-case scenario it
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.120]  does happen and then the actual outbreak happens I think it underscores a whole
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.080]  idea of risk that people don't really want to understand they look at things
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.960]  they say well if the FDA approved this drug it's gonna be perfectly safe and
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.320]  yet there's this long list of possible side effects that you hear them announce
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.920]  on the commercials or if you bother to read the enclosed statement on the drug
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.200]  that you're buying you know you're talking about the quarantine methods you
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.120]  know when they they say if they isolate somebody for 21 days according to their
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.160]  data there's a 95 percent certainty that they won't pass it along but they're
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.480]  still 5% so they're willing to accept that 5% risk if they double it to 42
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.720]  days they say then it goes down to it goes up to 98% certainty but they're
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.280]  still willing to accept that 2% and that's the thing that concerns us with
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.920]  as many people now has as have come down with this Ebola outbreak because this
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.520]  is fundamentally different this is far more than all the previous 30 some odd
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.280]  outbreaks of Ebola combined this is more than four times as many if you combine
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.920]  all of those is about 2,500 people and they had had 10,000 people about a month
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.680]  ago that had already been affected with it and it's still growing in Sierra Leone
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.720]  and they say that in Liberia it's leveled out but earlier we had heard from the
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.760]  World Health Organization not to believe the numbers that were coming out of
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.920]  Liberia because the government was cooking it there but now we're told to
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.560]  believe those numbers and this is bigger than Ebola and I'm gonna break that
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.960]  down in one minute but I also want to talk about what I'm going to be talking
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.560]  about here in this segment in the next which is a report that's just up
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.000]  breaking now exclusive on info wars.com doctors potential Ebola cases still
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.440]  covered up by CDC and we're talking about not just Dr. Lorenzi who came on
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.840]  air a medical doctor proven works at one of the top hospitals in Kansas City
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.000]  area who's saying that they're disappearing Ebola patients and saying
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.560]  it's malaria but we're talking about my main contact and his medical
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.680]  professional friends I went to Dallas spoke with them again they are concerned
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.520]  about something very very serious they're concerned about the cover-up of
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.080]  these cases but they're concerned about something even more concerning it's up
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.680]  on info wars but we're gonna talk about it in a minute but I want to talk about
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:03.800]  right now how this whole Ebola nightmare scenario focuses not just on the
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.560]  disease which is a small part of it but overall they concern but on the
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.600]  delusion of government assistance so what this means is like you're talking
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.080]  about sure there's a 5% chance that there's an outbreak and we could all
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.840]  potentially be exposed to serious Ebola pandemic we're willing to take that
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  chance why not because we're smart and informed and statistically sitting down
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.640]  in Americans on their home couch or doing the numbers and crunching
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.720]  everything and saying well I'm willing to take versus this and this and this no
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.880]  yeah it's just because the government's coming out and telling the media not to
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.760]  report on potential Ebola cases right the government's coming out telling the
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.120]  media everything's fine telling the public everything's fine Fox News says
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.680]  case closed Ebola is over in what world Sierra Leone is still being ravaged by
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.240]  bullets going up and up and up and even the most conservative estimates say
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.120]  still throughout this year multiple cases in every major city of Ebola in the
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.080]  Ebola toilet of America that were shipping in Ebola patients from Africa so
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.960]  even the most conservative estimates so no it's not over and you know what's a
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.920]  real challenge to me is still talking about this when the mainstream media is
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.160]  like case closed everything's fine because the people that buy into that
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.880]  still think that everything is fine and there's there's no actual infectious
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.320]  disease to be worried about and then on another level we're just now sitting
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.160]  there saying well the government control the bowl of sore things fun we
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.400]  shouldn't boost our immune systems for the next thing for the bird flu or
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.680]  whatever is going to come next and they're ordering hazmat suits in the
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:33.640]  hundreds of thousands for reasons that are quite obvious to me well Anthony it
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:39.360]  was just this this last last couple of days that Obama signed another executive
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.280]  order we're talking about his executive orders on amnesty and climate change he
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.520]  signed an executive order granting amnesty to government contractors
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.640]  private businesses corporations who bring back Ebola to the United States so
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.880]  if they go over there and do whatever they're doing for the American
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.320]  government and they have employees who get sick and they bring the Ebola virus
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:06.120]  back you and I would not be able to sue them for negligence okay if he believes
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.960]  that that's necessary if he's going to sign an executive order to grant them
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.400]  amnesty or immunity right but we don't get immunity from the disease right
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.800]  because of that he's just giving them legal immunity but he still sees that
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.320]  as something that's a danger just like when he was at the CDC telling everybody
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.800]  that wasn't any chance that it was going to come to America and that was the
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.240]  middle of September we released I think it was Paul that released the story
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:36.760]  about 160,000 hazmat 250 yeah it does multiple numbers yeah oh yeah at that
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.240]  time it was only 160 now it's a tremendous number we're talking about
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.680]  liability you're talking about liability who's to blame for the Ebola outbreak
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.120]  right this is one of the key big pieces in this story again on n4 is called
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.600]  doctors potential Ebola cases still covered up by CDC CDC reportedly quote
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.440]  unquote disappearing patients and this is from doctors speaking to me some
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.080]  public some private the biggest one privately told me and this is the biggest
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.760]  piece right now that the whole issue is when Ebola happens again and starts
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.320]  breaking out in cities in major cities as the most conservative scientists say
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:15.320]  it will they're not going to blame the government themselves they're not going
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:20.200]  to blame Africa they're going to blame the independent hospitals and doctors
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.640]  responsible for yes they're going to blame the hospitals for them disappearing
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.640]  these quote-unquote malaria patient malaria patients which actually
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.880]  may be potential Ebola patients the doctors that I spoke to and again it was
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.680]  me and you on air last month when I said the beginning of this I only released
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.960]  some of it in an attempt to have people call in and see if they can confirm the
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:45.360]  story I talked about doctors revealing to me in Dallas that there were cases
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.400]  that were being disappeared from the hospital records by the CDC Dr. James
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.840]  Lorenzi who is proud enough and brave enough and amazing enough to come and
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.280]  be public about it revealed to us the same thing was happening up in Kansas
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.480]  City potential Ebola patients being quote-unquote disappeared and their
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.160]  records being destroyed as John Doe now beyond that I'm releasing some further
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.120]  information I'd like to hear some callers on it see if they can confirm this
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.320]  the doctors are freaking out that's a quote they're freaking out because they
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.160]  think that when further Ebola cases happen and when the families realize
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.280]  that these Ebola patients are potential Ebola patients we should say that they
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.280]  kept asking me to say potential for liability reasons that these potential
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.640]  Ebola patients being disappeared the families the citizens the investigative
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.560]  journalists the elements of the government that are good are going to
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.920]  one answers and they're deathly afraid that they're going to come after them
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.400]  for it they're going to come after these hospitals and these are people that own
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.680]  hospitals and emergency care centers these aren't just small-time people
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.200]  they're afraid of what's going to happen in the aftermath they're going to be
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.240]  blamed for the CDC coming in and disappearing the patients well you
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.480]  know the doctor who called us and went on record one of the things he was
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:58.200]  saying was that they didn't have adequate protection protective clothing to
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.440]  start with but what they did have was being confiscated and over this weekend
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.240]  the Washington Post ran this article about this doctor who was brought back
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.960]  I think he came back on Saturday he was gravely ill they tried to treat him with
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.040]  convalescent serum as well as with Z-Map the genetically modified drug that
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.000]  they've created none of that worked and he died like the next day and as I'm
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.920]  reading this story there's an ad that pops up in the middle of it from a
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.840]  nursing association and it's like two pictures that are alternating with each
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.640]  other one of them says this is what they give us to protect us from Ebola and
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.360]  it's like a mask and a glove okay and it says this is what we need it shows a
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.760]  full personal protective suit right and they're asking people to help them to
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.680]  get this information out but of course the Washington Post is completely
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.880]  ignoring it the only way they're going to get that information out in the
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:52.520]  mainstream press is to place an ad in an article about Ebola because the
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.400]  Washington Post isn't going to talk about how they don't have adequate
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.640]  protection for the medical personnel how they're being left out hung out to dry
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.360]  and then of course they're going to be the ones who are going to be blamed for
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.080]  it they're going to take the liability exactly they're freaking out and they've
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.960]  been but here's the thing they're going around saying hey CDC hey government
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.160]  overall we don't have the necessary equipment we don't know what to do and
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:15.840]  then the government says you're fine and then when the Ebola patient comes in
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.080]  like the LA Times had an article where they interviewed the nurses and the
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.640]  nurses said yeah Thomas Eric Duncan I believe his name he sat in the waiting
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.720]  room for like two hours spreading Ebola everywhere and we didn't have the
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.600]  necessary equipment to even take him in so we just took him in like normal and
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.240]  he told us he was from Africa you know he had come from Africa and we didn't
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.840]  know what to do and then they're going to come back and they're going to say
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.520]  well hospital you handled it incorrectly you caused the spread exactly
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.000]  not us exactly that's where the liability comes in we're talking to Anthony
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  Gutiarty here in the studio we've got Paul Joseph Watson who's going to be
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.120]  joining us from the UK will be right back stay with us we're talking about the
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.800]  Ebola cover-ups is it over I don't think so I wish it was but it doesn't look like
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:03.680]  it stay with us if you have candida overgrowth just taking antifungal agents
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.400]  or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause candida overgrowth is
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.120]  the result of a toxic damage acidic low oxygen and inflamed tissue environment
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.040]  the goal should be to remove the toxins heal damaged tissues restore healthy
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.280]  pH eliminate inflammation and feed beneficial bacteria previous usage of
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.520]  antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.480]  cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to candida overgrowth

[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.600]  show I'm David Knight here in Austin with Anthony Gucciardi we were just
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.880]  talking about his story that's just been picked up on the dredge report
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.520]  potential Ebola cases are still being covered up by the CDC according to
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.840]  doctors that Anthony has talked to we also have Paul Joseph Watson on the
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.240]  line and the UK and Paul of course you covered this story about the lady who
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.680]  just died in New York a couple of days ago they're watching her about Ebola we
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.920]  had witnesses saying that she was bleeding profusely as she fell over dead
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.120]  but then they came back later and said no there's no blood and she didn't die
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.360]  of Ebola she died of a heart attack or a stroke or something like that is that
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.880]  correct yeah that was a bizarre case the eye witnesses this was a lady in a
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.440]  hair salon that just collapsed and died a couple of days ago the eye
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.720]  witnesses who spoke to the media said she was bleeding out of her nose and
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.880]  mouth she had returned from Guinea around 18 days earlier the hazmat crew
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.200]  turns up says that it's a fever stroke travel illness that they were dealing
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.360]  with and then within about an hour they said oh no it's just a heart attack no
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.440]  problem and then it completely disappeared we know that the 911 dispatches
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.120]  have been told not to even use the word Ebola in New York City the media's
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.640]  agreed not to report on potential Ebola cases so it was a very bizarre incident
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.960]  but this new story which is out of Reuters sounds like it's out of the
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.960]  onion but it's not it's out of Reuters headline is us to allow people from
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.000]  nations hit by Ebola to stay temporarily Department of Homeland Security will
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.080]  grant temporaries protected status to people from the three West African
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.640]  countries most affected by Ebola who are currently residing in the United
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.160]  States they're gonna give them amnesty for 18 months they've just come from
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.720]  Ebola stricken countries they can stay in the country for 18 months and then
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:19.000]  that period will then potentially be extended after the 18 months so we're
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.360]  not just talking about amnesty for illegal aliens now they're going to give
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:28.320]  potential Ebola victims amnesty in the United States the DHS has just announced
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.480]  that today absolutely ludicrous it sounds like it's out the undie onion but
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.120]  it's Reuters that's reporting on that today and then they call us conspiracy
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:39.680]  theorists for saying that these top doctors that run hospitals some have
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.560]  gone public are saying that there are cases covered up by the CDC and they're
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.160]  disappearing them meanwhile our government is willing to ship in Ebola patients
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.160]  and basically give them temporary citizenship to come over here for 18
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:57.040]  months and potentially cause another outbreak but then we're called conspiracy
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.320]  theorists for saying hey there are cases of Ebola and also it's important to note
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.400]  by the way on that Forbes article where there was a professor that goes from Duke
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.320]  he said in the in the article that we're so thankful to the Associated Press for
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.320]  not reporting on potential unsuspected cases of Ebola unless they've been
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:20.600]  confirmed by the authorities and the backlash was so much that he had to go
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.680]  an issue it's actually just happened he had to go in and say that actually never
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:29.920]  happened I was totally confused that never happened the AP never actually
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.440]  agreed to that you know that article he goes on and just says that actually never
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.120]  happened the conversation I said happened specifically down to the detail in
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.960]  the quote that never happened on issue after issue after issue whether it's the
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.320]  border whether it's the climate change mandates that are coming along whether
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.920]  it's this latest amazing order saying that they're going to allow people to
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:56.360]  have amnesty to come in if you know for 18 months if they're in an Ebola area and
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.280]  every one of these issues and many more you look at it and you say what is Obama
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.240]  trying to do is he trying to deliberately destroy this country and I think
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:09.000]  you have to say yes he deliberately is trying to destroy this country in every
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.080]  way he can constitutionally legally economically with health pandemics when
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.440]  you look at the guys that are being sent to Ebola the soldiers that are being
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:24.480]  sent over there as we've talked to the fellow who wrote the the treaties I
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.600]  can't remember his name right now I'm drawing a blank but Francis Boyle thank
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.120]  you Francis Boyle and he said these are elite troops that are being sent over
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.520]  they're fighting troops they're not being sent over as engineers or relief
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.200]  workers and as they had the congressional hearings they were saying we're
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.120]  going to send them back after 10 days and the congressman were like wait a
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.360]  minute wait a minute we've heard that 21 days is the magic day and finally he
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.680]  admitted well for all practical purposes the entire country is an infectious
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.080]  zone when they had said they weren't even going to give them protective
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.640]  equipment when they sent him over there they're trying to bring it back they're
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.520]  doing everything they can sending soldiers there to bring them back as
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.480]  well as bringing in just opening the doors to anybody to immigrate from you
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.400]  know David and Paul we're talking about a government that has injected since

[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.200]  david night in austin your host today along with paul joseph watson in the
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.520]  uk and we were just talking to anthony gutier in the studio his story doctors
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.800]  say potential ebola cases are still being covered up by the cdc and it's some
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.840]  new information he talked to some doctor sources in dallas and elsewhere who are
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.960]  very concerned that they're going to be the ones who are the fall guys they're
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:55.600]  going to be the ones who are going to be blamed as obama is bringing in ebola
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.760]  essentially a story that paul joseph wasn't just read to us from I think it
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.320]  was was it roiders paul that you had there like you said it sounded like
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:08.280]  something out of the onion but it's just another onion layer of tyranny in the
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.640]  sense that obama is now going to open the border specifically to people coming
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.840]  in from ebola affected countries just absolutely amazing isn't paul well
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.320]  david I actually underplayed it they're actually they're not going to just give
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.360]  people residency for 18 months and then a potential further period of time they're
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.840]  going to give them work permits so these people could be working in
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.720]  transportation they could be working in hospitals they could be giving you your
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.680]  flu shots this is people who are returning from the west african
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.840]  countries hit by ebola who were already in the united states granting them
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.520]  amnesty for at least a year and a half and potentially more giving them work
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.600]  permit so it's it's even worse than I originally said well well well we've
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.640]  got a guess I want to get on who is the another story that you covered back
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.600]  beginning of this month but before we move on I want to tell everybody that we
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.640]  now have silver bullet back in it's unlimited supply it takes six weeks to
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.600]  get it in because it's such a difficult process to make it in such high
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.400]  concentrations our silver bullet is concentrated colloidal silver in 30
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.880]  parts per million it's in a pure base of the ionized water it's a very difficult
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:20.600]  manufacturing process because we use ultra high voltage electrical process
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.840]  that generates very small size particles and ensures the stability of these
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:32.080]  particles is in a toxic a toxic free our solution here with the the ionized
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.760]  water is something that will take us a long time to replenish like I said it's
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:41.600]  a very good time right now this time of year with the flu and cold and a lot of
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.920]  viruses as well as any kind of infection that you get exposed to it's
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:50.280]  something that historically has been widely used and that is silver very
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:55.320]  natural ingredient to protect yourself against what's in the environment you
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:04.680]  can get that at info wars life calm or you can call 888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.000]  that's silver bullet now Paul you had this story back is on November the
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.080]  3rd in Florida we had a 90 year old man who has been feeding the homeless for
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:21.240]  quite some time and they passed a new ordinance and they arrested him it got
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:24.600]  quite nasty but this is something that's been going on and on for quite some
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:28.880]  time I want to get Mr. Abbott on the line now do we have him on the line guys
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.920]  okay good mr. Abbott thank you for joining us I
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:37.480]  I wanted to talk to you directly because I wanted people to hear your story I
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.400]  think it's always important for us to understand when we engage in civil
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.680]  disobedience to understand that there are moral issues that transcend
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:52.080]  arbitrary regulations with local governments or even national
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.280]  governments I wanted you to kind of give us a background tell us a little bit
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.080]  about your operation now what you do there okay but for the last 23 years
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.400]  we've been feeding the homeless in Port Lauderdale Florida we feed on the beach
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.920]  every Wednesday evening but this last night and we feed every Sunday at the
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:17.160]  different location inland from the ocean and we've been doing that without
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:22.000]  pause for the first eight years and then the city decided that they would
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.960]  they want us to stop feeding on the beach because they objected to the
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.720]  homeless being where the tourists might come in and might spoil the looks of
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:37.560]  their beautiful beach so we took them to court 15 years ago and we had three
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.760]  trials in the circuit court which we beat the city three times they then took us
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.200]  to the Court of Appeals in Palm Beach we beat them twice there and the matter
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:53.280]  was over for some years and then October 22nd of this year they scrapped all of
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.040]  their old laws and came out with brand new ones which were impossible for most
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:05.320]  of the people feeding the homeless to in any way comply with because it required
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:09.640]  every feeding group to bring a port of party with them if you can imagine that
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.280]  being a possibility wherever they said they had to have a portable toilet with
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:21.000]  them and of course at the beach we happen to repeat their agitation through the
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.400]  only restrooms in the whole city so that's not a portion of it but that's
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:30.840]  that's the cut part we cover actually of the new law and all of the other
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.080]  fundamental items that have to do with sanitation we comply with because we
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.720]  teach culinary arts and with which the sanitation is a very big part of now
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.560]  you've had regulations in the past you said you took them to court but this
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.640]  time it was a little bit different wasn't it? Yes it was because it referred to all
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:55.200]  the sanitation laws that most people mostly feeders could absolutely not comply
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.720]  with we could because we teach sanitation one of our courses to the homeless
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:06.240]  students we have so we had no problem but then they decided that after we won
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.800]  the case for the beach to feed on the beach that they'd make that a no feeding
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.080]  zone for social services and wear social services so again we took them to court
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:23.560]  we beat them and now they revised everything and that they again revised
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.720]  the part that said no social services on the beach and you can't feed without
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:33.920]  a permit and they will not issue permits so that's where we stand right now we
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.840]  are filling the city of Port Lauderdale again this time we have a contempt
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:42.800]  charge because they're actually in contempt of a court order that was
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:48.240]  issued 15 years ago so that's where we stand and last evening was the first
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.520]  time we had had not had the police presence that are feeding us there
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:58.760]  attended 20 police officers and this morning I had a telephone debate with
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:02.920]  the mayor they had to cause this morning in which I inquired why there were no
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:08.120]  police officers there last night and he very happily replied that yes they were
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:12.480]  they were in plain clothes and we followed every move you made and you
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.640]  could you can expect your force to citation in the mail let me ask you let
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.680]  me ask you mr. Arnold mr. Abbott you've been a World War II veteran you're 90
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.200]  years old you've lived in this country for a very long time did you ever think
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.120]  that you would get you would see the day where this kind of thing would happen
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.360]  in the United States where they would be so callous to people who were at the
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.400]  bottom of society that they would threaten to arrest you and kind of get
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:45.320]  kind of in your face about it it was originally reported that they grabbed
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.520]  you by the hand and said drop that plate right now did you ever think that you
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:53.920]  would see that kind of day in America well unfortunately I've had to fight
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.960]  civil rights the last 50 years of my life so I've been counted the KKK and
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:04.960]  all other organizations who you'll fight giving equal rights to anybody so I'm
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.760]  used to it but I know you're right I never expected to see it in South
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:15.680]  Florida and I'll tell you one thing that really embarrasses me for my country I
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.800]  have received two requests from the communist country two from China and
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.080]  one from Moscow can you believe question why and the United States of America
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.280]  or the market sees those three different government they're doing this and that's
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:35.520]  pretty embarrassing for any American I have to answer well I guess I guess my
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.680]  concern about it is to you know we look at homeless people and we see the
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.280]  shooting not too long ago in New Mexico that was captured on the police video
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.560]  cam where they had a homeless man they talked to him for quite some time but
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.240]  he was absolutely no threat to him they shot and killed him from a distance and
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:59.520]  then just at the end of October we had homeless man shot 49 times by believe
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.320]  eight different officers and he was standing maybe about 30 feet away from
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:08.480]  him absolutely no danger to them whatsoever we see this happening and
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:12.240]  the escalation of the violence that's happening I guess that's the thing that
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.720]  really concerns me we've seen homeless people rounded up and shipped out as
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:22.120]  they have their political conventions in certain towns because they don't want
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.720]  them to be seen or they have a big G20 meeting or something like that so they
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.440]  ship all the homeless people out to another area because they don't want to
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.880]  be embarrassed by that but they're getting really brutal and heartless
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.240]  towards not only the homeless people but of course to all citizens we see this
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.320]  happening now that's essentially what I think people need to be focusing on in
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:45.920]  Ferguson but that's turned into a black-white thing rather than what why are
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.080]  we allowing the authorities to do this to the people of America I think it's
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:55.800]  more than black-white I think it's poor against the rich that's the way it is
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.920]  and for the other day I have called the city commission the mayor and the
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.480]  four other commissioners puppets of the mega rich and the powerful people who
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:10.440]  live here their orders are to get rid of the homeless get rid of them and they've
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.920]  done such heartless things that you couldn't believe but if they they have
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:19.580]  no sleeping so almost person can't even lay down on the ground to sleep and
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:24.560]  for a lot of that I'll be arrested they have vigilante groups very reckless it's
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.480]  very much like the Ku Klux Klan people go around bass at night two three four
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.160]  and five in the morning take pictures where the homeless are sleeping and
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:36.920]  turn it over to the police so they can be arrested and arrested that's what's
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:43.680]  going on down here it is horrible and I intend to fight this and so I was just
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:50.160]  resting my body well I thank you for doing that I guess you know it's it's not
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.560]  just the brutal incidents that we see of the man in New Mexico the one in
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.000]  Michigan then of course Kelly Thomas who was brutally beaten for an extended
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.680]  period time a homeless man who was just beaten to death we see that and that's
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:08.040]  so egregious and I I guess people say well you know it's the homeless and
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.800]  they're crazy so you know the police need to do whatever the police need to do
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.200]  to that but if we allow them to do that to the homeless people we should
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:21.240]  understand that that creates a callousness towards all humanity that is
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:24.960]  going to eventually find its way back to us and even before they get to the
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:29.440]  point of shooting them or beating them to death there's the issue of just not
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.760]  having enough compassion to even allow somebody to give them some food that
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.280]  that's the amazing thing to me it is amazing I was a police commissioner back
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:42.920]  in the 50s and suburban Philadelphia so I'm well aware what police departments
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.320]  are all about there are good cops and there was always some bad apple and
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.840]  don't ever forget we had George Zimmerman up here and what has been made of the
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:59.440]  fact that he was able to stand his ground and kill an unarmed kid that's
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.880]  really what's going on people are gun-crate you'd be honest with it yes
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:10.080]  and it's terrible we have I don't know if anybody saw the Cold Bear show but
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:16.880]  they did a wonderful takeoff on this situation we have and but the problem is
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:23.000]  really it's more than just economic it's more than black against white the poor
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.240]  against the rich it's just becoming a fad the self-defense nonsense that they
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:34.280]  talk about people kill each other all the time I think I'm not comment about it
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.840]  well there doesn't seem to be any for the victim tomorrow the victim everything
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:43.480]  they own is on their back and they're they're accused of everything that goes
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:49.040]  wrong and they are the innocent who are the ones that are picked up I understand
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:53.720]  the people's right of self-defense but you know as a police officer former
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.120]  police officer that you have to establish the fact that somebody was a
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:01.720]  genuine threat to you and that's one of the things that Frank Serpico has talked
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.560]  about he's talked about Ferguson and other issues he said we've gotten to the
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.200]  culture now where police all they have to say is I felt that I was threatened in
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:14.640]  some way and then lethal force is justified he said when he was in the
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.280]  force when Frank Serpico was in the force he would fire a couple of shots
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.280]  and then reassess the situation instead of emptying his gun into people and
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.440]  that's what we saw happen in Michigan with these eight officers they all just
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.640]  emptied their guns into this one homeless man who wasn't a threat whatsoever to
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.000]  them I don't want to totally monopolize this I know that Paul had
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.760]  originally picked up this article and I imagine we've got Paul Joseph Watson one
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.360]  of our writers in the UK he's on the line and I imagine he's got a question
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.960]  that he would like to ask you mr. Abbott Paul do you want to ask him
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.600]  something yeah I was just wondering with the case going forward we saw a very
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:53.080]  visible presence from the police on the beach when you were feeding the
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.520]  homeless previously last night as you said they weren't at least out in force
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.200]  visibly do you think that's a sign that the city is beginning to back down or
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.040]  is it just being done for public relations I think that the police are
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.360]  embarrassed by what they're forced to do by the city fathers they've acted very
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:16.160]  much like they they didn't want to do what they did they didn't want to lead
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:21.560]  me to a police car and write me up on a citation they actually I think are
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:25.320]  sympathetic to our cause but there's they have to do what they're ordered to do
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:31.560]  their employees and the struggle was just said about the surrogate I call it
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:37.280]  fake public provocation because as the police commissioner I saw many times
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:42.560]  cases where evidence was planted on the victims and of course so the police
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.200]  can claim that they were threatened and that happens all the time too it's it
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.920]  just it's ill in nature if I have good cops and bad cops no matter what you do
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:57.400]  and what you have to do is to improve the courts so they recognize that these
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.680]  people have very little or no representation whatsoever and I want
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:07.080]  started write a book called the American justice system and strangely enough it
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:14.160]  had mostly to do with with Houston, Texas and the fact that capital cases
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.600]  have in Houston, if you were born black stay away from Houston because that
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.640]  county had no time and place for people who were poor and there were so many
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.760]  people were indicted and tried for murder cases and actually they were
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:34.960]  generated that some years later but the unfortunate thing is it already been
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.040]  executed so it's just it's just a horrible thing that happens in our court
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:44.960]  system I think that's where you have to start things being turned around because
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.520]  the court sacked it more humanely and there was some merciful considerations
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:56.480]  and also helping to have good people with the proper representation when they
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.600]  go to court people to do some investigation and I think that that's
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.720]  probably should be eliminated a hundred percent because where you don't have
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:11.320]  equal justice and you have no no provocation either moral ethical or
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.880]  religious for the death penalty there's no reason for it it's not
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:21.720]  admitted fairly and that's that's capital crime and it's done terribly in
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.640]  our court system and I apologize for taking all that time oh no absolutely
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.720]  no I agree with that I kind of take Ron Paul's position on that I mean I'm not
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.400]  in principle opposed to the death penalty for certain things but I don't
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.560]  believe that people are going to get a fair trial or that they're going to get
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.840]  equal protection under the law in our court system and so because of that I
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.200]  don't support it when I was reading this article where Frank Serpico was
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.880]  talking about I thought it's interesting observation that he made that he said
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.440]  back in the day but that he was involved I believe it was in the 70s he said the
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:59.200]  real issue was corruption about police lining their pockets with money but he
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.960]  says now it seems like the epidemic is the use of force the unrestrained use of
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.600]  force and as you mentioned Mr. Abbott there are good cops and there are bad
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:12.960]  cops what needs to be done in your opinion as a former police officer I
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:15.480]  wasn't aware that you were a former police officer but as a former police
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.200]  officer what is in your opinion should we do when we have a bad cop who is
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.720]  uses a necessary force and injures someone what what should happen with that
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.280]  well we should have a more proper investigation than currently it's done
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.160]  that usually they just take them put them on desk duty for a couple of weeks
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.720]  and then they're back on the street or wherever exactly they investigate
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:43.400]  themselves don't they yeah yeah absolutely and it's it's just a bad
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:49.160]  system they don't teach humanity 101 and that's that's what the police should
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:53.040]  learn they should learn how to behave with people how to treat people they
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.080]  forget they need to protect persons of property thank you so much for joining us

[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:26.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin Paul Joseph
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:31.080]  Watson is with us in the UK we were just talking to Arnold Abbott and of course
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:36.000]  he's the 90 year old volunteer in Florida who's been threatened with arrest
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.080]  multiple times the police kind of got in his face a bit in the early days
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.720]  threatened him because he was feeding the homeless now he was also a former
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:51.640]  police commissioner so we talked to him about the different ways that the
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  government has been brutalizing homeless people as well but when we look at
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.680]  this Paul I'm reminded of course it was in Florida as well that we saw the Terry
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:06.720]  Shavo incident you know where people were arrested at that time for trying to
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.680]  give Terry Shavo a drink of water and of course some of the people who are
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.120]  working with Arnold Abbott there are some Christian ministers in that area one
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.600]  of them said we're simply trying to feed people who are hungry to criminalize
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.800]  that is contrary to everything I stand for as a priest and as a person of
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:32.440]  faith I think it really underscores when we need to stand up in civil
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:38.760]  disobedience against immoral laws I think it's a real important point for
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:43.200]  people who are confused about Romans 13 and think that the government has some
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:48.840]  kind of absolute authority no there is a higher moral law just as Jesus said I
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.440]  was hungry and you didn't give me food I was thirsty and you gave me no water we
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:56.520]  saw that in Florida literally saw that with Terry Shavo now we're seeing it
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:01.560]  with these people as well I think the Terry Shavo case was far worse because
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.400]  that was one individual but they were this is one judge who had a court order
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:10.440]  that nobody could feed her or give her water and yet we saw the Bush brothers
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.760]  stand by and not countermand that we had Jeb Bush as governor we had George W
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.840]  as president at the time I was absolutely appalled when that happened
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.400]  Paul what do you say do you remember that I remember it well even though it was
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.200]  what about nine ten years ago now I mean she she died one of the most
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:33.120]  excruciating death that anyone could possibly experience absolutely no yeah
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.680]  it was it was horrific with the Abbott case I think there's also another aspect
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:41.840]  to it which is they don't they don't care about sanitation issues they want to
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:46.240]  send this message that anybody who defies these ordinances no matter how
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.720]  unfair they may be will be punished they don't want that message of defiance to
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:55.240]  reverberate and spread to include and influence any other aspect of government
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:59.320]  also the mayor came out with some interesting comments about two weeks
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.840]  ago he said basically that people should be the homeless in Fort Lauderdale
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:08.360]  should be forced to quote have interaction with government so they
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:12.280]  need these homeless people to be dependent on the government they don't
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.080]  want the fellow citizens helping them out because again that would spread a
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.440]  message of community and getting the homeless getting people on low income
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.960]  below the poverty line away from being dependent on government and going
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.000]  towards charity and help from their fellow citizens so the government the
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.840]  city does not want that message or that precedent to be established in Fort
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.080]  Lauderdale it cuts to the very heart of the welfare state the welfare state is
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.120]  not there about compassion and we can clearly see that the government
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.400]  doesn't care about compassion the way they treat homeless people beating them
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:49.000]  to death shooting them to death denying people you know the ability to give
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.560]  them food without coming after those people and we also see and I think it's
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:56.360]  very important for people to understand take step back and take a look at this
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.520]  and understand that there are higher moral laws that just because the
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:04.120]  government passes some kind of a regulation sometimes it's not only
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:08.840]  you're right but your duty to oppose that regulation I saw that the report
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.800]  that I did as part of the reporters contest was with an older gentleman as
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:17.640]  well he was in his 80s and he was fighting for fully informed juries that
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.480]  was Julian Hicklin you know these guys who are older they don't have a lot of
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.880]  and you can't really intimidate them as they say you know when you've got nothing
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.320]  left to lose that's another name for freedom so we're gonna be right back
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:34.680]  with Paul Joseph Watson we're gonna be talking about the immigration executive
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:41.200]  orders and really that's the key it's Obama as emperor we'll be right back

[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:31.640]  Austin Paul Joseph Watson is joining me in the UK we're gonna take your calls
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.480]  and see what you think about the executive actions that Obama has taken
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:41.760]  hardly a day goes by that he doesn't just declare a new law we saw earlier this
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:46.200]  week that he gave immunity to corporations that would be working with him
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  in Liberia of course he's going to give immunity and amnesty to illegal aliens
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:56.960]  tonight and he's also signaled that he's going to act on his own with climate
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.840]  change and there's nothing that the Republicans can do to stop him he's got
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.440]  a long agenda that he's going to enact because he doesn't have to stand for
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:10.840]  election and he could care less about how badly he damages the Democrat Party
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.440]  just as he could care less how badly he damages America so if you want to call
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:23.480]  and give us your opinion that number is 800-259-9231 that's 800-259-9231 we've
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.760]  got Paul Joseph Watson with us at the bottom of the hour we're going to be
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:29.600]  talking to our reporters in Ferguson because that's another hot spot that is
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:35.560]  ready to erupt at any moment another part of the class war that's being
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:40.480]  established by the government but you know Paul we were just talking to Arnold
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.360]  Abbott the 90 year old man who has been threatened with arrest multiple times
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.600]  for feeding the homeless and Fort Lauderdale we got on to Terry Shavo
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.760]  this just surfaced today I saw this for the first time this is Jonathan Gruber
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:59.520]  back in the news back in May 1997 the same guy that lied to us about health
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:03.680]  care in Massachusetts with Romney care and of course Mitt Romney thanked him so
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:07.800]  much for his economic models that helped to get that passed and then of course he
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:13.480]  is now bragging about how he lied and deceived the American public about
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:18.760]  Obamacare in general but even before that he was working on of all things Paul
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:24.760]  he was working on abortion back in May 1997 he's the top author on a paper
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:29.600]  called abortion legalization and child living circumstances who is the quote
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:35.120]  marginal child and in this he makes the argument that children who were born
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.840]  after Roe v Wade have such better standards of living because of abortion
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:46.040]  actually it's a he's argues that it's a great thing Paul same guy who told us
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:49.160]  that Obamacare was going to be good who lied to us about the economics he
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:54.880]  wouldn't lie to us about the effects of abortion would he well again it's this
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.520]  whole thing about you know you're supposed to not brag about it when you
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:02.240]  when you get caught doing these programs through trickery which is what they
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:07.480]  did with Gruber and Obamacare but the New York Times actually ran defense for
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:13.440]  Obama and said that he had a limited role in crafting Obamacare even though he
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.160]  went to the White House on a dozen occasions he met with Obamacare he was
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:21.520]  giving these speeches months before it passed bragging about the fact that
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.000]  Americans were stupid and that's how they could get it passed and then
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.440]  literally hours after the New York Times came out and said that his role was
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:34.280]  limited a key advisor to Obamacare came out and said that Gruber was quote the
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:39.960]  guru that he was an important figure in getting Obamacare passed so they got
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:46.080]  caught lying NBC ABC CNN have completely buried the story if you actually look at
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:50.080]  the graphs of how many times Gruber has been mentioned over the past couple of
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:55.720]  weeks it's basically nonexistent on the the pro-Obama network so they've
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.240]  managed to some extent to cover it up what was heartening was the fact that on
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:04.880]  Twitter for a round of week Gruber was one of the top trending hashtag terms
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.320]  even amidst all the mindless rubbish about Kim Kardashian's behind them
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.040]  whatever Gruber maintained its position in those top Twitter trends which shows
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:17.440]  the that the American people were talking about it still talking about it
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.560]  breaking through that black wall of censorship that was erected by the likes
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:28.040]  of NBC ABC and CNN he's one of these masters of propaganda and twisting he
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:30.640]  talked about how they had to torture the numbers to make them look the way they
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:34.240]  wanted to one of the things that he's torturing in this is the terminology
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:38.440]  about children he talks about cohorts as being the children who are actually
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:42.680]  born you know you go from a fetus to a cohort the only time he talks about
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:47.320]  children is when he talks about the marginal child in other words those who
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.560]  were not born because abortion was legal we're going to talk a little bit of
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:54.360]  more about that and take your calls right after the break stay with us Paul

[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:44.280]  fear are going to happen there but in the last segment we were talking about
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:49.960]  this new revelation that's actually it's an old paper from jonathan gruber the
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:55.320]  guy who has come out as kind of the poster child for the way the government
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.880]  and particularly the bureaucracy and these experts that they pull up the way
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:02.560]  they lie and manipulate the public of course he was instrumental in passing
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.760]  romney care mit romney thanked him profusely for his economic models which
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:14.600]  have now proven to be a total lie just as they were for obama care and he has
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:19.440]  surfaced in many many different venues bragging about how he deceived the
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:24.040]  american public but let's look at this one paper this goes back to 1997 i i
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.960]  thought it was kind of interesting in the way that it gives a glimpse to their
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:33.160]  techniques to their character in this particular paper he's talking about the
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:39.160]  legalization of abortion and how that was a good thing because he said what
[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:43.640]  is the effect on the marginal child now here's how he defines the marginal child
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:49.120]  the marginal child is the one who's born when abortion access who is not
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:53.920]  born when abortion access increases so in other words the child who is
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:10:00.480]  aborted is simply a marginal child is that marginal child he says more or less
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:07.080]  disadvantaged than the average child in other words if a child is killed before
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:13.360]  it's born is it more or less advantaged than the average child so we're killing
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:16.880]  these children for their own good it's not for our own good it's not because
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.680]  we don't want to be bothered with it because it's an economic hardship or
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:23.200]  other issues or because we just don't understand what's going on no they're
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:26.120]  actually the marginal child is better and he talks about the children who are
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.520]  actually born he calls them cohorts he says we find that cohorts i think
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.400]  that's interesting term cohorts born after abortion was legalized
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:37.400]  experience a significant reduction in the number of adverse incomes our
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:41.200]  estimates imply that the marginal child who is not born due to legalization
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:46.040]  would have been 70% more likely to live in a single parent family 40% more
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.840]  likely to live in poverty 50% more likely to receive welfare 35% more
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:56.000]  likely to die as an infant so let's just kill him and they're better off so
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.640]  that's what he's saying the marginal child is better off that's the kind of
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:05.880]  lies that the master technician behind Romney care which is the same thing as
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:10.920]  Obamacare that's what Peter Gruber has been cutting his teeth on for a long
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:14.720]  time Jonathan Gruber so I keep calling him Peter Gruber because it's a Peter
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:18.360]  Gruber in the in the movie industry and I keep referring back but Jonathan
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:22.680]  Gruber you want to comment on that Paul before we take a call yeah well it's
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.360]  it's the kind of rhetoric that just dehumanizes life that's what it sounds
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.200]  like to me the major concern now obviously as we illustrated with all
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.280]  these campus videos where we send out Joe Biggs for example other people have
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.080]  done it too where college students will sign petitions advocating post birth
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:45.640]  abortion yes and this is also something that the establishment media has jumped
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:50.680]  on board with to some extent MSNBC's Melissa Harris Perry who of course said
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:54.920]  the children belong to the state she said newborn infants don't count as
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:00.800]  being considered quote a lot alive so this is an entree to legitimizing
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:06.040]  infanticide we had the academic paper a couple of years ago I think out of the
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.400]  University of Melbourne which argued that after birth abortion should be
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.400]  permissible this is a quote including in cases where the newborn is not
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:19.720]  disabled so they're talking about after birth abortion infanticide like you
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:25.080]  have in China where women are grabbed off the street drugged given forced
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:30.920]  abortions the babies dumped in a bucket and now the academia in the West and the
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:35.880]  media in the United States is in a creeping fashion beginning to advocate
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:40.560]  infanticide post birth abortion so that's how deep down the rabbit hole this
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.440]  has gone now and they portrayed this as oh they're doing it for the sake of the
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:50.800]  child the child would have been perhaps at a 35% higher chance of living in this
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.720]  kind of condition a single parent home as if that was something that we saved
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:00.760]  them from but of course it's the industry isn't it Paul we Rob do just put
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:06.320]  this article on my desk former abortion clinic director says our goal was three
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:11.200]  to five abortions per student this was in round Rock Texas right here around
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.760]  Austin abortion clinics our businesses they point out just like muffler shops
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:20.320]  or fast food restaurants and that's the kind of justification the kind of
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.360]  tortured logic that we see happening and I think it's really kind of a slippery
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.760]  slope like we were just talking to Arnold Abbott the the 90 year old who's
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:32.880]  trying to feed the homeless when you're willing to take food out of the mouths
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:36.840]  of homeless people or out of somebody who is sick and helpless like Terry
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:41.000]  Chavo arresting people who are trying to feed that person give that person
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.640]  water when you're willing to do that when people will stand by and watch
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:49.280]  homeless people be shot and brutalized on the streets that is the slippery slope
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:53.160]  for an entire country because now we're entering into an area where they're
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:56.560]  going to eventually do that to everybody because it's just training for them
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:02.480]  isn't it? Well I mean on the point you just mentioned Planned Parenthood got
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:06.600]  its start by putting the abortion clinics in poor black areas yes they
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.360]  bragged about it at the time yeah and then their supporters the bit the
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:14.080]  feminist icons like Marie Stopes you know that the woman who wrote love
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.480]  letters to Hitler she bragged about it too so that's how they make their money
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:23.280]  is by aborting predominantly black babies in poor areas and then they brag
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:29.080]  about it so it gives you an insight into their motivations absolutely we don't
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:32.120]  have too much more time left in this segment but we got a couple of segments
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:35.680]  here and I said we'd take some calls we got some people on the line let's go to
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:42.120]  Larry and Michigan Larry you want to talk about immigration? David how you doing
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.920]  today? Doing good what do you want to say? Okay two things I want to talk about
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:51.240]  immigration and then I got a question I'd like for you to ask Ron or Ron Paul
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:57.600]  next time he's on okay on immigration we've been here in this 11,000
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:04.160]  number for what 10 years so that says the government according to the
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.840]  government there is no illegal come here in the last 10 years I'm not sure
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.520]  what you're talking about with the 11,000 number or 11 million I'm sorry yeah
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:19.280]  11 yeah what million mm-hmm there's 11 million oh yeah this is just the tip of
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:22.520]  the iceberg isn't it as Paul was saying they've had green cards printed up for
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:27.880]  over 30 million green cards what was it 34 Paul? 34 million yeah yeah 34
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:32.600]  million yeah so we know this is this is a huge this is the numbers that they're
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:36.120]  giving us a five million or whatever that's huge and when he goes in and
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:41.560]  does this he's really kind of setting up an entitlement program anybody that
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:47.080]  matches the conditions that he sets out are going to be entitled to the
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.120]  benefits that he's going to lay out tonight by executive order as well so
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:53.520]  they don't really know what this is going to be and of course there's
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:58.560]  nothing in this that's going to really stop anything people from coming into
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:00.680]  the boarders the boarders are still going to be open so this is going to
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:03.760]  continue was there anything else you wanted to say what was the question you
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:10.360]  had Larry for Ron Paul? Ron Paul or Rand Paul mm-hmm you know we've got 17
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:16.560]  trillion dollars in debt we bailed out all these people that are too big to
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:25.080]  jail when they pay this money back how come they the national debt 17 trillion
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.160]  isn't going down what what does that money go does it go back into the general
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:34.800]  fund and they spend it again why you know General Motors are supposed to pay
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:40.160]  this all back why is this 17 trillion number not going down well that's a
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:43.120]  that's money that we're spending on everything that's not just the bailout
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.760]  and of course they said they paid us back but it would they paid us back with
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:51.280]  essentially 0% interest loans that the Fed was extending to the large central
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:55.760]  bankers that we had bailed out so we said here's a 0% loan they said thank you
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:58.480]  and they just passed the fiat currency back over the other table the whole
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:02.720]  thing is such a fraud it's just just amazing let's go to Richard in Arizona
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.720]  thank you Larry let's go to Richard in Arizona Richard had a comment about the
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:11.080]  Constitution yeah thanks David hi David and Paul I had something I guess I'm
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:16.480]  one of the cohorts still alive in Arizona so I just wanted to mention
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:20.920]  something about all this illegal activity by not only Obama but most of the
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:25.480]  presidents of the last hundred years and and the not only the presidents but the
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.880]  departments and the agencies that are used by the federal government to do
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:32.960]  things that are otherwise illegal for the federal government to do and I don't
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:39.000]  believe you can legally even do that so what I want to bring up is that there's
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.240]  something in the Constitution called the enumerated powers very specifically
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:47.520]  worded so that nothing but things on that list can never be done by the
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:52.480]  federal government and I believe that hiring an agency or a contractor or
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:57.440]  somebody else to your illegal activity is doesn't make it legal so we're all
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:03.400]  the lawyers and the law students and the common law people not attacking that at
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:08.200]  the root which would eliminate 98% of all their activities well you know we've
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:12.840]  taken the position that the Constitution that everything was prohibited to the
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:17.200]  central government unless they had explicit permission that's essentially
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.360]  the 9th and 10th amendment they've turned that on its head now they've
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:26.520]  inverted the Constitution and for us everything is prohibited unless they
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:30.720]  explicitly permitted expressly permitted we can see that with alcohol
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:34.240]  prohibition and the war on drugs it took a constitutional amendment to
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.320]  prohibit alcohol at a time a hundred years or so ago when they respected the
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:41.080]  Constitution we had another constitutional amendment that said okay you
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.400]  can now have alcohol but then they come along a little while after that and
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:51.160]  they just arbitrarily start making drugs illegal whether it's prescription drugs
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:54.960]  or whether it was recreational drugs they had no authority to do that if they
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.920]  did they wouldn't have needed a prohibition amendment for alcohol but
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:02.320]  they quite frankly don't care about the Constitution do you want a comment on
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:07.280]  that Paul yeah I mean as far as my understanding goes they just broadly
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.320]  interpret all these limitations and that's how they get through what they
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:15.240]  want to get through so as long as they can rhetorically argue that they're
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:20.320]  limiting themselves to it somewhat then you know they can deceive people just
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:24.920]  as people like Jonathan Gruber do with their rhetoric so it's it's a con game
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:28.320]  based on lexic on the rhetoric is normally how they get these things done
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.840]  yeah they have some things like the Commerce Clause that they try to argue
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:36.320]  from but it is the same kind of tortured logic that we see from Jonathan
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:41.400]  Gruber over and over again and that really doesn't pass muster it doesn't
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.400]  pass the amendments that are there they're very clear we're gonna be right
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:47.800]  back take your calls in this next segment the bottom of the hour we're

[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.920]  caused the last financial crisis were never fixed in fact they're even worse
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:16.480]  now the total amount of debt in the US has grown by more than 57% since
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:21.560]  September 2008 the two big to fail banks are much larger and the massive
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:25.840]  derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:29.760]  to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming

[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:30.840]  outgoing governor of Texas and the incoming governor of Texas are both
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.760]  saying that Texas might sue Barack Obama I don't know I'm seeing all these
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.240]  articles that say that you know what Obama is doing is a slap in the face to
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.000]  the Republicans they feel slighted they weren't consulted it's like this is
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:48.080]  not a soap opera about their personal feelings and you know Paul when I look
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:52.680]  at Rick Perry and Abbott saying that they're going to sue Obama because this
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:57.760]  is going to be expensive in terms of securing the border in terms of the
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.880]  cost of illegal aliens who come here on welfare it's not about that either I'm
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:07.120]  kind of tired of seeing these Republican politicians like Boehner say
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:10.440]  we're going to sue him that's not the rightful remedy these people have
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:14.800]  political power they have power in the Congress and especially governors have
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:20.440]  power local politicians have power if they have the backbone to use it that's
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:25.360]  the rightful remedy they need to stand up and take direct direct action instead
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.280]  of saying well we're going to take it to the courts because I think that allows
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:32.880]  them to essentially kind of wash their hands of the whole issue and say well
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:38.800]  I did what I could but the politically appointed judges sided with Obama what's
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:43.080]  your take on it I think one of the methods that I read I think it was
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.640]  Cruz that said it in his editorial was that they would introduce bills and
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.400]  amendments that would block funding for example for the Department of Homeland
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:55.880]  Security if this executive order was passed so I mean that would really be
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:00.040]  of concern to them because we remember three years ago with the TSA in Texas I
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.120]  mean they threatened a federal blockade they threatened to close down air traffic
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:10.080]  above Texas if those pat down grope down provisions were rolled back for the TSA
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.520]  in Texas that really scared them so if you actually go after something like the
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:18.720]  Department of Homeland Security that could really have an effect talking
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.160]  about suing Obama personally you know that could drag on for years as you
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.320]  said it seems really weak it seems like it's not going to get the job done
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:30.840]  interesting story on that subject though just come out on a before-job border
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:35.680]  patrol agent says will not enforce Obama's unlawful amnesty and this is a
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:40.880]  border patrol agent in California who says quote unlawful order as a border
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:45.240]  patrol agent I will not enforce implement or support in any way an executive
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:49.160]  order that attempts to give amnesty to illegal aliens I would rather have
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:54.720]  honor than my job so the very people on the front lines are now revolting
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:57.920]  against this we also have a sheriff's that say they're going to march on
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.560]  Washington who's saying that the plan of amnesty that Obama is coming up is
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:06.600]  actually quote the destruction of our democracy that it's a gaping hole for
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:09.920]  terrorists it'll be interesting to see I seriously doubt that Ted Cruz is going
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:13.760]  to be able to get the Republican Party to withhold one penny from Homeland
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:17.560]  Security because they love them so much but we'll see if that happens I wish
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.240]  they would stand up and do something they have no problem standing up nine
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:25.600]  times for their corporate interest to try to get the pipeline through the
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.600]  Keystone pipeline but they won't do anything to try to stop Obama they
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:35.240]  merely use him as a foil to get themselves elected to office let's go to a
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:40.600]  caller here Kelly in Texas you want to talk about amnesty yeah yeah God bless
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:44.280]  you both thank you for having me up you know for the life of me I cannot wrap
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:49.280]  my head around why Obama and Holder and the Clintons and the Bushes aren't
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:55.440]  present they are they I mean it's it's beyond impeachment it's beyond losses
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:58.920]  oh yes I mean they're responsible for murders
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:04.880]  assassinations and and the people they just get away with it I can't get my
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:08.120]  head around it speaks to the open corruption of our government doesn't it
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:13.680]  yes it does but when are we is God very many women gonna stand up against this
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:19.600]  kind of crap but in a nice way when we have a man down in Florida who's doing
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:24.000]  what's commanded by Christ to do yes being thrown in jail and yet these
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:31.360]  people are left to continue to rape and pillage America and murder and again I
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:34.920]  would go back I would go back to the it's a bipartisan thing and I would go
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:40.760]  back to the Terry Shavo thing I hope that comes up anybody who considers
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:46.480]  voting for Jeb Bush needs to go back and revisit that episode and look at what
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:53.080]  happened to Terry Shavo Jeb Bush could have overridden the orders of a probate
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:57.800]  court judge who was basically starving that poor woman to death and he didn't
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.720]  lift a finger to do anything to help her thank you so much for calling let's
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:09.160]  go to Bob in Texas Bob you have a Obama solution for us yes sir go ahead
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:12.840]  hear me yes go ahead you're online oh great how are y'all doing today doing
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:17.680]  good what's your solution well Obama you know the Republic is you can't even give
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:21.240]  them a victory you can't give them power you know first they complain well we
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:23.920]  can't do nothing we don't have a majority you give them a majority and
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:26.680]  they're still gonna have excuses for why they're not gonna do things I think
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:30.720]  that's pointless to go through and that fella down in Florida trying to feed
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:34.520]  those those people that is just ridiculous have you ever heard of the

[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:43.960]  ground before we do I want to let you know that this hour the Alex Jones show
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:49.760]  is brought to you by Silver Bullet it's now back we had run out of it it's now
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.640]  in limited supply get it right now because it takes about six weeks to get
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:59.480]  more of it in it's going to sell out pretty quickly it's a difficult long
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:04.000]  process to make this because we use a very high concentration it's
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.040]  concentrated to 30 parts per million in a pure base of deionized water so it's a
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:13.840]  very involved process involving high-voltage electrical process that
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:18.040]  generates minute-sized particles it's widely known the colloidal silver is a
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.880]  vital supplement for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and now we have it at

[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:43.360]  there's never been a more important time to have this powerful and clean form of

[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:02.440]  reporters and Ferguson but before we do I wanted to just finish up I cut off Bob in
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:05.920]  Texas real quick he had just brought up something he want to talk about go ahead
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:09.320]  Bob you still on the line? I am. Yes go ahead what do you want to say about that?
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:12.440]  You've heard about the Christmas truce I don't know if everybody knows about that
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:15.360]  during World War I when the soldiers decided they were gonna put down their
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:18.840]  arms and not kill each other anymore. There's been some good movies made about that.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:23.160]  Those soldiers the generals and stuff had to replace those soldiers because they
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:26.800]  wouldn't kill each other anymore that's what we need to see David is more people
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:30.600]  on the inside who are serving this system to stand up and say no it's just
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:33.640]  like all these pilots who are spraying us with all these chemtrails every day
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:37.400]  they need to stand up and say no I'm not gonna do that anymore that's what is
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:41.480]  most disappointing me to see the people who continue to serve this evil. That's
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:44.320]  right and you know when you talk about that and the reason I wanted to come
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:47.960]  back to you was because we just had the 25th anniversary of the fall of the
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:53.480]  Berlin Wall and it was soldiers at the border who refused to shoot people who
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.520]  wanted to cross and who were the people that were showing up there there were
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:00.560]  people who were coming from prayer meetings and churches where they had
[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:05.240]  been meeting for seven years in some cases turning out by the tens of
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:10.720]  thousands finally having enough so yeah it's gonna take a spiritual revival it's
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.400]  gonna take people who are the instruments of the oppressors to say I'm not
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:18.880]  going to be their tool anymore and stand up to them thank you so much for
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:24.240]  calling Bob in Texas we need to move on to our reporters in Ferguson Missouri
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:29.120]  we've got Joe Biggs there on the ground Joe what do you guys been seeing the
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:34.360]  last couple of days you filed a report last night about some small riots. Joe
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.640]  Biggs we are actually on South Florson Avenue right across from the police
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.640]  station and the fire department in Ferguson Missouri yes last night I got
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:50.440]  a call around 845 saying that there was a standoff between protesters and police
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:55.320]  officers here right between the police station and the fire department there's
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:59.280]  a little barricade set up over there and the police were standing behind there by
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:05.400]  the time we got here there were maybe 65 officers in you know low I would say
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:09.880]  lower grade riot gear with just the shields and some having to face masks
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:14.920]  with a gas mask on their side so 65 police officers to about a hundred
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.720]  protesters that were here now the interesting thing that happened last
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:23.080]  night though everybody was over off of the road on the other side where the
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.080]  grass is and the police officers were behind the barricade well they came
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:30.400]  around from the other side of the barricade and then started pushing the
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.440]  protesters into the road now they were just told 30 minutes prior to that if
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:38.880]  they get in the road that would be considered unlawful and that the police
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.920]  would use force the police came out and pushed us all into the road and then
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:48.880]  began arresting people in the street hey it sounds like what happened in the
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:55.640]  JFK 50th commemoration last year when they told everybody that was there in
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:59.400]  the crowd with info wars gave them access into an area and then sent the
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:03.880]  goons out to attack them yeah they pushed us out in Jakarta Jackson and I
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:07.240]  walking backwards filming and they're like get out of here get out here and
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:10.040]  make where do you want us to go go to the road then as soon as we went to the
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:13.960]  road the police ran out and just started snatching people up and then pushing
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:17.520]  them behind their line to where they would be arrested or whatever release you
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:22.960]  know soon so it was crazy they pushed us into an area that was unlawful so they
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.440]  could just go out and arrest people I've never seen that that was that was just
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:30.640]  crazy it's just amazing and you know that's one of the things that really
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.080]  concerns me about this we have seen so many cases of police brutality we were
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.480]  talking earlier in the program to Arnold Abbott the 90-year-old veteran who's
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:44.680]  been feeding the homeless and in Florida in Fort Lauderdale and we're talking
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:48.320]  about the many ways that they have come against the homeless you know beating
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:54.040]  Kelly Thomas to death shooting others into Mexico and Michigan and yet in
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:58.080]  Ferguson what they've done is they've not made it about the rules of
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:02.840]  engagement when it is allowed for the police to use lethal force or what
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:07.120]  level of force they should use instead they have successfully taken over this
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:12.680]  thing and made it all about race haven't they yes indeed I mean you hear a lot of
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:17.760]  talks you know on the social media a lot of chatter about how blacks are calling
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:21.480]  to the deaths of whites how whites are calling you know from the KKK for the
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:25.120]  deaths of blacks and things like that they're trying to create this racial
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:29.680]  diversion to take away from the point that people originally came out here for
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:34.720]  and it's getting so much you know global attention that it's causing these
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:39.720]  uprisings you know with protests all over and now they're expecting that when
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:44.320]  the the grand jury decision comes out if the officer isn't charged that there
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.960]  will be protests you know in New York Chicago Detroit LA you know I heard an
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.360]  activist saying that what they're planning in LA is going to be 10 times
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:57.080]  worse than anything that anybody's ever seen you know and and I can't say that
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:02.560]  it's just a lot of the bad police around here last night I heard some very awful
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.080]  things from some of the the protesters as well one of the guys walked up to a
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:10.120]  police officer and said hey he's like I said he's like I know that you have a
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:13.440]  daughter and he said he was in a sodomizer you know that doesn't help
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.680]  the problem whatsoever you know when you're out here and it's 65 to 100 and
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:23.080]  so far it's pretty calm and quiet you know and then you go out and you're
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:26.040]  you're doing that you're provoking I mean what kind of action what kind of
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:29.560]  response do you expect to happen from the police officer well you know Joe
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:33.240]  threatening the daughters yeah they use agent provocateurs on both sides of
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:36.120]  the fence don't they and of course what the police did last night was very
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:40.280]  provocative tonight on the nightly news Darren McBreen is going to be
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:43.920]  interviewing Larry Pinkney of course he was with the old former of the original
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:47.840]  black Panthers and as he's pointed out many times in interviews with us when
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:51.600]  they came against them was when they started uniting the entire community
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:55.480]  when they were no longer just focused on black people but they were uniting
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:58.000]  everybody in the community that's when they got really dangerous and the
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.080]  interesting thing is going to be on the on the nightly news tonight he got his
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:07.480]  FBI file and in the FBI file they talked about him being dangerous because he
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:12.000]  could appeal to both blacks and whites that's the issue if they can divide us
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:19.480]  by ethnicity then they win it's only when we can get them when we can come
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:23.920]  after them and say you're not going to have these kinds of rules of engagement
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:27.920]  we need to have accountability with the police and this is something that affects
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:32.360]  everybody not just one ethnic group I understand that black people have seen
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:36.160]  this far more than anybody else and I think they understand that more than
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.560]  anybody else the problem is is that because of that they're easily
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:45.400]  manipulated by the powers that be into thinking that this is simply a race war
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:52.000]  and it is not I mean at the end of the day it's about police officers you know
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:56.880]  going going out and doing this no-knock war it's going out and killing
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:01.360]  young Americans of all races you know going in and throwing flashbangs and
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:05.240]  ripping a child's chest open and going to the wrong place you know anytime we
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.960]  have a drawer or a war on drugs or a war on on terrorism all we do is make it
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:14.840]  worse you know this is like a war on terror on race and they're making it
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:20.000]  10 times worse yes and I understand that in the war on drugs the brunt of that
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.720]  has been borne by the poor people by the inner city people or the black people
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:29.240]  the majority of them go to jail for marijuana when oftentimes you don't
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:33.000]  see that same kind of incarceration rate with white people so I understand
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.720]  they've borne the brunt of that disproportionately but this is something
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:41.640]  that is destroying the legal framework of the entire country for everyone it's
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:46.240]  putting everyone in danger when we allow the government to assume these kind of
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:49.720]  authoritarian powers that we have allowed under the war on drugs that we're
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:53.560]  allowing under terrorism and now we're seeing these rules of engagement that
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:58.240]  the federal government is training local police departments to engage in we see
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:03.220]  that there's no longer a restraint on the use of force let me I've got Paul
[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:06.440]  Joseph Watson on the line here and I want to see if Paul do you have any
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:10.000]  questions for Joe that you wanted to ask him about what's going on in Ferguson
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.200]  yeah well basically obviously we're expecting the grand jury to come to a
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:18.320]  decision tomorrow that's not going to be announced until Sunday at the earliest
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:22.160]  if they do come to that decision so I just wanted to ask Joe you know we've
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.880]  got these reports about militant groups going after officer Darren Wilson
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.360]  directly we've got lists of targets which include power substations water
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.840]  treatment facilities Joe from being on the ground there back in August compared
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:39.600]  to now do you expect there to be a similar level of violence in reaction to
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:44.040]  this expected acquittal or do you think it's more likely to be more subdued this
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:49.080]  time well from what the from the from the action the reaction of the police
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:53.080]  officers that I saw last night they were a I would say a little bit more well
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:58.320]  trained and how they did act and how they did approach people instead of just
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:01.720]  you know sporadically running out and like attacking the crowd like they did
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:04.760]  back in August so I think there's going to be a different way that the police
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:10.280]  handle but you know back in Halloween this year they called him a vandal and
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:15.360]  the local Fox News actually shut down a power area and it shut down the power
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:18.760]  to the fire department the police station here so it seems like that was
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:22.120]  almost like a training exercise for something bigger to come you know I
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.560]  don't think it's too far fetched that a militant group could shut down the
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:29.360]  Emerson Electric Company which is just right up the road a couple miles so I
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:36.040]  expect things to be bad but I don't know if they'll will be as as bad as in
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.880]  August and when I say that I mean that in the amount of people coming out
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:43.320]  because you guys remember back in August at one point there was like two three
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:46.480]  thousand people out in the streets I don't think it's going to be like that
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.480]  because it was unorganized this time you have more well organized protest groups
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:55.720]  whatever you want to call in militants who have been organizing the past few
[02:44:55.720 --> 02:44:59.680]  months preparing coming up with game plans on their action if the verdict
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.480]  comes down that Darren Wilson will not be charged so I think you have more
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.160]  coordinated attacks so to say that could happen and that's something that we're
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:11.600]  going to have to be watchful for in the near future you know as we look at this
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:15.200]  I want you guys to give me your thoughts on the timing of this because of
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:20.960]  course this is likely to happen tomorrow I know that it's a jury but it is in
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:24.640]  fact a grand jury grand jury's are known for being rubber stamps of the
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:28.160]  government of the prosecution so the timing of this coming out right after
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:33.120]  Obama makes his pronouncement do you think that there's some conclusion there
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.840]  to try to wash wash out the the story of Obama's amnesty to wash that out of
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:42.080]  the headlines yeah they're going to use the Obama's amnesty plan they're going
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:46.920]  to use Ferguson as a they're going to use Ferguson as a burka to cover up the
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:51.520]  amnesty plan that's going to go on here I think so what do you think Paul you
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:55.680]  think this is deliberate timing yeah I mean I made that point there's actually
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:00.400]  a headline out of the Washington Times will Ferguson race riots help Obama so
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:04.440]  you know Rahm Emanuel never let a good crisis go to waste if they can use this
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:09.680]  as a distraction from the fury over executive amnesty then they will do so
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:13.560]  and you know Obama came out quite visibly early on and offered his
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:18.600]  condolences to Michael Brown's family that caused resentment amongst officer
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:22.120]  Darren Wilson supporters who said that he should also at least give some words
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:27.440]  for his plight he's obviously now being targeted with death threats so from the
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:31.480]  administration itself they've come down on one side we know that Obama met with
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:36.480]  some of the Ferguson protesters so the administration is using this to cause
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:40.960]  more division amidst an already divisive environment with this amnesty
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:45.680]  program so that's definitely in the offing to exploit this crisis as a
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:54.440]  distraction from the amnesty program you know I remember when this oh yeah I
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:57.840]  remember when the story first broke it was on the weekend I think I was doing
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:02.840]  the radio show and it looked initially like another one of these cases of
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.040]  unjustified use of force of over-the-top use of force and they allowed that
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:11.960]  narrative to set there for a long time a long time before they came out and
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:16.280]  showed any evidence that would have exonerated the police officer there
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:21.160]  they engaged in character assassination openly talking about that before they
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:26.520]  showed any evidence that would justify the officers shooting so it seems to me
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:31.240]  that if they had that evidence and they certainly needed to have it certainly
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:36.920]  would have had that evidence if it wasn't in fact manufactured there's
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:40.240]  something interesting to happen last night to that I almost forgot to say
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:45.800]  last night there were I think five live streamers in the area four local that
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:49.800]  live here in Ferguson in the area and then myself as a police advance on us
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:53.520]  there were a lot of people in the Twitter verse on Facebook that had all of the
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:56.480]  live streams up for once now the interesting thing that happened last
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:59.960]  night right as a police advance on the road and started throwing people to the
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:04.120]  ground and arresting them all of us lost our live feed all of us had our phones
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.600]  shut down we weren't able to transmit any more for quite some time and then it
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:11.800]  took a few minutes to get it back up as well so I thought that was weird that was
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:15.120]  coordinated all of the live streamers because all the people I've been getting
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:18.800]  tweets all day and in the last night saying that hey we were watching all
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:22.800]  five of them the same time and all of you went out at the exact same time right
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:26.680]  as a police came into the street and do it and started arresting people clearly
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:30.120]  a case of them using selective shutdown of an area and we saw that the Bundy
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.720]  Ranch as well when I was out there with Josh all through the week we couldn't
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:39.040]  get any reception whatsoever we had to go get Wi-Fi at the Bundy Ranch to upload
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:41.880]  our reports to do our interviews we couldn't get anything at the protest
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:47.240]  site and then magically was that I'm glad you brought that up there was a young
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:51.680]  lady here last night and she was really mad about the fact that she's like why
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:55.600]  aren't Americans standing up for our cause just like they did at the Bundy
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:00.120]  Ranch she said men and women came from all over the US and went to that ranch
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:05.440]  armed and stood up against those police officers against the BLM why aren't they
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:09.120]  coming here and supporting us as well she says it's the same thing as
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:13.040]  brutality it's big government trying to come and take over and push you around
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:16.880]  stripping of your liberties and she was wondering why people aren't coming here
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:20.680]  to help support them as well and their cause against militarized police and
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:24.440]  Ferguson well that's an interesting point I was gonna say that you know on
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:29.320]  the on the day that the government had orchestrated saying that they were
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:35.720]  going to remove the regulations for the Bundy family on that day they turned
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:39.360]  everything on we could get cell reception everywhere and then they
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:42.760]  selectively turned it back off but it is a good point I think that it is
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:45.360]  something when we were at the Bundy Ranch people were saying oh you're not
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:48.800]  gonna show up and cover it when something happens in the inner city is
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:52.160]  like well we've been doing that all along we heard the same thing there at
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.720]  the Bundy Ranch that people wouldn't show up I think people are showing up I
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:59.240]  don't know if it's the same people that were there at the Bundy Ranch that are
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:04.040]  showing up in in Ferguson but there are people who are concerned about it who do
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:09.200]  see that this is a problem that is not simply a racial divide and conquer
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:12.560]  problem but I think a lot of people have bought into that even people who might
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:17.000]  otherwise stand up for what what has happened there in terms of the rules of
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.120]  engagement Paul do you want to say anything about that yeah well just on
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:23.840]  the telecommunications thing that the shutdown we know I think it was Apple
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.760]  had a patent where they could shut down people's cameras on their phones during
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:33.120]  a concert where they didn't want copyrighted footage to be videotaped so

[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.680]  with us in the UK we're gonna be joined in just a moment with Jakari Jackson and
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:25.800]  Ferguson Missouri now as we were talking to Joe Biggs who is also in
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:31.000]  Ferguson Missouri who's talking about how everybody at the small encounter
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  small riot that they had last night everybody that was live streaming lost
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.400]  their feeds at exactly the same time in other words they could have easily have
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:44.880]  shut down a cell phone area there but Paul had mentioned that of course Apple
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:48.600]  has been granted a patent to disable everything on your phone so that you
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:53.000]  would not even be able to take footage that you could later upload and of course
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.240]  we don't know if they've implemented that yet or not this is a story that was
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:01.160]  written by his brother Steve Watson going back to September 3rd 2012 but of
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:06.520]  course we just learned today from the Washington Post that the next step in
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:11.760]  cell phone tracking is going to be determining your altitude they're not
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:16.960]  content to just know where you are on an XY grid to know here coordinates that
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:21.640]  way they want to know what floor you're on yes this is something new that is a
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:26.480]  capability they say of the iPhone 6 from Apple and some of the new Android
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:31.200]  devices they're going to use the new barometric pressure sensors and this is
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:35.960]  a rule that's being driven by the FCC they say well we need to have it for 911
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:40.120]  calls so we'll know what floor the person is on really is that what you're
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:44.040]  going to use it for we know what you're going to use it for they also go into
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:48.680]  this and say well it's got some legitimate uses malls could use altitude
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:53.280]  tracking to monitor crowd flows and send coupons to the phones of customers
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:58.800]  walking past a shoe shop on the top floor or multi-level casinos could monitor
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:02.480]  gamblers for security purposes or companies to keep better tabs on the
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:07.880]  movements of their employees in other words we are their inventory where they're
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:12.480]  cattle they want to watch us wherever we go so that they always know that they
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:16.800]  can push something on us or grab us at a moment's notice and just one more thing
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:21.720]  and I'll go back to up to Jacar and Ferguson they just had a case in
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:27.200]  Baltimore where someone was arrested because they got his cell phone location
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:31.000]  the judge wanted to know how they got that and they refused to tell the judge
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.280]  they said no we have a nondisclosure agreement he goes you don't have a
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:37.800]  nondisclosure agreement with me give me the information or I'm going to hold you
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:41.480]  in contempt of court they said well forget it then and we'll let the guy go
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:45.120]  free see that's their priority their priority is not to protect you their
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:51.200]  priority is to protect their surveillance measures and to defend the
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:55.080]  corporations that essentially run this government with their nondisclosure
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:01.360]  agreements let's go to Jacar Jackson and Ferguson to car to car jacks reporting
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:05.280]  Ferguson Missouri we are in front of the police station where you guys saw the
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:08.480]  video last night where the police officers push people into the streets
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:12.920]  now we'll say this time around we're besides in them shoving everybody out
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:17.120]  into the streets the officers last night were better behaved and what we saw
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:21.920]  back in August no tear gas no rubber bullets nothing like that so we've
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:26.520]  seen this is the second protest we're at last night since we've been here it's
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:29.720]  getting warmer and warmer temperatures so people are coming out longer I think
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:32.600]  the first one we went to only lasts about 20 or 30 minutes because it was
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:36.760]  about 17 degrees at the time now it's up to about 50 so the protests are
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:40.200]  lasting a little bit longer the thing that they seem to be doing this time
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:43.840]  around is blocking off the streets because when we were originally here
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:46.840]  back in August the police had a lot of the streets blocked off and then blame
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:51.000]  the protesters for it but now the the protesters are coming out and purposely
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:54.240]  blocking the streets peacefully but they are blocking the streets and the police
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:57.880]  come out there and try to remove them the best they can and I wasn't live
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:01.320]  streaming at the time as Joe lost his signal but many of the people in the
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:05.280]  crowd was saying that yes in fact they all simultaneously lost their live
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:09.440]  stream luckily I was filming on our camera so I had a backup for that
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:13.760]  contingency but you know as we continue to move on and as the verdict gets
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:16.800]  closer you know we're going to be here throughout the weekend to document
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:21.000]  whatever happens and we'll be here at least till Sunday possibly longer if
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:25.200]  necessary to bring all our viewers and all the people who are supporting us in

[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:44.920]  Texas Barbara in Illinois John in California Bill in Pennsylvania Stephen

[03:00:55.080 --> 03:01:01.920]  used to live in st. Louis Missouri and the problem is is that it was a bunch of
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:09.800]  bombs m of 44 I go make my deliveries and I got video of it I mean it was a
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:18.520]  convoy of trucks and I mean truck all over the place and I turn around and
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:26.000]  and then I saw troop carriers with reservists in there going up to off of
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  the furthest of west force I just want to say it was well so they're loaded for
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.040]  bear they're really mobilizing and it looks like this could be a real powder
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:38.120]  keg it's that's interesting well we're gonna have our reporters are there
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:41.120]  they're going to be giving us life you know thank you Bill in Texas
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:45.160]  Barbara in Illinois go ahead
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:50.480]  Barbara you saw all of my life as long as I've been able to understand I believe
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:54.960]  that the president could issue an executive order to restore law and order
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:02:01.160]  in our country yeah it's a yeah yeah he's he's issued executive order about
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:07.640]  just about everything except that hasn't he and I'm 92 years old now yeah and I
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:12.760]  don't like what's happening no somebody's got to do something yeah oh I
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.240]  agree I wish they would and like I pointed out before they keep saying well
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:18.920]  our hands are tied we can't do anything there's so there's no point in even
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:24.680]  trying to come up with impeachment or to come after them for criminal operations
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:30.320]  when they target people using the IRS as a as a political weapon or because of
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:35.040]  Benghazi they won't do any criminal investigations they won't impeach anybody
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:38.720]  they won't do anything except use it for their own political advantage and we can
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:42.640]  see that in the fact that they have brought up keystone pipeline legislation
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:46.880]  nine times knowing they can't get that passed but they won't do anything to try
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:50.000]  to reign in Obama thank you so much Barbara let's move along so we try to
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:56.520]  get everybody on here John in California go ahead John David you hear me yes I
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:02:59.960]  hear you go ahead you're on okay great I didn't hear the scratch all right you're
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:04.040]  doing a great job David by the way thank you maybe you should switch with Alex
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:09.520]  and you take the daily broadcast he take the nightly news I want to follow up
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:14.800]  with what that woman just said the political option is off the table we
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:22.120]  tried in 2008 we tried in 2012 so now we got to go from the ballot box to the
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:27.440]  military solution all military officers that can hear my voice that will work in
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:33.200]  or near the Pentagon must immediately implement the U.S. version of Operation
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:38.840]  Valkyrie we don't know what the code name of the actual U.S. operation is but
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:43.360]  you must do it I understand I still think I still think that there is some
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:48.600]  options if we can get honest people in at the lower levels of government we've
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:54.400]  seen changes made in terms of ballot issues passed we have some areas we've
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:58.280]  got sheriff's who will stand up I don't think it's we're gonna get any political
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:01.560]  solutions out of Washington I agree with that I don't think we're gonna find
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:04.760]  anybody running for president I think we're finding any congressman we do
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:07.680]  have some honest congressmen but they're not the ones who are in charge there I
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:12.360]  think it's gonna have to be stopped by our governors at the state area and it's
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:16.500]  gonna have to be stopped by people who are sheriffs and we need to see the
[03:04:16.500 --> 03:04:21.120]  people who have legitimate authority and they do have legitimate authority using

[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:30.400]  vote as jurors to stand up against unjustified laws and defend each other
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:34.720]  in juries we're not even doing that so until we can see somebody stand up and
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:39.280]  do that I think it's gonna be very difficult to take a bullet box option
