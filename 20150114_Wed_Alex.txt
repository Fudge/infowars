[00:00.000 --> 00:08.520]  Appeared before the congressional committee, the highest representation of the American
[00:08.520 --> 00:14.040]  people under subpoena to tell what I knew of activities, which I believe might lead
[00:14.040 --> 00:16.560]  to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[00:16.560 --> 00:21.880]  Does America owe its edge in military technology to Nazi war criminals brought here after World
[00:21.880 --> 00:22.880]  War II?
[00:22.880 --> 00:28.400]  The truth is, the thousands of former Nazis, some of whom committed atrocities, went to
[00:28.400 --> 00:30.880]  work for the United States government.
[00:30.880 --> 00:42.400]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks?
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.960]  This I think gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like
[00:46.960 --> 00:49.040]  to get into in the executive session.
[00:49.040 --> 00:56.400]  At CBS we had been contacted by the CIA, as a matter of fact by the time I became the
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.480]  head of the whole News and Public Affairs operation in 1954, the ships had been established
[01:01.480 --> 01:04.400]  and I was told about them and asked if I'd carry on with them.
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.440]  We're really talking about intelligence at the highest levels of the US government, setting
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.120]  the broad direction for the nation.
[01:11.120 --> 01:18.560]  Have you brought with you some of those devices which would have enabled the CIA to use this
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.520]  poison for, we have indeed, for killing people?
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.400]  But also the toxin itself would not appear in the autopsy?
[01:27.400 --> 01:28.400]  Yes.
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.120]  But when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.880]  If you've been anywhere near a television set or a radio these past few hours, you already
[01:37.880 --> 01:41.560]  know that John Lennon of the Beatles is dead.
[01:41.560 --> 01:47.400]  He was shot late this evening in front of his apartment building in New York City.
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.440]  Despite evidence that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking, Bush kept Noriega on
[01:52.440 --> 01:53.440]  the payroll.
[01:53.440 --> 01:57.360]  We interrupt your regular programming to tell you of a plane crash in northeastern Minnesota
[01:57.360 --> 02:00.560]  where we have just had confirmed a short while ago.
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.520]  Eight people were killed on a small beach aircraft that was on its way to Evelyneth,
[02:05.520 --> 02:10.640]  Minnesota, including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, and according to the senior
[02:10.640 --> 02:16.160]  staff in the senator's office, not only the senator but his wife Sheila, his daughter,
[02:16.160 --> 02:19.680]  three members of his staff, and the two pilots.
[02:19.680 --> 02:25.160]  The CIA has been, and is now, completely out of control.
[02:25.160 --> 02:32.240]  The accusation is that drugs are being sold by the Contras and that the CIA knew about
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.240]  it and didn't do anything.
[02:35.240 --> 02:57.480]  An assassination attempt, the president was hit, but pushed immediately into the limousine
[02:57.480 --> 02:58.720]  and rushed to the hospital.
[02:58.720 --> 03:02.000]  William Colby has been missing since April 27.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.800]  This canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Waikomiko River, April 28.
[03:06.800 --> 03:10.800]  He's missing and presumed drowned at the United States tonight, declared in effect
[03:10.800 --> 03:15.760]  that Panama's General Manuel Noriega is a threat to this country's national security.
[03:15.760 --> 03:22.840]  When George Bush became director of the CIA in 1976, he inherited Noriega as a contact.
[03:22.840 --> 03:30.160]  When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related, indicted dictator, discount
[03:30.160 --> 03:37.160]  they are total lies.
[03:37.160 --> 03:50.480]  In 1976, flight 455, which took off from Venezuela bound for Cuba, suddenly exploded.
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.160]  All 73 passengers and five crew members aboard died after the plane crashed near Barbados.
[03:56.160 --> 04:16.880]  More of the terrorists were found to be Latin Americans contracted by the U.S., one of the
[04:16.880 --> 04:28.400]  attacks masterminds, Polsada Capriles, currently lives freely in Miami.
[04:28.400 --> 04:33.640]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.560]  I will tell you, Director Doit has a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective that
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.280]  the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[04:42.280 --> 04:51.640]  That is just part of a powerful new video montage put together by Darren McBrain that
[04:51.640 --> 04:56.160]  we're going to air in its entirety later in the transmission.
[04:56.160 --> 05:00.920]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Wednesday edition, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[05:00.920 --> 05:03.520]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.200]  And the truth is, it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our
[05:08.200 --> 05:11.960]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[05:11.960 --> 05:16.680]  Even with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I've found that super high-quality nutraceuticals,
[05:16.680 --> 05:21.240]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked, I can
[05:21.240 --> 05:25.520]  see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[05:25.520 --> 05:28.080]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[05:28.080 --> 05:32.400]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the M4Ware's Life Resolution Pack, combining
[05:32.400 --> 05:38.160]  three essential formulations, oxygen-based cleanser oxy-powder, the secret 12 bioavailable

[07:00.760 --> 07:05.840]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more
[07:05.840 --> 07:10.160]  and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[07:10.160 --> 07:14.600]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2-5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[07:14.600 --> 07:19.640]  outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[07:19.640 --> 07:20.640]  within their homes.
[07:20.640 --> 07:24.040]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[07:24.040 --> 07:28.560]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew link to numerous conditions, and don't forget
[07:28.560 --> 07:32.200]  the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.680]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[07:36.680 --> 07:41.680]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[07:41.680 --> 07:42.680]  back against.
[07:42.680 --> 07:47.800]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new Infowars
[07:47.800 --> 07:52.160]  Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.480]  any toxic environment.
[07:53.480 --> 08:18.160]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[08:18.160 --> 08:24.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance,
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[08:29.520 --> 08:38.000]  Successful financial analyst, best-selling author, formerly Bain Capital, Mr. Dent.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  Harry Dent will be joining us to look at the world economy with more and more top experts
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.520]  saying we're sliding into a global depression, not a recession.
[08:48.520 --> 08:53.560]  Also the former head of policy and the former editor, chief editor of the Wall Street Journal,
[08:53.560 --> 08:59.640]  the father of ergonomics, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.080]  of the first hour of the second hour.
[09:04.080 --> 09:10.600]  There is so much to get to today here, I don't even know where to start, there is just so
[09:10.600 --> 09:22.360]  much on so many different fronts, there's a new national poll out, troops turn on commander
[09:22.360 --> 09:29.800]  and chief deeply unpopular, in fact he's the most unpopular president with the military
[09:29.800 --> 09:36.440]  ever, the military times is reporting.
[09:36.440 --> 09:43.920]  We're going to be going over some of that news today, so he's incredibly unpopular
[09:43.920 --> 09:49.400]  across the board, he's incredibly unpopular with Democrats as well, Obamacare in national
[09:49.400 --> 09:56.480]  polls is over 80% unpopular when you poll both conservatives, independents and liberals.
[09:56.480 --> 10:02.480]  If you just poll liberals, the last numbers I saw was over 65% don't like it and it hasn't
[10:02.480 --> 10:08.960]  even been fully implemented yet, the massive premium increases, the massive deductible
[10:08.960 --> 10:16.880]  increases, the cutting of care, the rationing of care, the death panels, turning our healthcare
[10:16.880 --> 10:27.920]  system into a cross between the British national healthcare system and the VA.
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.920]  Many times in a special report, America's military, a conservative institution's an
[10:32.920 --> 10:44.200]  easy cultural evolution, oh it's an evolution and then there's Obama's mark on the military,
[10:44.200 --> 10:54.920]  less than 20% of the military polled, likes Obama.
[10:54.920 --> 10:59.320]  The president has never been popular with the military, but this approval among active
[10:59.320 --> 11:04.920]  duty troops has created and has cratered in the last year.
[11:04.920 --> 11:17.400]  It's gone from 37% at its high to now down to what 12% that approve and then in military
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.560]  culture you're not even supposed to as active duty disapprove publicly of the president,
[11:23.560 --> 11:30.800]  but still when polled, 60% disapprove.
[11:30.800 --> 11:41.560]  But it's almost 10%, it's hovering right above 10% that approve of the president now.
[11:41.560 --> 11:47.800]  The latest numbers, there's different polls out there but this particular one says 15%,
[11:47.800 --> 11:54.720]  if you put your cursor over it, approve and 55% disapprove.
[11:54.720 --> 12:01.640]  I was eyeballing the graph with my eyeballs and his first term President Obama oversaw
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.680]  repeal of the controversial Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, then he broke one of the military's
[12:06.680 --> 12:12.600]  most deeply rooted traditions and vowed to lift the ban on women serving in combat.
[12:12.600 --> 12:16.360]  And the commander in chief has aggressively sought to change military culture by cracking
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.200]  down sexual assault and sexual harassment problems that for years were underreported
[12:21.200 --> 12:22.200]  or overlooked.
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.840]  Well, the military always said don't stick a bunch of women in with a bunch of 20-year-old
[12:28.840 --> 12:36.360]  high testosterone males in the same barracks, you're going to have people having sex.
[12:36.360 --> 12:39.880]  And what's happening is they're getting pregnant, most of it's consensual.
[12:39.880 --> 12:45.200]  But yeah, you stick a woman naked in with a bunch of 20-year-old men.
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.200]  You bet they're going to get their butt grabbed.
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.280]  You bet they're going to get asked out every 30 seconds.
[12:51.280 --> 12:57.680]  You bet that there's going to be serious problems and this is all part of the social
[12:57.680 --> 13:04.480]  engineering to destabilize the military ahead of going to autonomous drones, autonomous
[13:04.480 --> 13:07.160]  ground combat robots, which is all being announced.
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.280]  Oh, the drone pilots are depressed, we're replacing them next year with robots.
[13:12.280 --> 13:15.600]  And guess what, for 10 years it's declassified this year.
[13:15.600 --> 13:23.320]  They just declassified it in late 2014, so now 2015, I have to say last year, that they're
[13:23.320 --> 13:27.080]  going to all autonomous with the robots making their own decisions.
[13:27.080 --> 13:32.080]  So this is just part of getting humans to fight with each other and to destabilize society,
[13:32.080 --> 13:40.120]  destabilize the family, break up the family, break up the culture at every level ahead
[13:40.120 --> 13:42.360]  of the next phase of social engineering.
[13:42.360 --> 13:44.920]  That's all that's going on here.
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.320]  And the real reason the military is upset with Obama is not over, don't ask, don't tell,
[13:50.320 --> 13:56.280]  even though that's meant to cause destabilization or putting women in frontline combat.
[13:56.280 --> 14:02.000]  Like I just saw yesterday where in the Navy and other branches, they're not going to make
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.880]  women cut their hair.
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.120]  See, men have to cut their hair, but women don't.
[14:08.120 --> 14:14.640]  Oh, and women don't have to be able to carry a 75-pound pack on a 40-mile hike.
[14:14.640 --> 14:17.880]  They now only have to carry a 30-pound pack.
[14:17.880 --> 14:21.320]  So the women get to carry a 30-pound pack and have their hair long.
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.600]  And we're going to cut how long you hike.
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.120]  And then I guess in combat, if you've got to put somebody on your shoulders that takes
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.120]  a strong man every ounce of will they've got to gut up in the testosterone and adrenaline
[14:34.120 --> 14:36.700]  and pick somebody up and carry him a mile.
[14:36.700 --> 14:38.680]  The average woman can't do that.
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.760]  The average man can't do that.
[14:40.760 --> 14:43.280]  That's why they have standards.
[14:43.280 --> 14:48.840]  But don't worry, women are going to get leave now from frontline combat when they're having
[14:48.840 --> 14:50.560]  their menstrual period.
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.240]  And they're going to be given medications to help them ease it.
[14:54.240 --> 14:59.200]  Can you imagine being in combat with a bunch of women?
[14:59.200 --> 15:04.440]  I mean, can you imagine that?
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.040]  I mean, do you know how much women fight with each other?
[15:08.040 --> 15:10.320]  I mean, let's just get real.
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.040]  Feminism wants you to deny reality.
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.720]  Men don't have uteruses and can't have babies.
[15:18.720 --> 15:25.240]  And women in no culture ever have been conscripted into frontline combat.
[15:25.240 --> 15:32.040]  Yes, when societies get overrun and when your country is falling, you will then start arming
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.360]  women and putting them into the fight.
[15:34.360 --> 15:41.400]  Hitler did that, conscripted hundreds of thousands of women in the defense of German
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.880]  cities with phosphorus-tipped RPGs.
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.440]  And I talked to old World War II vets that I'd deer hunt with or friends of my grandfather
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.720]  who would tell the stories of having to cut down women that, quote, looked like Marilyn
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.840]  Monroe and how much it upset them to cut women in half with their machine guns on top their
[16:01.840 --> 16:03.920]  tanks.
[16:03.920 --> 16:08.920]  Women told a story of this woman coming out in a black mink coat, looked like Marilyn
[16:08.920 --> 16:15.800]  Monroe, and they said, looks like she's got a weapon, got a weapon, and she opens it up
[16:15.800 --> 16:22.160]  and starts to raise a rifle and at 20 feet away with that machine gun on top that tank
[16:22.160 --> 16:24.720]  cut her in half.
[16:24.720 --> 16:25.720]  That's another thing.
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.040]  How barbarous is it to put women in combat?
[16:29.040 --> 16:32.240]  It's barbarous to put men into it, but if you've got to do it, you do it.
[16:32.240 --> 16:34.280]  Men are designed to kill.
[16:34.280 --> 16:35.800]  Men are designed to hunt.
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.960]  Men are designed to see other men getting killed around them and keep it together.
[16:40.960 --> 16:42.920]  Women are not designed for that.
[16:42.920 --> 16:49.480]  Women have three times the connections on average between left and right hemisphere of the brain.
[16:49.480 --> 16:51.280]  That makes them intuitive.
[16:51.280 --> 16:56.560]  It makes them be able to keep track of a lot of things in a family, but it does not on
[16:56.560 --> 17:05.040]  average give women a predisposition to be able to focus on one task at hand and carry
[17:05.040 --> 17:07.240]  it out like a man can.
[17:07.240 --> 17:08.240]  That's the difference.
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.800]  And they're now saying that's sexist to talk about brain scans they've had for 30 years
[17:13.800 --> 17:18.600]  and they've known this for even longer.
[17:18.600 --> 17:24.440]  In fact, there have been surgeries that have been done where they sever the connections
[17:24.440 --> 17:29.640]  between the left and right hemisphere in the cerebral cortex, and it will turn a man or
[17:29.640 --> 17:34.240]  a woman into a total and complete sociopath.
[17:34.240 --> 17:42.720]  There is a reason that men are several hundred times more predisposed to commit rape, to
[17:42.720 --> 17:46.560]  commit murder, to commit armed robbery.
[17:46.560 --> 17:50.560]  Most serial killers are men, so I'm not here saying men are better than women.
[17:50.560 --> 17:52.720]  We're just different.
[17:52.720 --> 17:56.600]  We have less connections between left and right hemisphere.
[17:56.600 --> 18:07.320]  That's why it's easier for us to become genetically of reborn predisposed psychopaths, sociopaths.
[18:07.320 --> 18:13.120]  But conversely, women are more easily manipulated in every major psychological study.
[18:13.120 --> 18:17.400]  Why do you think 81% of Western advertising targets women?
[18:17.400 --> 18:23.720]  Because you get more bang for your buck targeting women.
[18:23.720 --> 18:28.240]  I'm just giving you the secrets here of how women operate because I'm going off on a
[18:28.240 --> 18:31.720]  jag here just looking at this article.
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.480]  But the real reason the military is upset, let me give you the newsflash.
[18:36.480 --> 18:41.600]  The military for six years is being publicly trained for national gun confiscation and
[18:41.600 --> 18:47.560]  to be deployed domestically to take on gun owners, the Tea Party, returning veterans,
[18:47.560 --> 18:48.920]  libertarians, conservatives.
[18:48.920 --> 18:49.920]  It's been all over the news.
[18:49.920 --> 18:52.720]  We broke it six, seven years ago, but it's all over the news.
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.600]  Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Forbes, the war against the Tea Party.
[18:57.600 --> 19:00.640]  Pentagon prepares to fight its main enemy, the Tea Party.
[19:00.640 --> 19:02.680]  Its main enemy, the veterans.
[19:02.680 --> 19:08.560]  The military is being called in and being trained to take on the American people.
[19:08.560 --> 19:13.960]  They call the officers in and even noncommissioned to have meetings, bad-mouthing the founders,
[19:13.960 --> 19:19.960]  bad-mouthing George Washington, and the troops are sitting back going, I got a purple heart
[19:19.960 --> 19:26.360]  back at Barracks for when I got hit with shrapnel a few years ago in Afghanistan, and I was
[19:26.360 --> 19:30.120]  given a commendation and my daddy's got it won.
[19:30.120 --> 19:32.760]  George Washington's on it.
[19:32.760 --> 19:36.000]  He's on it because he founded the U.S. Army.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.640]  They're freaking out because they know our government's funding al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.680]  That's why Obama has a 10 to 15 percent approval rating in the U.S. military.
[19:45.680 --> 19:54.000]  Not because they're trying to, you know, turn it into a gay orgy or put women in front-line
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  combat.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.800]  It's all just to screw the military up.
[19:56.800 --> 20:01.360]  And the military knows that, because they're obsessed with gays.
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.200]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails,
[20:06.200 --> 20:09.560]  your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.

[20:28.160 --> 20:30.440]  enhancing health and privacy.
[20:30.440 --> 20:35.040]  The CDC just announced, flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus, you may not
[20:35.040 --> 20:36.040]  be protected.
[20:36.040 --> 20:39.840]  Whatever your lifestyle, your immune system is critical and imudine provides your immune
[20:39.840 --> 20:40.840]  support.
[20:40.840 --> 20:43.560]  Doctor recommended stimulant-free and not found in pharmacies.

[20:56.640 --> 21:00.400]  Remember, imudine is key support for your immune system.
[21:00.400 --> 21:02.920]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[21:02.920 --> 21:07.640]  And the truth is, it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our
[21:07.640 --> 21:11.360]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[21:11.360 --> 21:16.080]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high-quality nutraceuticals,
[21:16.080 --> 21:20.400]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked.
[21:20.400 --> 21:24.920]  I can see the drastic changes every day, with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[21:24.920 --> 21:27.400]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[21:27.400 --> 21:31.720]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWarsLife Resolution Pack, combining
[21:31.720 --> 21:37.480]  three essential formulations, oxygen-based cleanser oxy-powder, the secret 12 bioavailable

[21:42.560 --> 21:47.680]  at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true

[21:52.680 --> 21:59.880]  2015 is the year to do it, and it all starts at infowarslife.com.
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.800]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[22:01.800 --> 22:06.760]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[22:06.760 --> 22:11.040]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're
[22:11.040 --> 22:12.800]  making it easy for them.
[22:12.800 --> 22:17.480]  Almost every home security system, even though sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.760]  The phone line, you shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long-term contract, and think
[22:22.760 --> 22:23.760]  you're safe.
[22:23.760 --> 22:28.640]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip, and when a burglar cuts your
[22:28.640 --> 22:31.160]  phone line, you're defenseless.
[22:31.160 --> 22:33.400]  Simply Safe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[22:33.400 --> 22:38.000]  Built by Harvard engineers, Simply Safe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  Scissors can't cut it.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  And that means your home stays safe.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.360]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[23:55.440 --> 24:16.080]  Providing your basic needs to survive.
[24:16.080 --> 24:17.080]  Here's what I want to do.
[24:17.080 --> 24:24.560]  We've got the latest on the rollout of tyranny in response to the 20 dead in France.
[24:24.560 --> 24:26.800]  We've got the latest on Russia and the economy.
[24:26.800 --> 24:32.800]  We've got Harry Dent joining us to break that down in the third hour.
[24:32.800 --> 24:37.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, and of course Father
[24:37.280 --> 24:40.240]  Reaganomics is popping in for 20 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[24:40.240 --> 24:45.760]  But I do want to open the phones up in the shower for first-time callers who are specifically
[24:45.760 --> 24:52.160]  veterans or who are currently actively serving to correct me if I'm wrong.
[24:52.160 --> 24:57.200]  I've talked to thousands of vets over the last six, seven years of Obama.
[24:57.200 --> 24:59.640]  I have a lot of family that's currently in the military.
[24:59.640 --> 25:03.400]  I'll just leave it at that in very secretive operations.
[25:03.400 --> 25:05.320]  And they've relayed to me what's happening.
[25:05.320 --> 25:08.200]  I've talked to Joe Biggs, who's got a lot of active duty sources.
[25:08.200 --> 25:11.360]  We might as well just get Joe to come in here.
[25:11.360 --> 25:16.120]  Am I wrong in saying Obama has the lowest approval rating of any U.S. president since
[25:16.120 --> 25:21.040]  polling McGahn 100 years ago as reported by the military times?
[25:21.040 --> 25:26.560]  Because he's training the military to go after guns and engage in tyranny.
[25:26.560 --> 25:31.480]  And because he's opened up our borders, and because he is putting our military under NATO
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.880]  command and telling Congress they have no authority, and because he has engaged in
[25:36.880 --> 25:42.560]  treason and they know he is a socialist globalist selling this country out.
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.720]  I mean, look, you could say what you want about Petraeus, but Petraeus has been completely
[25:47.720 --> 25:50.400]  set up with this girlfriend.
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.680]  He was being watched.
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.080]  That's what the NSA is being used to do, is to target people.
[25:56.080 --> 26:00.600]  And Eric Holder has no business with his huge history of corruption.
[26:00.600 --> 26:06.680]  He's supposed to already be gone as AG, to now be going after and looking at inditing
[26:06.680 --> 26:08.160]  General Petraeus.
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.400]  In fact, I need to cover that some today.
[26:12.400 --> 26:19.400]  That's why he's so incredibly unpopular is that Obama really is at war with this country
[26:19.400 --> 26:28.240]  and the coup de grace, the final stroke, the creme de la creme of the reason the military
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.880]  is so unhappy, the scum of the scum.
[26:32.880 --> 26:40.280]  What makes them so upset is that they know ISIS is al-Qaeda and our government has been
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.240]  giving them aid and turning them loose to overthrow our allies, you name it, and kill
[26:44.240 --> 26:50.160]  Christians and non-radical Muslims en masse.
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.000]  Now the way the military times spins this is you're not supposed to ask active duty
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.600]  if they disagree with the president or not, because you get court-martialed for that.
[26:58.600 --> 27:07.040]  So 55% said they disapprove, but when they asked you approve, only 15%.
[27:07.040 --> 27:17.040]  And I'll guarantee you it's more like 5% approve and more like 90% disapprove or more because
[27:17.040 --> 27:24.920]  you're asking a group that doesn't like to not follow orders.
[27:24.920 --> 27:28.400]  And generally you don't want the military criticizing the president because they're
[27:28.400 --> 27:34.400]  active duty and that's their job, but when you have a traitor president who's disregarding
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.080]  the entire bill of rights and constitution, waging war against the sovereignty of the
[27:38.080 --> 27:43.280]  country, doubling the debt of the nation that took 240 years to develop, doubling it in
[27:43.280 --> 27:48.880]  seven years, bankrupting the country with Obamacare, doubling the number of people on
[27:48.880 --> 27:55.160]  food stamps, ordering the board of patrol to legalize the illegals by fiat and give them
[27:55.160 --> 28:01.280]  money to be put on Greyhound buses and brought into the country, then it is your duty to say
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.280]  no.
[28:02.280 --> 28:07.960]  If the president orders you to do national gun confiscation or something, it's a no-brainer.
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.960]  You don't follow that order.
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.960]  That is treason.
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.280]  If the president orders you to, say, arrest 10,000 American citizens, and they've done
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.120]  this before with Japanese who've been there three, four generations, it was a tragedy.
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.520]  But let's say they just randomly say, arrest this list of libertarians.
[28:24.520 --> 28:26.520]  They were behind a terror attack.
[28:26.520 --> 28:31.440]  You can bet we're not behind the terror attack, but you can also understand the military is
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.040]  not supposed to come grab us and disappear us.
[28:34.040 --> 28:39.760]  We're supposed to be indicted by a grand jury, federal or state, and then brought before
[28:39.760 --> 28:41.760]  the judge and we get a defense.
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.080]  You do not arrest people politically.
[28:46.080 --> 28:47.280]  Do you understand that?
[28:47.280 --> 28:56.040]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, jurisprudence, our way of life, Americana is an order.
[28:56.040 --> 29:02.040]  Only from 1776, you are ordered to follow the Declaration of Independence, Constitution,
[29:02.040 --> 29:03.040]  Bill of Rights.
[29:03.040 --> 29:06.200]  You are ordered by President George Washington.
[29:06.200 --> 29:11.840]  You are ordered by right through to Ronald Reagan.
[29:11.840 --> 29:13.720]  Your orders still stand.
[29:13.720 --> 29:17.040]  Do not violate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[29:17.040 --> 29:18.040]  Follow that oath.
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.560]  And I know you want to follow it, and you see that president crapping all over it from
[29:22.560 --> 29:27.760]  one end to the other, and you're upset, and that's why you don't like Obama, not about
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.200]  the red herring if you just don't like gay people.
[29:30.200 --> 29:32.560]  No, it's because you don't like a tyrant.
[29:32.560 --> 29:35.600]  We should start a new meme.
[29:35.600 --> 29:39.160]  Officers and enlisted should cover your faces, hold up the meme, like you did a few years
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.560]  ago, you won't fight for al-Qaeda in Syria, saying, we dislike Obama because he's a tyrant.
[29:44.560 --> 29:47.840]  That needs to be a new meme, so they're not speaking for you.
[29:47.840 --> 29:50.280]  We're going to give the number out and take your calls when we come back.
[29:50.280 --> 29:54.000]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 30:01.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.580 --> 30:02.580]  Another major health threat.
[30:02.580 --> 30:06.960]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[30:06.960 --> 30:07.960]  the water.
[30:07.960 --> 30:10.320]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[30:10.320 --> 30:16.000]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.320]  single day?
[30:17.320 --> 30:20.360]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[30:20.360 --> 30:23.280]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[30:23.280 --> 30:27.800]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once
[30:27.800 --> 30:28.800]  was.
[30:28.800 --> 30:34.160]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[30:34.160 --> 30:37.440]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[30:37.440 --> 30:40.560]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[30:40.560 --> 30:46.560]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently
[30:46.560 --> 30:48.280]  minded household.
[30:48.280 --> 30:51.080]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[31:01.360 --> 31:05.160]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape and the truth is it's hard

[31:16.520 --> 31:21.480]  particles, in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked.

[32:01.280 --> 32:04.960]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[32:04.960 --> 32:09.320]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[32:09.320 --> 32:11.320]  Can you put two and two together?
[32:11.320 --> 32:16.880]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[32:16.880 --> 32:18.920]  priced and fully legal.

[32:29.720 --> 32:34.400]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[32:39.520 --> 32:42.800]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[33:26.480 --> 33:31.080]  Alex Jones.
[33:31.080 --> 33:34.080]  I want freedom and I want more of it.
[33:34.080 --> 33:38.360]  And I want all the tyrants and insider groups that think my life belongs to them who want
[33:38.360 --> 33:42.480]  to tell me how to think and tell me how to talk and tell me what gods the worship to
[33:42.480 --> 33:45.720]  go jump in the lake.
[33:45.720 --> 33:50.320]  And I mean a lake of fire.
[33:50.320 --> 33:51.880]  Here's the type of news I have in front of me.
[33:51.880 --> 33:57.120]  I want to open the phones up for veterans or also active duty, especially we'll go to
[33:57.120 --> 33:59.040]  the head of the line.
[33:59.040 --> 34:00.640]  Why are you upset with Obama?
[34:00.640 --> 34:01.640]  Or maybe you love him.
[34:01.640 --> 34:06.440]  Maybe you're the 10, 15% that think everything's really great.
[34:06.440 --> 34:13.480]  But the big issue I'm going with here, my angle is the military is not upset overall
[34:13.480 --> 34:18.120]  with the red herring of gays in the military or women in frontline combat.
[34:18.120 --> 34:20.600]  That's just meant to demoralize and cause infighting.
[34:20.600 --> 34:26.880]  That is an issue but smaller compared to funding Al Qaeda and ISIS, opening the borders, training
[34:26.880 --> 34:32.160]  the military for domestic operations against the American people, which the ISIS attacks
[34:32.160 --> 34:36.320]  will be used to roll out, then it will be flipped onto the patriots.
[34:36.320 --> 34:37.360]  You've already seen that happen.
[34:37.360 --> 34:39.360]  I predicted that 15 years ago.
[34:39.360 --> 34:41.480]  You've now seen that happen to a certain extent.
[34:41.480 --> 34:44.480]  You will see the full rollout.
[34:44.480 --> 34:45.480]  The full rollout.
[34:45.480 --> 34:49.680]  In fact, it could be before Obama leaves office.
[34:49.680 --> 34:54.160]  This republic has never been in more peril.
[34:54.160 --> 35:00.360]  Speaking of Al Qaeda, ISIS releases, we're going to show some of this footage so viewer
[35:00.360 --> 35:04.760]  discretion is advised if you're watching us on the video feeds at infowars.com.
[35:04.760 --> 35:13.280]  ISIS releases new footage claiming to show a child executing two Russian spies.
[35:13.280 --> 35:18.600]  Yeah, there's no greater enemy of ISIS than Russia who's been battling them in Syria.
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.560]  Not lionizing Russia, just there battling Al Qaeda and ISIS and we're giving them weapons
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.640]  and support so their people can then come attack us as well.
[35:30.640 --> 35:37.720]  Back of evidence of injury shown in the video suggests the execution may be staged and we
[35:37.720 --> 35:39.200]  see this over and over again.
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.920]  People just don't think this stuff's real and it's certainly true that Al Qaeda.
[35:44.920 --> 35:46.560]  Notice that symbol looks like the Al Qaeda symbol.
[35:46.560 --> 35:53.360]  It's because it is the Al Qaeda symbol and the footage does kind of look fake to me.
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.920]  Footages up on infowars.com.
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.920]  The footage shows a boy, looks like he's about 11, and an ISIS soldier standing behind two
[36:02.920 --> 36:08.320]  kneeling spies who do look Russian after which the boy allegedly shoots the great clad men
[36:08.320 --> 36:09.920]  in the back of their heads.
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.560]  However, lack of visible injuries on the men and evidence of blood after the killing suggests
[36:14.560 --> 36:17.680]  the executions may be staged for the cameras.
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.160]  Let's get Joe Beggs to do a special report on this for the nightly news, get his expert
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.680]  take on that.
[36:24.680 --> 36:27.440]  So they've released the footage claiming to show this, so what do you think?
[36:27.440 --> 36:32.720]  You can call us about that as well, 800-259-9231.
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.360]  Speaking of Russia, it's now admitted in the mainstream news, even in Bloomberg today,
[36:37.360 --> 36:43.480]  that dropping oil prices by the OPEC cartel is meant to bankrupt Russia and bankrupt U.S.
[36:43.480 --> 36:45.640]  small-time oil producers.
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.080]  So there you go, the globalists are attacking anybody who wants to independently deploy oil
[36:50.080 --> 36:51.760]  and gas.
[36:51.760 --> 36:57.120]  Not lionizing small oil companies, a lot of them do bad fracking and things, still it
[36:57.120 --> 36:58.120]  doesn't matter.
[36:58.120 --> 37:04.480]  Saudi Arabia running OPEC is calling the shots, Obama's doing what they say, and they are
[37:04.480 --> 37:10.800]  cutting oil prices to bankrupt exploration by Syria, by Israel, by Central and South
[37:10.800 --> 37:17.800]  American countries, by Caribbean countries, by California, by Oklahoma, by Arkansas, by
[37:17.800 --> 37:26.520]  Texas, by South and North Dakota, by Illinois, Canada, Russia, Poland, Ukraine.
[37:26.520 --> 37:32.600]  This is going to kill oil and gas production all over the world, because they're lowering
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.640]  it so artificially low.
[37:34.640 --> 37:39.280]  It was doubly high, should have been cut, now they're just going to the other extreme,
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.640]  and when they're done in a few years, oh, $10 a gallon if they have their way, so just
[37:44.640 --> 37:45.640]  get ready.
[37:45.640 --> 37:50.280]  If you enjoy bankrupting Russia now, there's this primitive idea out there that bankrupting
[37:50.280 --> 37:54.120]  some country helps us, no it doesn't.
[37:54.120 --> 38:01.880]  We need partners to trade with and to be in business with and in things like other forms
[38:01.880 --> 38:10.280]  of entertainment commerce and travel people that are engaged in tourism, and all of that
[38:10.280 --> 38:16.560]  is drying up under globalism, which promised this cornucopia of commerce, but globalism
[38:16.560 --> 38:21.320]  is designed to end commerce in the general public's hands, or in free state's hands,
[38:21.320 --> 38:23.840]  and to consolidate it.
[38:23.840 --> 38:30.800]  Russia to boost military capabilities and Crimea, and in the Arctic, we're in a new
[38:30.800 --> 38:39.680]  Cold War, says RT, so especially the mouth of Soran, the mouth of Russia, saying that
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.280]  we are now in a new Cold War.
[38:44.280 --> 38:49.160]  Now the U.S. vows to cut off North Korea from the international financial system, that's
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.360]  one criminal group, vowing to cut off another criminal group, that's just some of the news
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.840]  we've got on that front, but I want to talk to active duty military or vets who have
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.440]  friends and family that are active duty, am I wrong in saying that it's a red herring?
[39:03.440 --> 39:07.600]  They don't want it to be in the news that the military knows Obama's a traitor who's
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.400]  training for gun confiscation and treason, and who's turned our military over to U.N.
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.760]  NATO control, and who has become a dictator for all intents and purposes.
[39:16.760 --> 39:22.560]  That's why the military is upset in the new polls out with military times, showing only
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.200]  15% approve of L. Hefe.
[39:26.200 --> 39:35.640]  Let's go to Steve, who is former Army and retired Border Patrol customs agent to give
[39:35.640 --> 39:39.680]  us his take, because I have a lot of people that are vets, Bryant's a vet, Howard's a
[39:39.680 --> 39:47.480]  vet, Matt's a vet, sometimes I'll get 10, 15 calls in a row that are active duty without
[39:47.480 --> 39:52.480]  asking for it, and then when I ask for active duty, I can't get it, so it's fine.
[39:52.480 --> 40:01.520]  You don't have to be active duty to call in, but that's who got pulled here.
[40:01.520 --> 40:04.200]  Vets are good because they're still in that community, I just want to get your take on
[40:04.200 --> 40:11.840]  this, but I'd really like to hear from active duty if you can get in on the line, 800-259-9231.
[40:11.840 --> 40:13.880]  Let's go ahead and go to Steve and Georgia.
[40:13.880 --> 40:14.880]  What's your take on this?
[40:14.880 --> 40:15.880]  Am I wrong?
[40:15.880 --> 40:24.880]  Hey Alex, first time caller here from North Georgia, retired U.S. Customs Agent and former
[40:24.880 --> 40:25.880]  Army.
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.400]  I love the show.
[40:30.400 --> 40:41.840]  Obama, I saw your program with the Egyptian former military, former intelligent person
[40:41.840 --> 40:49.840]  in 1993 bombing, and for the end of that interview was something that he touched on that was
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.320]  very crucial in my opinion.
[40:52.320 --> 40:58.800]  I think that the U.S. intelligence people and people in Congress should go ahead and
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.840]  investigate Obama for his connections with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[41:03.840 --> 41:10.880]  I mean, it's all over in black and white what he's done to support that organization.
[41:10.880 --> 41:17.360]  Oh yeah, they even had CNN and MSNBC three years ago when they turned that country over
[41:17.360 --> 41:27.360]  to him, cheering the Muslim Brotherhood on as they threw basically liberal, or that is
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.880]  not Orthodox Muslims off of buildings and crucified Christians.
[41:32.880 --> 41:36.800]  I mean, that's how sick the so-called left is.
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.280]  These people aren't the left, they're just crazy nuts.
[41:40.280 --> 41:52.320]  I agree, I agree, and it's my opinion that some way Obama is part of the Muslim, there's
[41:52.320 --> 41:59.560]  got to be a reason that he supports that group, and I wish you'd dig into it a little bit
[41:59.560 --> 42:00.560]  more.
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.240]  Now, I hear you, WorldNet Daily has been on the cutting edge of that.
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.600]  It's documented, it's come out in the Egyptian court that Obama, through his cousins and
[42:09.600 --> 42:16.600]  half-brother, through Kenya has been financing a pan-African Muslim takeover, radical Muslim
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.240]  takeover, and is directly fencing money in by the millions, tens of millions a month
[42:22.240 --> 42:28.600]  into Egypt, because Kenya is right below Egypt, to try to destabilize the entire region.
[42:28.600 --> 42:32.640]  It's so bold, it's beyond a Tom Clancy novel.
[42:32.640 --> 42:40.360]  Think about it, our president on the side is trying to put an extremist caliphate in
[42:40.360 --> 42:42.200]  to areas of Africa and the Middle East.
[42:42.200 --> 42:44.480]  I mean, that is bold.
[42:44.480 --> 42:50.400]  He literally destabilized and ordered the army of Egypt to arrest Haas-e-Mubarak and
[42:50.400 --> 42:53.160]  then to let the Muslim Brotherhood takeover.
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.960]  Google helped organize the overthrow of the government with Facebook.
[42:56.960 --> 42:59.680]  I mean, they brag about all this.
[42:59.680 --> 43:08.120]  To then engage in a reign of terror against Christians, I mean, these people are radical,
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.280]  radical, dangerous revolutionaries.
[43:10.280 --> 43:11.680]  God bless you.
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.080]  I can't believe I'm even saying all this on air.
[43:15.080 --> 43:22.360]  I'm supposedly the conspiracy theorist, and I cannot believe this is in mainstream Egyptian
[43:22.360 --> 43:28.480]  newspapers, this has come out in court, and it's been confirmed that Obama is directly
[43:28.480 --> 43:35.720]  connected to the people that attacked the shopping mall in Kenya.
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.240]  I mean, I remember when Odinga didn't win, and on Obama's letterhead, we've got to get
[43:40.240 --> 43:44.200]  Dr. Corsi on as soon as possible to hold special on this, because he has copies of the letters.
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.160]  He went to Kenya, but he got copies of the senator's letters.
[43:48.160 --> 43:53.080]  When Obama was senator, advising Odinga on how to stir up riots when he didn't get elected
[43:53.080 --> 43:57.800]  president of Kenya to then make him a new position, they created a prime ministership
[43:57.800 --> 44:00.920]  just for the Muslims.
[44:00.920 --> 44:04.800]  They're trying to repeat what's happened in Sudan, breaking the country into, I mean,
[44:04.800 --> 44:06.280]  Obama is not a liberal.
[44:06.280 --> 44:08.880]  He's a hardcore conqueror.
[44:08.880 --> 44:17.600]  He's a hardcore mafia gang boss who's taken over, and now they're ready to prosecute
[44:17.600 --> 44:22.840]  Petraeus for having a girlfriend while they ship guns into Mexico to destabilize the whole
[44:22.840 --> 44:23.840]  Southwest.
[44:23.840 --> 44:29.880]  I mean, do you understand how bold these people are?
[44:29.880 --> 44:32.120]  It is not fun to go up against them.
[44:32.120 --> 44:36.560]  I mean, look, I don't want to get killed or put in a federal prison for no reason, but
[44:36.560 --> 44:39.320]  somebody's got to stand up against these people.
[44:39.320 --> 44:46.080]  I mean, they really are so criminal that I can't even believe it.
[44:46.080 --> 44:49.200]  I mean, the elite are in control of America.
[44:49.200 --> 44:50.920]  The elite are in control of the nuclear weapons.
[44:50.920 --> 44:53.240]  The elite are in control of the Federal Reserve.
[44:53.240 --> 44:54.240]  They're in control.
[44:54.240 --> 44:56.440]  Why do they want to overthrow everything?
[44:56.440 --> 44:58.600]  Why do they want to screw everything up?
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.520]  They're deviant, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:01.520 --> 45:06.920]  They're in control, they live in the $50 million penthouses.
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.680]  They fly in the $75 million private jets.
[45:10.680 --> 45:13.280]  They have all the mistresses they could ever want.
[45:13.280 --> 45:19.800]  They run the show, and the globalists would put Obama in to stir up a radical Muslim revolution
[45:19.800 --> 45:24.240]  to kill every Muslim that isn't going along with it and kill every Christian, every Jew,
[45:24.240 --> 45:29.160]  every agnostic, destroy free speech, and I watched Fox and CNN, and they've got Alan
[45:29.160 --> 45:33.480]  Combs and others on there saying, there's no such thing as radical Islam, and you shouldn't
[45:33.480 --> 45:37.920]  be able to criticize it, and now people are following the orders and not saying radical
[45:37.920 --> 45:38.920]  Islam.
[45:38.920 --> 45:41.960]  It's like you couldn't say illegal immigrant, then you couldn't say immigrant.
[45:41.960 --> 45:44.320]  Now you've got to call them migrants.
[45:44.320 --> 45:48.160]  We just sit here and are told how to talk and told how to live.
[45:48.160 --> 45:49.160]  It's a sick joke.
[45:49.160 --> 45:51.400]  I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[45:51.400 --> 45:54.800]  Brian in Florida, you're a vet.
[45:54.800 --> 45:59.680]  What is your take on why people are so upset with Obama and the military?
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.680]  I retired from the Army a year and a half ago.
[46:03.680 --> 46:10.720]  My wife's still in, so I have to parse my comments here, but when all this don't ask,
[46:10.720 --> 46:16.080]  don't tell, no one really cared, honestly, and when they said, okay, you can be gained
[46:16.080 --> 46:19.000]  in the military, everyone's like, shrug your shoulders, pay whatever.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.720]  That's just the way it is.
[46:20.720 --> 46:23.040]  That's not really it.
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.560]  The big thing is, as Obama is the constant, he says he's going to get out of Iraq here
[46:27.560 --> 46:28.560]  in Afghanistan.
[46:28.560 --> 46:36.200]  Okay, we really are now, and so the problem is that a lot of my friends who went to Afghanistan
[46:36.200 --> 46:42.320]  or Iraq, they're kind of irritated that the fact that we just left, we pretty much started
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.080]  a house fire and left, and then we're a little surprised that the house fire is still going
[46:48.080 --> 46:49.080]  on.
[46:49.080 --> 46:53.600]  I mean, yeah, we shouldn't have been over there, granted, but the problem is that we
[46:53.600 --> 46:58.880]  should have, I don't know, unscrewed, I guess, our problem, but we didn't do it.
[46:58.880 --> 46:59.880]  Well, that's it.
[46:59.880 --> 47:03.520]  The frustration is you were sent in to destabilize the area, not bring peace, and the military
[47:03.520 --> 47:07.720]  now knows that, and you're being put into more and more deployments, less and less
[47:07.720 --> 47:08.720]  pay.
[47:08.720 --> 47:12.200]  I mean, is that not another big part of the morale problem?
[47:12.200 --> 47:18.760]  Yeah, honestly, it's the paperwork, if you will, the red tape.
[47:18.760 --> 47:24.680]  If you want anything done, it's a disaster.
[47:24.680 --> 47:27.640]  For instance, you've got a pay problem.
[47:27.640 --> 47:31.040]  It takes pretty much half the day to take care of it.
[47:31.040 --> 47:37.520]  Let's say the army does a poll and the suicide rate goes up 10%, then there's classes all
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.880]  week about how not to kill yourself.
[47:41.880 --> 47:49.160]  You do more paperwork and more stuff to, I guess, if you will, to satisfy the TPS reports,
[47:49.160 --> 47:51.360]  then you know, gain from that.
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.640]  Sure, and that's all designed to sabotage the military ahead of the conversion to pure
[47:55.640 --> 47:57.160]  autonomous robots.
[47:57.160 --> 48:00.720]  And by the way, that's official, so I just hope the military knows this is all sabotage
[48:00.720 --> 48:01.720]  on purpose.
[48:01.720 --> 48:03.220]  God bless you.
[48:03.220 --> 48:08.560]  Because again, just as they use our military to enforce the empire, they hate you.
[48:08.560 --> 48:11.000]  The globalists hate you because you have courage.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.280]  They hate humanity being strong, and they hate the male, they hate the role model, they
[48:16.280 --> 48:24.180]  hate the warrior, because the globalists are the rat, scum, slimebag spiders of the universe.
[48:24.180 --> 48:25.400]  And so they fear you.
[48:25.400 --> 48:31.960]  They want armies of robots and drones that will carry out their bidding to basically enforce
[48:31.960 --> 48:36.440]  a global government, enforce forced inoculation and population reduction.
[48:36.440 --> 48:38.320]  That's the end game.
[48:38.320 --> 48:41.560]  Let's go ahead and go to Howard in Pennsylvania.
[48:41.560 --> 48:43.680]  You're an Air Force vet.
[48:43.680 --> 48:48.440]  The military I talked to are upset with Obama over his domestic secret operations, preparations
[48:48.440 --> 48:54.560]  for martial law, putting our military under U.N. NATO command, opening the borders, things
[48:54.560 --> 48:56.560]  like that.
[48:56.560 --> 48:59.200]  Why do you think the military is so upset with Obama?
[48:59.200 --> 49:05.600]  Well, I think mostly they're intelligent enough to realize that they're, it's obvious
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.640]  he's leaving a fifth column into this country.
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.720]  And we're all going to be in big trouble because who do you shoot at?
[49:14.720 --> 49:17.600]  Well, that's right.
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.720]  He's infiltrating the government with just all sorts of communists, socialists, radical
[49:21.720 --> 49:25.040]  Islamists who are then going to stage attacks and blame it on us.
[49:25.040 --> 49:26.760]  I mean, you just know it.
[49:26.760 --> 49:28.440]  They've been caught doing that before.
[49:28.440 --> 49:35.600]  Well, yeah, well, the thing with me is, you know, I'm a Vietnam veteran and I was a previous,
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.080]  some things that most people aren't aware of, and one of the things that made me quit
[49:40.080 --> 49:45.200]  was when I found out that the French and Canadians were in high-flying harbor, and that's why
[49:45.200 --> 49:46.200]  I never got mine.
[49:46.200 --> 49:49.920]  I mean, the way you fly your wars, you cut off the enemy's fly line.
[49:49.920 --> 49:50.920]  We never did that.
[49:50.920 --> 49:51.920]  It's just big business.
[49:51.920 --> 49:52.920]  That's right.
[49:52.920 --> 49:59.680]  The war was a big, bottomless, no-bid contract meat grinder to feed you into it, never meaning
[49:59.680 --> 50:01.160]  to defeat the North.
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.800]  No, there was no intention of ever doing it.
[50:04.800 --> 50:08.000]  That's exactly what's still going on today.
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.320]  And the thing is, the soldier is in a position where it takes a supreme act of bravery in
[50:14.320 --> 50:17.080]  order to say, no, I quit.
[50:17.080 --> 50:18.080]  You're crazy.
[50:18.080 --> 50:19.080]  Well, that's right.
[50:19.080 --> 50:22.880]  And that's what comes down to the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war in Vietnam,
[50:22.880 --> 50:24.720]  this al-Qaeda thing.
[50:24.720 --> 50:29.400]  Al-Qaeda was beaten, so they give them a new base, and now they're worse than ever in
[50:29.400 --> 50:30.400]  Colomysus.
[50:30.400 --> 50:31.400]  I mean, it's so clear what they've done.
[50:31.400 --> 50:37.480]  Oh, yeah, that's obvious, but the American people, unfortunately, are not going to, as
[50:37.480 --> 50:40.560]  long as there's bread and circuses, they're not going to wake up to what's going on until
[50:40.560 --> 50:42.080]  somebody's knocking on their door.
[50:42.080 --> 50:47.200]  And that's why they hate the military, because they know the military knows the names and
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.360]  the groups when the general public doesn't know.
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.480]  The system fears informed men and women.
[50:53.480 --> 50:56.200]  The military is informed.
[50:56.200 --> 50:58.440]  That's why they're the enemy of the globalist.
[50:58.440 --> 50:59.520]  We'll be back.

[54:24.840 --> 54:39.480]  I'm going to go to your calls, Matt and Rambo, Francis, Toby, Steve, everybody.
[54:39.480 --> 54:43.640]  We've got an active duty Marine.
[54:43.640 --> 54:46.680]  Orders not to talk about Obama.
[54:46.680 --> 54:48.800]  I'm going to get his take first here in just a moment.
[54:48.800 --> 54:51.920]  We're going to go to Steve in Texas, active duty Marine.
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.760]  Here's a Military Times report out that did a poll showing that only 15% approve of the
[54:57.760 --> 54:58.760]  President.
[54:58.760 --> 55:04.160]  Well, look, when the President is engaged in tyranny, it's okay to speak out against
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.160]  him.
[55:05.160 --> 55:08.960]  I mean, when he told Fort Hood soldiers through a memo two years ago, you will not be an evangelical
[55:08.960 --> 55:13.640]  and you will not join the Tea Party or will court-martial you, Fox News asked, is that
[55:13.640 --> 55:16.480]  okay?
[55:16.480 --> 55:17.480]  Is that okay?
[55:17.480 --> 55:24.960]  I mean, that is a crazy, crazy, crazy statement.
[55:24.960 --> 55:30.640]  No, it's not okay to tell troops what religion they can be or that they could be court-martialed.
[55:30.640 --> 55:32.360]  I mean, that actually happened.
[55:32.360 --> 55:36.960]  That's like the Soviet Union on steroids.
[55:36.960 --> 55:39.960]  So at a certain point, you've got to say no.
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.720]  And the military is awake because they're getting all this training.
[55:43.720 --> 55:49.000]  In fact, let's just go to Steve right now, active duty Marine.
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.520]  Why do you think the military is so upset with Obama?
[55:51.520 --> 55:58.080]  Over the past two, two and a half years in Afghanistan, the CIA has been directing a
[55:58.080 --> 56:06.520]  lot of special operators and in my case, the recon battalions to clean up loose ends in
[56:06.520 --> 56:07.520]  Afghanistan.
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.160]  Those people that had knowledge of the drug trade of what the CIA was doing.
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.800]  And there were several, and when I say high-ranking, I mean, you know, the Marine Corps high-ranking
[56:16.800 --> 56:20.720]  officers are usually colonels because we're not as large as the Army.
[56:20.720 --> 56:26.840]  There were three general court-martials in the last year of a Lieutenant Colonel, Italian
[56:26.840 --> 56:33.760]  commander, and a couple of different company commanders, captains, majors, etc., for failing
[56:33.760 --> 56:39.520]  to follow the orders to go into the villages and shwak these guys that were working with
[56:39.520 --> 56:40.520]  the CIA.
[56:40.520 --> 56:47.320]  The charges on the Colonel were reduced to, kind of, becoming an officer and fair to
[56:47.320 --> 56:53.360]  obey a direct order, but he was charged with mutiny, and it's been quiet because the people
[56:53.360 --> 56:57.120]  I know in the States, when I called, I'd ask them, hey, if you guys heard anything about
[56:57.120 --> 57:01.360]  the general court-martials going on at Hanson, Camp Hanson in Okinawa is the headquarters
[57:01.360 --> 57:03.080]  of the Third Marine Division.
[57:03.080 --> 57:10.480]  So you've got a lot of that, and so Third Division, I rotated back about six weeks ago,
[57:10.480 --> 57:16.400]  and there was a division order in Third Division, not to have any political conversation in
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.480]  work areas having anything to do with the Commander-in-Chief, period.
[57:20.480 --> 57:25.080]  So just don't have a talk, period, just do what the Fuhrer says.
[57:25.080 --> 57:30.680]  Do not speak the President's name, and he's not referred to as Barack Obama, President
[57:30.680 --> 57:39.480]  Obama, in all the memos coming down from Third Mark, there are no political conversation
[57:39.480 --> 57:41.800]  involving the Commander-in-Chief.
[57:41.800 --> 57:43.480]  So that is beyond Orwellian.
[57:43.480 --> 57:46.480]  You are not even to say his name, he's so God-like.
[57:46.480 --> 57:51.040]  Well, the reason that in the memos that they use Commander-in-Chief is to emphasize that
[57:51.040 --> 57:57.480]  he's in our chain of command, and so therefore, yeah, if you violate that memo coming down
[57:57.480 --> 58:04.000]  from a division, then the way they can bring you up on charges, because it's the double-speak
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.040]  referring to him as a Commander-in-Chief instead of as the President.
[58:07.040 --> 58:08.040]  Sure, I understand.
[58:08.040 --> 58:09.040]  So this is some heavy info.
[58:09.040 --> 58:10.920]  We've got to go to break, but hold over if you can.
[58:10.920 --> 58:14.560]  I want to finish up with you ahead of Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us.
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.560]  You're saying, and this is the intel I've got, it's the same thing, that the drug dealing,
[58:19.560 --> 58:24.120]  the DEA, all the stuff going on, the military speaking out, they're not following orders
[58:24.120 --> 58:29.680]  to work with terrorist groups, because Obama's in a major alliance with them now, and so they're
[58:29.680 --> 58:33.560]  court-martialing and firing officers at a record rate, and you're saying that's why
[58:33.560 --> 58:35.560]  Morale's so low?
[58:35.560 --> 58:37.640]  Absolutely, but there's more.
[58:37.640 --> 58:38.640]  There's more.
[58:38.640 --> 58:39.640]  There's more together.
[58:39.640 --> 58:40.640]  I want to hear the more.
[58:40.640 --> 58:46.160]  Folks, the military knows we have an imposter in the White House.

[59:03.200 --> 59:08.600]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowars Life Line, because they
[59:08.600 --> 59:13.760]  are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they

[59:53.320 --> 01:00:06.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:31.320]  The reason I tend to get a bit hysterical on air is that I live this stuff.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:39.120]  I eat, drink, and sleep it, and the criminal organizations running our government and others
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.800]  are so mischievous, so evil, so bad, I mean everything they do is to destabilize and
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.800]  bring down society.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.960]  It's not like I'm some perfect goody-two-shoes that, you know, it just hates everybody in
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.200]  government or corporations.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.200]  It's that as a society we become so corrupt and more and more of our economy is based
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.640]  on corruption, and now it sees anything that's not corrupt as a threat and is seeking to
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:12.560]  fully convert the military, the FBI, the Justice Department, and these corporate boards to
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.160]  members of the conspiracy.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.920]  And when you learn they're a bunch of anti-human, really nasty people, because who else would
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.280]  do stuff like this but really nasty people?
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.400]  And now it's been running things so long that really bad people have gotten in.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.160]  There's been competition amongst evil.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:35.660]  And so the most evil, the most evil are now getting in, and until you flip your mind around
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:41.440]  from their perspective and look through their eyes, you won't be able to grasp it.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.560]  But once you sit in their seat and actually read what they write and what they stand for,
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.120]  God help us.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.240]  God help us.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.200]  They want to break this country.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.560]  They want to re-educate us, they want to hurt us.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.520]  We are in grave danger.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520]  Grave danger.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.920]  Steve, you've got the floor and then we're going to get to Matt and everybody else that's
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.920]  holding.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:13.120]  Colonel Roberts is coming up, I used to get Colonel Roberts on, Craig Roberts, Dr. Paul
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.920]  Craig Roberts is coming up, but I was thinking the other day I want to get Paul Craig Roberts
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.960]  on, but I also want to get Colonel Roberts on because he'd have a lot to say about this,
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.440]  a great patriot who exposed Oklahoma City as an inside job.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.880]  But let's go back to Steve, the active duty Marine that just rotated back.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.440]  You've got about three minutes.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.520]  Finish up why you think Obama has a 15% approval rating with the U.S. military.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:42.880]  Well Alex, with regard to seal and recon Marines coming back out of Afghanistan through
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:50.880]  Okinawa, you have a lot of the enlisted operators being charged with mutiny and other crimes
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.520]  that carry the death sentence.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:59.680]  Now what I'd like for you to do if possible is get in touch with your contacts in Navy
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.560]  special operations, if you've got any in the Marine Corps.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:11.000]  The campaigns of Brig is full of seals, recon Marines that have these charges of mutiny
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.040]  on them that they've been sitting in there six, seven, eight months now and what that
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:22.640]  does when you're sitting in the Brig that long, they're hoping that these operators
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.920]  are going to kill themselves.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.680]  That way they can wash their hands, there's no loose ends and they don't have to do what
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.400]  they did to Chris Kyle.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.760]  I would really like you to look into this because before I came back there were 15 recon
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:42.440]  Marines and seven seals that I personally knew that were good men because they either
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:49.640]  did not fully cooperate or zealously cooperate and clean up the loose ends with the drug
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.880]  connections for the CIA in Afghanistan are sitting in the campaigns in Brig right now
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.640]  waiting to go on trial for their lives.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.920]  That's right and sir I am aware of this, I've interviewed Navy SEALs families on air.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.480]  I have first broke the fact that the families believed and the SEALs believed that helicopter
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.040]  was blown up to get rid of the evidence.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.400]  We know Chris Kyle was executed and they had a Pat C in that, a drugged up Pat C because
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.520]  he wasn't going to go along with what he'd been ordered to do in the book just like
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.160]  they killed Pat Tillman when he was writing letters to him and I've talked to his brother
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.600]  off air and of course it came out later that indeed they did kill him.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.000]  It's so scary but I am aware of some of what you're saying and everybody's so scared right
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.680]  now because even if you do what they say they're kicking you out or dishonorably discharging
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.640]  you to discredit you and it shows the total dishonor of this system.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:54.760]  There is a purge, a soft purge, a night of the long knives going on in special operations
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]  right now.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:01.000]  There's a war on the military right now, I mean that's what Obama's purging folks.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.240]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges, unlock the energy it takes to
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:13.280]  defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality, specifically designed

[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.600]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.960]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.960]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:46.560]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.640]  priced and fully legal, but for how long?

[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.880]  core products.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.480]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.160]  And the truth is, it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.920]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.640]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I've found that super high quality nutraceuticals,
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.000]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.920]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.000]  I increase stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.600]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the m4slife resolution pack, combining three

[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.280]  Marine, force recon operator who's rotated back about all the Navy SEALs and Marines
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.440]  and you name it, in the brigs.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:34.560]  They're even targeting the Army more in a purge of top officers.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.080]  We've confirmed from high-level sources, I'm talking retired three-star generals, who've
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.240]  been recently retired, that there is a purge.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.960]  We've been telling you that for three years.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.120]  It's now been in mainstream news and an unprecedented number of generals and other officers right
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.040]  on the non-commissioned are being kicked out, persecuted, Obama and the neocons working
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.200]  together are consolidating power in government.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.880]  That's why the Republicans dare not challenge Boehner.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.840]  He's come out now and attacked Obama today as political cover for not repealing Obamacare.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.280]  We're going to be playing that video after Paul Craig Roberts leaves us.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.840]  I wanted to get him on about the economy.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.520]  He's got a new article out right now about the Charlie Hebdo situation.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.240]  We'll get his take on that as well.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:20.240]  Francis is active duty state guard lieutenant, and I wanted to get his take on this military
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.920]  times poll with Obama with a 15% approval rating.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.000]  The callers, the active duty and veterans have agreed, nobody's talking about gays in
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  the military.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  That's a red herring.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.560]  They don't like Obama because he is engaging in treason.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:42.840]  Open borders, continuing the wars, persecuting the military and backing ISIS in Syria.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.440]  That's why they're upset.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.640]  Now, that's what the callers have said.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.200]  I'm going to go to other callers after we talk to Roberts, but I want to get to Francis
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.840]  because he's active duty while Dr. Roberts waits, and I want to get his take on it.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:00.040]  Francis, what is your take on what's happening, and do you have any intel on persecution inside
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.320]  the military by the Justice Department that's now going after Petraeus?
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.120]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120]  Thank you.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.560]  Alex, my name's Francis Merring.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.000]  You can check out my veracity off the air, if you like, but I am in the FEMA region
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.920]  for active duty state guards.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.000]  I don't know anyone who's for Obama in the military or in state guards.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.280]  I don't know of any persecution either per se, but I'm sure there is plenty.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:34.000]  But my point is, the core of our problem is, I was also on Ron Paul's campaign staff
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.800]  in 08 and in 12, and I just want to say bottom line, as I witnessed this personally, I think
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.200]  a lot of people did too, that Dr. Ron Paul is politically pure and everything as good
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:52.600]  as he is, and Rand, they do not have the stones to resist this, to effectively resist.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.120]  Ron and Rand Paul do not have the stones that his followers have, and I'm just telling
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120]  that.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  I witnessed that.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.120]  I'm sorry to say that.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.680]  Ron Paul stood down.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.880]  Tom Petty and Heartbreakers, who went back down, was our theme song in our office, and
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:14.840]  Ron Paul back down, notwithstanding his lousy grandson-in-law and his ineffective official
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  campaign.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.400]  Well, I don't want to get into all that.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  I'm aware of some of it.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.400]  Ron Paul was on yesterday.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.400]  He does his best job he can.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.400]  Specifically, why is the military upset with Obama?
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:32.520]  Well, Obama is an absolute tyrant, and he's out to destroy America.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:39.800]  He is America's number one enemy, although a puppet, he's the number one visible enemy.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:45.200]  He's got guys behind him that are bigger enemies, but he needs to be resisted, and we need to
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:51.520]  have the stones go balls to the wall to resist him in the infor war, and hopefully not the
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520]  active war.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]  Now, I hear you.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]  God bless you.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.520]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:03.040]  Again, the military, 15% approval rating for Obama, lowest ever, that's a good sign.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.880]  The military two years ago, this is the key to success, said no to attacking Syria, and
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.120]  thousands of officers held up signs saying, I will not fight in Syria for al-Qaeda.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.280]  So they changed the name to ISIS.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:18.520]  Now, ISIS-connected groups have attacked Europe, if you believe the official story, and that's
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:25.440]  being used to try to pass SISPA again, has been reintroduced bipartisanly, infowars.com.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.680]  Joining us is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former main editor of the Wall Street Journal, father
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:37.600]  of Reaganomics, best-selling author, and of course worked for Ronald Reagan, and he's
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.360]  here to break down the economy, his take on the Charlie Hebdo situation, his take on many
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:48.160]  more analysts believe 2015 is the year of the next global financial crisis.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.680]  We'll hit all those points with him in the next 20 minutes.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.800]  Dr. Roberts, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.000]  Sure, glad to be with you, Alex.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.360]  Well, you got the floor.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.360]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.520]  Well, that's up to you.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.440]  We can talk about the retail sales report that came out today.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:16.000]  You know, after being told that we had 5% real GDP growth in the third quarter, we was at
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.760]  the fourth quarter.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:27.760]  We learned that retail, Christmas retail sales actually declined, and it not just declined
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.320]  in the expected amount of sales, but an absolute decline.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:39.120]  So clearly there's no economy, it's been obvious to any real economists for years that there's
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:45.800]  no economy because there's no growth in consumer incomes, not in real consumer incomes, there's
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.400]  no growth, and there's no growth in consumer credit except for student loans.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:58.320]  So there's no money to fuel an increase in demand, and since the economy is largely based
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.800]  on consumer demand, there's been no way to have a recovery or any kind of the growth
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.560]  claims that the government periodically issues.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:13.000]  So clearly the economy is in bad shape, and they're having more and more trouble hiding
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.720]  that fact.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:22.080]  So we are also watching a continuing drop in the oil price.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:29.400]  Now just try to imagine all of the trillions of dollars of oil-based derivatives.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:35.720]  When these prices come down so much, there has to be a lot of debt related to these derivatives
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.000]  that simply can't be served.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:49.360]  And so yes, we're probably in line for another breakout of the financial crisis.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.040]  How long can the QE go, I mean how long can they keep just printing dollars by the trillions
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.720]  or issuing the digital money?
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.720]  As long as they can keep the Japanese central bank and the European central bank doing the
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.220]  same thing.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:12.760]  As long as the Japanese and the Europeans are printing in euros, those currencies grow
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:18.240]  along with the dollar, and so there's no relative change in the exchange values.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.280]  So the manipulation that Washington is able to achieve is international, and they can
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:30.680]  support the dollar through their basal states in Japan and Europe.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.160]  So how long does that continue?
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:39.000]  I think it can continue until a large part of the world simply moves away from the dollar
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.720]  payment system and stops using dollars the way the Russians and the Chinese are beginning
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.060]  to do.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:53.800]  So that would mean a very large drop in the demand for dollars as its role in financing
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:00.360]  the international payment system diminishes, and that's when I think they would lose control.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.880]  What do you make of China and Russia announcing they're going to launch a new credit rating
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:11.440]  agency in 2015 because obviously the other ratings agencies are being used politically
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.480]  to undermine China and Russia?
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.200]  Yes, I think that's just a response.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:23.400]  What China and Russia need more than a new credit rating agency is simply to withdraw
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.440]  from the Western payment system.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.960]  The two countries have economies that are very complementary, and therefore they can
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:40.600]  self-finance, and so while they need a rating system, in my opinion, it's reckless for the
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:49.880]  Russians to rely on Western capital or Western financial markets because they are a mechanism
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.040]  of Washington's imperialism.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:00.520]  And so when Russia relies on Western payment systems, it in effect is putting itself under
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:06.640]  Washington's thumb, and if the Russians did not participate in this system, they would
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.400]  not be facing sanctions because they would be independent of the system.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.320]  Sure, but that's why the West doesn't respect Russia is because it's so infiltrated by the
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:23.960]  same finance systems that we are, and globally these corporates, these crony capitalists are
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:29.120]  above the law, but they're not above the natural laws of man, and there's got to be a breaking
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.560]  point when the military has a 15% approval rating, when the public in Gallup says they
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.760]  don't trust the government at a record level, when we're really in a recession, depression,
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:43.560]  and they tell us everything's great, when reality begins to set in, there's got to be
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.960]  some point where the emperor's new clothes phenomenon becomes a reality.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:57.560]  Yes, I think the grand manipulations could be coming to an end this year.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:04.240]  We have not only the manipulation of the economy and people's perception of the economy, but
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:12.400]  also we have the manipulation of foreign policy and people's perceptions of the outside world.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.280]  And I think that the government's manipulations have reached the point that they're just now
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:24.680]  too extreme, and so they may lose that their control over people's minds.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:30.560]  This grand manipulation will be tested in 2015.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.760]  I want to shift gears now, you have a new article out today just titled Charlie Hebdo,
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.000]  the hypocrisy of the EU that since there's so much speech, now acting like there's so
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.880]  free speech standing up for this magazine, which I stand up for their free speech, but
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:50.600]  at the same time, hundreds of thousands have been killed in Syria after Westerback rebels
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.600]  did it.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.400]  They're connected to this group.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.760]  What about mourning for all the Syrians or Libyans the West has killed with their al-Qaeda
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.760]  proxy armies?
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.760]  That's right.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.200]  Well, we don't have to get around to that because that doesn't serve our foreign policy
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.800]  goals or Washington's hegemony over the rest of the world.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.560]  The Charlie Hebdo does see whether or not this was a false flag attack or whether it
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.000]  was a real legitimate terrorist attack.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.040]  The outcome is the same.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.200]  Three goals were achieved.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:33.440]  One is France has been pulled back under Washington's thumb, they're back under Washington's
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.680]  foreign policy orbit.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:41.960]  We have to remember just very recently, the French voted with the Palestinians.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.600]  They took a position different from the American Israeli position.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:55.360]  The British themselves, if memory serves right, abstained so that this showed two of the most
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.280]  influential European countries moving away from the American position.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.120]  Also very recently, the President of France announced that the economic sanctions against
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.600]  Russian must end.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.120]  So this is another break in the cooperation with Washington's foreign policy.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:24.560]  So when you have something like this terrorist shooting in Paris, you cow the French and
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.640]  you bring them back under your thumb.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:37.360]  Also we see the effect of the shooting is to undermine what was a growing European sympathy
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.400]  for the Palestinians.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.920]  This is not because the Palestinians were involved in shootings, but Muslims are generally
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:48.720]  Muslims and so they're tainted by it.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:57.120]  And also there was growing European opposition to the new war that Washington is ginning
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.480]  up in the Middle East against the Islamic State.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:07.040]  The Europeans have had enough of this and they know it doesn't serve their purpose.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.600]  Many of them have large Muslim populations and they understand that these populations
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:18.680]  are beginning to be radicalized by the incessant bombing and killing of Muslims in the Middle
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.680]  East.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.240]  And so they were tired of this and were not supporting the American policy, which was
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.880]  making it difficult for the policy to go forward because Washington always needs cover.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:36.360]  If it just goes and acts on its own, it faces charges that it's committing war crimes, but
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.360]  if it has accomplices, they can all say, oh, this is necessary to do.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.000]  See, we all agree.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.880]  We all agree this is necessary to do.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.960]  It's a NATO operation, blah, blah.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:56.240]  And so the terrorist, if that's what it was, the Charlie Hindu affair brings a hawk to
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.360]  all of this independent thinking and reorganize it behind Washington.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.160]  Well, I mean, here's a larger question.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:08.320]  How can we as a culture be held hostage by 20 dead people when automobiles kill that many
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.000]  people a day in France, and it's way more than that a day here in the U.S. is in the
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  hundreds?
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.080]  And since when can the media just take something and make it such a spectacle?
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.880]  And then we're all shaking in fear.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.640]  Clearly, whether it's staged or real, it's being used to pass draconian censorship in
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:30.160]  France and the U.S. with a cover of March's for free speech.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.360]  It is so Kafkaesque.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.040]  It's so Orwellian.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.320]  It makes my head spin.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.320]  And it really makes me fear for the future of our civilization.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.600]  Yes, and legitimate.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:49.880]  So to keep in mind, the main effect of this is to put Europe back under Washington's control.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.480]  They're no longer opposing the war in the Middle East.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:01.040]  They're no longer flocking to the Palestinian's cause, and they're no longer speaking about
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.240]  independent foreign policies.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:12.400]  So it has served a purpose, whether it was a real attack or a false flag attack.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.400]  And that is the main effect of this.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:22.880]  It basically means that the independence of a European foreign policy that the Russian
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:30.720]  government has been hoping would evolve in order to cool down the conflict and the growing
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:34.640]  NATO bases on their border and the trouble in the Ukraine.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:43.040]  This has now been stopped in its tracks because Europe is now back on board with Washington.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:50.200]  So this is a very big and serious consequence of the Charlie Hebdo event.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:56.360]  What do you think it signified that Obama's people didn't basically show up at the PR
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.360]  March?
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.960]  B, what do you make of the coming prosecution of Petraeus?
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:08.920]  Well, I don't know about the prosecution, but it seems clear to me that the reason Obama
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:16.960]  would not show up at the March in Paris is that if the American president is there, it
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.880]  takes on the look of an American operation.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:27.560]  And it makes it too obvious that France is now back in America's pockets.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:33.840]  But if he doesn't go, and a lower order person goes, or merely the ambassador goes, then
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:43.040]  it de-emphasizes in people's minds the association of what happened with American purposes.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:51.640]  And therefore, it doesn't make the false flag aspect stand out, it just sort of says, well,
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:57.000]  you know, why didn't Obama come, well, you know, who knows, but it leaves it without
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.040]  the mark of American operation.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.680]  If the president is there, he is the most important person there.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.880]  And then everybody gets to thinking about America.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.480]  Well, I mean, as you point out in your article that's up on infowars.com and also on your
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:19.040]  website that we're linked to there, PaulCraigRoberts.org, you point out the total precision up front,
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.760]  then there are a bunch of bumbling, many hills running around in circles, falling over their
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.280]  shoelaces.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.280]  After that, it doesn't jive.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.520]  It doesn't jive.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.640]  We'll never know whether it was a false flag attack.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:41.120]  It has clearly many characteristics of one, there are many very puzzling aspects to it.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:48.920]  But I think the most outstanding suspicious aspect is that these highly professional
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:57.240]  killers who did such a professional military style attack, they escaped and they leave
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.560]  their ID in the car conveniently for authorities.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.240]  I mean, really, we heard this about 9-11, right?
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.080]  Yeah, the passports that didn't get burned and then magically got found that day on the
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.080]  rubble.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:16.440]  Yeah, the passport is the only surviving thing in the two Twin Towers.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:22.400]  And so, and so here we see that card again used.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.080]  The system really thinks we're stupid.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:30.840]  I think, as I said, in one of my columns, they make it more and more hard to believe
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.000]  and when everybody believes it, they sit back and laugh at us.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.760]  Well, you are in the highest levels of government, you're in some big think tanks.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.000]  I know we've had corruption in the power structure forever, but it's never seen to
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  be this mentally ill and this, I mean, it's like Gibbs a few years ago saying, I was
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.080]  to lie and say the drone program didn't exist even though it was public.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.920]  There's a psychological tactic here, I think, to create learned helplessness or kind of
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.960]  a mass Stockholm syndrome of normalcy bias to where it's just so over the top, we just
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.960]  give in.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:13.240]  It may be, but keep, keep in mind now, Alex, I was in the government prior to the fall
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:19.320]  of the Soviet Union and therefore American power was constrained and did not have the
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.320]  same ambitions.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.720]  But when the Soviet Union collapsed and let the Neil conservatives loose, they said, well,
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.960]  look, there's no longer any constraint on American power, we can do what we want.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.640]  They wrote articles in PNX saying we can take over the world, all we need is false flags
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.960]  and they publish it.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.960]  That's right.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.520]  So what I'm saying is that by experience in government was a different kind of government.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:52.520]  It was a government that was constrained, a government that basically did not want any
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:57.960]  risk of nuclear war because understood there's no winter and therefore it didn't do the
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:03.840]  kinds of things that began with the Soviet class.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.680]  So that is a fundamental difference.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.080]  There's no comparability between Reagan and the later regime.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.080]  Well, sure.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.680]  And most of our government for all its problems were combat vets and a lot of them were lawyers,
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:23.480]  but now it's almost all lawyers, PR hacks, almost none of them have been in combat.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:28.760]  And I really think they themselves don't realize how much danger they're putting the world
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.760]  in.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:35.320]  I think they're a bunch of smart, focused, corrupt people, but I just don't think they
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.200]  have the instinctive fear they should of the power they're misusing.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:46.480]  Well, the Neil conservatives are in charge and they want power.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480]  They are after.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:53.360]  They won't, they won't American his enemy over the world, that includes Russian child.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.720]  And therefore, when they are greedy for power, they're not, they're not down.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.600]  No, I understand their power craze.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600]  Let me ask you this.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]  Closing.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  Yeah.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.820]  Let me ask you this in closing.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:11.680]  In your gut or looking at it, how are they doing the state of the world right now in
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.680]  about 50 seconds?
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.680]  I mean, how are they?
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.680]  How are the bad guys doing?
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:20.160]  Well, I think with Charlie Hebdo, they've had a huge success.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.520]  Whether they are responsible for it or not, it has produced for the new conservatives
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.400]  a huge success.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:32.760]  And this means we're going to see more pressure on Russia and their bound China because the
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:38.760]  two countries that form a strategic alliance and we're going to see a war on the Islamic
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:44.880]  state and the and we're also hold on, finish up on the other side.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.760]  I want you to finish that thought and we'll let you go, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:57.040]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:05.560]  From the water table to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:10.440]  more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.640]  air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.680]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.680]  within their homes.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.080]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.560]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.560]  to as well.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.680]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:41.720]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720]  back against.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.960]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.400]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.520]  with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.240]  When cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:09.360]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.640]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.920]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.240]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:07.920]  And the truth is it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food and our
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.680]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.400]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals,
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.760]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:25.240]  I could see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.800]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:32.120]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWarsLife Resolution Pack, combining
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:37.840]  three essential formulations, oxygen based cleanser oxy powder, the secret 12 bioavailable
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.960]  vitamin B12, and your choice of super female or super male vitality, now all available
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.120]  at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.120]  success.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:57.560]  The InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139, 2015 is the year to do it, and it all starts at
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:06.040]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:12.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:31.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.280]  I wanted Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, again the former editor of the Wall Street Journal,
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.280]  father of Reaganomics, the head of policy department of the Treasury, under Reagan,
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.640]  to finish up his prospectus for 2015.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:49.320]  Ron Paul, Dr. Paul was on yesterday and said he thinks 2015 is basically the big one.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.240]  He got Donald Trump saying that.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:58.040]  Most economists are saying this year they just don't see how the charade can go on.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.720]  But I've seen it get pushed back.
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:03.400]  I mean, I remember Roberts, when folks thought three years ago it was going to implode, he
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.960]  said, no, I give it three, four years.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.960]  Well, we're three, four years later.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:13.400]  And I just don't know how they square putting ISIS in charge, giving them $10 billion, letting
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.800]  them launch attacks on Assad, and now we've got to go fight ISIS, but then they're caught
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.040]  giving them airdrops of weapons.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:23.520]  I think fighting ISIS is the cover for bombing Assad's forces.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.640]  In fact, Obama has said we need to take Assad out.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.040]  That's why ISIS got a foothold.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.760]  No, ISIS got a foothold because our government put him in there.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.320]  And this has really woken the military up.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:39.200]  So what I'm getting at here is I don't see how this agenda can continue on.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.360]  But as you said three years ago, it always continues on historically longer than we think.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:51.160]  But then overnight sometimes these empires, based on lies fall, or it could die slowly,
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.680]  or it could, I guess, take the planet over if everyone submits to it.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.640]  So Dr. Roberts, for about five minutes, you've got the floor and I'll let you go.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.360]  What's up with your global perspective and where you see this going?
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:15.160]  Well, I think that what's working against the neoconservatives is a neglect of the economy.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:25.160]  And so they're so focused on world power and on the financial hedgenomy of the United States
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:32.960]  that they're not paying attention to the fact that the economy itself is expiring and there's
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:40.120]  no growth consumer incomes, there's no good jobs for people, not even for university graduates.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:46.320]  The workforce is shrinking in size because of the lack of jobs.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:54.440]  The debt continues to build and at some point debt has to be serviced, it can't be.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:01.280]  So I think they're overlooking the economic landmines while they are greedily chasing
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.000]  after power.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:10.280]  And so this is the hope that the economy blows up and they have no way to deal with it.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:21.680]  You have to keep in mind that leadership passes into empire and empire begets insolence and
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.920]  insolence brings right.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:34.240]  And when you see the United States, which has now a very weak economy, challenging both
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:42.880]  Russia and China in some sort of world supremacy contest, that neither Russia nor China had
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:50.720]  any interest in being part of, but this combination of Russia and China is simply too much for
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:57.080]  the neoconservatives given the weakened state of the United States economy.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:04.520]  So I think it is true that this could be the year that all of this blows up in their faces
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:14.840]  despite the success that they have just had with the Paris shootings.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.840]  What else?
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.640]  I'm just there deep in thought.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:24.520]  What else can we do as individuals, Dr. Roberts, from your historical experience and governmental
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:30.920]  experience, journalistic experience, what can we do to ensure that we don't have a
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:37.400]  global collapse, that we don't, in their death rows or reaching for ultimate power, all basically
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.080]  get destroyed in a thermal nuclear war?
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:44.720]  I mean, isn't it just that journalists and people in government and media and every other
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.400]  profession out there need to realize how dire our straits are and not just be so comfortable
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.240]  that we just abdicate our responsibility and let a bunch of madmen run the world?
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.200]  I mean, what else can we do to try to ensure this doesn't happen?
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.280]  Well, it's probably nothing.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.560]  You know, there are no more independent institutions.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:15.000]  And journalism is no longer an independent institution, it's owned by five or six major
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.200]  companies.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.200]  They're dependent on the government for the broadcasting licenses.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.440]  And indeed, this is an old hack type thing.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.640]  Ever since the Cold War, journalists have said that they have to be on the side of the
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.400]  government or otherwise they're not patriotic and that they are patriotic and so they take
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  the government side.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:42.320]  You know, just the other day, the New York Times editor or former editor gave a speech
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.640]  publicly and said that, well, New York Times has to support the government.
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.560]  That's what we do because we're patriotic.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:54.640]  And so if we have to mislead the people in order to support the government, we're going
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.320]  to do that.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.560]  So you know, whereas journalism, they're not part of the country.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:07.280]  It's the Ministry of Propaganda, all people can do is simply not fall for the government
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:08.280]  schemes.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:09.280]  They have to be aware.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.560]  Now, I don't know what any sort of resistance can come out of that.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.800]  But as long as people don't believe what they're told, there's more than if they do believe
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.800]  what they're told.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.320]  And I think that's what motivates me from youth.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.360]  Well, Paul Craig Roberts dot O-R-G is the website.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.080]  It's excellent.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.640]  We see attempts to censor new independent media.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:40.800]  We see attempts to bring in free speech controls because the establishment understands that
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:45.800]  it is information in the final equation and truth.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:52.080]  And people just removing their consent and their financial support from the system that
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.080]  will force it to change.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.600]  But you're right, the hubris, the insolence is the stuff historically that that causes
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.640]  racket ruin, and I hope we can turn it around.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.600]  Thank you so much, Dr. Roberts, for joining us.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.840]  Please be with us.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.520]  Always great to have you on.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.320]  Paul Craig Roberts dot O-R-G again is his site.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:17.880]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are our major sites.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.800]  Jared is active duty Army and has been holding and wants to give his take on the new poll
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.960]  out showing Obama has only a 15% approval rating and active duty.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:34.640]  We'll go to Joe, who's also ex-Army, and Rambo, and Oregon, who has family members that are
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.400]  in and wants to give us his take on that.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.080]  But we've heard unanimously it's not about gays in the military, and I'm not saying that's
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.360]  good for morale or whatever.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.880]  I'm not endorsing or not endorsing.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.240]  The point is it's a football issue.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:52.400]  The real issue is the corruption, the government drug dealing, the working with radical Islamists,
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.920]  the training the military for domestic operations, gun confiscation, the open training of ISIS,
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.920]  and others.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.640]  This has got the military really awake.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.200]  Now, Darren McBrain put together a five minute report.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.800]  It's extremely powerful that we only heard part of at the start of the broadcast today.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.440]  I want to hear the whole thing now here for radio and TV viewers.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.840]  If you're a radio listener, you want to go to infowars.com, where you can see the free
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.000]  video feed because it's very powerful to see these congressional testimony pieces, news
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  clips.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.280]  Now I want to warn folks, some of the footage is graphic and is violent, but it's documentary
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280]  in nature.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.520]  And then we'll go to Jared, Rambo, Joe, and others.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:40.440]  Then we've got Harry Dent joining us, who is, again, an excellent financial analyst.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:44.920]  He predicted a couple of years ago on the show that it would be deflation that got us
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.720]  not inflation.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:51.360]  And he predicted the oil going down, the demographic cliff, all of it, it's now happening.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.880]  So he's going to be joining us and we'll take your phone calls in the second half of the
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.880]  interview.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.640]  One of the most powerful pieces that Darren McBreen has put out so far of many powerful
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:02.640]  pieces were blessed.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.480]  If it's a great crew of people like Jacarie Jackson and Darren McBreen and Rob Dew and
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.840]  John Bown and so many others, Rob Jacobson, the list goes on and on that put out these
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.000]  video montage reports.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.120]  So here is one right now.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:29.720]  The Bloody Laundry of the CIA.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:34.520]  Appeared before the congressional committee, the highest representation of the American
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:40.040]  people under subpoena to tell what I knew of activities, which I believe might lead
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.560]  to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.880]  Does America owe its edge in military technology to Nazi war criminals brought here after World
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:48.880]  War II?
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.400]  The truth is, the thousands of former Nazis, some of whom committed atrocities, went to
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.880]  work for the United States government.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:08.360]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks?
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.960]  This I think gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.040]  to get into in the executive session.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:22.360]  At CBS, we had been contacted by the CIA, as a matter of fact, by the time I became the
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.560]  head of the whole News and Public Affairs operation in 1954.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:30.080]  Ships had been established and I was told about them and asked if I'd carry on with
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.080]  them.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.280]  We're really talking about intelligence at the highest levels of the U.S. government,
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.120]  setting the broad direction for the nation.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:44.560]  Have you brought with you some of those devices which would have enabled the CIA to use this
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:51.960]  poison for, we have indeed, for killing people, but also the toxin itself would not appear
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:52.960]  in the autopsy?
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.960]  Yes.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:59.120]  But when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.880]  If you've been anywhere near a television set or a radio these past few hours, you already
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.520]  know that John Lennon of the Beatles is dead.
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:13.400]  He was shot late this evening in front of his apartment building in New York City.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:18.440]  Despite evidence that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking, Bush kept Noriega on
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.440]  the payroll.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.400]  We interrupt your regular programming to tell you of a plane crash in northeastern Minnesota
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:26.480]  where we have just had confirmed a short while ago.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:31.760]  Eight people were killed on a small beach aircraft that was on its way to Evelynette,
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.120]  Minnesota, including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.560]  And according to the senior staff in the senator's office, not only the senator but
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.560]  his wife Sheila, his daughter, three members of his staff, and the two pilots.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.120]  The CIA has been, and is now, completely out of control.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:58.240]  The accusation is that drugs are being sold by the Contras and that the CIA knew about
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:13.560]  it and didn't do anything.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:28.000]  William Colby has been missing since April 27.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  His canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Waikomiko River, April 28.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:48.840]  When George Bush became director of the CIA in 1976, he inherited Noriega as a contact.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:59.200]  When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related, indicted dictator, this count
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:10.000]  of they are total lies.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:16.520]  In 1976, flight 455, which took off from Venezuela bound for Cuba, suddenly exploded.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:37.840]  All 73 passengers and five crew members aboard died after the plane crashed near Barbados.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:42.640]  More of the terrorists were found to be Latin Americans contracted by the U.S.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:54.160]  One of the attacks masterminds, Posada Capriles, currently lives freely in Miami.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.640]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.560]  I will tell you, Director Doigt has a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective that
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:11.480]  the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:16.360]  He has never tolerated outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.360]  the 11th.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:33.640]  The numbers about potential civilian casualties, I take with a somewhat big grain of salt,
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:34.640]  let us bomb these places.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.160]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:39.160]  My sister-in-law.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.160]  I love Bill Clinton.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.160]  Thank you.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:48:07.160]  Thank you Morgan.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:15.200]  Watching that is frightening, and of course the CIA is just one of the big agencies involved
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:22.200]  in all this, and it has been former CIA people that have been the most outspoken about it.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.960]  The road to perdition has been paved by the statement that, well, the end justifies the
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.360]  means, that they are sort of doing all this evil stuff to fight the Nazis under OSS and
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.640]  then the Russians under CIA.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:41.160]  But at the same time, the very robber barons running this country that founded the CIA
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:49.400]  in 47, were the ones putting the communists in power, and that's declassified.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.240]  Just like they helped create the radical Islamists and gave them bases and weapons, and when
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.160]  they'd been defeated after a 14-year war, they gave them new bases.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.800]  And now they're worse than ever, and have quote, metastasized, and we're going to get
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:03.800]  attacked.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.680]  Give our rights up when it happens.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.080]  I appreciate Jared, who we're going to next after we've got a break, and then Rambo and
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.080]  Joe Holding will get to all of you.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:18.080]  And then our guest is joining us to get into what we're expecting in 2015.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:24.360]  I don't like the Fiat bubble system, but I'll tell you, I hope it doesn't implode in 2015.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.720]  People say, oh yeah, that'll bring them down.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.720]  Oh no.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.480]  They're going to get more power out of the implosion when they're ready.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.440]  I don't want the bubble to implode.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:36.040]  I want it to be exposed, discussed, and then create alternate systems.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.880]  Of course, I'd like to not die either, I guess.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.920]  I mean, we're in this mess.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.080]  It's going to happen.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.080]  We're going to crash.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.080]  The question is how bad will it be?
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.200]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.160]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.400]  We're all risking our lives, our names, our treasure to do this.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.560]  It is the fact that there are a lot of good people in the system.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.960]  It is the fact that I'm still alive, and the good Lord above, of course, number one in
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.800]  your prayers, but we need money to finance this operation.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.720]  We're not funded by JPMorgan or the Globalist or any big corporate interest.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.760]  We're funded by Ubi and the High Quality Products at infowarstore.com.

[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:17.640]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.160]  Hear that?
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:37.160]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:40.120]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.640]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.840]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:51.560]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:55.760]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.320]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:51:59.820]  FakeTV.com.
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:05.120]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.800]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:11.800]  with sex.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:16.680]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Superbeta
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:19.720]  Prostate to listeners of this station.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:24.400]  Superbeta Prostate is a non-prescription formula guaranteed to reduce the symptoms of your
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.040]  enlarged prostate.

[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:32.880]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:38.080]  In clinical trials, the ingredient in Superbeta Prostate was shown to reduce urges to urinate,
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:43.480]  improve bladder emptying, reduce waking at night to urinate, and improve quality of life.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:47.760]  This Superbeta Prostate free offer is for listeners of this station.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.280]  But it won't last.
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:50.280]  Don't wait.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.360]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.440]  That's 1-800-852-1820.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:59.440]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:03.480]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids, and the less
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.560]  you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.920]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.560]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.560]  Not fun.
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:19.680]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:23.960]  able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:28.320]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.320]  for you.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.320]  My name is Errol.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.800]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.200]  You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.600]  I play pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement, I have
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:42.080]  more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.840]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:48.480]  using One World Way.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:51.800]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:54:20.600]  That's 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.440]  By the way, I'm not going to air it on radio and TV.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.840]  We're probably well on the nightly news tonight.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:28.520]  The headline is Alex Jones to retire.
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:35.280]  It is satire, and it's designed to basically make fun of the real conspiracy theorists that
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:37.680]  are out there.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.680]  It's pretty funny.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:44.120]  If you want to go see it, it's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, and we just tweeted it
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.880]  out at realalexjones, and it's on our Facebook.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:53.640]  And so it's a good way to basically upset all the schizophrenics out there that claim
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.600]  that I'm Bill Hicks and stuff.
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.680]  It's pretty hilarious.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:03.120]  I was here being interviewed for a documentary last week about Russia and about oligarchs,
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:07.080]  and then I just said, Kevin was making a documentary about it, and I said, hey, let's do a joke
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.580]  while you're here.
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:14.120]  And so we did it, and it's pretty funny, and it's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.120]  right now.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.120]  Jared, thank you for holding your active duty army.
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:25.080]  You wanted to give us your take on this national poll of active duty, only 15% approve of Obama,
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:27.200]  and they're claiming it's because of gays in the military.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.520]  They didn't even ask that question.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:31.520]  That's what they say in the article.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:37.200]  The military I've talked to, it's because they know Obama is selling the country out.
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.840]  What do you have to say about this?
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.840]  Hello, Alex.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.680]  It has nothing to do with the gays in the military issue.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:50.240]  It's being lied to continually, and watching the constitution that we've sworn to support
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:56.120]  and defend with our lives being trampled upon continuously.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.000]  Talk about your view or the other servicemen you talk to and women, what their average
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.640]  view is of the so-called commander in chief?
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.720]  It's not good, and a lot of us don't talk about it because of repercussions.
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.520]  Well, obviously, I don't think they know who you are right now, and they try to check
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.440]  your phone records or violate the constitution with the NSA.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.080]  But do you agree with my statement that it's over the training for domestic operations
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:30.920]  against patriots, that it's over the open borders, that it's over being connected to
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.920]  ISIS?
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.640]  I mean, can you tell us what some of the concerns are?
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:42.680]  All that and more, and it's nickel and diamond away the constitution.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.880]  There's no business for us to be training in a United States urban environment unless
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:52.880]  that's where they plan to operate at.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.240]  And then you get to manuals and find out it's for veterans.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:00.840]  They openly teach, this is national news, that the main enemy of the Pentagon will be
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.840]  veterans.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:06.360]  Now, what type of America is this where the veterans are the enemy?
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.280]  I mean, what are they going to do that's going to make the veterans so mad that the
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.560]  army is going to have to fight them?
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.000]  It's not the America I grew up in.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.800]  Well, it may fly, you know, funding Al Qaeda and all this, but it's not going to fly starting
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:22.920]  a civil war.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:26.360]  The police know what's going on now on average.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:29.520]  That's what they want is fighting with them so that we don't join forces with them.
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.880]  And the military knows, let me ask you this, do you think 15% of the military supporting
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:37.720]  Obama is a high number or a low number?
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.760]  I'm thinking that's an excessively high number.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:44.560]  Yeah, the number I've got's about 5%.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.960]  That would sound more along the lines of being right.
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:50.880]  Yeah, this pulse is 15.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:58.120]  Do you think it'll fly if, say, a bomb goes off in a federal building and then they say,
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.880]  oh, we've got to arrest the Patriots?
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.840]  Do you think that'll fly with the military?
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.400]  Oh, no.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.680]  It would not fly at all.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:06.680]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:12.640]  Is the military aware of the false flag paradigm and things that the globalists might pull?
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.080]  A lot more than they'll hear is waking up to it and they're seeing through the false flags.
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.520]  Very exciting news.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:22.480]  And that's the good news is that's what I'm getting from all my sources.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.200]  High up, low level, you name it.
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.520]  All right, Jared, anything else you want to add?
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.520]  No, thanks for the time, Alex.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:29.960]  Yeah, God bless you.
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:32.800]  Thank you for trying to serve the Republic, even though it's been seized.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:37.000]  You know, we'll need a military once we've taken the Republic back, so people do not need
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  to blame our military.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.480]  They need to blame the gloves.
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:44.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:36.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.760]  Let's finish up with these calls that have been holding ahead of our next guest joining
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.880]  us, Rambo, in Oregon.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.880]  You're on the air.
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.960]  What's your view from your military perspectives and family you say is in the military on why
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.960]  Obama is so unpopular?
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:54.680]  Well, he's really unpopular just due to the fact that, you know, years ago, he's down
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:59.360]  there bowing to Saudi princes and all just outrageous stuff that the American president
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:04.760]  doesn't do that really upsets the military, and it just shows that he just does not have
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:07.320]  Wabos or Wavos or whatever you want to call him.
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:08.960]  He just doesn't have them.
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:13.280]  And it's really upsetting the military, but my cousin, who's a former Air Force pilot
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:18.560]  and top gun, he, for years and years, he'd tell me about how I'm crazy about false flags
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:19.560]  and all this.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:24.280]  So one year, I went over there and brought him some movies, Terror, Storm and Road to
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.280]  Tyranny.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.200]  And well, he watched them about a week later, he said, Hey, we got to have lunch and had
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.200]  lunch.
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.080]  And he just gave me a big hug and said, Hey, man, I'm really sorry.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:37.520]  I talked to some people, aeronautical engineers and people on the inside and what you guys
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.880]  say is true and what they say is totally impossible.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.720]  And ever since then, he's had such a huge awakening, waking countless others up like
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:46.720]  that.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.080]  And the piece that Darren McBrain did earlier with CIA, I thought was great.
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.920]  And if he could include a clip from the Barry Steele CIA drug smuggler piece, that would
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.440]  be, that would be just key on that as well.
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.440]  What do you think?
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.680]  Well, that's part of the problem.
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.920]  There's so many CIA crimes.
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:10.960]  I should say criminal gangs operating inside the CIA crimes, using it as an organization
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:14.720]  to carry out their operations, that it'd be a hundred hours long.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.520]  But absolutely, I'm sure Darren will do a part two.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.040]  He really likes working on stuff, exposing the CIA.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040]  So great points.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  God bless you.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.000]  Joe in Texas, Joe, you're on the air.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  Thank you.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  Former Army.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:36.600]  I was a former Army infantryman, I was in during Obama's first term, and I'd called
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.520]  into the show before regarding a similar issue.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:46.960]  But basically, the last caller who was talking about the stigma that's attached to you, if
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:52.680]  you speak out or the retaliation is true, there's an unofficial way to deal with people
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680]  who are outspoken.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:03:00.240]  But I myself was outspoken about how I felt about the Commander-in-Chief, and there's
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:04.520]  three types of people that you'll run into when you do that.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:10.960]  The number one is people who don't like what's going on, but they're not very informed.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.120]  And then you have the informed people who are scared to say anything, but then you run
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.920]  into the third, which is the people who are literally sitting down talking to the gentleman
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.200]  with a print of mine in the chow hall, and we went over it, as I know, but I'm on the
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.200]  winning team.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.200]  So I'm okay.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.200]  Oh, I know.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.200]  They're the worst.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:34.280]  People that know there's a criminal takeover, and then they think because they join it in
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.080]  their mind that they're part of it.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.000]  They're the biggest chumps, the biggest cowards.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.280]  They believe that they're going to join evil and win when they're the first type of people
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.920]  the establishment is going to destroy.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.040]  They are so stupid.
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.040]  I mean, not even one tenth of one percent stands to gain from this world government.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:56.000]  This world government is anti-human.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.720]  Look at Liam Neeson.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.680]  I think he's a great actor, and now I can hardly watch anything he's ever in.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:06.160]  Liam Neeson makes money with these shoot-em-up TV shows, movies.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.720]  And then he comes out and says, America has too many F-ing guns, says star Liam Neeson
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:17.240]  launches exiled of late and tirade on gun control, blames the Ebdo attack on guns in
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.240]  America.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.240]  What a dumb-ass.
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:23.920]  I mean, I'm sorry to use a word like that, but he's got bodyguards, he's rich, he's worth
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.160]  over a hundred million dollars, and then he wants our guns.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  Well, you know what?
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.400]  He knows if he talks like that, they'll give him more roles.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.320]  Just a world, a sell-out scum.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.200]  There's an example right there.
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:38.200]  And then he makes his money with shoot-em-up movies.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.600]  Probably didn't know how to use a gun.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:41.600]  What a...
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.640]  What a piece of crap.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.040]  I mean, what a piece of garbage.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:49.960]  Obama can have all the bodyguards he wants, but I can't have a gun.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:50.960]  You know what?
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:51.960]  You can go right to you-know-where.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.120]  I'm sick of you people.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:57.320]  You're morally bankrupt, and you want my guns to make me a slave, and you know it.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:01.160]  It's not that you're wrong, you're scum criminals.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:05.640]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:05.320]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape, and the truth is, it's hard.
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:10.360]  Even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:12.080]  bodies more than ever before.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:17.000]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high-quality nutraceuticals,
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.360]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:25.880]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:28.360]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.

[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:05.440]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:07.320]  been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.920]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:15.600]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:16.920]  single day?
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.000]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.800]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:27.400]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:28.400]  was.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:33.760]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:36.840]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:40.120]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:36.120]  I want to tell you about Texas radio with a big B.
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:43.480]  If you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.000]  you are the resistance.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:56.800]  One last breath before wind blows, better raise your ears, the sound of hooves knock
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:57.800]  at your door.
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:04.440]  Let's keep that rolling for a moment.
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:08.360]  Are the four horsemen coming for the stock market?
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:13.360]  Are the four horsemen coming for dollar hegemony?
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:21.080]  Are the four horsemen coming for the private federal reserve?
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.680]  Are the four horsemen of different types of deflation coming?
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.720]  Well, on to the dead of night.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.160]  We see the four horsemen ride and we are now trying to look at the different fates
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:38.120]  out there and decide which one is coming down the road because you don't have to be an economist
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.040]  to look at the world economy until it's untenable, it's unstable, it's based on bubbles, it's
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.520]  based on fraud.
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.400]  You've got giant welfare states that even dwarf us per capita in Europe.
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:54.160]  You've got demographic cliffs as we go into the second quadrant or begin to approach the
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:10:01.200]  middle of the wave of the retirement of baby boomers all over the western world.
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:06.880]  Jeffrey Dent's been coming on the show about three, four years and he's the best selling
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:13.480]  author of the demographic cliff and the editor of the free newsletter, Economy and Markets.
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:17.320]  And of course, he founded Dent Research and Economic Forecasting, Firm Specializing and
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.720]  Demographic Trends.
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.680]  His mission is helping people understand change using exciting new research developed from
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.960]  years of hands-on business experience.
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:31.160]  He also headed up a division for Bain Capital and has done a lot of other important work
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:32.160]  as well.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:33.760]  I'm going to get into all his degrees.
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:37.800]  He has an MBA from Harvard Business School and worked as, again, for Bain as a strategy
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:40.440]  consultant for Fortune 100 companies.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:45.520]  He's also the CEO of several entrepreneurial growth companies and a new venture investor.
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:53.400]  And HarryDentResearch.com is his main website, but at HarryDent.com forward slash Alex Jones,
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:59.160]  he's offering deals on his book in a free chapter, HarryDent.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:01.840]  And I wasn't even aware of this until they just walked in and told me, he's just already
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.840]  a regular guest.
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.840]  We love getting him on.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.640]  And he's also, I guess, sponsoring InfoWars today, got some banners up there promoting
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:08.640]  his new book.
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:12.040]  So we appreciate him supporting the broadcast as well.
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:16.400]  But I'll just throw that out there that people can also follow the banners to his website
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.640]  at infowars.com.
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:23.080]  But I've got to tell you, I mean, you've got all these different economists, all these
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.680]  different investors, you see them all over the news.
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:33.280]  Last year, about six months ago, we saw Donald Trump come out and say the big crash is coming.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  He's kind of the canary in the coal mine when he finally starts saying it.
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:39.760]  But most real economists say something big's coming.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.560]  Well, a lot of them say it's going to be inflation, maybe even hyperinflation because
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:47.520]  of all the QE unlimited and the race at the bottom with all the money printing worldwide,
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.320]  not just by the dollar.
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:56.760]  The problem is, then you've got other demographics showing that there's going to be less demand
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:02.040]  and more oil and gas discovered, and so prices are going to plunge.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:06.080]  And I wish we had the staff to do it, but I mean, you can go back to the 10 interviews
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.760]  or so the last three years.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:13.280]  Three years ago, he was predicting by 2015, 2016, and he has the graphs he sent us again
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:14.280]  today.
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:17.000]  We'll pull some of those up and show you the graphs he made.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.880]  He's been using for four or five years and sent his last best-selling book, New York
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.880]  Times Best Seller, that right around this time it would start, Demographic Cliff, People
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:28.360]  Retiring, Moral People Than Young People.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:29.920]  We aborted all our kids.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:30.920]  We didn't have kids.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.920]  Okay, fine.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.440]  We will be inherited by the third world.
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.280]  That is our trendy wish.
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.560]  That is the way it works.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:43.160]  There's his oil graphic that he's been putting out for at least, I first read his book four
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:46.280]  years ago and then got him on about three and a half years ago, so I guess I've been
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:49.080]  seeing him use this for four years, three or four years.
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:50.080]  But there it is.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:58.280]  His oil graph, WTI crude, 98, 2016, he has it going down, going back a few months ago,
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.280]  and that's what happened.
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:03.200]  And he's got it going down even more into 2020.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:05.960]  We've got Bloomberg out saying it takes five years to rebound.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.200]  He says it won't rebound.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.400]  Well, don't let me put words in his mouth.
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.080]  He's just made a lot of predictions that have come through so far.
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:14.200]  That's why he's the best-selling author.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.680]  People want to read what he has to say.
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:18.960]  I'm just glad he's here with us today to go through all this.
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.400]  So Harry Dent, I got to tell you, three years ago, I agreed with a lot of what you're saying,
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:28.880]  but I just could not have imagined $40 a barrel oil, but it's headed that way and lower.
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.080]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.960]  Yeah, you're right, Alex.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:36.520]  We've said for years that oil would end up at $10 to $20 a barrel.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:43.120]  Right now, we have broken recently out of a long-trading range sideways between $80
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:47.920]  and $115, and the next support is at $32.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:54.080]  I think we're going to see that this year, maybe within months, maybe within weeks.
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:58.080]  The thing about this is that falling oil prices, everybody, most economists say, oh, it's good
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.080]  for the consumer.
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:00.240]  Well, of course it is.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:05.800]  We save maybe $2 a day at lower oil prices, but it's going to burst one of the biggest
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:08.400]  bubbles we've had recently, the fracking bubble.
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:13.360]  We were told we're going to be energy-independent, and we got this great fracking revolution.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:19.560]  It's just a bubble industry without 5% junk bond rates, the lowest we've ever seen in
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:25.040]  history, normally 8% to 10% for those type of high-risk lending.
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.920]  And without $100 plus oil prices, fracking doesn't work, so fracking is dead.
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:31.920]  That's a million jobs.
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:38.000]  That's $980 billion in investment that's going to go bad, and a half a trillion dollars in
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  debt.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:45.680]  So economists are ignoring this fracking bubble burst just like they ignored the housing bubble
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:47.680]  and the subprime crisis in 2008.
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:54.080]  I mean, that's another chart I have here where if you look at the subprime bubble that grew
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:59.960]  from like 2000 to 2005 to 2006, this high-yield debt is now the new bubble where companies
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  are borrowing money for high-risk investments, cheap, courtesy of the Fed's free money falling
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:09.600]  out of the sky, and this has created a bubble that's going to burst.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:14.160]  I've been telling the Alex for years now, we've got a bubble that's going to burst.
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:17.840]  We've got demographics only going the wrong direction, more and more countries around
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:22.400]  the world, debt levels even higher than they were in 2007 and 2008 when the last bubble
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  burst.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:24.400]  Everything is set.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.680]  We just need a trigger.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:30.000]  I think this is the trigger, and the markets are ignoring it.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.920]  Well, you predicted the 2008 crash, you predicted this with oil, and I'm just going from memory.
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.200]  I first interviewed you a few times over the phone like four or five years ago, then you
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.800]  hadn't been on for a few years, started getting you on I think 2013, 2014 again, but you did
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:46.080]  make those predictions accurately.
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.080]  People did roll their eyes.
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:51.320]  I mean, I respected your view because you've been right so much, but it was hard to believe.
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:53.640]  Now it's starting to happen.
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.320]  When did you first start predicting oil would go down in 2015?
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:03.520]  We said that back in the Great Depression ahead in 2008.
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:08.560]  One of the things, Alex, we look at demographic cycles which we can project accurately.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:13.440]  We know when the average person spends the most money on toilet paper or camping equipment,
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:17.400]  and they spend the most money overall at age 46 and the most affluent people spend the
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:20.840]  most money at age 53, which is this year.
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:25.560]  The average household peak in 2007, we predicted that 20 years ago.
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.840]  The most affluent households that are still spending peak this year, so does spending
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:30.840]  on automobiles.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.400]  Everybody's saying automobiles are doing better than ever.
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:36.840]  You watch the next couple of years, they're going to go off a cliff.
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:41.080]  Germany has the steepest decline of any major country in the world, much like Japan in the
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.080]  90s.
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:45.480]  We were the only one to see that coming in late 80s because we look at demographics,
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:51.760]  but we also look at any travel cycles and commodity prices are one of the most predictable
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:52.920]  cycles over time.
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:56.120]  They peak every 29 to 30 years like a clock.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:00.200]  That's what we've been saying since 2008, commodity prices are peaking.
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:05.120]  They're going to decline not for a few years, but well into the early 2020s, and that's
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.680]  when we said oil in particular was going to go back to the lows in late 90s, early 2000s,
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:13.760]  between $10 and $20 a barrel.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:17.400]  So yeah, it is crashing, as we said.
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.160]  It will go lower.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.960]  I think you won't see that $10 to $20 maybe for a few years, but I think you are going
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:27.560]  to see $32 to $40 this year and again, maybe within months.
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:30.400]  And again, it's not a good thing.
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:38.440]  When oil crashed from 147 to 32 in 2008, a recession followed for the whole next year.
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:39.440]  So that's what we say.
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:44.280]  Yes, it's good long term for consumers, but in the short term, it is going to kill a lot
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.280]  of jobs.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:48.880]  It's going to trigger debt defaults, high yield bond rates are going to start to spike
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:49.880]  up.
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:50.880]  They already have.
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:52.600]  They've gone from 5% to 7%.
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:59.080]  The junk bonds for energy and fracking companies have gone from 5.5% to 10% recently.
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:03.480]  So this whole, this is the trigger for the next debt bubble bursting, and so economists
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:04.480]  don't see this.
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:05.840]  They think, oh, everything's okay.
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:07.520]  The Fed will bail everything out.
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.920]  You can't bail everything out and you can't cure a debt crisis with more debt.
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.160]  And that's what the Fed's trying to do.
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:18.160]  Well, I mean, Jim Bobway successfully cured debt with debt instead of Weimar Germany.
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:26.360]  Yeah, in history, when you try to cure debt with debt, you end up either in an inflationary
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:29.800]  blowout and or a deflationary crash.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:36.400]  And we see, and we've been saying consistently, and a lot of very smart people who understand
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:41.640]  the debt crisis is unsustainable, we've been saying, no, this ends in deflation and all
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:42.640]  we've seen.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:44.160]  Europe's worried about deflation.
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:50.000]  US is worried about deflation, commodity prices are collapsing, older people are deflationary,
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.840]  young people cost everything to raise, old people downsize everything.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:58.720]  We're deflationary and debt, deleveraging, and it will end up deleveraging.
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:02.840]  We're going to have to write off a lot of debt, a lot of student loans, subprime, auto
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:03.840]  loans, subprime.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:05.680]  Because it's impossible to prop up the debt.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.240]  It has to be written off.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:11.600]  It has to be written off ultimately, either through a crash or if the government were
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:17.080]  smart, they would orchestrate a chapter 11 reorganization, especially of our private
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:18.080]  debt.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:19.080]  That's what they could do.
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:20.080]  They don't want to just let a depression happen.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:23.200]  But no one wants to preside over that and they want to keep gambling till the casino
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:24.200]  burns down.
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:26.080]  Now there's smoke in the casino.
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:27.720]  They can see flames.
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:30.960]  The smoke detectors are going off, but they just tell us everything's fine.
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:33.760]  Yeah, everybody wants it to happen later.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:37.960]  Nobody, no central banker, no president, no prime minister anywhere in the world wants
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:39.560]  to have the next great depression.
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:41.480]  And that's what debt deleveraging is.
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:46.080]  Every depression in history is followed, a major debt bubble, and that depression and
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:49.880]  that deflation in prices is because we have debt deleveraging.
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:51.280]  We're destroying money.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:54.320]  Financial assets are deleveraging, destroying money.
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.120]  We overproduce in a bubble.
[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:57.120]  That's right.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.120]  Stay there.
[02:19:58.120 --> 02:19:59.120]  I want to hear about the next shoe to drop.
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:00.120]  Is China the time bomb?
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:02.120]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.280]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:10.280]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from discountnutritionshop.com, so I'm here totally on time.
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:11.920]  Discountnutritionshop.com?
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:13.440]  Yup, they're a lifesaver.
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:16.760]  In more ways than one, they have all the nutritional supplements you need.
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:23.760]  The major brands you know, plus you can save up to 10% right down this number, 888-908-4548.
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:24.760]  Huh?
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:29.160]  888-908-4548, or just go to discountnutritionshop.com.
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:32.360]  Mom, I can't do it, Math Homer.
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:33.680]  I just don't get it.
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:35.280]  I hate math.
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:39.800]  I've always tried to be a good mother, but when it came to Jamie's math, I was at a loss.
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:44.440]  When a friend told me about Math Made Easy DVDs, concepts are simplified in an easy
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:48.520]  way to follow and review, and students can learn at their own pace in the convenience
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:49.520]  of home.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:57.520]  Listen in the frustration, call Math Made Easy, call now 1-800-USA-MATH, that's 1-800-872-6284,

[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:10.320]  good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system, but I go further with Super nascent
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:13.240]  iodine X2 from infowarslive.com.
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:19.480]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula, coming from a deep
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:22.800]  earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:28.040]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:33.520]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits, and is tested
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:35.520]  and proven to be completely pure.

[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:27.880]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:33.880]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:37.480]  Good thing we have the Berkey system, it's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:41.360]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:43.280]  only pure, delicious water.
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:44.280]  I know, right?
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:45.280]  You love it too!
[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:46.920]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:48.120]  Let's go get some.

[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:23.720]  Alex Jones, retirement announced.
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:28.760]  And it's a satire video, if you want to see it, I think it's pretty funny.
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.440]  It's causing a whole new conspiracy.
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.440]  It's ridiculous.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.320]  But that's up on infowarge.com and prisonplanet.com.

[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:00.360]  This is a short segment, a long segment coming up.
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:04.720]  I'd like to give the number out if it's okay with you and let folks ask some questions
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:11.280]  at 800-259-9231, 800-2599-231 of Mr. Dent.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:17.560]  So, you accurately, in your book 2008 or 2007, predicted what happened then, you predicted
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:25.120]  that in this graph that by 2015 or a little bit before, we'd see oil start plunging.
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:26.520]  How will that affect the economy?
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.040]  I want to finish up with that and then other big shoes to drop.
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:31.040]  Where does all this go?
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.720]  How do people protect themselves?
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:35.880]  And then you talk about China could be the detonator.
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:40.800]  Do we see a collapse quickly or is it slowly or we just don't know?
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:44.560]  You know, I really do think this oil price fall is the trigger.
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:48.480]  All it takes to trigger, I mean, the markets have been acting like there's no risk in
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:49.480]  the world.
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:54.680]  You've got civil wars everywhere all over the Middle East and Russia and Ukraine and
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:58.800]  problems in Africa and falling commodity prices, all this sort of stuff.
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:00.280]  The markets are ignoring this.
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:04.000]  They're just thinking, well, the Fed will just bail us out of the Fed will just print
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  more money.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.200]  And so it takes a trigger, something to get the markets to see, oh my gosh, there is risk
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:13.000]  in the world and then the antennas go up.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.720]  So I think China is the last thing to hit and the hardest.
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:20.920]  We don't need no bubbles.
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:24.280]  We don't need no debt compared to China.
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:33.080]  China's debt in the last 14 years has grown nine times as fast as US debt in the 14 years
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.280]  into our bubble peak and debt in 2008.
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:43.000]  China has moved 220 million people from rural areas to urban areas with absolutely no skills
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.040]  and they're having them build stock for nobody.
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:53.600]  They got 30% vacant condos, 30% to 40% excess capacity in cement, steel, aluminum, all the
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.600]  basic industry.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:58.400]  They've got bridges to nowhere, empty malls and office buildings.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:03.600]  This is the craziest economy ever, the greatest debt bubble, the greatest overbuilding bubble
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:05.440]  and yet clueless economies.
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:10.680]  And I understate this, clueless economists say that this is the new state-driven model
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:11.680]  of capitalism.
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:17.080]  There is no way government's crony capitalism from the top down can make better decisions
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:20.000]  than a bottoms up free market system with some good rules.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  There's no way and they never have.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  Russia proved this.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.720]  But no, everybody thinks China's the new model.
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:30.840]  China has created, marked my words, the greatest bubble in modern history and there will not
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:32.880]  be a soft landing when they finally go down.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:36.360]  It's going to be the biggest real estate class, the greatest debt bubble.
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:41.920]  These 220 million people with no skills and urban areas are going to be trapped with no
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.040]  jobs and they can't even go back to their farms because they paved them over with empty
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.040]  condos.
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.080]  At least they'll be able to squat in these empty condos.
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.000]  China is going to be the biggest disaster in history and it's going to prove finally
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:01.200]  to economists who don't know better because they never had, never run a business, never
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:02.200]  had sex.
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.880]  They never had a work-fan consumer or anything.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:09.120]  It's going to prove to them that capitalism works better as long as you have some good
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:10.120]  simple rules.
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.440]  So I think this is going to be a useful lesson but it's going to be painful.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:18.800]  So I think we start this crisis because these fracking companies go under and that kills
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:26.440]  jobs and debts defaults and then there's another $6 trillion to emerging country companies
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:32.080]  from US debt and bonds that's going to default next and then it just keeps going until we
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:34.120]  now we have another housing crisis.
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:39.280]  Is that why Homeland Security's militarizing police deploying thousands of armored vehicles
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:44.320]  and basically telling the military to prepare for martial law is that anything is going
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:45.320]  to get out of hand?
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:47.480]  Well, you know, if they're smart, they would.
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:53.400]  I mean, I do fear civil unrest in this country and I can't even imagine the civil unrest
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.960]  when 220 million people are just basically left on alert.
[02:28:57.960 --> 02:29:00.920]  These people are not registered citizens in these cities.
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:05.040]  They're only registered in their rural areas and like I said, most of them can't go back
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:06.040]  there.
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:16.360]  And if China implodes, Japan's already collapsing, the West is trying to bankrupt Russia.
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:18.520]  We can't export the implosion.
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:21.200]  Won't other countries imploding only make us implode?
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:22.200]  Yes.
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:23.200]  I mean, that's what happened.
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.240]  That's what happened in the Great Depression when things started to go down, all countries
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.440]  all put up trade tariffs and that just hurt world trade worth.
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:35.120]  But what countries are doing today, they're printing money to devalue their currency and
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.920]  make their exports more competitive.
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:38.920]  Harry Dent, stay there.
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:41.200]  I want you to come back and break down how you see this coming together.
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:44.880]  I mean, your next production, the next big shoot-a-drop and phone calls.
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:45.880]  Straight ahead.
[02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:46.880]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:47.880]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:53.880]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[02:29:53.880 --> 02:30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.600]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:08.280]  And the truth is, it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our
[02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:12.040]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.760]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high-quality nutraceuticals,
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:21.080]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked.
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:25.560]  I could see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:28.120]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:32.440]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining
[02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:38.160]  three essential formulations, oxygen-based cleanser oxy-powder, the secret 12 bioavailable
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:42.320]  vitamin B12, and your choice of super-female or super-male vitality.
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:46.680]  Now all available at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year
[02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:49.360]  and make 2015 a true success.
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:53.880]  That's infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:53.880 --> 02:31:00.840]  2015 is the year to do it, and it all starts at infowarslife.com.
[02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:06.200]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:07.960]  toxic each and every day.
[02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:10.280]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:14.360]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:15.560]  than even outdoor air.
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:20.320]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:21.320]  homes.
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.160]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:28.160]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:31.640]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:32.640]  to as well.
[02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:36.800]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:41.800]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:47.080]  back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:51.480]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:53.560]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:53.560 --> 02:32:01.760]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:02.760]  In the near future.

[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:14.400]  Security, analysis, InfoWars building independent media operations.
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.400]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.200]  Prime Directed, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.720]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:28.040]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:30.280]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:34.720]  These people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:36.720]  They are never going to stop.
[02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:40.600]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:23.800]  We're going to go back to our guest.
[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:26.400]  Talk about the next big events that he sees coming.
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:29.120]  He's had really great history of being extremely accurate.
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:30.120]  I'm listening carefully.
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.120]  I know you are.
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:32.320]  Harry Dent is our guest.

[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.960]  value out there and cuts out the most garbage.
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:14.400]  Everybody should be filtering their water for cooking and for drinking with all the distillates
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:18.760]  and garbage that's in the water table, especially with fast growing cells.
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.040]  If you have children, look at the cancer rates going up and things, so much of it's in the

[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:22.800]  Going back to Mr. Dent, I want to give you the floor for the next 5, 10 minutes before
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:28.920]  we go to calls and those questions to you've accurately with these charts with demographics
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:30.600]  predicted so much that's happened.
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:33.480]  Tell us past China what else you're concerned about.
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:35.000]  Is it Germany in the EU?
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.840]  I don't understand these ideas out of the State Department and I've had famous spies
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.200]  on folks that are involved trying to destabilize Russia.
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:48.720]  They seem to believe that if we implode Russia and implode Asia that somehow that makes our
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:49.720]  economy better.
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.560]  Sure it makes people buy our bonds, but if there's no economy what's how is that going
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.440]  to matter from all the economics I've studied when you have global problems and that then
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:06.680]  compounds our problems, is it good for select corporations is why they want destabilization
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:08.440]  or what's happening there?
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:15.960]  Yeah, no obviously it's not good for major countries whether it be China, Russia, much
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.760]  of Europe to implode I mean we all trade with each other this is a global economy and has
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:25.760]  been increasingly for the last 100 years really for the first time to that extent in history
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.720]  so it's not good.
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:32.440]  It can be good long term you know I mean it's like right now Saudi Arabia wants oil prices
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:37.360]  to go down they want to knock out the frackers they want to knock out marginal oil producers
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:42.680]  like Venezuela, Iran and Iraq so it makes their market share better long term that's
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:48.440]  what Rockefeller did in the early 1900s with standard oil so yeah it does benefit some
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:55.440]  of these challenges do benefit certain countries longer term or company but it does not it
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:59.720]  is not good for the economy near term to have any major country go down and you're right
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:06.640]  I am we called Japan in 1988-89 we said Japan is going to crash while the rest of the world
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:12.400]  sees the greatest boom in history in the 90s nobody saw that combination event a few people
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:17.520]  saw the boom of the 90s very few and nobody saw the collapse of Japan we're saying the
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:22.520]  same thing about China China's the next Japan they've had a government driven over investment
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:27.840]  thing and they're going to clap but Germany of all the countries in the world in the next
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:35.400]  eight years from 2014 to 2022 has the steepest slide in demographic spending trends I have
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.800]  ever seen ever worse than Japan in the 90s now the world is looking to Germany to hold
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:48.040]  up the European Union just as Greece surprise surprise is looking at defaulting or renegotiating
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:49.040]  on their debt.
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:53.880]  Replacing the Germans just interrupt replacing the Germans with unskilled third world labor
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:59.880]  is not going to stop that demographic cliff no no it's not well here I mean remember
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:04.240]  I said earlier it's the emerging world which actually does have good demographic trends
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:09.520]  for coming decades except for China it's the emerging world is getting crucified by the
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:15.920]  fall in commodity prices because most emerging countries are commodity producers and exporters
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:22.760]  so the the emerging markets countries are down 30% and while while we're hitting new
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:27.840]  highs in our stock market and Germany's hitting new highs recently so so they're already under
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:32.120]  performing if the world implodes they're going to they're going to underperform even more
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.520]  because they're dependent on us they are not nearly as wealthy as people don't realize
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:42.840]  China has you know one-tenth the dollar level standard of living we do in one-fifth if you
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.640]  adjust for purchasing power so where do you expect this is a bold challenge where do you
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:52.960]  expect the Dow the S&P where do you expect the major stock market indexes to be 12 months
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:53.960]  from now.
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.840]  Okay well you know I've got a chart that shows that since the correction in 2011 the only
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:03.920]  substantial correction in this bubble boom here recently is that that we're going in
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:09.960]  a channel up and and and we have a key turning point we're looking at in our cycles mid to
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:17.560]  late March the likelihood is stocks will continue to edge up and it to about 2175 in this chart
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:22.880]  where we break above maybe 2300 but that's that's 19 to 20,000 in the Dow think of that
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:28.280]  term that's as high as we see things going if it gets there and then when it falls we
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:34.360]  have a broader pattern of higher highs and in the bubble booms 2000 peak 2007 peak and
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:43.720]  now 2014 or early 2015 the next new low is likely to be around by 5500 to 6000 on the
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:50.240]  Dow by late 2016 to early 2017 we're going to have a bigger crash than we saw in 2008
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:55.440]  early 2009 every bubble goes higher every crash goes lower because we're not solving
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:59.880]  the problem we have higher debt we have worse demographics ahead so how did we not have
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:04.280]  a worse crash so most economists thinking oh we just have a 20% correction this year
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:09.400]  and then we'll go on and on no we're not we're saying the market's likely to peak by mid
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:14.840]  to late March that the other scenario is that oil prices just keep plummeting although
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.720]  they're bouncing today but if they just keep plummeting down to 32 bucks in the next so
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:29.560]  many weeks or a couple months stocks could could basically fall start to fall now and
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:34.360]  in this channel we're talking about in this chart if stocks rate the S&P breaks below
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:40.440]  about 1870 which is not that far down just about 10% from the top this this bubbles over
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:44.640]  and it's going to burst more so I'm watching the oil price that's the key leading indicator
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:50.760]  my my preferred scenario out of all and in the short term I'm always guessing a long
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:54.360]  term we have very credible indicators but in the short term you have to guess I can't
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:59.240]  predict when a tsunami is going to hit Japan or Putin's going to invade Crimea all that's
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:04.600]  going to stop but you can look at patterns sure if you exclude wild cards the surest
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:08.920]  thing throughout history is demographics yeah that's the well that's the surest thing in
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:14.360]  the last century once we've had middle class economies which were a product of the free
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:18.760]  market capitalist system of innovation we didn't have a middle class you know before
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:23.320]  the you know after world war two and stuff you know we just had you know kings and peasants
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:28.240]  that's all we had for most of history so this is a big deal and when the average person
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:33.120]  makes a lot of income and has a lot of spending power it makes demographics more important
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:38.240]  than ever so yes you're right the economy here and in any country around the world
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:44.160]  that has any sort of somewhat free market capitalist democracy has followed demographic
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:48.880]  trends predictably it is the best indicator in the short term I can just look at okay
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:53.840]  here's the patterns here's this channel the likelihood is we're going to keep edging up
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:58.040]  because this market just wants to go up it's a market on crack I call it it's being fueled
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:02.640]  all this trillions of dollars of central banks it's not going into lending it's not going
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:07.360]  back to consumers or householders it's just going into speculation so the markets want
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:13.040]  to go up until something goes wrong in this oil well that's my next question is the high
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:20.400]  frequency trading the flash trading the manipulations the plunge protection team can that beat the
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:26.040]  demographic facts that were there previously can they bring us into a world of true false
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:34.320]  reality economic 1984 where the real economy is dead in a deflationary spiral but there's
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:39.680]  an inflation spiral in luxury goods in the future and the elite just get more and more
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:44.120]  separated from the public yeah well that that is what has been happening they have
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:48.520]  defeated demographics we would have gone into a great depression without ten trillion dollars
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:53.680]  of money printing from all the major central banks around the world they are fighting deflation
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.520]  they are fighting death 11 they don't want this to happen the problem is the tools they're
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:03.280]  using to fight it are creating another bubble in bubbles always burst we've always said
[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:06.920]  it's not going to be inflation that's going to be the problem because we're in a deflationary
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:11.600]  environment the problem is going to be central banks are going to create another even bigger
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:16.440]  bubble in real estate in stocks and everything else around the world and then that bubble
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:20.160]  is going to burst and guess who gets hurt the most when those bubbles burst the little
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:25.800]  guy rich people it's not the little the everyday person's already been crucified with okay so
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:29.440]  I'm wrong about that explain that to me then because that's interesting who get well I
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:34.240]  would say the nouveau rich the middle rich the insider elites they're going to make money
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:39.840]  on the rig market on the ups and downs like a casino from my lay view explain to me though
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:44.840]  who that rich group is that gets hurt the worst well yeah everybody talks about the top 20%
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.600]  that's the college educated affluent low and flying they're doing better than ever but
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:53.920]  you know the we I just did a report in my newsletter that it's not really 20 baby look
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:58.640]  at the top 20% the temperatures top 10% made most of those games you look at the top 10%
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:06.120]  the top 1% 110 of them made most of those games you look at the top 1% the top 0.1% one out
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:11.960]  of a thousand households made most of those games so so things are heavily skewed towards
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.800]  the very rich the problem with that Alex is they're very rich not only only yachts and
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:22.000]  private jets are going to be worthless and they own all these companies and all these
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:27.040]  financial assets that are over inflated the average person has maybe 3040 grand in stocks
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:31.720]  and some bonds and their 401k plan they get hurt when the economy goes down when jobs
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:38.880]  and wages aren't as good but the rich get crucified sure bubbles first the luxury economy
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:42.760]  is going to look like a highway sign that's been shot 20 times by hillbillies with 12
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:49.320]  gauges yeah it is dead just like practicing that the luxury economy is dead if you own
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:54.360]  a yacht sell it now you own a private jet sell it now you want a Ferrari sell it now
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:46:01.160]  you own a hundred million dollar dumbass condo in New York sell it now these people these
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:06.120]  things going to go down the worst in the 1930s real estate was not in a bubble in the roaring
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:10.040]  twenties it was stocks and it was farmland and tractor it was a tractor bubble do you
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:15.840]  want to really get down to it when the bubble burst new york went up five years after the
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:22.680]  main market in the 1929 old mark and it collapsed twice as much and didn't even come off the
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:27.600]  bottom sure sure let's say you know the average retiree out there you know has a million dollars
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:32.520]  in retirement funds let's say you know let's say some upper middle class person with some
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:37.760]  new bar ratios 20 million dollars in assets what if you had a hundred thousand dollars
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:41.120]  what would you do with it if you had ten million dollars what would you do with it if you had
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:43.880]  a hundred million dollars what would you do with it just briefly then we'll go to calls
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:50.440]  you know it's it's basically the same in 2008 what never happened before since the 1930s
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:56.800]  in a bubble burst in a deflationary era everything goes down except for cash the highest quality
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:02.680]  bonds like a ten-year treasury bond or a german boon you know everything goes down commodities
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:06.880]  went down gold went down silver went down real estate went down small cap stock large
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:13.200]  cap stock german stocks emerging company stocks country stock everything went down the safest
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:18.720]  thing is to be in cash or very safe bond and or if you're willing to take a little risk
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:24.160]  you go on the short side you maybe take 20% of your portfolio and short the S&P 500 or
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:29.280]  short the small cap index if you want to make some money but I think to me to most people
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:33.880]  I say look this is a bubble it's going to be violent just protect the gains you've made
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:38.600]  in real estate and stocks so it's like a hurricane you need to board up your house crash then
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:43.600]  you can buy so it's like a hurricane board up your house protect your assets emerge after
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:47.480]  that's where the sure profits are and here's the thing people don't get out that people
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:52.120]  say well I'm not making any money at zero or one or two percent you make money when
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:56.960]  everything falls and you can buy two three four five six times as much exactly property
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:01.840]  reasons you can buy that million dollar Ferrari for $60,000 you can buy that million dollar
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:08.320]  bus for $100,000 you can buy that five million dollar house for half a million dollars that's
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.520]  what happens in a depression that's what happens you have to have cash because nobody's going
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:18.160]  to lend you money when you see an opportunity if you don't have cash or cash flow you're
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.320]  not going to be able to take advantage of the greatest sale in our lifetime and mark
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:27.760]  my words and that's the greatest sale in our lifetime on financial assets of every type
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:33.600]  that's right let's go ahead and go in real estate folks it's going to be just plunging
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:42.960]  in my view LA from California you're on the air go ahead hey just I just wanted to say
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:51.120]  I respect both you guys but I think Mr. Dent's missing the picture on oil coming down being
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:59.440]  uh leading to a worse condition that's exactly what you must have misunderstood what I said
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:03.760]  I'm saying oil going down especially this rapidly is going to lead the worst conditions
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:08.960]  it's a sign that the global economy is slowing I mean I want to see what the caller said I kind
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:13.840]  of missed it are you saying you think Dent doesn't think oil going down is better you're
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:20.160]  thinking he thinks it's good what are you saying well I think that's missing missing the point uh
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.960]  yeah oil comes down it's going to be good in a lot of ways and bad in a lot of ways
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.600]  but let's take all out of the picture for a second uh there's supposed to be other
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:37.200]  technologies coming online I've I've seen them on uh news uh about generators that can use uh
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:44.320]  uh different things in a much better way uh that's got to be a good thing sure sure I mean new
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:48.800]  and new technologies could be wildcards the issue is they have to be scaled up even the
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:57.200]  quickest scaling takes what 10 years uh so no no no you're right Alex it he is right it is a good
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:03.600]  when you see inflation extremes or deflation extremes it is going to promote radical new
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:08.560]  innovations just like we got personal computers and cell phones out of the 70s and we got the
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:14.880]  jet engine and and radar and and the computer out of the 30s and 40s it will be good long term he's
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:19.600]  right about that but you're right it takes decades for this stuff to scale up and make a difference
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:24.640]  once it's invented a lot of alternative technologies are going to fail uh electric
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:31.600]  carls I wouldn't buy tesla at a dollar today um that's going to fail at oil prices or 10 20 dollars
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:38.640]  and and he's right though some more radical technologies will emerge that can compete at lower
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:44.080]  oil prices sure but that's 10 years down the road this continues la thank you a good point

[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:46.640]  our guest harry dent research dot com harry dent harry let's uh go back to the calls that that's a
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:50.960]  whole show we should do though about what will innovate the economy what could be done the problem
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:58.240]  is so many old power structures in crony capitalism use big government regulation that they actually
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:03.600]  finance to shut down the innovation is there any doubt that we'd already be much more advanced
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:08.240]  if it wasn't for the crony capitalist operations yeah no question i mean when i see the poorest
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.120]  countries in the world are the most corrupt the most crony capitalism the most government sponsored
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:17.840]  and run stuff and tribal leaders and stuff like that one of the cycles we study alex in addition
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:23.840]  to demographics and geopolitical and and and other things is an innovation cycle that comes about
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:29.680]  every 45 years you know it's kind of like the steam engine and then steam ships and then railroads
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:38.720]  and then autos and then computers literally every 45 years these things economy and create uh higher
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:44.080]  productivity and a better standard of living and then there's a break after those until you get the
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:50.560]  next and and we really the next big innovation cycle is going to be by our calculation 2032 to
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:56.240]  2055 it's a long way out we've already seen most of the benefits from the internet and personal
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:56:01.040]  computers and smartphones and cell phones and all in broadband and all this will move towards
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:08.720]  singularity accelerate and compress the cycles uh no i i i don't i don't think so i i think we're
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:14.480]  not going to see as much progress the new technology the caller earlier talking about
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:20.480]  innovation and energy nano technology can produce stuff out of nothing out of thin air but that is
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:25.600]  decades away from sure these new technologies are germinating right now and niche markets
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:30.960]  especially robotics biotech they're still not mainstream sure there's also a lot of fraud
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.280]  there it's going to take a while to suss out what's real john in california you're on the air go ahead
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:42.240]  congratulations harry you're about the only person that calls for dollar power when everybody
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:48.800]  including this show is saying dollar devaluation and dollar collapse going forward i heard you
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:55.280]  on another interview a couple years ago talk about what leaders needed to be elected in 2016
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:57:02.000]  we needed leadership to kind of lead us out of all of this failure in the past 10 15 years can you
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:07.440]  talk about what's going forward in the 2016 well you know i mean i'm not a political expert but
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:14.080]  these economic cycles obviously do affect politics right now the common knowledge just like it was
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:18.960]  in 2008 before the economy went down with oh hillary clinton's the favorite on the democratic side
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:24.880]  well she bombed and obama came out of nowhere and beat her it was it was a dark court same thing
[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:29.840]  jeb bush the establishment uh canada from the republican i don't think either of those are
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:35.600]  going to win in 2016 i think the economy is going to be very difficult and people are going to go
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:41.280]  for people who are saying we got to change stuff and but more effective than obama obama talk
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:47.120]  changed but he couldn't make change i think it will favor canada's more like elizabeth warn
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:53.840]  on the democratic side or uh chris christy on the republican side chris christy is the type of guy i
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:59.120]  know he's got this kind of tony soprano image but he's the type of guy that will tackle a problem
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:03.120]  and deal with it that's what we're not doing we're not tackling this death problem yeah you
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:07.120]  like him because he's a little more free market i just can't stand his democratic leanings when it
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:10.560]  comes to guns but i hear what you're saying call her just to be clear we've had guests on here with
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:14.960]  a lot of different ideas i believe the dollar will implode down the road but it'll be the last
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:19.120]  to implode it's like helter skelter i'm coming down fast but i'm miles above you they're all
[02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:24.320]  racing to devalue so that sends people back into the dollar but the dollar down the road i mean i'm
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:31.680]  not an expert like mr dent i think it's gonna collapse or something in 20 seconds long term
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:37.920]  is the dollar stable mr dent no no i agree with you i see the dollar going up in this crisis it's
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:43.680]  the best house in a bad neighborhood and deflation favors us down the roads we will never be the
[02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:48.240]  leader we were after world war two or let's come back in one minute and finish that statement

[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:27.440]  front lines if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance i'm just having some fun
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:32.480]  i'm trolling the trolls it's up on twitter at real alex jones retweet it alex jones retirement
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:40.000]  announced i'm not retiring it's a joke uh harry dent uh is our guest a final quick little segment
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:45.280]  with him finishing up with some callers uh but i totally agree with what he's saying the dollar
[03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:50.800]  is the best house in a bad neighborhood and yeah chances are it'll end up being dominant at the end
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:55.280]  but then it'll go under it's kind of like being on an island as the seawater raises you're still
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:00:59.600]  the last guy standing but if you don't have a boat you're in deep trouble knowing about the crises
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:05.040]  that are coming and making preparation to then come out better on the other side that's what
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:10.320]  protects you in my view tony and nevada quick question or comment for our guests go ahead hey
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:16.960]  how you doing um yeah i i'm of the belief that dropping gas prices uh is happening to further
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:22.080]  along the masses to sleep you know by eliminating one of life's daily stresses and i also understand
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:27.760]  the middle east desire to stop the fracking industry here in the u.s as it seems we very well
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:31.680]  could be or would have been energy independent very soon yeah we were the number one producer in the
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:37.440]  world right but what i don't understand is what the loss of jobs in the industry collapse that will
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:41.600]  certainly come from devastating the fracking industry all the investors and all the people
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:45.520]  that's going to adversely affect and we're talking multi millions of people and probably
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:50.640]  trillions of investment dollars do the globalist believe that the uproar this will create will
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:56.960]  somehow be balanced by the public sedation that's certainly going to occur as gas prices approach
[03:01:56.960 --> 03:02:02.160]  a dollar a gallon again and is this another shoot them in the back while you're smiling to their face
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:09.520]  situation occurring well yeah it's just another thing that says oh everything's okay it's not this
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:16.640]  is a sign this falling oil prices is a sign of slowing global demographics excessive debt over
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:21.680]  production of everything we overexpand it when you have too much debt when you're two to three times
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:27.840]  economy you're going to overexpand over consume and have excess capacity and that takes deflation
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:34.160]  to to to wash it out and you know Alex told me earlier all this corruption and crony capitalism
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:40.160]  and lobbying all of this stuff's going to be hit by this collapse so this is good thing long term
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:47.280]  lower oil prices lower home prices are good long term but when they reset and collapse all the debt
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:52.960]  behind them goes under and the industry's behind them go under and it's going to cause care sure
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:58.880]  saying here is how do you survive this chaos to get to the other side when all these trends do
[03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:03.600]  cause greater and that's what your book at harry dent dot com breaks down folks should get the
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:08.640]  demographic cliff and read it or they're they're crazy in my view it's just invaluable information
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:12.640]  and has been being proven right again and again thank you caller a last caller we have time for
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:18.480]  i'm sorry the others uh tam in florida quick question or comment yes i just want to ask
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:23.600]  mr jen if you could point out some of the dominoes that will fall i see the gas thing the same way
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:28.480]  that you guys do too good to be true and it's just going to be more problems later down the road but
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:34.320]  can you point out some more of the the signs to look for and also how the bricks nations will
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:39.760]  fall into all this well yeah we talked about demographics getting worse in the united states
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:44.400]  in the coming years and in most countries especially in germany and southern europe which
[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:50.480]  is already in trouble but the bigger picture we've been painting against most even other crisis kind
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:57.520]  of people is that this emerging world thing the commodities keep collapsing and that hurts the
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:02.240]  emerging world the emerging world is the only part of the world that has good demographics
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:08.000]  going forward with younger populations but if commodity prices go down that's where they make
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:13.680]  their money that's where their best jobs and companies and banks and finance then come from
[03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:19.120]  and and when we look at the emerging countries they correlate more their stock markets correlate more
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:25.920]  with commodity prices than with us or european stock prices so we're we're saying this this
[03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:31.760]  fall in commodity prices is part of the crisis it's going to get worse sure and in closing the
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:37.200]  Saudis and others saw russia and us producers driving it down naturally so they're just violently
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:41.440]  trying to ride away they already know it's going down i think you try to knock out competition to
[03:04:41.440 --> 03:04:46.400]  artificially bring it up higher later but again exploration new technologies i don't think that's
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:50.640]  going to help them it's going to be interesting to see mr dent congratulations on your predictions
[03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:55.520]  coming true we'll talk to you again soon thanks for the time okay thank you alan powerful interview
