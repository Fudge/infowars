[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome! Here we are, it is the 6th day of June 2007. We're
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.280]  going to be live for the next three hours. Senator Sessions has finally gotten a copy
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.880]  of a complete bill. It's even semi-secret from high-ranking Senators. It is total absolute
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.320]  mega amnesty, the worst ever, even worse than we thought from the subsections that we've
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.880]  gotten. We'll be going over the 20 total loopholes, the end of America, in the second hour. In
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.880]  the first hour, Matt Lepacek reporting for InfoWars.com and WeAreChange.org with Luke
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.680]  Radowski and Michael Nar. We're at the Republican debates last night in New Hampshire in the
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.000]  big media gymnasium area, separate from the debates. They went in, said who they were
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.760]  with, got CNN press passes, they were letting small newspapers, TV stations, all over the
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.640]  country, didn't matter, big tent. They went in and they asked serious follow-up questions
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.720]  to Rudolph Giuliani's minions about the two separate times in the last two weeks where
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.120]  they confronted him in New York and surrounding areas, politely as well, asking him about
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.000]  his comments that he was told Tower 1 and 2 were going to fall. He then denied it. We
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.120]  have played, of course, the national television program Giuliani was on with the now, of course,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.160]  deceased anchor of ABC News, Peter Jennings. He also said it in front of the 9-11 commission.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.080]  And his head pollster said, no, it's a lie, you don't have any documentation. And then
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.000]  the press secretary was there in the crowd and ran off. We have this from eyewitnesses
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.560]  and I was watching the live video cam feed. It's not on the main video feed that's out
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.600]  there on the web. And they went and got the police and the state police came in and arrested
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.600]  Matt Lepasig and charged him with criminal trespass, ladies and gentlemen, which depending
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.040]  on how they apply, it could be a felony or a misdemeanor. He has since now gotten out
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.600]  of jail in the early morning hours. It was historical because they had wireless internet
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.960]  via a cell phone hooked up to the laptop and when they took his camera away and unplugged
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.520]  he still had the audio separately hooked into the laptop. That went out for about five minutes
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.720]  in the squad car. The only question is, were we able to save it? I was watching it at home
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.000]  as it happened. It was cutting in and out because of buffering issues. So many people
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.840]  trying to watch it, which we were worried about. But for other people it wasn't buffering.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.360]  They were able to see it. So I saw a lot of this live from the camera that he was holding
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.080]  in his hand, one of the Infowars cameras that we donated. Just absolutely amazing.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.600]  We have Matt Lepasig with us. When we get back in the second segment we're going straight
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.600]  to him. It is on the front page of the Drudge Report. It is on the front page of Digg. It
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.920]  has gotten massive attention. Go to PrisonPlanet.com. Go to JonesReport.com. We stayed up here until
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.320]  two in the morning writing this article and expanding it and putting it out last night
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.440]  about the incredible tyranny that everyone is witnessing. I haven't discovered who put
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.320]  the video up on the web yet. I was thinking it would take until today to get somebody
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.320]  with all these cameras to get the video up. Somebody uploaded it and it is up on the Drudge
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.760]  Report all over the place right now. So we're going to be breaking all this down coming
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.760]  up in the next segment. This is huge news. We also have Ron Paul's campaign popping in.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.920]  At the first debate, and this has been timed out, one candidate got 16 minutes when another
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.440]  candidate only got five and a half. Last night it was the same thing. The first half of the
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.240]  debate was just three of the ten people. These are staged debates. This has never happened
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.240]  before. That's huge news. We've got open talk of strikes on Iran, wall-to-wall bedlam.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.520]  We'll be right back with Matt Lepacek, Luke Rudowski, and the rest of the We Are Change
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.520]  M4Wars.com team.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.520]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.560]  Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.920]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.080]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.960]  were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.760]  us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.200]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.120]  guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.640]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get

[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.520]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.400]  methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.440]  the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.440]  entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed

[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.600]  This is Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.000]  We've got the Ron Paul campaign popping in today in the aftermath of another staged debate
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.720]  that he still won in every major poll. I've looked and it's got to be more than 20, including
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.240]  the CNN poll. He's winning right now at 56 percent. It is Wednesday, the sixth day of
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.160]  June 2007. Senator Sessions released his list of 20 loopholes in the Senate immigration
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:00.200]  bill. Huge news. It's worse than we even thought. It's worse than I even reported. You know,
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.440]  I get accused all the time of exaggerating. No, I do my homework. We happen to know how
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.440]  dire the straits are. Frankly, in almost every case, I underestimate or I underreport. Okay?
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.480]  Truth is stranger than fiction. So that's coming up. Let me just read part of this article
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.440]  and then we're going to go to him. Reported arrest on orders of Giuliani press secretary.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.640]  Now again, we know that his head press people were there. They were Matt Lepesek and others,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.200]  Luke Radowski and others were questioning and even mainline media was going, those are
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.080]  good questions and we're bringing up Ron Paul to him first. They of course then accused
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:45.080]  some older gentleman who was with a major publication of being with our people. If anybody
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.440]  brought up Ron Paul, they got mad. This went on and on and on and on. I was watching it
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.440]  on the live link at WeAreChange.org. I'd get to watch a minute and then it would cut
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.460]  out for a minute because so many people were hitting it. But reporter arrested on orders
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.440]  of Giuliani and then Matt Lepesek says, you know, we've questioned Giuliani twice in the
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.360]  last few weeks. He says he didn't say that the towers, that he got word that they were
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.160]  going to fall before they did, but he told Peter Jennings, he told C-SPAN, we're going
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160]  to play this audio later after our guests are gone, but it's up on PrisonPlanet.com
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.160]  right now if you want to see it. And then he says back off and starts walking away.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.240]  But they were just asking him the questions and by then his people had already scurried
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.400]  off to get the state police. They came over and grabbed Luke, grabbed Matt, grabbed some
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.280]  other people, drug them outside. Now Matt, I talked to people that were in the line with
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.600]  Matt when he went up and said who he was with and they gave them CNN press passes.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.960]  Everybody got those. It took special passers to get into the debate hall. This was outside
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.400]  at an auditorium across the street. This was a big facility with hundreds and hundreds
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.900]  of reporters. This is a big overflow. I mean, if you were writing for the local five and
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.600]  dime you could get in. You know, the local green sheet. Anybody who said they were media
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:12.600]  got in. They got CNN press passes and they ran up to him and CNN, to their credit, went
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.880]  outside and said don't arrest Luke, don't arrest Matt, don't arrest these people. We
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.000]  issued press passes. And the state police said we don't care. The complaint was made
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.040]  by Giuliani's people. He's going to jail. We're putting charges on him. Now they've
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.520]  gotten so cavalier about these false charges. They then went on to say we may charge you
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.420]  with espionage. We may charge you for having a hidden camera. Nothing hidden about it.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.760]  They have the microphone in their hand. They have another handheld camera and they have
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.680]  the other camera as backup to the laptop. He's up there in their face saying we're transmitting
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.960]  this live over the internet. There's other live cameras there for national television.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.320]  It's a building filled with hundreds. I mean, there probably was 500 press there. Just giant
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.240]  throngs. This is the Republican debates. The third in New Hampshire. The key battleground
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:09.240]  state. All of this is going on. And then the sickest thing on Digg and on my message
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.480]  board and on 9-11 blogger, I was looking and there are people on there saying good, arrest
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.720]  them all. I'm sick of these 9-11 truthers. They deserve it. Alex Jones deserves to be
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.200]  arrested. Talking about when I asked Bush a question and he had me arrested. It almost
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.960]  broke my arm off. The state police did. I mean, this is the new America. Alright, I'm
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.440]  going to shut up and go to Matt Lepacek. They didn't charge him with espionage as if he
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:41.440]  worked for a foreign government. No, he works for the American people. And they told him
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.560]  that we could charge you for having a hidden camera. No, that's if you had a hidden camera
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.960]  in a bathroom or a hidden camera in somebody's house or a hidden camera that isn't in a public
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.360]  place, okay? I've read the laws, federal and state and international as well and let me
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.800]  just give it to you. If you're in an area which does not have a reasonable expectation
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:08.800]  of privacy, those laws don't apply, you lying pieces of trash. You don't go to a football
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.560]  game and say if somebody's got a camera and you're not allowed to tape them. You don't
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.720]  go to a gigantic press circus with huge TV cameras everywhere and say you're not allowed
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.600]  to videotape me. And all over the nation, I've had cops walk up to me and say you're
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.880]  not allowed to tape me. That's eavesdropping. I'm going to arrest you. I go go ahead. It's
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.840]  First Amendment. I'm going to sue you. You may beat the rep. You're not going to beat
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.560]  the ride, pal. And I'm going to sue them. And they know it. They look right in my eyes
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:43.300]  and they decide I'm going to leave this person alone. And I watched this big state trooper
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.200]  shoving them down. They were physically attacked, Luke and Matt. It was supposedly even worse
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.760]  once they got outside. This big thug in his Marine Corps drill sergeant hat. They love
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.840]  killing America. They love hating this country. They love shoving us around and working for
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.040]  the New World Order. They enjoy it. And don't think for a minute they won't man the FEMA
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.640]  camps. Don't think for a minute they won't come and take your guns. Don't think for a
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.120]  minute they don't want to play Jack Bauer on you and your family. All right, Matt Lepacek,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.840]  thank you for coming on with us, sir. By the way, let's call Ron Paul's press secretary
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.920]  and let's see if we can get him on at about 40 after to the 30 after so I have time, but
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.960]  these guys have not. I'll just hold them for five minutes when their guy comes on and hold
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.840]  them in the next hour. Matt Lepacek, thanks for coming on with us. Hello, Super Patriot
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.040]  Alex Jones, how are you doing, sir? No, you are the Super Patriot and you guys are on
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:38.040]  just an absolute rampage of liberty and freedom engaging these people. Al Gore, John Edwards,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.520]  Rudy Giuliani twice, Hillary Clinton, one of our reporters just two days ago got physically
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.660]  assaulted and thrown out for asking Hillary a question. We haven't done a report on that.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.380]  You guys have done so much. David Rockefeller confronted police walking up to you guys and
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.660]  saying we're going to say you got bombs on you if you don't leave and stop protesting
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:03.620]  at Ground Zero. Open frame ups, total wickedness, all on video. You are incredible, but listen,
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.940]  I'm excited. I'm going to try to shut up. Describe exactly what happened last night
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.660]  because obviously your eyes and ears and then other people that witness things can describe
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.220]  it even better than the video, which is riveting. All right, I'm trying to bear with me here.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.500]  We're going on a tad bit of sleep. We had a four hour trip back here from New Hampshire
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:24.420]  yesterday evening, but here we go. As you said earlier, we were there. We had CNN press
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:30.140]  pass, CNN credentials. We went to the press pass office. We spoke to the woman in person
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.820]  on the Sunday when we were there for a democratic debate and we received contacts. We then laid
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.820]  our contact of that person on the Tuesday morning and secured our press passes. Went
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.460]  down to CNN, went down to, I think it was St., I forget the name of the college over
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.340]  there, St. Anselm College where they were holding the debates over there and what they
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.340]  call Manchester, New Hampshire, which is really Goffstown, New Hampshire. Anyhow, we're inside
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:04.980]  the spin room as they appropriately have named it. We're waiting around. We've got Sam and
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.740]  we've got Jason Bermas and a couple other guys out there, the Loose Change people, Luke
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.020]  Podolsky, myself. We've got our guys, Mike Gnarr, we've got Amir and Brian and Oscar
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.540]  and a whole bunch of other guys sitting in the Truth Mobile One over there in the RV
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:27.540]  that we had taken up there with us. We were inside waiting around and all of a sudden
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.940]  we were expecting the candidates to come out. Now, we had been there over there on Sunday
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.300]  covering the Democratic debates and we've got some excellent footage on that, which
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.340]  I don't know if you guys have talked about yet, but we were aware that the big candidates
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.880]  aren't really coming into the spin room. They're either being flown immediately out or they're
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.780]  going to their private parties. We had actually RSVP'd that evening for Rudy Giuliani's party.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.080]  We didn't have an opportunity to make it over there, as it seems. We were well prepared
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:02.080]  for the event that the main candidates, Giuliani and some of the other front runners over there
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.100]  around the... We're not going to actually... And let's get into what actually happened
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.460]  to you and when they took you to jail. I heard you were pretty concerned when you got your
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:16.580]  one phone call out to the guys at Truth One, back to the RV, that they were talking about
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.580]  moving you, other charges. Let's get into it. Okay. So basically, we have the representatives
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.140]  come out there. I don't even know his name. He represented Rudy Giuliani. Two or three
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.380]  questions get asked. The question right before me was Sam Attero. It's his pollster. It's
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.940]  his national pollster. But his press secretary was there in the crowd. We've got witnesses
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.060]  that ran off and made the report, or it was his acting press secretary. But go ahead.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.500]  Well, there was a question that there was prior to mine, which I can't even recount.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.900]  You have to look at the video to see it. They spun it and they would not answer the question.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.300]  We were interjecting saying, sir, please answer the question. All of a sudden, here it is,
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.900]  my opportunity. The guy's looking at me directly in the face. We say the same thing, which
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.580]  you guys keep hearing, the same question. We confronted him on Tuesday at Seashore Restaurant
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.060]  on ABC video with an interview with Peter Jennings. Giuliani admitted that the World
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.380]  Trade Center said he had foreknowledge they were going to collapse. Then that Tuesday
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.500]  morning when we went there at Seashore Restaurant, he told us that he never made such a statement
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.340]  and that he did not have foreknowledge. The gentleman said that, you know, I would like
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.460]  to see that video or some of the facts. And I said, sir, I have a notebook right here
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.220]  in my bag. If you'd like, we can go sit down and take a look at it right now. He was acknowledging
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.100]  me to the fact that you're watching this stuff. And then he yells back off and you
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.180]  start backing off and the police come and arrest you. Indeed. And I can't even recount
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.220]  because I haven't watched the video myself. And of course he says back off and you see
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.340]  his people run. They're behind him. You can see them suddenly move away. They run and
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.700]  go, oh my God, it's one of them. And the state police, big old guy comes over and just, because
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.900]  you're a pretty tall guy yourself, and just right pushes you, get out of here, boy. Yeah,
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.380]  they were warning me in advance. They were saying, oh, that's enough, that's enough.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.020]  And all we're doing is we're pressing the question because he's still engaging us. Okay.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.260]  We were in the middle of engaging a question when I had gentlemen put their hands on me,
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.060]  three of them, and dragged me out. And I was later told that Luke Brudowski, which later
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.700]  said, hey, what are you doing? He didn't do anything. He was later dragged out by Mirror
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.220]  Association. So it was a wink and a nod. It happened for the press secretary. And that's
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.220]  when I was outside and I tried to clarify, who kicked me out? If it was CNN.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.620]  And let me explain law. I have it in front of me. We actually pulled up New Hampshire
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.180]  law. We pulled up the code. I have it here in front of me. It's the same as Texas or
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.340]  any other state. Trespass, you know, just negligent trespass is an accident. But then
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:35.300]  you just have other types of trespass, like criminal trespasses, knowingly doing it, knowingly.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.760]  This is a public event. You get your trespasses to it. And it's a spontaneous deal. They say
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.140]  throw you out. So the cops go ahead and put some charges on you. There has to be a complainant.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.980]  Then you have to be warned to leave if you were first invited. And then if you don't
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.580]  leave, they can get you on trespass. They didn't do this. Those police are criminals.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:01.300]  And I call for their indictment on official oppression. I want them arrested. They are
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:08.980]  enemies of the republic. They are treasonous demons. They are enemies of the very soul
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.220]  of this republic. And all of our veterans, all of our founding fathers are spinning in
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.820]  their graves. Stay with me, Matt.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.340]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.700]  despise imperialistic policy of US. Loss of confidence causing more selling. GAO is warning

[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.300]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the mark of the beast. Soon
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.100]  it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise. The world is pressing toward a forced one
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.060]  world religion. The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.700]  our first amendment. Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.620]  what the new world religious leaders prescribe. In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.980]  Act which goes into effect May 11, 2008. Many people believe that this will be the mark
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.660]  of the beast because of the restrictive measures included which seems to parallel the no buying
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:58.440]  and selling of Revelations 1317. In Revelations 14.9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.700]  says if any man worship the beast, take notice. It says worship the beast. This issue is about
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.480]  worship not economics. For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive

[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.800]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer. But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.160]  great. For a while anyway. Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.600]  quickly. Listen, haven't you heard about calxointment? I use it regularly on my heels and they stay
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.040]  looking great and my feet feel as good as they look. What's the name again? Wait, I'm
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:48.840]  getting my pen out. It's calx, C-A-L-L-E-X. What makes calxointment so different? It's
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.220]  got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry cracked feet and leave your feet feeling
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:23:00.560]  soft and smooth just like a baby's bottom. For soft silky feet that look great in sandals,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.580]  use enzyme rich moisturizing calxointment. It's diabetic friendly and found in the foot
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.220]  care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B Grocery Stores,
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.700]  Medicine Shop Pharmacies and Rite Aid. Hey, there's a drug store. I'll be right back.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.700]  I'm getting some calx. Federal agents, we are armed!
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:41.580]  I see a message from the government like everybody else.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:11.580]  I know we're crazed. I know you see a lot of energy in us and we seem like maniacs.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:19.580]  We should respond with anger and force and energy to total corruption, our country being
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:27.580]  overrun, criminal police everywhere feeding on everyone. Let's go back to Matt who was
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:37.180]  literally kidnapped by the state police and taken to jail. Matt, what happened to you?
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:44.860]  What happened to you? What happened to you? What happened to you? What happened to you?
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.740]  Who was literally kidnapped by the state police and taken to jail? Matt, what happened
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.340]  once they grabbed you? Describe it blow by blow for us. Then we're going to get Luke
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.540]  Radowski and others. I'm going to keep you guys on into the next hour. This is so important.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.500]  We're going to have Ron Paul. People pop in in just a moment for a few minutes first.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.500]  But go ahead.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.940]  Speed along here if I go too slowly because I'm going to play right this time.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.660]  I understand you basically had no sleep. You're exhausted. Just turbo up and tell the story.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.260]  Okay. So basically we're asking the question and all of a sudden I got people behind me
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:20.220]  and they grabbed me, turned me around. I have my hand. They are holding on to my body forcing
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.620]  me forward. I'm walking along with them. I'm making statements publicly making sure not
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:30.660]  to scream but to say loudly and calmly I'm being escorted out of this premises for asking
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:37.660]  Rudy Giuliani a question. Making similar declarations such as that. Going all the way outside the
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.700]  officers finally take me to the staircase while I'm escorted out of the building and
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:49.700]  they let me go. They said you have to leave. I said for the most part under whose authority
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.820]  am I being forced to leave? Now you can watch the video to see exactly what I said.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.940]  So you weren't supposed to talk to the gods. That's them claiming then that it was trespass.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:05.220]  Well no. What actually happened here is that I asked them on whose authority here is my
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.980]  trespass voided? Is it just because of your discretion that you decided to remove me?
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.980]  I have a trespass. A trespass is not voided and it's your discretion of what you're choosing
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.980]  to do. But now talking back in Soviet America sends you to the gulag.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:23.900]  Trespassing, exactly. So I say to them you're not providing any information here. If I walk
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.780]  past you right now is that mean I'm going to get arrested? And I say okay sir I'm going
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.100]  to walk past you. And sure enough I get arrested and they say this is what you wanted, this
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.340]  is what you wanted. Is that what I wanted? I wanted clarification. I wanted to stand up
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.380]  for my rights and know what the heck is going on.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.340]  They've already put us in free speech zones. They've already restricted us. They're doing
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.740]  all this criminal stuff. You've got an official trespass. Then Luke told me that at that point
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.540]  CNN got involved and said no, please don't arrest them. What happened then?
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.900]  Yes, I heard someone from CNN getting the police officer's attention. I don't know exactly
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.260]  what they said. But nevertheless then I was escorted away.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.340]  That's because they know they're liable. You didn't do anything and they gave you those
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.140]  passes. You were unbelievable.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.340]  Handcuffs right there on the front gates. They're saying this is something that I wanted.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.900]  Did anybody get footage of the handcuffing?
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.900]  I'm not entirely certain. We haven't reviewed any of the footage yet.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:21.900]  Now I've seen scores of posts who heard the audio once they ripped the camera off of you.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.340]  My internet cut out, but if mine's buffering, other people's wasn't. And I've seen it and
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.100]  basically from all these angles that the audio continued out in the parking lot where they
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:35.860]  were saying hey boy this is what you wanted, do you like it? And then comments in the squad
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.980]  car. That was recorded on the laptop, correct? Have you gotten that back?
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.100]  You know the information actually in order to make the battery last as long as possible,
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.620]  we're not doing client-side recording on that notebook. I'm going to be contacting the encoders
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.420]  today, camera streams, to see if they can provide it with that.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.020]  We've got to buy you a bigger battery pack or something. We've got to get you better
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.220]  gear.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.460]  We've got all kinds of stuff we need to get over here, you know.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.940]  Well here's the next question. Well we're going to help you out and I'm going to help
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.140]  you with your defense too. I'm told one of the cameras got damaged. Do I need to send
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.860]  you two more cameras?
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.340]  Well not only did it get damaged, the camera was dropped. I didn't see this but several
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:16.300]  people told me it was stepped on. And the camera right now is inoperable.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.300]  They broke one of the soundings I sent.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.020]  Yeah it just so happened to hit the ground.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.860]  We're going to send you two more for that one. Just like they broke into your thing
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.580]  and stole your famous 9-11 inside job sign you've had for four years. We're going to
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.260]  send you, and then you made two, you made two of those signs. We're going to send you
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.500]  two more cameras. How does that sound?
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.380]  You know whatever else we can do. I would like to have those people standing up doing
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.580]  the same thing, going out there. That's what we want. More than money, more than donations,
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.540]  more than anything we could possibly do in order to change the world. We need numbers
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.580]  and just strengthen numbers. That's what they're afraid of. They're afraid of our unity. You
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.540]  know they can take our heart beat but they can't take our soul, you know.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:57.020]  That's right and they are afraid of your energy. They're afraid of your will, on your mission.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.080]  They're scared. Their whole police state, the whole tracking grid is because they're
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.280]  afraid of citizens engaging them. That's what this is all about. They are scared.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.720]  These thugs are scared.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:15.600]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.280]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water. A world in which our produce is
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.720]  grown naturally without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals. But the truth is
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.200]  we don't live in such a world. These toxins enter our bodies and the organ in our body that
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.920]  works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.960]  important organs in the human body. With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the

[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.240]  Government is best which governs least. Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.360]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.640]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:34.160]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have

[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.280]  In the coming days, we're going to analyze this whole thing because it's so important.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.000]  We've got emails and calls pouring in from people who did shoot video in the parking lot at the
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.560]  gates. Other people inside, they're going to be uploading it to YouTube and Google video.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:54.240]  Also want to get the students for 9-11 Truth on who shot some of the video to get their perspective
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.480]  on what happened. That is in the big green room area where all the media was let in,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:08.000]  just asking Giuliani's minions a question about some of his statements. They ordered the state
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.840]  police to come in and throw him out and arrest him. We're going to go back to Matt Lepacek and
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.400]  Luke Radowski and others that have gotten back to New York, drove back overnight here in about 10
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.000]  minutes. But right now, Jesse Benton, press secretary, press coordinator for Congressman
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.680]  Ron Paul's presidential run for the presidency about the debate. He's won every major poll,
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.880]  but yet again, Jesse said he hoped yesterday he'd be given equal time. Ron Paul was literally stuck
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.480]  on the end in the shadows. One of my writers, Aaron Dykes, left at about three in the morning
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.880]  last night, but today he's going to time it all out. But in past debates, we've seen 16-minute
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.840]  to five-minute ratios. It may even be worse this time. It appears that three candidates were given
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.800]  about 60 plus percent of the time. These are rigged debates. I know you guys don't want to
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.320]  sound like sore losers because you won anyways as underdogs, but it needs to be stated that even in
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:08.800]  a rigged race, it's like a horse race where it's a 10-lap race and they let the other horses get
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:15.600]  five laps ahead. They turn Ron Paul loose and he ran circles around them and literally wins by five
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:22.240]  laps when he was five laps behind. This is untold. This is off the charts. Jesse Benton, thanks for
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:27.360]  coming on with us. Thanks for having me out. I appreciate it. I also want to get your take on
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:37.520]  one of the biggest Las Vegas groups that analyzes sports and they've been very accurate in every
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.960]  election. They're now saying that Ron Paul has a good chance of winning and it basically sounds
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.480]  like your analysis or my analysis about how he's the only Republican that can win against Hillary,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.520]  but I'm going to shove about that. Please get into the debate and your take on,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.600]  are you going to try to be a good sport and let them cheat? I'm not trying to be mean, Jesse.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.160]  You guys are just too good of sports when they're cheating out in the open and you see the ref being
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:09.760]  paid off $1,000 by Don Carleone, you know there's a problem. Well, I got to admit, I'm a little
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.960]  frustrated with the amount of coverage last night. This is unofficial because I haven't
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.360]  verified it yet, but I had one of my assistants back at the office, Michael Krackel, doing some
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:28.000]  analysis for me. By his calculations, Ron got eight questions and spoke for a total of six and a half
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.520]  minutes, whereas Rudy Giuliani got 14 questions and spoke for about 17 minutes. That's what we've
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:41.280]  got. Yeah, and that's a little frustrating. More so, right after the fact, Romney McCain
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:48.400]  and Giuliani all got immediate interviews with either Wolf Blitzer or Larry King. While CNN
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.560]  was pretty generous about offering Ron to come on their morning program today, which he couldn't do
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.920]  because of his flights, it's the after-debate interviews, we were a little frustrated we were
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.280]  shut out. Well, we've looked at the numbers. What is there about one-tenth of viewers on CNN Morning
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:10.800]  compared to a huge debate? Yeah, yeah. Look, we don't want to cry too much about this, and you
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.680]  know, we are still... Yeah, but you have to. You have to. Listen, you're winning from behind.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.480]  The American people are behind you. He's a populist constitutionalist. This is a major
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.520]  political realignment. They're panicking, so they literally, and I know lighting, I know cameras,
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.600]  they stuck him in the dark on the edge. They never cut to him. That was our calculation just
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.400]  watching it last night while I was busy dealing with a reporter being arrested, one of my reporters
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.840]  for no reason, literally. I was watching, and that's what the numbers we had was Giuliani around
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.720]  18, Ron Paul around six and a half. That means they got nearly triple the time of Ron Paul.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.440]  Now, by any stretch of the imagination, that's not fair, Jesse. And look, in past debates,
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.640]  it was always fair exactly. Each person got an exact amount of time. This is rigged,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.520]  and I think Ron Paul needs to speak out about it.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.600]  Well, you know, the mainstream media has always been behind the curve on these kind of things,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.400]  and they're behind the curve on picking up through grass fire support for Ron Paul.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.520]  You know, at the same time, I think that Ron did with his six minutes so much more than the other
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.840]  guys were able to do with triple their time. And you know what? I'm not so sure that giving these
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.760]  guys all this extra time is necessarily a great thing for them. You know, do the American people
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:34.400]  want to hear Rudy Giuliani go on and on about how we need to stay on the offense and continue to
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.760]  spend hundreds of billion dollars overseas in this bogus war on terror? Well, maybe they do,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.960]  because that's going to tell them that he shouldn't be our president.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.320]  Well, Jesse, that's key. He's not speaking to us, though, and a lot of top analysts have said this
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.000]  even after we made the point, and I'll only say that today. You know, we're not the only one
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.880]  seeing this. It's as if the Republicans are playing to the elite and to foreign lobbies,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.600]  and don't even care what the people want to hear. Giuliani knows it's incredibly unpopular,
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.520]  even with Republicans, this war now. He knows over 80% from 75 a few months ago are now against the
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:13.280]  war. He doesn't care. He said we need to forge our military into nation building. That means
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.040]  imperial troops. I mean, this guy's like Emperor Palpatine.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.880]  Oh, you heard him last night. He said that we need to train our United States Army to be a
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.960]  nation building force. That came out of his mouth last night, so it's pretty clear what he
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.160]  would do if he was president. And you know, I got to say, I am a Republican. I'm a diehard
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.560]  Republican, and I think that a Rudy Giuliani candidate, he would be a death nail for the
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.320]  Republican Party. We would see a Democratic big government majority become permanent if we run
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.200]  Rudy Giuliani. You see the shrinking of the Republican base, which is our dissatisfaction
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:55.440]  with the war and with police state nation building. And quite frankly, our base is shrinking
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.600]  because of the lack of conservative values and constitutional values. So Rudy Giuliani
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.000]  is a sure loser in the general election and would be a death nail. We are going to see a
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.640]  Democratic president with a Democratic House and Senate if that's where-
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.480]  By the way, that's what the top Las Vegas oddsmakers who, by the way, are almost never
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:25.040]  wrong. They're the most accurate we've seen. You ought to read this NFL bookmaker analysis. It says
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.600]  only Ron Paul can beat the Democrats. They've done the spreads. They've done the analysis.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.560]  And of course, they're betting on him. There is literal betting going on right now. So the media
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.480]  is telling you Ron Paul doesn't exist. They're saying they're cheating in the polls. They're
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:44.080]  saying these numbers don't fit with their analysis. Las Vegas is saying that Ron Paul
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.000]  is the strong underdog and that Ron Paul is the only person that can win the presidency
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.360]  from the Republican ticket. Exactly what I've been telling you people.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.920]  Stock to what they say, Alex, because that's free markets at work right there. They've got
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.720]  hundreds of millions of dollars riding on them being right and them being accurate in their
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.480]  predictions and their analysis, much more so than traditional pollsters. So I think we should
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.120]  listen to what they say and take what they say very seriously.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.360]  Oh, absolutely, because they're not there just putting out political announcements.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:26.800]  Their whole world is on being right. Their whole world is on getting it 19 times out of 20,
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.480]  literally, or they're out of business. And this is one of the top analysts out there,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.880]  especially on NFL, and they've done all the number spreads on this. Now,
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.120]  what's the strategy now? When is the next debate? How can we help Ron Paul?
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.800]  The next debate that we are officially in will be August the fifth. There's going to be a special
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.040]  edition of ABC's this week with George Stephanopoulos. So it's going to be Sunday morning,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:54.000]  August the fifth. The way to keep helping Ron Paul is to keep sending all the money that you
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.200]  can afford to. These things are expensive and we're doing well financially, but we need to
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.640]  start buying some media buys and producing some commercials. Also, we're going to continue to do
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.720]  as much as we can with the internet through our YouTube channel, I think is the most important
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:16.560]  thing. And just continue your online support with the blogs, with emailing reporters, with writing
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.400]  in to your local newspapers about Ron and about why you support him.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.440]  Jesse Minton, press secretary, the head of media operations for the presidential campaign for Ron
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.800]  Paul. Have you seen the Washington Post article admitting that Ron Paul is very strong?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.440]  Which article was that? I just saw one they wrote on our New Hampshire coordinator yesterday.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.040]  It's a brand new one. I know there's so much coming out, you can't keep track of it all
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.800]  because you're dealing with the media. But I mean, they are admitting that he is now
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.600]  what they're calling a very powerful dark horse.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.720]  Well, I think that's absolutely correct. I would say that we still have to wear the dark horse
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.800]  because, you know, because of our lack of access to tens of millions of dollars. But I think we are
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.120]  a powerful dark horse and I think we're knocking right on the door. And I think we've got some of
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:08.160]  the quote unquote top tier candidates pretty nervous. What type of coverage did the congressman
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.880]  get last night? Because I need the specifics as you were there, you were watching it all happen.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.600]  We went into the spin room, which is apparently where your gentleman had some trouble right
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.400]  outside of. But I went into the spin room and it's hard to tell, you know, because I try to
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.640]  collect cards from everyone that talks to Ron. There was a lot of alternative media, some general
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.320]  mainstream media, cameras, blogs, and he was probably getting the most attention of anybody
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.080]  in there. We were just kind of swamped by, engulfed in a circle of reporters. That was very good.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.680]  This morning he went on Judge Napolitano's radio show and then tonight he's going to be the lead
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:53.600]  on the Tucker Carlson show on MSNBC. He's got talking to some other major print reporters.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.080]  There's going to be a major New York Times article, New York Times magazine coming out
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:08.640]  in about 10 days. But he was not given post coverage by the big networks. That is outrageous.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.640]  It wasn't for lack of trying. I tried to try to pin them down and we couldn't get that.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.560]  Now they know, they know he's the hot ticket. They know that's what the people want and they
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.520]  know they keep giving him face time. It's over. He's going to win the nomination. Jesse, I'm going
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.160]  to let you go in just a minute and I appreciate all your time and I want to get you and the
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.640]  campaign chairman and the congressman back up in the next two to three weeks or anytime you want
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.720]  to pop in with an announcement or if you need support or need to rally the tribes in any way
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.840]  with our audience. And again, we're honored to have you and we're all praying for you and the
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:47.280]  congressman and the whole team. Just to give you details, an Infowars.com reporter was in and he's
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.320]  on the line right now. I'm going to bring him up after you're gone. He was there. He just confronted
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.200]  Giuliani about some of his actions on 9-11 where Giuliani said he got word the towers were going
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.920]  to fall. He told Peter Jennings that. We have the video. We talked to Giuliani a week ago about this.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.320]  He denied he ever said it. Now we have the interview. They went back and talked to his
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.320]  campaign people and said hey you said this and they just freaked out and said get away from me
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.360]  and the police ran up and arrested our reporter and then threatened to charge him. I'm not joking.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.880]  They said with espionage. Does this sound like America to you when he had official CNN press
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:27.440]  passes? I have not seen anything other than your report at this point right now so for me to comment
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:32.720]  too strongly would be inappropriate but I am very much looking forward to seeing these videos up
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:37.680]  on YouTube and getting a little bit of information because on you know on first sniff this just
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.480]  stinks and I can't wait to see a little bit more and if it's you know if it's if it's if it's
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.280]  anything like like the reports are right now then the American people need to take a real strong look
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.000]  at this all right Jesse Benton thank you for all the time we'll talk to you soon my friend thank
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.600]  you Alex there goes Jesse Benton he is the media coordinator the head of the media operations for

[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.480]  course uh Luke Radowski and I'm going to keep you guys into the next hour I appreciate you all
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:18.400]  holding hadn't really no sleep driving back the four hours from New Hampshire to New York
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:25.120]  Manhattan where they live uh they're at Luke's apartment right now uh Matt uh please continue
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.760]  with what happened once they put you in handcuffs the the stepping on the camera the rest of it
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:36.240]  where that went from there all right so um they pretty much they put me about it you know they
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.240]  bend you over the police car right maybe sitting there bent over the police car for three minutes
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.200]  or so looking like an idiot all right then they put me into the into the back of the police car
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.640]  waiting around for 10 15 minutes because no one knew what was going on didn't know what I was
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.200]  being charged with I was never told what I was trying they had to find somebody they had to find
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.880]  somebody pre-emptive I mean retroactively after the fact to claim that you were trespassing sure
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.560]  go ahead okay um so basically I'm in the car and they put me in the front seat to begin with all
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.800]  right and I've got my uh but basically I start you know moving around or whatever trying to adjust
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.640]  my hand trying to adjust the handcuffs you know just moving I'm not in this particular situation
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:21.280]  before I've never been arrested I'm not a renegade I'm not a radical you know so I tried to adjust
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.920]  it and this guy one of these cops officers looked at me opened up the door took me out tightened the
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.000]  cuff cuffed even tighter just like you see young cops you know and puts it back in there and says
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.840]  if you do that again you're going to be charged with this this this and that or whatever so
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.920]  whatever we're waiting around a couple more minutes by the way I've been arrested quite a few
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.000]  you know times at protests and things and yeah I mean when they put them on really tight of course
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.720]  you want to wiggle and move or it's hurting oh no see now moving is a crime we got to fill all these
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:55.520]  labyrinth prisons go ahead so um another car but another car pulls up they transfer me to it I go
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:01.280]  into the other cop car I'm on the way and uh long story short I had an opportunity to speak with a
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.680]  lot of these cops there um three of them were absolute a-holes the one that I was speaking with
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.440]  not to say that if he was you know he got a phone call to say shoot the guy he wouldn't you know
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:14.160]  but uh the guy I was speaking to dude he really he was receptive we gave him all the Alex Jones
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.320]  information none of the mysteries terrorist from the whole deal anyhow this guy was sort of
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.600]  receptive and when I got back to the booking office and everything we were talking about this
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.160]  whole thing for the entire time talking about everything you know from this that a to z this
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.440]  one guy you know in comparison to all the other a-holes over there you know really stood out among
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.280]  the crowd again not to say that if you got a phone call saying throw this guy in a cage you wouldn't
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.240]  do anything you know but um it was it was interesting that perspective this is the guy
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:46.160]  that you heard um you know when they went to turn off the notebook after they got after we actually
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:51.600]  got back to the police station we pulled up to this it was freaking me out actually because
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:58.240]  obviously I'm aware that Giuliani is mafioso all righty so um you know as there's also always a
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.080]  paranoia part of this as you're you're going through these things you're trying to react
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.000]  the best you possibly can remain calm and you're not sure whether you're pretending your main calm
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.400]  or actually are but for the most part we get in there we pull up we reach this gate the gate
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:18.400]  starts to rise up we pull in it's a small little cubby we go out you know he went hooks the back
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:23.120]  the backpacking he starts talking about the fact that you know is this recording is this recording
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.520]  I see the light is on I have to go through several explanations about why the light's still on there's
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.160]  an external battery pack connected yada yada do they freak out when you explain this has been
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.320]  transmitted over the web live I was seeing it the whole time because Alex I researched this a
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.000]  long time ago and I found out about as long as you tell them it's fine you know I told them a
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.600]  thousand times you're on live internet television we're trying to make a spectacle out of this stuff
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.200]  understand we're trying to make truth tv and take back the media here yeah what do you think we're
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:53.520]  broadcasting a tv show here you twit yeah I mean uh this is a cnn uh anti-propaganda they have a
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.240]  sign over there it says cnn equal politics duh cnn equals politics and we know that already thank
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.600]  you very much cnn equals property so what happened once they learned that they've been
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.920]  recorded so uh once they learned they recorded he says you know that's where he gives me the
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.680]  explanation and perhaps you heard it on the live stream he said actually in new hampshire we had
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.600]  this law and I said you know actually I researched a little bit before and it's actually a two-party
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:19.440]  yada yada as long as one of us has uh consent then it doesn't matter they're at a public event
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:25.520]  there's no expectation of privacy they put handcuffs on me I never had opportunity to

[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.880]  about it none of the candidates came out it was like they knew we were there just to prevent us
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.960]  from questioning him and he knows really weird you know matt lapacek was a gentleman asking him a
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.480]  question and the poster the guy the juliani's campaign manager engaged matt actually engaged
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.160]  backing him and that and that's when they when they grabbed him and they started pulling him out
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.920]  and i was separate i was far away from that and i was just like he didn't do nothing
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.760]  and as soon as i said that didn't that guy just ooze mafioso yeah he does ooze mafioso but guess

[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.760]  phone after you're done go ahead well i'd just like to say that this didn't even really start
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.160]  with luke myself or matt there was an independent journalist about four foot five maybe 55 years old
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.000]  who stepped into the middle and started talking about ron paul to these three press people they
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.760]  seem to get a little agitated and i asked a follow-up question well you know it made
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.960]  mainstream media ron paul asked if he had read the 9-11 commission report blowback imperial imperial
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:38.240]  hubris and others basically his argument for why they hate us and they couldn't answer me they
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.880]  couldn't answer me they tried to turn it up around on iran it was at that moment that matt asked
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.000]  about the collapse yet again and by that time you really saw the press coming up and then you saw
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.320]  the police coming up now matt starts asking his question about that and as they're dragging him
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:00.400]  away uh samuel atero asked his ask his people about his connections to centrist corp and they
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:06.000]  start dragging samuel away so we actually have the tape of matt getting arrested and cuffed outside
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.640]  we literally didn't get back till 7 a.m today slept for four hours and i'm sitting next to him

[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.160]  show on gcn live it's on stream 4 so hopefully we'll have some stuff for that but basically when
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.640]  they took samuel out he's like look we're on the list we were press credentials you don't know about
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.520]  centrist corp i mean you're the media you're supposed to know so police let them back in
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.120]  all of a sudden the media surrounded samuel he told them all about centrist corp
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.680]  meanwhile you know matt is being arrested yeah for those that don't know that's the big spanish

[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:07.600]  than previous bills that have been public from what the analysis we've gotten it's a secret bill
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:13.040]  is it was as bad no no it's far worse we have a bunch of ron paul clips and juliani clips calling

[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.000]  six months long we have juliani's comments that were 17 minutes oh that's a fair debate you heard
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.880]  ron paul's campaign saying yes it's rigged it's rigged six minutes versus over 15 minutes he's
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.480]  rigged okay uh matt let's bring matt lapace sick uh this is uh info wars dot com reporter who got
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.800]  grabbed matt i want to say you've got the right stuff we're very calm you were very focused we're
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.720]  going to air the three-minute audio of this coming up in the next segment but what else
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:56.640]  happened to you matt lapace when you were inside of the state police facility well basically within
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.920]  the state police facility i'm sitting there waiting around wondering what i'd be in charge
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.680]  with because i asked that question several times in the car and said oh we think it's uh
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.600]  trespassing we're not exactly sure we're gonna get back to the station get this all figured out
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.640]  so i'm sitting there waiting around and um he all of a sudden gets a phone call and he says okay yes
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:19.520]  it's criminal trespassing right um and from that point forward i we received another phone call from
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.760]  a gentleman saying that you know they were someone was going coming to pick me up you know having no
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.480]  idea who this person was and then we then started contacting mike nar and uh the other uh guys with
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.480]  team leaders over here that are with us trying to see who was going to come pick me up from the place
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.800]  so i ended up being in there for about an hour and a half or so and uh there wasn't too many
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.880]  other events that took place once i was actually in there um i can tell you that once we got
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.200]  outside of the parking lot all of us were there we were all filming them and they tried the police
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.720]  officer who i was saying was you know respectable at least okay um you know was taking issue with
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.120]  the fact that we were recording them and again bringing up the fact you always got to love that
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.600]  i mean i mean they got cameras in school bathrooms cameras all over the streets and they're like don't
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  film us oh it's our privacy oh yeah wait wait wait and these these people progressive rest
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.720]  progressive grassroots is how we're going to take control of this machine we have to understand
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:18.000]  it's an uphill battle you know but uh we can do this you know one man can do it um anybody can do
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.600]  this hey and matt it's a lot more exciting isn't it to be fighting the new world order than bowling
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.600]  or you know trying to act cool for some girl i mean this is this is how you really you are a man
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.240]  this is how you really you know become a man is just fighting the new world order this is what it's
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:40.560]  all about it's what men are supposed to do and you guys are just i admire you guys and i just am glad
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:45.760]  to be associated with you and everybody in this movement i am just so blessed so they were trying
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.080]  to tell you to quit videotaping and that is just so classic and on that i would say alex i mean
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.320]  obviously you know this already here i mean you're like a recharge for us over here i mean if we didn't
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.360]  have you to listen to we didn't have someone to bitch about the the moan and um and basically
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.560]  represent us and fight for us you know we wouldn't have the necessarily the strength and energy we
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:07.760]  have so i think the brotherhood and the sisterhood of all of us together and everything that we're
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.520]  doing here we stand up as one against these evil mothers you know if we actually do something we
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.040]  can take we can take this back the small ideas creativity truth tv take back the media once at
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.600]  that time we've got this whole live air coverage to you guys we're not doing this to become powerful
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.960]  we're doing this because we want you guys to do it we've got a six page white paper we're
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.160]  publishing you guys can be able to do the same thing on your own cell phones and be able to
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.120]  publish this stuff we are encouraging everyone to get out there ask the same questions start
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:40.080]  media groups okay that's always been the problem is that they can grab your cameras like when i had
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:45.440]  special forces order you just in san antonio order the mps to come up with guns to our chest
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.440]  and steal our tape that was in world net daily because the you know the troops admitted they
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.000]  did arrest us or detain us but you know we we don't have the video because they took it
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.280]  and so many times they take it but if you've got this live feed i mean literally i thought i wonder
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.520]  what the guys are doing so i i just put the children to bed i was about to go back to work
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.040]  and uh i just kissed my wife goodnight i walked downstairs about 8 30 central 9 30 eastern about
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:14.880]  8 20 actually i click on wearechanged.org and there's the stream like oh it hasn't crashed
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:20.480]  and just to see the exchange right before you got grabbed right when the cops came up and then it
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.200]  cut out and then i left then i looked at message boards and they said yeah i heard him in the squad
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.640]  car i heard it all this is the future and uh it's just we've got to get some better connectivity
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.240]  system and get some more out this is just a question of we're we're trying to stream like
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.840]  this so we don't have to pay for the bandwidth we're using free services and we've gone from
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.400]  one after another stick them to cam stream and it won't work none of it none of the free stuff
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.560]  works let me tell you something it would have cost to feed everybody listen if we put that on
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:51.600]  our front page we tried to stream it out let's say to 15 000 people which probably would have
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.760]  tried to watch it last night just randomly that's a guesstimation it'd have been about
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.000]  yeah probably about three grand but you know what if i i'll dump the money into it i just
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  don't care anymore we'll be right back

[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.320]  luke and you up together we'll go back to matt lapacek in a minute uh who's specifically there's
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.320]  so many here i can't keep track of it anymore who was specifically you guys got to talk about isi
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:19.280]  and uh it was uh biden senator biden admitted that he met with the isi chief we got an article
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.840]  on that at prison planet.com yesterday again it's an orgy of news folks this stuff i can talk a week
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.520]  about each one of these articles uh i don't even know how we're supposed to cover it all i'm
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.280]  literally finding at the mouth here there's so many targets i mean like it's like the marines when
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.160]  they were surrounded in uh in the fight against north korea back in the 50s and they said you know
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.960]  they radioed in to the general sir you know we're surrounded the general was in the middle of them
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.520]  and he said good don't let him you know any of them escape i mean this is just awesome i mean
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.600]  this is this is what you want when you're in the info war swinging your battle axes to have them all
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:56.560]  around you there's more people you can't miss you start hacking uh but uh jason uh that's pretty
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:04.320]  exciting that they did get the isi discussion with uh senator biden but uh come in with your info with
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.040]  uh brownback you were able to talk to yeah i talked to brownback among others but brownback's
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.920]  answer was the most interesting of all none of the candidates i talked to actually denied the isi
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.840]  transfer and that was duncan hunter jim gilmore and uh and sam brownback i think i got somebody
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.000]  else but brownback said something pretty funny to me i said well you know why don't the american
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.560]  people know about this pakistani funding he's like well probably the same reason that they don't know
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:33.360]  about the saudi arabian funding and then i followed it up with well could these two uh
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.840]  foreign governments be involved in the 27 redacted pages of the congressional report
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.520]  and he just he looked for a second he kind of shook his head he said i can't really comment
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:48.000]  on that so i i mean everybody i talked to in the mainstream couldn't couldn't deny the actual isi
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  connection at all it was it was just uh yeah it was pretty wild man and and you know these guys
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  these guys can't deny it anymore and i think this is a good angle to start you know this
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.320]  independent investigation i keep telling listeners when your congressmen or women come to your local
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:06.400]  church to give a speech and they come to the local rotary club when they go to anything you
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:12.560]  need to be there whether you're a uh you know an old korean war vet or a school teacher or black
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:20.080]  man a white woman it doesn't matter hispanic black texas new york california i don't care
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.160]  all of you have a responsibility if we start confronting them and i made this point earlier
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.520]  but i want to make it again that's why they're setting up this this national police state in
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.560]  this worldwide grid they're banning confronting or even talking to the royals or members of
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.440]  parliament or having video cameras and sites all over england while they put up tens of millions of
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.520]  cameras now over five million in london alone they're trying to ban speech here with free
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:46.560]  speech zones that's why they want tracker chips as nick rockefeller told aaron russo that's coming
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.280]  up at end game they they're doing all of this by the way i gotta get that tommy thomas from you
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:56.320]  that will go in end game i'm so glad you got that bermas chasen bermas i commend you uh all of this
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:03.040]  happening all of this going on and and i mean because they're afraid they've got to get their
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.880]  grit in because they want to do all these bad things to us they want to take over the economy
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.480]  they want to bankrupt the dollar they want to take your pension funds they said they're going
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:14.720]  to do it they've changed the rules so they claim they can but they can't until they can
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:20.160]  oppress you when you fight back jason comments yeah absolutely i got some of these uh you know
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.280]  candidates actually admit that yes the current immigration legislation is worse than blanket
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.520]  amnesty everything you're saying about it is true it's not a pathway to citizenship it's a
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.240]  worker's visa forced citizenship and then you can bring in 11 of your family members that is the
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.120]  truth this would kill this country i talked about the american union with a lot of these people none

[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.160]  video of this what did you see happen well i actually just shot uh some audio of it and i
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.880]  took some pictures i didn't have a camera on me but from what i saw my vantage point was
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:25.360]  actually exactly the same as the camera that's on the jones report so i pretty much saw it all in
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.560]  person and i could see someone gesturing to the police and the police just came over and uh took
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.440]  him right out and i uh i asked him why he got arrested and just followed him out did you get
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:43.200]  photos of him being cuffed i i have photos of that yes oh awesome because we don't have that yet
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.880]  uh how soon can you can email those to aaron at info wars dot com um almost immediately i mean
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.800]  don't you love it i'm here during the breaks writing articles on the telephone telling folks
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.920]  you know my my take on articles i'm gathering data on air listeners you're getting the whole
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.080]  bird's eye view this is how it all operates paul watson always jokes watch the government listen
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.360]  to our phones they hear it all on the air this is our life this is what we do we kind of multitask
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.000]  do it all in one spot and it's citizen reporters like yourself chris caesar or are you with the
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.960]  media or i mean tell us about yourself well i actually just want to contest that
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:22.480]  from the network withholding for uh bloggers so i am i am a reporter for a really small paper
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.360]  nearby but tell us tell us all about it it's called the triton times i mean it's certainly
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:34.960]  nothing uh of note but uh yeah this is certainly more important i mean what did you just you know
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:41.840]  just enough senator to sum it up what what was it like seeing this happen it was it was terrifying
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.480]  and i mean after i'd also witnessed eric alterman uh get arrested which was uh shocking thing uh you
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.200]  know we got the singing and whitewash on that what what really happened with it with eric alterman
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:00.480]  well i didn't see the uh inciting incident but it seemed like he was being totally calm and from
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.240]  what he said he was standing in a public venue as it was and gave an answer to the police officer
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:13.120]  that he didn't necessarily like and he cuffed him and uh i mean it so with that in mind and
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.640]  with seeing your reporters getting arrested i was trying to be as cautious as possible
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.520]  but when the police weren't even giving their badge numbers i started to get a little heated myself
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.840]  and eventually we got him to give the badge numbers but yeah it was just a completely
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:33.120]  terrifying thing to see it is scary because cnn even admits this guy cnn report right here they
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.320]  admit he did nothing he was just sitting there he had press passes cops walk up and they said
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.680]  we're cuffing you this is just some separate guy with a local newspaper uh there in new hampshire
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.880]  and we've got another local uh new hampshire news reporter chris cesar on the line with us
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.440]  let's bring up matt lapacek matt what is it like now seeing things through the eyes of chris cesar
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:59.760]  well i mean for the most part here i don't know if i really have a uh a comment but i gotta look
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.120]  at the footage myself i can barely remember what i said you know i was in the spirit i was in the
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.560]  moment there but i mean now you're hearing it from his angle see i talked to so many people
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.400]  we're getting a really clear picture of this this is this is juliani's people just going
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.920]  she's that name in the name of the crown and then you're just off to the who's count yeah i'm just
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.960]  glad we had the opportunity to do this you know there's this guy over here mike nar we've got
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.080]  so many guys working with us we wouldn't have had a dime to do this we wouldn't have a 35 foot rv
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.480]  you know we wouldn't have had the funding to do this kind of stuff we could change the world
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.480]  overnight i'm telling you people overnight revolution all right and pages like this would
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.240]  have a little bit of the funding to help us i'll make all the difference so so what's happening is
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.280]  is like i see a few cameras and some money other people donate cameras people come and donate the
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.400]  use of an rv it's just whatever you need is coming together side by side because we are
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:53.600]  changed partners as our this would be the crucial member of this organization that's so exciting
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.320]  and but again one of them my point is is that everybody together you're finding the resources
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.680]  you need absolutely and we're we're just starting this thing you know we started with a stickum a
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:09.600]  stickum broadcast and we're evolving surely but surely but uh slowly but surely and god knows
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.680]  where we will be in a week from now look what we've done in five six weeks look at luke started
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:19.040]  by himself with general brzezinski without not without without a brother near him okay he went
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.840]  there with an hour's notice and went and attacked these people himself verbally okay and this is a
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:28.960]  revolution and we have to understand that we have the power one man can do it but it doesn't need to
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.000]  be all right every one of us can stand up these people and we're going to get this paper out there
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.600]  because you will be surprised what kind of how secure and how full of your stuff you feel when
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:43.360]  you have a camera on you okay absolutely listen matt matt i i really do appreciate you and we're
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.360]  going to get you some another camera since they broke the other one and we're going to take care
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.560]  of that uh that uh bond but but you're going to beat this they're going to drop that we're going
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.720]  to put their numbers out tomorrow we're going to take action i really appreciate you joining us let
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:02.720]  me bring up uh luke radowski now luke uh is there anybody else that needs to get on the phone
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.320]  add their two cents worth and then i'm going to finish up with chris caesar here and then move
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:13.360]  on to the immigration you know alex yes go ahead yeah man i mean it's been a crazy day i mean we
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.680]  have mike nar here man he's the one who really uh done done most of the work here he's the one
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.320]  who really organized everything here and he was there actually he was watching a live feed from
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.040]  the rv as soon as you found out they're arresting he ran there and he had an inside perspective the
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:32.160]  police actually also detained him they detained mike nor one of our guys whatever let me talk to
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.360]  mike nar and then we'll go back to somebody who was out there while this was happening uh mr caesar
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:43.040]  chris caesar uh mike nar thank you for coming on with us how you doing alex good i know you guys
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.880]  are passing the phone around thank you for coming on uh describe what you saw when you were watching
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:52.160]  it on the video stream cam in the rv over the wireless internet and then you ran out to see them
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.920]  being let out the front talking about from different angles this is the future tell us
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.840]  what you witnessed well actually from the rv you know the feed was cutting a little bit in and out
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.600]  and we kind of went from a an interview uh to a pop-up of an audio thing why am i being arrested
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.320]  so uh we just reacted very quickly and i was acting kind of in the capacity of as luke and
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:17.520]  matt's producer on this so i ran over there as good as best as i could and uh you know uh by the
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.760]  time i got there i was pretty out of breath and i came on the scene there was already four cops
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:28.480]  uh that had matt pinned up uh against the wall and uh i i demanded uh to know as the producer
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:34.480]  uh why my man was being uh arrested and what charges were being filed against him and uh i
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:39.520]  think what we have here is a local you know police force you know that just got themselves involved
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.360]  in something you know that they thought you know there's a big time operation you know i get to deal
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.680]  with secret service and all these and they really got themselves in the middle of this thing and i
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.680]  don't know how they're going to dig themselves out uh it looked like secret service was directing
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:56.640]  the arrest because when we called last night we were told secret service was running it and then
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.040]  we had to talk to them absolutely let me tell you exactly what happened the chief of police was
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.680]  running around uh like a man uh like a chicken with his head cut off okay he came down to the
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:12.160]  arresting uh area and i was on my cell phone i was telling uh they were all baby jack bowers this was
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:17.120]  their day to fight al qaeda exactly and i was telling them i was on the cell phone with corporate
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.400]  i was on the cell phone with legal uh we're demanding to know exactly right now uh this
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:27.840]  moment we have live internet feed that's all this whole thing go down they were all on camera
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.960]  and uh the the memberships calling in uh the stockholders are calling and we need to know
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:38.240]  exactly what happened here and uh you know he had no answer i don't know i don't know so he had to
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:44.080]  run up the steps uh towards the secret service area uh to figure this whole thing out himself
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:49.760]  you know and then he came back down he tried to detain me okay and it was during this process
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.520]  that they were trying to uh explain how we were not legitimate media okay they were trying to
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.880]  figure out they decide and oh you're asking questions arrest him too well here's the great
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.440]  thing uh i'll box this man in a small party of people and he says hey i'm looking for my dad
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:12.480]  ron paul okay so ron paul's son was standing right i said you just came upon the scene i said
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:17.360]  uh you know alex jones is and the police are standing there and they're like of course we
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:22.800]  know who alex jones is he's one of the biggest you know my dad's always on that show and so
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.360]  they're just sitting there with their mouths dropped so ron paul's son is there
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.760]  bedlam going on yeah i talked to uh his media guy he already heard about it today by the before i
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.280]  got him on air this is just total insanity this is yeah i mean he ran up the steps and uh you know
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.240]  he had a powwow with some people and then he came back down and uh i said you know you you're
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.880]  you're telling me if i if i leave this position you're gonna arrest me you know he says no no no
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.960]  no no now you're now you're not detained uh you can do anything you want i said now getting back
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.440]  to this charge what is the charge again uh we think it's going to be criminal trespass they
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:05.440]  told us that's a license or privilege to enter situation okay uh i mean if you're at a bar and
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:10.320]  you cause a disruption you're thrown out that's a totally conduct if they tell you not to re-enter
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.320]  the bar and you'd have to have the bar owner's permission you know what i mean the bar the bar
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.520]  owner would have to have a complaint and that you are trespassing then they have to ascertain
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:25.360]  you were not invited and then they could do a basic trespass certainly not a criminal trespass
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.760]  no it's it's a false charge right and exactly what matt was trying to ascertain is who is the
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:36.560]  complainant who was who was the one directing his ads from college cnn because and we know who it
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:43.840]  was it was juliani goons some woman who had who was with his entourage with the campaign assaulted
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.000]  luke in my equipment uh and then she'd get herself out of trouble as some women have a tendency to do
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:56.480]  she went and made up a story okay they had a whisk matt away because they knew so i told them i said
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:00.560]  you know because the other media then started coming up and starting asking me questions hey
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.520]  what's going on we want to cover this and so they had to get him out of there but of course they did
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:09.760]  cover another arrest but not this arrest this is not being it's on drudge but only a link to live
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.480]  link in the video that somebody uploaded uh we need to get all this stuff uploaded now and we
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:19.360]  need to find out who this juliani goon is assaulting luke radowski and we need to get
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:25.440]  these number one these charges dropped uh against matt and as this develops i want to have you all

[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.000]  declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.760]  attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them terror storm proves that not only
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.600]  was 9 11 an inside job but the attacks of 77 in london were carried out by british intelligence

[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:19.680]  newspaper also has his own blog and he's chris caesar chris you ended up talking i guess
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.840]  afterwards to the lady that was going after luke's camera did you see that uh a b when you came up
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.880]  later to her what did she say i didn't see her take the camera i saw the camera get broken
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.000]  when they arrested matt um i mean that's a separate one i mean whenever she was at first
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.080]  going after luke and the camera yeah she definitely made a gesture uh and i think it
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.320]  was the same woman i thought afterwards who was talking to police that wanted a statement from her
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:52.320]  so i assume that she definitely made the complaint uh and i just asked her you know don't you think
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:55.920]  that they would have been left because she was telling him that they were being antagonistic
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.480]  and stuff and i said don't you think they would have been a lot more polite and respectful
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.600]  if the campaign staffer answered the question and she looked at me like i was from mars
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:12.480]  and said uh you know what question well number one who is she to be going around ordering people
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:18.480]  to be arrested exactly yeah did you get her name tag what was her name she didn't have a name tag
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:24.240]  unfortunately i might have her voice very faintly on my tape recorder here but uh i couldn't
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:29.920]  identify her i may upload that if you can you are awesome we'll put it up on youtube or google and
