[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:32.400]  all right a lot of really important news I'm gonna get you out of the gates here coming up in t-minus one hour Robert
[00:32.400 --> 00:39.960]  Broden is gonna be joining us for two hours now Robert Broden is probably the
[00:39.960 --> 00:48.040]  JFK assassination insider he's the guy that well got the copy of the Zabruder
[00:48.040 --> 00:52.560]  film and leaked it out to the public he's the person that leaked out the
[00:52.560 --> 00:57.680]  photos of the back of Kennedy's head blown off he was uniquely placed to
[00:57.680 --> 01:04.640]  expose all that he was the chief consultant an expert Jim Marsel write
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.480]  the screenplay and consulted as well but he was the chief consultant on the
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.920]  Oliver Stone film JFK he's never been on this show and I've been consulting with
[01:15.920 --> 01:21.320]  him and working with him on my JFK film it's about continuity of government the
[01:21.320 --> 01:28.680]  fascist connection the new E Howard Hunt revelations but only again it gets into
[01:28.680 --> 01:35.000]  areas never before covered as part of the JFK assassination but now we have the
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.280]  vast majority more than 90% of the American people in all major polls
[01:38.280 --> 01:42.320]  believing the government killed Kennedy the truth is out there but I thought we
[01:42.320 --> 01:48.240]  would have the preeminent expert on today and take your phone calls and get
[01:48.240 --> 01:54.920]  into the new revelation now we've had this video for about six months and I
[01:54.920 --> 01:59.880]  was piling up footage piling up research we watched it six months ago I kept
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.120]  meaning to put a mini film together before we even put it in black sunshine
[02:04.120 --> 02:09.920]  the continuity of government slash JFK film I'm making that Broden by the way
[02:09.920 --> 02:20.160]  is going to be in as well with some new revelations by the way but I kept
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.160]  meaning to get around to putting this video out well we finally in the last
[02:24.160 --> 02:29.240]  week edited together with some other video and images and documents never
[02:29.240 --> 02:32.600]  before seen footage you know there's there's the audio tape released a year
[02:32.600 --> 02:37.720]  ago and the Rolling Stone covering the handwritten notes were E Howard Hunt
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.960]  admitted to being involved with the assassination of JFK we'd always known
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.360]  that had been picked up as one of the tramps but here he was admitting it
[02:47.360 --> 02:54.440]  that and then people said oh no St. John Hunt the Rolling Stone is lying and so
[02:54.440 --> 03:02.600]  he just released the audio tape well he gave us the video and by the way there's
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.720]  a lot more where this came from but we put out the most dangerous stuff that I
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.320]  it's not even fearlessness it's in a way it's stupidity that I could just
[03:12.320 --> 03:16.480]  calmly sit here relaxing having this tape when they already tried to run St.
[03:16.480 --> 03:20.520]  John off the road they already broke into his house tried to steal everything
[03:20.520 --> 03:29.120]  rifled through all the papers I mean I'm just unbelievably callous I guess
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.360]  living the life of danger here make no mistake there's danger involved they're
[03:33.360 --> 03:36.880]  still killing people over the Kennedy assassination who have had this video for
[03:36.880 --> 03:42.120]  six months and so last week I said look we know we keep meaning to put a little
[03:42.120 --> 03:47.880]  mini film out about this and add a bunch of documentation to it just put it out
[03:47.880 --> 03:55.840]  just put I we sat down one night watched the hours of it and I just said
[03:55.840 --> 04:02.880]  that's the most dangerous stuff that's the key stuff get that out now in fact I
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.600]  know St. John wants it it's you know larger portions of it in the film but
[04:06.600 --> 04:09.240]  I'm gonna call him today just say look St. John I just want to put the whole
[04:09.240 --> 04:18.280]  thing on YouTube I don't even want this video sitting around here but that
[04:18.280 --> 04:21.680]  matter the most damning stuff is there we're just nonchalantly talking about
[04:21.680 --> 04:27.320]  how they killed Kennedy why they killed Kennedy why LBJ wanted it done talks
[04:27.320 --> 04:34.240]  about Harvey who we know had run assassinations all over the world and so
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.920]  the videos there it's pretty historic and we kind of released it with a whimper
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.880]  not a bang last night we even put on the YouTube video that it's a world
[04:42.880 --> 04:47.320]  exclusive and ever before seen we were so used to just being so close to
[04:47.320 --> 04:51.160]  bombshell information that we I think lose perspective on just how important

[09:06.680 --> 09:13.400]  clone info coming up but right now let's go ahead and just play a few minutes
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.920]  the never before heard or seen E Howard Hunt I mean this is him on video close
[09:18.920 --> 09:25.360]  up of his face talking about who and how Kennedy was killed here it is I could
[09:25.360 --> 09:37.040]  just visualize Harvey and LBJ forming a kind of a thieves compact between them
[09:37.040 --> 09:49.400]  but I think that LBJ was an opportunist and if it was not hesitated to get rid
[09:49.400 --> 09:57.480]  of obstacles in his way I took his later career exemplified that the vice
[09:57.480 --> 10:04.800]  president had the most to gain now and he was in a position where he could
[10:04.800 --> 10:14.640]  bring in people like corn buyer and others of interest and get their tank
[10:14.640 --> 10:24.560]  on different things and then in turn issue instructions there was nobody
[10:24.560 --> 10:33.240]  with the leverage and that LBJ and no competitor he was the vice president and
[10:33.240 --> 10:41.480]  if he wanted to get rid of the president that he had the ability to do so by
[10:41.480 --> 10:50.440]  corrupting different people in CIA and he had to do it with the limitations of
[10:50.440 --> 10:58.400]  CIA because there was no other group that honored I could use that term who
[10:58.400 --> 11:06.600]  honored the clandestine limitations the way CIA did they could do something
[11:06.600 --> 11:13.520]  turned their back on it move on to something else to not like a military
[11:13.520 --> 11:23.040]  there was no accounting in that sense and we know the LBJ had an unlimited
[11:23.040 --> 11:32.080]  ambition and we know that he was a corrupt individual and that the dollar
[11:32.080 --> 11:39.160]  sign was very important to him as vice president he didn't have the leverage
[11:39.160 --> 11:49.680]  that a president did or would and so that was an attractive goal for LBJ he
[11:49.680 --> 11:56.400]  did not want his career to come to an end as vice president who knows about
[11:56.400 --> 12:05.120]  vice presidents it was very very important to him and that he take
[12:05.120 --> 12:12.520]  advantage as to the extent that he could as vice president because just a few
[12:12.520 --> 12:18.440]  things had to be accomplished he had to kill Kennedy have or haven't killed
[12:18.440 --> 12:30.440]  LBJ and be guilt-free himself that he could go on and do what he wanted to do
[12:30.440 --> 12:42.480]  as president of the United States it was a very tempting and almost a logical
[12:42.480 --> 12:51.920]  move on his part I keep thinking about Bill Harvey all right Harvey and say look
[12:51.920 --> 12:55.920]  again you can go watch the rest of it it's even more hardcore I mean I can't
[12:55.920 --> 13:02.720]  believe in my life that this radio show the films we make that I mean we've got
[13:02.720 --> 13:06.040]  people like Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson talking about the government
[13:06.040 --> 13:11.080]  blowing up the towers and German defense ministers and high-level members of
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.760]  Japanese Parliament and Hollywood stars like Charlie Sheen and film directors
[13:15.760 --> 13:22.720]  like Rick Linklater on there telling us that we've woken up Bruce Willis and my
[13:22.720 --> 13:28.440]  strange life we just nonchalantly have videotapes lying around that nobody's
[13:28.440 --> 13:37.560]  ever seen with him spilling his guts he Howard Hunt of course that's admitted
[13:37.560 --> 13:41.840]  the TV show and then films it's Ethan Hunt Mission Impossible that's modeled
[13:41.840 --> 13:51.600]  after him the most famous CIA blackout commander in history and it's just very
[13:51.600 --> 13:58.680]  strange that this information is coming out it's surreal there are people in the
[13:58.680 --> 14:05.240]  info wars.com article posting comments and they're saying yeah this is a good
[14:05.240 --> 14:11.760]  video the headline world exclusive he Howard Hunt tells JFK plot on video
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.360]  Aaron did a great job editing the video I'm putting it up there yesterday and I
[14:15.360 --> 14:18.520]  called him last night when he put it up I left about 10 got home about 11 saw the
[14:18.520 --> 14:24.520]  story post and I called him I said Aaron you don't even say world exclusive on
[14:24.520 --> 14:32.200]  this so he did add that to the article but not the YouTube video title but
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.120]  people are in their posting going hey you know he's covering up he's saying
[14:37.120 --> 14:43.640]  and only went up to LBJ and I like tarply but you know tarply made me mad like a
[14:43.640 --> 14:49.280]  year ago when we were first airing these audio tapes this is separate video not
[14:49.280 --> 14:52.280]  just the video of the audio this is separate video you just heard the audio
[14:52.280 --> 14:57.840]  off it's new new to the public and you know tarply said the same thing on the
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.040]  show well we're all hearing now that this info that it was LBJ alone that ran it
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.240]  no we're not he Howard Hunt was taking orders from the president that's as high
[15:09.240 --> 15:13.200]  as the chain of command went for him it's like if you have a mafia capo
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.840]  taking orders from a Don and the Don's had a meeting you know a few months
[15:17.840 --> 15:25.040]  before and the capo running the hit wasn't privy to the meeting of the
[15:25.040 --> 15:29.960]  mafia chiefs so he knows the mafia chief that they were getting orders from
[15:29.960 --> 15:35.920]  and then I'm not even here criticizing people this is just for open discussion
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.360]  this is the type of nitpicking that is endemic everywhere in the alternative
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.640]  media that we bring you this incredible revelation we risk our lives to bring it
[15:46.640 --> 15:51.360]  to you and make no mistake it's dangerous dealing with this and I just want
[15:51.360 --> 15:57.160]  that noted no one can deny it and then it's oh you know they're they're they're
[15:57.160 --> 15:59.800]  covering up for the new world order they're they're saying only one of the
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.560]  LBJ when in the videos we've released in the radio interviews we did we pointed
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.960]  out that it was Nixon involved in a bunch of other people and above them
[16:08.960 --> 16:15.240]  Rothschild and Rockefellers and the CFR and the oil family the hunts out of
[16:15.240 --> 16:21.560]  Texas no relation to eat hard hunt I mean it's just incredible to be on the
[16:21.560 --> 16:26.280]  field day after day week after week month after month year after year just
[16:26.280 --> 16:31.760]  trying to expose the new world order musting our hines to do it and so I
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.920]  mean this is a very important story and it needs to be seen it needs to go viral
[16:35.920 --> 16:40.320]  on the web so I'm enlisting our wonderful listeners and activists out
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.880]  there do your own reports on your own blogs and to call them to talk radio
[16:44.880 --> 16:48.400]  shows and email this to talk shows and you know tell them to talk about it and
[16:48.400 --> 16:52.320]  cover it and deal with it because people always say well a conspiracy like 9-11
[16:52.320 --> 16:59.200]  or Gulf of Tonkin or USS Liberty or JFK you know people would talk people would
[16:59.200 --> 17:06.080]  speak out it would come out well they do and close to 500 people
[17:06.080 --> 17:11.800]  conservatively were murdered in and around the JFK assassination tying up
[17:11.800 --> 17:16.320]  loose ends Barry Jennings talked about bombs going off explosions before
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.560]  either tower collapsed he was in building seven 300 yards away he's in
[17:21.560 --> 17:24.360]  there with the head of the New York emergency management he was the deputy
[17:24.360 --> 17:31.080]  head and the media starts trying to discredit it and suddenly he dies and
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.400]  they won't say why he died or another witness who saw bombs going off he dies
[17:35.400 --> 17:47.360]  same week back in August I mean living in the real world is I don't want to say
[17:47.360 --> 17:51.920]  frightening it's it's bracing it's like walking out on a freezing cold winter
[17:51.920 --> 17:57.720]  day with cold wind blowing in the face it really wakes you up and lets you know
[17:57.720 --> 18:03.120]  what you're dealing with and I think all of us should every day just reassess and
[18:03.120 --> 18:07.560]  and and and and recalibrate kind of restart our computer and in real life
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.400]  we really have a new world order they really put poison in the water they
[18:11.400 --> 18:14.880]  really spray our skies with poison they now admit they're doing that they say
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.560]  it's for climate control but we know it's toxic that's now in mainstream news
[18:18.560 --> 18:22.480]  and it's now mainstream news are setting up a trilateral world currency in a
[18:22.480 --> 18:29.400]  world government run by the banks where you pay carbon tax where you pay carbon
[18:29.400 --> 18:36.280]  taxes to the private banks and the CPS really does grab over a million children
[18:36.280 --> 18:42.240]  a year without due process criminally and government really does test pesticides
[18:42.240 --> 18:46.040]  and chemicals and drugs that killed children foster children and it's in
[18:46.040 --> 18:51.960]  the mainstream news and the FDA is going after now vitamin companies and
[18:51.960 --> 18:56.920]  shutting them down and they don't even have court proceedings they just they
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.720]  just use the Patriot Act on live articles about that today and with the
[19:00.720 --> 19:04.240]  bailout it really is at least five trillion dollars we told you that a month
[19:04.240 --> 19:09.400]  ago now it's mainstream news here at Ron Paul last week say it's actually right

[19:14.920 --> 19:20.120]  today having post they won't say where the trillions are going they just like
[19:20.120 --> 19:23.720]  when two trillion was missing the AP reported on it the two days before 9
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.480]  11 now it's over four trillion last time I saw a congressional hearing on it two
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.200]  years ago it was four trillion just gone the Pentagon pension funds the
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.600]  investments it's in and then the Myers and Rumsfeld two years ago they just got
[19:38.600 --> 19:42.200]  up and said we're not going to tell you where it is now your business comes and
[19:42.200 --> 19:45.440]  they really are threatening Congress with martial law and they really are
[19:45.440 --> 19:50.760]  deploying army brigades you read carefully it's a whole bunch of them not
[19:50.760 --> 19:54.360]  just one there's talk reporting on the new one they're deploying I mean it's
[19:54.360 --> 20:01.600]  it's really happening we better get our heads screwed on straight a day unlike
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.640]  any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against
[20:06.640 --> 20:11.360]  this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[20:11.360 --> 20:15.400]  been locked in this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we have to
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.440]  look to the sum of that law table enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a
[20:19.440 --> 20:23.400]  close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United
[20:23.400 --> 20:27.600]  States some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much

[21:12.200 --> 21:16.400]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw for the
[21:16.400 --> 21:19.960]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[21:19.960 --> 21:24.360]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions

[22:28.040 --> 22:33.680]  why retreat this is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.240]  answer if they could that same 90% would have to admit that things may not
[22:38.240 --> 22:42.000]  continue on as they are now they would also have to admit that they will need
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.120]  a retreat something completely impossible for the average American to do

[24:01.400 --> 24:13.400]  It seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[24:18.400 --> 24:26.400]  All those visitors days are past me now. I've got so much more to think about.
[24:26.400 --> 24:35.400]  Deadlines. Deadlines and commitments. What to leave in. What to leave out.
[24:37.400 --> 24:48.400]  Against the wind. We were running against the wind. We were young and strong. We found ourselves seeking shelter.
[24:48.400 --> 24:58.400]  Still just running against the wind.
[24:58.400 --> 25:05.400]  Against the wind. Against the wind.
[25:05.400 --> 25:12.400]  Scott, Randy, Kevin, Mike, Matthew, Briden. Your calls are coming up momentarily.
[25:12.400 --> 25:19.400]  Your calls and others at 1-800-259-9231. As I end to the last segment, I'm
[25:19.400 --> 25:23.400]  telling you folks you need to reset all of us to myself included and just
[25:23.400 --> 25:29.400]  realize how incrementally the tyranny is intensifying all around us.
[25:29.400 --> 25:33.400]  I mean, they're putting body scanners that our mainstream media even admits are
[25:33.400 --> 25:39.400]  basically electronic strip searches. They're storing images of our neck and
[25:39.400 --> 25:44.400]  bodies, the humiliation, all in the name of stopping terrorism that the rulers of
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.400]  this planet themselves are conducting against us so we will acquiesce to
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.400]  being slaves. Very simple equation. They post terror so they have a pretext to
[25:53.400 --> 26:00.400]  rule and dominate. Real simple. And they are engaging in an economic terrorism
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.400]  and consolidation and setting up the foretold world government run for and by
[26:04.400 --> 26:10.400]  the banks where you pay taxes directly to them.
[26:10.400 --> 26:18.400]  It's just amazing. And every day it hits me. Man, this is a real fight.
[26:18.400 --> 26:22.400]  These people are real. The reason they haven't killed me is because they don't
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.400]  want to underline everything I say, put an exclamation point on it, highlight it.
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.400]  They don't want to make me a martyr. And I realize they could go ahead and do it
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.400]  any time they still do it. To many people that are prominent just to scare
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.400]  people into submission. Then I realize for the weak, for the innocent, for
[26:38.400 --> 26:42.400]  humanity, that's why we even exist is because people fought and stood up
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.400]  against tyranny before us. Everything good in the world is because people have
[26:46.400 --> 26:51.400]  sacrificed. And I'm committed and that's the good feeling here is that there's
[26:51.400 --> 26:57.400]  no going back once you're on the road to liberty and justice and freedom.
[26:57.400 --> 27:02.400]  Once you set yourself against the dark side, there is no turning back.
[27:02.400 --> 27:11.400]  There is no turning back on this road.
[27:11.400 --> 27:13.400]  There's a lot of news here, but let's just go ahead and go to your calls now.
[27:13.400 --> 27:16.400]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[27:16.400 --> 27:19.400]  Hey Alex, how are you doing? Good, my friend.
[27:19.400 --> 27:22.400]  Hey, a question I have for you is a couple different ones.
[27:22.400 --> 27:28.400]  One being the news thing that you just had right now, what you just played that clip.
[27:28.400 --> 27:31.400]  What do you think the mainstream media would pick up on that?
[27:31.400 --> 27:36.400]  Since it's going to go YouTube, do you think they would play that?
[27:36.400 --> 27:38.400]  Are you getting me into that?
[27:38.400 --> 27:43.400]  No, no, no, no. St. John's tried to bring it to the national media and none of them
[27:43.400 --> 27:47.400]  have touched it except the Rolling Stone. And then they wrote a story about St. John
[27:47.400 --> 27:51.400]  Hunt and then kind of the last paragraph said, oh by the way, there's
[27:51.400 --> 27:56.400]  handwritten notes and audio tapes of his dad saying they ran the operation to kill Kennedy.
[27:56.400 --> 28:01.400]  And then the media said, oh, that isn't real. And so he released it, you know,
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.400]  the audio here on this show and on Coast to Coast AM and a few others.
[28:05.400 --> 28:08.400]  And then now for the first time you see the video itself.
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.400]  So of course the establishment, I mean the Chicago Tribune and a few other publications
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.400]  reported that the NS80 classified, CIA classified earlier this year,
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.400]  that it's true Israel knowingly attacked the ship. Israel admits it.
[28:22.400 --> 28:27.400]  They had the NSA intercepts where Israel knew and what the pilot said about five years ago.
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.400]  They had Israeli pilot apologized on Israeli TV and broke down crying and said,
[28:32.400 --> 28:35.400]  I refuse three times. They ordered me to do it anyways. That's an American ship.
[28:35.400 --> 28:39.400]  It's an American ship. And they threatened him. They said, you will attack it.
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.400]  And, you know, so we already had his testimony, but now it's backed up by the
[28:44.400 --> 28:49.400]  declassified NSA intercepts. So, but you think that would have become big national news
[28:49.400 --> 28:54.400]  that, oh, hey, all these books written, all these TV shows written by the establishment
[28:54.400 --> 29:00.400]  to debunk the men on that ship and the admirals and others on the aircraft carriers
[29:00.400 --> 29:04.400]  that had told the truth. And the later chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.400]  Admiral Moore, saying it was an inside job, you know, they don't want to admit
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.400]  they've been totally disproven. Just like they called us conspiracy theorist on Tonkin,
[29:13.400 --> 29:20.400]  wrote books, had TV shows debunking that Tonkin wasn't staged with the destroyers
[29:20.400 --> 29:25.400]  and now it's declassified and the LBJ tapes are released.
[29:25.400 --> 29:29.400]  So, no, they're not going to, people always say, where's the smoking guns?
[29:29.400 --> 29:33.400]  Smoking guns are everywhere. Stay there. I'll have you finish when we get back.
[29:33.400 --> 29:36.400]  Scott and then everybody else that's patiently holding.
[29:36.400 --> 29:41.400]  But yeah, the new JFK information is up on infowars.com.
[29:41.400 --> 29:46.400]  Right now, World Exclusive eHoward Hunt and Tells the JFK plot on video.

[31:59.400 --> 32:02.400]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you?
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.400]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.

[33:25.400 --> 33:32.400]  Look at the criminality you see on the screens of business
[33:32.400 --> 33:37.400]  and just the culture itself being classified by the police.
[33:37.400 --> 33:40.400]  The fish rots from the head.
[33:40.400 --> 33:43.400]  As they say,
[33:43.400 --> 33:59.400]  think of the ridiculous spell, the illusion of the mesmerized public convinced for decades
[33:59.400 --> 34:03.400]  that there was no evil in government.
[34:03.400 --> 34:13.400]  No corruption.
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.400]  The government couldn't tie its shoe laces.
[34:16.400 --> 34:18.400]  There were no powerful interests.
[34:18.400 --> 34:21.400]  Nobody wanted to rule them or dominate them.
[34:21.400 --> 34:23.400]  Nobody wanted to rule the world.
[34:23.400 --> 34:30.400]  Even as they set up their open-world government foreign by the banks,
[34:30.400 --> 34:34.400]  even as with one side of their mouth,
[34:34.400 --> 34:36.400]  they admit they're doing it on the other side, they deny it.
[34:36.400 --> 34:37.400]  Just amazing.
[34:37.400 --> 34:38.400]  Going back to your phone calls.
[34:38.400 --> 34:41.400]  Scott in Arizona, finish up what you were saying.
[34:41.400 --> 34:47.400]  My other question is about the Biden-Pal comments about what's going on.
[34:47.400 --> 34:53.400]  They're talking about a crisis that will happen coming up in the new year.
[34:53.400 --> 34:55.400]  Do you believe that they're just doing fear mongering
[34:55.400 --> 34:57.400]  or do you believe that something will come up before then?
[34:57.400 --> 35:03.400]  Or do you think that that's going to come to pass or is it more fear mongering?
[35:03.400 --> 35:05.400]  I don't know.
[35:05.400 --> 35:12.400]  I knew they were going to launch the 9-11 attack because President Bush's approval rating was plunging.
[35:12.400 --> 35:16.400]  And I knew that their favorite tactic,
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.400]  they've been preparing the public saying terrorists are going to strike.
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.400]  When they strike, we're going to take all your freedoms away to keep you safe.
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.400]  And then they introduced bin Laden on TV and said he's about to get you.
[35:28.400 --> 35:35.400]  And there were hundreds of other points and things I saw as they were preparing the public like we're children.
[35:35.400 --> 35:38.400]  And I do see them preparing the public again.
[35:38.400 --> 35:44.400]  The problem is they have done it so much in the last seven years since they staged the 9-11 attacks.
[35:44.400 --> 35:52.400]  Seven years plus that there's really no telling what they're going to do.
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.400]  I mean, the economic crisis is an economic 9-11.
[35:56.400 --> 35:58.400]  It could be a military strike.
[35:58.400 --> 36:06.400]  I mean, out of the blue one morning you wake up and U.S.-backed, NATO-Israel-backed proxy, Georgia,
[36:06.400 --> 36:17.400]  sneak attacks, Russian-held areas, international controlled zones, sneak attack, NATO peacekeepers, kill them.
[36:17.400 --> 36:25.400]  I mean, they had Georgian peacekeepers in with the U.N. slash NATO slash Russian contingent, killing them.
[36:25.400 --> 36:29.400]  At point-blank range, I mean, just unbelievable sneak attack.
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.400]  I mean, you know, even high intensity with artillery bombardments, but it started with low intensity,
[36:35.400 --> 36:39.400]  you know, point-blank commando type attack.
[36:39.400 --> 36:42.400]  I mean, that's just as dirty as it gets.
[36:42.400 --> 36:49.400]  And then they had such disdain for the American people and the people of the world that our media put the Georgian
[36:49.400 --> 36:52.400]  puppet president on TV saying, we've been snuck attack.
[36:52.400 --> 36:53.400]  Help us, help us.
[36:53.400 --> 36:55.400]  We're being snuck attack by Russia.
[36:55.400 --> 36:57.400]  And of course, I'm not saying Russia's good.
[36:57.400 --> 36:59.400]  Putin and the new president are obviously corrupt.
[36:59.400 --> 37:02.400]  I mean, that's the nature of power.
[37:02.400 --> 37:09.400]  99% of the time, and Russia's, I'm not saying, you know, run by angels and they kill a lot of media people
[37:09.400 --> 37:11.400]  and there's lots of corruption.
[37:11.400 --> 37:16.400]  I think that the elite we've got in the West, the Anglo-American establishment, I mean, these are reckless people.
[37:16.400 --> 37:22.400]  They launch huge Hollywood style terror attacks that kill 3,000 people.
[37:22.400 --> 37:23.400]  That's spectacular.
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.400]  You know, designed for media with just event after event after event the same day to get maximum coverage.
[37:29.400 --> 37:33.400]  They said close to 4 billion people were able to tune in.
[37:33.400 --> 37:40.400]  And then they launched preemptive attacks on Iraq and Afghanistan and all the bold things they've done here
[37:40.400 --> 37:43.400]  and the bold sneak attack on Russia.
[37:43.400 --> 37:45.400]  I mean, just the skies the limit with these people.
[37:45.400 --> 37:54.400]  They're geared up for bio attacks that they'll undoubtedly in the future release to train us to have a controlled society.
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.400]  I mean, and people don't want to hear this.
[37:56.400 --> 37:57.400]  They're like, oh, that's scary.
[37:57.400 --> 37:58.400]  I don't want to hear it.
[37:58.400 --> 38:01.400]  They're the ones saying it's going to happen and we know they're the ones that have done it over and over again.
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.400]  There's no doubt that the White House sent the anthrax letters.
[38:05.400 --> 38:11.400]  There's no doubt that they're fear mongering saying we're going to be attacked by bio weapons, chemical weapons, radiological weapons.
[38:11.400 --> 38:14.400]  There's no doubt they've got the will to do it.
[38:14.400 --> 38:17.400]  It gets some more power and control to them.
[38:17.400 --> 38:18.400]  It's just collateral damage.
[38:18.400 --> 38:22.400]  It's a military mindset, a very corrupt one.
[38:22.400 --> 38:24.400]  And so just God help us.
[38:24.400 --> 38:34.400]  These people are giving us no quarter and they've got a public that knows they're being lied to now but just can't face the horror that the elite is really this bad.
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.400]  That it's not a boss hog corruption.
[38:37.400 --> 38:40.400]  I mean, I'd pray for a boss hog corruption compared to this.
[38:40.400 --> 38:48.400]  Just looting and stealing and, you know, doing old fashioned stuff that government does and that's bad, but that's to almost be expected in history.
[38:48.400 --> 39:00.400]  But to have a hardcore scientific, focused, vicious system, you know, that puts out these George Bush puppets and Bill Clinton puppets and Barack Obama puppets and the public thinks they actually run something.
[39:00.400 --> 39:09.400]  And it all becomes about the personality and Saturday Night Live making jokes about them and, oh, the leaders are just idiots and, you know, the environmentalists are just morons.
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.400]  Well, yeah, they take your farmer ranch.
[39:10.400 --> 39:11.400]  They're on morons.
[39:11.400 --> 39:12.400]  They're businessmen.
[39:12.400 --> 39:15.400]  They're raiders who use it as a cover to steal your property.
[39:15.400 --> 39:20.400]  I mean, in all the genetic engineering and then what's doing to the environment, that's being ignored.
[39:20.400 --> 39:29.400]  And all these environmental zombies, you know, wanting to grab property and tax, human respiration, it's just unspeakable.
[39:29.400 --> 39:30.400]  It's just all of it.
[39:30.400 --> 39:35.400]  It's a nightmare.
[39:35.400 --> 39:37.400]  I appreciate your call, Scott.
[39:37.400 --> 39:39.400]  I'm not trying to even be negative here.
[39:39.400 --> 39:41.400]  You know, people say, well, we'll be positive.
[39:41.400 --> 39:43.400]  Tell us the good stuff that's out.
[39:43.400 --> 39:45.400]  If I don't, look, I'm using analogy.
[39:45.400 --> 39:48.400]  I'll use it again.
[39:48.400 --> 39:57.400]  Imagine seeing your neighbor's house, your dog's barking at 2 a.m. in the morning, your dog's barking.
[39:57.400 --> 40:04.400]  And you go and look out the window and you see flames coming out of the attic of your neighbor's house.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.400]  And you run out front.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.400]  You wait for a second.
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.400]  You're on your cordless phone.
[40:07.400 --> 40:08.400]  You call 911.
[40:08.400 --> 40:13.400]  Some other neighbors are walking out in their pajamas and their bath robes.
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.400]  And you see smoke start coming out of, you know, now the top floor of the two-story house.
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.400]  And a couple minutes have gone by and you notice there's a couple lights on the house.
[40:22.400 --> 40:28.400]  You go bang on the door and somebody comes to the door with a nightcap on rubbing their eyes.
[40:28.400 --> 40:29.400]  And you say, hey, your house on fire.
[40:29.400 --> 40:30.400]  Get out.
[40:30.400 --> 40:31.400]  Get out.
[40:31.400 --> 40:32.400]  You know, get your family, your children, get your animals out.
[40:32.400 --> 40:34.400]  And they say, hey, be positive.
[40:34.400 --> 40:36.400]  Well, why are you being so negative?
[40:36.400 --> 40:37.400]  And you're like, no, no.
[40:37.400 --> 40:39.400]  Look, I mean, look, they're smoking your house.
[40:39.400 --> 40:40.400]  Don't you know it's on fire?
[40:40.400 --> 40:41.400]  Get out of there.
[40:41.400 --> 40:44.400]  And they're like, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[40:44.400 --> 40:47.400]  No, I'm just going to think positive and I'm going to go back and get back in bed.
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.400]  And in fact, please don't wake me up again or I'll call the police on you.
[40:51.400 --> 40:53.400]  And you're like, no, no, no, please.
[40:53.400 --> 40:55.400]  Your house is on fire.
[40:55.400 --> 40:58.400]  And so you say, well, I'm not going to stand here and let this happen.
[40:58.400 --> 41:01.400]  Now, most Americans have been conditioned to stand by nowadays.
[41:01.400 --> 41:10.400]  But I mean, my neighbor was acting this psychopathic and was this mesmerized or hypnotized by whatever to not come out of the house.
[41:10.400 --> 41:19.400]  I'd go ahead and if they slammed the door in my face, I'd kick it down and start physically grabbing them and trying to get the house clear.
[41:19.400 --> 41:25.400]  And then imagine in this corrupt system, the police and fire department pull up and they would come up and tase me and say, oh, he's insane.
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.400]  Send him to the mental institution as the house collapses down and burns the family to death.
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.400]  I mean, everything we're talking about documented, admitted on the record.
[41:36.400 --> 41:39.400]  And we have our own movement in denial.
[41:39.400 --> 41:48.400]  I was sent a YouTube video last night and in my email and I clicked on it about midnight.
[41:48.400 --> 41:50.400]  And it was our...
[41:50.400 --> 42:01.400]  And I was reading the comments and I followed them back and it was, quote, other patriots, other truth tellers saying, oh, Alex Jones, you know, he's a David Ike nut now.
[42:01.400 --> 42:06.400]  Look at him making stuff up about goblin people.
[42:06.400 --> 42:17.400]  Now, I was reading what was in a bunch of British newspapers and it had the quote by the scientists saying humans are splitting into two different species.
[42:17.400 --> 42:24.400]  You know, this tall blonde-haired blue-eyed Superman and these little goblin-like creatures.
[42:24.400 --> 42:32.400]  But the person took the clip and said, oh, look, he's making it up that there's goblin people.
[42:32.400 --> 42:33.400]  He's insane.
[42:33.400 --> 42:35.400]  That's why they only play about 10 seconds of the clip.
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.400]  But it wasn't the individual that was criticizing me.
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.400]  I mean, I understood that.
[42:43.400 --> 42:44.400]  I didn't mind it.
[42:44.400 --> 42:45.400]  I knew what they were doing.
[42:45.400 --> 42:47.400]  It was clear.
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.400]  It was that the person that even sent me the email was saying, man, look at you.
[42:51.400 --> 42:59.400]  You know, I used to listen to you, but you're clearly a nut just putting out this info now.
[42:59.400 --> 43:06.400]  In fact, let me just go to Google right now and illustrate this.
[43:06.400 --> 43:24.400]  Humans are splitting into two species, humans to split into two species.
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.400]  I spelled it so bad Google can't even.
[43:29.400 --> 43:30.400]  Oh, I didn't put space in there.
[43:30.400 --> 43:32.400]  That's the problem.
[43:32.400 --> 43:33.400]  Humans.
[43:33.400 --> 43:35.400]  There we go.
[43:35.400 --> 43:37.400]  That's not coming up.
[43:37.400 --> 43:40.400]  I found it last night when I was looking for it.
[43:40.400 --> 43:43.400]  Let me Google goblin-like creature.
[43:43.400 --> 43:52.400]  Goblin-like creature.
[43:52.400 --> 43:54.400]  Well, the point is I'll find the article.
[43:54.400 --> 43:57.400]  It's hard to do while I'm here talking on air.
[43:57.400 --> 44:05.400]  But if you type in humanity, I think it's the headline to split into two different species.
[44:05.400 --> 44:14.400]  When the scientific report came out by a prestigious institution, it was in a whole bunch of newspapers.
[44:14.400 --> 44:21.400]  You know, that's just like if I, well, I still have people emailing me saying, you're lying.
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.400]  There's no such thing as part human, part animal clones.
[44:26.400 --> 44:36.400]  And I remember 10 years ago, yeah, it was about, no, it was more than, it was 1997, seeing BBC headlines
[44:36.400 --> 44:44.400]  about how they'd already created animal human clones, but they had just terminated them in the embryonic phase.
[44:44.400 --> 44:47.400]  And of course, obviously, that's just what they're publicly saying.
[44:47.400 --> 44:52.400]  And I've told the stories of people coming up to me on the street one time in a restaurant.
[44:52.400 --> 44:57.400]  The guy tapping on the shoulder, I was picking up a pizza and he said, I used to listen to you, but now I know you're a liar.
[44:57.400 --> 45:00.400]  There's no such thing as part goat, part spiders.
[45:00.400 --> 45:02.400]  And I said, well, it's CBS News.
[45:02.400 --> 45:04.400]  I had the head of the company on it.
[45:04.400 --> 45:05.400]  He said, no, you're a liar.
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.400]  And I'm calling you out as a liar.
[45:07.400 --> 45:09.400]  I said, fine, I'm a liar.
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.400]  I mean, there are spider goats.
[45:12.400 --> 45:19.400]  There are human pig, human cow clones.
[45:19.400 --> 45:22.400]  I mean, I actually have a news article about that today.
[45:22.400 --> 45:23.400]  Where is it?
[45:23.400 --> 45:29.400]  This is Agency French Press Lawmakers Back Animal Human Embryo Research.
[45:29.400 --> 45:38.400]  The Lower House of Parliament approved legislation Wednesday allowing scientists to create animal human embryos for medical research in the biggest shakeup of embryo laws in two decades.
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.400]  I mean, they were doing this in England and the U.S. at least 10 years ago.
[45:42.400 --> 45:52.400]  The spot opposition from religious and pro-life groups, members of parliament in the House of Commons, backed the Human Embryology and Fertilization Bill 355, votes to 129.
[45:52.400 --> 45:56.400]  It will now go to the House of Lords and could be law by November.
[45:56.400 --> 45:58.400]  You see, mind the trackers don't care.
[45:58.400 --> 46:07.400]  They'll just cut out me talking about goblin creatures, human cow creatures, and then just say, look at how he's insane.
[46:07.400 --> 46:11.400]  But then people in our quote, own awakening movement will say, yeah, Alex is making it up.
[46:11.400 --> 46:13.400]  I'm not making anything up.
[46:13.400 --> 46:15.400]  I'm not making any of it up.
[46:15.400 --> 46:16.400]  None of it up.
[46:16.400 --> 46:17.400]  And you ignore it.
[46:17.400 --> 46:20.400]  It's your own peril.
[46:20.400 --> 46:22.400]  And I'm sick of the denial.
[46:22.400 --> 46:24.400]  I am tired of it.
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.400]  I've had enough of it.
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.400]  I really have.
[46:32.400 --> 46:34.400]  I mean, denial has been bred into us.
[46:34.400 --> 46:36.400]  And I don't even know what to say.
[46:36.400 --> 46:39.400]  I got a hurry because I got a guest come up and I want to get to your calls.
[46:39.400 --> 46:42.400]  Randy in LA, go ahead.
[46:42.400 --> 46:44.400]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[46:44.400 --> 46:45.400]  Good, my friend.
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.400]  Well, I'm calling today because I've been following the case of a Berg versus Obama.
[46:49.400 --> 46:59.400]  And I think it's taking some very interesting turns of late with the Obama camp unable to or not replying in time to Berg's allegations that Obama was born in Kenya,
[46:59.400 --> 47:02.400]  which is a de facto admission of the charges.
[47:02.400 --> 47:05.400]  So what is your take on where this whole case is going?
[47:05.400 --> 47:09.400]  I know, of course, he's in Hawaii right now checking into it.
[47:09.400 --> 47:11.400]  I'm going to get him on in the next few days.
[47:11.400 --> 47:13.400]  And you know what?
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.400]  That isn't even the reason that Obama's bad.
[47:17.400 --> 47:20.400]  He's bad because both the candidates are controlled by the New World Order.
[47:20.400 --> 47:26.400]  But he's gotten three times the Wall Street money, four times the Goldman Sachs money that McCain's got.
[47:26.400 --> 47:27.400]  That's all you need to know.
[47:27.400 --> 47:33.400]  They ran that chipmunk nut.
[47:33.400 --> 47:35.400]  Oh, the Albino chipmunk?
[47:35.400 --> 47:36.400]  Yes, against.
[47:36.400 --> 47:37.400]  And I don't know what they mean to Albino.
[47:37.400 --> 47:39.400]  The point is, I got pretty white skin myself.
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.400]  The point is, is that they are running him like they ran Bob Dole against Clinton in 1996.
[47:45.400 --> 47:47.400]  He is meant to lose.
[47:47.400 --> 47:49.400]  But hey, the public isn't going to believe it.
[47:49.400 --> 47:50.400]  They got to find out.
[47:50.400 --> 47:54.400]  And then by the time they figure out they've been taken for a ride by Barack Obama,
[47:54.400 --> 47:57.400]  there'll be a new Republican savior for them.
[47:57.400 --> 48:00.400]  And then when they figure out they're being taken for a ride there,
[48:00.400 --> 48:03.400]  and you know, now I'm a right-wing fascist because I don't like Obama.
[48:03.400 --> 48:09.400]  And just a few months ago, I was a hardcore commie according to the neocons that didn't like Bush.
[48:09.400 --> 48:11.400]  And it's just how it goes.
[48:11.400 --> 48:14.400]  So for four to eight years, I'm now going to be a right-wing fascist.
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.400]  And then in four to eight years, when it's a Republican, I'll be a commie again.
[48:18.400 --> 48:21.400]  You know, it's just the public's got to learn.
[48:21.400 --> 48:25.400]  But the good news is, in the past, they were fooled by the left-right bait and switch.
[48:25.400 --> 48:32.400]  When Congress has got an 11% approval rating in these polls, it's only about 60% saying they're going to vote for either candidate.
[48:32.400 --> 48:36.400]  So that's like 30-something for Obama and 20-something for McCain.
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.400]  I mean, neither one of them have a majority support out there.
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.400]  So the good news is, the people know they're just hoping things get better with Obama.
[48:44.400 --> 48:47.400]  And I got news for you. You're going to see change, folks.
[48:47.400 --> 48:49.400]  It's going to get real bad. It's going to get a lot worse.
[48:49.400 --> 48:51.400]  So just get ready.
[48:51.400 --> 48:53.400]  Anything else?
[48:53.400 --> 48:58.400]  So that's it, Alex. And I have to agree, the people do seem to know I've been posting this question on Yahoo Answers.
[48:58.400 --> 49:03.400]  And so far, I see about one in eight are saying, yeah, this definitely needs to be looked into further.
[49:03.400 --> 49:09.400]  All right, my friends. Kevin in Missouri, you're on the air.
[49:09.400 --> 49:13.400]  Hey, how's it going? I was actually calling about the burden case as well.
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.400]  I wanted to follow up on it with a slightly different view.
[49:17.400 --> 49:24.400]  The judge, Obama, none of them answered the questions. A lot of the separate experts have looked at the certificate of birth.
[49:24.400 --> 49:27.400]  It clearly looks like it's been falsified.
[49:27.400 --> 49:30.400]  But I mean, it's not just that. I mean, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[49:30.400 --> 49:36.400]  This guy, and I'm not bashing Muslims or people with foreign names, but I mean, if his name was, you know,
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.400]  David Jones or Tom Jones, he was a black guy and his family been here for 100 years, 200 years.
[49:41.400 --> 49:43.400]  People would trust him a lot more.
[49:43.400 --> 49:47.400]  I mean, I don't trust Schwarzenegger because, you know, he's a foreigner. His daddy was a Nazi.
[49:47.400 --> 49:53.400]  And I made a film about that. I got emails saying you're anti-German when I'm, you know, half Germanic.
[49:53.400 --> 49:59.400]  But the point is, Alsatian and German, as a French, German and German on both sides of my mother's family.
[49:59.400 --> 50:05.400]  But I mean, you know, I'm against Schwarzenegger and because, you know, questionable ties.
[50:05.400 --> 50:09.400]  And I'm definitely against Obama because, I mean, the guy did have a foreign daddy.
[50:09.400 --> 50:13.400]  His mom, he was a commie. I mean, flat-out communists, the guys surrounded by them.
[50:13.400 --> 50:17.400]  Communists killed over 150 million people last century.
[50:17.400 --> 50:21.400]  But he's not some commie plant, folks. He's a foundation banker plant.
[50:21.400 --> 50:25.400]  That's why you got communists and bankers always thick as thieves. Go ahead.
[50:25.400 --> 50:29.400]  My concern was kind of with the Constitution.
[50:29.400 --> 50:36.400]  You know, if this gets through, it'll, it seems like it'll kind of circumvent the Constitution without due process of law
[50:36.400 --> 50:39.400]  by allowing a foreigner to become president.
[50:39.400 --> 50:45.400]  And I was wondering, you know, if that happens, do you think that will go through, like,
[50:45.400 --> 50:50.400]  where that'll almost be like a commonality where foreigners can be elected president?
[50:50.400 --> 50:55.400]  Well, no, the Schwarzenegger is saying Palin can't be vice president or president.
[50:55.400 --> 51:00.400]  See, that's another little tip-off. Schwarzenegger is basically going for Obama.
[51:00.400 --> 51:06.400]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[51:06.400 --> 51:11.400]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[51:11.400 --> 51:16.400]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings. Walk on well that pass with friends or students.
[51:16.400 --> 51:19.400]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[51:19.400 --> 51:21.400]  Know how to reach campus security.
[51:21.400 --> 51:24.400]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[51:24.400 --> 51:27.400]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[52:00.400 --> 52:07.400]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:07.400 --> 52:11.400]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:11.400 --> 52:13.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[52:13.400 --> 52:16.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:16.400 --> 52:23.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:23.400 --> 52:30.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.400 --> 52:39.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.400]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[52:44.400 --> 52:48.400]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[53:00.400 --> 53:05.400]  Question. Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[53:05.400 --> 53:10.400]  Worse. The world economic collapse could come any day.
[53:10.400 --> 53:15.400]  Question. Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[53:15.400 --> 53:21.400]  Question. Do you have 7 years of healthy food for your family?

[54:00.400 --> 54:23.400]  I wish your butt was still silver. It was back when the country was wrong.
[54:23.400 --> 54:35.400]  Back before Elvis and before Vietnam War came along.
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.400]  Before the Beatles and yesterday.
[54:41.400 --> 54:50.400]  When a man that still worked, still would.
[54:50.400 --> 54:55.400]  It's the best of the free life behind us now.
[54:55.400 --> 55:04.400]  And are there good times really over for good?
[55:04.400 --> 55:16.400]  And are we rolling downhill like the snowball headed for hell?
[55:16.400 --> 55:22.400]  With no kind of chance at all, the flag of the river didn't fell.
[55:22.400 --> 55:24.400]  I like the end of the song.
[55:24.400 --> 55:30.400]  Stop rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[55:30.400 --> 55:36.400]  We'll still last 10 years like it should.
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.400]  Good times is the best of the free life behind us now.
[55:40.400 --> 55:44.400]  Let's go ahead here and talk to Mike in Florida. You're on the air, Mike.
[55:44.400 --> 55:51.400]  Hi, Alex. First-time caller, long-time listener for the Planet.tv member, military veteran.
[55:51.400 --> 55:53.400]  Thank you.
[55:53.400 --> 55:56.400]  I'm referencing E. Howard Hunt's...
[55:56.400 --> 55:59.400]  Thank you so much for putting this out. It's unbelievable.
[55:59.400 --> 56:02.400]  I have to reference the television show, The X-Files, in the episode,
[56:02.400 --> 56:07.400]  Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man, when the person that was called to take out Kennedy,
[56:07.400 --> 56:09.400]  sitting in the waiting room, they referenced him and say,
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.400]  All right, you can go in now, Mr. Hunt. I believe the referencing him as he was the one
[56:14.400 --> 56:17.400]  that was in the sewer that pulled the trigger. I don't know that to be true.
[56:17.400 --> 56:20.400]  Well, do you know where the CIA recruited E. Howard Hunt?
[56:20.400 --> 56:22.400]  No, I don't.
[56:22.400 --> 56:30.400]  He was OSS when there was a secret war in China before the war even got fully declared,
[56:30.400 --> 56:39.400]  and he was a top sniper in World War II against the Japanese in China.
[56:39.400 --> 56:44.400]  So he was OSS, and then he was OSS at the end of the war in Germany,
[56:44.400 --> 56:46.400]  helping bring in Nazis.
[56:46.400 --> 56:48.400]  Operation Paperclip.
[56:48.400 --> 56:51.400]  Yeah, I mean, the guy was there from the ground floor.
[56:51.400 --> 56:58.400]  So, yes, he is a black-op commander who started out in the field sniping...
[56:58.400 --> 57:02.400]  It's classified how many confirmed kills he had, but yes, top sniper.
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.400]  Right on. And just real quick, the series, the X-Files,
[57:07.400 --> 57:09.400]  how relevant do you believe that show is?
[57:09.400 --> 57:11.400]  I'm wondering where they got most of that information from,
[57:11.400 --> 57:15.400]  because most of the show was really before the internet got huge in the early 90s,
[57:15.400 --> 57:20.400]  94, 95 when Operation Paperclip was one of the episodes on the X-Files.
[57:20.400 --> 57:25.400]  Well, what they do is they mix Operation Paperclip and GMO, deadly sunflowers,
[57:25.400 --> 57:30.400]  all this real stuff with purple-green pusshead aliens and worm creatures
[57:30.400 --> 57:36.400]  and devil cults and chubacabras, and so then it kind of discredits the whole thing.
[57:36.400 --> 57:39.400]  But I've talked to several people high-level with the X-Files,
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.400]  one of them on Air Dean Haglin, who was also not just a star in X-Files,
[57:43.400 --> 57:47.400]  but also a star with a lone gun and a spinoff,
[57:47.400 --> 57:52.400]  and I got a call a couple years ago,
[57:52.400 --> 57:56.400]  and most people have already heard the story, but you may not have your asking a question.
[57:56.400 --> 58:00.400]  And I got a call and it's,
[58:00.400 --> 58:06.400]  Hi, this is Dean Haglin. I was given your number by a radio producer I was a guest on,
[58:06.400 --> 58:12.400]  KLBJ93.7, and I told him I'm a fan of you and I'd like to talk to you.
[58:12.400 --> 58:17.400]  Can I come by and see you? I'm coming to town next week.
[58:17.400 --> 58:22.400]  I got to come to town, what for? I'm coming to town to see you. And I said, okay,
[58:22.400 --> 58:25.400]  and I called the producer and talked to him, oh yeah, that's really Dean Haglin.
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.400]  I was like, wow, he's using quite a few movies and other things.
[58:28.400 --> 58:30.400]  And so when we get back all briefly, when we start the next hour,
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.400]  then we'll get Robert Groden on at the 8 after John.
[58:34.400 --> 58:40.400]  I'll come back, so stay there, Mike in Florida.
[58:40.400 --> 58:50.400]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.400 --> 58:55.400]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[58:55.400 --> 58:58.400]  9-11 was an inside job.
[58:58.400 --> 59:01.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[59:01.400 --> 59:04.400]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[59:04.400 --> 59:10.400]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[59:10.400 --> 59:17.400]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:17.400 --> 59:23.400]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:23.400 --> 59:27.400]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:27.400 --> 59:33.400]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:33.400 --> 59:36.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:36.400 --> 59:42.400]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[59:42.400 --> 59:48.400]  Please rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:48.400 --> 1:00:04.400]  It's time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:00:18.400 --> 1:00:22.400]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:31.400]  All right, we have probably the most informed individual from the day one when Kennedy was killed.
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:36.400]  He was involved in smuggling out the Reuter film coming up.
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:40.400]  Robert Broden for about two hours.
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:46.400]  We may have a surprise guest in the fourth hour today, but regardless of taking your calls all day, covering the news.
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:49.400]  Finishing up with Mike in Florida.
[1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:53.400]  I was telling the story, he was saying, you know, the X-Files had so much stuff that's really happened.
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:57.400]  So many real things like getting the Nazis into the U.S. Operation Paperclip.
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:00.400]  I was talking about how they were doing that as disinformation.
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:07.400]  Try to integrate tubercobras and space aliens and things that can't be proven and probably aren't real in the case of tubercobras.
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:09.400]  And with real things, that is credit signal.
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:16.400]  But Dean Haglin calls, wants to talk to me and the star about the TV shows, one of the stars, shows up and says, listen,
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:19.400]  in the video interview I did at my house is up on prisonplanet.tv.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:21.400]  It's also all over the web.
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:22.400]  Then later we had him in studio.
[1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:27.400]  He came back a year later in the studio where I sit.
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:37.400]  And he had seen my report about how the first episode of the lone government, the new X-Files series, six months before 9-11,
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:44.400]  a criminal group inside the Pentagon and defense contractors hijacked a jumbo jet by remote control, the flight of the World Trade Center.
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:48.400]  They use a drill of hijacked jets flying into the tower to make Norratch stand down.
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:56.400]  They're going to blame it on Afghan rebels so they can smart bomb them and start World War III and have arms sales and invade them at least in Central Asia.
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:03.400]  Now, I mean, how would you make a report, make a movie where it basically exactly what happened happened?
[1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:08.400]  Now, that blew him away and he said, listen, I talked to Chris Carter and others,
[1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:12.400]  and the CIA and NASA and others would come to him and say, hey, here's a script.
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:13.400]  Here's an idea.
[1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:15.400]  We'd like to see you incorporate this.
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:19.400]  And he wouldn't go any further than that.
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:22.400]  And believe me, he was scared.
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:26.400]  So I had that directly from the horse's mouth, directly.
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:28.400]  And you heard and saw it on air.
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:30.400]  Again, just amazing.
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:39.400]  So this is called predictive programming, where they show you something so your subconscious is ready to accept it when it happens.
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:43.400]  And it's just unbelievable.
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:45.400]  Anything else, Mike?
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.400]  No, that pretty much does it.
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:53.400]  But Alex, I really want to thank you and everyone else out there that has woken up and a quote from the cigarette smoky man in the X-Files.
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:55.400]  People need to think about this.
[1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:58.400]  He said, ease a man's conscience and you can take his freedom.
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.400]  But people wake up and thank you very much, Alex.
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:02.400]  That's right.
[1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:03.400]  They tell us it's OK.
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:04.400]  Lay down.
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:05.400]  The government's not bad.
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:06.400]  They're just stupid.
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:11.400]  And again, I was sent an email with a video clip of myself taking out a context, making fun of me.
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:18.400]  And I don't care about our enemies who added me together to say things like, I hate America.
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:25.400]  When I was singing a fictional song by the New World Order, exposing how they hate America.
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:34.400]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff they do, but this latest one is that I saw people in the Quilt Patriot movement seizing on anything to attack me.
[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:36.400]  Oh, look, Alex is making up goblin people.
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:41.400]  When I sat on there, the BBC is reporting that human species may split into two.
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:43.400]  That's the headline, BBC.
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:44.400]  And I pulled it up.
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:45.400]  There it is, BBC.
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:58.400]  October 17, 2006, evolutionary theorist Oliver Curry, the London School of Economics, expects a genetic upper class and a dim-witted underclass to emerge.
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:05.400]  People would become choosier about their sexual partners, causing humanity to delve and divide into two subspecies, he added.
[1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:14.400]  The sentence of the genetic upper class would be tall, slim, healthy, attractive, intelligent, and creative and far cry from the underclass humans who would have evolved into a dim-witted, ugly, squat, goblin-like creature.
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:19.400]  And then it shows an artist rendering of the superhumans versus the goblin creature.
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:24.400]  I have to say, a lot of the public actually looks like the goblin creature now, from McDonald's and the rest of it.
[1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:32.400]  But, and then I was saying, that all comes from H.G. Wells and other futurist and theorist in nonfiction books they wrote.
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:35.400]  I mean, they all talk like that.
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:38.400]  The Darwin's, they already believe they're two species from interbreeding.
[1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:46.400]  And then that's mainline eugenics and just a whole bunch of other scientists and writers.
[1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:49.400]  I mean, that's what the elite believes. And then that's what I was reporting.
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:05:00.400]  Okay, so whatever makeup you want, I just want our good people out there listening to understand the type of perceptions that are being worked out there against us.
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:08.400]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:12.400]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:14.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:17.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:24.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:31.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:42.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:45.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:53.400]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:47.400]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio. It's a question of when.

[1:07:00.400 --> 1:07:05.400]  Phase 1 of the Insider's Plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:12.400]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:14.400]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:22.400]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times. Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:26.400]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:31.400]  Phase 1 is a one world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:35.400]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.

[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:22.400]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:38.400]  Alright, he doesn't like talking about himself, but I'm going to make him talk about himself so you understand the magnitude of the depth and breadth of knowledge that he has.
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:48.400]  I mean, there's no one living than I know who's been this close to the case. He was the chief advisor and researcher on the film JFK.
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:09:00.400]  Just an amazing individual, Robert J. Groden. And I think it's important for him to tell you where he was the day it happened, how he got involved, what he saw.
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:12.400]  He even has some other evidence that is no secret of the government he has, and it'll be out in the new book he's making. I would be scared to death to even have this. I've seen it.
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:30.400]  Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And then we have the funeral director who's going to be in my new film. He lives here in Austin. He's a very wealthy guy.
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:36.400]  He ended up building a whole chain of funeral homes across the country.
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:45.400]  And we interviewed him here in studio. We're going to interview him the next week and he got run off the road and almost killed an hour before we were going to interview him at his house.
[1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:54.400]  I'm not saying that was the government, but St. John Hunt out on a lonely road had a car come up and basically bump his bumper, pull around and try to run him off the cliffs in Northern California.
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:01.400]  He got home. His whole house was torn apart, papers stolen, everything rifled through. Nothing taken but papers.
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:11.400]  I mean, you get around this Kennedy thing. It's like when I covered Bilderberg this year and we got death threats and women calling up saying I'd gotten them pregnant to my wife and dirty tricks.
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:22.400]  I mean, that's when you know how real this is. So getting into this JFK thing, I've always had guest on and covered, but making a film and really getting into it.
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:33.400]  45 years later, they are still all over it to protect the system because the sons and grandsons and some of the still living people involved are alive and in the power structure.
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:44.400]  And I think Bruce Willis said it best after he woke up from seeing my films. He told Vanity Fair that the same people that killed Kennedy are the ones running the shadow government and running things in 911 today.
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.400]  Yeah, we woke up Bruce Willis. That's exciting.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:54.400]  So for the next two hours, Robert Groden is our guest. And Robert, let's take it slow. Let's talk about who you are.
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:59.400]  I mean, you're the guy that got the Subruder film leaked and so much more.
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:05.400]  At great risk to yourself, a secret agent for liberty and freedom, now public. And we're just honored to have you.
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:13.400]  So spend about the first 10 minutes on yourself and where you've testified and just the whole saga. It's just amazing.
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:32.400]  Well, except my interest in the Kennedy case started the day it happened. It was my 18th birthday that day and I somehow felt connected to it that way and started researching it and investigating everything that was available about it from the beginning.
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:52.400]  And in 1969, through absolute luck, there was no magic powers involved in this thing. I actually got to work on the original Zapgruder film and was able to blow it up from 8mm to 35mm
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:12:05.400]  and then to use different techniques on the film to steady it, to stabilize the image, slow it down so that the eye could comprehend what was in it.
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:15.400]  And I kept very quiet about it because it was very plain for anybody to see who would see the film that the shot came from the front,
[1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:26.400]  struck the president in the right temple and threw him to the rear. So I kept quiet about it except to a very select handful of researchers within the research community, the credible ones.
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:35.400]  And I got talked into showing it at Georgetown University in November of 1973 for the 10th anniversary.
[1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:50.400]  And I showed it and there was a big response to it at the time but it remained within that context. And then in February of 1975 I was asked to show it again at Boston University
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:13:01.400]  at a major conference called the Politics of Conspiracy. This time it was picked up as a national news story and it broke the case wide open.
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:06.400]  Within days I was asked to present the evidence before Congress and I did.
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:15.400]  And Congressman Tom Downing of Virginia introduced legislation to reopen the Kennedy case based on what the film to photographic evidence showed.
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:20.400]  He had me named staff photographic consultant to the House of Assassinations Committee.
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:29.400]  That's right, a lot of Americans don't know that the house later found, what they say, 95% sure it was a conspiracy, a government killing.
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:33.400]  I mean the average American doesn't know that the Congress has even found that.
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:42.400]  That's correct. The House Committee ruled that it was a 95% certainty or greater that there was in fact a conspiracy.
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:50.400]  Since then there has been peer review of that evidence and that peer review of the evidence has increased from 95% or greater to 98% or greater.
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.400]  Just to digress because I interrupted but before I forget this.
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:59.400]  What do you think when the Dallas Morning News came out and said, yeah, it's been looked at, the government's even looked at it.
[1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:03.400]  The fragments found in Connolly don't match the bullet.
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:09.400]  I mean on its face this bullet shoots through all this, the car, two different people, all these bones, it isn't damaged.
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:19.400]  I mean it's childish how ridiculous it is than Los Alamos looks at it and says it's a conspiracy and the acoustics show they killed him multiple shots.
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:25.400]  I mean it's incredible but I'm sorry, continue with, you've gotten up to testifying to Congress.
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:38.400]  Well, the first group that I testified to was the Rockefeller Commission and that was back in 1975 and you mentioned E. Howard Hunt.
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:45.400]  I testified in 75 about Hunt's involvement in this decades before all this new stuff came out.
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:52.400]  And the record that I testified about that is available in the National Archives, it does exist.
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:59.400]  And then the next group that I testified to was the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Church Committee.
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:05.400]  And then to the Housework Committee on Assassinations, the same group that I worked for for nearly three years.
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:12.400]  And then the Assassination Records Review Board testified for five full days to them.
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:17.400]  And there absolutely is no question about the fact that there was a conspiracy.
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:23.400]  The question could be raised as to who was involved in that conspiracy, but there certainly was a conspiracy.
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:26.400]  There was more than one shooter. There's no question about that.
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.400]  Sure, but we're going to get into that later because it's very important.
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:37.400]  But I want to first, again, your whole saga, your whole journey, you know, now every week for years down there at the grass, you know, in downtown Dallas.
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:45.400]  I mean, you're probably the most dedicated person because I've really been more deeply studying the JFK assassination intensely for the last years.
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:48.400]  So I'd always looked at it and run a lot of books and read a lot of experts.
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:53.400]  But I mean, it wasn't until I really, more deeply researched it, I realized how prolific and how dedicated you've been.
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:57.400]  So continue with your saga.
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:08.400]  Well, I had been working on the case for my entire adult life from the time I was 18 until about 15 years ago.
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:18.400]  And I became aware that everybody in the Dallas area who had been working on the Kennedy case had died, virtually everyone.
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:22.400]  There was virtually no one left who was doing any credible work.
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:31.400]  And several people who had been involved in the case started selling out to the other side, some for great amounts of money.
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:43.400]  And I made the decision to move down to the Dallas area from Philadelphia and try to pick up where the others had left off.
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:45.400]  Because the other side was winning by default.
[1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:47.400]  There was no one to challenge.
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:58.400]  The Sixth Floor Museum, which now exists in the old Texas schoolbook depository building, their mandate was to present all sides of the issue fairly and equally.
[1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.400]  Well, obviously they have not done that.
[1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:05.400]  They sold out very early on and will only present the Warren Commission side of the story.
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:12.400]  It's absolutely horrendous what they've done, the amount of damage that they've done through the years.
[1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:18.400]  There are people that have for decades been on our side of the issue to try to get the truth out.
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:23.400]  Now you can't get them to admit that there was a conspiracy in spite of all the evidence.
[1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:27.400]  So they present only the Warren Commission side and they were winning by default.
[1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:31.400]  I felt there needed to be a voice of reason on the other side down here.
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:38.400]  So my wife and I made the decision that I would move down here and carry the standard as it will.
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:45.400]  And present the evidence to visitors to Dealey Plaza so that they will know that there is an alternative to the official fiction.
[1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:48.400]  And that's where I've been now for 15 years.
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:51.400]  Is it safe to say you've talked to a million people down there?
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:53.400]  More than that. Certainly more than that.
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:58.400]  But they expect that there's a million visitors a year to Dealey Plaza.
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:00.400]  And I've been there for 15 years.
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:06.400]  Now I've been told they've also tried to harass you and use the police and things to push you off the knoll.
[1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:09.400]  That's absolutely correct. They've thrown me in jail for it.
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:11.400]  I've been arrested.
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:17.400]  I've been ticketed more than 80 times, harassed over 400 times.
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:21.400]  I've been attacked in the Plaza.
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:32.400]  One guy with a knife, one with a baseball bat, one with a heavy stick to try to run me over twice in the parking lot in Dealey Plaza.
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:36.400]  But it goes on and on.
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:40.400]  Obviously, I'm bothering somebody.
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:45.400]  The city manager, the Dallas city manager gave orders to the police to come and arrest me.
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:52.400]  They've sent in Homeland Security with machine guns saying I was a terrorist.
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:56.400]  This has been going on for quite some time.
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:00.400]  And if I wasn't right, that wouldn't be happening.
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:05.400]  It's just incredible.
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:14.400]  And that's when you really know that you're onto something is when you get the threats, the harassment, not just dealing with police harassment.
[1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:18.400]  And then we'll go through all the evidence itself on the case, the physical evidence.
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:22.400]  But I think that some of the strongest evidence is the threats, the harassment, the deaths.
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:25.400]  And I want to talk about those when we get back.
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:30.400]  But have you ever been threatened or how many times have you been threatened?
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:33.400]  Well, I've been threatened quite a bit.
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:38.400]  The phone threats are one thing, but the actual attacks in the Plaza are something else again.
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:44.400]  There was one time when I was in the Plaza and a guy came up with a hunting knife and tried to stab me.
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:48.400]  We stopped him, we caught him, called the police four times.
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:51.400]  They refused to come. We finally had to let him go.
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:54.400]  Yeah, that's how it works. Their people are allowed to do whatever they want.
[1:19:54.400 --> 1:20:00.400]  Dallas is a very wicked city because you got a bunch of delusional, fake Christians running it.
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:02.400]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:04.400]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:06.400]  I can't find my wallet.

[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:41.400]  This is a short segment with long ones coming up. Don't worry we've got our guests for more than an hour and a half.
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:59.400]  A lot to talk about. Robert Groten the guy that got the subredor film out and a lot more. He's not tooting his horn here folks. This guy has frankly contributed more than anybody to exposing it.
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:13.400]  That's when the military industrial complex fully took over the country. Now we've seen all their other exploits. Their fame when it comes to evil. The gangsterism.
[1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:24.400]  We have Robert break down the physical threats, the phone calls, what they're like, what you've gone through. Let me guess, do they like to call your wife up and pretend that they're girlfriends of yours?
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:30.400]  I'm not sure that that ever happened although I suspected that perhaps something like that may have.
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:32.400]  That's a favorite they do to me but go ahead.
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:57.400]  I had a terrific time with the National Enquirer some years ago. When I had moved down here to Texas, the Enquirer called up my wife assuming that there were problems between us and there weren't but they offered her $30,000 to give dirt on me that they could publish and she told them to go to hell.
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:11.400]  I just had the National Geographic doing another 9-11 truth hit piece and they're real sneaky and fake on the phone. They called my wife yesterday and we're like, what's it like living with him? Do you like it?
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:20.400]  It must be interesting trying to get her to talk crap. It's not that I don't want to go on a hit piece because I don't mind. I just don't want to be around the unsavory types.
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:27.400]  It's not that I'm even afraid of being in a hit piece. I think I'm going to just go ahead and do it. It's just that they're just such low-loss but go ahead.
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:47.400]  No, I absolutely agree. They absolutely are. They control the business. They really do. The flow of information gets so muddied and so confusing that people that want to learn the truth have such a hard time trying to work their way through all the garbage that's out there.
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:27:01.400]  They just get tired of it and many walk away. There's a lot of intriguing stuff that sounds good, sounds interesting, but isn't. That just tires people out. It's very, very difficult.
[1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:06.400]  Even researchers in the case that know what they're talking about get confused with some of the things.
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:21.400]  We're going to get into that and from your view, Robert Rowden's unique and well-documented view of what really happened. Let's talk about harassment threats. I think all the murders is, again, more evidence of the fact that it was an inside job. Speak to the murders.
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:40.400]  Well, absolutely. There were a great many people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Good people, disinterested people, bad guys, throughout the spectrum of people, they've died hundreds and hundreds of them.
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:53.400]  Everyone's familiar with the stuff at the end of the movie, Executive Action, where they talk about the first 18 or 19 or 20 people being killed. But that's all we knew about at the time.
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:28:06.400]  We've learned since then that a great, great deal more have actually died because of it. The number now is well over 400. And yes, of course, there's a certain percentage of them that are natural causes.
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:15.400]  There's no question about that. Just because somebody witnessed the Kennedy assassination or was connected in some minor way too, it doesn't mean they're going to live forever.
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:26.400]  But there's a disproportionate number of unsolved homicides, questionable deaths, situations where there should have been autopsies and were not, and now murders.
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:39.400]  One man killed with a karate chop, one shot to death at a police station by a police officer playing quick draw, a woman hung in her jail cell, and on and on and on. It's very, very bizarre.
[1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:49.400]  Some of them are more famous than others. Dorothy Kilgallan, the only reporter who interviewed Jack Ruby from the time he shot Oswald until the time he himself died.
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:57.400]  She's one, Lee Bowers, who was in the railroad tower in the parking lot behind the depository, who saw the assassination take place.
[1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:00.400]  Yeah, saw Hunt and others scurrying around, Sturgis.
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:09.400]  Yeah, absolutely, and knew more than he ever told. He learned early on that the Warren Commission did not want to know what he had to say.
[1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:16.400]  And whenever he started talking about what he saw, they would always lead him away from it. And he said he realized they didn't want to know, so he kept quiet.
[1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:25.400]  But then Jim Garrison was going to call him as a witness in the Shaw trial in New Orleans, and that's where the problems began again because...
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:32.400]  Yeah, you know, we told Barry Jennings and everybody with the 9-11, with the bombs in the buildings, the deputy head of emergency management, we said,
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:47.400]  Buddy, you better spill it all or they're going to kill you. Well, he's dead. And dead men tell no tales, and I just try to tell whistleblowers all the time, you had better spill it all and get it all out, or you are deader than a hammer.
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:51.400]  And they usually don't listen. They get killed. Stay with us.
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:30:01.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:10.400]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents? Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:21.400]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here. Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pure Soaps? They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:07.400]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:31:07.400 --> 1:31:11.400]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:13.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:16.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:23.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:30.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:34.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:41.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:46.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:31:53.400 --> 1:31:57.400]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:06.400]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:11.400]  and she was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices,
[1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:14.400]  this economic uncertainty we're in these, you know, really kind of perilous times.
[1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:16.400]  No one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:21.400]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:24.400]  because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food.
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:27.400]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:30.400]  because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how.
[1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:33.400]  They didn't have the chickens and the livestock. So it was a lot different for them.
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:37.400]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now. We're headed into much higher prices on food
[1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:39.400]  and there is a global food shortage.
[1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:41.400]  Now what can you do to prepare? Do what I did.
[1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:45.400]  Sell some toys off in the garage. Go to the J. Michael Stevens efoodsdirect.com company.
[1:32:45.400 --> 1:32:49.400]  Get some food and put it away and be safe. Put a little security in your life.

[1:32:55.400 --> 1:33:21.400]  Put some food away. Do it now. 1-800-409-5633.
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:27.400]  Robert Broden, the hardest working, most focused JFK researcher.
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:30.400]  The guy that got the Subruder film out.
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:34.400]  Oh, those Kennedy's had blown open like a pumpkin and so much more.
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:42.400]  And you know, you are the expert in all this. You are the master, as they say.
[1:33:42.400 --> 1:33:47.400]  So I've thrown out some of my questions. Let's finish up with all these bizarre deaths
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:52.400]  and murders and the threats and the rest of it, which again is prima facie evidence.
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:55.400]  And then get into all the hard evidence.
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:34:01.400]  I mean, you've won the fight. We've won the fight. 90-plus percent of Americans know they're lying about it.
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:05.400]  And then that's when the shadow government took over, as we can also talk about that.
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:09.400]  But I think people from, you know, from the preeminent expert need to hear what the real evidence is
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:13.400]  and lay it out. So you've got the floor, sir.
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:18.400]  Well, you speak very kindly and I do appreciate that.
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:24.400]  What I would suggest is that the most important evidence that I've been able to develop,
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:30.400]  except for the Subruder film itself, of course, which, you know, stands on its own,
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:36.400]  I interviewed, when I worked for the House of Assassinations Committee as a photographic researcher,
[1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:44.400]  I actually had the opportunity to question and videotape the Dallas doctors
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:51.400]  who had never spoken before or since about what they had seen.
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:56.400]  And they were unanimous that the fatal shot came from the front.
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:04.400]  Whenever the Discovery Channel or the History Channel or any of those people do any of the horrible
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:11.400]  instances for documentaries that they've been showing the last couple of years,
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:16.400]  please notice that they avoid the Dallas doctors like the plague.
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:22.400]  The doctors had nothing to gain, nothing on their own, and my interviews with them,
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.400]  they were absolutely unanimous that the shot came from the right front.
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:31.400]  And these are people who, unfortunately, all except six or seven of them now are all dead.
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:37.400]  The only things I was able to do with them are the only things that captured for history their observations.
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  So I'd say that that is among the most important of all the evidence that's out there.
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:44.400]  These are professional people.
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:47.400]  Now, the other side, the idiots on the other side who say,
[1:35:47.400 --> 1:35:50.400]  well, they weren't forensic pathologists.
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:51.400]  So what?
[1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:55.400]  These are doctors who worked on a daily basis with gunshot wounds,
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:58.400]  knew what they were talking about, and they saw the body.
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:00.400]  They saw the President.
[1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:05.400]  They saw him while he was still breathing for crying out loud.
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:11.400]  How dare the people on the other side, specifically people like Bulliozi and
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:18.400]  Posner and the rest of them, how dare they ignore or pretend to ignore
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:22.400]  the observations of these professional people?
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:24.400]  It's absolutely inexcusable.
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:28.400]  If you watch a documentary and they avoid what the Dallas doctors said,
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:30.400]  it's a dishonest documentary.
[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:31.400]  It's that simple.
[1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:34.400]  There's no easier way to put it.
[1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:40.400]  The idea, for instance, of a single bullet theory that one bullet went through both men,
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:45.400]  Governor Connolly, and then after hitting President Kennedy.
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:50.400]  If you line up the wounds in the President's back and Governor Connolly's back,
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:52.400]  you find that the wound in the President's throat,
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  which was described by everyone who saw it as an entrance wound in the first place,
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:02.400]  but even ignoring that, it's six inches too high to go through a flight path.
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:06.400]  The other side will say, well, we don't have any pictures at the moment of the single bullet,
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:08.400]  so we don't know how high they were sitting.
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:10.400]  That's an absolute lie.
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:16.400]  There's a photograph taken at the exact moment that the single bullet was supposed to have happened,
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:22.400]  and we see exactly how high they were in relationship to each other.
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:27.400]  All of this is all going to be in my new book, which is called JFK Absolute Proof.
[1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:31.400]  Hopefully it should be out within the next couple of months.
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:37.400]  The photographic evidence was basically withheld by the government for decades.
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:40.400]  The Warren Commission released very, very little of it.
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:45.400]  I myself have already released over 1,200, and I'm releasing 800 more in the new book.
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:51.400]  So that's 2,000 photographs that the government tried to ignore or pretend didn't exist.
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:55.400]  The evidence is there, and your audience is a thinking audience.
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:00.400]  They'll be able to tell for themselves, and I'm sure that they're aware of the conspiracy.
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:04.400]  I'm sure that it's no secret to them.
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:06.400]  Well, I mean, continue, continue.
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:07.400]  I mean, you've got the floor.
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:09.400]  I want you to really be able to run, sir.
[1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:10.400]  Oh, my goodness.
[1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:11.400]  Well, let's see.
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:17.400]  How about a two-and-a-half-page document signed by the director of the CIA admitting three things.
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:22.400]  Number one, that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't kill the president, number two, that he worked for the CIA,
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:28.400]  and number three, that he was sent to the Soviet Union on a mission from the United States.
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:34.400]  Signed by the director of the CIA, himself, John McCone, that's out there.
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:36.400]  That exists.
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:38.400]  Let's see what else.
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:46.400]  How about the issue of the president's brain being missing from the National Archives as of 1966
[1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:48.400]  and probably before that?
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:50.400]  Well, we know where the brain is.
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:52.400]  I'm going to reveal that in the new book, too.
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:56.400]  I've got photographs of it.
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:03.400]  The other side just constantly lies to us about what does exist or what doesn't exist.
[1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:06.400]  And the evidence just goes on and on.
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:11.400]  Oh, one thing that's in the new book that you'll find fascinating.
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:19.400]  At the time when Lee Harvey Oswald was taken to Parkland Hospital in the life-saving efforts to try to save his life,
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:25.400]  there were seven roles of film taken of him while he was still breathing and on the operating table.
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:32.400]  Well, these roles of film were not even processed, weren't even developed until last year.
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:36.400]  So Kennedy was one tough cookie.
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:38.400]  The president? Yeah.
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:45.400]  Well, these photographs that exist, there are 85 usable images of Oswald while they were trying to save his life.
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:50.400]  And some of the pictures actually showed the heart monitor showing a good, strong heartbeat.
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:53.400]  He should have survived, but he didn't.
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:55.400]  Yeah, I meant to say I was thinking about Kennedy.
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:59.400]  Obviously, I knew you were talking about Oswald there.
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:05.400]  Because I have on my mind the photos you have that no one's seen of Kennedy on the table.
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:11.400]  Yeah, there are some that, as a matter of fact, there was one photograph I found in the National Archives
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:14.400]  when I was working for the House of Assassinations Committee,
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:19.400]  but to this day is still not in the official inventory.
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:24.400]  It's a series of black and white photographs taken on 120 format film.
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:31.400]  They're all black and white, and they show the president lying on a table from the left side.
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:35.400]  We see him from the left side. Most of the damage he was hit was on the right side.
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:44.400]  But you see him lying there, and this role of film is described in the official inventory as being blank with no image.
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:49.400]  Well, there's at least a half a dozen images on that role of film. They're all pretty much identical.
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:53.400]  And describe that for us, and let's go back to Lee Harvey Oswald because I interrupted.
[1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:57.400]  But I mean, you can describe it, can't you, before the book comes out.
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:02.400]  I think it's dangerous to even have now announced that you've had this at the null so much, and it isn't public.
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:08.400]  I mean, the whole back of the head is just completely blown out, and that contradicts what they officially said.
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:15.400]  Yes, there's a massive hole in the rear of his head hole, just slightly larger than a grown man's fist.
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:18.400]  And that's the way it was described.
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:23.400]  By the way, it looks like they folded the flaps back in, and I disagree. I think it's bigger than a man's fist.
[1:41:23.400 --> 1:41:32.400]  It's just a giant gaping, and you can see, at least when I was allowed to look at it, that they had folded some of the flaps back in.
[1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:40.400]  Well, that may very well be true. What they actually did, what someone within the government did, is they actually took that photograph,
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:46.400]  and they did something called a soft-edge matte insert process.
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:53.400]  To fool the researchers, not the researchers, but the investigators within the case, within the government, who had the ability to see the photographs,
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:56.400]  because they still have not been formally released.
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:03.400]  They actually superimposed the back of somebody else's head to disguise this massive exit hole in the rear of his head.
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:09.400]  Yeah, that's the big issue. You have the fake photos that were put out, and then an artist's renderings, and then you have the real ones.
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:10.400]  That's correct.
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:15.400]  I mean, there's evidence right there. A cover-up, and that's the evidence of the crime right there.
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:17.400]  Absolutely.
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:23.400]  Well, you know, when the House Assassinations Committee was going to begin their investigation, they were going to start from square one,
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:28.400]  start absolutely as an unsolved homicide and work from there.
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:31.400]  And that would have worked. It could have worked.
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:39.400]  But instead, when it was taken over by people with connections to the CIA, and unfortunately that is the truth, that's what happened,
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:48.400]  they dumped that whole aspect of it, started with a preconceived conclusion that Oswald was guilty, and worked from that point.
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:43:01.400]  They ignored the original concept completely, and when you start with that, the way they did it is they took each individual piece of evidence,
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:07.400]  and they weighed that individual piece of evidence against the total weight of the Warren Report.
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:16.400]  If you take each one, and you weigh it, and then see which one weighs more, and throw out each individual piece, then you end up with nothing.
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:24.400]  But if you took all those individual little pieces and weighed them against the Warren Report, all those pieces far outweighed the Warren Report,
[1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:26.400]  but they didn't do it that way.
[1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:32.400]  So they started with the conclusion that Oswald was guilty, and until they got to the acoustics evidence, that's the way they dealt with it.
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:38.400]  The acoustics evidence was so strong on its own that they couldn't hide it anymore.
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:47.400]  They had to admit that there was a conspiracy, but by then they had turned away so much supporting evidence that many people feel that the acoustics evidence was all that they had,
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:49.400]  and that's not true at all.
[1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:53.400]  They had testimony of a man named Robert Knudsen.
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:55.400]  Mr. Knudsen was a photographer.
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:01.400]  He was supposed to be on the trip to Dallas, but he had gotten something into his eye and had to see a doctor,
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:03.400]  so he didn't go.
[1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:13.400]  But he was called into play as an autopsy photographer that evening when the president's body was back there.
[1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:15.400]  He took photographs.
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:20.400]  He was there as a witness, and he saw the angles of the shots.
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:23.400]  He saw the massive wound in the rear of the president's head,
[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:32.400]  and they testified to the House Board Committee on Assassinations that the photographs and evidence now did not represent the president's head as it was that night,
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:34.400]  and they had that, and they buried it.
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:38.400]  The House Committee never even admitted that they even spoke to Robert Knudsen.
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:43.400]  We didn't find out about that until the assassination record review board years and years later.
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:49.400]  Okay, I want to go back as I interrupted you when you were talking about Lee Harvey Oswald still being alive.
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:52.400]  Go back over that and then finish up.
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:59.400]  Okay, Lee Oswald, the official story, one of the official stories we've heard through the years,
[1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:07.400]  is that Lee had died on the way to the hospital, that he never survived, that he was dead on arrival when he got to Parkland,
[1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:12.400]  and they tried, and they tried, and they tried for an hour to try to revive him, and of course they couldn't.
[1:45:12.400 --> 1:45:14.400]  Well, that's not true.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:21.400]  Lee was doing fine as they were controlling much of the bleeding, although there's a lot of damage done.
[1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:27.400]  But the photographs I have of him, he's cut open, he's lying on the table, they're doing heart massage,
[1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:35.400]  they're removing damaged parts of his body, but they also show the heart monitor.
[1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:39.400]  And his heart monitor had a good, strong, solid, steady heartbeat.
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:42.400]  There is no way he should have died.
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:50.400]  And by the way, officially he did not die from the gunshot wound itself per se, but rather from shock.
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:53.400]  As a result of the gunshot wound.
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:58.400]  So, there's a lot of questions as to his dying.
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:06.400]  Of course, by now, almost everyone who's familiar with the Kennedy case is aware that there was a phone call made to the operating room directly
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:16.400]  from President Johnson stating to the doctors that he wanted a confession from Oswald before he died, knowing that he would die,
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.400]  which is very strange.
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:24.400]  Let's talk about Dallas itself, and then, well, finish where we're making now, and then Dallas.
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:30.400]  Because, I mean, Dallas was a heart of CIA, police corruption, I grew up there.
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:37.400]  A perfect place with a kind of brainwashed public believing in mom and apple pie and the government's all loving.
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:44.400]  A very serious cold-blooded police department with connections to the CIA director and others in the department.
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:47.400]  I mean, why Dallas was chosen, but finish up.
[1:46:47.400 --> 1:46:55.400]  Well, why Dallas was chosen was because it was absolutely a hotbed of ultra-right wing fanaticism.
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:01.400]  Lyndon Johnson and others had a great deal of control in Dallas.
[1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:11.400]  It would be much easier to control the investigation and the cover-up here than it would almost anywhere else in the country.
[1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:13.400]  Everybody would cooperate.
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:19.400]  Nobody would argue with the official investigation.
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:22.400]  Which, by the way, let me point that out, too.
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:28.400]  The official investigation historically into the Kennedy assassination was done by the Warren Commission.
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:32.400]  The Warren Commission had absolutely no legal power at all.
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:37.400]  It was the President's commission investigating a local crime.
[1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:40.400]  The death of President Kennedy was not a federal crime.
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:44.400]  It was a local Dallas crime controlled.
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:52.400]  The investigation should have been controlled either by the Dallas District Attorney or by the Texas State Attorney General's office.
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:55.400]  No matter what the Warren Commission did, they could do nothing.
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:58.400]  They had subpoena power, but that was it.
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:01.400]  And they didn't really even use it.
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:10.400]  They could have subpoenaed Jack Ruby out of the Dallas area, brought him to Washington, where he could have told them the truth about what happened, as he pleaded with them to do.
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:12.400]  And they ignored him.
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:14.400]  They paid no attention to him.
[1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:16.400]  They told him they didn't have the power to get him out of here.
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:30.400]  And Jack Ruby, this petty crook, this mobster who had been involved with Al Capone from the time he was a child until he moved out of the Chicago area.
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:37.400]  He asked Earl Warren, he says, well, Mr. Chief Justice, you do have subpoena power, don't you?
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:47.400]  And the Chief Justice of the United States, one of the two or three highest ranking law enforcement officials in the world, had to admit that this petty crook had him on a point of law.
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:50.400]  So, you know, they refused to get him out of here.
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:54.400]  They said, Jack, if you feel you're in danger, we can terminate this interview anytime.
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:58.400]  That's not how you find the truth.
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:00.400]  What about Ruby's death?
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:04.400]  Ruby's death, of course, will always remain a mystery.
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:09.400]  Many people feel that he knew he had cancer, so it was easy to control him and get him to do this.
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:15.400]  Well, I know the doctor who had diagnosed Jack with Ruby two years later.
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:19.400]  Apparently, Jack had no idea that he had cancer, and he may not have originally.
[1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:23.400]  Ruby himself kept screaming that they were giving him cancer.
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:29.400]  They were forcing him to have injections, and he was convinced that they were injecting him with cancer cells.
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:35.400]  And it turned out later that the CIA in the 50s and 60s had developed fast-acting cancers for biowarfare.
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:38.400]  Absolutely so. No question about that.
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:45.400]  Interesting, as far as that goes, Jack eventually did die, apparently, of cancer.
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:55.400]  But when I was doing research on one of my earlier books, I called up the Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York,
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:50:06.400]  one of the most impressive and best cancer research units in the world, and asked them how easy it would be to give somebody cancer.
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:11.400]  And they told me that you cannot give a living organism cancer through injection like that.
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:17.400]  And I said, well, wait a minute, you do it with lab rats every day, and they hung up on me.
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:21.400]  Yeah, because you were calling the experts. I wonder who's involved in things.
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:29.400]  The experts, and of course they admit the polio oral and others had the live SV-40 that gave millions cancer.
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:34.400]  So, I mean, that's like denying the sun comes up in the morning. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:36.400]  Let me go ahead. You were making a point.
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:43.400]  No, I was going to say that Lee Oswald, when he was working in December of 1963 in New Orleans,
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:51.400]  was working with the Oschner Institute that was doing this kind of research on how to give cancers to people that were trying to develop the system.
[1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:59.400]  Stay there. Stay there. We're going to come back and talk about that, because there was also this obsession down in New Orleans with cancer and giving people cancer and treating cancer.
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:08.400]  We're right back.
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:36.400]  It's that simple, fresh, healthy, easy.

[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:09.400]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:16.400]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:52:16.400 --> 1:52:25.400]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:32.400]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:41.400]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:50.400]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:59.400]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:09.400]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:16.400]  The whole country's on a bus with a crazy driver. If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're all going to go over the cliff.
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:21.400]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:27.400]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines, domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping, and more.
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:30.400]  The government's going to know where everybody's ass is every minute of the day and night.
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:01.400]  UncivilLiberties.com
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:49.400]  We have a government run by a bunch of control freak, parasite, vampires. What's a mosquito?
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:59.400]  It's a parasite. Female, the species, to get protein to produce eggs sucks your blood.
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:05.400]  The news will take that out of context and have me on air. That's what they do, the news. People on the web saying vampires run things.
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:12.400]  I think that happened last week. I'm saying figurative vampires, sucking off the population.
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:21.400]  What was black slavery in this country? It was a parasitic activity.
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:25.400]  The media is so deceptive how they try to twist everything we do.
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:39.400]  Robert, I know you've run into a lot of that yourself. We were continuing with the cancer research and Oswald's girlfriend working for all this and what she said, continuing down that line.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:52.400]  You're referring there to Judy Baker, who was Oswald's girlfriend in New Orleans for some period of time, in the summer of 1963.
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:56:02.400]  She worked for Oschner as well, as Lee did too, more or less, as a lower-level person.
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:14.400]  She was a high-level researcher, but Lee and David Ferry were both involved in the same organization.
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:25.400]  They were doing cancer research. Ostensibly, what they were trying to do is develop a fast-acting cancer that could be given to all people for Del Castro.
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:32.400]  That's what they were investigating and dealing with.
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:39.400]  I feel that the fact that Lee knew so much about this, that he became dangerous.
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:43.400]  He knew far too much about this stuff and needed to be eliminated.
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.400]  When they needed a Patsy to blame the assassination on, that's where they chose him.
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:53.400]  He was expendable, and they wanted to get rid of him anyway.
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:57.400]  Of course, his background is well established that he was a CIA operative.
[1:56:57.400 --> 1:57:02.400]  Do you know specifically? I know he's been mentioned in some control letters and other things.
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:06.400]  He was at the YouTube base and then sent to Russia, allowed to defect back.
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:10.400]  That's a no-brainer right there. That was an inside job, and he was an operative.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:13.400]  Specifically, who Oswald was in the organization?
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:29.400]  Lee Oswald was apparently a highly trained CIA operative who was, according to these memos and the information that we have,
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:35.400]  he was actually sent to the Soviet Union on a mission he had no intention of ever defecting.
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:44.400]  By the way, the other side in some of the later books, actually all along they've been saying that Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union.
[1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:51.400]  Oswald never defected to the Soviet Union. He went there, he announced his intention to defect, but he never did.
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:57:57.400]  Never quite got around to it. When he wanted to come back to the United States, we brought him back.
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:01.400]  There's no formal record that he was ever debriefed.
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:07.400]  In fact, he was debriefed, certainly, but there's no formal record that he ever was.
[1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:13.400]  Instead of being arrested and tried as a traitor for giving them the information about the YouTube spy flights,
[1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:20.400]  we give him the money to come back. He comes back and nothing is ever done to him.
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:25.400]  This alone raises lots and lots and lots of questions as to who he was.
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:32.400]  And then he's buried into the white Russian community in Dallas. Our friends with the people in the white Russian community
[1:58:32.400 --> 1:58:36.400]  will be right back in one minute, and all you government operatives should listen.
[1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  Like McVeigh and Oswald and all of them, you get set up.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:51.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:58.400]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:02.400]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:04.400]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:07.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:14.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:21.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:25.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.400 --> 1:59:32.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:36.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:44.400]  Get the DVD at infowars.com. Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:44.400 --> 2:00:10.400]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:17.400]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:22.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.400 --> 2:00:29.400]  So many people that have woken up to the world government, the corruption, the tyranny, the propaganda, the military industrial complex
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:33.400]  woke up because of the JFK assassination.
[2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:41.400]  I'm going to be speaking with Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson at a Willie Nelson event. Coming up Sunday, it'll be streamed live and free over the web.
[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:48.400]  People are asking, where are the players for the show? They'll be up there by tomorrow, but it won't be live until about 9 o'clock at night.
[2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:53.400]  So just go there, click on it, it'll be there. The point is, that's a woke up Jesse Ventura. That's a woke up so many others.
[2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:57.400]  And we're talking to the man who got the subredor film out.
[2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:05.400]  Robert Groden, he did so much more, and he really is the permanent individual exposing all of this. We're going to go through what really happened that day from all the evidence he has.
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:10.400]  We've been going into different areas of it, different interesting areas of it.
[2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:15.400]  Robert Groden, I mean, do you want to just go ahead now and start, and then I want to take calls later in the hour?
[2:01:15.400 --> 2:01:24.400]  Walking through from your research, how this was really pulled off, and who was involved, and how this was done?
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:34.400]  Well, the most commonly asked question I get, I'm in Dealey Plaza every weekend, every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, unless it's raining or snowing, all year long.
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:43.400]  And the most common question I'm asked is, who killed President Kennedy, and why?
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:54.400]  Well, the government in 1979, through the House Assassinations Committee, released a report stating that it was organized crime.
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:59.400]  And I agree, it was organized crime, but not only organized crime.
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:06.400]  The Covert Actions Branch of the Central Intelligence Agency had been at war with President Kennedy since the time of the Bay of Pigs.
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:16.400]  When he announced that he was ending the Vietnam War one month and 11 days before he was killed, they must have panicked like crazy.
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:22.400]  It was big business, it was survival, it was massive amounts of money, billions of dollars.
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:28.400]  And I personally believe that that's the main reason why the President was killed.
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:35.400]  Yes, there was certainly the war against organized crime, that these people were not going to just roll over and play dead.
[2:02:35.400 --> 2:02:37.400]  They were going to fight back, and they did.
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:41.400]  But the Covert Actions Branch of the CIA was definitely involved in this.
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:43.400]  Their fingerprints are all over everything.
[2:02:43.400 --> 2:02:45.400]  So that's Harvey.
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:48.400]  Well, yeah, through Lee Harvey Oswald and William Harvey, sure.
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:52.400]  But also James Angleton and others as well.
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.400]  There were many people at the top that hated President Kennedy.
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:06.400]  Elfletcher Proudy, who was liaison officer between the CIA and the White House and the military at the time of the assassination,
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:15.400]  was a good friend of mine and told me many, many times through the years that the CIA was not going to just roll over and play dead
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:22.400]  and allow a single civilian in the White House to affect or control the CIA.
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:29.400]  And as a matter of fact, I was friends with Ruth Carter Stapleton, Jimmy Carter's sister.
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:34.400]  She told me that her brother was well aware of the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy,
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:38.400]  and that he was trying to find out what happened to get the information out,
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:42.400]  but that the CIA was laughing at him, that they paid no attention to him at all.
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:45.400]  You talk about a shadow government.
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:49.400]  The shadow is larger than the source of the shadow, unfortunately.
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:55.400]  And, you know, when we're talking about who's responsible for the death of President Kennedy,
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:58.400]  it's impossible to ignore Lyndon Johnson.
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:00.400]  It's absolutely impossible.
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:03.400]  You know, at what point was he involved?
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:04.400]  Was he a planner?
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:07.400]  Did he know about it and do nothing?
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:09.400]  We don't know that, for sure.
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:10.400]  We really don't.
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:14.400]  But we do know that he knew that it was going to happen,
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:18.400]  and he could have prevented it or at least attempted to, and he did not.
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:22.400]  Knowing, I think, himself that he would be a target if he did try.
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:29.400]  But when you look at the motive for killing the President, the greatest motive,
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:32.400]  and there's lots of other possibilities, certainly.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  I'm not denying that.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.400]  But the one that carries the greatest weight of evidence, and the one that makes the most sense,
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:42.400]  is to perpetuate and expand the Vietnam War.
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:44.400]  That, to me, is the ultimate answer.
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:47.400]  You're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:50.400]  Close to a trillion, and that was in those numbers.
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:54.400]  In the eight, nine years of the full-scale war.
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:59.400]  And then all his buddies dredging the ocean.
[2:04:59.400 --> 2:05:01.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:04.400]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:07.400]  has been walking in at night and checking on my children,
[2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:10.400]  checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs,
[2:05:10.400 --> 2:05:13.400]  but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they are secure,
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:16.400]  that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[2:05:16.400 --> 2:05:20.400]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:22.400]  I've always wanted to be a good provider.
[2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:26.400]  And I'm not going to change that now, just because the economy is in up-evil,
[2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:29.400]  and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty.
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:34.400]  And I hear about global famines, and I see the escalating prices in gas and food and oil.
[2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:36.400]  Electricity is going to go way up until this winter.
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:37.400]  Hey, I'm not going to sweat it.
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:38.400]  I've done the right thing.
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:40.400]  I got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage.
[2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:42.400]  I converted that money into food.
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:43.400]  That food's out there.
[2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:45.400]  I've got a two or three-year supply of food in the garage.
[2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:46.400]  My family's secure.
[2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:48.400]  I don't have to worry, okay?
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:50.400]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.

[2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:08.400]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:12.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:20.400]  We're going to open the phones up coming up at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:27.400]  Your chance to talk to one of the preeminent JFK researchers, certainly the most dedicated,
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:37.400]  and the person exposing it from day one as well, Robert Groden, down there many days a week
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:46.400]  in all sorts of weather at the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  We were getting into LBJ and obviously there were power elites that put him in control,
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:09:04.400]  but LBJ is the prime mover and having a serious motive wanting to be the king, wanting to be the president,
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:11.400]  and just the unbelievable amount of capital being transferred to the Southeast Asian War.
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:17.400]  We also have, of course, him wanting to get rid of the Federal Reserve's sole power to issue the currency
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:20.400]  or tell the Treasury what to print with Lincoln Greenbacks.
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:26.400]  He was a firing LL Limonser and others, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others,
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:29.400]  wanting to stage terror attacks in the U.S. to blame it on Cuba.
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:33.400]  I mean, Kennedy really was not going along with the game plan.
[2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:36.400]  And to understand where we are today, we have to understand who these individuals are.
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:39.400]  You were just talking about the arrogance of the CIA.
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:41.400]  I mean, it's sick.
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:43.400]  They ship the heroin, the cocaine in.
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:45.400]  They get caught all the time.
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:49.400]  Then they put our children in their private prisons owned by the big banks that launder the money.
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:51.400]  And that's not enough for them.
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  Now it's Homeland Security and the military industrial complex is literally eating, absorbing the real economy.
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:04.400]  And then the same crew in Wall Street that set up the CIA is just looting the currency.
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:08.400]  I mean, it's just, they're not going to go away by themselves.
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:11.400]  In fact, they're just going to keep expanding like a cancer.
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:16.400]  And so before we get more into the data of how they killed him, why they killed him, what really happened that day,
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:29.400]  the best evidence, your view on the statement I'm making about the same institutions, the same crew, their children, these institutions,
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:35.400]  they are basically running the same covert ops they run in third world countries just on a wider scale.
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:42.400]  Now here in the United States and your view on the military industrial complex, the national security state, Robert Groden.
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:46.400]  Well, I can't argue with a single thing that you said.
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:55.400]  I will add only that, you know, a lot of people feel that Johnson's involvement in the Kennedy assassination is too easy and patent answer.
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:11:08.400]  To that, I would add simply that it would do the powers that being no good to eliminate John Kennedy if his successor, Lyndon Johnson,
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:14.400]  wasn't willing to make the changes that they wanted, they would have to get an agreement from him in advance.
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:18.400]  Yeah, the two go together, so it fit like a horse and carriage.
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:20.400]  Well, absolutely, absolutely.
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:25.400]  But the point though is when you have this convergence of interests is when you get things like this, go ahead.
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:33.400]  The thing is they had to know that he would go along with their game plan, otherwise it would do them no good to eliminate President Kennedy.
[2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:38.400]  They had to have his agreement ahead of time that he would do what they wanted.
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:41.400]  And that makes him an accessory before the fact.
[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:48.400]  What about LBJ riding around on the radio, you know, talking on it, looking very wolf-like like he was on a rabbit hunt.
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:55.400]  You've got at the airport waving the secret service off, the secret service getting mad about the route.
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:12:02.400]  Well, yeah, the thing is that Johnson, through the years, had to make himself look innocent.
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:07.400]  He created the Warren Commission, which had absolutely no power whatsoever to do anything,
[2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:11.400]  and then ordered them to find that there was no conspiracy.
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:16.400]  Now, Johnson himself in later years admitted that the Warren Commission was wrong,
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:20.400]  that we would never know the whole truth about the assassination in our lifetime.
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:27.400]  And that basically was at a point where nothing could be done one way or the other to try to resolve it.
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:33.400]  So he's now creating a cover to make himself look like he's innocent, and then he disagreed with the Warren Commission.
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:36.400]  He ordered them to do what they did.
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:42.400]  That was the mandate, was to stop the rumors of conspiracy, not to find out who killed President Kennedy.
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:47.400]  And it was the same thing with the 9-11 Commission, and then they came out and said the President wouldn't let them do their job,
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:50.400]  and it's just pointing fingers at each other.
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:52.400]  Oh, man.
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:56.400]  Well, history does repeat itself.
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:58.400]  Where do you see it going?
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:04.400]  Just the corruption to where finally CIA commanders wear crowns, and we have to bow to them in the streets,
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:08.400]  and they just start, I mean, will it devolve?
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:13.400]  It makes sarcastic down to them just hunting our children in the streets and publicly barbecuing them.
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:18.400]  I mean, because that's the logical extension of empires and corrupt elites.
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  I mean, will this Wall Street banking CIA shadow government, I mean, they don't even care now.
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.400]  They're right out in the open.
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:31.400]  Well, again, these are the nightmares that we don't really like to think about.
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:35.400]  And certainly, those are the horror stories of our nightmares.
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:41.400]  The point of the matter is that if they can kill the President of the United States, they can kill anybody.
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:46.400]  And, you know, Big Brother is always watching. They're always listening.
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:57.400]  And, you know, I personally would like to think that the things that you're talking about could never happen, but we all know that it's entirely possible that they will.
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:06.400]  And, you know, I don't see an answer to being able to deal with that because they control the national news media.
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:10.400]  They control the broadcast licenses of television stations.
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:19.400]  They control access to the presidential news conferences that if a reporter disagrees with what Bush says, they can't show up at the conferences.
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:23.400]  They don't get the press handouts. That's how they survive.
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:33.400]  Well, of course, I was being sarcastic, but if you look at Rome or the Aztecs or any of it, the majority of the time when tyrannies are never checked, they just get crazier and crazier.
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:44.400]  I mean, it's wrong, guys, in the government. I know you're cold-blooded and don't care and think you're tough because you're cynical to ship heroin and cocaine in and then turn cops loose on us, swat teaming our houses.
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:50.400]  You know, for small amounts of it and put people in prison, it's wrong, all the predatory things they're doing.
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:55.400]  I mean, it's just, in reality, the bad guys never get punished.
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:15:04.400]  They just go on and on, and now they're fully debasing the currency and transferring trillions in the bailout directly to their own coffers.
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:09.400]  I mean, it's just everything's off the chart. I mean, I wonder what's coming next?
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:16.400]  Well, one thing that's definitely not coming next is our own personal bailouts. I want a bailout, too.
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:26.400]  You know, I'm being a little sarcastic there, but let's face it, you know, we're lied to on a daily basis. We've been lied to since the Kennedy assassination.
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:35.400]  And you made the point about half an hour, 40 minutes ago, that this all began with the Kennedy assassination, and you're right, it did.
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:41.400]  When they got away with that, it opened the door for Bobby and Martin and all the rest.
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:51.400]  And the fact that they were able to do it basically endorses their ability to pull it off any time that they want to, and 9-11 is just another incident of it.
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:57.400]  And that's what's happened with Bush, which will be passed on to Obama, McCain doesn't matter, they're just puppets.
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:16:04.400]  I mean, they put out Nemo saying they could torture children from their parents, and the military was given that. The cops have heard about that.
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:13.400]  Now they taser you if you don't give a blood sample or urine sample at the hospital. I mean, now all this evil isn't even kept in the dungeons anymore.
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  It's paraded as if it's good. Evil is now being advertised as good.
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:22.400]  Well, you're right.
[2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:35.400]  God help us. Where do you, in your 45 years of studying this, where do you see it going? Because, like I said, 5 minutes ago, it appears that they are in a nihilistic death orgy and are just going to go over the edge.
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:39.400]  It's just going to be right out in the open.
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:51.400]  Well, I don't see an end to it. When I began my work on the Kennedy case, I used to believe it was possible to find the answers, and that somebody somewhere really did want to know.
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:17:01.400]  When I was able to release the films of the assassination on national television for the first time on a TV show called Good Night America, it was a different world then.
[2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:07.400]  We had different problems. We had whatever. It can't even go into the differences between then and now.
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:18.400]  But we were able to find enough people in Congress that were honest enough to want to find the truth, and we got the House Assassinations Committee voted in.
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:29.400]  That couldn't happen today. That's what's so scary about it. It would take something like that in order to find the truth with what's left of the truth now.
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:51.400]  Robert, I had congressmen on two weeks ago, they were told, you passed the bailout, we're going to declare martial law, and then the Army Times reported they're going to deploy army brigades to the U.S. to, quote, deal with insurrection.
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:56.400]  I mean, they are cold-blooded, organized, and they know what they're going to do, and they're not going to stop.
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:05.400]  Well, if they can steal two elections in front of the watchful eye of the American public, they can do anything.
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:12.400]  Well, I hope all the government people watching your families go bankrupt and, you know, your neighbors go bankrupt. I just hope you're proud of yourselves.
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:26.400]  I really, you destroyed a really great country. Thanks a lot. So you can run off and have just unlimited amounts of money in your Swiss bank accounts and laugh at us and say, we're schmutz because we're not tough like you and don't have the will to do what you do.
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:34.400]  No, we're not cancer like you. We just want to live and be decent people. You know, I more and more just speak directly to those on the dark side.
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:42.400]  I just they are going to kill the host, Robert. They are going to kill the host.
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:54.400]  Well, being being part of the host, you and I have to have to be aware of it. But once again, it's outside of talking about it and trying to make other people aware of it.
[2:18:54.400 --> 2:19:04.400]  I'm not sure there's very much more that we can do. They've gone over a line a long time ago where they control literally all the power and they don't mind killing individuals.
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:05.400]  They like it.
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:21.400]  Ruby ridged the works. I mean, just it's all good. But we didn't even mention the David Koresh thing. You know, how many people were murdered there? Did anybody have to answer for that?
[2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:22.400]  No.
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:24.400]  That's the whole thing.
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:27.400]  And that was a precedent setting of him.
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:41.400]  The fact that they got away with it and were able through to whatever propaganda they were able to raise to make it look as if they did the right thing. No one's going to speak out that they really could.
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:47.400]  Well, the good news is people are waking up at mass and there's a lot at the end of the tunnel, but it's going to get a lot worse for gets better folks.
[2:19:47.400 --> 2:19:57.400]  I mean, the country has gangrene, basically. And the gangrene's rotten the flesh, running all over the body. And, you know, it thinks it's having a great time.
[2:19:57.400 --> 2:20:18.400]  It's gangrene. It's like the scorpion on the toad.
[2:20:27.400 --> 2:20:35.400]  I'm going to go with ozone before and after operations. And have you ever heard of ozone therapy? Ionic zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:42.400]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:21:01.400]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic zone ozone generators by going to ionicsone.com or calling 800-549-9535. That's IONIC zone.com or toll free 800-549-9535 Ionic zone.

[2:21:19.400 --> 2:21:32.400]  The percentage of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in Euro. Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen. Bad news for US currency.
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:37.400]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar. Trading equals permanent loss. Dollars fall into 65% of Euro. Erosion accelerates.
[2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:51.400]  Japanese despise imperialistic policy of US loss of confidence, causing more selling. GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control. Why attack Iran? Jerome O'Corsies. Iran leads attack against the US dollar document spells it out. Call 800-686-2237.

[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:12.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:14.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:17.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:22:17.400 --> 2:22:24.400]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:31.400]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:22:35.400 --> 2:22:45.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:53.400]  Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:57.400]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:00.400]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:09.400]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:24:09.400 --> 2:24:13.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:22.400]  Robber before time gets away from us, fire out some of the great films and books and materials you've put out and some of the websites so folks can get those.
[2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:32.400]  Well, the website, which is jfkmurder.com, right now there's nothing new available on it yet.
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:36.400]  My DVD is available on it. Actually, both DVDs are.
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:40.400]  By the way, these are incredibly well done and you say nothing new.
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  Most of what you know is new to the general public. They need to go there and get them.
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:47.400]  Well, I thank you for that. That's true.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:55.400]  But when the new book comes out, that'll be all brand new material and that's called JFK Absolute Proof.
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:25:00.400]  When it's available, it'll be announced on the website. It is not available yet.
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:06.400]  But it's a free website. Anyone can go there anytime they want to. There's no charge for it.
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:16.400]  It's jfkmurder.com and there's just a small handful of the older books available.
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:22.400]  High treason is still available. JFK, the case for conspiracy, is not.
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:25.400]  Let's see.
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  Well, if you go to the website, you'll see what is available now.
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:37.400]  Sure. Let me shift gears back into a wider view and then briefly go over what, as best you can tell, actually happened that day.
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:42.400]  What is the establishment going to do, though, when it comes out that the Gulf of Tonkin was staged in 1964?
[2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:48.400]  The USS Liberty was staged. That's now even in the Chicago Tribune. The intercepts have been declassified.
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:54.400]  What is the establishment going to do as it does come out? They planned Operation Northwoods, a 9-11-style attack.
[2:25:54.400 --> 2:25:59.400]  All these other terror attacks they staged. It comes out on Keith Oberman, the Dick Chaining.
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:04.400]  Wanted to have Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians and fake Iranian boats to attack our ships.
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:10.400]  I mean, all this is coming out and so there's this crisis. The public is finally waking up.
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:16.400]  But the system is bringing in the Homeland Security operation, which the smoke screen was, it was for terrorism.
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:21.400]  But really, the establishment, new folks were waking up. It was to suppress the population.
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:28.400]  Now the public gets it and we have this stalemate with thug enforcers who are on power trips
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:35.400]  and a freaked out public who now, I think, is realizing we have hardcore murdering terrorists running things.
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.400]  I don't know that there's anything that we really can do. I mean, you've got to ask yourself,
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:49.400]  what would happen if tomorrow morning somebody, some of government officials from whatever one of the Alphabet Supas of agencies
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:55.400]  got on Good Morning America or the Today Show and said, yeah, all right, you guys win.
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:27:02.400]  We killed the president. What's y'all going to do about it? What can we do? That's the problem.
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:07.400]  But when there's no rule of law, corruption just spreads until the society collapses
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:11.400]  and so the enemy will defeat themselves through their own corruption.
[2:27:11.400 --> 2:27:17.400]  Well, that's true. I mean, sooner or later, as you said, you know, the parasites will destroy the hosts
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:21.400]  and then there'll be nothing left. They'll have to live off of each other.
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  But by that time, we'll all be gone.
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:27.400]  Well, I'm glad you reminded me because I didn't have time to finish the analogy
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:32.400]  to the old story of the frog or the toad and the scorpion says, carry me across the river.
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:35.400]  And he says, but you're a scorpion. You'll sting me. And he goes, no, no, I promise.
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:40.400]  I won't just help me. And so being a nice frog and nice toad, it jumps in the water and swims across.
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:44.400]  And as they get to the other side, the scorpion stings him and he's there dying in the water.
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:48.400]  So how did you do that to me? I helped you. And he said, I'm a scorpion.
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:52.400]  And somehow they've trained the public just to love scorpions. Oh, I love.
[2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:58.400]  Oh, the citizen has a gun. I'm scared. But if a man in a black uniform and a black mask has it, I feel safe.
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:01.400]  I mean, it's just idiocy.
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:03.400]  Well, sad, sad, but true.
[2:28:03.400 --> 2:28:09.400]  Okay. Well, earlier, I was really letting you run. And now I'm jumping in because it's so thought-provoking.
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:13.400]  Continue with whatever you think's most important. It's such a wide range of knowledge.
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:22.400]  Again, one of the problems that we've got now is that it's a situation of the empire strikes back.
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:28.400]  When we had the mini-series, The Minute Who Killed Kennedy, we were getting a lot of good information out.
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:35.400]  But people were able to see it. But now some agencies have started to use programs called Unsolved History.
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:44.400]  They've produced a series of grossly dishonest programs to try to convince people that Oswald acted alone.
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:49.400]  And what's scary is the fact that the military seems to see through this.
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:29:00.400]  They showed documentaries with Oswald running down four flights of stairs to the second floor in what he said was 90 seconds.
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:06.400]  Well, Oswald didn't have 90 seconds. Had he been up there, he only had 72 seconds, number one.
[2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:13.400]  Plus the fact that there's a photograph taken of someone in the sixth floor window 30 seconds after the shooting,
[2:29:13.400 --> 2:29:17.400]  which reduces the time to get downstairs to 42 seconds.
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:21.400]  Well, they know that. But they still give him 90 seconds to get down.
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:25.400]  They have him running down and they close their way totally unobstructed.
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:31.400]  Well, let's talk about these hit pieces. It's like the 9-11 ones. BBC's turned up three of them.
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:34.400]  The U.S. has done it as well here in the U.S.
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  And they'll just say, hey, North Tower fell into building seven, knocked the third of it down.
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:45.400]  Then we have a present video that none of it was knocked in. They just say, we don't care, we say so, shut up.
[2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:51.400]  Well, they're right back with Robert Perot and stay with us.
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:55.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.400 --> 2:30:00.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.400 --> 2:30:04.400]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth,
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:10.400]  no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:30:10.400 --> 2:30:16.400]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and Canada.
[2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:23.400]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.

[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:08.400]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:31:08.400 --> 2:31:11.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:18.400]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the pro-lateral commission, the CAF.
[2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:27.400]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:31:27.400 --> 2:31:33.400]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:39.400]  Inside job? How dare you?
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:43.400]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:43.400 --> 2:31:46.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:51.400]  And if the government has not told the trust in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:57.400]  Please rise and download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.

[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:27.400]  Everybody knows the war is over. Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:30.400]  Everybody knows the fight is over.
[2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:36.400]  And the bad guys are into giving you cancer through injections.
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:41.400]  Bad guys are real into being bad.
[2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:43.400]  They like the dark side.
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:46.400]  They like death. They like power.
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:49.400]  They like fear.
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:52.400]  They like dropping napalm on little children running.
[2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:56.400]  They laugh while they burn.
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:34:02.400]  And you cynically, some of you that have sold out in the system, who are on the edges of it,
[2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:09.400]  you think we're safe as the American people and we allow those types of evils to be committed?
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:12.400]  You think when we send millions of men to these wars,
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:17.400]  but the establishment doesn't cherry pick the psychopaths, the opportunists,
[2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:20.400]  and doesn't put them into our society?
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:26.400]  You think you're immune from all that evil that you've supported?
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:30.400]  Yeah, so what, of three million Iraqis are dead in the last 18 years?
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:33.400]  A million and a half, the last five and a half?
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:35.400]  Yeah, there's a brown, let them die.
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:39.400]  But what you don't understand is that's coming home to roost on all of us.
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:42.400]  And God help us. I know who we're fighting. I know how evil they are.
[2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:44.400]  I know how real this is.
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:47.400]  And so does Robert Groden. Your calls are coming up.
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:53.400]  Robert, continue with these hit pieces, these incredibly dishonest TV pieces they put out,
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:56.400]  which always, right after they come out, are totally disproven,
[2:34:56.400 --> 2:35:00.400]  but it's designed for the massive people that they're into deceiving.
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:03.400]  And that hit piece is done on me and you meet these people and they'll lie and say,
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:05.400]  oh, it's not a hit piece.
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:07.400]  And several times after when they're done getting their car to leave, they go,
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:09.400]  you're a cook. We're going to expose you.
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:14.400]  Or they say, or one time they gave me a, they said, go out to eat with us.
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:16.400]  And at the end of it, they gave me a fortune cookie.
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:18.400]  They said, we brought you a special fortune cookie.
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:21.400]  And they said, break it open. We just brought it just for you.
[2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:23.400]  And it says, you're dead. We're going to kill you.
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:25.400]  And they all laughed at me and all just stared at me.
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:27.400]  And they said, you know, don't you?
[2:35:27.400 --> 2:35:29.400]  And I was just like, whatever.
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:33.400]  The point is, these are sick people, cowards, who decide to join the dark side.
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:35.400]  They love it that the dark side keeps winning.
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:38.400]  They love it that they can abuse innocence and twist and lie.
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:42.400]  They enjoy that the public's dumbed down that they can deceive them.
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  Robert Groden, speak to that.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:50.400]  Well, the point of the matter is that people tend to believe it if they see it on television.
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:55.400]  I had a relative who never believed what I said about the Kennedy assassination
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:58.400]  until he saw me say it on national television.
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:00.400]  Then he believed it.
[2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:06.400]  It's a sad thing where we're basically indoctrinated to believe what we see on the evening news.
[2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:09.400]  No matter what it is, no matter how unbelievable it is,
[2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:13.400]  we never question it because we have no other source of information.
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:15.400]  That's the problem.
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:17.400]  You are a source of alternative information.
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:20.400]  And you let people know that there is another side to this.
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:22.400]  And that's very, very important.
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:28.400]  But people, for the most part, when they see something on the Discovery Channel or the History Channel,
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:32.400]  they'll just arbitrarily believe it, no matter what.
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  And they don't have the information to question or challenge.
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:37.400]  That's what the problem has been.
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:42.400]  These shows that were produced, there have been, I think, three of them so far on Unsolved History,
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:48.400]  and they just finished a fourth in Dealey Plaza about a month and a half ago.
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:52.400]  They were doing something on the president's limousine.
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:54.400]  And every time they did it, they did it wrong.
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:37:00.400]  They had Mrs. Kennedy with her arms around the president, which never happened.
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:04.400]  And I went up to the director, the producers, everyone who was there,
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:07.400]  and I showed them the actual photographs, and they were doing it wrong.
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:09.400]  They said, oh, we don't care.
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:10.400]  And they didn't.
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:12.400]  That's the whole point.
[2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:14.400]  They had somebody there who knew the truth.
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  They didn't want to present the truth.
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:18.400]  And that'll be out on TV in a couple of days.
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  And everyone will say, oh, well, look at that.
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:29.400]  These are the same people who took a copy of the so-called Oswald rifle,
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:34.400]  tied it down with gaffer's tape after aligning the scope perfectly,
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:39.400]  having a professional trained shooter fire a gun at a stationary target,
[2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:42.400]  and even doing that, rigging everything,
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:45.400]  they still couldn't duplicate what Oswald is supposed to have done,
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:47.400]  yet they told us that they did.
[2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:50.400]  All these years dealing with these people,
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:52.400]  I mean, a lot of them are just sell-outs of the system.
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:53.400]  No doubt some are operatives.
[2:37:53.400 --> 2:37:55.400]  I mean, do you ever have some conversations with them
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:59.400]  where they just kind of just smile at you and say, you're going to lose?
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:04.400]  Where they just let you know, yeah, I'm with the bad guys, and I like it?
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:06.400]  Well, yeah, that kind of happens.
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  It happens sometimes.
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:09.400]  It's a bit more subtle than that.
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:14.400]  I was offered the job of director at the Sixth Floor Museum some years back,
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:17.400]  but they made it very clear to me that I would have to sell out
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:20.400]  and not be able to talk about the conspiracy.
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:22.400]  And I said, thanks, but no thanks.
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:27.400]  I turned the job down, paid $180,000 a year.
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:30.400]  Good money, but I wouldn't sell out.
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:34.400]  But they were just blatant enough to tell me that,
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:38.400]  that that's what it would take, and I refused to do it.
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.400]  You know, I have a friend who told me the analogy of,
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  well, somebody's talking about selling out, you say to them, well, what would you,
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  what would you take to give me your eyes?
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:52.400]  Well, we'll go to a clinic, sell me your eyes, they'll remove them.
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:54.400]  Well, you take $100,000.
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  No, you take a million dollars.
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:56.400]  No, you take $10 million.
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:57.400]  No, why?
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:38:59.400]  Because my eyes, I see it's my window of the world.
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  And you know, the eyes of the window of the soul.
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:03.400]  Well, then what would you give for your soul then?
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:06.400]  And people don't understand when you sell out for a uniform, for status,
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:09.400]  for $35 grand a year, for a million a year, whatever it is,
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:12.400]  you lose who you are as a human.
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:17.400]  And that's what's so sad about people that are purely materialistic.
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:18.400]  Of course, they're all so unhappy.
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:20.400]  They don't, I just can't believe it.
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:26.400]  I can't imagine selling out, Robert, because what I say and what I do is who I am.
[2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:29.400]  I can't cut my arms and legs off and sell them.
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:31.400]  I can't gouge my eyes out and sell them.
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:38.400]  I can't, you know, turn my, I mean, I don't understand how people are just so easy to be bought out.
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:45.400]  Well, they found somebody, they'll always find somebody, and that's the sad thing.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:49.400]  It's just that people just need to keep their eyes open.
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:56.400]  I think that you and I have a mutual friend who has said through the years,
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:40:01.400]  always question authority, is Jim Morris.
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:02.400]  Yeah.
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:04.400]  And it's true.
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:09.400]  If you question it, if you use your eyes, use your brain, think for yourself,
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  it's more difficult to confuse you.
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:15.400]  You know, look at the logic of things.
[2:40:15.400 --> 2:40:18.400]  Try to learn all the sides and use your own mind.
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:21.400]  If somebody out there wants to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:25.400]  in spite of all the evidence, you know, how are you going to convince them otherwise?
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  You know, it's just like religion to some degree.
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:30.400]  If you believe, you don't need proof.
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:33.400]  If you don't believe, no amount of proof is going to convince you.
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:35.400]  It's the same sort of thing here, too.
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:41.400]  The Kennedy assassination has become somewhat of a sporting event in the minds of a lot of people.
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:43.400]  People will come to Dealey Plaza.
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:47.400]  There'll be some many cases drunk or really snotty about things,
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:51.400]  and they'll try to impress their friends, and they'll be know-it-alls and say,
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:55.400]  well, this happened, and this happened, and this happened, and they'll be totally dead wrong.
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:59.400]  And you try to convince them, say, hey, look, you know, the doctor said that this wasn't true.
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:01.400]  The witnesses said this wasn't true.
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:05.400]  The acoustics have it and show this isn't true, and they just won't listen.
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:07.400]  They're just, you know, their minds made up.
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:09.400]  They don't want to be confused with facts.
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:12.400]  And those are the people that you have to feel so sorry for,
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:17.400]  because they're the ones who are going to lie to their selves, their children, their friends,
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.400]  and there's nothing you can really do about it.
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  They have bought into the lie. They've committed to it, and they can't admit they're wrong,
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:27.400]  but not just because they don't want to admit they're wrong.
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:30.400]  They're scared deep down, and they know that if it's true
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:33.400]  that the media lied and the government lied and the government killed Kennedy,
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:35.400]  they then know that a lot of other things are lies.
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:40.400]  And so they bought into so many other lies.
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:42.400]  Oh, true, true.
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:46.400]  All right, well, I want to take some calls, but just in a quick summation,
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:51.400]  as best you can tell, especially with all this new E. Howard Hunt information.
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:55.400]  I mean, hey, why do you think Hunt did that tape and now the videotape we just released last night,
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:42:00.400]  you know, basically admitting pretty accurate stuff according to you and the other experts
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:07.400]  that sure enough he was involved in setting it up to kill him in Chicago and Miami,
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:12.400]  but they decided on Dallas and that it was LBJ, at least as his chain of command went up to.
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:14.400]  Why do you think Hunt did that?
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  Well, you know, there is something in this history that's pretty much forgotten,
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.400]  and I'll bring it up because it does relate extremely closely to your question.
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  Well, when they blew his wife up.
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:29.400]  Well, yeah, when Dorothy Hunt was killed and along with all the other people on the airplane.
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:34.400]  Yeah, that was another unforgivable thing, but where do you stop? It goes on forever.
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:40.400]  Now, the thing that I'm thinking about is the fact that Hunt years ago filed the lawsuit
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:47.400]  for pain and suffering because the issue was stated that he was part of the conspiracy
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:57.400]  and he thought that his kids might believe it and therefore, you know, it was hurtful to him and to them.
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:42:59.400]  So he used that as the excuse to file a lawsuit.
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:00.400]  And then he lost it.
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:07.400]  Well, he lost the suit, but the issue that everybody seemed to forget and didn't pay attention to at the time
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:13.400]  is that he had testified before the Rockefeller Commission that he was not in Dallas
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:20.400]  and he used his own kids as testimony that he was elsewhere at the time.
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  So if they were testifying that he was somewhere else, then he knew they knew he wasn't there.
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:30.400]  He said he made Chinese food for him and of course the kids said he never made him dinner or something.
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:36.400]  Right, but at the time, if in fact his excuse before the Rockefeller Commission was truthful,
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:39.400]  then they would know he wasn't there. How could that be painful to them?
[2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:42.400]  How could they possibly believe it if they knew otherwise?
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:44.400]  And that's what I think he was trying to straight now.
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:51.400]  I think he was trying to basically make restitution for using them.
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:57.400]  Yeah, well, St. John says he's proud of it too.
[2:43:57.400 --> 2:44:00.400]  That the son is proud of the father?
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:06.400]  No, no, St. John was saying his father was proud of being involved in that.
[2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:11.400]  Well, you know, how do you deal with it? How do you deal with somebody like that?
[2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:16.400]  You know, the whole Hunter, just the whole bunch of them, the whole Watergate crew.
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:24.400]  The same people were used by Nixon and Watergate is used by Johnson and the...
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:29.400]  And his wife was going around with a bag full of the checks from Nixon and a bunch of cash.
[2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:33.400]  You can go around as the bag lady just trying to get money for the guys.
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:37.400]  You know, so they could defend themselves. They were all taking the rap going to prison.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:40.400]  And Nixon and them didn't even want to give them the money.
[2:44:40.400 --> 2:44:42.400]  You know what? We'll just blow your wife up.
[2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:45.400]  They even directed the plane into another airport so they could cover it up.
[2:44:45.400 --> 2:44:49.400]  Roger, Niner, Niner, come on over here to this landing field.
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:51.400]  They blow it up as it's coming in.
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:55.400]  And then the FBI swoops in on the scene, covers it all up instantly.
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:58.400]  And, you know, that's a message. We'll kill your whole family.
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:01.400]  That's what the evil people who work for the government need to understand.
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:03.400]  You are totally expendable. That's what I don't even get.
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  I study these people. They don't even tend to take care of their killers.
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:09.400]  They tend to kill them.
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:14.400]  There's got to be a lesson there somewhere.
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:19.400]  I guess the lesson is don't kill for the government.
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:24.400]  I mean, you know, there's Dorothy Hunt flying around getting the money for the plumbers.
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:29.400]  I guess Nixon and them said just, and reportedly, according to St. John's sheet,
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:32.400]  they had just threatened them again with the checks.
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  And, you know, give us more money.
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:36.400]  You know, there was a movie that was released last year.
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:40.400]  Fabulous, fabulous movie. It's called Shooter with Mark Wahlberg.
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:41.400]  Excellent.
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:42.400]  Kate Mara.
[2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:49.400]  There's a line in it read by Levon Helm, who was from the drummer from the band.
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:51.400]  But he's an actor in it.
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:57.400]  And he says, those boys in the book depository, they were all dead before sundown.
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  They're buried out in the desert.
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:02.400]  And somebody asked him, he says, well, how do you know that's true?
[2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  He says, I still got the shuffle.
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:09.400]  They were buried out in El Pango by sunset.
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:11.400]  Well, how do you know? Still got the shovel.
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:13.400]  That's it.
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:17.400]  Just when you think you got it figured, Gunny, look again.
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:21.400]  You know that movie very well, don't you?
[2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:23.400]  I saw it in the theater and then I saw it on the treadmill.
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:24.400]  That's great.
[2:46:24.400 --> 2:46:28.400]  Oh, God, in fact, I'm into play clips on the show. I never got around to it.
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:30.400]  That's the thing people don't understand.
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:33.400]  I think evil's cool and sexy and neat and fun.
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:35.400]  It stinks to high heaven.
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:42.400]  And as soon as you get into it, folks, it just implodes on you and there's no end to it.
[2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:44.400]  Well, evil is simply evil.
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:46.400]  Give out your website one more time.
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  The website is JFKmurder.com.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:51.400]  JFKmurder.com.
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:53.400]  The free website is no charge to go there.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:56.400]  But the DVDs, folks, you want the straight skinny, get them there.
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:46:57.400]  Let's take a few calls.
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:00.400]  Lindsay in Idaho, you're on the air with Robert Gruden.
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:01.400]  Hello?
[2:47:01.400 --> 2:47:02.400]  Hello, Alex.
[2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:03.400]  How are you today?
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:04.400]  Good.
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:07.400]  I have one specific question for Mr. Gruden.
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:12.400]  I watched and read a lot about the Kennedy assassination.
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:15.400]  Not much is ever mentioned about the three tramps.
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:18.400]  Mr. Gruden, what can you tell me that you know about them?
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:31.400]  Well, there were three tramps that were on a freight train that was parked at the western end of the parking lot on top of the grass, you know.
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:36.400]  And right after the assassination that train started to take off,
[2:47:36.400 --> 2:47:41.400]  Lee Bowers, a fellow working in the railroad tower, a dispatcher in the railroad tower,
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:45.400]  saw it pulling out, realized he had not given permission for it to leave.
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:48.400]  He stopped the train, called the police, had it searched,
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:54.400]  and a quarter mile south of Deli Plaza where it was stopped, these three guys were arrested.
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:59.400]  They were taken off and marched over the triple overpass.
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:03.400]  Then, through the parking lot, back in front of the Texas School Book Depository,
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:06.400]  and diagonally across into the police station.
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:15.400]  Now, these three guys remained a mystery until the Shaw Trial, and in 1967, I think it was 1967,
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:21.400]  Jim Garrison appeared on The Tonight Show and showed them publicly for the first time.
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:26.400]  And of course, Johnny Carson didn't want them shown and kept dragging them out of his hands and what have you.
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:29.400]  But that was the first time the public became aware of the traps.
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:33.400]  And of course, it just so happened they were spitting images for Frank Sturges and E. Howard Hunt.
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:34.400]  Yeah.
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:40.400]  Now, those three guys have been positively identified four separate times.
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:42.400]  There's four different sets of people.
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:46.400]  Once again, just confusing the heck out of the public.
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:55.400]  And the problem is that, oh, I guess about 10, 12, 13 years ago, the arrest records finally appeared.
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:48:58.400]  Up until that point, there were no records of the arrest at all.
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:00.400]  That's my question. Who are they?
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:08.400]  Well, we have the paperwork for the rest of three guys, a guy named Gedney and two others, who were apparently legitimate traps.
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:10.400]  But this is where it's interesting.
[2:49:10.400 --> 2:49:16.400]  The actual arrest photographs, the mug shots, the fingerprints, all of those are gone.
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:18.400]  They've all disappeared.
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:19.400]  My, what a surprise.
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:20.400]  Yeah.
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:24.400]  Well, the thing is, we don't really know who these people are.
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:33.400]  Some of them appears to be Frank Sturges, but he also appears to be Charles Harrelson, a man who had formally admitted to shooting President Kennedy.
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:35.400]  He just died in prison, Woody Harrelson's dad.
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:41.400]  And he was in prison for shooting a federal judge in Texas at 400 yards in the neck with a 243.
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:43.400]  So he was an old hand assassin.
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:49.400]  But I mean, I've looked at those photos and I've got a really good eye and I've blown them up on a computer.
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:55.400]  And it, and of course, St. John says it's his father and he would know him.
[2:49:55.400 --> 2:49:56.400]  You can also see him trying to pump the states.
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:49:57.400]  He is an uncanny resembler.
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:02.400]  Well, I mean, look, it looks like Frank Sturges to me and it looks like he Howard Hunt.
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:03.400]  Yes.
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:05.400]  Well, I agree.
[2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:06.400]  It does look like him.
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:08.400]  We don't know for sure.
[2:50:08.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  Did you know St. John said his dad did go in and came back a few weeks later with his ears smaller?
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:17.400]  He had parts of his ears cut off according to him?
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:18.400]  That's very interesting.
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:24.400]  So then in other words, nobody still really knows much about these three tramps?
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:26.400]  Well, we know they were arrested.
[2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:30.400]  We know they were held until just after Leos was murdered and then they were released.
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:32.400]  Were they fingerprinted?
[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:33.400]  I'm sorry?
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:35.400]  Were they fingerprinted?
[2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:36.400]  They must have been.
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:38.400]  If they were arrested, they were fingerprinted.
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:40.400]  Those fingerprints have never surfaced.
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:42.400]  That's why I questioned the official version.
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:44.400]  Yeah, they got to dummy those up before they do that.
[2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:45.400]  Yeah.
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.400]  Anything else, caller?
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:47.400]  No, that'll do it.
[2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:48.400]  Thank you.
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:49.400]  You bet.
[2:50:49.400 --> 2:50:50.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:51:02.400]  We'll be right back for this quick break with our amazing guest, Robert Groves.
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:06.400]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:07.400]  Of course not.
[2:51:07.400 --> 2:51:11.400]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards and circulation in
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:13.400]  your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:17.400]  I'm Wal Augustino, it's founder of Identity Stronghold and we think this is information
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:19.400]  you need to know.
[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:22.400]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards because they look physically
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:24.400]  just like the old card.
[2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:28.400]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:33.400]  the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing
[2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:34.400]  the card.
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:37.400]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:42.400]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents and that's why we manufacture the
[2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:43.400]  SecureSleeve.
[2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:48.400]  The SecureSleeve is a patent pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier preventing
[2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:50.400]  radio signals from reaching your card.

[2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:07.400]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:08.400]  against this country.
[2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:11.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:12.400]  This is the enemy.
[2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:13.400]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:13.400 --> 2:52:14.400]  This is his MO.
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:15.400]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:17.400]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:22.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:24.400]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:29.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:31.400]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.400 --> 2:52:40.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:44.400]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:45.400]  much more.
[2:52:45.400 --> 2:52:51.400]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with
[2:52:51.400 --> 2:52:54.400]  hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:53:01.400]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:03.400]  Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:08.400]  80 percent of all Americans and 85 percent of people around the world suffer from internal
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:10.400]  parasites and parasitic infection.
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:18.400]  diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:23.400]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1 percent of all cases.
[2:53:23.400 --> 2:53:25.400]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:53:25.400 --> 2:53:30.400]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:36.400]  and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:37.400]  beverage once a day.

[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:11.400]  Raging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:56.000]  Oh, there's the theme music, but they had a mission impossible with Ethan Hunt named
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:01.840]  after E. Howard Hunt, unsubmitted with the creators of the show, all about throwing it
[2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:02.840]  in our face.
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:05.640]  And a caller earlier mentioned that back during the X-Files, you know, they have an episode
[2:55:05.640 --> 2:55:08.040]  about who killed Kennedy, and they go, okay, Mr. Hunt, you can go ahead and go into the
[2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:09.760]  Smoking Man's office.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:11.960]  They love flaunting it in our face.
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:16.160]  Let's continue with the phone calls.
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:18.280]  Let's talk to Mark in Georgia.
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:20.640]  Go ahead, Mark, you're on the air with Robert Groton.
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:21.640]  God bless you.
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:23.800]  As you know, you're ever in our prayers.
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:26.400]  I want to say one thing very briefly.
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:31.600]  You remember in the movie, the outlaw, Josie Wales, where after the gunfight, they discussed
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:36.400]  why did you pick this target first, that target, and then the Indian companion to Josie asked,
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:37.880]  oh, what about this other guy over here?
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:39.760]  And so I wasn't even worried about him.
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:41.240]  And I went, why not?
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:42.920]  Because I knew you were with me.
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:44.680]  I know that you're too busy.
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:48.600]  Deal with these guys who Nenny and Nit pick you on Myspace.
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:53.280]  I want you to know that when he says, I was there with you, and I wasn't worried about
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:54.280]  him.
[2:55:54.280 --> 2:55:58.480]  When somebody attacks you about some ridiculous nuance, I'm there to cover your six.
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:55:59.480]  Okay?
[2:55:59.480 --> 2:56:00.480]  Well, I appreciate that.
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:06.200]  And I wanted to mention a while back, and I want to be specific this time.
[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:12.240]  It was Dr. Paul Martin, who gave a presentation about the manipulation tactics that cults
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:18.320]  use to, basically, cults, generally speaking, have to have the witting compliance of their
[2:56:18.320 --> 2:56:20.600]  adherence.
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:25.520]  People are led to believe that the group knows what's best for you, and although we're doing
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:28.440]  things that are painful to you, we're doing it for your own good.
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:32.360]  And one of those things that they do is called a manipulation, the manipulation tactic is
[2:56:32.360 --> 2:56:33.360]  called a loaded term.
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:37.560]  It's a term with a strong emotional charge, like with the former international church
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:41.520]  of Christ, which, thank God, came to its senses, if you told one of their adherents,
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:45.720]  your divisive, it would lead them to believe that there was something wrong with them
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:50.280]  or questioning the practices and the beliefs of the system, rather than that there's something
[2:56:50.280 --> 2:56:52.160]  wrong with the system.
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:56.240]  And in the same way, the wake-work-term conspiracy theorist, I think we're on the same page.
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:59.720]  Yeah, no, no, I mean, it's a huge loaded term, it means automatically this person's
[2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:03.760]  a kook, they're insane, which, you know, it's saying these are nuts.
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:06.240]  You want to comment on that to Robert Rowden?
[2:57:06.240 --> 2:57:17.000]  Well, you know, there's, the power of the word is extremely strong, and different ways
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:18.560]  of words can be used.
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:24.120]  For instance, in Dealey Plaza, people say, well, was the president shot in the front?
[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:28.480]  Well, he wasn't shot in the front, he was shot from the front.
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:32.120]  It hit him in the right side of his head, but it was from the front.
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:39.400]  The way words are used are not always just lack-tasical, there's a reason for it.
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:44.280]  And that's just 101 for anybody, and people get horrified by hunting, but you still eat
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:45.280]  meat at the store.
[2:57:45.280 --> 2:57:50.640]  I mean, I shot deer and wild hogs in the head, and you shoot them with a.308, and it goes
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:54.680]  in small, sometimes you can't even find the hole, and it blows the whole other side of
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:55.680]  the head off.
[2:57:55.680 --> 2:57:58.760]  You shoot them in one side of the head, from the side, the other side of the head blows
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:02.120]  off, you shoot them in the front of the head, the whole back of the head blows off.
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:03.120]  It's the same thing with humans.
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:08.040]  I mean, for anybody that's ever shot something in a mammal in the head, I mean, you know what
[2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:10.640]  ballistics do, it's such an insult to people.
[2:58:10.640 --> 2:58:13.880]  Well, you know, that's the way they get away with it, though.
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:23.920]  You know, you had Dan rather get on CBS TV Sunday, two days after the assassination, and
[2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:27.040]  tell us that when the president was struck in the head after seeing there's a brooder
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:29.360]  film, he was thrown violently forward.
[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:34.160]  Well, that's certainly not true, no matter where the shot came from, he was shot and
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:35.160]  thrown to the rear.
[2:58:35.160 --> 2:58:38.160]  All right, stay there, stay there, we're going to come right back in one minute.
[2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:51.680]  And our guest is staying in there 20 minutes with us.
[2:58:51.680 --> 2:58:53.600]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[2:58:53.600 --> 2:58:58.120]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[2:58:58.120 --> 2:58:59.640]  hour there is hope.
[2:58:59.640 --> 2:59:02.480]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:06.920]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new
[2:59:06.920 --> 2:59:08.440]  world order master plan.
[2:59:08.440 --> 2:59:12.680]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:59:12.680 --> 2:59:18.080]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:59:18.080 --> 2:59:20.920]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:59:54.480 --> 3:00:12.520]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:20.840]  Well we've got the longest, continual, most dogged researcher to JFK, the main consultant
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:28.600]  on the film JFK, worked with Jim Mars on that and Oliver Stone with us for another 20 minutes
[3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:34.000]  and I want to get to Greg and Ray and Nelson and others that are patiently holding.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:37.440]  But I want to get a few questions out of the way that I haven't got to yet.
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:40.800]  First off, you got caught off by the break, sorry, with satellites and syndication.
[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:43.200]  We can't push breaks back so I apologize, Mr. Groden.
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:46.600]  Robert Groden, you were trying to make a point, we're talking about Dan Rather, Shane Kennedy
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:51.120]  was thrown forward from being shot in the back of the head, just chuddle-bowled in the
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:57.840]  subredor film when it finally came out, he's lunging backwards, he's being smacked and
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:01:02.080]  then being pushed back and the whole back of his head blowing out, so go ahead.
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:06.320]  Well, that's the whole point.
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:10.320]  Back in those days we believed everything they told us.
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:16.480]  Nobody would dare ever question Dan Rather or Walter Cronkite or anybody like that.
[3:01:16.480 --> 3:01:18.680]  And that's the problem.
[3:01:18.680 --> 3:01:22.080]  It wasn't true, but they knew we'd never get to see the subredor film.
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:24.840]  They knew in their heart of hearts that they wouldn't get caught.
[3:01:24.840 --> 3:01:29.800]  And that's why somebody like a Cronkite or a Rather are put in those positions because
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:33.160]  they've already lied over and over again, they've already shown that they'll do whatever
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:34.160]  they're told.
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:37.000]  But I mean, I wonder what Rather was thinking going out there and lying and knowing they'd
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  killed Kennedy.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:45.760]  Well, you know, he built his career on that, he became a national figure because of that.
[3:01:45.760 --> 3:01:51.240]  Before that he was just local here in Dallas, it was nothing, but he became their trusted
[3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:52.240]  guy.
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:55.720]  And the establishment said, oh, he'll play ball, play ball.
[3:01:55.720 --> 3:01:57.040]  And he did.
[3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:06.760]  And when I released his uprooter film back in 1975, he very soon thereafter made the
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:12.360]  statement in his book, The Cameron Never Blinks, that he had simply made an honest mistake.
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:15.880]  Well, he made a mistake, but there was nothing honest about it.
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:25.960]  Now, in answer to your last caller's question, you know, semantics is extremely important.
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:31.600]  And if you can't say he was thrown to the left or to the right or the front or the
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:34.200]  rear, is that kind of a mistake?
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:37.640]  He was thrown to the rear, period, there's no question about that.
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:41.400]  Well, it's explosive, it just slams him back.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  Exactly.
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:49.760]  But by that time, I'm sure that rather was told that the public would never have a chance
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:50.760]  to see this uprooter film.
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:54.080]  Well, what about all the witnesses, exactly, he knew they'd never see it, so he went ahead
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:55.080]  and said it.
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:56.080]  They didn't know that you had secured it out.
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:02:57.960]  How did you sneak that out?
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:03:02.960]  Well, it wasn't so much a matter of being able to sneak it out per se, although I guess
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:03.960]  it kind of was.
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:06.280]  Here, here's the situation.
[3:03:06.280 --> 3:03:16.520]  I had gotten my hands on the film in 1969, and I only told specific researchers in the
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:20.520]  Kennedy case, a small number of researchers about what I had, showed them what I had.
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:24.080]  It was just a small group of people.
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:25.080]  In 1970...
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:30.000]  You don't want to talk about how you got your hands on it?
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:32.280]  Well, I worked for a company in New York.
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:33.840]  We did work for Life Magazine.
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:39.760]  We blew it up from 8mm to 35mm for Life Magazine.
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:43.000]  They wanted to see what kind of resolution they could get out of it.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:46.640]  This is something that had never, ever been done before.
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:52.080]  No one had ever blown up 8mm to 35mm like this.
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:04:02.240]  So I made an extra copy, and I say that, too, because I thought that sooner or later, they
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:03.960]  would release it, but they never did.
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:05.680]  But it probably would have been doctored, though.
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:09.520]  Well, the thing is that to this very day, I'm convinced that the film never would have
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:14.760]  been released if I hadn't been the one to release it.
[3:04:14.760 --> 3:04:15.760]  It was a gamble.
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:18.040]  How'd you get the photos with his head blown off?
[3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:25.600]  Well, I worked for the government for three years, and I worked as a photo analyst, and
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:29.640]  part of the things I worked on were those photographs, and that's about as much as I'm
[3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:32.640]  kind of willing to say.
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:36.600]  Man, just amazing that you've been able to ferret all this out.
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:43.800]  I mean, folks, the whole back of his head blows off, and I'll assure you, go out to
[3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:51.480]  East Texas, go shoot a wild hog in whatever side you shoot, a tiny hole, and the other
[3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:54.760]  side of its high-powered rifle looks just like Kennedy's head.
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:04:55.760]  Okay?
[3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:56.760]  It's real simple.
[3:04:56.760 --> 3:05:01.760]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:04.000]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.

[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:10.240]  or contact a poison control center immediately.
[3:05:10.240 --> 3:05:12.760]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[3:05:12.760 --> 3:05:17.840]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling,

[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:28.720]  Solacemyl contains 84 mineral-rich Himalayan sea salt, baking soda, and xylitol, a sugar
[3:05:28.720 --> 3:05:31.360]  substitute with long-lasting dental benefits.
[3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:36.040]  Solacemyl comes in five flavors made from grade A essential oils, so I know it'll please
[3:05:36.040 --> 3:05:37.040]  even your kids.

[3:06:01.080 --> 3:06:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:08.520]  against this country.
[3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:10.680]  The enemies start America on September 11th.
[3:06:10.680 --> 3:06:12.680]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.680 --> 3:06:13.680]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:14.680]  This is his MO.
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:15.680]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:06:15.680 --> 3:06:17.680]  We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[3:06:17.680 --> 3:06:22.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:06:22.480 --> 3:06:25.040]  networks inside the United States.
[3:06:25.040 --> 3:06:29.520]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:06:29.520 --> 3:06:31.680]  in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.680 --> 3:06:35.360]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:40.840]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:40.840 --> 3:06:45.000]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  much more.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:08.080]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime
[3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:09.080]  in the future?
[3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:11.720]  At Lays Med Inc., the future is here.

[3:08:00.360 --> 3:08:04.840]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:08:04.840 --> 3:08:09.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:09.320 --> 3:08:14.800]  I want to go to Greg Rae, Nelson, Ronnie, and others for Robert Broden.
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:20.480]  But I wanted to bring Aaron Dykes, and he's been working with me for now two years off
[3:08:20.480 --> 3:08:21.480]  and on.
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:26.080]  Two years since we've been working on a JFK film quietly in the background while we're
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:27.680]  making other films.
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:33.680]  And he had a few quick questions for you here on AIR.
[3:08:33.680 --> 3:08:36.360]  Mr. Broden, should we go ahead and ask your questions, Aaron Dykes?
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:43.520]  Yeah, my question was basically in terms of the top suspects that Howard Hunt names William
[3:08:43.520 --> 3:08:45.760]  Harvey and other CIA figures.
[3:08:45.760 --> 3:08:49.920]  How well does that fit in with the fact that they were doing coups in all these third-world
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:52.600]  countries that their jobs were to overthrow leaders?
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:08:53.600]  Yeah, that's true.
[3:08:53.600 --> 3:08:54.600]  The government will go to it.
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:56.920]  The program was even called Executive Action, I believe.
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:09:01.720]  Or at least that was one of the programs, the ZR Rifle program.
[3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:04.920]  What can you say about that in terms of how it fits into the assassination?
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:09.880]  Oh, absolutely, these were the people with the mode of opportunity and means to do it.
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:10.880]  They had the practice.
[3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:11.880]  They had the experience.
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:13.880]  They had the money.
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:19.280]  There's no question in my mind that these were among the guilty parties.
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:20.680]  They may not have been alone.
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:28.040]  They may have had support in other areas from perhaps specific politicians or mobsters or
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:29.040]  what have you.
[3:09:29.040 --> 3:09:31.480]  But yeah, it would have been impossible.
[3:09:31.480 --> 3:09:39.760]  For instance, let me say, the government stated in 1979 that it was the mob that was responsible
[3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:40.760]  for the assassination.
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:47.360]  Well, they might very well have been to some degree, but can you imagine some mobsters
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:53.360]  in Chicago or Miami or New Orleans having the power to control the investigations through
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:57.840]  the years to get Oswald killed?
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:03.040]  In the media and the FBI, look, and the public has been ignorant on this.
[3:10:03.040 --> 3:10:04.520]  Now they kind of understand it.
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:09.040]  The CIA, when it was OSS and every other intelligence agency, British intelligence going back 300
[3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:13.280]  years, they always use local crime rings in any area.
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:16.600]  They're smuggling or getting out data or information.
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:20.920]  They always use the local criminal networks because they know the way of the land.
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:22.280]  And it gives plausible deniability.
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:26.520]  Well, with all of that, and everything that you just said is absolutely true, the other
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:32.800]  thing though is by bringing them in, they prevent themselves from being victims of blackmail
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:41.800]  later on because by being able to link the mob organizations with them, then they would
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:44.360]  be basically it's an insurance policy.
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:45.360]  It's a corruption.
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:47.240]  I mean, that's what corruption is all about.
[3:10:47.240 --> 3:10:49.720]  It's not just getting money and stealing.
[3:10:49.720 --> 3:10:51.080]  It's about corrupting.
[3:10:51.080 --> 3:10:54.600]  It's about getting others in on the corruption.
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:55.600]  Yeah.
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:10:56.600]  So I agree.
[3:10:56.600 --> 3:10:57.600]  Yes, absolutely.
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:00.840]  I have absolutely no problem believing that the people that you mentioned were involved
[3:11:00.840 --> 3:11:01.840]  in this.
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:04.120]  Well, it's just amazing.
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:07.360]  Aaron, you had some other questions?
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:08.360]  No.
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:12.480]  Just on the general idea, it's just they were even in their specific roles.
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:17.200]  Hunt says William Harvey was overseeing it as kind of the supervisor.
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:22.440]  He was the supervisor of the executive action program, and Hunt was kind of the sub manager
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:25.160]  of that more on the ground.
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:29.360]  It's just the players, he says, were involved were specifically in their same roles they
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:30.360]  did in other countries.
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:33.440]  I'm going to play that world exclusive video coming up at the bottom of the hour right
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:35.040]  when our guest leaves us.
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:36.040]  He's pretty amenable.
[3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:39.720]  I'll probably twist his arm to the bottom of the hour, another 18 minutes or so.
[3:11:39.720 --> 3:11:41.560]  Stay here, Aaron, because I know you may have more questions.
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:46.200]  I've got a few questions here before we take these final calls for Robert Rudd and probably
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:50.280]  the premier incredible researcher on JFK.
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:54.480]  Robert, George H.W. Bush, we know he'd been involved in CIA.
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:11:59.320]  We know he was involved with some Bay of Pigs operations and using some oil platforms as
[3:11:59.320 --> 3:12:00.320]  fronts.
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:05.080]  Scullin' Bones was what CIA was founded out of, and he just wasn't made director in
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:11.040]  the 70s out of falling off a turnip truck, and then there's that famous photo, which
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:15.840]  is a spitting image of him, even the same mannerisms, but do you think there's any credibility
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:16.840]  to that?
[3:12:16.840 --> 3:12:18.760]  You mean that he was actually in D.L.E.
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:19.760]  Pryza?
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:21.520]  Yes, or involved in any way.
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:29.320]  Well, we know that he was in Texas that day, most probably, almost to a certainty in Dallas,
[3:12:29.320 --> 3:12:37.840]  but we also know that he was flown to Washington, D.C. the next day, which got him out of here.
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:47.680]  I am not in any way, shape, manner, or form a fan of either one of the Bushes.
[3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:55.680]  We know that Bush, when he was being picked as the director of the CIA, he lied to Congress
[3:12:55.680 --> 3:13:01.920]  and said he had never worked for the CIA, when in fact we know he had prior to his being
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:02.920]  named director.
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:06.480]  Now, we have FBI files and letters, and list that evidence.
[3:13:06.480 --> 3:13:12.320]  Well, again, we have documents relating to the Kennedy assassination, which mention George
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:13.320]  H.W.
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:14.320]  Bush of the CIA.
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:20.440]  Okay, that's another George H.W. Bush in Texas, which is absurd.
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:26.440]  Oh, my God, there's no end to it.
[3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:29.280]  There's no end to these people.
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:36.680]  I mean, one question that's always crossed my mind in relation to what you just mentioned
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:45.920]  is, if Bush was willing to lie to Congress to commit perjury over working for the CIA,
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:48.480]  you have to ask yourself, why?
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:50.760]  What was so important that he keeps secret about?
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:54.640]  Yeah, why not say, hey, because that was the criticism, is that he never had the intelligence
[3:13:54.640 --> 3:13:55.640]  background.
[3:13:55.640 --> 3:13:59.400]  Now, we're suddenly just going to be the director out of nowhere, and they were saying,
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:03.680]  wow, and exactly, why wouldn't he say, oh, yeah, I work for the agency?
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:07.640]  Well, that's the whole point, you have to ask yourself, why would he take the risk of
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:09.480]  lying about it?
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:12.240]  And that's a question that still to this day hasn't been answered.
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:14.760]  He still hasn't messed up.
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:19.000]  Well, that gives him a lot of cachet, I think, clearly involved.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:22.680]  I think that photo, and there's no doubt in my mind, it's him.
[3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:23.680]  But could well be.
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:29.000]  That certainly gave him a lot of, you know, cred with the boys, making his bones just being
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  involved.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.960]  Oh, boy, they're at the school bus depository building.
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:37.360]  Okay, let's take some calls here.
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:40.800]  Greg in New York, you're on the air with Robert Groden.
[3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:43.280]  Hey, Al, hey, Robert, how are you?
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:44.880]  I'm fine, how about yourself?
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:45.880]  Great, thank you.
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:51.040]  It's an honor and a privilege to call myself an American, to know people like yourself.
[3:14:51.040 --> 3:14:55.360]  I'm a first time caller, and I'm also an expert, and I've been a stockbroker in New York for
[3:14:55.360 --> 3:14:57.440]  over 14 years.
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:15:02.760]  And I've studied the Federal Reserve for a very long time, and I've heard some things
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:08.920]  about why Jeff Gate got shot because he was going to basically sign Form 1110, which was
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:09.920]  to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:13.600]  Well, he had a lot of people, man, that's why they whacked him.
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:20.120]  Well, my biggest thing, and I've been warning people for many years not to let them force
[3:15:20.120 --> 3:15:25.720]  a global economy, because basically what they're looking to do is basically put everybody
[3:15:25.720 --> 3:15:27.560]  on the bread line.
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:28.560]  No, that's it.
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:31.760]  They can have worldwide inflation and control things and consolidate.
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:32.760]  We have their own documents.
[3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:38.200]  Not only that, but what people don't understand and people are afraid, they're all sheep.
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:42.000]  I mean, they call it sheep, and the reason they call it sheep is because most people
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:43.600]  don't think like you and Robert.
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:46.360]  Most people don't think as individuals, they think in groups.
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:52.280]  Well, they think that what they think is reality, and so they decide to say everything's fine
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:54.000]  and rationalize it.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:55.440]  They're actually pretty smart.
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:15:59.160]  It's just they're cowards, and a coward doesn't just coward and hide.
[3:15:59.160 --> 3:16:00.160]  They lie to themselves.
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:07.480]  Well, it's the great William Cooper who said, God rest his soul, listen to everyone, read
[3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:13.200]  everything, believe no one, and do your own research, and that's exactly what you guys
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:14.680]  are doing.
[3:16:14.680 --> 3:16:21.080]  The point of the matter is, these people control, the Federal Reserve controls the food prices,
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:24.520]  they control what you pay at the pump, the gas, they control your mortgage, they control
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:26.240]  the tax on your property.
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:32.400]  These people control every aspect of the dollar, and when people start to realize that and
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:37.120]  research that for themselves, everything else that you talk about on your show is so easy
[3:16:37.120 --> 3:16:38.120]  to see.
[3:16:38.120 --> 3:16:40.440]  Now, here, do you have a question for Robert Grudn?
[3:16:40.440 --> 3:16:41.440]  Yes.
[3:16:41.440 --> 3:16:48.560]  Basically, my question is, do you feel that because JFK tried to abolish the Federal Reserve,
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:51.840]  that is one of the biggest reasons that he was murdered?
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:55.800]  I think that that's one of the reasons why he may have been yes.
[3:16:55.800 --> 3:17:01.240]  I think that what I've done through the years is I've had to weigh the different potential
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:02.240]  motives.
[3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:08.080]  To me, the Vietnam War seems to be the greatest motive, but it doesn't eliminate that as being
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:09.080]  a very strong...
[3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:11.880]  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of troughs they wanted to suck out of, and a bunch of other
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:14.200]  things they wanted to shut down the county was doing.
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:17.840]  My feeling is, yes, it may very well have had a lot to do with it.
[3:17:17.840 --> 3:17:25.120]  But I would never eliminate that as a potential, but when people asked me why was the president
[3:17:25.120 --> 3:17:31.680]  killed, I said that there's a lot of reasons why, but as far as I can see, and from all
[3:17:31.680 --> 3:17:37.960]  my years of doing this, the greatest motivation with the most logic behind it is the Vietnam
[3:17:37.960 --> 3:17:39.640]  War, but it's not the only reason.
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:41.040]  All right, Greg, thanks for the call.
[3:17:41.040 --> 3:17:43.680]  Ray, Nelson, and Ronnie, we're going to get to you when we come back, but in the last
[3:17:43.680 --> 3:17:48.880]  segment with our guests, but Robert Groden, I don't want to spend too long on this.
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:51.080]  I mean, I am just a huge fan of JFK.
[3:17:51.080 --> 3:17:52.280]  I think it's a great film.
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:53.280]  You consulted on it.
[3:17:53.280 --> 3:17:56.480]  I know you know Oliver Stonewell.
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:18:02.440]  He puts out the Towers movie, which reinforces the official story.
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:07.280]  Now he puts out W that makes W like an idiot savant that people were mean to, and he really
[3:18:07.280 --> 3:18:12.120]  thought there were WMDs, and the CIA made a mistake, and it's all a huge whitewash from
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:17.320]  what we know, and very slick propaganda because it's done in a way to make fun of Bush, but
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:19.560]  it really rehabilitates him.
[3:18:19.560 --> 3:18:20.560]  What has happened to Oliver Stonewell?
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:24.880]  I've been told by Hollywood insiders that it's all the drug convictions that they're
[3:18:24.880 --> 3:18:25.880]  basically threatening him.
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:27.920]  I mean, do you have any comment on that?
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:31.600]  Honestly, I really kind of don't.
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:34.400]  Ollie did a great job with JFK.
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:36.640]  I was very, very proud to be a part of it.
[3:18:36.640 --> 3:18:40.000]  I would not have traded the opportunity.
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:45.600]  I wish like heck that he would do JFK2 and tell the rest of the story because the first
[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:49.040]  movie is only not even the first half.
[3:18:49.040 --> 3:18:54.280]  We've learned so much more since the time period covered by that first movie.
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:55.280]  I love the first movie.
[3:18:55.280 --> 3:19:01.360]  I think it's one of the best things ever done, and was so proud to be part of it, but without
[3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:06.600]  JFK2 to tell the rest of the story, the public will never know what the rest of the story
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:07.600]  truly is.
[3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:13.320]  They know how the case got to where it is now, how the actual evidence had been released.
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:16.280]  When you look at the overall picture, Jim Garrison was a hero.
[3:19:16.280 --> 3:19:17.440]  He did an awful lot.
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:22.600]  He put his whole life on the line to do this, but they controlled him.
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:25.520]  They controlled the investigation, and he lost.
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:33.120]  The second one, which led to the House of Fascination Committee, which admitted the conspiracy,
[3:19:33.120 --> 3:19:36.720]  that was much more of a success overall.
[3:19:36.720 --> 3:19:38.640]  That part of the story has not been told.
[3:19:38.640 --> 3:19:43.000]  I want to talk about briefly Jim Garrison, the man, when we get back with our guest,
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:46.680]  just an incredible interview that we're having with Robert Grudman.
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:51.280]  We'll also tell you about some of his films and books and materials that are all must-haves.
[3:19:51.280 --> 3:19:52.280]  Aaron Dyches is also with us.
[3:19:52.280 --> 3:19:53.760]  Man, I don't want to let him go.
[3:19:53.760 --> 3:19:57.480]  I'm going to twist some arms nicely here and see if we can keep him in longer.
[3:19:57.480 --> 3:19:58.800]  We'll be right back.
[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:02.200]  Stay with us.
[3:20:02.200 --> 3:20:07.560]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds here
[3:20:07.560 --> 3:20:11.360]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:16.640]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:20:16.640 --> 3:20:18.200]  to tell their story.
[3:20:18.200 --> 3:20:27.240]  Whitman, EVA director on the AG, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:20:27.240 --> 3:20:32.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:34.280]  take action against their global masters.
[3:20:34.280 --> 3:20:37.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:43.240]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:46.760]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:52.600]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:55.240]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:20:58.920]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:20:58.920 --> 3:21:01.600]  and bring in martial law.
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:02.880]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:05.920]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the
[3:21:05.920 --> 3:21:07.560]  risks of deficit spending.
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:11.840]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[3:21:11.840 --> 3:21:15.480]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[3:21:15.480 --> 3:21:19.840]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:21.520]  for immediate withdrawal.
[3:21:21.520 --> 3:21:25.560]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[3:21:25.560 --> 3:21:28.360]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:32.880]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:33.880]  for depositors.
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:38.200]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:39.200]  inflation.
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:43.400]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[3:21:43.400 --> 3:21:47.160]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[3:21:47.160 --> 3:21:51.840]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:53.640]  for over 6,000 years.
[3:21:53.640 --> 3:22:01.480]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:01.480 --> 3:22:06.080]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights on toll booths and scanning the freeways just
[3:22:06.080 --> 3:22:10.840]  waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:14.840]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:19.440]  Spray your plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:24.200]  Spray your plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images making
[3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:25.880]  your plate unreadable.
[3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:31.000]  One can of photo blocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever and is completely
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  undetectable.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:36.320]  You cannot afford to not be protected with spray your plate photo blocker.
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:43.280]  Call 1-800-276-9601 or go to sprayyourplate.com, that's sprayyourplate.com.

[3:22:45.360 --> 3:22:48.960]  You are no longer defenseless against big brother who is watching us all.
[3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:57.960]  Go to sprayyourplate.com or call 800-276-9601, that's 800-276-9601 today.
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:23:01.160]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate.
[3:23:01.160 --> 3:23:05.440]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[3:23:05.440 --> 3:23:09.520]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper than dirt survival food, this is going
[3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:12.560]  to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:14.060]  Here is why.
[3:23:14.060 --> 3:23:18.000]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:22.520]  safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food
[3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:24.600]  shortages here in the US.
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:27.240]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[3:23:27.240 --> 3:23:30.400]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the US this fall?
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:34.160]  Don't wait, learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in
[3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:35.160]  a crisis.

[3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:11.840]  Ray Nelson, Ronnie, we're going to get to you because our guest is going to stay until
[3:24:11.840 --> 3:24:17.000]  about 40 afterwears, it's just too important that I'm going to play that audio from the
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:21.560]  exclusive video that was just released last night of E. Howard Hunt, not just the audio,
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:26.080]  you'll hear the audio of the new video, that's up on infowars.com right now.
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:30.840]  There's also a press release out, Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura to host anti-war pro peace
[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:31.840]  event.
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:34.640]  I need to call Paul and have him add that we'll also be giving speeches, not just a question
[3:24:34.640 --> 3:24:35.640]  and answer.
[3:24:35.640 --> 3:24:39.560]  I forgot to tell him that in the press release this morning as I gave it to him over the
[3:24:39.560 --> 3:24:42.080]  phone as he transcribed it.
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:45.400]  But to help us get that press release out to everybody, and if you're media interested
[3:24:45.400 --> 3:24:50.440]  in talking to one of these guys, you know, in the evening before the event, you can email
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:51.440]  Aaron at infowars.com.
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:55.080]  I forgot to give you that duty, you're in the press release, need you to watch that
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:56.080]  this weekend.
[3:24:56.080 --> 3:24:58.600]  I know you're also going out to Willie's place with me, Ventura, Sunday morning, you
[3:24:58.600 --> 3:24:59.600]  and Rob.
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:02.880]  But I also need you to watch that for media because I don't want to just have a press
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:06.480]  conference and have some Nerdy Wells show up.
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:11.160]  And yes, Nerdy Wells, we're aware of you, whoever the Nerdy Wells are, and so we can
[3:25:11.160 --> 3:25:12.160]  do that.
[3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:17.120]  That's one of the 9-11 truths of the war, all of it also far made.
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:20.760]  Robert Groden, I'm going to come back to the next segment and jam in three or four calls
[3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:24.560]  for you, but right now in the short one, where our breaks worked most of them are in the
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:27.160]  first half hour.
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:31.520]  More about the interesting, you know, perspective of being one of the chief advisors and people
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:37.040]  on the film JFK in Dallas, filming part of it in Dallas, shooting it there at Daily Plaza.
[3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:40.680]  You talk about all this harassment you go through now and over the years, you know,
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:44.480]  80-something tickets, hundreds, 400-something harassments.
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:49.360]  Were you guys harassed there, were there any dirty tricks there, was Stone ever threatened?
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:56.280]  No, he wasn't, but the thing is he has a much higher public profile than I do.
[3:25:56.280 --> 3:26:01.680]  The thing is that he wasn't really on his own.
[3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:06.680]  He had a whole backing, you know, all of it, of the film production company and everything.
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:07.680]  Yeah, Entourage.
[3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:12.800]  Well, the thing is that, you know, they were basically buying, you know, Warner Brothers
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:16.960]  was buying the time there.
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:23.040]  We had private security, we had public security.
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:30.120]  We had paid an incredible amount of money to be able to film in Daily Plaza.
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:37.600]  And there was actually a formal boat taken within the city council, whether to allow
[3:26:37.600 --> 3:26:40.680]  or not allow Olly to shoot there.
[3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:47.120]  And it cost a lot of money, I guess, to grease the city's coffers, as it were, to get permission
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:48.520]  to do it.
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:54.440]  But Warner Brothers, Hollywood's pretty establishment, I mean, the backstory, the inside baseball
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:26:55.440]  scoop on that.
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:58.720]  I mean, how did Stone get that film made?
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:26:59.720]  I mean, it's powerful.
[3:26:59.720 --> 3:27:03.640]  Well, the thing is, no one had done anything on it, ever.
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:06.800]  And he had the power to do it, and he had massive names, stars.
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:11.760]  If you look at the cast of that movie, it's astonishing.
[3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:20.680]  Kevin Costner, Sissy Spasic, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Lemon, Walter Matthow, and on and on
[3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:21.680]  and on.
[3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:25.080]  Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, as I said.
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:28.960]  Well, the more I studied the JFK, I mean, I've always known a lot about it, but nothing
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:29.960]  like you.
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:33.000]  The more I realized, you know, the big who, who, how, how, or whatever, I mean, it's
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:34.800]  all really from reality.
[3:27:34.800 --> 3:27:38.040]  I mean, it's all from things that were seen or videotaped or filmed.
[3:27:38.040 --> 3:27:39.640]  I mean, that thing is super accurate.
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:41.720]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:43.680]  People just don't tend to understand that.
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:49.280]  I hear a lot of complaints saying that, that it was all Hollywood and Oliver made up a
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:50.280]  lot of stuff.
[3:27:50.280 --> 3:27:51.280]  That's not true at all.
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:56.840]  There's a book out there called JFK, The Book of the Movie, and it's the entire script,
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:27:59.280]  and it's completely annotated.
[3:27:59.280 --> 3:28:04.120]  Everything that, everything that is mentioned in the movie is shown in the book, you know,
[3:28:04.120 --> 3:28:07.720]  where it came from, who said what, what the actual testimony was.
[3:28:07.720 --> 3:28:13.800]  Yeah, there was a little bit of, of, of fudging the facts a little bit where it came to witnesses
[3:28:13.800 --> 3:28:18.960]  for instance, if there were six or seven witnesses that all said one or two things.
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:20.720]  You would condense it down into one person.
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:21.720]  There you go.
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:22.720]  I mean, that's what Hollywood has.
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:27.160]  It, it, it's like the Patriot, isn't just the swamp fox, he's two other people from
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:32.600]  South Carolina with the swamp fox, so it's basically all true or 98% of it.
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:38.840]  It's just condensed into one character for, you know, for the cinematic and literary reasons.
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:43.720]  Yeah, just amazing, just amazing that he was able to make that film.
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:46.800]  You know, knowing about being an expert on George Bush, and I, you know, I am, I've really
[3:28:46.800 --> 3:28:52.480]  studied it a lot, seeing W, it's all completely accurate, stunningly accurate the way they
[3:28:52.480 --> 3:28:57.640]  talk, the mannerisms, what they say, but it's lying by omission, different from JFK.
[3:28:57.640 --> 3:29:01.480]  Because, because, because it's what they leave out in W.
[3:29:01.480 --> 3:29:03.200]  It's, it's, it's, it's a travesty.
[3:29:03.200 --> 3:29:04.200]  Have you seen W?
[3:29:04.200 --> 3:29:06.200]  No, I haven't seen it yet.
[3:29:06.200 --> 3:29:07.700]  Oh, it's a travesty.
[3:29:07.700 --> 3:29:10.520]  Well, I'm, I'm looking forward to seeing it.
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:19.440]  I know it couldn't possibly ever be as good as JFK was, but you know, as I said, I admired
[3:29:19.440 --> 3:29:20.440]  President Kennedy.
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:27.200]  I was, I was a big fan, who's the first politician in my life who I ever admired, and I can't
[3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:28.440]  stand George Bush.
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:31.680]  I truly cannot stand him.
[3:29:31.680 --> 3:29:36.840]  I think he's destroyed this country, and, you know, and what can you say?
[3:29:36.840 --> 3:29:40.440]  I mean, the record speaks for itself.
[3:29:40.440 --> 3:29:41.440]  It does.
[3:29:41.440 --> 3:29:47.800]  Final segment, your phone calls, straight ahead with Robert Grote and the premier JFK
[3:29:47.800 --> 3:29:52.240]  on the ground research, the man that brought you the Zabruder film.
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:55.960]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[3:29:55.960 --> 3:30:02.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:02.400 --> 3:30:05.880]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:09.760]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:30:09.760 --> 3:30:11.360]  than when drinking the water?
[3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:15.200]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:16.400]  into the skin.
[3:30:16.400 --> 3:30:21.040]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[3:30:21.040 --> 3:30:26.560]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:30:26.560 --> 3:30:27.900]  algae, and fungus.
[3:30:27.900 --> 3:30:32.760]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:30:32.760 --> 3:30:33.760]  comes first.
[3:30:33.760 --> 3:30:37.960]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:40.000]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:30:40.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  What about you?

[3:31:01.680 --> 3:31:07.360]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[3:31:07.360 --> 3:31:08.360]  this country.
[3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:10.680]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:31:10.680 --> 3:31:12.680]  But who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.680 --> 3:31:13.680]  Bin Laden.
[3:31:13.680 --> 3:31:14.680]  This is his MO.
[3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:15.680]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:31:15.680 --> 3:31:17.800]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:31:17.800 --> 3:31:22.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:31:22.480 --> 3:31:25.060]  networks inside the United States.
[3:31:25.060 --> 3:31:29.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:31.720]  in and on the U.S.
[3:31:31.720 --> 3:31:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.400 --> 3:31:40.840]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:31:40.840 --> 3:31:45.000]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:46.000]  much more.
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:47.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:33:19.800 --> 3:33:25.560]  Well, I was just mentioning behind the scenes, didn't the JFK film itself have a role in
[3:33:25.560 --> 3:33:30.040]  was it the assassinations review board or had to do with declassifying a lot of relevant
[3:33:30.040 --> 3:33:35.520]  documents just as a lot of researchers, especially you've led to a lot of stuff getting into
[3:33:35.520 --> 3:33:39.280]  the public that would have never been seen if it, you know.
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:42.480]  Yes, you're absolutely correct.
[3:33:42.480 --> 3:33:48.920]  At the end of the movie JFK, it is mentioned that the records that were being held private
[3:33:48.920 --> 3:33:58.200]  until the year 2039 and as a result of that, there was a lot of requests of Congress to
[3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:06.080]  do something about it and the assassination records review board was named to review and
[3:34:06.080 --> 3:34:09.200]  release what could be released.
[3:34:09.200 --> 3:34:17.280]  All documents relating to the JFK assassination is called the JFK Records Act and they actually
[3:34:17.280 --> 3:34:20.400]  existed for, I think, three years.
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:22.480]  They interviewed me on five separate days.
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:31.680]  I was actually spent, I guess, gosh, 70-some-odd hours being questioned about the autopsy photographs
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:38.960]  and the photographic evidence of the Kennedy case, the films and what have you because
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:44.960]  outside of the Zapruder film was I who released all of the other films as well, 122 different
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:47.200]  films of the assassination.
[3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:55.400]  And the autopsy pictures and within my last two books, which was the killing of a president
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:35:01.120]  in the search for Lee Harvey Oswald, I released 1,200 photographs and the new book will have
[3:35:01.120 --> 3:35:04.400]  800, which will bring the total up to about 2,000.
[3:35:04.400 --> 3:35:12.080]  No, it's, there's no doubt that we can say that you are the grandpoobah, the Mac Daddy,
[3:35:12.080 --> 3:35:16.480]  the big kahuna when it comes to getting the info out.
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:19.800]  Let's jam in some quick phone calls.
[3:35:19.800 --> 3:35:21.640]  Ray, in Texas, go ahead.
[3:35:21.640 --> 3:35:22.640]  Mr. Groden.
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:23.640]  Yeah.
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:24.640]  How are you doing?
[3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:25.640]  I'm fine.
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:26.640]  You yourself?
[3:35:26.640 --> 3:35:27.640]  Oh, pretty good.
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:35.760]  Mr. Groden, back when you said George Bush, senior, was director of the CIA, the CIA needed
[3:35:35.760 --> 3:35:41.240]  money to build, they're called dumb, deep underground military bases.
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:45.080]  And what they did is they couldn't funnel the money, they couldn't funnel money through
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:48.520]  Congress because that would be like going through the people.
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:53.120]  So what they did is they approached George Bush, senior, because he had the first offshore
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:54.120]  drilling rigs.
[3:35:54.120 --> 3:35:57.040]  He owned the pot, the oil here in Texas.
[3:35:57.040 --> 3:36:00.360]  And they started the whole cocaine running.
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:04.120]  They would bring the drugs onto the oil rigs and then into America and didn't have to
[3:36:04.120 --> 3:36:05.120]  go through customs.
[3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:07.800]  Well, sir, let me just stop you.
[3:36:07.800 --> 3:36:12.680]  The Russell Trust set up Skilling Bones as an opium monopoly and the British East Indian
[3:36:12.680 --> 3:36:17.680]  Company and these same families have been bringing the drugs in here forever.
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:20.880]  And they were bringing, they were engaged in narcotics traffic in World War II.
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:24.680]  So to say that George, but just go ahead and make a point.
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:25.680]  Yeah.
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:29.280]  My point is the connection with JFK.
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:39.200]  Now when they did this, hold on a second, what it comes down to is, okay, they built
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:43.920]  the deep underground military bases and they funneled money through Congress, Kennedy found
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:44.920]  out about this.
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:49.720]  He found out about the drug situation and he found out about this alien situation.
[3:36:49.720 --> 3:36:55.400]  He gave them two weeks to tell the American people about the alien situation and to get
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:36:57.160]  rid of the drugs.
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:58.160]  Three days later, he was dead.
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:36:59.160]  All right.
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:01.120]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Ray.
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:04.760]  I'm just not going to go there, but thank you.
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:09.600]  Let's talk to Nelson and L.A. you're on the air with our guest, Robert.
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:10.600]  How are you doing?
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:11.600]  Hi.
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:12.600]  Hi.
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:17.400]  My question was, I've got the documentary of the James Files confession.
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:21.720]  I wanted to know if that was any, was there any validation with that?
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:25.760]  The James Files situation is an open question.
[3:37:25.760 --> 3:37:33.720]  I tend to believe at least the majority of it simply because here's a guy who's telling
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:38.680]  a story that can be checked out or a great deal that can be checked out and the government
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:41.040]  refuses to find out if it's true or not.
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:44.520]  They won't investigate it and I think the reason why they're not is because they're
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:47.480]  afraid that they'd find out that it is true.
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:54.280]  I tend not to immediately dismiss anything along that line and here's a guy who's telling
[3:37:54.280 --> 3:37:57.280]  a story that most of it can be proven.
[3:37:57.280 --> 3:38:03.680]  The only part that can't be proven is his personal stuff and maybe it is true.
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:06.480]  Give him a couple of lie detector tests and he's telling the truth.
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:07.480]  Thank you, Nelson.
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:09.000]  We've got to move faster to get to everybody.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:11.560]  What about Madeline Duncan Brown?
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:13.960]  I knew Madeline for years.
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:21.000]  She and I had known each other, not the same way that Lyndon knew her, but I tended to
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  believe her story.
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:25.720]  Do you think they killed their son with that fast acting cancer?
[3:38:25.720 --> 3:38:27.200]  Well, it's possible.
[3:38:27.200 --> 3:38:31.600]  I only spoke to Stephen once, Lyndon's son.
[3:38:31.600 --> 3:38:35.160]  Well, he was admittedly his mistress.
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:36.160]  That's on record.
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:37.160]  Oh, yeah.
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:42.080]  But the thing is that we ever know all of that story, I don't know, but you know, Madeline
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:47.520]  swore under oath before Congress that Lyndon told her about the assassination before it
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:51.160]  happened and I tend to believe it.
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:52.160]  Okay.
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:54.600]  Ronny in LA.
[3:38:54.600 --> 3:38:55.600]  Go ahead, Ronny.
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:38:56.600]  Yeah.
[3:38:56.600 --> 3:38:57.600]  What's up, Alex?
[3:38:57.600 --> 3:39:00.480]  First off, I want to thank you guys for your work.
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:06.440]  I just had a quick comment on how controlled the media is and how all this ties in together
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:09.000]  and how scripted everything is.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:15.120]  Because there's no question JFK was a potential inside job and I was inside job, no doubt
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:17.320]  all evidence points that way.
[3:39:17.320 --> 3:39:24.200]  But it's funny how, speaking of the W movie, you said on your quick review on Monday or
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:30.120]  Sunday, you said that how they built up Colin Powell as if he was a genius or hero and then
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:39.120]  on Monday, you turn on the TV and all the media outlets, they have them with this well-prepared
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:41.960]  speech on how he endorses Obama.
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:45.120]  Yeah, you got Schwarzenegger endorsing Obama.
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:46.360]  You've got Powell doing it.
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:49.040]  I mean, all the front men, it tells you who they want.
[3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:50.880]  I'm not saying go for McCain either.
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:53.760]  The point is, is they're going to sucker everybody big time.
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:55.400]  Thanks for the call here.
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:39:57.360]  Let's take one last call.
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:39:59.360]  Rick in Texas, go ahead.
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:03.600]  Yeah, Rick, you want to go on there?
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:04.600]  Yeah, thanks.
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:05.600]  I didn't know you.
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:10.760]  Hey, in your book, there's a picture of the limousine speeding away from the schoolbook
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:11.760]  depository.
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:16.880]  Then you blow it up and look at the people on the street and there's Oswald on the street
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:19.200]  dressed in his clothes he was arrested in.
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:20.800]  Can you speak to that?
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:24.600]  Can you talk about maybe if there's enough time for him to get off the street into that
[3:40:24.600 --> 3:40:25.600]  lunch room?
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:32.280]  If you're talking about the man in the doorway of the depository, it's not Lee Oswald.
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:34.000]  It's Billy Love Lady.
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:38.920]  Billy Love Lady looked very much like Lee Oswald from the front, from the side.
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:40.520]  He looked nothing like him.
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:45.400]  I presented pictures from both the front and the side.
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:50.040]  At the time that picture was taken, the actual moment that was taken, Lee was on the second
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:53.120]  floor talking to a woman named Geraldine Reed.
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:57.240]  Mrs. Reed testified to the Warren Commission about this and they told her to keep her mouth
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:40:58.240]  shut.
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:02.120]  She has just recently passed away and there's a whole chapter in my new book relating to
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:03.120]  what she said.
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:04.120]  All right.
[3:41:04.120 --> 3:41:05.760]  I have a question.
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:08.920]  Why did they kill the Dallas cop that looked just like Oswald?
[3:41:08.920 --> 3:41:11.640]  Do you think he was some cop of double or involved?
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:16.680]  Well, J.D. Tippet, the cop you're talking about, didn't look all that much like President
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:17.840]  Kennedy really.
[3:41:17.840 --> 3:41:22.920]  They were both slim build and like that, but I think the reason why they killed Officer
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:28.920]  Tippet was in order to link Oswald to something that the Dallas police would care about.
[3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:32.200]  They wouldn't care about the assassination of President Kennedy for that.
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:35.320]  That was meant to get them hyped up to go along with later killing him.
[3:41:35.320 --> 3:41:36.320]  There he goes.
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:40.960]  So that the warning shot when Oswald was finally found would find its mark.
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:41.960]  So that's a false flag.
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:45.160]  Again, to get the cop stirred up, manipulate him.
[3:41:45.160 --> 3:41:46.160]  That's what I think.
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:50.920]  I mean, don't forget Officer Tippet was killed with an automatic and Oswald had a revolver.
[3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:53.160]  It was not the same type of weapon.
[3:41:53.160 --> 3:41:54.160]  Rick, I got to let you go.
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:41:55.160]  I'm sorry we heard to those calls.
[3:41:55.160 --> 3:41:56.160]  We have to let our guests go.
[3:41:56.160 --> 3:41:59.920]  I don't want to abuse this time and I've got some news I want to cover.
[3:41:59.920 --> 3:42:04.720]  Robert Groden, I really appreciate you spending all this time with us and I can't wait to
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:10.440]  see you again when we tape with you for a couple of days up in Dallas after this year's
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:11.440]  anniversary.
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:15.720]  So I will see you soon, my friend, and thank you for all your tireless work, your real
[3:42:15.720 --> 3:42:17.760]  champion of liberty and truth.
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:18.760]  Thank you, Ox.
[3:42:18.760 --> 3:42:19.760]  It's very kind of you.
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:20.760]  So are you, certainly.
[3:42:20.760 --> 3:42:21.760]  All right.
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:22.760]  God bless you and take care of my...
[3:42:22.760 --> 3:42:25.440]  Oh, is there any numbers you want to give out to get your books and videos or is it just
[3:42:25.440 --> 3:42:26.440]  the website?
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:29.840]  No, just the website, JFKmurder.com is the easiest way.
[3:42:29.840 --> 3:42:31.360]  There's an address there.
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:37.320]  There's an order form and as soon as the new book is available, it'll be announced on the
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:38.320]  website.
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:39.320]  Okay.
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:40.320]  Thank you so much, sir.
[3:42:40.320 --> 3:42:41.320]  Thank you.
[3:42:41.320 --> 3:42:42.320]  Take care.
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:43.320]  There he goes.
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:44.320]  All right.
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:45.320]  This is a 14-minute video.
[3:42:45.320 --> 3:42:46.320]  I barely have time because of the break to play it.
[3:42:46.320 --> 3:42:48.920]  Again, this is a world exclusive here.
[3:42:48.920 --> 3:42:49.920]  It's the audio of the video.
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:50.920]  It's up on infowars.com.
[3:42:50.920 --> 3:42:54.520]  A lot of you don't have internet, so I want to play this for you now.
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:42:59.920]  Before I do that, I wanted to let you know about the people that make this radio show
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:01.440]  possible.
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:09.720]  One of them is the Akola Blue folks, akolablu.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, big banner up on infowars.com,
[3:43:09.720 --> 3:43:15.360]  inprisonplanet.com, tubakolablu.com, atmospheric waters generator for the home, pays for itself
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:19.400]  in one year if you buy your water from the store, pure clean water without the fluoride
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:23.360]  and limited water from the humidity in the air, machine bridges up to 7.5 gallons a day,
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:27.880]  great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it, no chemicals, pollutants, or toxins,
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:28.880]  neutral pH.
[3:43:28.880 --> 3:43:30.880]  Then it goes through five filters after that.
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:33.240]  This is water that doesn't have fluoride in it, folks.
[3:43:33.240 --> 3:43:36.720]  It's hard to get that fluoride out, and it does it because there's none in the atmosphere.
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:48.720]  866-585-4044-1866-585-4044, or akolablu.com, you say you didn't get that number, 866-585-4044,
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:51.480]  akolablu.com.
[3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:58.640]  And I also wanted to then tell you about eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens group,
[3:43:58.640 --> 3:44:03.480]  the longest continually operated, storeable foods company, what is it, 27, 28 years now.
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:08.320]  It's where I've gotten food, it's where I've bought food to give to family who can't afford
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:09.320]  it.
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:11.200]  I mean, I have stockpiled food.
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:14.880]  I believe in this because I'm not going to trust in the government if there's a depression,
[3:44:14.880 --> 3:44:21.720]  a war, a bio weapons release, you know, Easter bunnies from Mars, landing, whatever.
[3:44:21.720 --> 3:44:22.720]  That's a joke.
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:25.640]  Somebody takes that out of context.
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:27.320]  I think that you should get swarble food.
[3:44:27.320 --> 3:44:35.880]  I think these are high quality folks in very affordable, great prices, 800-409-5633-800-4095633,
[3:44:35.880 --> 3:44:40.040]  or eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:45.560]  Put banner up on infowars.com.
[3:44:45.560 --> 3:44:47.120]  Let's go ahead and go to this.
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:51.600]  This is mixed in with the old audio tape from a year ago, E Howard Hunt, with the new video
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:55.400]  of E Howard Hunt, and then some more, never before heard, with his son speaking with myself
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:44:59.640]  and Jim Mars in Dallas a few months ago, we were up there taping.
[3:44:59.640 --> 3:45:04.040]  So this is a 14-minute piece, PrismPlanet.tv members, it's super clear and awesome.
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:08.440]  Everybody else, it's on YouTube, posted on infowars.com for you right now, and prismplanet.com.
[3:45:08.440 --> 3:45:10.200]  Here it is.
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:16.880]  First thing that came to me was the audio tape, which he sent to me in January of 2004.
[3:45:16.880 --> 3:45:21.880]  He didn't call me and let me know that he was sending it, but one day I just checked
[3:45:21.880 --> 3:45:26.360]  my mail, picked up my mail, and there was a package from my father.
[3:45:26.360 --> 3:45:30.320]  There was no explanation of what was on this tape, so I just put the tape in my cassette
[3:45:30.320 --> 3:45:38.120]  recorder, and in it he outlines his knowledge of the conspiracy, which was codenamed the
[3:45:38.120 --> 3:45:39.560]  Big Event.
[3:45:39.560 --> 3:45:46.040]  I was a bench warmer on it, and I had a reputation for honesty.
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:52.760]  I think it's a sense of a refocus on what this information that I've been providing
[3:45:52.760 --> 3:45:58.240]  you and you alone, by the way, consists of.
[3:45:58.240 --> 3:46:09.320]  What is important in the story is that we've backtracked the chain of command up through
[3:46:09.320 --> 3:46:18.360]  the cord wire and laying the doings at the doorstep of LBJ.
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:26.000]  He was sick, and he wrote this out, as you can see, by the handwriting with great difficulty.
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:32.080]  It's a little hard to read some of it, but at the top here we have the initials LBJ,
[3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:34.920]  which of course was the vice president at the time.
[3:46:34.920 --> 3:46:39.920]  Below this we have Cord Meyer, who was a CIA officer.
[3:46:39.920 --> 3:46:46.280]  Below that we have a name David Morales, who was also a CIA.
[3:46:46.280 --> 3:46:51.520]  I don't know if he was official CIA, but I certainly heard his name before in relation
[3:46:51.520 --> 3:46:53.800]  to contract work that he did with the CIA.
[3:46:53.800 --> 3:47:01.480]  I think he was a pretty serious guy, capable of doing just about anything.
[3:47:01.480 --> 3:47:07.960]  To the right, the next name is Bill Harvey, who was a very flamboyant CIA man, carried
[3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:13.000]  around a couple of pistols in his belt at all times, was a heavy drinker, and below
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:15.920]  at the bottom it says French gunman, grassy knoll.
[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:22.680]  I mean, you've said now that David Phillips apparently met with Oswald in Mexico City
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:24.880]  before the assassination.
[3:47:24.880 --> 3:47:32.240]  You've said that Bill Harvey may very well have recruited a French or Corsican gunman
[3:47:32.240 --> 3:47:38.040]  to shoot, and you've also said that Cord Meyer had a motive in that his pipe was having
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:40.400]  an affair with John F. Kennedy.
[3:47:40.400 --> 3:47:52.600]  I heard from Frank that LBJ had designated Cord Meyer Jr. to undertake a larger organization
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:56.040]  or keeping it totally secret.
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:48:08.360]  I think that LBJ settled on Meyer as an opportunist, a parent like himself, a parent, and a man
[3:48:08.360 --> 3:48:19.960]  who had very little left to him in life ever since JFK had taken Cord's wife as one of
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:30.440]  his mistresses, and of course, to that number Cord Meyer among JFK's admirers, quite the
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:31.440]  contrary.
[3:48:31.440 --> 3:48:37.960]  So now you have three CIA officials who had, let's say, the means, motive, and opportunity,
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:41.760]  or some connection to kill Kennedy.
[3:48:41.760 --> 3:48:43.960]  That's true.
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:54.480]  Johnson, as we all know, was a very corrupt president, very capable of doing evil deeds,
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:56.480]  don't you think?
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:48:57.480]  Unquestionably.
[3:48:57.480 --> 3:48:58.480]  Unquestionably.
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:05.400]  And if he wanted something done, he may have turned to someone like Bill Harvey, who was
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:10.480]  also extremely corrupt and a psycho, basically.
[3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:24.160]  Oh, yes, I could just visualize Harvey and LBJ forming a kind of a thieves compact between
[3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:25.160]  them.
[3:49:25.160 --> 3:49:38.640]  But I think that LBJ was an opportunist, and if it was not hesitated to get rid of obstacles
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:49.520]  in his way, I think his later career exemplified that the vice president had the most to gain.
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:50:00.600]  And he was in a position where he could bring in people like Cord Meyer and others of interest
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:09.800]  and get their take on different things and then, in turn, issue instructions.
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:22.160]  There was nobody with the leverage that LBJ had, no competitor, he was the vice president,
[3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:30.280]  and if he wanted to get rid of the president, then he had the ability to do so by corrupting
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:40.800]  different people in CIA, and he had to do it with the limitations of CIA, because there
[3:50:40.800 --> 3:50:49.800]  was no other group that honored, I could use that term, that honored the clandestine, the
[3:50:49.800 --> 3:50:53.640]  limitations the way CIA did.
[3:50:53.640 --> 3:51:02.440]  They could do something to turn their back on it and move on to something else.
[3:51:02.440 --> 3:51:06.240]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard earned money to fill your gas tank?
[3:51:06.240 --> 3:51:07.960]  Then do something about it.
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:11.920]  Fuel Savers Fuel Conditioner lets you drive further on each gallon of fuel, completely
[3:51:11.920 --> 3:51:13.520]  safe for all engines.
[3:51:13.520 --> 3:51:17.200]  Just add a small squeeze of product to your tank each time you fill up to improve your

[3:51:22.960 --> 3:51:28.000]  Each little two ounce squeeze bottle is highly concentrated and costs only $8 to treat 100
[3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:30.480]  gallons of gas or 50 gallons of diesel.

[3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:00.840]  Call now.
[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:04.320]  It is a big idea.
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:06.200]  A new world order.
[3:52:06.200 --> 3:52:10.920]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:52:10.920 --> 3:52:13.200]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:16.760]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:52:16.760 --> 3:52:22.160]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[3:52:22.160 --> 3:52:30.280]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand.

[3:53:55.600 --> 3:54:01.960]  it works.
[3:54:01.960 --> 3:54:08.000]  They could do something, turn their back on it, move on to something else, do not like
[3:54:08.000 --> 3:54:22.680]  a military, there was no accounting in that sense and we know LBJ had an unlimited ambition
[3:54:22.680 --> 3:54:30.600]  and we know that he was a corrupt individual and that the dollar sign was very important
[3:54:30.600 --> 3:54:31.600]  to him.
[3:54:31.600 --> 3:54:41.480]  As vice president, he didn't have the leverage that a president did or would and so that
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:45.840]  was an attractive goal for LBJ.
[3:54:45.840 --> 3:54:54.400]  He did not want his career to come to an end as vice president, who knows about vice presidents.
[3:54:54.400 --> 3:55:05.440]  It was very important to him that he take advantage as to the extent that he could as
[3:55:05.440 --> 3:55:11.320]  vice president because just a few things had to be accomplished.
[3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:21.480]  He had to kill Kennedy, have him kill LBJ and be guilt free himself and then he could
[3:55:21.480 --> 3:55:29.640]  go on and do what he wanted to do as president of the United States.
[3:55:29.640 --> 3:55:43.440]  It was a very tempting and almost a logical move on his part.
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:49.800]  I keep thinking about Bill Harvey, Bill Harvey and say, look, there are some things I want
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:59.720]  to have done, I mean Harvey didn't want just another and additional CIA salary, he wanted
[3:55:59.720 --> 3:56:08.840]  to move on and LBJ could do that for him if he were president.
[3:56:08.840 --> 3:56:16.560]  He couldn't do much for Harvey or anybody as vice president.
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:24.880]  That was why he used Harvey as being available and corrupt.
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:35.680]  It was very easy for even the vice president to start working with Harvey or anybody else.
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:45.680]  Just say, I want you to do this, I want you to do that and making sure that they had money
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:53.360]  that was not their own to do whatever the LBJ wanted to have done so that when the president
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:57:02.160]  was assassinated, the vice president was right there and ready to move along.
[3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:06.880]  It doesn't speak well for our democracy at that particular time.
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:18.200]  He, in my opinion, had an almost maniacal urge to become president, he regarded JFK as
[3:57:18.200 --> 3:57:19.200] ...
[3:57:19.200 --> 3:57:23.000]  There's about five, six minutes left and it goes back into the new footage and then it
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:28.360]  cuts back into the old audio, but this is very important, it needs to be seen.
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:33.560]  We heard about 60, 70% of it out here today, we've got hours and hours of it, but that's
[3:57:33.560 --> 3:57:34.560]  the main stuff.
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:38.040]  They're admitting they killed JFK there, that's the kind of stuff that will get a hit team
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:44.160]  down here, but footage is there and there's nothing new, government, there's nothing
[3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:45.160]  else.
[3:57:45.160 --> 3:57:51.080]  There it is, but we shouldn't have sat on it that long and we're going to put it in
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:57.720]  the film a lot more, but I'm just not going to let that sit around here, it needs to get
[3:57:57.720 --> 3:57:58.720]  out now.
[3:57:58.720 --> 3:58:03.320]  I think Robert Groden needs to not be sitting on the stuff he's got, I've seen it, it's
[3:58:03.320 --> 3:58:04.320]  unbelievable.
[3:58:04.320 --> 3:58:14.400]  A lot of folks coming out and say, we had Groden on for two and a half hours, roughly,
[3:58:14.400 --> 3:58:18.400]  and I covered a lot of news, of course, in the first hour as well on a host of important
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:22.200]  issues and took a bunch of phone calls, so that was a really good radio show today on
[3:58:22.200 --> 3:58:28.360]  this Thursday edition, the 23rd of October, 2008, and on the MNFM dial, we'll be back
[3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:32.080]  different times of the day at 9 on stations that air us on the internet, one place, rebroadcast
[3:58:32.080 --> 3:58:36.560]  right now, back in one minute, on the streams exclusively at infowars.com.
