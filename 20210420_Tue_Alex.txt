[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  I didn't do a April Fool's joke on April 1st.
[00:29.920 --> 00:35.040]  But on April 20th, I made a point with the headline that's going live here in just a
[00:35.040 --> 00:42.160]  few minutes, and it's that verdict reached in the Chauvin trial.
[00:42.160 --> 00:43.560]  Because the verdict's already been reached.
[00:43.560 --> 00:49.760]  The Democrats, the deep state, the globalists have this country primed to blow and to hold
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.760]  America hostage.
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.680]  So there's so much violence, so much shooting, so much killing, so much burning that when
[00:54.680 --> 00:59.080]  the mainstream media says somebody needs to be convicted, they will be convicted.
[00:59.080 --> 01:02.280]  And when the media decides to not cover something, they can get away with murder.
[01:02.280 --> 01:05.200]  They want control of the local police.
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.280]  That's what Soros and the deep state lost after their Bolsheviks 2.0.
[01:10.280 --> 01:12.480]  Soros admits he's a Bolshevik.
[01:12.480 --> 01:19.800]  Studied the Bolsheviks 100 years ago, 104 years ago, and you'll know everything you need to
[01:19.800 --> 01:20.800]  know.
[01:20.800 --> 01:22.120]  They admit their Bolsheviks.
[01:22.120 --> 01:24.880]  They admit their plan as Bolshevik.
[01:24.880 --> 01:30.360]  It's updated with the Maoist operation.
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.640]  The cop didn't want to go to jail.
[01:31.640 --> 01:33.000]  The cop didn't want to kill him.
[01:33.000 --> 01:34.600]  It was an out-of-control situation.
[01:34.600 --> 01:39.880]  So the cop hit in trouble for negligence of problems, sure, but that isn't the issue.
[01:39.880 --> 01:41.200]  We're being held hostage.
[01:41.200 --> 01:47.760]  So no matter whether he gets convicted or not, this country's now being held hostage.
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.480]  And here's some of the locals frothing after Maxine Waters came and basically told them
[01:52.480 --> 01:55.480]  to go out and be violent, saying, we're in control now.
[01:55.480 --> 01:56.880]  This is the Bolshevik model.
[01:56.880 --> 01:57.880]  The French Revolution model.
[01:57.880 --> 01:58.880]  Here it is.
[01:58.880 --> 01:59.880]  They don't find them guilty, man.
[01:59.880 --> 02:00.880]  They're going to tear this town up.
[02:00.880 --> 02:01.880]  We're going to say it just like that.
[02:01.880 --> 02:02.880]  We're going to tear this town up.
[02:02.880 --> 02:03.880]  Hey, I'm Lisa with The Daily Caller.
[02:03.880 --> 02:13.440]  Today we are in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, where Dante Wright was fatally shot, and we're
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.960]  asking people what they expect the city to look like if Derek Chauvin is found not guilty
[02:18.960 --> 02:19.960]  of murder.
[02:19.960 --> 02:20.960]  Let's see what they say.
[02:20.960 --> 02:23.640]  What do you think he's going to look like if Chauvin is found not guilty of?
[02:23.640 --> 02:25.160]  Oh, y'all, we're going to be f***ed up.
[02:25.160 --> 02:28.200]  If those cops get off, not only will they burn downtown down, they're going to burn
[02:28.200 --> 02:29.200]  all of downtown down.
[02:29.200 --> 02:30.200]  I think it'll burn.
[02:30.200 --> 02:31.200]  Businesses are going to burn again.
[02:31.200 --> 02:32.200]  A lot are going to get broken into.
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.520]  It looked like it did before, when they killed them.
[02:35.520 --> 02:37.320]  I look like Minneapolis dad.
[02:37.320 --> 02:38.320]  Straight like that.
[02:38.320 --> 02:39.320]  It will.
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.240]  If he's found not guilty, maybe it needs to burn.
[02:41.240 --> 02:42.640]  It's going to be chaos either way.
[02:42.640 --> 02:43.640]  I'm scared.
[02:43.640 --> 02:46.800]  I think it'll probably be worse than it was the past couple of nights for sure.
[02:46.800 --> 02:47.800]  They do.
[02:47.800 --> 02:48.800]  What they do?
[02:48.800 --> 02:49.800]  Yeah.
[02:49.800 --> 02:50.800]  Go ahead and go.
[02:50.800 --> 02:51.800]  Go ahead and about to finish.
[02:51.800 --> 02:53.840]  They wipe out the next person real quick.
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.840]  They call it, uh, go appeal.
[02:55.840 --> 02:58.480]  Yeah, go up for an appeal.
[02:58.480 --> 03:01.200]  Probably the exact same as it was last summer.
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.120]  We shouldn't be standing right here having no f***ing conversation because if they use
[03:05.120 --> 03:08.320]  their training and the stuff that they're supposed to do, this f*** wouldn't constantly
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.320]  be happening.
[03:09.320 --> 03:10.320]  But they don't give a f***.
[03:10.320 --> 03:11.320]  Look, look at their training.
[03:11.320 --> 03:13.520]  Oh, it's the tazer and you shot him a f***er.
[03:13.520 --> 03:14.520]  Look at their training.
[03:14.520 --> 03:16.040]  You put a knee on him on a f***ing neck and you killed somebody.
[03:16.040 --> 03:17.040]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:17.040 --> 03:19.640]  Like, what kind of f***ing training is this?
[03:19.640 --> 03:20.640]  You know, this ain't training.
[03:20.640 --> 03:22.200]  This ain't no f***ing training.
[03:22.200 --> 03:31.080]  I would not feel at rest just if those charges, you know, he was found guilty.
[03:31.080 --> 03:33.720]  I wouldn't expect anybody to feel at ease with that.
[03:33.720 --> 03:38.920]  They killed our own love, you know, and he's just trying to get away so he don't get killed
[03:38.920 --> 03:39.920]  and shot him in the car.
[03:39.920 --> 03:41.240]  I can't watch any more of this.
[03:41.240 --> 03:45.960]  It goes on and on and this is just the tip of the iceberg and the always liberal women
[03:45.960 --> 03:50.680]  double triple mask, got another big study out how it kills you wearing a mask, but they
[03:50.680 --> 03:51.680]  don't care.
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.520]  They love the ignorance and these black guys don't care about 2,000 dead black people in
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.160]  Chicago at the hands of black people and like 20 people dead at the hands of white people,
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.160]  black people.
[04:01.160 --> 04:04.600]  No, it's all about feeling good because the media tells you so and going out there and
[04:04.600 --> 04:10.160]  acting like idiots when meanwhile thousands of people are dying a day of fentanyl overdoses
[04:10.160 --> 04:12.560]  just like George Floyd did.
[04:12.560 --> 04:15.160]  But the media tells you when to get upset.
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.960]  They don't tell you to get upset about all the black people dying from the vaccine that's
[04:17.960 --> 04:18.960]  poisoned.
[04:18.960 --> 04:21.600]  They don't tell you to worry about the tens of millions starving to death all over the
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.120]  third world, most of them Africa from the great reset.
[04:24.120 --> 04:26.160]  No, because you don't care about that.
[04:26.160 --> 04:29.920]  You like to feel like they're part of the establishment and part of the media when the
[04:29.920 --> 04:36.400]  big banks and the universities and CNN, MSNBC and a rich congresswoman take a lot and burn
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.280]  stuff down when she's on the payroll of the communist Chinese that run giant death camps
[04:41.280 --> 04:42.760]  killing millions of people.
[04:42.760 --> 04:44.600]  But you don't care about that.
[04:44.600 --> 04:49.280]  You just care about feeling good all day and buying into leftist race war because you're
[04:49.280 --> 04:50.280]  dumbasses.
[04:50.280 --> 04:52.880]  Well, right back I'm Alex Jones.
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.880]  This is the Info War.
[04:53.880 --> 04:55.880]  You've already got the verdict.
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.120]  America's a joke.
[04:58.120 --> 05:00.720]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[05:00.720 --> 05:04.400]  They're creating insecurity, crime, war and famine.
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.080]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our
[05:09.080 --> 05:11.560]  family's sakes, but also our community.

[05:16.760 --> 05:18.280]  lowest price you're going to find.

[06:10.160 --> 06:32.600]  Well, I didn't do an April Fool's on April Fool's, I never do it, but I did one today.
[06:32.600 --> 06:39.560]  Watch live, verdict reached in Chobon Trial, America is being divided and conquered.
[06:39.560 --> 06:43.640]  That's the verdict, but really it's not even tongue in cheek, it's a straightforward thing.
[06:43.640 --> 06:50.280]  It doesn't matter in the scheme of things about George Floyd or about Chobon.
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.480]  They're both humans, they're both have red blood, God made them both, I mean they matter
[06:53.480 --> 06:56.920]  to God, but to the globalists they don't matter.
[06:56.920 --> 06:59.120]  They're just pawns in this game.
[06:59.120 --> 07:06.200]  I guarantee it, George Floyd didn't want to get addicted to methamphetamine and to fentanyl
[07:06.200 --> 07:08.920]  and I guarantee you the cop that turned out was friends with him and worked at the same
[07:08.920 --> 07:16.600]  club with him, didn't want to kill him, but they're humans and so we're flawed and things
[07:16.600 --> 07:21.700]  go wrong and bad things happen, but now the media can sit there and divide and conquer
[07:21.700 --> 07:24.000]  us and control us.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.560]  Turns out they've gone to the former home, I'll cover it next segment, guys got my article
[07:28.560 --> 07:35.960]  after the printer, thanks, of one of the defense witnesses, went to his home, had lived there
[07:35.960 --> 07:41.600]  in two years, threw a dead pig head on his property, on the former property and spread
[07:41.600 --> 07:48.600]  blood all over it, we'll show you all that coming up next segment, there's some of it
[07:48.600 --> 07:57.920]  right there, Barry Brode's former residence and they went to the other jurors' homes
[07:57.920 --> 08:06.200]  because CBS doxxed them yesterday, CBS said here's who they are so you can go harass them
[08:06.200 --> 08:10.400]  because the corporate media that sells you all these illegal wars and Chinese slave
[08:10.400 --> 08:15.360]  camps and we need to change the gender of our little boys and that the nuclear family
[08:15.360 --> 08:19.600]  needs to be ended for black people, hell that was the goal of the great society, now they
[08:19.600 --> 08:27.440]  just admit it, they want power over us to decide who gets convicted and who doesn't,
[08:27.440 --> 08:33.400]  they don't want a jury half of which is black, unprecedented, per capita it should be one
[08:33.400 --> 08:41.760]  black person if you go off race on that jury, but it's half black and they're going to their
[08:41.760 --> 08:47.640]  houses too saying we don't trust you to look at the evidence and decide whether we're going
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.240]  to put this guy in jail for the rest of his life, we're going to burn everything down
[08:53.240 --> 08:59.600]  and we're going to come to your houses if you don't do what we say, now the American
[08:59.600 --> 09:03.840]  response is I'm going to do the right thing off the evidence and I'm going to ignore your
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.680]  terrorism, but let me tell you something, a lot of Americans don't act like that and
[09:08.680 --> 09:13.880]  don't behave like that, I've been involved in jury trials, I've been involved in situations
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.240]  we later learned where the media got involved in contact with the jurors and said if you
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.280]  don't do the right thing we're going to doctor ass, that's how corrupt the corporate media is,
[09:23.280 --> 09:32.080]  they're not media, they're terrorists, they're the enemies of this country and they're the
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.080]  ones that cover up the government chipping in drugs in the black neighborhoods, they're
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.560]  the ones covering up the black on black crime, they're the ones covering up the veterans
[09:40.560 --> 09:47.920]  commit suicide 20 plus a day, they're the ones deindustrializing our nation, they're
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.520]  the ones putting up 5G, they're the ones poisoning us, they're the ones bringing illegal aliens
[09:52.520 --> 09:59.960]  and giving them $15,000 when citizens get nothing as we go bankrupt, they're the enemy,
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.080]  they work for the foreign banks, they work for the ultra rich, they work for the establishment
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.480]  and when you go along with the mainstream media or the universities or the power structure
[10:08.480 --> 10:18.520]  or Hollywood, you're working for the man, the bad man, the globalist man, the new world
[10:18.520 --> 10:26.240]  order man and that's a fact, so I don't give a rat's behind what color you are, what I
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.160]  care about, what's going on between your ears and the new world order hates every one of
[10:32.160 --> 10:38.680]  us because they serve the wicked one that came to kill, steal and destroy God's creation
[10:38.680 --> 10:45.200]  and it's time to transcend this divide and conquer and come together and understand what's
[10:45.200 --> 10:49.360]  going to happen but I can tell you Drew Hernandez is going to be popping on tonight during a
[10:49.360 --> 10:52.720]  special broadcast when this verdict comes out, it could be tonight, tomorrow, it could
[10:52.720 --> 10:57.440]  be in 10 minutes, it could be in 5 minutes but the fact that you're watching mainstream
[10:57.440 --> 11:06.480]  media, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, hype this up and say if we don't get justice, a loaded question,
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.080]  what do we do if he isn't convicted?
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.880]  Well we burn this son of a bitch and Maxine Waters out there with her virtual singlin
[11:12.880 --> 11:21.320]  mask and her face mask, all crazy eyed, is emblematic of this national possession that
[11:21.320 --> 11:30.280]  we're under, we need a national exorcism, so we've already got riots and burnings and
[11:30.280 --> 11:37.160]  police stations getting shot up and burned all over the country and Maxine Waters said
[11:37.160 --> 11:43.000]  well that's what civil rights looks like but she doesn't say a word about 3 million Muslims
[11:43.000 --> 11:51.640]  and death camps, a million Christians and death camps, a million Buddhists and death camps.
[11:51.640 --> 11:56.160]  No, no, no, no, no, she'll pick one of the 14 black men killed each year in a wrongful
[11:56.160 --> 12:03.600]  situation out of 350 million people and she'll make a huge deal about that all day and act
[12:03.600 --> 12:09.600]  like that's all the world's problems to distract from the fact that she's a monster that sold
[12:09.600 --> 12:17.440]  out to China 30 years ago and deindustrialized this country and that she promotes Planned
[12:17.440 --> 12:24.600]  Parenthood that was established to kill black people, do you imagine if I set up a group
[12:24.600 --> 12:31.080]  that's mission was to quote kill black weeds, kill black subhumans, that's who she works
[12:31.080 --> 12:37.080]  with, that's who she really funds and I see what they've done to black people and everybody
[12:37.080 --> 12:42.200]  else that matter, they just started on them so they're farther down than us, you think
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.480]  I feel strong as a human watching them brainwashed, dumbed down, drugged out, dying, killing
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.080]  each other, it makes me feel like a sack of garbage but to people like her and the Democrats
[12:51.080 --> 12:55.680]  and Joe Biden that passed the laws to if a black guy gets busted with drugs he gets three
[12:55.680 --> 13:01.360]  times the sentence of a white person to those real elitists because they're beyond racist,
[13:01.360 --> 13:08.160]  they're elitist, they see us as animals, they see us weak and falling apart and dying and
[13:08.160 --> 13:15.440]  going bankrupt, they see that it makes them feel big inside, makes them feel strong because
[13:15.440 --> 13:18.720]  the truth is they're falling and they're ugly and they're stupid and they're bad, these
[13:18.720 --> 13:21.560]  globalists, they're black, they're white, they're Christian, they're Catholic, they're
[13:21.560 --> 13:26.800]  Jewish, they're Muslim, they're chai-com, they're everything, they're from all our groups but
[13:26.800 --> 13:35.120]  they're of their father, the dirty lion-stinking loser-ass devil that's a loser so he wants
[13:35.120 --> 13:43.680]  to take the world with him and all his children are exactly the same so I think my lucky stars
[13:43.680 --> 13:49.760]  and I think Jesus Christ and his father that I'm not in the same club as Hillary and I'm
[13:49.760 --> 13:58.160]  not in the same club as any of these devil worship and knuckle dragon animals but kiss
[13:58.160 --> 14:03.360]  in the ass of the left and kiss in the ass of idiots whether they be black or white or
[14:03.360 --> 14:07.440]  Hispanic, running around spouting leftist talking points like it's some magic they've

[18:33.760 --> 18:39.120]  souls who love liberty who are indomitable and who have a fighting spirit it just makes me feel
[18:39.120 --> 18:44.880]  strong and it was really great and oakheath turned to me at the dinner and he said hey we're gonna
[18:44.880 --> 18:51.280]  give you a big exclusive tomorrow we're gonna actually let you break it at 11 a.m and it's
[18:51.280 --> 18:54.880]  another terrorist they caught at the border and and a cover up of what happened they were giving
[18:54.880 --> 19:02.160]  the internal documents that is breaking in 10 minutes at info wars.com and news wars.com and
[19:02.160 --> 19:07.440]  it's going to be breaking simultaneously over a project veritas and so we're uploading the video
[19:07.440 --> 19:15.680]  report uh that uh they gave us last night right now to band.video that is coming up but as we
[19:15.680 --> 19:24.720]  sit here and watch the chauvin show trial and experts harassed jurors homes visited the media
[19:24.720 --> 19:30.080]  threatening them cbs doxing them i mean this is levels of criminal activity never seen in the us
[19:31.200 --> 19:38.320]  while they throw the book at journalists like our journalist sam who went in the capital peacefully
[19:38.320 --> 19:47.120]  and shot the entire situation peacefully cnn's allowed to be inside national geographies allowed
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.320]  to be inside he's not because he's a trump supporter he didn't break in the police wavy men
[19:53.120 --> 19:58.960]  but they want to put him in prison for seven years but jade necks well they've already
[19:58.960 --> 20:02.800]  let him out and aren't doing anything to him because he's anti-fun he was paid by singing in to go in
[20:02.800 --> 20:08.720]  and say let's burn this mother effort down of course cnn hired him because he's black so they
[20:08.720 --> 20:13.920]  can blame black people when stuff burns down that's in the antifa documents we got three years ago
[20:14.480 --> 20:19.600]  from 2015 we got him a few years after that where obama was trying to get antifa to train
[20:19.600 --> 20:26.720]  to prepare blacks to burn down cities so blacks would get the blame man with friends like that
[20:26.720 --> 20:32.880]  who needs enemies ladies and gentlemen and so that's all the manipulation but i want to shift gears
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.280]  into this right now and i think the best place to start is with a very important
[20:43.360 --> 20:46.480]  report by greg reese that's in the greg reese section
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.200]  of band.video and all of this after i play this report will tie
[20:53.200 --> 21:04.000]  into this article on info wars.com by administration bans ice and cpb from using
[21:04.000 --> 21:12.160]  dehumanizing language such as illegal alien under latin the roman said if someone was
[21:12.160 --> 21:17.760]  from outside it just means alien not not not of the group in foreign countries in mexico they call
[21:17.760 --> 21:23.920]  you an alien you put on the paperwork that's how it is but now they've already taught us to call
[21:23.920 --> 21:27.600]  these people all migrants but they're the ones dehumanizing they're the ones traveling they're
[21:27.600 --> 21:31.440]  the ones in the senate report from five and a half years ago admitting that 10 000 plus children
[21:31.440 --> 21:38.160]  in one survey were placed with smugglers and sex traffickers some were killed so if you humanize
[21:38.160 --> 21:41.360]  them and actually want to know what's going on with them you're dehumanizing and pointing out this
[21:41.360 --> 21:45.200]  is all illegal this is all smuggling like when we caught the smuggler packing kids in the back of
[21:45.200 --> 21:49.040]  the car they go hey we're allowed to do this now don't call us a smuggler even though it's still
[21:49.040 --> 21:56.320]  illegal they're just saying hey except it's not like drag queen story time or topless bars now
[21:56.320 --> 22:00.640]  having adult men dressed as women like clowns they're not dressed like women having small
[22:00.640 --> 22:04.720]  children get up on stage as they shout profanities at them and tell them they want to have sex with
[22:04.720 --> 22:11.120]  them and stick money in little boys dressed like girls g-strings at midnight but this isn't sexual
[22:11.120 --> 22:18.080]  abuse no this isn't something out of a nightmare no disgusting video shows children being paraded
[22:18.080 --> 22:24.480]  around and dragged show cash tips being thrown at them that ties him with hollywood movie star
[22:24.480 --> 22:29.360]  the star of the past of the christ exposes a dream of chrome and child sex trafficking
[22:29.360 --> 22:34.080]  and we commend his courage the videos at band dot video it's your mission to share the video
[22:34.080 --> 22:40.720]  if you choose to accept your mission here's the report if you were to watch shinler's list
[22:40.720 --> 22:45.600]  he would say boy that was terrible i wish i was around that i maybe i could have done something
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.520]  you can do something now because they're pulling kids out of the darkest recesses of hell right now
[22:51.520 --> 22:56.560]  and dums and all kinds of places uh the adrenochroming of children
[23:01.120 --> 23:08.960]  actor jim caviesel is being ridiculed and defamed in the mainstream news for speaking out against
[23:08.960 --> 23:16.240]  child trafficking while promoting his new film sound of freedom based on the true story of former
[23:16.240 --> 23:22.000]  u.s. government agent tim ballard who quit his job to devote his life to rescuing children
[23:22.000 --> 23:30.400]  from global sex traffickers jim caviesel described what adrenochrome is essentially you have
[23:30.400 --> 23:37.760]  adrenaline in your body i'll just simplify it and when you are scared you produce adrenaline uh if
[23:37.760 --> 23:43.920]  you're an athlete you get in the fourth quarter you have adrenaline that comes out of you if a child
[23:43.920 --> 23:52.160]  knows he's going to die his body will secrete this adrenaline um and they have a lot of terms that
[23:52.160 --> 24:00.000]  they use the mockingbird media responded by firing a chorus of headlines into the brainwashed minds
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.640]  of the public all to the tune of adrenochrome and the consumption of children is a dangerous
[24:06.640 --> 24:14.800]  right wing lie but it isn't millions of people waking up from the generational sleepy lie of
[24:14.800 --> 24:23.040]  pop culture are seeing the ugly truth seeing the millions of babies aborted each year sold
[24:23.040 --> 24:30.080]  for fetal body parts seeing old women rub aborted fetal tissue into their skin to appear younger
[24:30.080 --> 24:37.600]  and seeing official science comparing young blood to the fountain of youth it doesn't matter how
[24:37.600 --> 24:45.680]  many times the lying fake news media decries q anon conspiracy theorists or right wingers
[24:46.720 --> 24:53.280]  millions are now seeing what they have been busy hiding the trafficking of children slavery
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.840]  caviesel warned that the film may never be seen because there are very famous people in hollywood
[24:59.840 --> 25:06.880]  involved in child trafficking and once they see the ships that they transport the children and
[25:06.880 --> 25:13.360]  and all of this stuff um well there's there's no other film like this our industry can't make this
[25:13.360 --> 25:20.240]  film um right now because of a lot of people that are involved in it all over the world that are in
[25:20.240 --> 25:28.480]  this um and many of these people are very famous he even mentioned dums because they're pulling
[25:28.480 --> 25:35.680]  kids out of the darkest decreases of hell right now and dums and all kinds of places deep underground
[25:35.680 --> 25:43.360]  military bases which we were warned about in 1995 by former government engineer turned whistleblower
[25:43.360 --> 25:50.560]  phil schneider people have always been telling us this ugly truth alec jones and david ike
[25:50.560 --> 25:58.800]  william cooper manly p hall all the way back to Aristotle and now it's all coming out into the
[25:58.800 --> 26:06.320]  open the apocalypse the revealing of what was once hidden like playdoh's allegory of the cave
[26:06.960 --> 26:13.520]  there are millions who keep themselves ignorantly buried in the mainstream lie but millions of us
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.560]  are awakening to the evil truth and we demand justice and these people that do it um
[26:20.560 --> 26:43.120]  um there'll be no mercy for them for info wars dot com this is greg reese
[26:50.880 --> 27:01.600]  i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes info
[27:01.600 --> 27:07.200]  wars has had if you're paying attention you know we've done together but i'll tell you this
[27:08.640 --> 27:15.040]  the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms
[27:15.040 --> 27:21.600]  of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time to understand
[27:21.600 --> 27:25.520]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you warned your friends and
[27:25.520 --> 27:31.040]  family about us around to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structures
[27:31.040 --> 27:38.480]  of silence those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us
[27:38.480 --> 27:45.600]  we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we have
[27:45.600 --> 27:51.120]  to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come so be the
[27:51.120 --> 28:01.280]  polar bears you are in the early 1990s it was a really funny movie that came out called wanes world
[28:01.280 --> 28:10.480]  even before i had access to your show in the mid 1990s i wouldn't call that movie and thought man
[28:10.480 --> 28:16.160]  that was fun to speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining
[28:16.160 --> 28:23.840]  because you're real well what do they say in wanes world we're not worthy we're not worthy every day
[28:23.840 --> 28:28.160]  when i cover these huge topics i don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge
[28:28.160 --> 28:31.920]  are so real but i'm trying to tell you the truth i'm trying to get it right and most of time we
[28:31.920 --> 28:38.000]  do the globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.600]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and and using people's ignorance against them that for me is really
[28:43.600 --> 28:48.480]  such a disgusting so you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew
[28:49.840 --> 28:54.480]  but we will never join the globalists we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know
[28:54.480 --> 29:03.600]  we're all in this together granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go
[29:03.600 --> 29:09.600]  ahead challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the
[29:09.600 --> 29:14.640]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[29:14.640 --> 29:20.560]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[29:20.560 --> 29:28.080]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[29:28.080 --> 29:32.720]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.200]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen
[29:37.200 --> 29:43.600]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket
[29:43.600 --> 29:49.440]  this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put it on derma blend anymore
[29:49.440 --> 29:54.640]  you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[29:56.320 --> 30:04.480]  epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association
[30:04.480 --> 30:09.440]  and they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in
[30:09.440 --> 30:14.640]  massive censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their
[30:14.640 --> 30:19.280]  services so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website
[30:19.280 --> 30:24.720]  or want servers or any other major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to
[30:24.720 --> 30:31.040]  info wars domains dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price
[30:31.040 --> 30:36.880]  and 25 percent of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war
[30:36.880 --> 30:41.440]  and then we get five percent as well for any servers or any other type of services that you
[30:41.440 --> 30:46.560]  get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[30:46.560 --> 30:52.560]  are destroying what was open and what was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution
[30:52.560 --> 30:56.000]  starts there info wars domains dot com take action now

[34:03.920 --> 34:11.600]  bakari a known associate of four yemen's on the terrorist watch list was traveling through panama
[34:11.600 --> 34:17.680]  uh with them before being encountered at the mexicali airport in mexico on monday april 12th
[34:17.680 --> 34:23.680]  now al bakari was then released into the general public by the government of mexico and us customs
[34:23.680 --> 34:28.080]  and border patrol anticipates that al bakari will be encountered at the us southern border within the
[34:28.080 --> 34:33.840]  next several days that means that this guy is going to be encountered at the us mexico border
[34:33.840 --> 34:40.000]  and this document we've redacted some bits of it here but it actually shows his face it's a
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.640]  unclassified document but what titled law enforcement sensitive we've seen that uh
[34:45.360 --> 34:49.520]  that nomenclature on a lot of these documents obtained from our insiders now this is extremely
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.560]  concerning considering the state and crisis at our southern border just last week two other yemen
[34:54.560 --> 34:58.480]  nationals on the fbis terrorism watch list were arrested after illegally crossing the border for
[34:58.480 --> 35:04.320]  mexico into california even al bakari's brother who is also on the terrorism watch list supposedly
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.320]  works at burger king in mexicali mexico just south of california on the border now they say it's
[35:10.320 --> 35:16.400]  not a crisis but when people associated with those on the terrorism watch list are about to cross
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.800]  the border we'd say that's a crisis i just got a message from one of our insiders at the customs
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.800]  and border patrol uh this person says quote we're processing the people flooding our border
[35:26.800 --> 35:32.880]  while watching your cnn videos and laughing so we appreciate our insiders and whistleblowers
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.520]  inside uh the u.s and customs and border protection department of homeland security keep it coming
[35:37.520 --> 35:50.880]  guys we'll keep the videos coming again the full report is at info wars dot com very pleased
[35:50.880 --> 35:58.480]  and honored to be working directly with project veritas and the amazing work they do well you've
[35:58.480 --> 36:05.280]  got your diamond and the system is definitely scared of all the work that we are doing here
[36:05.280 --> 36:14.800]  together so my message to the new world order is don't play with me don't play with us because
[36:14.800 --> 36:35.280]  you're playing with fire and now the globalists want to burn down america they want to hold
[36:35.280 --> 36:46.160]  the police or the government hostage so they roll over a lot of mar they're playing with fire
[36:46.160 --> 36:52.960]  with fire now aren't they fire has a way of getting away from me we have blown back hurting you real
[36:52.960 --> 37:02.480]  bad that's why i don't play with fire because what did old george washington say old george
[37:02.480 --> 37:15.040]  our leader what'd he say he said fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
[37:17.840 --> 37:24.720]  but you're the ones playing with fire you're the one letting it out of the box and you don't control
[37:24.720 --> 37:35.200]  it and those that release the fire are almost always the ones burned by the fire must respect
[37:35.200 --> 37:42.400]  the fire and you must keep the fire in arms length but those of you that embrace the fire
[37:43.520 --> 37:51.840]  of 666 will be burned by the fire you cannot contain the fire you are not in command of the fire
[37:51.840 --> 37:59.520]  play with me because you're playing with fire you want to play god you're not
[38:01.760 --> 38:08.000]  now let's speak of that devil these three articles at info wars.com and band off video
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.480]  all tied together inexorably disgusting video that is hard for me to watch you're lucky if
[38:14.480 --> 38:19.360]  you're a radio listener shows children and by the way when we air stuff like this this is not
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.160]  even the really bad stuff where grown men with erections have glitter on their genitals in austin
[38:27.520 --> 38:32.480]  at public events and children hop up and down on it and then we air that and stations go hey
[38:32.480 --> 38:36.240]  we're going to drop your show if you air that i go i call up the station managers i've done this
[38:36.240 --> 38:40.960]  many times i agree with you that's very obscene that was done in downtown austin out in the middle
[38:40.960 --> 38:47.760]  of downtown it was done in a hotel in a hotel ballroom um you know pbs shows kids hit by napalm

[38:52.080 --> 38:57.360]  think i like looking at that they're doing it to little kids what am i supposed to do but the
[38:57.360 --> 39:03.520]  station said we understand just people can't handle it okay i could show this video there's no
[39:03.520 --> 39:10.160]  naked kids or naked men on this this is men hooping and hollering at a strip club at night
[39:11.840 --> 39:14.960]  and you've got some black woman that going thinking this is cute and fun
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.680]  because hollywood max like men and drag is such a cool thing because they were preparing you for
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.240]  the priest class these globalists dressed up like clowns and they tell you in all the videos we see

[42:35.920 --> 42:43.120]  be hated of all nations for my namesake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[42:43.120 --> 42:48.640]  and shall hate one another right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.520]  founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created

[47:29.360 --> 47:35.280]  with people and i remember there were like 12 13 14 year old kids there they didn't look too happy
[47:35.280 --> 47:40.480]  to be there so see there's this whole societal thing like bob hope dresses up like a woman they
[47:40.480 --> 47:45.360]  do it at bohemian grove they have all these movies about drag queens and how cool they are and you
[47:45.360 --> 47:49.120]  know it's a fun stunt see we crowded did it and it's funny i didn't thought about doing it because

[47:53.840 --> 47:58.880]  but the way the media desensitize this now if you look at dragly story time around the world
[47:58.880 --> 48:02.800]  not just here in front of the rock and faller foundation uh bill gates funds it as well it's
[48:02.800 --> 48:10.400]  come out through subsidiaries it's like really gross looking dudes well like clowns like demons and
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.520]  then the kids sit in their laps and they and the men make all these weird faces like and you've seen
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.240]  the videos we played them and they pull out babies out of their stomachs bleeding fake babies
[48:20.240 --> 48:27.760]  maybe roll that if you can find it i mean you can't it's really satanic it's it's it's very macabre and
[48:29.840 --> 48:33.840]  yeah this is from footage in austin when stations complain about this so don't don't show the part
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.480]  with the guy totally naked with glitter with children humping him i mean but it's like a dude
[48:39.120 --> 48:45.120]  with a major slong and there's kids riding him but he's got glitter on his genitals so it's oh it's
[48:45.120 --> 48:51.840]  covered i mean this is all illegal and so i just couldn't imagine being a child and being around
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.080]  these because it's it's a pack of lunatics i mean they're all on drugs they're on all sorts of crazy
[48:56.080 --> 49:04.320]  hormones uh they're doing all sorts of insane things and i've been around it for 15 minutes
[49:05.680 --> 49:12.320]  and it made me physically sick and we ran out of there and got away yeah watch this this was
[49:12.320 --> 49:18.720]  praised by the media a few years ago uh this person says they're a devil worshiper uh he says
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.200]  he's a woman and he pulls out the baby and kills it then drinks the blood so so but this is what's
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.160]  really going on that's called lesser magic they show you publicly what they're doing or what they
[49:28.160 --> 49:34.080]  desire internally and it's about a man saying i'm a woman and by saying he's a woman he takes over
[49:34.080 --> 49:38.000]  that power and then says i'm gonna kill the baby and these women sit around and act like it's really
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.880]  sexy and it's powerful and they and these men all out what they're getting off on it like this is
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.240]  really avant-garde this is really so they live off our free society live off the largesse and they
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.760]  just do whatever they want with like two-year-old girls having big fat men come up and shake their
[49:53.760 --> 49:58.560]  ass in their face so let's go ahead and show the latest video of them i want to have sex with you

[51:23.120 --> 51:28.080]  being caught again in the cover up but this whole ties in with hollywood movie starage
[51:28.080 --> 51:32.800]  exposes adrenochrome and child sex trafficking and the media demonizes even hell they keep babies
[51:32.800 --> 51:36.880]  alive and sell their organs governor north of admits that this is all hiding in plain view
[51:37.520 --> 51:42.960]  and richard docum's cancel is 1996 humorous the year effort tweets about transgenders and the
[51:42.960 --> 51:54.240]  attack on women's rights so is jk rallying so is all of them it's simply the takeover of our
[51:54.240 --> 51:59.840]  civilization let me tell you who we got coming up for you today having had him on in probably five
[51:59.840 --> 52:05.840]  six years he's a medical doctor a zoologist made major discoveries help educate me about so much
[52:05.840 --> 52:11.840]  dr joel wall it's going to be popping in on a host of issues that norm paddock constitutional

[52:21.760 --> 52:29.680]  surface on a lot of this key information so far but let me just real quick throw this out at

[52:37.520 --> 52:43.520]  and we've done things in the past ended up having a huge effect i guess i took in game
[52:43.520 --> 52:48.800]  off my desk somebody bring me an in-game police thanks but we are offering my film that's been
[52:48.800 --> 52:52.720]  censored and been blocked and been attacked and been taken off amazon when it was number one
[52:54.560 --> 52:59.280]  and so i thought hey i'm gonna print 20 000 copies of this bad boy and i'm gonna sell them for 395
[52:59.280 --> 53:03.600]  a piece we figure that'll help fund the operation but you sell them as close to cost as we can
[53:03.600 --> 53:10.160]  and we've almost sold out of the 20 000 copies so bravo folks bravo
[53:12.080 --> 53:19.280]  they buy one for 14 95 buy two for nine 95 each three for eight 95 five for eight
[53:19.280 --> 53:27.360]  for five 95 five copies for five 95 a piece or 10 for 395 a piece and most people i salute you are
[53:27.360 --> 53:35.040]  buying 10 a big nice hd dvd with all the extras exposing the whole great reset the whole new
[53:35.040 --> 53:40.320]  world order operation and it's got a zero country code it plays anywhere in the world and there's no

[53:45.360 --> 53:48.560]  go to your church go everywhere and say hey you're not supposed to see this it's been banned you've
[53:48.560 --> 53:54.080]  heard alex jones from demon eyes he predicted and laid out their whole great reset using a fake virus
[53:54.080 --> 53:59.440]  14 years ago with their own documents this is the film and people it's already printed on the top
[53:59.440 --> 54:04.160]  of twitter like five times last month or so best alex jones was right hashtag alex jones was right
[54:05.360 --> 54:10.480]  this is what i was right about this this people are really freaking out over end game because
[54:10.480 --> 54:14.320]  that you watch it and they go is this real time how do you know i didn't i don't get the credit
[54:15.680 --> 54:19.120]  god gets the credit for touching my heart and going after the globalists in their own research
[54:19.120 --> 54:24.240]  so if you wonder how i know all the stuff before it's in in game and i call it operation in game
[54:24.240 --> 54:32.000]  and i just ordered 20 000 more of these bad boys today so that is great great news 20 000 of these
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.560]  in the last uh it's like 15 000 last week the 5000 are about to sell out but that's okay it only
[54:38.560 --> 54:44.960]  takes a week they're gonna print it up in a good old-fashioned chicago america it's all american

[58:02.400 --> 58:09.120]  it's time to read mad maxine the riot act she stepped in it because everybody says she's
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.560]  supposed to go to prison if he walks with all the drugs in the capital well she says burn
[58:12.560 --> 58:18.800]  everything down she says getting people's faces she says get more aggressive oh people have logic
[58:18.800 --> 58:25.440]  that's not working all of these young children who are next to each other six inches apart many
[58:25.440 --> 58:32.720]  without masks by the way does that follow your guidance that you've issued no well then why would
[58:32.720 --> 58:38.160]  the biden administration not go and stop this instead of the establishment sending their
[58:38.160 --> 58:42.560]  associates to the border they are instead aiding and abetting the future destruction
[58:42.560 --> 58:47.840]  and death toll in minneapolis and other major cities that have long been on a razor's edge
[58:47.840 --> 58:52.320]  well national guard troops providing security for residents in the area of penn avenue and
[58:52.320 --> 58:58.400]  broadway in minneapolis this morning were shot at at 4 19 a.m the guard says the gunshots came
[58:58.400 --> 59:03.840]  from a white suv towards a minnesota national guard and minneapolis police team providing
[59:03.840 --> 59:09.600]  neighborhood security in that area the two national guard troops suffered minor injuries
[59:09.600 --> 59:14.960]  one national guard member had to go to a hospital for treatment of lacerations from shattered glass
[59:14.960 --> 59:20.320]  of course the worst of these is maxine waters who got away with promoting violence against
[59:20.320 --> 59:48.800]  those that don't share her views there are those who said that we liked civility when i got up and
[59:48.800 --> 59:53.280]  talked about uh the president's cabinet and i said if you see him anywhere
[59:55.360 --> 1:00:02.560]  you can at a restaurant if you see him in a department store even at a gasoline station
[1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.960]  just tell him you're not welcome here anywhere
[1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:15.920]  and so it frightened a lot of people and of course the lying president said that i had
[1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:21.440]  threatened all of his constituents i did not threaten his constituents his supporters
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:29.600]  i do that all the time but i didn't do it that time now mad maxine has descended upon the
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:37.120]  volatile streets of brooklyn center minnesota in the process violating 18 us code 21 01 that
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:42.960]  states whoever travels in interstate commerce including but not limited to the mail telegraph
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:49.680]  telephone radio or television with intent to incite a riot or to organize promote encourage
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:57.200]  participate in or carry on a riot or to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:03.520]  or carrying on a riot shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years or
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:12.240]  both yes i would like to see the bill in congress pass on police reform but i know that the right wing
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:18.400]  the racist are opposed to it and i don't know what's going to happen to it but i know this we've
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:24.560]  got to stay in the street and we've got to we've got to demand justice we're looking for a guilty
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:31.040]  verdict and we're looking to see if all of the fault that took place and has been taken place
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:38.480]  after they talk what happens to judge florid if nothing does not happen then we know that
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:45.920]  we've got to not only stay in the street but we've got to fight for justice but i am very hopeful
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:54.080]  and i hope that we're going to get uh birdie that they say guilty guilty guilty and if we don't
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:59.760]  we cannot go away and not just manslaughter right i mean oh no not manslaughter no no
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:04.560]  this is this is guilty for murder i don't know whether it's in the first degree but as far as
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:09.840]  i'm concerned it's first degree what should protesters do well we we've got to stay on the
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:16.640]  street uh and we've got to get more active we've got to get more confrontational we've got to make
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:22.720]  sure that they they know that we need business got to make sure that they know we make business
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:28.960]  so here she's demanding the jury convict of the top count and if they don't they're basically
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:33.680]  extorting them that they're going to increase being in the streets increase the level of
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:38.960]  confrontation and this comes in the context in which there have been riots for days attacks on
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:44.720]  police for day attacks on police precincts for days attacks on local people can't even get
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:51.280]  to their own homes in their own neighborhoods for days looting for days arson for day in that
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:56.800]  context she says that confrontation tactics need to get more you cannot hide a grand assault
[1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:04.080]  America is about to have its energy cut off its borders destroyed its dollar brought down to
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:10.720]  nothing all of you that have served satan believe that you are on the right team you're about to
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:19.360]  find out how pathetic you are so i ask all of you who are awake and who love god stop living in fear
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:26.960]  the enemy is about to expose itself the enemy can't help itself the enemy comes to kill
[1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:34.400]  steal destroy we sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it we should but
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:41.200]  once it comes through once it hits us once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:48.000]  we just have to point out we try to stop it so prepare yourselves america you're going under
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  judgment just like all the children that were aborted this is the truth this is the info war
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  war
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  wage war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live on the front lines of the info war
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  man
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:43.120]  well the judge in the chauvin show trial has been praised for criticizing mad maxine waters but
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:48.320]  mad maxine's not mad she's a globalist chai kong chinese communist agent that sold out her black
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:53.760]  community who signed on to the 1990s crime bill that gave black people three times the
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:58.880]  sentence she signed on to plant parenthood being built in black neighborhoods to exterminate them
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:03.040]  plant parenthood now admitted that yesterday plant parenthood ceo
[1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:09.440]  cancels founder margaret sanger over eugenics racism this is a monstrous pig creature
[1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:19.600]  who uses a few bad things that happen as a pretext to burn the country down if the media
[1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:30.720]  says so to give the media all the power and so mad maxine it's always called this violence
[1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:34.240]  boy have you been walked in the capital in the cops late in through the velvet ropes
[1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:38.720]  she wants you in prison for years you're a terrorist but when somebody burns something
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.120]  down well that quomo and seeing an agrees whoever said protesting had to be peaceful
[1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:48.800]  how i played the clip on sunday in a special report i did and we should dig that up
[1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:54.800]  quomo saying we need some white kids to die before the before we do something about the police
[1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:02.160]  and i saw more headlines from cbs news we need white people stand up to the epidemic
[1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:07.120]  of police violence against black people there's some police sometimes discriminating against
[1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:10.560]  black people the police do something wrong black people sure out that goes on sometimes
[1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:15.760]  but statistically they're killing about 14 black men a year in questionable circumstances
[1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:22.640]  it's a red herring it's a distraction from what's going on i'm a big critic of the police
[1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:26.400]  because i don't want to go under globalist control and have all these police state powers
[1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:31.680]  which the left wants all the leftist countries are where they'll beat the living snot out of you
[1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:36.800]  if you don't if you go out after their curfew or you don't wear a mask or you don't move a little
[1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:41.200]  muslin in with you they don't care whether you're black or white they'll break your head in and the
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:46.640]  media is like oh that's a good thing when that happens all that footage of black people being
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:53.280]  beat up in new york not wearing masks and it's like well they deserve it but oh boy if it's a black
[1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:57.360]  guy waving a knife around or shooting a cop and he gets killed well then we got to have the media
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:02.240]  come in make a big deal about it to teach the police the media is in charge and the globalist
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:07.280]  and george soros who's got most of the da's and most accounting attorneys and and and now
[1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:17.120]  over half of the attorney generals one way or another even some republicans are funded by him
[1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:23.440]  i mean they have taken over ladies and gentlemen the globalist have they got a red diaper doper
[1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:32.640]  baby son of the weatherman as the da in san francisco this is incredibly dangerous and you see that
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:37.280]  judge up there well we don't just listen to a congresswoman you know we don't we don't need a
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:43.760]  mistrial no you just have the jurors people going to their houses the last two days cbs news doxing
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:47.600]  him he got people going to the where one of the witnesses lived two years ago and putting pig blood
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:52.720]  and a severed pig head on this property no you just got the media saying they're gonna burn down
[1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:59.440]  everything if you don't send him to prison this isn't about that cop it's about lawlessness and
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:08.320]  terrorism and this mob this french revolution malice bolshevik revolution october revolution
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:16.720]  takeover that's what this is all about that show them the pig blood it's in one of the
[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:24.480]  videos i sent you guys being a defense witness for chauvin isn't safe at all they got to his house
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:30.240]  where he hadn't lived in two years throw pig blood all over the house in a pig head and they're the
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:34.320]  good guys folks how are they shooting they'll be heroes the media just covered up because they want
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:40.080]  a big mob of violent people black white doesn't matter that the left can't control but again
[1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:47.120]  nancy polosi and her surrogate maxine waters and bill gates and and and all of them are playing
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:53.440]  with fire your bolshevik revolution may have worked in russia it may have worked in china
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:09:00.320]  it's not gonna work here jack unbelievable
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:12.080]  so here's the so-called judge saying they're getting a fair trial while criticizing maxine
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.680]  waters if this isn't a mistrial they'll never be one in the history of the world here it is
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:21.840]  i'm aware that kairz women waters was talking specifically about this trial and about the
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:27.840]  unacceptability of uh anything less than a murder conviction and talk about being confrontational
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:34.240]  but you can submit the press articles about that this goes back to what i've been saying from the
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:39.600]  beginning i wish elected officials would stop talking about this case especially in a manner
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:46.240]  that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function i think if
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:51.920]  they want to give their opinions they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:57.600]  with their oath to the constitution to respect the co-equal branch of government their failure
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:02.400]  to do so i think is abhorrent but i don't think it is prejudiced us with additional
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:07.680]  material that would prejudice history they have been told not to watch the news i trust they are
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:14.240]  following those instructions and that there is not in any way uh a prejudice to defend beyond the
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:18.720]  articles that we're talking specifically about the facts of this case a congresswoman's opinion
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:25.280]  really doesn't matter a whole lot anyway so motion for mistrial is denied
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:31.920]  so the motion to say this this trial is a fraud is denied because it doesn't matter if you've
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:36.880]  got thousands of people blocking roads coming in taking over burning things down shooting
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:41.440]  up police stations and they're gonna get the jurors going to their houses oh no there's
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:46.320]  not a mistrial here at all the the president calling the the family saying i'm praying for you
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:51.200]  that you get justice no no no this isn't a bunch of foreign globalist criminals taking the country
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:55.920]  over distracting off the debt the one man has fallen said one man dies it's a tragedy two thousand
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:03.200]  dies of statistic they're using this as a diversion when we come back i'll show you the video what
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:08.320]  they're doing to folks not wearing masks or leaving their houses and what the real tyranny is as they
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:14.160]  starve tens of millions of the lockdown but here's another clip police drag away man attacked by
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.080]  blm mob and the worst part is take orders from the protesters so he's trying to get to his house
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:22.800]  they call him a white supremacist on the news he doesn't even look white to me
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:26.720]  but imagine if you were in a black neighborhood or the other neighborhood you just pull up get
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:30.000]  to your house there's a bunch of people saying you're not getting your house and and beating on
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.960]  your car i mean i'm sure i'm not gonna do that in a black neighborhood i'll tell you that i mean
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.160]  in a white neighborhood i'd probably get my ass kicked in an hispanic neighborhood i'd probably
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.120]  get my ass kicked but let me tell you in a black neighborhood i'd get killed real fast i don't care
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:47.040]  how it's black or white you try to pull up your house 50 people are blocking you you're gonna get
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:51.680]  your ass kicked or dead but that's okay because this is a white neighborhood they think so they
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:56.880]  deserve it they're bad people you that's where the bad people live i mean after all maxi water said
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:14.720]  so these are racist idiots here it is by the way pause it's white virtues singlers with black people
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:23.840]  on motorcycles a motorcycle gang stops your car bows up i mean i'm sorry i've got a baseball bat
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:28.160]  out go crazy i mean that's why that's what the left wants they're pushing everybody i don't
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:31.920]  if the white people were blocking me with motorcycles they're gonna get their ass beat if
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:35.680]  it's black people they're gonna get their ass beat or i'm gonna try i mean think about this
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:48.640]  but it started over we'll come back with the rest of it started over this is gang thuggery
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:55.840]  and this stuff doesn't fly in texas places
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:13:06.800]  so
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:16.480]  look at these weirdo white people now the cops getting anybody you don't go to your house
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:20.320]  you don't go to your family you're going to jail you're the bad man the police are
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:26.080]  bound to sorrows and all the money in the media and that's how america falls and they control the police
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:29.760]  it's over we got a full civil war and the police don't really have something to worry about oh you
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:33.920]  big tough guys they don't hire tough guys anymore because tough guys wouldn't put up with that they
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:40.880]  hire social workers they hire liberals they're like yeah we hate the police we want to kill
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:47.920]  the police hey police arrest that white devil yes sir so another big fat ass communist woman
[1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:56.320]  black lives matter stands for black lavish mansions epic is one of only a handful of domain
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:02.960]  registers that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:07.920]  buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized
[1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:12.960]  crime racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:17.440]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.800]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:29.680]  com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price and 25 percent of your sign
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:34.800]  up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war and then we get five percent as
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:40.080]  well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:44.800]  build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:53.120]  was free so info wars domains com the revolution starts there info wars domains com take action now
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:57.520]  again i don't like to lecture people i'm a very private person but because of the globalists
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:02.640]  they're attacking humanity i've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:07.760]  the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of god and i know some of our listeners
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:11.680]  get mad when i talk about god all day but just give me a break the stateness of the open i've
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:16.480]  always been a christian but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:20.560]  and i get it a lot of you've been turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the
[1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:26.960]  corrupt priest class system and i get it me too believe me i'm one of them but it's that relationship
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:34.320]  with god and just god's universe that god created that is so essential and and god created the universe
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:38.640]  for us to have communion with god through and to have life and so that's what info wars is really

[1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:40.000]  welcome back to alex jones show we're witnessing the big corporate media far and owned in almost
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:46.240]  every case backing death camps in china the exploitation all the world the worst behavior
[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:51.600]  saying white people are inherently evil at universities and the culture and the media
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:55.360]  and i see some of the comments on info wars and band i video with some minority comments but
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:00.000]  you're welcome your comments you're like jones you're going too easy on black people you know
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:06.240]  they're racist and attacking us you see that mind control that doesn't mean a group of white people
[1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:11.200]  black people polka dotted people attack me or mess with me i'm going to defend myself and i'm not
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:17.920]  going to be guilty about it but i know the master plan to play us off against each other it's all
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:22.000]  admitted we have the documents this is all planned to bring the damn country down and wreck the ship
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:26.720]  this is the plan to break the country up and loot the hell out of everybody and then we're
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:31.760]  going to be living in hell and they're going to use divide and conquer to control us just like the
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:38.800]  british empire did in other countries and if you watch this video i'm not lionizing all black people
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:42.960]  i know it's 10 to 1 black on white crime i know the media set it up that way i know the culture
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:49.120]  did that it's sad it's bad but in all these blm events it's like 20 30 white people and three
[1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:53.600]  or four black people who they have at the front of the line who they admit they use at the front
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:59.360]  of the line and then the black controllers train as marches even say white allies in the back
[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:03.680]  because they don't want them seen they want it to look like it's blacks doing it to scapegoat
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:08.960]  the blacks while they start the race war so i'm smart enough to play chess while their folks are
[1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:14.160]  playing checkers but i see the comment oh you're defending what i'm defending i'm watching what's
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:20.320]  going on i'm not defending any of it this is a setup ladies and gentlemen just like antifa was
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:24.320]  there to set up the patriots to go to the capital but there were some patriots went along with it
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:29.200]  i'm not against the patriots either but we need to be smart i'm not against the black people
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:37.600]  but you need to be smart and by the way you have the mothers of people killed
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:45.600]  the black lives matter uses to raise 10.6 billion dollars
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.480]  black lesbian
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:58.880]  and marxist is one acronym i've heard and again they say we don't want a nuclear family
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:03.040]  we want black men to become women that's not your friend that's black lesbian marxist
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:06.720]  but the acronym i've come up with is
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.600]  what is it what did i say buying lavish mansions that's right
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:21.520]  and and and when it came out the few didn't have one or two or four or six or eight mansions in
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:28.960]  airfields and hundreds of millions of dollars and the mother of riana taylor who they've launched
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:35.840]  this whole movement on said i've never gotten help i've never had anybody come to me black lives
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:44.000]  matters a joke she doesn't have a voice facebook bans her she said i've never personally dealt
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:53.520]  with a blml and personally have found them to be a fraud i could walk in a room full of people who
[1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:59.600]  claim to be here for brianus family who don't even know who i am i've watched y'all raise money on
[1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:09.280]  the half of brianus family who has never done a damn thing for us nor have they needed it or asked
[1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:16.160]  so talk about fraud it's amazing how many people have lost focus the
[1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:19.600]  the mother
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:26.400]  of brianna taylor doesn't even have a voice on facebook because she's a white supremacist according
[1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:32.480]  to them they're all the little liberal chicken neck technocrats they control reality and they
[1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:38.560]  decide you don't have a voice because they're raising billions of dollars off her dead daughter's name
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:43.840]  and a questionable police shooting one that's actually questionable that rand paul passed the
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:48.960]  law to deal with so he gets beat up with the police for doing it say her name say her name
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:54.000]  well the head of black lives matter makes hundreds of millions of dollars herself dressing up in
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:07.520]  devil outfits what a sick joke and now she's threatened to sue black people that criticize her
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:14.400]  when she literally does rituals dressed up like a demon out of hell and everyone worships her this
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:22.400]  is a sick joke this is meant to destroy the community no matter what color you are that's
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:26.480]  who these delusional freakazoid's are and they have the media's control they're all a bunch of

[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:24.240]  just like they didn't rush it they first got the police to bow down to Moscow
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:29.360]  and they fell off and it took them 15 years in control and once they did they killed every damn

[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:51.440]  up absolutely incredible biden invokes vaccine waters i'm praying show on verdict is the right
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:57.520]  verdict so they can burn down the cities and again distract from their tricom service i mean
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:03.360]  this is the country in deep deep deep trouble so pray for a global awakening we're gonna
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:06.800]  we're gonna open the phones up to get your take on when do you think the verdict is going to be
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:11.840]  what is the verdict is going to be and the response of burning cities well this is just
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:18.560]  this people getting shot people getting killed random hordes of marxist black white hispanic
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:23.680]  you name it marching into neighborhoods that are middle class and attacking people shooting
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:28.480]  people in the head the media is like well remember back when they were trying to get a race worker
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:32.640]  one five six years ago under obama and they were shooting up all the police stations in
[1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:38.720]  Louisiana and texas and california and like five cops here six cops there you dead cops everywhere
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:43.600]  and shenanians like qualmo and others are like well i mean you better reform yourself that's
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:47.520]  what happens when you're mad you know if a cop does something a thousand miles away that might
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:51.760]  be questionable well you just pull up to a group of cops and you just shoot them
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:30:00.480]  and where would they do it at black lives matter rallies they would do it at at anti police rallies
[1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:09.680]  trayvon martin rallies and you just shoot a bunch of cops and the shooters were so dumb a lot of
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:14.160]  times they'd shoot black cops too and the media be like well you know the black cops are bad too
[1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:26.160]  totally mindless idiocy the breakdown of civilization truly dangerous truly out of
[1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:32.080]  control i'm gonna go to your phone calls we have a new big sale that we've just launched and this
[1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:37.360]  also funds our operation plus these are amazing products alpha power is the dry version of super
[1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:42.800]  mill vitality it's way stronger than real vitality it doesn't compete with it i can take super mill
[1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:46.880]  sometimes i can't even take alpha power some people like super mill better than alpha power alpha
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:52.480]  power is technically stronger but it's a dry herb not cold pressed because the super mills like
[1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:57.600]  living it takes four or five times your herbs to make it but technically there's less herb in it
[1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:01.440]  and key compounds than in the alpha power
[1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:09.200]  it's a best seller it's been sold out for quite a while it's 40 off an info or store.com women

[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:48.160]  eight different ingredients but moderate dosage this is basically the same just four times stronger
[1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:55.200]  I mean here's an example I mean rocket rest has four times melatonin of of our other product
[1:31:56.240 --> 1:31:59.920]  and I'm not again it's just for what you want it's like some people want beer somewhat whiskey

[1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:09.840]  magnum some people want a 22 long rifle I mean it's what you're looking for amazing dreams though
[1:32:09.840 --> 1:32:14.960]  on rocket rest amazing dreams on knockout but the truth is haven't even taken a knockout for five

[1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:37.280]  let's talk to kathleen in canada thank you you're on the air hi alex how are you doing today
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:41.200]  i'm just watching them play us like a fiddle what do you think how you doing oh i
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:46.640]  just say my thing okay so number one on the verdict i think it's going to be a hung jury
[1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:51.840]  i think a lot of people got scared about the maxine waters comments even the defense lawyer
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:57.040]  brought it up that his phone was blowing up on the trial and i that's what i think i think
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:00.000]  they're going to be a hung jury and it's going to be a they're going to retry him i think they're
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:05.760]  going to try to keep going all year that's my yeah i think that seems totally controlled
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:10.960]  she's a demon i think they told her to go do that to hang the jury i agree to cause the blow-up
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:13.840]  because they're all you know the justice department's tapping the phones the jurors are
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:17.520]  totally corrupt the justice department turned out ran the whole trail on martin response
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:21.600]  and i think they sent her in to get a hung jury i agree with you so they can have a bigger blow-up
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:26.960]  yes and i think that's what's going to happen i'm i just want to bring up a quick thing um i
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:31.520]  just want to know did you see that umar segment where he pretty much told his audience that
[1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:36.560]  the liberal media's been lying about uh covid the whole time i just want to know your thoughts on
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:40.800]  the bill march segment because i haven't heard to talk about that yet well i think bill march is
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:44.640]  very talented very watchable i don't agree with a lot of what he says but i i mean i think he got
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:50.080]  smart yeah he said covid's basically a giant hoax uh and a fraud oh and i forgot to hit that
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:55.440]  now major study says the mass do not protect you from viruses and give you bacterial pneumonia
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:35:01.760]  and are killing people and causing brain damage and mass but the left loves it though yeah well
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:06.240]  bill mar is even telling he's actually starting to agree with uh the rest of us explaining that
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:10.720]  the liberal media is just lying to keep everybody controlled well i agree i actually shot a video
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.640]  saturday that it's got about 300 000 views or maybe 500 000 views because we pulled the bill
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.880]  mar on banned on video folks and i said hey i've always admired bill mar i thought it was funny
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:24.400]  i'm politically incorrect i think he's a great talk show host i disagree with a lot of the sick
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:30.000]  things he says but he's obviously very entertaining he's obviously very smart and he said i shouldn't
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.680]  be censored he said i'll show he should not be censored he should not be sued for what he says
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:38.480]  he has the right to say it we have a right to counter him and that he stood up for me my god
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:42.720]  even when i've attacked him and said horrible things about him uh and the other is 570 000
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:47.360]  views must see watch bill mar comes out against covid 19 hoax and he just devastates it as a
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:53.200]  basically a fraud yeah exactly um i just think i think he's like pretty much he's not going to
[1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:57.440]  become like a regular democrat on the left he's going to have to come out as a libertarian
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:01.600]  or they're going to start calling him a fraud oh actually they've been demonizing him before this
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:07.280]  saying stop burning down random neighborhood stop shooting random police that's what bad guys do
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:14.320]  yeah no he he's he look the word is he's more like tucker carlson he's just he just he won't
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:18.800]  be on air if he doesn't tell the line so he has to make some false statement and make a true statement
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:22.800]  uh but i'm i'm rooting for bill mar to go all the way thank you so much all right we're going to go
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:28.960]  to break let's cram into one more in a minute and a half we have uh let's talk to carlos in texas go
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:39.120]  ahead carlos alec love the show love all the products i'm a firm believer uh and the true
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.800]  patriot in the m4 i love you alec i'm going to love you too brother what do you think is going to go
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:49.040]  down with this crazy thing well the the uh shawvin trial much like the lady that just uh
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:52.880]  pulls on foam is captain for candidate it's probably is going to be hung because they are
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:37:01.120]  intimidating the people but then again the these damn cops that that are aren't protecting the
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:06.480]  the populace let alone they're not going to protect the jurors that that are that are part of the
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:12.720]  case but i'm wondering you know a lot of these types of cases happen all over the place but you
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:18.560]  know this is one of the most controversial ones how come crap like this does not happen in places
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:24.960]  like texas you know in houston or or or in it or even everywhere else you know because there was
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:30.000]  some damage in downtown houston whenever they had their their little march or their carlos don't hang
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.520]  up i want to get you sound like a really smart question i want to get the whole question in and
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:40.000]  try to answer it as best i can they choose liberal cities to do this to exercise their power to burn
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.400]  things down and as liberals you think austin or houston is it's not they want it in the city
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:54.240]  they totally control being example the rest of country the world is awakening the world
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.880]  is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm they are discovering the globalist
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:04.960]  the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral commission the bill deberg group the bohemian grove
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:12.880]  the club of rome and so even though it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:18.320]  they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:24.000]  forced them out in the open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:30.480]  happen realize humanity is winning you've got to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:38.000]  god's justice that is invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:43.120]  trust in god to lead god and direct your soul and then take action against the globalist and realize
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:48.240]  you've got my commitment from alex jones and my crew to you we will never back down from the
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:55.360]  globalist and we will never surrender as negative as times are right now and as depressing as things
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:02.000]  can be you have to understand that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:10.560]  is a reckoning it's god giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:15.200]  decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:20.160]  down to that so as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:26.480]  as well and realize that god is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having our
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:34.400]  own will god is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:39.840]  look at mainstream media in hollywood this whole evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:44.880]  and the mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:49.360]  you're ugly you're in the bad because satan hates you because you're made in the image of god the
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:55.200]  creator of the universe the globalists are purposely collapsing our world they are creating

[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:23.840]  yeah i grew up in alex the 1980s and early 90s and if you blocked off somebody's neighborhood i
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:28.800]  don't care it was a neighborhood of black white polka dotted people you're gonna get your ass kicked
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:34.560]  but now the police in places like minnesota when they block up a neighborhood
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:38.560]  bunch of weird-ass white people on their motorcycles with one black dude they're parade and around
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:42.400]  like he's there get out of jail free card some guys that are going home my family
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:48.560]  he gets in their face they start roughing him up he goes to jail and then the black lives matter
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:55.280]  white people with the one token black guy they've got say good job police now you do what we say
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:59.200]  exactly you don't want to get rid of the police you want them to let you go around act like a
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:05.840]  bunch of dirty criminals that's called bolshevism ladies and gentlemen but we've got resistance
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:10.800]  forming you know i kept telling you they would get select groups of marines and army
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:15.200]  that they'd already pre questioned and say oh we got 49 percent took the shot
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:20.480]  but i went and looked at the real force structure numbers made some calls they said no
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:27.520]  75 percent of the marines are refusing about 70 percent of the army and sure enough it's in the
[1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:35.040]  news now that the vast majority are refusing texas is like 15 quote vaccinated oh i thought it was
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:40.320]  half the country i thought we all wanted it we all lined up around the block only people susceptible
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:46.160]  to bull now they admit the vaccine doesn't protect you now they admit you gotta get 10 of them a year
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:54.080]  now they say gotta keep wearing the mask forever the original articles were 39 49 percent of
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:59.040]  marines refusing no that was in the select groups you already questioned and when the rubber
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:06.480]  met the road they said no so the new video needs to go viral by adan salazar article
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:13.760]  on info wars dot com military members say half no we won't take the vaccine so we we bleep this
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:17.600]  and uh here it is so did you get the vaccine
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:26.000]  no hey did you get the vaccine
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:30.560]  did you get the vaccine what did you get the vaccine
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:38.160]  did you get the vaccine no did you get the vaccine no they don't get the vaccine
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:45.360]  did y'all get the vaccine no hey did you get the vaccine
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:46.360]  No.
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:47.360]  Did you get the vaccine?
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:48.360]  No.
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  Did you get the vaccine?
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:50.360]  No.
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:51.360]  Did you get the vaccine?
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:52.360]  No.
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:53.360]  No.
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:54.360]  Did you get the vaccine?
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:55.360]  No.
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:56.360]  No.
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:44:57.360]  No.
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:44:58.360]  I don't want to die.
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:00.360]  If no, I don't want to die.
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:02.360]  Burn in hell, Bill Gates.
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:03.360]  Burn in hell, you little bastard.
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:05.360]  You're not going to get what you want.
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:07.360]  Humanity is waking up.
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:09.360]  Humanity is rising.
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:11.360]  So they built their attack up for decades, prepared it.
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:12.360]  They launched it.
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:14.360]  It looks like we're losing, but we're not.
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:16.360]  Their huge assault is failing.
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:19.360]  I want to warn you, though, they got other tricks up their sleeves.
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:20.360]  So this will not be easy.
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:21.360]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:22.360]  They're coming to kill everybody.
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:23.360]  So you might as well say no.
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:24.360]  You might as well fight.
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:28.360]  I'm not going to lie to you about the future, though.
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  We got a big battle ahead of us.
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:33.360]  You can figure it out now, or you can figure it out later.
[1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:35.360]  And I know this audience figured it out, and I love you.
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:36.360]  You're awesome.
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:37.360]  But I'm talking to everybody that tunes in.
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:38.360]  Well, what's the show all about?
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:39.360]  What's this guy saying?
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:40.360]  Well, now you know what I'm saying.
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:43.360]  Not the edited clips, not the stuff out of context.
[1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:46.360]  Like, goofy once a week or something, the real damn deal.
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.360]  They're real people in this world.
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:49.360]  There's real warnings.
[1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:51.360]  There's truth in this world, not just lies.
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:54.360]  And it's right here.
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:57.360]  I'll tell the truth, or I'll die trying.
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:45:59.360]  So Carlos, boiling it down, what are you getting at?
[1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:02.360]  Because you're bringing up some good points about liberal cities.
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:04.360]  Why are they attacking in liberal cities?
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:06.360]  They're doing it because they control them there,
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:09.360]  and the police will stand down and let the riots get bigger
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:11.360]  to then scare all the rest of the cities.
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  That make sense?
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:13.360]  Yes, sir.
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:15.360]  It makes perfect sense.
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  But then there's also the component you were just talking about,
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.360]  people not getting vaccinated.
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:26.360]  So I have people that work together with the community
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:28.360]  and the city of Houston.
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:30.360]  And I don't want to go into too much detail,
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:32.360]  but they're not being pressured.
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  But every week they have conference calls trying
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:41.360]  to get these community leaders and churches to be COVID centers
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:43.360]  to inoculate people.
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  There's a lot of churches.
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:46.360]  You're talking about gymnasiums, everything, yeah.
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:49.360]  Yes, churches specifically.
[1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:53.360]  Of course, you know, churches have lots of ability to...
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:55.360]  Well, yeah, they're going to tell you it's the religion.
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:57.360]  We don't take communion now.
[1:46:57.360 --> 1:46:59.360]  We take a shot from Bill Gates.
[1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:00.360]  Correct.
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:04.360]  And the people that I know are completely against it.
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.360]  They don't want to be experimented on.
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:09.360]  And if they don't want to get it done to them,
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:11.360]  they don't want to have to do it to other people.
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:13.360]  But every single week, right now it's optional.
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:17.360]  And they're asking the people that are part of...
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:18.360]  You've got to say no.
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  You've got to say no, hell no.
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:23.360]  And then start Tuskegee in the history
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:25.360]  of secret experimentation meetings.
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:27.360]  Start organizing meetings at your churches about this
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:29.360]  and explain to your pastors,
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:32.360]  it doesn't go away until they get on the attack.
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:37.360]  They need to stop just fighting this by accepting it,
[1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:39.360]  but saying no.
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:42.360]  You've got to go on offense because this is not a vaccine.
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:46.360]  This is a mRNA system that top scientists say
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:47.360]  is going to destroy our genetics.
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:49.360]  Thank you, Carlos.
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:54.360]  Yeah, I've...
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  Here's the problem.
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:58.360]  A lot of people go into media
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:01.360]  because they just want to be famous to make money.
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  And a lot of people are too ugly to be in TV
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:04.360]  so they're in radio.
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  And that's the famous saying.
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  And a lot of folks get into Hollywood
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  so they get into whatever.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:12.360]  And most people that are preachers,
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:14.360]  I mean real preachers are out missionaries in Africa
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:16.360]  and Latin America and Asia
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:17.360]  or they're out helping homeless.
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:20.360]  I know a lot of real Christians.
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  But they're out at soup kitchens
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:23.360]  and they're doing things like that
[1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  or like Ron Paul's a Christian.
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:26.360]  He would give away until he retired
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.360]  a third of his medical practice.
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:29.360]  It was free.
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  My dad's third of his practice was free until he retired
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:32.360]  because he was a real Christian.
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:34.360]  You're supposed to do that.
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:38.360]  Being a Christian means you're a servant.
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:41.360]  It also means you serve God before man.
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:43.360]  But I go to most of these big mega churches.
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  I've been invited to them.
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:45.360]  I've been to them.
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:46.360]  And man, it's a bunch of feel good.
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:47.360]  Everything's fine.
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  Crap.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:49.360]  Now scan your QR code to get in
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:51.360]  and make sure you don't have COVID.
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  They're going to tell you to take the market to beast folks.
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:54.360]  They're not churches.
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:49:00.360]  They are feel good clubs.
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:01.360]  And I'm not going to judge them
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:04.360]  because I got a stick in my eye too.
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:05.360]  But I'll tell you this.
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:10.360]  I don't feel the spirit of God in those places.
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:11.360]  And that's a sad thing.
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  I feel a bunch of people that are hedging their bets
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:15.360]  on eternity.
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  They're not sure God's real.
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:19.360]  So they go to a church.
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:20.360]  God's real.
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:21.360]  I gave God.
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:23.360]  It's kind of like playing craps
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  where a lot of people will bet
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:26.360]  where they put on a bunch of numbers.
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:27.360]  I'm not sure what number's going to win,
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.360]  but I'm just going to put a bunch.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:31.360]  Hillary told Larry Nichols.
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:33.360]  She said, I don't know if God's Satan's real,
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  but I go to devil worship and I go to church.
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  That's how soulless she was.
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:40.360]  She literally would go do all this occult except
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360]  but also go to church and pray to Jesus.
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  That's how cut off she was thinking it was like
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  she was hedging her bets.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  There ain't no hedging your bets with this, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:50.360]  You're all in.
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.360]  If you knew the Holy Spirit, you'd know that.
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  Or if you read the Bible, you'd know that.
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:55.360]  You were hot nor cold.
[1:49:55.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:58.360]  God respects the Satanist.
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:02.360]  At least they joined Lucifer.
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:06.360]  You people playing games and pretending
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:07.360]  that you can hedge your bets.
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:09.360]  There's no hedging your bets on eternity.
[1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:15.360]  So you better put your money on the square.
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:21.360]  You better put it on the number and you better bet it all.
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:23.360]  That's all it comes down to.
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:25.360]  There's no hedging bets.
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:27.360]  There's no hedging bets.
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:28.360]  All right.
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:29.360]  Who's up next year?
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:30.360]  Who's been home the longest?
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  Let's go to Hazy in Colorado.
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:33.360]  You're on the air.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:34.360]  Welcome.
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:35.360]  How's it going, Alex?
[1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  Good, brother.
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:40.360]  Hey, so about this trial, it just seems like
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:42.360]  the perfect storm is upon us.
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  And by the perfect storm, I mean their perfect storm.
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:49.360]  So I think we all know that everybody in this world
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:51.360]  has bought and paid for.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  Whether it be your boss paying your, you know,
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.360]  giving you your check so you could pay rent.
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:57.360]  Sure.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:59.360]  Bob Dylan says that you got to serve somebody.
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:00.360]  Yeah.
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:01.360]  So you're always going to serve somebody,
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:03.360]  whether it be good or bad, you know,
[1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:05.360]  working for your boss is good.
[1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:07.360]  But then bosses change.
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:09.360]  It goes from good to evil.
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:12.360]  So when you're working for an evil boss,
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:14.360]  you're going to follow what they say.
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:17.360]  Now we all know that jurors, they're picked, right?
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:19.360]  They don't just land.
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:22.360]  So picked is the same thing as placed,
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.360]  which means they could have placed the correct jury
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:27.360]  in there or jurors.
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:28.360]  Yeah.
[1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:33.360]  So the maximum output would happen,
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:35.360]  which is burning down cities and, I mean,
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:37.360]  nearly every city.
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:42.360]  And that takes it to the level of unoperable cities.
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:44.360]  That means, you know, stores aren't going to be open.
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:46.360]  They're going to be all burned down.
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  I mean, how long would it take?
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:48.360]  Oh, that's the plan.
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:49.360]  They want the social contract broke.
[1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:51.360]  Cloward and Peb in the fall of America.
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:52.360]  Yeah.
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:55.360]  How long would it take for us to rebuild?
[1:51:55.360 --> 1:51:56.360]  I agree.
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:59.360]  They wouldn't place a jury to find him guilty.
[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:02.360]  They'd place him to find him non-guilty to make sure it happens.
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:03.360]  Exactly.
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:05.360]  That's what I'm trying to get to,
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:09.360]  is that it seems like all this false stuff that's in the news,
[1:52:09.360 --> 1:52:11.360]  you know, the way that they're like building it up
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:13.360]  and then you get Mad Maxine,
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:15.360]  that's like building it up like a crescendo.
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:17.360]  You know, it's like we're just peeking.
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:18.360]  Hold on.
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  Don't hang up.
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  I'll get to Burger and everybody else that's holding here,
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:23.360]  Anthony and others.
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:24.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:26.360]  And then we've got Robert Barnes popping in.
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:28.360]  We've got constitutional lawyer Norm Pattis,
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:30.360]  both top lawyers in the country,
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:32.360]  joining us to give their take on this.
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:33.360]  By the way, they're both liberals,
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:35.360]  but now they're obviously more nationalists
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:36.360]  because they see the takeover.
[1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:38.360]  And then they say there's trials in total.
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:43.360]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:46.360]  with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:43.360]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:45.360]  Go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:16.360]  We are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:20.360]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:23.360]  and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:26.360]  of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:28.360]  And then shall many be offended
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:31.360]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:33.360]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:36.360]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:39.360]  no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it,
[1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  and God created this country.
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:49.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:55.360]  We're now into hour number three,
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:58.360]  Constitutional Lawyer Norm Pattis joins us.
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  Just about six minutes and we'll back your calls.
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:03.360]  Hazy, you're making some great points about...
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.360]  This is a big move.
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:07.360]  This has been geared up for a long time,
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:09.360]  just the way Matthew Waters is pushing it.
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:13.360]  They want war, they want burning cities to distract away
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.360]  from what Joe Biden's been doing.
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:18.360]  How do we stop this? How do we peacefully somehow fix this?
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:22.360]  Well, that's the point, is I don't think there's any way
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:27.360]  that we can peacefully fix this because you can't be peaceful.
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  I'm not saying to start anything, but I'm saying...
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:31.360]  No, but I mean, somebody comes trying to hurt me.
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:33.360]  I don't care what color they are. They're going to die.
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:36.360]  The point being is, is that there is no peaceful way to do it.
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.360]  That's why it's the perfect storm. They know it.
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:41.360]  They've set it up that way to where we can't defend ourselves
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.360]  in any direction.
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:49.360]  And my whole point here is, if he is found guilty,
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:52.360]  then that means that, you know, in my mind
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:54.360]  that the jury wasn't paid off.
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  And then we have to worry about the next storm.
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:55:59.360]  So we're going to figure out a lot.
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  This is like a breaking point, in my opinion,
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:04.360]  of what's really going on,
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:07.360]  and how much theater is actually happening right now
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:09.360]  and how many people are actually paid off.
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:11.360]  I agree with you. Well, what do you think?
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:13.360]  Do you think the officer deserves the charge?
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:15.360]  I think the charge is way over what it could be.
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:17.360]  Maybe manslaughter. I think it's too intense.
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:20.360]  There's no way that he did this intentionally.
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:24.360]  I mean, in my opinion, you know, I've had good experiences
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  with cops, even though they've written me tickets.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.360]  Why would you kill somebody in front of 30 people
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:29.360]  knowing you're going to prison?
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:31.360]  Even if he was a psycho, he wouldn't do it, exactly.
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  Yeah, so it just, it boils down to,
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.360]  we're right on the breaking point.
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:38.360]  We're going to learn a lot about this,
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:40.360]  but that doesn't make me feel any better.
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:42.360]  Like, as in, safer.
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:44.360]  You know, I live out in the mountains,
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:47.360]  so I'm not worried about things burning down here.
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  But you're in the right place, brother.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:53.360]  How are we going to, like I said,
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:55.360]  are we going to build back if cities burn,
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:57.360]  or are they going to leave that way?
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:59.360]  No, that's the plan. It's bankrupt the country.
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:02.360]  All right, Anthony in Florida, then Bob,
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:04.360]  and then we got our special guest.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:06.360]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:08.360]  Hey, what's up, Alex? How are you doing?
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:10.360]  Good, sir. I'm watching the global's takeover.
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:12.360]  What's your view on this?
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.360]  Man, I'm just tired of these chumps, man.
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:17.360]  I mean, I see the whole thing, they're rolling out with vaccine,
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:19.360]  and it's just like, you know, it's like in their deck of cards,
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:22.360]  you know, it's just like, they tried the vaccine thing,
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:23.360]  that guy fired on them.
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:25.360]  I mean, most of the social media is awake.
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:27.360]  It's insane, man. I've been listening to 11 years.
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:29.360]  I see people now, man.
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:31.360]  I just see the liberty in them rising up,
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:34.360]  and you know, everybody's just seeing the fraud.
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.360]  That's what I see as people waking up,
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:39.360]  as negative as things are politically at the top.
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:42.360]  I see the whole bottom waking up. Is that what you're seeing?
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:45.360]  Yeah, man, I've never seen this, and I've been,
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:47.360]  before it was popular to, you know,
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:49.360]  love freedom and everything.
[1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:52.360]  You know, I see people, just a lot of people are seeing this vaccine.
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:55.360]  They know this thing's BS, man, and the globalists are chomping.
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:57.360]  Well, that's because you're in Florida.
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:57:59.360]  I spent a lot of time this year in Florida,
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:02.360]  and man, it's the most awake place I've seen, brother.
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:04.360]  What's going on in Florida?
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:06.360]  Man, I just hope for the best, man,
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:09.360]  because I'm not taking the vaccine passports and all that.
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:12.360]  Luckily, the census doesn't want to do that, you know,
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:15.360]  but luckily, man, I'm in Florida where people are waking up
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:18.360]  and we're seeing, like, real liberty come here,
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:20.360]  and I definitely wanted to stay like that, man.
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:22.360]  I don't want this thing to turn into New York
[1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:24.360]  or any of these, you know, Democrat-controlled cities
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:29.360]  where they just go, and the worst has just begun, you know?
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:31.360]  I mean, all their cities are hellholes.
[1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:33.360]  I mean, New York used to be nice.
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:35.360]  LA used to be nice.
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:36.360]  San Francisco used to be nice.
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:38.360]  Seattle used to be nice.
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:40.360]  Now they're run into the ground.
[1:58:40.360 --> 1:58:41.360]  God bless you.
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:45.360]  All right, I'm going to get to Burger
[1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:47.360]  and everybody else that's holding,
[1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:51.360]  but I've got, and Rob and others of that order, and Justin.
[1:58:51.360 --> 1:58:54.360]  The Norm Patas is a top criminal lawyer, constitutional lawyer,
[1:58:54.360 --> 1:58:56.360]  a free speech lawyer.
[1:58:56.360 --> 1:58:58.360]  He's my lawyer in a lot of cases,
[1:58:58.360 --> 1:59:01.360]  but he's coming on separately about this case
[1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:03.360]  and the time bomb we're watching,
[1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:05.360]  and what happens when a judge says,
[1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:07.360]  well, what Maxine Waters did was despicable and terrible
[1:59:07.360 --> 1:59:10.360]  and abhorrent, but it didn't affect this trial.
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:12.360]  I'm not a lawyer, but, man, they're threatening jurors
[1:59:12.360 --> 1:59:14.360]  at their houses, they're threatening witnesses,
[1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:16.360]  they're pouring pig blood at pigs' heads at their houses,
[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:19.360]  and they're saying, we're going to go crazy if you don't do this.
[1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:22.360]  That puts pressure on people, and the judge goes,
[1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:26.360]  well, I'm sure the jurors aren't watching TV because I told them.
[1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:31.360]  Man, if this isn't a missed trial, then I don't know what is,
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:33.360]  and then is there double jeopardy?
[1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:34.360]  What happens?
[1:59:34.360 --> 1:59:37.360]  We'll talk about it all with Norm Patas in 60 seconds.
[1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:42.360]  infowars.com, newswars.com, fan.video.
[1:59:42.360 --> 1:59:44.360]  When you share those URLs,
[1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:50.360]  Hill Gates gets really, really upset.
[1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:52.360]  The equation is very simple.
[1:59:52.360 --> 1:59:56.360]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma,
[1:59:56.360 --> 2:00:00.360]  they control academia, they control the military,
[2:00:00.360 --> 2:00:03.360]  industrial complex, they control big tech,
[2:00:03.360 --> 2:00:06.360]  and everywhere that they have been in control
[2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:08.360]  in the third world, they have established
[2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:12.360]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:16.360]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom
[2:00:16.360 --> 2:00:19.360]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights
[2:00:19.360 --> 2:00:21.360]  and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:25.360]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic,
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:27.360]  they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down,
[2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:33.360]  and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:35.360]  and the free market that threatens them.
[2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:37.360]  They're monopoly of control.
[2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:38.360]  That's why they target infowars,
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:41.360]  because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:43.360]  But the only way our transmission gets out
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:46.360]  is if you promote infowars and fan.video.
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:01:12.360]  So redouble your efforts. We're all on this together.
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:20.360]  I'm trying to drag me down.
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:25.360]  They say they want to bring me in guilty
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:30.360]  for the killing of my dignity,
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  for the life of my dignity.
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:42.360]  But I say...
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:50.360]  All right, Bob Marley bringing us in.
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:51.360]  I shot the sheriff.
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:52.360]  Same thing.
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  I brought down the globalist with your help,
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:56.360]  but I did not shoot the deputy.
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:57.360]  They always change the subject.
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:01:58.360]  That's how they do it.
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:00.360]  Norm Pattis joins us for two segments.
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.360]  I really appreciate him coming on this busy schedule
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:06.360]  out of Connecticut with the top criminal lawyers in the country.
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:08.360]  A lot of you will recognize it when you see him or the name.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:10.360]  It's one of the biggest cases in the last few decades.
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:12.360]  But just looking at the judge saying,
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.360]  oh, Maxine did something horrible,
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:15.360]  but it's not a mistrial.
[2:02:15.360 --> 2:02:17.360]  Armed gangs blocking neighborhoods,
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:19.360]  shooting up police stations,
[2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:21.360]  burning areas of cities across the country.
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:25.360]  Ahead of this, what in the hell is going on here?
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:27.360]  And if you were God, what would you do?
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:28.360]  What should the judge do?
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:29.360]  What should we do?
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:32.360]  Because this does not look like freedom.
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:33.360]  This looks like mob rule.
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:35.360]  Even if this cop was guilty,
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:37.360]  which I don't think he's guilty to the level they say,
[2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:39.360]  I say he's got to go free
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:42.360]  because better a thousand guilty men go free
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  than one innocent man go to prison.
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:47.360]  This is giving into bullying and terrorism
[2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:49.360]  and saying you put him in prison
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:51.360]  and we're going to burn your city down.
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:53.360]  Well, I said this ain't about that cop now.
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:02:55.360]  It's about you running my life and I'm not doing it.
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:57.360]  I mean, how do you put that into law
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:00.360]  or is my instincts wrong?
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:02.360]  No, your instincts are dead on, Alex.
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:03.360]  These are terrifying times.
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:06.360]  I haven't seen anything like this in my lifetime.
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:09.360]  It reminds me of the passion stoked
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:12.360]  by the Boston massacre trial in 1770
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:15.360]  when John Adams defended British soldiers
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:17.360]  who shot into a crowd at Boston.
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:19.360]  It sort of reminds me of the Salem witchcrafts
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:21.360]  where spectral evidence was relied upon
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:23.360]  to obtain dubious convictions
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:25.360]  about things that couldn't have taken place.
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:27.360]  But here's the bottom line.
[2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:30.360]  I mean, I think we have a legitimation crisis in the country
[2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:34.360]  and right now we still share certain core fundamental values,
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:37.360]  the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial,
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:38.360]  orderly process.
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:41.360]  Those are at stake in Minnesota, in Minneapolis.
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:45.360]  Now, the trial judge yesterday took aim at Maxine Waters,
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.360]  and I was on one of your shows this morning,
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:49.360]  The American Journal,
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:51.360]  urging your viewers to call their congressman
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:54.360]  a demand that Maxine be removed from Congress.
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:56.360]  Only Congress can do that.
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:03:58.360]  You can't impeach a congressman.
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:02.360]  What she did yesterday was a direct assault on American values,
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:04.360]  as though a Russian or Chinese tank
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:06.360]  went cruising down the streets in Manhattan
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:08.360]  and stopped in front of a courtroom and said,
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:10.360]  stop, we don't want to do it the way you've been doing it
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:12.360]  for the last several centuries.
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:14.360]  It's dead wrong.
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:17.360]  Now, here's, I fault George.
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:19.360]  I mean, I don't fault the judge entirely.
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:22.360]  I fault Mr. Chauvin's lawyer in part
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:25.360]  for not pressing the issue hard enough yesterday.
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:28.360]  Maxine Waters' comments were outrageous.
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:31.360]  Now, there's a fiction in the law
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:34.360]  that a properly instructed jury follows the law.
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:36.360]  The judge told him not to watch TV.
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:38.360]  Absent evidence to the contrary,
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.360]  he's going to assume that they followed that instruction.
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:42.360]  But let's use common sense.
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.360]  You're a juror in Minneapolis.
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:46.360]  You've just heard the case,
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:49.360]  and you hear of another shooting that sounds similar.
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:51.360]  There's unrest in the streets,
[2:04:51.360 --> 2:04:53.360]  and a congressman comes to town
[2:04:53.360 --> 2:04:55.360]  while there's smoke wafting in the air
[2:04:55.360 --> 2:04:57.360]  and storefronts being boarded up
[2:04:57.360 --> 2:04:59.360]  in portions of the courthouse.
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:03.360]  And there's issues of demand saying you better rule this way.
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:04.360]  It's awful.
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:07.360]  It is unprecedented in American society
[2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:10.360]  for a sitting elected official to travel,
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:12.360]  not even to her own district.
[2:05:12.360 --> 2:05:14.360]  A powerful firebrand,
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:17.360]  second only to the Speaker of the House.
[2:05:17.360 --> 2:05:20.360]  But I think that what Chauvin's lawyer should have done,
[2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:22.360]  and he didn't do it, and I don't know why,
[2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:26.360]  is ask the judge to war-deer, to question jurors.
[2:05:26.360 --> 2:05:28.360]  They should have brought each juror individually
[2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:30.360]  into the judge's chambers and said,
[2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:32.360]  have you been following news in town?
[2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:34.360]  Are you concerned for your safety?
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:36.360]  Do you still think that you can be fair and impartial?
[2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:39.360]  The absence of that piece of information
[2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:42.360]  could be fatal to a claim for a mistrial.
[2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:45.360]  Because the standard is not a perfect trial,
[2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:47.360]  but a fair and impartial jury.
[2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:49.360]  The judge has given adequate instructions to the jurors
[2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:51.360]  to keep them from following the news
[2:05:51.360 --> 2:05:54.360]  if the jurors are following it.
[2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:57.360]  I think that Chauvin's lawyer
[2:05:57.360 --> 2:05:58.360]  should have said to the judge,
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:00.360]  I want to war-deer these jurors.
[2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:01.360]  This is extraordinary.
[2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:03.360]  This is the most amazing trial
[2:06:03.360 --> 2:06:05.360]  that we've had, maybe, in this country
[2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:08.360]  since the Sam Shepard case in 1954.
[2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:10.360]  That was the fugitive case.
[2:06:10.360 --> 2:06:12.360]  And in that case, 12 years later,
[2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:15.360]  the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the conviction on the grounds
[2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:17.360]  that the trial was conducted in a, quote,
[2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:19.360]  carnival-like, end quote, atmosphere.
[2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:22.360]  What made it carnival-like were two things.
[2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:24.360]  Mr. Shepard was a neurosurgeon.
[2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:26.360]  He was alleged to have killed his wife.
[2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:28.360]  He blew up the media worldwide.
[2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:30.360]  And in Cleveland, inside the courtroom,
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:32.360]  the press basically took over.
[2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:34.360]  And the Supreme Court was very critical
[2:06:34.360 --> 2:06:36.360]  of the trial judge for permitting that.
[2:06:36.360 --> 2:06:38.360]  Judges don't do that anymore.
[2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:40.360]  But what remained and what is constant
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:43.360]  with the Chauvin trial is the circus-like atmosphere
[2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:45.360]  outside the courthouse.
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:47.360]  And you've got Maxine Water coming in
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:49.360]  and commanding one of the circles.
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:52.360]  I mean, since I appeared on your show this morning,
[2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:54.360]  American Journal, George Bush is apparently,
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:56.360]  or not George Bush, excuse me,
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:06:59.360]  Joe Biden has apparently now gotten into the action.
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:02.360]  He has called the Floyd family to express his hope
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:04.360]  that this case turns out the right way.
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:06.360]  What does that mean?
[2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:09.360]  We have a juror, jury that has been selected
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:11.360]  from a fair cross-section of the community,
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:13.360]  questioned, they've heard the evidence,
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:15.360]  and we are awaiting their decision.
[2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:18.360]  The right outcome is the outcome that they reach.
[2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:20.360]  They are the fact-finders here.
[2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:23.360]  This case should be mis-tried
[2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:25.360]  and ultimately probably will.
[2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:27.360]  But it's going to take what's called
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:29.360]  the habeas corpus proceeding
[2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:31.360]  and an adequate record to be made
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:33.360]  about what was actually going on in Minnesota
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:35.360]  during this trial.
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:37.360]  Did the trial take place in a place
[2:07:37.360 --> 2:07:39.360]  where jurors felt free to vote
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:41.360]  what they saw, what they believed,
[2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:43.360]  or did they feel intimidated,
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:45.360]  perhaps by the smell of smoke in the air,
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:47.360]  hearing the chants of no justice,
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:49.360]  no peace, driving to the courthouse
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:52.360]  through boarded streets, or hearing Maxine Waters
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:54.360]  come in and say, if you don't say
[2:07:54.360 --> 2:07:56.360]  guilty, guilty, guilty, there's going to be
[2:07:56.360 --> 2:07:58.360]  hell to pay? This is the United States?
[2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:00.360]  I don't think so.
[2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:02.360]  Let me ask you this.
[2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:04.360]  Obviously, the left wants control.
[2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:06.360]  Soros is putting in most of the DAs,
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  a lot of the attorney generals.
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:10.360]  They want to be able to have the media
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:12.360]  attack a department when they want,
[2:08:12.360 --> 2:08:14.360]  not attack it when they want.
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:16.360]  This is all about political power.
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:18.360]  What is the state building and local police
[2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:20.360]  departments about?
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:22.360]  If you're mad at the police,
[2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:24.360]  change the mayor, change the governor.
[2:08:24.360 --> 2:08:26.360]  The idea of just scapegoating cops,
[2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:28.360]  I'm not even a police file.
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:30.360]  I'm not like a worshiper to police.
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:32.360]  I just know that it's not the proper place
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:34.360]  to say all the powers there and attack them.
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:36.360]  It looks to me like the ruling class
[2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:38.360]  is diverting down to the police.
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:40.360]  I don't know about that.
[2:08:40.360 --> 2:08:42.360]  I know that the police is the face of the state.
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:44.360]  The state has a monopoly
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:46.360]  on the legitimate use of force and officers.
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:48.360]  That's what I'm saying is the state
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:50.360]  is scapegoating its tires.
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:52.360]  It's like the cars up here,
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:54.360]  it's blaming its tires.
[2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:56.360]  The drivers what's running over people.
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:08:58.360]  I don't know what the end game is
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.360]  because when the streets become pure chaos,
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:02.360]  I'm sure not going to call
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:04.360]  Black Lives Matter if somebody's
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:06.360]  breaking my door down the night.
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:08.360]  I'm dialing 911 and hoping somebody
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:10.360]  like Derek Chalvin responds to the call.
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:12.360]  I've watched all 48 minutes
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:14.360]  of that trial video several times
[2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:16.360]  and there's very little question
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:18.360]  in my mind that Chalvin should be
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:20.360]  acquitted completely of these charges.
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:22.360]  Let's talk about that now in the next segment.
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:24.360]  It's like he's babysitting a giant
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:26.360]  drug addict out of control.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:28.360]  You feel sorry for him?
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:30.360]  Up until the very end
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.360]  and the dispute about whether
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:34.360]  there was a knee to the neck or not,
[2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.360]  it's a training video on how to deal
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:38.360]  with an impaired, psychotic
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:40.360]  and probably intoxicated person.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:42.360]  That's what it is.
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.360]  In the end, there are questions of fact
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:46.360]  whether the knee was on the neck or the shoulder.
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:48.360]  There is no medical evidence
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:50.360]  on mechanism of death as to suffocation
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.360]  and there was evidence that he had
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:54.360]  enough fentanyl in him to kill him.
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:56.360]  Had he been found dead without anything else,
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:58.360]  they would have concluded that as a potential cause
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.360]  of death or he had heart disease as well.
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:02.360]  Now, the prosecution claimed
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:04.360]  he lived some 17,000 days
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:06.360]  and he died on this particular day
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:08.360]  because of what the police did.
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:10.360]  He certainly was susceptible to the effects
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:12.360]  of stress and the police
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:14.360]  did not raise stress or.
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:16.360]  But here is the honest fact.
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:18.360]  There is one person who is indisputably responsible
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  for setting into motion the facts
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:22.360]  that led to George Floyd's death
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.360]  and that's George Floyd.
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:26.360]  People want to say, oh, he's not on the line.
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:28.360]  That's when rioters get shot.
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:30.360]  You're going to riot waving a gun around.
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:32.360]  That's when you get your ass killed at.
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:34.360]  You went there, you're looking for a fight,
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:36.360]  you're going to get it.
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:38.360]  We're going to come back and talk about all that.
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.360]  Nobody is glad that George Floyd is dead.
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.360]  He failed.
[2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:44.360]  They're right back with Norm Pattis, infowars.com.
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:46.360]  Newswars.com will continually carry
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:48.360]  a lot of his great writing.
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:50.360]  Epic is one of only a handful
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:52.360]  of domain registers
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  that promote free speech
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:56.360]  and freedom of association.
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:58.360]  And they know that big tech
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:00.360]  is buying up almost all the other major companies
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:02.360]  and engaging in massive censorship
[2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:04.360]  and organized crime racketeering.
[2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:06.360]  That's why they've been massively expanding
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:08.360]  their services. So whether you have
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:10.360]  domains or want to register a domain
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:12.360]  or want help building a website or want servers
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  or any other major service,
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:16.360]  they've got it all and they're expanding.
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:18.360]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  and follow that link,

[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:26.360]  of your sign up for a new domain
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:28.360]  or a domain you move goes to fund the info war
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.360]  and then we get 5% as well
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:32.360]  for any servers or any other type
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:34.360]  of services that you get from them.
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  So it's a win-win as we build
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:38.360]  open free internet again
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:40.360]  because the globalists are destroying
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:42.360]  what was open and what was free.
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:44.360]  So infowarsdomains.com
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:46.360]  the revolution starts there.
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:48.360]  infowarsdomains.com
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:50.360]  take action now.
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:52.360]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:54.360]  in mid-April 2021
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:56.360]  and I just want to say something.
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:11:58.360]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:00.360]  that has come together over the years
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:02.360]  and has truly answered a prayer
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:04.360]  and I am so blessed and thankful
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:06.360]  that I love you and I appreciate you.
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:08.360]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:10.360]  white black, it doesn't matter you got red blood.
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:12.360]  And if you love freedom and justice
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:14.360]  and if you love our innocent children
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:16.360]  we are brothers and sisters
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:18.360]  together and it has just been
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:20.360]  an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:22.360]  And as crazy as things are
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:24.360]  I want to keep working under the future.
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:26.360]  But again that's really
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.360]  up to you and up to God.
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:30.360]  So please, I hope God works through you
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:32.360]  and puts a message in your heart
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:34.360]  to support us.
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  Again that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:38.360]  I just want to thank you all for the years
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:40.360]  of support you've given us and what you've done
[2:12:40.360 --> 2:12:42.360]  and just ask you again to pray to God
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:44.360]  and ask what God's vision is for you
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:46.360]  and hopefully God will touch your heart
[2:12:46.360 --> 2:13:12.360]  and give you the most important force. God bless.
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:18.360]  Yeah, I saw him.
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:20.360]  The great reset.
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:22.360]  Coming for me.
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:24.360]  I said if I am guilty I will pay.
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:26.360]  But I didn't.
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:28.360]  Shoot the devil.
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:30.360]  I shot the sheriff.
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:32.360]  What do I do?
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:34.360]  He's in self-defense.
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:36.360]  I didn't shoot the devil.
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.360]  I shot the sheriff.
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:40.360]  What do I do?
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:42.360]  He's in self-defense.
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:44.360]  What do I do?
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:46.360]  I shot the sheriff.
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:48.360]  What do I do?
[2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:50.360]  He's in self-defense.
[2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:52.360]  Alright
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:54.360]  Norm Paddice, you are kicking ass here with us
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:56.360]  as usual.
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:13:58.360]  Looking at this, I mean look if that cop
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:00.360]  did something bad fry his ass
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:02.360]  but clearly he didn't want to go to jail.
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:04.360]  Clearly he made a mistake, whatever happened.
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:06.360]  The guy was bombed out of his brain
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:08.360]  on fentanyl.
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:10.360]  Why does the media want
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:12.360]  burning cities?
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:17.720]  do they want collapse of the country? Why do they, why don't they talk about China and
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:21.800]  death camps it runs? Why don't they talk about the sex slavery on the border? No, no, no,
[2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:28.640]  it's all about black on white. It's obviously a political distraction. And I think Pelosi's
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:34.720]  minion, her attack dog, Mad Maxine, really stepped in it because they want to put everybody
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:39.320]  that even was at the Capitol in jail, but then she's calling for violence. How are they
[2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:43.800]  going to square that? It seems like what Maxine did kind of messed up what they were planning.
[2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:46.800]  Your take on that.
[2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:50.880]  I mean, I wish you could show some other picture than that. I'm really trying to be, to be
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:55.040]  composed here and you show Maxine and they're scary. She scares the life out of me. I, you
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:14:59.180]  know, Alex, I think the country's, you know, whether, whether the left or there are a group
[2:14:59.180 --> 2:15:03.720]  of people who are dividing us for purpose of control and for conquer, that that's an
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:07.240]  open question. That's beyond my pay grade. I'm a trench lawyer. I go to court every day
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:12.240]  and I fight in courtrooms, but here's what I see. You know, I see a country that is rapidly
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:17.160]  polarizing on the basis of identity and candidly, Alice, we're spending capital with that took
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:21.960]  centuries to acquire this country was founded on exactly our whole new processes being dumped
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:24.320]  down a black hole.
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:28.000]  That's exactly right. And now we've gone down to identity. We cherish difference for the
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:31.900]  sake of difference. We were in a situation where parents could be accused of risk of
[2:15:31.900 --> 2:15:36.720]  injury to a minor by not heating their, their minor children's desire for sex change operations.
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:41.520]  I mean, it's just absolutely insane. And I don't really know who benefits from this.
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:46.560]  It's hard to imagine that anyone does. But as to, well, and yeah, you know, that, that
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:51.760]  would be, that would be one candidate. But as to, as to the politics of it, as to what
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.440]  goes on in a courtroom, you know, there is a powerful move, a movement of foot for reparations
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:16:01.040]  in this country and the claim that somehow we the living, oh, a debt based on under law,
[2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:05.600]  imagine that if my dad did something wrong or my grandfather, the idea that if they did
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:09.960]  a murder, I go to jail, that's authoritarianism. Explain that because under the old Soviet
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:13.800]  Union or the Nazis, if your family did something wrong, you got in trouble. That's the opposite
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:16.240]  of America, isn't it?
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:21.160]  We there, America, we resolved there in order to get a case into court, the United States
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:25.120]  Supreme Court has held there must be a case or controversy. You don't go to court unless
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:28.960]  there's a case or controversy. And those controversies are between individuals. Right
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:34.720]  now we're treating individuals as mere symbols for other things. Thus, in the Chauvin case,
[2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:39.260]  people talk about this case as inspiring a need for a racial reckoning. This case had
[2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:47.640]  zero to do with race. Zero. Since 2015, roughly 1000 people per year are shot to death by
[2:16:47.640 --> 2:16:53.120]  police officers. You know, Floyd wasn't even shot. He died there. But I won't, I don't,
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:57.960]  I disagree with you, Alex. I do not believe it is indisputable that Chauvin caused his
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:02.480]  death. I think that it's entirely possible on this evidence to conclude that while he
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:07.640]  was arrested and Chauvin had the lawful authority to take him into custody, Chauvin did not
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:08.640]  cause him death.
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:11.400]  Oh, no, let me clear. I'm not saying that he probably didn't die three times the fentanyl
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:15.000]  in his body. I'm saying devil's advocate, he didn't do it consciously.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:18.800]  No, well, there's no question. He's not even charged with intentional manslaughter. He's
[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:23.120]  charged basically with what's called felony murder. It's not put that way in Minnesota,
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:27.000]  but he's charged with Floyd's dying during the commission of another felony, that felony
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  being his cell.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.520]  So that Max, he doesn't even understand that she's like, oh, manslaughter is not enough.
[2:17:31.520 --> 2:17:35.680]  He goes, I want Capital One, basically. Well, he's not even charged with that, so she won't
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:37.280]  give what she wants.
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:43.080]  Of course not. She's a tool. I mean, somehow she has served for the people of California
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:48.040]  in Congress for 30 years, three decades, and prior to that, she had 15 years in the California
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:50.800]  General Assembly. If ever there were a reason for it.
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:55.480]  By the way, put her face up. She's under lights, like 10 lights are on her to press conference,
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:18:00.560]  and she's got almost pure pupils. From my research, you've got to at least, we're talking
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:05.320]  10 lines of methamphetamine, cocaine, or LSD to do that. I mean, those eyes are, she
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:08.640]  is jacked. What the hell is she on, man?
[2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:13.960]  She's, I mean, she's on cell. Seriously. Look, I'll bet anybody a million dollars.
[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:18.760]  You can't shine bright lights in somebody's eyeballs and have them be 95% pupil. I mean,
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:21.280]  look at that. God almighty.
[2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:24.160]  I don't understand enough of the physiology of pupil dilation.
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:28.120]  Well, let me give you a newsflash. Any police training you're, let me tell you, if there
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:31.760]  were like half that size, the police would arrest you. Go ahead. I mean, that's like
[2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:38.840]  overdose levels to see, you know, the watch, the Washington had a sub dermal hematoma. If
[2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:42.720]  somebody had like punctured her brain with a hatchet, her eyes would look like that.
[2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:43.720]  Sorry. Go ahead.
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:48.840]  No, the Washington Post reported she couldn't sleep. So she traveled to Minneapolis, the
[2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:51.000]  suburban Minneapolis to make her speech.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.120]  Exactly. Probably 10 lines of methamphetamine.
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  I don't know what self-righteous fumes she was on that day, but the notion that a sitting
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:06.080]  congressperson could be in a community with an active trial of this sort going on, making
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:10.440]  threats that are calculated to get to the jury and incite the community renders her
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:12.960]  unfit to serve as a congressman.
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:16.360]  You know, does she have a right to that speech? Absolutely. I've always defended the right
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:21.520]  for free speech and vigorous speech and even impolitique and uncomfortable speech, speech
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:25.400]  that makes us uncomfortable. I defend her right to say those things, even though they're
[2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:26.400]  troubling.
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:28.600]  No, no, I agree, but she's trying to influence the jury. That's different, correct?
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:33.280]  Well, so the law on jury tampering, you know, it's difficult. The fully informed jury association,
[2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:37.240]  for example, sends people outside of courthouses to pass pamphlets out to folks saying you
[2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:38.240]  have a right to...
[2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:40.800]  Sure, I have a right to judge the law on the facts. What I'm asking you is, you said
[2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:44.520]  what she does is abhorrent. How is it abhorrent then?
[2:19:44.520 --> 2:19:48.680]  Because she's a member of Congress and she's supposed to promote respect for our fundamental
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:49.680]  institution.
[2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:53.400]  She's another branch of government coming in and telling the other branch, I'm in control
[2:19:53.400 --> 2:19:56.000]  of you.
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:01.920]  She was a direct assault on the integrity of the jury system and she should not be forgiven
[2:20:01.920 --> 2:20:06.560]  for it. I think each one of your viewers should call their congressman and demand that those
[2:20:06.560 --> 2:20:08.320]  congressmen take action as to what...
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:12.360]  And I agree with you particularly because she wants everybody at the Capitol arrested,
[2:20:12.360 --> 2:20:14.960]  even if they weren't violent. So she asked for it.
[2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:20.240]  Well, you know, what she did, there are very few things I saw in the tapes of what took
[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:26.400]  place on January 6th that were as disturbing as what Maxine Water did. Maxine Waters basically
[2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:32.360]  declared war on the jury system. And she basically said, if you don't give us what we want, we're
[2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:36.560]  going to take it. We need to send a message to them. She is driving a dagger into the
[2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:41.720]  heart and soul of the United States and she is supposed to be a leader, not a rabble rouser.
[2:20:41.720 --> 2:20:45.320]  You know, I mean, it's as though Al Sharpton had become president and decided that Tawana
[2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:48.840]  Brawley was going to... Brawley or whatever her name was, is going to be our minister
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:49.840]  of interior.
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:54.960]  It doesn't work this way, people. We have juries resolve issues to build communities, not break
[2:20:54.960 --> 2:20:55.960]  them in two.
[2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:59.440]  Who benefits from this, Alex? I listen to you as your viewers' duty, hear your thoughts
[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:00.440]  on the matter.
[2:21:00.440 --> 2:21:05.680]  For me, nobody benefits in it. We are becoming a failed state. And if things get pressed
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:11.040]  to the point of breaking, there could be actual violence in this country. And if we polarize
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:16.240]  on distinct groups, there could be something like civil war. To me, that is terrifying.
[2:21:16.240 --> 2:21:20.080]  The American experiment has succeeded for several centuries because we're a pragmatic
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:24.480]  people who've learned to come together, to reason together. And the quintessential forer
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:29.080]  for doing that is in a jury. And if you attack the jury system, it's as though...
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:32.720]  You're attacking the people. You're attacking we, the people, making decisions. All right,
[2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:37.000]  Darv Patis, amazing job. Tell folks about your blog. Is it Patis Blogged Up?
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:42.240]  Yep, and I've started a new podcast, Law and Legitimacy. Come check me out. I think there's
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:44.400]  something wrong in the world, and I'm trying to diagnose you with it.
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:47.680]  Join us again tomorrow or tonight, as this unfolds.
[2:21:47.680 --> 2:21:53.360]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:58.680]  full verses that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together. But I'll tell
[2:21:58.680 --> 2:22:05.440]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying to destroy
[2:22:05.440 --> 2:22:10.720]  all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance.
[2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:16.520]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been pretty inaccurate.
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:20.280]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true. So it's now that
[2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:25.160]  your credibility is way up. The power structure should have silenced those of us that they
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:33.040]  can. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power. But
[2:22:33.040 --> 2:22:38.320]  if the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech, we have to make sure that
[2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:43.120]  we find hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come. So be the
[2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:48.520]  polar bears you are.
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:52.840]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:57.520]  has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including

[2:23:48.320 --> 2:23:53.480]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with
[2:23:53.480 --> 2:23:56.920]  the globalist, attacking humanity, and all the terrible things that are unfolding, I
[2:23:56.920 --> 2:24:02.600]  want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure,
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:06.480]  so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's
[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:12.440]  police chiefs or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media,
[2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:17.880]  or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment. They don't want to go
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:22.520]  along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:27.000]  what infowarstore.com comes in. You fund us, you support infowarstore.com, you get rape
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:31.960]  proxy at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular,
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:36.920]  what the globalist will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:43.280]  and to take the heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:48.800]  so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at infowarstore.com.
[2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:58.800]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:05.880]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:11.480]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:17.840]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. The globalist
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:22.200]  fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:25.960]  It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in-game. Blueprint for global enslavement
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:30.520]  available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:36.040]  of it anywhere in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:40.320]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:43.840]  you tell others that you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:52.200]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:26:17.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:28.400]  Well, I interviewed people who are consistently right and who have a pro-human moral compass.
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:32.200]  They have a lot of smart guests on. Robert Barnes is just one of the top lawyers in the
[2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:36.480]  country. He's also a really smart historian because you can't fake that stuff when I talk
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:40.320]  to him over long dinners and cigars. He knows what he's talking about. A lot of times he
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:44.240]  teaches me something, which is a good thing because I want to learn more. Most people
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:50.200]  think history is some weird thing. So we can talk about, even though it's an example of
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:55.160]  past human behavior, which is the greatest prediction of future behavior, we can talk
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:27:01.280]  about pig blood and pig heads on witnesses' doors and attacks on jurors' houses and Maxine
[2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:05.480]  Waters and AOC. And that's all important. But it's all window dressing on the other
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:09.240]  day and I'm sure he'll still address it. But Robert Barnes is cutting right to the chase.
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:16.080]  What is this about? What is this attack on local government about? What is this manipulation
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:21.120]  of the facts about? Why are they doing this? What do they want? And what is your prediction
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:25.120]  with the jury out now entering the second day about what's going to unfold? Thanks for
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:27.120]  joining us.
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:34.120]  It's about the taking mob justice into the courtroom and converting our juries into mobs.
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:41.040]  And that's why yesterday you had the judge not only condemn Congresswoman Waters state
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:46.880]  that what she did by itself might be grounds to vacate the verdict. But on top of all of
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:54.320]  that, beg all elected officials to quit commenting on the case until the jury came back. And
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:59.480]  what happened within 24 hours? The mayor of Minneapolis commented on the case. The mayor
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:04.080]  of St. Paul commented on the case. The governor of the state of Minnesota commented on the
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:09.560]  case. And today, the president of the United States commented on the case. So not only
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:14.840]  did they ignore him, they slapped him in the face because they want mob justice to become
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:19.920]  a de facto reality in America, but they want to do it through the jury trial system like
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:24.960]  we're 1950s Birmingham rather than 1776 America.
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:30.420]  I totally agree. And this goes back to Bolshevik hysteria, Maoist hysteria with sorrows taken
[2:28:30.420 --> 2:28:34.240]  over most of the district attorneys and county attorneys and attorney generals. This is what
[2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:38.240]  they admit it's their plan. And now it's not to intimidate the police, it's intimidate
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:44.080]  the juries, not just to tackle the judiciary, but the very fabric of English common law.
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:49.640]  Explain that to people. I mean, the fundamental revolution of juries
[2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:54.080]  deciding justice of juries deciding truth of juries deciding.
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:29:00.160]  This is the basis of everything. Absolutely. And it was revolutionary. I mean, it was the
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:05.120]  Knights recognizing that they could not get fair justice unless other Knights sat in judgment
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:10.640]  of them and they could not trust the patrician class or the royal class to govern them and
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:14.120]  to make people say, well, that wasn't perfect. They were the Knights. It was the nobility,
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:18.480]  the Lord's saying the king's not God. As soon as they said that, it devolved down to the
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:22.000]  commoners. This is the basics of everything we know is freedom.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:28.520]  Exactly. The whole point of American liberty, the whole ideal is protected by independent
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:34.360]  juries making independent decisions based on facts and law and conscience and not being
[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:38.640]  influenced by the mob. It's like you said on the show yesterday, it's about AI and computers
[2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:43.960]  taking over because, quote, humans are imperfect. The military cars, helicopters, planes and
[2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:49.560]  now juries, this is what's happening. Oh, correct. I mean, I mean, ultimately what's
[2:29:49.560 --> 2:29:53.440]  going to happen is that you have the entire jury, not only do you have the whole point
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:58.680]  of a jury trial is to not have mob justice. It's the counter to mob justice. It's the
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:04.980]  opposite point to mob justice. It's the remedy to mob justice. So by trying to create mob
[2:30:04.980 --> 2:30:10.960]  justice inside the courtroom and convert the jury into a mob, they are completely defeating
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:16.600]  the entire point of jury trial justice. And maybe their goal, much like with policing,
[2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:21.880]  will be to ultimately replace juries. Exactly. Why the bold assault? Why are they so arrogant?
[2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:26.160]  How do we counter this? Because this should really threaten all Americans. This is just
[2:30:26.160 --> 2:30:31.480]  as bad as going after free speech or guns. But one of the greatest protection against
[2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:37.600]  total control by the state is the jury system, because it's ordinary, everyday people coming
[2:30:37.600 --> 2:30:42.680]  together. It says the power of the judiciary lies with the people. Absolutely. The power
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:48.400]  of the state is in the power of the jury. And it's a check on politicians. It's a check
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:56.520]  on abusive state. And the media wants the power to misquote, misphrase, miscript, misrepresent.
[2:30:56.520 --> 2:31:01.280]  And then the media wants the power. Like what we say, jury's got to do. Exactly. You see
[2:31:01.280 --> 2:31:07.640]  the frustration yesterday where the legal analyst for CNN, the legal analyst for NBC
[2:31:07.640 --> 2:31:12.480]  were saying things like, I can't believe this guy is talking about reasonable doubt. I can't
[2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:16.960]  believe this guy is talking about presumption of innocence. They're so outraged and offended
[2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:22.440]  that ordinary people are able to rebut, potentially, the immediate narrative. They are outraged
[2:31:22.440 --> 2:31:28.480]  by our own sacred rights paid for by 800 years of war and death. Correct. Because they want
[2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:32.800]  to, it's all about control in the end of the day. Who has control? Because the media wants
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:37.280]  control. The politicians want control. The state wants control. And America's not perfect.
[2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:41.880]  Everyone wanted to come to England and America because we invented the commoner having rights,
[2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:46.320]  your home being your castle. This is literally the greatest assault ever. The in run around
[2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:52.000]  our guns, our speech, our everything. If they can get rid of juries, they win. Absolutely.
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:55.600]  Because I mean jury trials is the reason why we don't have mob justice. Jury trials is
[2:31:55.600 --> 2:31:59.960]  the reason why we don't have the state ability to put people in prison interminably without
[2:31:59.960 --> 2:32:04.640]  a jury determination of what was true and what was right and what was wrong. And the
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:10.320]  jury is the great guardian of American liberty. Remove the jury and you remove the last standing
[2:32:10.320 --> 2:32:14.800]  guardian to the American liberty. And that's why they're trying to do. That's why the onslaught
[2:32:14.800 --> 2:32:19.880]  and assault on the jury system itself in the chauvin trial. That's why you have the president
[2:32:19.880 --> 2:32:24.520]  of the United States trying to infiltrate and inflame the court of public opinion to
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:30.220]  bias and prejudice the jury and the jury outcome. So it's a great threat to the fundamental
[2:32:30.220 --> 2:32:34.240]  liberties of all Americans. If jury trial protections are removed, what about the blood
[2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:39.560]  thrown on the witness's house harassing CBS doxing the jury? It should be a mystery all
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:45.000]  right there, right? That's no brainer. It's just compounding the issue. You see why a
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:50.400]  bunch of experts would not even testify on chauvin's behalf in behest. No, it's like
[2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:53.760]  I can't even you don't have you're my lawyer. You're not a coward. Other lawyers are all
[2:32:53.760 --> 2:32:57.800]  scared represent me because they'll get harassed. Oh, completely. I mean, that's what they're
[2:32:57.800 --> 2:33:02.400]  doing. It's a new level of lawfare. If you're an expert, if you're a lawyer, you better
[2:33:02.400 --> 2:33:06.880]  not represent people they don't want represented. If you're an expert, you better not testify.
[2:33:06.880 --> 2:33:12.640]  If you're a witness, you better not testify. It's mob intimidation. This is the way Latin
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:17.320]  America fell the last 50 years, right? Same crap happened. Well, the reason why we put
[2:33:17.320 --> 2:33:23.200]  in the jury trial system is because it's a critical procedural protection to core substantive
[2:33:23.200 --> 2:33:27.720]  rights. The best way to make sure certain rights are defended to make sure ordinary
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:32.680]  everyday people are the ones who safeguard those rights. They are the chairs. They are
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:37.640]  the ones who chairs liberty. When I was defending Wesley Snipes in the Snipes case, the I use
[2:33:37.640 --> 2:33:41.360]  the reference the Liberty Bell could be cracked in Philadelphia, but it could still be heard
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:45.960]  in Ocala, which led to all the felony acquittals in that case, because it was the jurors who
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:50.200]  believed in that liberty and would protect it and safeguard it. An attack on the jury
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:55.440]  is an attack on America. What is your gut level prediction about this? Can the jury
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:59.400]  withstand this level of threat? Because obviously the officer didn't do this premeditatedly.
[2:33:59.400 --> 2:34:04.920]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but he didn't do this on purpose. What do you think happens?
[2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:09.320]  It will be a great testament to the capability of the American people if the jurors return
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:14.320]  not guilty verdicts at any level, but especially if they return it on all charges, but definitely
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:18.680]  on the top charges, because he was willing to plead to the middle charge. So if he's
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:23.360]  acquitted of the top charge, then the outcome is no different than the outcome he was willing
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:27.960]  to plead to. So the big question is, do they come back not guilty on felony murder? And
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:32.160]  if they do, it is a great testament to the power and conscience, because these will be
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:37.520]  a liberal jury. This will be a democratic leaning jury. These will be Biden voting jurors.
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:42.960]  This is a very racially diverse jury. If even that jury pool comes in and says, you know
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:46.720]  what, the evidence shows that this person wasn't guilty and I don't care what threats
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:51.320]  there are, I'm going to do justice and say truth regardless. It will be a great testament
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:55.440]  to the power of the conscience of the American people to resist this kind of political mob
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:34:59.960]  pressure from the political class that wishes to destroy the jury system in America.
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:04.440]  30 seconds to break, but what about reverse psychology? Couldn't Maxine threatening the
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:10.720]  jury backfire and make them go screw you? Or do you think they'll be cowards and conventionally?
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:13.400]  Well the way I think of it is think if you're an ordinary person and you have family and
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:18.040]  you have property in Minnesota. And here you're seeing powerful, well-recognized public officials
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:23.160]  say you better convict or else. And you just had a bunch of prosecutors tell you basically
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:29.680]  you better convict or else. So I think they will have to be extraordinarily heroic to stand
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:32.720]  up to the mob pressure and return in acquittal and not guilty.
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:37.360]  Well, let's get your prediction. Will they acquit Robert Barnes? We'll give us this prediction.
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:42.680]  We'll come back in a few minutes. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:47.440]  Tomorrow's news today. They hope you don't share those URLs.
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:52.920]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative. Well, for me, admitting
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:58.400]  I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative. It hurts, it
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:02.800]  stinks, it's got pus coming out of it. I go to the doctor, they fix it. That's not negative.
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:07.560]  I'm not living in denial. And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:13.000]  that we feel yet, but now it's come to the surface. That's actually a positive thing.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:17.280]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job. They stole the election. We can't get down
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:24.080]  about that. We have forced them out in the open. So now they're trying to suppress us
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:27.960]  because they know they've been exposed. They're scared. That's why, instead of saying, oh,
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:31.360]  we're a bunch of losers, look what happened. No, we're a bunch of winners. They're trying
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:36.520]  to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening. Your
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:41.320]  own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos, just keep sharing
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:45.640]  however you can and realize we're in an information war. We're going to win this together and
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:52.280]  the fight starts at fours.com. Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:58.000]  promote free speech and freedom of association. And they know that big tech is buying up almost
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:02.480]  all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:07.240]  racketeering. That's why they've been massively expanding their services. So whether you have
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:11.320]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:18.160]  any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding. And if you go to infowarsdomains.com
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:24.320]  and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up
[2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:29.560]  for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war. Then we get 5% as well
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:34.000]  for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them. So it's a win-win
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:38.520]  as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:46.320]  was open and what was free. So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there. infowarsdomains.com.
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:50.320]  Take action now.
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:56.400]  Randy Dewright. Randy Dewright. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:02.000]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:06.560]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:12.400]  up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:19.800]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:23.720]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:28.000]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.960]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:38.120]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know,
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:44.400]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:49.120]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:59.160]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:06.720]  world. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination? For thousands
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:12.480]  of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:19.240]  great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand. The globalist fear this film made
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:23.080]  14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to bigger the world. It is the blueprint
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:27.360]  for the great reset. It is in game blueprint for global enslavement available right now
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:31.480]  at infoorstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:36.880]  in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in game at infoorstore.com. I strongly
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:41.000]  suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand you tell
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:44.280]  others that you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well. That will
[2:39:44.280 --> 2:39:51.760]  trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:40:03.520]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:23.200]  All right. Final segment of this hour. Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over from
[2:40:23.200 --> 2:40:29.600]  the U.K. then the war room with the great Tom Pappert is going to be hosting that today.
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:40.920]  He has been on my show a lot. Other people have been on the show. People don't usually
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:47.200]  use terms like this. This is unprecedented. It is like whatever a convention is, whatever
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:54.320]  chivalry is, whatever polite society is, the left just tramples it like oh, that must be
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:58.360]  where the power is. No, that is where war and death and failure is. We had chivalry
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:06.800]  in due process to not do that again. And they are just plunging us into collapse, into conflict
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:12.880]  and flailing around. But I don't want to just blame them. What is it about what we as a
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:16.720]  society, whether you are a man or a woman or whether you have a bunch of melanin in
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:20.920]  your skin or not, what is it instead of always, I don't want to be like them blaming somebody
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:27.720]  else. What have we done? What have I done, Robert Barnes, to let them act like this?
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:32.040]  Because they are a bunch of clowns that are burning down our society. But I don't want
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:36.600]  to just blame them. What did we do to let these lunatics get to this point? And how
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:38.560]  do we counter people like this?
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:43.320]  Well, it sort of starts with the culture itself. The politics is downstream from culture and
[2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:48.560]  the sort of the entire safe space movement that arose out of sort of the moral panic
[2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:54.600]  about kindergartens at elementary schools and daycare centers in the 90s, going to all
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:41:58.680]  of those range of cases where a lot of stories were told by the prosecutors that ended up
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:03.280]  being false, created sort of a play date culture where we weren't allowed to let our kids
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:06.040]  go out in the street and just play with random strangers to have fun.
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:09.200]  So you're saying the nanny state has created a lot of neuroses and now they can leverage
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:10.720]  that in anything they want.
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:15.280]  Correct. In fact, they are shocked by the idea that you are supposed to, I mean that
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:20.000]  led to safe space culture, which led to you are not supposed to have independent opinions,
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.800]  which said you are not allowed to platform disagreeable opinions, whether it is in the
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:25.600]  classroom or in the media.
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:29.640]  And what that produces is a group of people who are shocked even by the idea of things
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:34.360]  that have been fundamental to the American liberty and legal experiment for three centuries
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:39.480]  and to the idea of the Western Enlightenment legal experience for eight centuries, things
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:43.720]  like reasonable doubt, things like presumption of innocence, things like the adversarial
[2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:47.000]  process to ascertain truth and justice.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:51.920]  All of the very goals not only of American society and American constitutionalism, but
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:58.560]  of the Enlightenment principles that underline it are all directed assault on all known true
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:02.360]  liberal values by fascists calling themselves liberal.
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:03.520]  You want to explain that?
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:08.520]  Oh, exactly. I mean, when people sort of go back, it's sort of like what the fascist
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:13.680]  did and what the communists did. Both. They were both statist at heart, who believed in
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:18.080]  a higher cause that replaced both God and constitutional liberty and individual.
[2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:21.880]  Hitler and Stalin said, I'll do whatever I want because I'm in power and my ultimate
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:25.360]  goal and they just ignore everything.
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.080]  Absolutely. They ignored not only the church and the limits and restraints of it. They ignored
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:33.520]  the constitutional liberty and democratizing power. What they both had in common was the
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.160]  refusal to allow elections to be a check on their process or refusal to allow independent
[2:43:38.160 --> 2:43:39.880]  juries to be a check on their process.
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:43.880]  And that's the key is they play this game like I'll have no check on me. No, if we agree
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:48.880]  on a ceiling of stuff, we don't burn everything out and kill each other. Like they take it
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:52.880]  as weakness, Bob, that we want a ceiling. No, we could be worse than you. We want an
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:56.120]  agreed upon rules of the game, you idiots.
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:44:00.120]  Absolutely. And to give it like here's an example where people can push back. You look
[2:44:00.120 --> 2:44:05.160]  at the Kyle Rittenhouse case where what happens is people donate the Kyle Rittenhouse. Somebody
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:07.680]  hacks one of the Christian groups that did the money.
[2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:11.880]  And the media ghost had threatened somebody that gave him $10 at their house.
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:16.880]  Exactly. And they're trying to go after any state employee who gave money, any sheriff
[2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:21.320]  who gave money, any paramedic who gave money. And their goal is to do what the same thing
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:26.400]  they want to do to the Chauvin trial jury is they want to dox them and defame them and
[2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:27.400]  destroy them.
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:30.880]  And why don't they get that keeps backfiring? It's not intimidating people.
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:36.320]  Correct. In fact, that's the key is when they see it doesn't lead to lower donations.
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:40.080]  But it's like Scott Adams yesterday said he was going to make a donation and promote
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:45.320]  donations to Kyle Rittenhouse's defense as an answer to this doxing so that to deter
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:49.160]  it and discourage it in the future. And that's what people have to do.
[2:44:49.160 --> 2:44:53.560]  Every time somebody tries to censor somebody, then you share the links to that person. Every
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:58.400]  time there's an attempt to deny people access to deep platform people like they've done
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:04.440]  to InfoWars, the best response is to double down on support of things like infowarestore.com
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:07.440]  where people help make InfoWars capable to keep going.
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:11.040]  It's a revolutionary act. So, Barnes, let me ask you this. Gut level, how do you see
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:14.400]  this trial going? What do you see unfolding? I mean, predictions I know I don't want to
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:18.080]  put you on the spot, but you know, you've been a big better too in politics than one
[2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:22.560]  of the most successful. Gut level, unless things change, where do you see this going?
[2:45:22.560 --> 2:45:25.600]  Well there's one betting market out there that people are betting on the outcome of
[2:45:25.600 --> 2:45:31.480]  the trial. And after they saw closing arguments, the acquittal rate went to the highest rate
[2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:36.480]  it has the entire trial. So that gives you an idea of people's reactions. I broke down
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:41.680]  the jury and my view is it's six people likely lean guilty and six people likely lean not
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:47.720]  guilty. That tends to be a tough split jury that sometimes comes out with a split verdict
[2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:51.960]  or not guilty verdict, but either way it usually doesn't come back with a quick verdict. And
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:56.480]  so far we're seeing no verdict back yesterday, even though they were in for four hours or
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:01.160]  more. No verdict back today, even though they've been in for about four hours or more. So the
[2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:05.640]  sign is that this is going to be a protracted jury process. There's probably deeply held
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:10.120]  opinions, but I think there's people who really believe in the jury. There's a bunch of people
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:15.280]  who in the jury selection process said they believed in the American jury trial process.
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:19.520]  And I think they understand that's what's at trial. That's what's at issue in this case
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:23.200]  as much as anything else related to the case itself. And I think they're going to fight
[2:46:23.200 --> 2:46:27.640]  for it. And I think that there's a decent chance that we get an acquittal. My view is
[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:31.880]  there's about a 50% chance of an acquittal in this case. And that's going to shock the
[2:46:31.880 --> 2:46:35.840]  media. That's going to shock a lot of people who didn't watch the trial, but it would affirm
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:37.920]  the confidence that people rightly have.
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:43.000]  I agree because I think the last straw is threatening the jury. People go, wait, we're
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:46.600]  the bad guys. We're being honest here. I'm a good person. I want to do justice. You're
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:51.520]  saying I'm bad. I'm going to do what you want. That would make me, you know, if I was on
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:55.000]  the knife's edge of which way to go, that would make me acquit.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.400]  Well, the other thing that happens is the prosecutors are overreached. They did sort
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:03.920]  of, you know, they said that they claim that George Floyd died because his heart was too
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:08.400]  big. George Floyd died because Derek Chauvin's heart was too small. And, you know, it was
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:12.640]  somebody trying to beat Johnny Cochran, but a little bit too cute by half. And so they
[2:47:12.640 --> 2:47:18.600]  were so overt in appealing to the basest instincts of the jurors that I think it caused a lot
[2:47:18.600 --> 2:47:24.040]  of jurors. There's bankers, IT people, engineer people on that jury pool that are like, eh,
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:27.840]  I don't like that kind of appeal. I believe in the jury process. I believe.
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:32.480]  So bottom line, do you think threats on the jury backfire and they acquit or do they bow
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:38.240]  down? I think that's an open question. I think it worked with some jurors, didn't work and
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:43.040]  backfired with other jurors. And the question is who wins out in the end. And that's, uh,
[2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:47.120]  we won't know until they come back. We won't know. We'll have a clue when, if they announce
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:52.080]  a four person, if the four person is a certain group of people, then it's likely going to
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:55.520]  come back all guilties. If it's a different group of people, it's likely to come back
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:48:01.200]  not guilties. What's interesting here is the jurors most likely fighting for acquittal
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:06.800]  are likely the African American male jurors in the jury pool. So it's contrary to the
[2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:11.600]  media's narrative. Uh, that in fact, a lot of African American men who look at the facts
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:16.520]  of this case, based on what they said before the jury, uh, during the jury selection was
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:20.240]  they had serious doubts about whether Chauvin was guilty of anything and they see the police
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:24.880]  as necessary and protective. And so it doesn't fit the media's narrative that wants to promote
[2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:30.240]  racial division. Just as we saw record levels of African American male support for Trump,
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:34.880]  for any Republican candidate in 40 years, we may see if there's acquittals in this case
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:40.880]  at any level, it will be led by African American men. What? I mean, regardless, he gets led
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:46.000]  off. There's going to be riots. How do we respond to that? Well, you see what's happening.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:49.600]  The National Guard's already been deployed to Minneapolis. They're locking down places
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:54.920]  in cities all across America. And that's the other thing that not only Maxine Waters,
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:59.800]  but Joe Biden and the mayor and the governor of Minnesota are deliberately inflaming. They're
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:04.280]  inflaming. They want the capitals surrounded with barbed wires. They want the country.
[2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:07.720]  They want martial law. They want control. That's why they're doing it. We should see
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:13.280]  it and come out against it. We're sorry for, we're sorry for Floyd. We're sorry for Chauvin.
[2:49:13.280 --> 2:49:17.560]  The whole thing's a mess. And we should not let them use this against us. Robert Barnes,
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:20.760]  thank you so much. How do people find you on Twitter? How do they find you on rumble?
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:24.800]  How do they find you on, you're on a bunch of things. How people find you? Best place
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:30.240]  to find me is at Viva BarnesLaw.locals.com. That's where I store all the information
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:35.880]  and data in sort of a one stop shop location. And it's free of big tech censorship and control.
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  So that's why we're there.
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:39.960]  All right. Well, I want to invite you and your Canadian lawyer friend on anytime you
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:45.400]  guys want to go. I was thinking Barnes. Hey, glad to be here. All right. Paul Joseph Watson
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:50.520]  is always kicked by. He's about to take over from Her Majesty's United Kingdom. I got a
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:52.920]  few other stories. I'll hit the first five minutes and Paul's going to come on for the
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:57.040]  next 55. So I'll be back with a few stories. And then we're going to hand it over to him.
[2:49:57.040 --> 2:50:03.880]  But wow, what a time to be alive. We got human animal clones. We got pedophile slave camps.
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:07.080]  We got world government. We're worried about blacks and whites killing each other. Let's
[2:50:07.080 --> 2:50:11.120]  knock it off, folks. And let's realize they're bad black people. They're bad white people.
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:15.040]  They're good black people. They're good white people. Now let's stop being idiots. It's
[2:50:15.040 --> 2:50:20.280]  as if they're good cops or bad cops. And if you're a Chai Con global, let's take over.
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:28.000]  Do you want to get us fighting with each other? And this is so obvious and so ridiculous.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.400]  Also, the film in game blueprint for global enslavement has been banned across the Internet
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:40.960]  but it's available now and in forward stores. Every product you hear me on air advertising,
[2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:46.040]  we have in stock in our warehouse in Austin, Texas. Every product. So if you order it,
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:50.520]  you've got it shipped out in a couple of days, sometimes the same day. Losers get confused
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:54.560]  when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking down and its
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:51:00.640]  future orders. It's product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're having
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:06.840]  trouble with. I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times. And it's across
[2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:10.440]  not just the supplement, vitamin, mineral industry. It's across every industry. So
[2:51:10.440 --> 2:51:16.600]  the globalists have successfully devastated the economy. That's why I'm saying you need
[2:51:16.600 --> 2:51:20.840]  to visit infoorstore.com today and get high quality supplements while you still can and
[2:51:20.840 --> 2:51:26.000]  storeable food at infoorstore.com because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship. But
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:30.680]  with the supply chain breakdowns, the prices are going up, availability is going down and
[2:51:30.680 --> 2:51:36.000]  it's just crazy. So please get products while you still can and support the infoorstore.com.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:41.160]  Actually, I bought this at Blocks, UHF frequencies.
[2:51:41.160 --> 2:51:47.320]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[2:51:47.320 --> 2:51:54.440]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:52:02.720]  battery. Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose. Excellent.

[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:20.480]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking

[2:52:41.800 --> 2:52:57.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Well, if I could fund myself with one plug a day,
[2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:02.840]  I'd do it. We're going to talk radio format where we have 14 minutes of ads for local
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:09.480]  radio stations and TV stations. And then I've got a plug or we're not here. It's that simple.
[2:53:09.480 --> 2:53:14.680]  So I really appreciate the viewers and listeners. And we're like just at the point of keeping
[2:53:14.680 --> 2:53:18.600]  everybody employed, fighting, going out on the road and all the great things we do, breaking
[2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:23.440]  all the explosives from your support. So thank you for your support. I would like to get
[2:53:23.440 --> 2:53:29.400]  into the black extra. I'd like to expand. I've got a bunch of huge plans, but I cannot do
[2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:37.520]  it without you. Plus we have amazing products. So the new sale is Alpha Power Mail Vitality
[2:53:37.520 --> 2:53:42.400]  Energy Stamina, known herbs that are healthy and good for your body, very regenerative,
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:47.200]  amazing. There's so many things for your whole body, your bone marrow, you name it. Talk

[2:53:59.240 --> 2:54:04.160]  women as well. All your glands documented for the prostate. And then it's got a bunch
[2:54:04.160 --> 2:54:08.880]  of known vitamins, known minerals. Again, it's basically a multivitamin. So that's why
[2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:13.960]  it is a top seller as well. Then Winter Sun D3 is the king daddy of it all. It's the king
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:19.800]  daddy of it all. It is back in stock, 40% off as well. D3 with vitamin K under the tongues
[2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:24.280]  to get better absorption. It's very sweet naturally. No sweeter needed. Just like vitamin
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:29.320]  B12 sweet as well. We have zero 12, but under the tongue or ultra 12. And it's all right
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:37.160]  there. And Rocket Rest, a very strong, very strong version of down and out liquid formula
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:43.680]  in the dry formula. It's powerful. So look out when you take it deep sleep, blast off
[2:54:43.680 --> 2:54:51.600]  to quick sleep, blast off in the morning with amazing rest of restorative regenerative rest.
[2:54:51.600 --> 2:55:00.080]  Rocket Rest, infowarstore.com or triple A 2533139. And we've sold out for six months of our previously
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:04.120]  our number two seller. And that is a body's ultimate tumor formula. Tumoric construct.
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:08.600]  People love it for its anti-inflammatory and everything else it does. We just can't ever
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:13.240]  seem to get it, but we have the liquid formula that's very similar. Excellent as well. 40%
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:18.560]  off pure tumor liquid extract, selling out fast. But I said it is 40% off because listeners
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:23.920]  keep complaining that we don't have any tumor. We do have tumor, but only a couple of thousand
[2:55:23.920 --> 2:55:28.120]  bottles. And then of course, all T shirts except for the ones on sale, the baseline
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:34.400]  sell 1776. But then we have one special shirt of the day every day for 995. That's basically
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:42.080]  at cost infowarstore.com. And I've got big plans and big things and a lot of reporters
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:46.280]  that we finance that aren't in our name and a lot of groups we support and a lot of organizations
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:51.400]  we boost. But because we're so de-platformed, you don't hear us take the credit. Just believe
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:55.960]  me, we're doing a big job here at info wars. We're having a big effect here at info wars,
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:55:59.640]  but we're having a bigger effect through a lot of other organizations and a lot of other
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:04.000]  groups that are household names. So I want to thank you all for your support. And I want
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:09.960]  to ask you to continue to think about supporting us at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two,

[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:21.000]  are free. And those are just as important or more important in the case of prayer than

[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:56.840]  the great listeners because I'm trying to energize in the face of the enemy. Man, I
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:56:59.840]  went to dinner with James O'Keefe last night. He's like, you never surrender. You never
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:05.600]  back down. You never get in. You just attack, attack, attack. And I'm like, yeah, I'm 47,
[2:57:05.600 --> 2:57:09.840]  you're 20 something and you've been kicking some major, I was just 30 now or whatever.
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:14.480]  I just love hanging out with O'Keefe. It's great energy. God, I wish I was that age again.
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:19.120]  I'm fighting just as hard as he is, but the only way I surrender is if you don't support
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:22.680]  us. And I wouldn't surrender anyways. It's like giving out an engine running out of fuel.
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:30.600]  So please support us. All right, Paul Joseph Watson from the wonderland, the free society,
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:38.520]  the heavenly world of London, Stan, England from the giant Islamic capital of the world.

[2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:08.840]  summit news hour. I am Paul Joseph Watson, breaking news at summit.news. We've got a
[2:59:08.840 --> 2:59:14.600]  raft of news to cover during the show today. Obviously, I'm going to be talking about the
[2:59:14.600 --> 2:59:19.560]  COVID lockdowns because despite the fact that all the evidence coming out of Texas, South
[2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:24.880]  Dakota, Florida, all these other areas where they abandoned their mask mandates, their
[2:59:24.880 --> 2:59:31.320]  social distancing mandates, their coronavirus lockdown restrictions, data shows record low
[2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:38.280]  cases, data shows record low hospitalizations, record low deaths. The facts don't matter
[2:59:38.280 --> 2:59:43.000]  the data doesn't matter. Here in the United Kingdom, we have a prime minister who said
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:51.080]  that the unlocking of the country would be led by data not dates. So we look at the data
[2:59:51.080 --> 2:59:57.440]  and what is the data in the United Kingdom? The data is that on Monday yesterday, across
[2:59:57.440 --> 3:00:06.120]  the entire United Kingdom, we have fewer COVID deaths than road traffic accident deaths.
[3:00:06.120 --> 3:00:10.720]  Varying in mind, of course, as we know, these COVID deaths are grossly over exaggerated.
[3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:15.440]  I've spoken about this before and it's crucial and it got very little attention at the time.
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:20.520]  And this ties into everything that I'm going to talk about. Somebody did a freedom of information
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:26.320]  act request to the UK government, which by law they're mandated to respond to. This was
[3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:31.160]  but a few months ago now and they asked the question, very simple, direct question, how
[3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:36.160]  many COVID deaths that have been registered, total COVID deaths that have been announced,
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:43.680]  were caused by COVID alone and not by all these comorbidities thrown into the equation.
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:49.760]  This was on the government website, gov.uk, and the answer they came back with was it
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:55.320]  boiled down to one tenth of the total amount of COVID deaths that they had announced to
[3:00:55.320 --> 3:01:03.480]  the nation had been as a result of COVID. Only one tenth were as a result of COVID alone.
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:08.360]  Then you look at all these, all these, I say, cases of young people dying of COVID. Of course,
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:13.760]  you get one in a blue moon of someone, for example, in their 20s or early 30s dying of
[3:01:13.760 --> 3:01:19.440]  COVID. They trumpet that in the media like it's some ominous event, like it's a regular
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:24.560]  thing, a routine occurrence, turns out most of these people who die from COVID, obviously
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:30.600]  there are unfortunate incidents where healthy young people die, but it's infinitesimal.
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:35.880]  The vast majority of prominent cases you see are morbidly obese people because they're,
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:42.240]  of course, more prone to die. But the actual figure is one tenth of the amount that they've
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:48.560]  announced to the nation have died of COVID alone. And again, as I said, as of yesterday,
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:55.040]  more people on Monday died of COVID. Now, bear in mind this is the official figure based
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:02:01.560]  on the previous 28 days of reporting. And we know that these reports, these tests are
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:07.520]  notoriously inaccurate. These death statistics are notoriously inaccurate, not by means of
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:11.760]  conspiracy theorists claiming that it's all fake and it doesn't exist, but by the government's
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:18.040]  own numbers on their own official government website in response to a freedom of information
[3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:24.880]  act request. So we asked the question, we had four deaths yesterday from COVID, more
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:30.800]  people on average die of traffic accidents every day in the UK. And yet we're still in
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:39.240]  a state of semi-lockdown and we will be for the next two months at least. They promised
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:43.240]  us, just like they promised us there'd be no vaccine passports, which they're now rolling
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:48.520]  out, funding, experimenting with. I'm going to get into that later as well. They promised
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:54.160]  us that wouldn't happen. They promised us that all social distancing mask wearing restrictions
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:03:01.520]  would be lifted on June 21st. And yet they're planning mass public events, sports events,
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:09.120]  music events, major venues with half quarter capacity and all these social distancing restrictions
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:16.920]  still in place. So the timeline is complete BS, even as it stands with only four people
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:23.040]  dying of COVID yesterday, they've got this timetable and they refuse to accelerate it
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:30.600]  despite the fact that over 813,000 people in the United Kingdom have lost their jobs
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:34.400]  over the past year. And they say, oh, that's because of the pandemic. It's not because
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:40.600]  of the pandemic. It's because of the lockdown. And again, they say we're going to we're going
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:46.800]  to lead by data, not dates. Okay, the data is grossly vastly in your favor in terms of
[3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:54.600]  record low cases, record low deaths. So let's lead by the data. Oh, no, we can't do that.
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:58.360]  And they're not going to lift these restrictions. That's the point. If people don't continue
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:04:03.320]  to resist, they're going to give us a couple of months off, a few months off, then they're
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:10.440]  going to be some scary new variants. And oh, we need to lock down again. That's the plan.
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:17.160]  In fact, I was told last year in July, when we had these restrictions lifted, we had a
[3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:21.920]  July the fourth, big unlocking and everybody was out on the street partying, everybody
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:27.600]  was having house parties, everybody was saying, Oh, thank God, it's over. It's all over. Even
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:33.320]  then, when COVID cases and COVID deaths were lower than they are now, or around the same
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:39.440]  level at least, I was told that they would reintroduce lockdown measures in October for
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:44.000]  the same year 2020. And that's exactly what they did. They introduced them in terms of
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:49.680]  tears, absolutely built up all these different areas of the country were elevated into stricter
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:55.680]  and stricter tears. And then of course, they gave us two days off over Christmas. Soon as
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:05:02.880]  January came into effect, the lockdown came into full force once again. So because they're
[3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:07.160]  going to give us two or three months off and because we're going to think, Oh, finally,
[3:05:07.160 --> 3:05:11.280]  we've won the battle. This is all over. The battle is not over. We've heard public health
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:16.560]  officials, bureaucrats, government clongos come out and say, this is going to be two,
[3:05:16.560 --> 3:05:21.280]  three years, some have said five, 10 years. If people don't stop resisting, they're going
[3:05:21.280 --> 3:05:28.280]  to continue to relent and to indoctrinate us with this belief that, Oh, my God, the government's
[3:05:28.280 --> 3:05:35.880]  allowing us to go to the pub. Let's all take pub selfies at pub. No, that's normal behavior.
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:40.320]  That's not something to be celebrated. Now, I'm not saying don't go to the pub for somebody's
[3:05:40.320 --> 3:05:44.840]  birthday party and don't celebrate their birthday party. Do that because that's what they don't
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:50.400]  want you to do. But don't celebrate the mere fact that the government has given you permission
[3:05:50.400 --> 3:05:58.640]  to engage in normal leisure activity. Don't set the precedent that that right, that privilege
[3:05:58.640 --> 3:06:03.880]  comes from the state it doesn't, which is why all these people taking pub selfies are really
[3:06:03.880 --> 3:06:08.840]  playing into the government's hands. The good news is though, and there's a lot of good
[3:06:08.840 --> 3:06:15.400]  news on this front on a day-to-day basis, the resistance is growing. Headline out of
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:23.120]  Summit.News, UK Labour leader kicked out of pub by anti-lockdown landlord. Now, of course,
[3:06:23.120 --> 3:06:27.400]  as you know, the political system in the United Kingdom at this point is basically a two-party
[3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:33.680]  system as you have in America. You have the Labour Party, the traditional left-wing party,
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:39.640]  which just like the Democrats has been completely subsumed, buried by identity politics, then
[3:06:39.640 --> 3:06:46.360]  you have the Conservative Party, which is Conservative in name only. For the past year-plus,
[3:06:46.360 --> 3:06:53.520]  the so-called opposition, the Labour Party, has supported every single lockdown measure
[3:06:53.520 --> 3:07:00.040]  pushed by the so-called Conservative government. Now, a lot of those measures weren't even
[3:07:00.040 --> 3:07:05.800]  voted on in Parliament, but when they were, the Labour Party not only supported the Conservative
[3:07:05.800 --> 3:07:12.560]  government, but called for even more stringent, even more authoritarian measures. That finally
[3:07:12.560 --> 3:07:16.560]  popped off in terms of confrontations, and we're going to get into this after the break
[3:07:16.560 --> 3:07:22.720]  because we've only got about a minute and a half. There was a big confrontation in Bath,
[3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:28.680]  which is a city, I guess, about an hour and a half from London on the train, where a pub
[3:07:28.680 --> 3:07:35.840]  landlord confronted the opposition Labour leader. This went absolutely viral. This last
[3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:40.640]  time I saw it had about a million views on Twitter alone. Finally, somebody speaking
[3:07:40.640 --> 3:07:47.200]  truth to power, the truth buried by the monopoly mainstream media narrative, which hasn't even
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:54.920]  entertained the disgraceful, the overbearing, the ominous impact of lockdown, not just in
[3:07:54.920 --> 3:08:00.040]  terms of the economy, which of course we know leads to poverty, poverty leads to death, but
[3:08:00.040 --> 3:08:06.120]  in terms of social ostracisation, atomisation of families not being able to see each other,
[3:08:06.120 --> 3:08:10.360]  and of course, untreated cancer, all these other untreated illnesses that people are
[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:16.960]  now dying of, not because of the pandemic, but because of lockdown. Now we're finally
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:23.000]  starting to see prominent examples of people resisting, not just in the United Kingdom,
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:27.600]  but in other countries. And after the break, when we get back, I'm going to explain why
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:33.560]  specifically there's a war on the pub in the United Kingdom, what the pub represents in
[3:08:33.560 --> 3:08:39.480]  terms of our culture, and why the government is still waging this war on pubs, even as
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:45.160]  it opens up non-essential retail, all these transnational corporations, we'll be back
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:55.600]  don't go away. It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:09:01.560]  by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builderburg, but their objective is
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:07.760]  the world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:13.560]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:18.520]  at hand. The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their
[3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:22.560]  plan to figure the world. It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in-game blueprint

[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:30.960]  And we are back. It is the second segment of the Summit News Hour. Now over the past
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:37.360]  year or so, we've had big scaremongering narratives pushed by the monopoly media, the legacy media.
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:43.800]  The coronavirus pandemic, the way the infection is spreading is via people gathering in huge
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:50.680]  numbers in pubs on the streets when they're drinking and on beaches. Then when I actually
[3:11:50.680 --> 3:11:55.000]  did the studies into how this virus was spreading, this is the same in America. It's the same
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:59.520]  in any other developed nation. It was spreading through hospitals while all the nurses were
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:05.560]  doing TikTok dances. And it was spreading through care homes. When you boil down the
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:12.200]  numbers over the past 12 months or so, only 3% of coronavirus infections spread via the
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:18.280]  hospitality industry, that is pubs, bars, restaurants. And in fact, I think the number
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:23.800]  is even lower on beaches. In fact, one of the safest places to be in terms of people
[3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:29.520]  not spreading coronavirus but still being able to enjoy vaunted leisure time with permission
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:35.600]  from the government is by being on the beach. Yet we had dozens and dozens of scare stories
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:40.000]  in the mainstream media over the past 12 months of videos, photographs of people enjoying
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:45.400]  themselves on the beach. And then these hectoring witch hunt mobs on Twitter pointing to those
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:50.480]  images and saying, oh my God, this is going to cause the third wave, the fourth wave.
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:57.360]  It was complete BS. The beaches are the safest place to be. And a close second place is the
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:04.200]  pubs. Now you ask yourself, aside from the internet, aside from social media, where is
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:10.520]  popular opinion, where is popular and in fact populist sentiment formed, especially in the
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:18.520]  United Kingdom with that much heralded drinking culture? It's primarily two of the prior locations
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:26.520]  in terms of IRL, I would argue would be the hairdressers, the barbers, and in pubs. Now
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:31.320]  every time I've been into a pub, when lockdowns be on and off every time I've been into the
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:37.320]  barbers, what are people talking about? They're talking about how lockdown, how this relentless
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:44.120]  fear mongering monopoly media propaganda narrative about coronavirus, about the vaunted efficacy
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:53.000]  of lockdown is complete BS. So where does the government focus its most stringent draconian
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:14:01.360]  restrictive measures? It's on places like barbers, hairdressers, and pubs. Again, 3% of infections
[3:14:01.360 --> 3:14:07.800]  came from pubs. And yet now we have a situation where for the next month at least, you cannot
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:14.960]  go inside a pub. Oh, but the retailers, the big box transnational corporations, the likes
[3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:21.240]  of Primark clothing store, which is basically the Wal-Mart of clothing in the United Kingdom,
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:30.480]  they're fully open. In fact, we had a story about this the other day from Summit News,
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:35.760]  where rabid consumers crush into massive Harrods queue after being locked down for months.
[3:14:35.760 --> 3:14:41.480]  And we have the pictures, we have the video in this news article, hundreds of people crammed
[3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:47.200]  into close proximity with queues, and they've sell barriers to ensure these queues snake
[3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:54.600]  round and round and round, so people can get into Harrods, so people can get into Primark,
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:15:01.040]  the Wal-Mart of clothing stores. That's fine. That's acceptable for the next month at least.
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:08.000]  And yet still, you can't go into a pub. People going to scramble for clothing deals in Primark
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:13.400]  or luxury items in Harrods and not stopping and having conversations with other people
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:19.480]  with strangers about the nature of the coronavirus lockdown or the pandemic itself, where they
[3:15:19.480 --> 3:15:25.000]  are having those conversations or where they would have those conversations is in the barbers,
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:34.280]  is in the pubs, and they've been the hardest hit. We still can't go inside a pub. And this
[3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:37.360]  is why. I'm going to talk about that in a minute, but first we're going to go to these
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:44.040]  videos because I mentioned it before the break. The first viral instance of a pub landlord
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:50.920]  confronting a politician, a leader of an opposition party, somebody who is supposed to act as
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:57.520]  a bulwark against the government, the Conservative government, yet his party, the Labour Party,
[3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:03.520]  has acted as a rubber stamp, as a green light at every single major juncture for the past
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:09.240]  year in not only voting with the government, in not only advocating all the Conservative
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:15.760]  opposition party's policies, but in fact demanding more stringent policies. And finally, a pub
[3:16:15.760 --> 3:16:23.960]  landlord, and by the way, last week I talked about it, we had 60 plus landlords, organisers,
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:29.160]  owners of pub chains come out and say that the vaccine passport is not going to work,
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:32.680]  it's going to be impossible to enforce, it's going to drive away business, it's going to
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:39.280]  put more pubs out of business, hundreds of which close in the UK on a monthly basis.
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:45.680]  Finally we had this viral confrontation between a pub landlord in Bath in the United Kingdom
[3:16:45.680 --> 3:16:50.720]  and the leader of the fake opposition party, which acts as a rubber stamp for everything
[3:16:50.720 --> 3:16:57.320]  the government does, and it was refreshing to say the least. We've got a clip of this,
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:17:04.200]  the initial confrontation will play between the pub landlord in Bath and the UK Labour
[3:17:04.200 --> 3:17:17.720]  party leader Keir Starmer, let's go to this clip right now.
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:35.680]  Do you know what the average age of death we've coded is? 82 years and 3 months. The average
[3:17:35.680 --> 3:17:36.680]  age of death normally? 81 years. Do you understand that we have a thorough economy because old
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:44.560]  people are dying? Do you see this graph? The last line we had this much death was 2008,
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:52.200]  the British Medical Journal. I came here to speak to this man, not your security. You
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:57.800]  have failed me. We, I've been a Labour voter my entire life, you have failed to be the
[3:17:57.800 --> 3:18:05.560]  opposition, you have failed to ask where the lockdown was functioning. Thousands of people
[3:18:05.560 --> 3:18:11.400]  have died because you have failed to do your job and ask the real questions. Well I am
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:17.280]  telling you now, and I hope this goes out, you have failed this country. You have seriously
[3:18:17.280 --> 3:18:23.320]  failed. You have allowed our children to wear masks in school when it's never been any evidence
[3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:34.320]  for it. Do you want to come on in here a moment?
[3:18:34.320 --> 3:18:53.240]  So there's the pub landlord in Bath confronting the Labour leader and if you want to play the
[3:18:53.240 --> 3:18:58.720]  second video as I speak over it, which is this same Labour leader then trying to enter
[3:18:58.720 --> 3:19:05.400]  the pub owned by that same person who just confronted him being harassed, being aggressively
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:09.800]  manhandled by security and if you didn't hear what the landlord was saying, he was saying
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:14.320]  the average age of the COVID death was 82 years and three months compared to the average
[3:19:14.320 --> 3:19:21.200]  age of death in the UK, which is 81 years, making the point that this almost exclusively
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:25.880]  was killing off older people while the rest of the country was put under de facto house
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:31.800]  arrest. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, responded by tweeting some terse, smarmy response saying
[3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:37.800]  go register to vote. Why? To vote for the same party, the so-called opposition party
[3:19:37.800 --> 3:19:44.480]  that support the ruling government at every turn of the table. Ridiculous. No way, we'll
[3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:45.480]  be right back.
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:50.440]  You know, listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:50.440 --> 3:19:56.160]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:19:56.160 --> 3:20:00.960]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together. And you know, it gets old having
[3:20:00.960 --> 3:20:04.680]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air. But
[3:20:04.680 --> 3:20:08.080]  it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:20:08.080 --> 3:20:12.720]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and
[3:20:12.720 --> 3:20:16.440]  almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups, and we're still here
[3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:21.200]  and as this whole new world order comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:21.200 --> 3:20:24.840]  That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:24.840 --> 3:20:29.600]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free. You can't have
[3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:33.880]  info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:33.880 --> 3:20:38.240]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an info
[3:20:38.240 --> 3:20:42.640]  war store dot com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're
[3:20:42.640 --> 3:20:46.200]  wonderful products and they support the info war. Thank you.
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:55.240]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:20:59.960]  before I had access to a show in the mid-90s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought, man,
[3:20:59.960 --> 3:21:04.880]  that was fun. In fact, speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd,
[3:21:04.880 --> 3:21:08.960]  you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:15.000]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:19.040]  feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real. But I'm trying to
[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:22.440]  tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right. And most of the time we do. The globalists
[3:21:22.440 --> 3:21:28.560]  love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity. They enjoy
[3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:34.440]  manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really such a
[3:21:34.440 --> 3:21:39.760]  disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we will
[3:21:39.760 --> 3:21:44.240]  never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all
[3:21:44.240 --> 3:21:50.080]  in this together. I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:53.680]  as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, all the terrible things that are
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:59.520]  unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public
[3:21:59.520 --> 3:22:03.760]  figure. So I get to see things that are public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:09.440]  it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:15.240]  media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment. They don't want
[3:22:15.240 --> 3:22:19.920]  to go on with the globalist, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well, that's
[3:22:19.920 --> 3:22:24.800]  where info wars comes in. You fund us. You support info wars.com. You get great policy
[3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:29.880]  at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, but
[3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:34.440]  the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:40.800]  detect heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:46.280]  we can be the shock groups for the information war. Fund us at info wars store.com. It is
[3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:56.560]  a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful world
[3:22:56.560 --> 3:23:03.800]  economy. It's known as the builder bird. Could their objective be world domination? For thousands
[3:23:03.800 --> 3:23:09.520]  of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their
[3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:16.320]  great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. The globalist fear this film made
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:20.120]  14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world. It is the blueprint
[3:23:20.120 --> 3:23:24.440]  for the great reset. It is in game blueprint for global enslavement available right now
[3:23:24.440 --> 3:23:28.560]  at info wars store.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere
[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:33.960]  in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in game at info wars store.com. I strongly
[3:23:33.960 --> 3:23:38.080]  suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand you tell
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:41.840]  others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well. That will trigger
[3:23:41.840 --> 3:23:48.680]  distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[3:23:48.680 --> 3:24:05.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from London, England. It's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:15.400]  with summit.news and we are back and you saw the video viral video that's now got millions
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:21.640]  of views of the pub landlord in the UK confronting the fake opposition leader Kia Stammer about
[3:24:21.640 --> 3:24:27.480]  his relentless support for lockdown policies pushed by the ruling conservative government.
[3:24:27.480 --> 3:24:33.280]  Finally somebody speaking truth to power and they tried to spin it as saying he was aggressive.
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:40.080]  He said the F word. Oh my God, the horror. Who cares? Who cares? That went viral and that's
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:45.960]  going to have a big impact going forward. And that's why they're targeting the pubs.
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:50.120]  That's why they're targeting the pubs in the sense of the retailers are all open. They
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:57.040]  have massive cues of hundreds of people snaking around Primark stores outside London. That's
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:02.800]  okay. That's fine. That's not a pandemic risk. But the pubs we have to keep the pubs shut
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:07.960]  down and why is that? Well, there's a very interesting article that was published today
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:14.520]  on lockdownskeptics.org which I summarized on summit.news and this headline teacher war
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:21.920]  on pubs is about silencing dissent. And this is by a writer and a university teacher called
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:28.520]  Sean Walsh and he perfectly encapsulated why they're still targeting the pubs while they're
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:33.920]  still not allowing people inside the pubs for the next month at least. And by the way,
[3:25:33.920 --> 3:25:39.440]  if you go to a pub in the UK, you have to give your name, you have to give your phone
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:43.920]  number, you have to give your address, you have to hand over your whole details to this
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:49.200]  new system that they're creating, which as we've highlighted in the past, is intended
[3:25:49.200 --> 3:25:55.080]  to be rolled into a Chinese communist style social credit score for the West. So why are
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:59.120]  they targeting the pubs? Well, a university teacher has published a fascinating article
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:06.800]  in which he argues that the shutdown of pubs in the UK is about silencing dissent. Sean
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:11.680]  Walsh questions why pubs are still semi-closed while other quote non-essential retail stores
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:17.960]  are allowed to fully open. Despite the fact that the entire hospitality industry was responsible
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:26.160]  for just 3% of total COVID infections last year across the entire pandemic. The main
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:32.600]  bulk was in hospitals, it was in care homes, but no, they have to go after the pubs. He
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:37.880]  writes, quote, it's tempting to conclude that the sage, and that's the bureaucratic
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:42.240]  health body that advises the government on lockdowns in this country, are not worried
[3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:47.640]  that pubs are possible vectors of transmission, but that they are concerned that hospitality
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:53.920]  venues are potential theaters of dissent. And this is the point I was making before
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:27:00.400]  the break. That is where popular sentiment is formed outside of social media in the real
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:07.040]  world. In this country, at least, it's in the pubs. That's the forum where people congregate
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:13.280]  to swap stories, to swap anecdotes, to form the basis, the foundation of public opinion
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:19.560]  that drives popular sentiment in this country. He also notes that health bureaucrats seem
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:25.840]  to be intent on the British public remaining joyless as part of some demented, puritanical
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:33.560]  drive to oversee, quote, the crude sanitization of our understanding of the human soul. Now
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:38.760]  he makes the point that pubs are not just a place of fun and frivolity, but an organizing
[3:27:38.760 --> 3:27:44.120]  forum where popular sentiment takes shape. He says, quote, it's in the pub that people
[3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:49.680]  can whisper conspiracy against the government narrative, and conspiracies are always required
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:55.120]  that the like-minded are allowed together. It is over a drink that the millionaires and
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:28:01.120]  the pauper can come together and compare notes. And then he moves on to talk about the social
[3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:08.040]  credit score aspect of this war on pubs. Quote, Boris Johnson is currently offering
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:14.360]  us a sinister inversion of what a pub is, one in which you are tracked, traced, audited,
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:19.600]  judged, and humiliated. The roadmap in this industry, at least, is one that leads you
[3:28:19.600 --> 3:28:27.600]  not into normal, but into a Twin Peaks version of it. And that's the entire point. Even to
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:35.560]  go to a pub at this moment, you have to capitulate, you have to submit to the prototype, the embryonic
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:41.720]  social credit score system by handing over all your information. Now, of course, lots
[3:28:41.720 --> 3:28:45.800]  of people are just going to give them fake names and fake numbers, and they should do
[3:28:45.800 --> 3:28:51.400]  because they should resist this at every turn available, but lots of people aren't. They're
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:56.520]  just going to say, well, what's the phone number? What's the name? What's a mask? As
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:29:01.840]  long as I can sit outside and enjoy a pint, and then it becomes permanent, and then it
[3:29:01.840 --> 3:29:09.120]  advances into every other area of life, it reverses the entire tradition of common law
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:17.160]  that our country is based on, whereby you're allowed to engage in any behavior, any activity,
[3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:22.680]  unless it's expressively forbidden by law. Now, that's completely reversed, and now we
[3:29:22.680 --> 3:29:28.280]  have to have government permission to engage in the most normal, basic, routine, leisure
[3:29:28.280 --> 3:29:34.000]  behavior. That's a complete 180 reversal of common law understanding that this country
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:41.160]  has operated under as its foundation for what? Over a thousand years now. He continues by
[3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:45.760]  arguing that if the government was trying to build a police state, one of the first
[3:29:45.760 --> 3:29:51.560]  things it would do is to, quote, stamp on the enjoyment of the gray unwashed and confiscate
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:57.560]  all mechanisms of dissent. Now, of course, if you know through social media, if you dissent
[3:29:57.560 --> 3:30:03.400]  on social media, if you talk about vaccine reactions, and not even that, if you merely
[3:30:03.400 --> 3:30:10.160]  criticize the lockdown, even if you cite medical peer-reviewed papers, experts who are criticizing
[3:30:10.160 --> 3:30:14.440]  the lockdown, that will get you banned on social media, but they can't ban you from
[3:30:14.440 --> 3:30:19.040]  talking about it in a pub, right? Oh, well, they can. If all the pubs are closed, then
[3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:24.920]  you can't talk to anyone in the first place. Walsh writes, quote, the government's war
[3:30:24.920 --> 3:30:31.760]  on pubs is ticking both those boxes. And as I pointed out before the break, the government
[3:30:31.760 --> 3:30:38.040]  is perfectly happy with having hundreds of people congregate in huge crowds outside transnational
[3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:43.120]  corporate retail stores. Apparently, that's not a vector for transmission. That's not
[3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:47.760]  going to spread the virus. But woe betide you go to a pub and meet your friends and talk
[3:30:47.760 --> 3:30:53.840]  about how much of a BS system the lockdown is, that apparently is the main threat. But
[3:30:53.840 --> 3:30:58.360]  now it's led to a confrontation. And hopefully there are many more confrontations and acts
[3:30:58.360 --> 3:31:05.200]  of resistance from hospitality managers, from restaurant owners, from pub landlords,
[3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:12.680]  as we saw in the video that we played in the previous segment. And this is related, a headline
[3:31:12.680 --> 3:31:18.440]  again out of Summit.News. UK still won't accelerate reopening despite COVID deaths dropping below
[3:31:18.440 --> 3:31:26.320]  road accident fatalities. I talked about that. COVID cases have dropped 94% from the peak
[3:31:26.320 --> 3:31:33.800]  that we had in this country. And again, yesterday, the UK recorded just four total deaths. The
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:37.960]  telegraph reports that in comparison, the UK records an average of around five deaths from
[3:31:37.960 --> 3:31:42.760]  road accidents daily. So now there are literally more people dying on average per day from
[3:31:42.760 --> 3:31:49.760]  road accidents than COVID. Yet we don't ban cars, we don't shut down roads, but we still,
[3:31:49.760 --> 3:31:57.120]  for no reason whatsoever, shut down pubs. They say they're going to go on the data,
[3:31:57.120 --> 3:32:01.800]  not the dates, and yet they're refusing to acknowledge the data and accelerate the program
[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:08.520]  of reopening. It's even worse in Australia, though, which had an even more draconian
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:16.200]  lockdown than basically every major developed nation in the world headline. Australia minister
[3:32:16.200 --> 3:32:22.800]  refuses to rule out electronic ankle bracelets to enforce home quarantine. Now this is a
[3:32:22.800 --> 3:32:28.960]  country that, and we had the article back last year, which literally as the government
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:35.280]  was announcing the lockdown, had police surround apartment blocks in Melbourne and in Sydney
[3:32:35.280 --> 3:32:40.800]  to ensure that people couldn't leave their own residential apartment blocks. That's how
[3:32:40.800 --> 3:32:46.400]  severe their lockdown was. We have multiple videos of police officers slamming people
[3:32:46.400 --> 3:32:52.400]  to the ground, slamming their heads to the ground if they failed to wear masks outside.
[3:32:52.400 --> 3:32:57.360]  While now a senior government minister in Australia has refused to rule out Australians
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:03.440]  being forced to wear electronic ankle bracelets, even if they're fully vaccinated, to make
[3:33:03.440 --> 3:33:08.200]  sure they're complying with home quarantine orders. Now the question was asked of the
[3:33:08.200 --> 3:33:12.680]  employment minister over there in Australia, Stuart Robert, by a journalist called David
[3:33:12.680 --> 3:33:17.600]  Spears. He said, quote, what sort of ideas would there be for this regular visits inspections
[3:33:17.600 --> 3:33:24.720]  to make sure they're home ankle bracelets, some sort of monitoring? How do you do it?
[3:33:24.720 --> 3:33:32.080]  So they're now literally talking about applying prisoner on patrol methods on parole methods
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:37.920]  to ensure people self quarantine at home in Australia if they come back into Australia
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:43.000]  as Australian citizens from another country. This is not ending anytime soon. Don't go
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:44.960]  away. We'll be right back.
[3:33:44.960 --> 3:33:50.000]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:55.800]  is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in
[3:33:55.800 --> 3:33:59.840]  the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the
[3:33:59.840 --> 3:34:05.960]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend,
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:12.040]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:17.120]  and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:22.120]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays Kava is used around the world by
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:27.720]  many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:33.960]  a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including but not limited to German Kama
[3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:39.960]  Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Valerian Root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:44.880]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[3:34:44.880 --> 3:34:48.000]  Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:54.600]  I would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:34:57.880]  According to warned people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay? I'm
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:35:04.480]  a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that will never go away. Living
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:10.280]  defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living
[3:35:10.280 --> 3:35:15.960]  defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus the same as to
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:21.920]  where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:29.160]  be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:34.720]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's
[3:35:34.720 --> 3:35:36.280]  right where we're at brother.
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:40.760]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:47.080]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:52.240]  Country has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:56.520]  to what you're told and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians, if
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:35:59.880]  you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training
[3:35:59.880 --> 3:36:04.240]  is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because
[3:36:04.240 --> 3:36:08.480]  the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:12.600]  they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the
[3:36:12.600 --> 3:36:18.240]  third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:23.160]  such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:28.840]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:33.440]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:39.440]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:45.280]  get more IMF and World Bank money. And that's why we have to really get educated about the
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:56.280]  globalist. It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:37:02.400]  powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Both their objectives be world
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:08.800]  domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:15.160]  the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[3:37:15.160 --> 3:37:19.200]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:23.160]  figure the world. It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in game blueprint for global

[3:37:49.720 --> 3:38:00.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:07.080]  You're listening to summit.news with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:38:07.080 --> 3:38:14.720]  Go back. It is the final segment and switch into some other news now. And this is a video
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:19.720]  that came out a couple of days ago. Headline up on summit.news. The LGBT movement continues
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:27.560]  to inflict its progressive wave across America. Headline disgusting video shows children being
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:35.880]  paraded around drag queen show taking cash tips. Another disgusting video is a measure
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:41.600]  of children being paraded around during a late night drag queen show in LA. Of course
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:47.880]  it's LA. As they are encouraged to take cash tips from members of the crowd. Now we saw
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:53.800]  this before with Desmond is amazing. And his mother actually came out afterwards and defended
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:39:01.240]  the fact that this 12 year old kid was literally in a gay club in New York at night taking
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:08.320]  cash tips from these monsters in the crowd. Well now it's happened again. The woman filming
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:13.360]  the video expresses a revolution at the scene commenting why in the hell do these people
[3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:24.360]  got these effing little B.A. kids at this effing drag show. It was 11 40 p.m. at night. These
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:31.080]  people have children in an effing drag show in LA. Well I would question why you're attending
[3:39:31.080 --> 3:39:36.240]  a drag show at midnight in the first place if it's so horrendous. But at least she got
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:40.360]  the video out and at least she opposed it. Maybe she was unaware that there was a drag
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:47.280]  show taking place. But as you can see the video shows two young blonde girls. I guess
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:51.680]  they're one of them's younger than the other. One of them's probably around six or seven.
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:57.800]  The other one's probably 10 I guess. Being made by a drag queen to perform poses to music
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:04.320]  as they collect money from the attendees. Now the point I make in the article is obviously
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:10.040]  this is completely effed up that you would have children at this disgusting parade of
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:17.800]  degeneracy in Los Angeles trash hell city in the first place. The responsibility solely
[3:40:17.800 --> 3:40:22.720]  rests on the organizers the owners of this venue. And of course with the parents who
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:30.400]  would allow their children to be put up on stage to engage in this disgusting ritual.
[3:40:30.400 --> 3:40:34.600]  But the point I make in the article who in the hell is sitting in the audience. What
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:39.720]  kind of creepy pervert and there are dozens of them in this video and we've had other
[3:40:39.720 --> 3:40:46.120]  videos in the past of similar scenes. What kind of creepy pervert would take dollar bills
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:53.360]  and offer them to six seven eight year old kids who are performing in a drag show 1140
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:41:00.200]  p.m. at night. This is the vaunted LGBT movement they're all supposed to grovel and genuflect
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:06.120]  to disgusting. And in the article I point out a few examples of where this happened
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:12.760]  in the past. And there are many. I chose like half of the examples I personally wrote about
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:19.880]  in the past two years. 2019 as I mentioned Desmond is amazing. Who literally appears
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:26.160]  with drag queens in videos where they've got artwork behind them which says row hypno on
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:32.440]  the artwork. They're talking about taking drugs in front of a 12 year old kid and he's
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:38.920]  up there laughing about it. They did it in 2019. Gay club in New York. Similar scene.
[3:41:38.920 --> 3:41:45.760]  12 year old boy posing degenerate creepy pervert sticking dollar bills or handing him dollar
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:53.040]  bills. We had another example posted to TikTok. Another completely trash website that's destroying
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:59.120]  the use of America on a daily basis. Which showed a drag queen dancing suggestively in
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:07.360]  front of a girl no older than six as adults in the room applauded and cheered. Again this
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:14.720]  is the same this is the same movement in many senses that rails against creepy men harassing
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:20.480]  and stalking women on the streets. And rightly so. That's the problem that exists. It's the
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:25.880]  same movement that does that and says that there needs to be a reckoning of toxic masculinity
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:30.200]  and we need to stop this rape culture of men harassing women on the streets and being perverts
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:36.880]  and being creeps while simultaneously exposing six seven eight year old girls to this very
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:42.960]  same perverted degenerate creep culture. Oh but it's okay because it's in the name of
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:51.200]  the LGBT movement. BS. It's all the same degenerate trash. We had another example as I said in
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:58.360]  the article. A high school in Brooklyn handed out stickers to four year old children bearing
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:03.600]  in mind now the sex education in the UK is plummeted to the age where five year old kids
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:09.920]  are being exposed to sex education. Disgusting. In Brooklyn they handed out stickers to four
[3:43:09.920 --> 3:43:17.760]  year old children during drag queen story time that said quote drag queen in training.
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:25.320]  Again drag queen story time where on numerous cases it's been exposed that literal pedo
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:31.720]  sex offenders are infiltrating themselves into these events. Oh what a surprise that
[3:43:31.720 --> 3:43:37.520]  pedo sex offenders would try to get around children in the name of progressivism and
[3:43:37.520 --> 3:43:45.480]  LGBT. They're literally handing out drag queen in training stickers in major American cities
[3:43:45.480 --> 3:43:51.760]  to four year old kids. That is nothing less than disgusting and satanic and it's the same
[3:43:51.760 --> 3:43:58.560]  people who say toxic masculinity. Creepy pervert men on the streets need to be stopped and
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:03.480]  they do. But you don't really have the moral high ground talking about creepy pervert men
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:10.440]  when you're parading your seven year old kids with drag queens making them take cash dollar
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:19.480]  tips from these degenerate freaks in the crowd at these kind of events. And as I point in
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:24.400]  the article there was actually a drag queen which I would question anyone who involves
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:27.960]  themselves in that lifestyle. Again we look at transgender people, we look at the rate
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:32.920]  of suicide, we look at the rate of drug use, we look at the rate of STDs which I've got
[3:44:32.920 --> 3:44:39.320]  another story about that. Why would you involve yourself in that lifestyle? But even he,
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:45.280]  Kitty DeMure, slammed woke parents for exposing their kids to drag queen culture. And I don't
[3:44:45.280 --> 3:44:51.440]  care what it is, you don't expose kids to any kind of sexualized culture whatsoever.
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:56.960]  But apparently as long as it's under the banner of LGBT then it's progressive, then it's fine
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:45:01.840]  and these same people will then on the other hand talk about toxic masculinity, talk about
[3:45:01.840 --> 3:45:07.280]  harassment, talk about misogyny, talk about creepy pervert men while at the same time
[3:45:07.280 --> 3:45:16.280]  they're literally engaged in this which I would argue was 100% worse. And on that subject,
[3:45:16.280 --> 3:45:23.960]  another nice cozy story here, STDs in America hit record high for 6th straight year, the
[3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:28.000]  numbers keep getting worse, America's sexually transmitted disease rates have hit a record
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:36.280]  high for the 6th straight year, with CDC researchers finding a 30% increase in STDs from 2015 to
[3:45:36.280 --> 3:45:44.880]  2019. So in a four year period alone they rose by 30%. 2.5 million Americans had either
[3:45:44.880 --> 3:45:50.480]  chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis infections in 2019, so progressive, with chlamydia cases
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:59.960]  rising 61% and gonorrhea cases spiking 42% among young people aged 15 to 24. Which again,
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:05.520]  they're bathed in this degenerate culture of having teenage girls parade themselves
[3:46:05.520 --> 3:46:11.280]  and shake their butts around on TikTok, the dopamine, the likes, the follows, creating
[3:46:11.280 --> 3:46:17.400]  only fans' accounts, TikTok is the gateway drug to only fans, that's fine, that's liberating,
[3:46:17.400 --> 3:46:22.600]  that's progressive, but all toxic masculinity is the problem. And again, just by coincidence
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:26.760]  those people in that same age bracket are more chronically depressed and suicidal than
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:32.760]  ever before, gee I wonder if there's a connection there. The research also shows that gay and
[3:46:32.760 --> 3:46:37.600]  bisexual men account for nearly half of the primary and secondary syphilis infections
[3:46:37.600 --> 3:46:46.800]  while syphilis infections among newborn babies quadrupled between 2015 and 2019. This is truly
[3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:53.560]  the Babylon system. Oh, but it's such a progressive, positive lifestyle. Yeah, it's positive in
[3:46:53.560 --> 3:46:59.240]  one way, perhaps not a good way. Black people at STD rates between five to eight times higher
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:05.040]  than white people, again this is CDC numbers, while amongst Hispanics the figure was double
[3:47:05.040 --> 3:47:10.640]  that of white people and then I quote a doctor who says that 20 years ago they had a handle
[3:47:10.640 --> 3:47:18.040]  on it, the STD rates were going down in America, now they're rising year upon year upon year.
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:24.200]  CDC study found that more than four out of ten women who identify as transgender and
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:31.600]  live in big cities have contracted HIV. Again, destructive demolishing lifestyle that they're
[3:47:31.600 --> 3:47:38.320]  being inducted into at an increasingly young age and it's all being promoted by the culture
[3:47:38.320 --> 3:47:43.960]  by the legacy media as something liberating while at the same time they have record high
[3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:50.000]  suicide rates, record high chronic depression. I would suggest that inducting yourself into
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:57.120]  a life of hedonistic degeneracy, which leads to literally half of them catching STDs, serious
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:01.960]  illnesses, maybe that's not a positive thing, maybe you should reject that kind of indoctrination,
[3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:06.920]  that kind of brainwashing. I conclude by saying the media in the culture's relentless promotion
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:14.200]  of degenerate promiscuity, again fueled by dating apps, only fans ticked off primarily,
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:20.640]  for straight and gay people and the rise of the LGBT movement obviously has nothing whatsoever
[3:48:20.640 --> 3:48:25.160]  to do with any of this and I'll leave you with that cozy story, but stay tuned because
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:31.720]  the George Floyd verdict is coming up soon within an hour, we've got Owen Shroyer with
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:45.360]  the Raw War Room ready to cover it as it unfolds live.
