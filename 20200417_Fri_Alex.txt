[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Music
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  You still think that Jeff will brought down the World Trade Center?
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.000]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  This story does not end up.
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is April 17th on this Friday Transmission and Info Wars is in attack formation.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  Despite all the globalist attacks, thanks to your prayers and your support and your word of mouth,
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  we're still here, stronger than ever, but bloodied.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  The enemy is moving on the surface and beneath the surface against every free nation on Earth.
[01:01.000 --> 01:11.000]  There have been draconian developments, undreamed of just six months ago, that have unfolded.
[01:11.000 --> 01:19.000]  Twitter, Facebook and Google are now announcing that they're even going to block members of the Congress
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  when they say that the coronavirus came out of the Wuhan lab.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  They are openly announcing that. I've got all the articles right here.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  They're announcing they're going to restrict or ban anyone that says the WHO covered it up
[01:37.000 --> 01:48.000]  or that China covered it up as the documents are released to the Associated Press confirming everything we told you ten weeks ago.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'll be laying all this out next segment.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  They're running national news pieces in Europe, the UK, Australia and Canada telling children,
[01:59.000 --> 02:11.000]  do not trust your parents, watch them carefully and report them if they say China is behind the virus.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  The fact checking group that runs it is run out of Wuhan at the Bioweapons Lab.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[02:22.000 --> 02:31.000]  The fact checker that runs the science group for Facebook that is then used by the other sites works at the level for Bioweapon Lab
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  and is number two in command.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  The Bioweapon Lab decides what Americans and Canadians and Germans and Mexicans and Brazilians can say
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  and sets the AI to watch you and control you.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  Welcome to the new world order.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  CDC instructs kids on how to shut down their parents.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  That's a quote.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  It says, does your dad say it came from the Wuhan lab?
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  Shut him down.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  But it gets worse in Australia.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  I saw an article where they're saying report them.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  In fact, that'll be done by next week in Canada.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  They say here it's dangerous as the virus.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  When your daddy, it says your daddy's the bad one.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  Of course, if we're going to have drones watching us and checkpoints and stay at home, lock down house arrest orders.
[03:32.000 --> 03:42.000]  Of course, they're going to tell the children, watch your parents because you see 1984 for these guys is a owner's manual.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  It's an operations plan.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  That's why Hillary Clinton said famously in the mid 90s when she was co-president.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  She said, my favorite books in 1984.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  I see it as a manual.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  People said, what does she mean by that?
[04:00.000 --> 04:16.000]  Well, she's called, hike on her skirt and urinating directly into your face.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  Yeah, let's put that article back up on screen for folks.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  Very, very, very interesting.
[04:24.000 --> 04:36.000]  Hillary Clinton's lessons of George R. Wells 1984 is to trust leaders, the press and experts.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  They're coming for you.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  They're coming for all of us.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  But you know, the fun part about it is we were waiting for them and we were laying out the resistance.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  So we're not going to be caught flat footed.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  The war has already begun.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  You're all players in it.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  We're all of this together.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.000]  We believe in families.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  We believe in capitalism, America and Jesus Christ, number one.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  And we believe in free speech.
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.000]  And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  They thought they'd want, but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[05:54.000 --> 06:19.000]  God bless you all.
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  When they strike me down, it will be a victory.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:42.000]  I want nothing more than humanity to feed this AI, 5G, positronic genetic engineer warfare takeover.
[06:42.000 --> 06:49.000]  If we don't succeed, not one child will have a future.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  The extermination has begun.
[06:54.000 --> 07:05.000]  The incremental ambient background noise of the electromagnetic radiation is being jacked up on high.
[07:05.000 --> 07:13.000]  All over the world, people are watching 5G go in by their house and the trees die within weeks.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  The grass begins to gnarling brown.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  The birds move their nest.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  And the studies are coming out everywhere.
[07:25.000 --> 07:35.000]  That the 5G towers are 3, 4, 5, 10 times stronger than even the FCC says they're allowed to have.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  And at the FCC agreed level, massive increases in cancer.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  Oh, you're burning inside now.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  The microwaves are rubbing your molecules together.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  And you're burning inside.
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.000]  Soon, you will die.
[07:56.000 --> 08:08.000]  And the globalists think you're so stupid that when you're all dying, you won't even notice it.
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  You ready to die? Hope so, because you're dying right now.
[08:15.000 --> 08:23.000]  Let's lay it out, ladies and gentlemen. All over the place, people are putting up time-lapse footage and photos of it going in and the trees dying.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  And it's in the studies they do that with the older systems that weren't as strong.
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  They're pouring in from Maryland and Texas and California.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  People that didn't even believe it openly see it.
[08:41.000 --> 08:48.000]  The microwave, and it's strong.
[08:48.000 --> 08:59.000]  And hey, but while you're dying, slowly, while your chest is all tight, because it pushes oxygen out of your lungs, in the studies.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  That's why it's been banned in Switzerland.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  It pushes the trace gas oxygen out of your lungs.
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  Look it up. Look up 5G studies and oxygen.
[09:12.000 --> 09:28.000]  By the way, we had Dr. Groupon in 2018 on my show on Owen's War Room, laying it all out in the specifics.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  And then it lowers your immunity so that viruses, period, are able to enter the cells.
[09:36.000 --> 09:49.000]  The resonance of 5Gs perfectly tuned to push viruses over the cell barrier and to give them penetration.
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  See, they don't want you to know the things that coat the cells that are naturally occurring that block viruses going through and replicating.
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  The system, the corporate media is doing everything it can publicly to block people learning about vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C, zinc.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  They tell the president, shut up when he talks about it.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  And then medical doctors go on local news and say, no, it's incredible. It's absolutely vital.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  It's on the NIH website that you die without zinc.
[10:18.000 --> 10:29.000]  And the feds are impaneling grand juries to arrest people that say zinc is important.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  That is the level of the evil that this country faces and the world.
[10:38.000 --> 10:52.000]  And the World Health Organization, the Associated Press reported two days ago, knew the virus came from the Wuhan lab, knew it was weaponized,
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  knew it was spreading and they covered it up and then told Trump, don't block flights from China, you're a xenophobe.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  That's the Associated Press.
[11:03.000 --> 11:14.000]  But Facebook has announced AP will not be allowed to be shared on its platform and anyone sharing the article will be banned.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  I'm going to show you those articles here in a moment.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[11:20.000 --> 11:29.000]  They told you 10 weeks ago when we told you it came from Wuhan from the bio weapons lab that we were evil and thank God we're blocked so many places.
[11:29.000 --> 11:37.000]  And that I need to be arrested for putting out disinformation and fear.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  But we knew from the author of the bio weapons law and from scientists, prestigious universities, and now it's on infowars.com.
[11:47.000 --> 12:01.000]  Nobel Prize winning scientist that discovered HIV has gone public saying he has looked at the data it is 100% chimera man made no lab.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  But you don't listen to the Nobel Prize winner.
[12:06.000 --> 12:18.000]  Stories on infowars.com and you don't share it on Facebook or Twitter you dirty scum Americans, because the Communist Chinese run America now and run the media and own Hollywood.
[12:18.000 --> 12:27.000]  And it's on record that their people have control and the Chinese Communist are the moderators on Twitter and former Stasi are the moderators on Facebook.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  But wait, it's better.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  It's better.
[12:32.000 --> 12:55.000]  Guess who runs Facebook's science division runs it and decides what you can say about zinc vitamin D hydroxychloroquine who says on Facebook that the president's a liar and there's no hope only Bill Gates can save you.
[12:55.000 --> 13:02.000]  One of the top scientists at the Wu Han bio weapons lab.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Wow.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  You can't make this up.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  They've hired Stasi.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  They've hired chai comms they run it and now.
[13:14.000 --> 13:28.000]  Dr Daniel Anderson one of the top scientists at the Wu Han lab with US Bill Gates funding says AP is bad.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  Does it matter if a whistleblower release the documents.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  No, no, no dirty Americans.
[13:36.000 --> 13:55.000]  You keep your filthy mouth shut and you stay in your house with the 5g towers going in and you wait for Bill Gates coming with his forced shot you will take it to you understand filthy scum.
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.000]  You know Stasi are folks they're the East German police that were worse than the KGB and in KVD.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  They've hired over 10,000 of them to run Facebook.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  We first reported on it six years ago when it started.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  By the way, I remember seeing that Marcus Wolf the former head of the Stasi was hired by the Democrats as a consultant to Homeland Security.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  He was the head of it.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  I remember hearing that didn't believe it.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  It turned out it was true.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  He's paid a million dollars a year to set this up.
[14:28.000 --> 14:45.000]  And now one of the top scientists at the bio weapons lab runs Facebook science check and tells you what science is and what science isn't and AP is lying.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  She works at the lab, not a conflict of interest.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  But don't worry when we come back.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  All over the world, they're saying report your parents.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  They're telling people in their little daily videos that are sent to them.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  This CBC thing is sent to the kids at home and CNN is sent for 10 minutes every day for public school kids all over the country.
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  CNN is the first 10 minutes they watch and it's telling them to watch mommy, watch daddy.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  I'm going to show you the video.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  You're like, how did we wake up in 1984?
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  It's how wars operate.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  They build up, they build up, they build up and then finally they emerge and you're hit by the megaton blast.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  This is I told you in the video titled this is why they banned Alex Jones that's been out for almost two years.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  And I explained they're coming with the mega blast vaccine in the video.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  They're going to hit you out of China with a bio weapon.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  And here we are totally laying it out because of our human intelligence.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  We're going to override this.
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.000]  I feel my intellect and spirit super charging because the main enemy attacks coming in for every action.
[15:54.000 --> 16:20.000]  There's an opposite and equal reaction and you are God's response.

[17:09.000 --> 17:10.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  That's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.000]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse.
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  We thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now.

[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  Except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest and more preposition.
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up.
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  Well now they're caught back up.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  They've got high quality storeable food in stock.

[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  How do you put them under siege?
[19:02.000 --> 19:10.000]  Well you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release.
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  To then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Man I hope we have a depression.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  Now they've tailored the whole thing.
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.000]  Where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states.
[19:29.000 --> 19:35.000]  All the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  If America is that stupid we deserve what happens to us.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  But as for me I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  But that's not what they're doing.
[19:48.000 --> 20:01.000]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:09.000 --> 20:21.000]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas U.S. resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China ally with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  The Communist Chinese are taking control of Hollywood.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  The Communist Chinese are taking control of the main universities.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  This is all confirmed.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  This is not a drill.
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[20:36.000 --> 20:45.000]  They've officially become state run Apple 100% Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man a demonized version of Alex Jones to do that.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  This is happening.
[20:51.000 --> 20:59.000]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt the censorship by just putting up with it.
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  This is a tight traded dose.
[21:07.000 --> 21:14.000]  Reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  In layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[21:21.000 --> 21:32.000]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.000]  This is a total internet of things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[21:37.000 --> 21:53.000]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai com slash big tech banking combine emergency situation.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[21:59.000 --> 22:08.000]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children.
[22:18.000 --> 22:26.000]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[22:26.000 --> 22:33.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.000]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  I have given you the transmission now break free.
[22:48.000 --> 23:00.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[23:00.000 --> 23:08.000]  Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[23:08.000 --> 23:17.000]  Over the mountain, we're going over.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  We're not going to just creep around and kill the babies silently and give you cancer slowly anymore.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  Now they're coming.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  Total economic collapse, war, disease, all the games are over.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  Playtime's gone.
[23:32.000 --> 23:41.000]  Honeymoon is a thing of the past and that's a good thing because now people will be forced to choose a side.
[23:41.000 --> 23:52.000]  Satan and a little bit of temporary power and an eternity have been cut off from God or rising to the occasion and standing against evil
[23:52.000 --> 24:02.000]  and finally really living in the mis clears and God's right there and you're like, how did I ever not understand this?
[24:02.000 --> 24:12.000]  How do they serve Satan when they don't even imagine the power of God and it's because they are cut off?
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  I'm totally ready to lay it all out.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  I'm ready to lay it out to the president.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  I'm ready to lay it out to the American people, to the people of the planet, to the Pentagon, everybody about the choices we all have to make right now.
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  And I know it's time for you, all of you watching and listening to lay it out as well, to your husband, your wife, your neighbors, your church,
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  to the person that screams at you at a gas station because you're not wearing a stupid mask.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  When most of the counties in the United States don't have one damn case of this weaponized cold, I'm going to lay it out next segment.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  And I started to get into this.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  This morning, again, I got up at 5am, went down, got some coffee, cooked some eggs.
[24:58.000 --> 25:10.000]  I went on the back porch with a little surveillance tablet and I was just pulling up the news and it was just over the top insane.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  All over the world saying, watch your parents, what are they saying about COVID-19, report them.
[25:16.000 --> 25:30.000]  Well, the Wuhan Bioweapon Lab and the Chinese operatives running Facebook and blocking the Pentagon and the president and AP saying it came from Wuhan, which is confirmed.
[25:30.000 --> 25:43.000]  And I just sat back and asked myself, is the president in an incremental trance not resisting this or is he part of it?
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  And I know Trump's not part of it.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  Trump doesn't think the public can handle the truth.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  Well, you know what? I think you can handle the truth.
[25:53.000 --> 26:05.000]  And in my experience, when people get slapped up against the face with reality, they're not wimps, they're ready to stand up against it.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  But see, most people are very humble.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  And so they don't see themselves as leaders and I want to tell people that are humble out there.
[26:14.000 --> 26:23.000]  I understand you're humble, but if you don't get motivated and very aggressive right now, we're going to lose our entire future and it's the end of the planet as we know it.
[26:23.000 --> 26:34.000]  One world government, microwave, you know, the torture system, absolute destruction of the youth, pedophilia, put Satanism out in the open.
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  Microsoft is financing unbelievable ads that show open Satanism and devil worship and demons being conjured.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  And there's 99% rejection of it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  And that's what's crazy about this is, even though we reject it spiritually, they are forcing it in.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  The TSA was just a little test.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  Border stays wide open, Islamists is poor in, but they're going to grab your five-year-old's genitals.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  Your daughter, your son, it's all an act of power over you and your family, an act of submission.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  And it's also about murdering common sense.
[27:12.000 --> 27:25.000]  I have a stack of announcements here where they're still bringing in thousands of Afghans a month and resettling them in Ohio and Texas and Michigan and Idaho.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  Thousands a month.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  That's just one country.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  They're being just brought in, oh, but you better stay in your house.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  It's all a giant fraud.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  80,000 people died of the flu in 2018.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  They're not counting anybody new in the last two months that died of the flu.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  They always say COVID.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  It's a hoax, folks.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Doesn't mean there isn't a real virus killing people.
[27:50.000 --> 27:59.000]  People are always dying, but billions are going to starve to death and be depopulated from this by the first world collapsing.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  That's admitted.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  You have the actuaries.
[28:06.000 --> 28:15.000]  The very you in running this is now like, oh, give us more money to help the starving third world.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  So I'm going to cover it all when we come back.
[28:19.000 --> 28:29.000]  But all I can tell you is that it's exactly how we foresaw it.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  Because you could see it all lining up and what they were beta testing and what they were doing.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  And it's exactly what we predicted.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  And then we know exactly what's going to happen next.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  And it's like sitting here watching.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  There's no wonder they've got to get us off the air.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  And again, when they kill me or arrest me, folks, remember, that's not a defeat.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  That's courage.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  And that's what we have to have.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  Because we're all dead anyways.
[28:54.000 --> 29:01.000]  We'll be right back as it was.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  And not just one, but all your devices with one out of the box set up.
[29:28.000 --> 29:37.000]  Plus flash routers also enhances your wireless network performance and unlocks powerful router management tools to let you take total control of your network.

[29:58.000 --> 30:00.000]  The official numbers are now in.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  The United States is in the biggest financial collapse in our history.
[30:05.000 --> 30:12.000]  This is the worst employment collapse in U.S. history by a very wide margin, writes Michael Snyder, the Economic Collapse Block.
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  At this point, we should no longer speak of economic collapse as something that will happen in the future.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  It is now here.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  And he does an excellent job in the article on infowars.com of laying it out.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  This was done by design.
[30:27.000 --> 30:39.000]  Trump fought to open the economy, but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricombs and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it into our lungs.
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.000]  And now we're lying there like a fish dying.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  There's not much time to get the water out of our lungs.
[30:45.000 --> 30:51.000]  So remember for decades to come when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine.
[30:51.000 --> 31:19.000]  The globalist did this, the globalist did this, the globalist did this, the globalist did this.
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.560]  at home you dirty filthy Americans, China is open for business, you aren't. And watch
[31:24.560 --> 31:30.840]  open satanic rituals with Lady Gaga and all these other losers stumbling around, again
[31:30.840 --> 31:36.800]  force fed to you and your family. It's all for one world, at home, the carbon tax, you're
[31:36.800 --> 31:42.200]  shut down. Your way of life has been cancelled by the globalists. They're coming with forced
[31:42.200 --> 31:48.280]  inoculations, implantable microchips, and total medical tyranny to take over your life.
[31:48.280 --> 31:54.160]  You are now non-essential. You are now non-essential. The new older got you where they want you
[31:54.160 --> 31:58.800]  and now they're going to slowly kill you and suck all the money out of you.
[31:58.800 --> 32:04.280]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off. The success is
[32:04.280 --> 32:09.800]  in full versus that. If you're paying attention, you know we've done together. But I'll tell
[32:09.800 --> 32:16.560]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy
[32:16.560 --> 32:21.840]  all independent forms of media. They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[32:21.840 --> 32:27.320]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[32:27.320 --> 32:30.760]  and everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true. So it's
[32:30.760 --> 32:35.960]  now that your credibility is way up. The power structure should have silenced those of us
[32:35.960 --> 32:42.600]  that they can't. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have
[32:42.600 --> 32:48.960]  the power. But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make
[32:48.960 --> 32:54.080]  sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long, dark night doesn't come. So be
[32:54.080 --> 33:02.080]  in the polar veers you are.
[33:02.080 --> 33:18.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:18.560 --> 33:31.440]  Well I won't back down. No I won't back down. You can stand me up at the gates of hell.
[33:31.440 --> 33:45.040]  But I won't back down. Gonna stand my ground. Won't be turned around. And I'll keep this
[33:45.040 --> 33:59.920]  world from dragging me down. Gonna stand my ground. And I won't back down. Hey baby.
[33:59.920 --> 34:12.800]  There ain't no easy way out. That's right. Hey I will stand my ground. And I won't back
[34:12.800 --> 34:20.200]  down. And I won't back down. Because I know it's right. But we've got one life. Alright
[34:20.200 --> 34:30.080]  thank you Johnny Cash coming in there with a great cover of the Traveling Wilberleys.
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.880]  You've all got just one life. Alright let's lay it out here. It's Providence they played
[34:35.880 --> 34:38.200]  that song. I didn't tell them to play that song. I probably haven't played that song
[34:38.200 --> 34:44.400]  in years. But sitting in there on the computer in the Phantom Zone until it was put out worldwide
[34:44.400 --> 34:51.000]  all you great people. And I was about to come back in and say that there's no easy way out
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.560]  of this. In fact people thinking they go along to get along is what has allowed us to get
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.160]  in this position now. And the more you submit now the more you're gonna be enslaved. Because
[35:02.160 --> 35:08.000]  this has been the plan stated to cut off your carbon to cut off your life to cut off your
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.560]  mobility to absolutely bring you down to a below a third world status and then lower
[35:13.560 --> 35:23.600]  the third world into total starvation. Hey baby there's no easy way out. Stand my ground.
[35:23.600 --> 35:29.840]  Because you can't back down. More than two billion people of the seven and a half billion
[35:29.840 --> 35:35.160]  on this planet according to the UN cell numbers and those are pretty accurate numbers. Are
[35:35.160 --> 35:44.160]  at starvation level. Look it up. On average about 12 million people it's estimated die
[35:44.160 --> 35:59.800]  of starvation and malnutrition every year. And there is a quiet elitism. It's not racism.
[35:59.800 --> 36:12.440]  It isn't a thing. Tribalism is what there is. And we think about it as oh that's the
[36:12.440 --> 36:18.480]  third world. That's Africa. That's Latin America. That's areas of Asia and Middle East. And
[36:18.480 --> 36:23.800]  again those people are uses weapons against us to come in drive down wages to vote for
[36:23.800 --> 36:30.080]  globalism. So they've been made the enemy and many of them are the enemy because they're
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.160]  in a bad position. They've already been enslaved. They're being thrown at us like somebody picks
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.720]  a rock up and hits you in the side of the head with it. The rock's not bad. The globalist
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.800]  just picked it up hits the head with it. Doesn't mean we capitulate and they manipulate our
[36:43.800 --> 36:49.240]  humanity and say give up your borders give up your sovereignty. Help the poor people
[36:49.240 --> 36:51.600]  because the globalists aren't trying to help them. They're trying to bring us down to their
[36:51.600 --> 36:58.280]  level so that they don't have anybody to save them. And when you deindustrialize and you
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.280]  collapse the first world just the estimates put out by Russia and the United States and
[37:04.280 --> 37:10.280]  Lord Monk that has his own that if they did a 50% carbon cut like they wanted by 2025
[37:10.280 --> 37:16.920]  they wanted the deal in place by 2008 didn't happen. That over a billion people would starve
[37:16.920 --> 37:26.800]  to death in the first decade. That's a billion. Everybody can sit there and play games. Well
[37:26.800 --> 37:32.400]  there are too many people it's for the earth because you're all taught that in the media.
[37:32.400 --> 37:41.560]  And even if you believe those numbers and believe that disinformation it's a plan to
[37:41.560 --> 37:47.160]  get rid of everybody. And now the globalists admit that they say a post human world is
[37:47.160 --> 37:53.800]  coming. And so the people that shine on to be guardians of the earth to get rid of the
[37:53.800 --> 38:01.320]  excess population and sterilize these third world folks for their own good. The truth
[38:01.320 --> 38:07.160]  is they're just psychotics that want full control and full power. And they're the people
[38:07.160 --> 38:13.280]  at Cold Springs Harbor and at the Royal Academy in Britain that created Hitler on record
[38:13.280 --> 38:21.040]  in Pulitzer prize winning books like Rise and Fall the Third right by sure and others.
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.880]  So that's why it's like if you've watched Star Wars you know who Darth Vader is. Well
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.360]  it's like if you've read history books you know who Bill Gates's dad was and Thomas Watson
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.360]  and James Watson and who ran the human genome and I mean they were these are the people
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.120]  you know giving Hitler the orders. I mean at Nuremberg they're listing Cold Springs
[38:41.120 --> 38:50.760]  Harbor and how they were under US command. Hitler was put in power by the British and
[38:50.760 --> 39:05.400]  US intelligence. So I'm sitting here knowing who the players are in horror saying Bill
[39:05.400 --> 39:08.680]  Gates is going to take over. He'll be the president of the world. He'll have forced
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.200]  inoculations. He'll have a digital tattoo to travel because he's been saying it and
[39:13.200 --> 39:26.360]  getting it ready for decades. And Bill Gates is on record saying kill the old people. Kill
[39:26.360 --> 39:32.280]  the third world. He's on record saying reduce humans down to zero to save the earth and
[39:32.280 --> 39:38.560]  the crowd laughs because they're part of the sick cult. Imagine their power trip. They're
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.960]  not going in industrializing the third world. They're not going in and trying to get people
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.000]  to only have two kids or whatever and actually building them up. No, no, no. They are using
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.840]  that as the excuse to have total power over everyone and they're putting vaccines into
[39:52.840 --> 39:58.040]  us that lower our immunity, lower our fertility and don't even protect us. And then when they
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.840]  got the third world as captives, it's not just the Constance Gardner where, you know,
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.360]  a fiction movie where he finds out they're injecting people with secret experiments
[40:07.360 --> 40:13.120]  in Africa and killing them. That's based on true stories, folks. The Constance Gardner
[40:13.120 --> 40:23.920]  is not fiction. It's going on now and it's going to happen to you now. Bill Gates has
[40:23.920 --> 40:28.640]  come out and said a lot of you are going to get sick and die from the vaccine, but it's
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.720]  for the greater good. They're going to externalize the method they've used at the health departments
[40:33.720 --> 40:38.320]  and they've used at the medical core level to go, yeah, there are a lot of bad side effects,
[40:38.320 --> 40:46.040]  but it's better for the greater good and saves billions that millions die. But the doctors
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.800]  are looking at the numbers and going, this isn't really true. What do we, what's in this
[40:48.800 --> 40:54.320]  stuff? Why don't people get clean vaccines? The doctors now learn that the rich people
[40:54.320 --> 41:01.880]  actually get electron microscopes scanned clean vaccines where it's just the pathogen
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.560]  and just enough adjuvant to make it work. And it still has side effects, but they, some
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.720]  of them, you know, I would choose to get something sometimes if it was really bad. But see, it's
[41:10.720 --> 41:18.440]  not, it's a cover for the larger operation. So the president has to understand this and
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.880]  we've chronicled every move of how they'd operate and what they're going to do next.
[41:22.880 --> 41:30.320]  And I can tell you that, and I'm not bragging about this, the Pentagon and intelligence
[41:30.320 --> 41:34.720]  agencies in the White House at this point are in awe of them full wars, how we continue
[41:34.720 --> 41:40.560]  to be way ahead of the curve. It's because Mr. President, we're not naive. And I understand
[41:40.560 --> 41:44.520]  why the Pentagon doesn't want to admit the deep state launched this attack on purpose
[41:44.520 --> 41:48.720]  because we have to go to war with who did that. And I understand why people don't want to admit
[41:48.720 --> 41:51.800]  all this is going on because you go out and you're going to go to parties with Bill Gates.
[41:51.800 --> 41:55.120]  You're standing right next to Satan. It's like Albert Spears said, you know, why were
[41:55.120 --> 41:59.240]  you with Hitler? And you were a good guy, supposedly as well. And the devil's got his
[41:59.240 --> 42:05.640]  arm around and you don't recognize it. If what I'm saying is true, we have to go to war with
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.160]  these people at the local level, the international level, the national level. And it's a horrible
[42:11.160 --> 42:16.440]  thing. But we're at war and they're attacking us, cutting our economies off. They launched
[42:16.440 --> 42:20.400]  the damn attack. They've been caught doing it. The Communist Chinese are now publicly
[42:20.400 --> 42:29.440]  running the censorship in the US. It's suddenly all over the nose. And everybody's kind of
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.080]  like, well, we're all invested in each other and well, they're everywhere and the Chinese
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.200]  spies are everywhere and the big foundations fund them and can we beat it and anybody sticks
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.440]  their heads up gets attacked. They're expecting you to not see what this really is and deal
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.080]  with it. But only by full commitment and recognizing it and being honest, can we. President comes
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.240]  out announces this. America already senses it. The world already knows we will destroy
[42:51.240 --> 43:01.240]  these people in hours. We can annihilate them now. It's us or them by OPQQ. Research that.
[43:01.240 --> 43:06.080]  Look into it for yourself. Big brother and the globalist don't want you to go. You can
[43:06.080 --> 43:12.080]  oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ 10 and then research DNA Force Plus and
[43:12.080 --> 43:19.960]  the types that we have in here. The very best forms of the BQQ and CoQ 10 and then a whole
[43:19.960 --> 43:27.080]  bunch of other natural ingredients for Mother Nature that are known to supercharge it all.
[43:27.080 --> 43:33.000]  This is our best selling overall formula. And I told listeners at the end of last year
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.520]  that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.040]  to fund our operations. But because of what's happening and going on in the world right
[43:43.040 --> 43:49.760]  now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force
[43:49.760 --> 43:59.760]  Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family. DNA Force Plus now 50% off.

[46:08.840 --> 46:14.360]  us, shutting us down and making us dependent on them. The food shortages have begun, the
[46:14.360 --> 46:18.400]  depression is going to be long and very, very serious. In fact, it's probably too late now
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.160]  to even turn back. Trump tried to stop it, but the mainstream media working with the
[46:22.160 --> 46:28.040]  tricombs blocked it. That's why you and myself and everybody else has to get prepared now.

[47:25.520 --> 47:36.600]  Now KQ Live to Austin, Texas. In the heart of the resistance, you know, people ask me
[47:36.600 --> 47:45.880]  why I live in Austin. It's basically a toilet for California. And it's because it's where
[47:45.880 --> 47:57.120]  my family's from. Since it was Mexico. But don't worry. I won't be here much longer
[47:57.120 --> 48:08.040]  in this city. Everything dies. Everything fails. But what's important is that things
[48:08.040 --> 48:20.560]  be reborn. And we have planted a lot of seeds, haven't we, my friends? The evil thinks it's
[48:20.560 --> 48:29.320]  going to win. All it's done is sow the seeds of its destruction. I can feel God's spirit
[48:29.320 --> 48:38.120]  thousand times stronger than I've ever felt. The awakening has begun. The enemy will push
[48:38.120 --> 48:47.000]  the boulder to the peak of the hill. And as world government stands for a year, it will
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.960]  collapse down on the enemy. And those of us that stand against it through this tribulation
[48:52.960 --> 48:59.080]  will be spiritually like Samson in the temple, though blinded and tortured, the dignity in
[48:59.080 --> 49:12.880]  the end of breaking and knocking it down. Think about it. These are the times that
[49:12.880 --> 49:16.960]  try men's souls. Let me do this. I've not been doing this the last few weeks as an effect
[49:16.960 --> 49:24.720]  where I'm like, I can't continue at this point. What I have to cover is so incredible and
[49:24.720 --> 49:31.200]  so absolutely illustrative of what we're facing, what's going to happen next, and what is going
[49:31.200 --> 49:40.600]  to unfold out of that, that I will do my best because I keep trying. And I think I've laid
[49:40.600 --> 49:44.440]  out a lot of stuff so far, but not like I wanted to. At six after, I just prayed to
[49:44.440 --> 49:48.880]  God to give me the focus and the clarity to hit it with just the facts and just lay out
[49:48.880 --> 49:54.120]  the big dimensions of this without going into a little minutiae like I like to do to prove
[49:54.120 --> 50:05.320]  each little factoid. But it is untenable and outrageous and unacceptable to have the communist
[50:05.320 --> 50:15.520]  Chinese officially given the run of the big five tech companies to censor people all over
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.000]  the world and to ban anyone off their platforms that says they're going to go out and protest
[50:21.000 --> 50:30.280]  to reopen America. We've been so broken by big tech with their training toy that was
[50:30.280 --> 50:34.880]  yours truly and others that oh, it's just him being banned and oh, it's just this person.
[50:34.880 --> 50:45.840]  And now all of you are told stay in your house and shut up. And then when Owen did that,
[50:45.840 --> 50:49.960]  every other Twitter account that our host have was banned and they said because we committed
[50:49.960 --> 50:55.720]  a crime of saying we protest, we have the First Amendment, we're going to go exercise
[50:55.720 --> 51:03.680]  the right of assembly because a dirtbag slimy mayor said we can't. But the homeless can
[51:03.680 --> 51:11.880]  run around and they can have their gay pride parades. It's all about pissing in your face.
[51:11.880 --> 51:17.720]  And they're all these useless followers that think they're part of the power structure
[51:17.720 --> 51:21.600]  going along with this. They've had nine deaths in Travis County. And it turns out they're
[51:21.600 --> 51:25.560]  all misattributed to people that had heart failure and cancer and were like 90 years
[51:25.560 --> 51:33.240]  old. And they put up fake news everywhere showing this whole family died total bull.
[51:33.240 --> 51:39.120]  They now admit the hospitals in the US and the UK are four to seven times emptier than
[51:39.120 --> 51:44.240]  they are on normal times. You go by hospitals. There's just no cars there. Usually hospitals
[51:44.240 --> 51:54.320]  are just full of vehicles. Nobody's there. And they Cuomo admits, oh, it was all a hoax,
[51:54.320 --> 51:57.840]  you know, but we're still going to have martial law. We didn't need one tenth of ventilators.
[51:57.840 --> 52:01.280]  We thought, okay, the hospitals are empty. Everything I've been told was you exaggerated
[52:01.280 --> 52:08.240]  10, 15, 20 times because they couldn't keep denying. They're like, oh, yeah, lots are
[52:08.240 --> 52:12.280]  dying. It's the end of the world. They take everybody that dies that has the common cold
[52:12.280 --> 52:17.240]  virus antibodies in them or test for any type of coronavirus on the other blood test. And
[52:17.240 --> 52:20.960]  they call it a death from that. You die in a car wreck. You die of a heart attack. People
[52:20.960 --> 52:27.040]  go 33,000 have died in the last few months. That that much you're dying every day of other
[52:27.040 --> 52:41.400]  stuff because people can't wrap their minds around that we're 350, 60, 70 million people.
[52:41.400 --> 52:45.960]  Oh my God. All right, I said I'd get to all this. And we start the next hour. I am, but
[52:45.960 --> 52:50.480]  I've got a bunch of clips and I want to open the phones up as well. And we have Owen Schreuer
[52:50.480 --> 52:59.600]  in the third hour ahead of Nick baggage, Dr. Nick baggage in the fourth hour. But things
[52:59.600 --> 53:04.240]  have gotten so much more twilight zone in the last few weeks. And I'll just leave it
[53:04.240 --> 53:15.000]  at that. And I personally am at peace. But I when it comes to getting the word out to
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.360]  people, I'm not at peace. This is the most important time ever, because this is deciding
[53:19.360 --> 53:23.320]  the future of things. And this is just such a dramatic attack on all our freedoms. And
[53:23.320 --> 53:26.520]  it's so insane. And they don't want us to have hope. They don't want to be prepared.
[53:26.520 --> 53:32.560]  It's crazy. And I wasn't joking 20 years ago when I said someday they'll say it's a conspiracy
[53:32.560 --> 53:36.120]  theory that mothers ever breastfed children or that there were vaginal births. They're
[53:36.120 --> 53:40.160]  now basically trying to get rid of vaginal births. Everything's unnatural. I've joked
[53:40.160 --> 53:44.400]  and said maybe the FDA will come out and say food is non essential. And you don't really
[53:44.400 --> 53:47.760]  need nutrients at all. They already say you don't need vitamins and minerals. Like saying
[53:47.760 --> 53:52.560]  you don't need oxygen. I'll probably get an FDA letter for saying you need high quality
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.000]  storeable food during an emergency like this to give your body sustenance and to make sure
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.400]  you have food in the future during the depression they're artificially creating. And this stuff
[54:01.400 --> 54:05.840]  lasts 25 years and is about one fifth the cost of food you get at the grocery store
[54:05.840 --> 54:10.520]  because the middleman's been removed. That's all true. But I expected to say snake oil
[54:10.520 --> 54:18.560]  salesman Jones claims you need food to live during a depression. You know all you need
[54:18.560 --> 54:27.200]  CNN. That's how ridiculous all this is like all the things. Oh tap water is the best water
[54:27.200 --> 54:30.920]  study show. No, there's no study show. That's a damn lie. It's full of glyphosate. They're
[54:30.920 --> 54:35.440]  there. Damn poison. You can imagine in big cities. Most well waters full of glyphosate.
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.000]  You're crazy. You're not filtering your water. I don't care where you get it. Get it. They
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.480]  have national lose. Jones is scammer. He says the water's got toxins in it. Get a water
[54:43.480 --> 54:50.680]  filter. It's like saying we're driving down the highway. You need a windshield so bugs
[54:50.680 --> 54:57.480]  don't hit you in the face. Jones is a kook. He sells windshields. You know. Jones is Jones
[54:57.480 --> 55:01.640]  claims you want to go scuba diving you to mask and snorkel. That's a scammer. You don't
[55:01.640 --> 55:07.560]  need that. You know. You need to get your storeable food now. We have the biggest best company
[55:07.560 --> 55:11.800]  because when stuff hits I want folks that can deliver it and that people are gonna like
[55:11.800 --> 55:16.640]  it so you appreciate us. We appreciate you. That's how we do this. It's not even a business
[55:16.640 --> 55:20.200]  model. It's just I go out and get the biggest and the best. Everybody else was sold out
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.000]  nine, 10 weeks ago. They lied. Most folks never got their food from other companies.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.360]  Got the food on the schedule. They were told they would get it. We have literally one half
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.760]  of percent of a charge back level on storeable food because folks were told upfront and they're
[55:34.760 --> 55:37.960]  very happy and it's the best, highest quality storeable food you're going to get for the
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.840]  price. You can pay five, six times the amount. Get some gourmet stuff that tastes better.
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.680]  But a lot of this stuff tastes amazing. Most adults, the rest of it tastes good. But I
[55:46.680 --> 55:51.440]  mean, yeah, some of it doesn't taste too gourmet, but it's got a lot of calories, a lot of quality
[55:51.440 --> 55:56.640]  and you need food to live. I don't care what the FDA says. You die without food. They'll
[55:56.640 --> 56:02.720]  call it a conspiracy theory, but I'm a food snake salesman. I'm so evil. I'm so bad.
[56:02.720 --> 56:05.640]  I said they're going to have food shortages and a depression and it's already starting
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.800]  if this keeps going. So get your orders in now. They've got it. They've got the food.
[56:10.800 --> 56:13.400]  They're packaging it. They're shipping it. And if they get to a point where there's too
[56:13.400 --> 56:17.880]  many orders, they will stop sales like they did for a while. But right now they've got
[56:17.880 --> 56:21.560]  it. They've caught up a lot. They told me they said almost every order is four weeks
[56:21.560 --> 56:25.640]  now, but don't tell them that. We've got to add two weeks so we're under promise of
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.520]  delivery. And I said, I just want them to know that let's just say six weeks, but depending
[56:29.520 --> 56:34.320]  on what they order, in fact, it doesn't matter. The point is, you want your storeable food,
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.520]  it funds our operation. To me, money is just fuel to keep this operation going in the face
[56:38.520 --> 56:42.520]  of the globalist as you know. I wanted money out of sold out to them and I can candy ass
[56:42.520 --> 56:46.480]  around and fly around in private jets and be in these New York or DC or LA with these
[56:46.480 --> 56:50.600]  mummies all kissing each other. I mean, it's totally horrible. You could, you put a gun
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.520]  to my head and I wouldn't join the globalist. I mean, you understand? It's like, oh, I didn't
[56:54.520 --> 56:59.240]  sell out. I'm so good. I'm high as a kite on the spirit of the universe. These people
[56:59.240 --> 57:05.120]  don't have that. I'll kill for this feeling. I don't want to be evil, man. I don't want
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.000]  to be around the mother way. People think, oh, when you're good, you're like some shrinking
[57:08.000 --> 57:15.200]  violet, a little wimp. I am a Tyrannosaurus flame breathing goblin. I mean, the close
[57:15.200 --> 57:21.080]  rocket to God, the stronger I get, the intellect, the piercing information, the discernment.
[57:21.080 --> 57:26.080]  It's like a Twilight Zone episode every day. I didn't have this until I went through the
[57:26.080 --> 57:31.080]  fire and got tested and it gets more intense every day because God is super charging me.
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.600]  The more I'm not fearful, the stronger I get. The more I double down, God goes, double down,
[57:35.600 --> 57:39.200]  double down, double down, double down. I'm doubling down on you. I'm doubling down. I'm
[57:39.200 --> 57:45.520]  doubling down. It's wonderful. I love the persecution. I love it. We will cross the
[57:45.520 --> 57:49.200]  Satanist. They will burn in hell.
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.640]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.760]  used by half. And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened along
[57:58.760 --> 58:04.560]  came COVID-19 and Bill Gates celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint
[58:04.560 --> 58:10.080]  by half. And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control. And of course,
[58:10.080 --> 58:14.760]  with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations, a microchip that comes with
[58:14.760 --> 58:20.680]  the vaccine and so much more. And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and
[58:20.680 --> 58:25.760]  die from it. So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your
[58:25.760 --> 58:30.800]  basic rights. The same left that says to kill babies all day long. Women own their bodies.
[58:30.800 --> 58:35.360]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you. If you don't
[58:35.360 --> 58:39.920]  submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home. Mark the beast. Oh, and guess what?
[58:39.920 --> 58:43.480]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch
[58:43.480 --> 58:49.800]  of dirty devil worshipers in your face. They hate you and your family.

[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:02.920]  Disgusting.
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:08.920]  Alright folks, we are currently in Austin, Texas
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:10.920]  here at the governor's mansion.
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:12.920]  This woman was driving into
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.920]  this protest. As you can see there's about
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:16.920]  50 to 70 people here now
[1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:18.920]  but these police stopped her car.
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:20.920]  They are currently forming a barrier
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:22.920]  and they're issuing her a ticket for honking her horn.
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.920]  So ma'am, they just

[1:01:51.960 --> 1:02:02.120]  all right ma'am so you're here today at this protest it seems that people are
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:06.120]  wanting to reopen the economy we've been shut down for a month now 22 million
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:09.480]  people have lost their jobs talk to us about why you're here today and talk to
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:11.720]  us about your sign as well
[1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:18.920]  um well first of all uh i just believe that um it's really important that
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:24.760]  that as americans and as texans we stand for the rights of all people the
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:33.240]  liberties the constitutional rights for all people
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:36.280]  so i have a lot of family members who have been laid off
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:41.480]  or for load uh you know i feel like the whole unemployment crisis you know at
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:45.320]  30 maybe plus now unemployed that that's hurting
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:50.280]  people quicker and at with a wider range than any virus
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:54.520]  has so far for small business owners and we know lots of small business owners
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:57.560]  and the restaurant industry in particular that have completely gone
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:01.720]  under and had to shut down the day we shut put they locked down texas
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:05.400]  our numbers cut in half the day they locked down texas and we know lots of
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:08.520]  people that just need to get back to work we're not scared of the virus let us
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:13.240]  choose we'll take the risk if we want to do it if you don't stay locked inside
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:16.280]  have you had to unemployment anyone um in your small business
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:19.960]  half of our staff we believe that our rights are being
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:23.800]  violated that people um need to be able to work
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:28.360]  and we need to reopen the economy and end the shutdown
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:32.520]  what we do is we're a glass and window business and so money is another thing
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:35.560]  right now who's going to go out and spend money to get new windows done who's
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:38.600]  going to go out and spend money when we're in a crisis and we're in an
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:43.240]  economical crisis you know so um
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:47.400]  we're not as affected by it as a lot of people but our hearts go out to all the
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:50.120]  people that are but more so i'm concerned about
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:54.280]  all of the rights being taken away not just closing down the economy i mean
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:58.200]  rights are being taken away left and right honestly if somebody is sick or
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:01.880]  there's an elderly person then it's up to them to stay home
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:05.960]  but i feel like it's ruining our economy and we need to go back to work or
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:08.840]  we're going to lose our homes we're going to lose our families and there's
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:10.440]  going to be a lot about the problems
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:13.400]  everybody out here is hurting they want to go back to work
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:16.600]  listen to those people nine times out of ten do you want people to work these
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:19.480]  people wanting to work let them go back let everybody go open
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:24.040]  texas it's all worth asking like my son sign says he wants to go back to school
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:28.840]  he misses his friends i have a lot of clients who um i do taxes and luckily
[1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:32.680]  i'm an essential employee for whatever reason but my clients aren't so i have
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.960]  a lot of people that i know that everything was pulled out from
[1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:39.080]  underneath them they don't have any means to support their families or feed
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:45.000]  their children and it's not right i want i just got major roger stone news
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.600]  when we come back we will uh get to all of that
[1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:52.600]  stay with us ladies and gentlemen we've got a lot of breaking news coming up on
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:55.720]  this world-wide transmission
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:05:02.360]  it's staggering to realize that the real covid target is not in place with nobody's
[1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:07.160]  pointed out even the u.n the typing all this history admits
[1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:11.000]  that half a million people have gone from extreme poverty to
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.200]  borderline starvation just the last two months
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:18.360]  and the two million plus people will starve to death extra
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:21.880]  this year you know i mentioned to a colleague who cares
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:25.720]  but they said oh didn't average a whole way starving
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:29.080]  that's the reality of what's happened when we fred over a few
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:32.520]  hundred thousand dead in the west millions and millions of millions of
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.280]  shut down this economy are conscripted to a slow
[1:05:36.280 --> 1:05:40.440]  agonizing death by starvation and nobody's putting that talking point out
[1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:44.040]  because that's reality big pharma and big tech are
[1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:48.120]  involved in the takeover they're using our phobias for control
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:52.440]  that's the bottom line anybody signs on this is in the vast death and
[1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:59.960]  globally populations to choose a side
[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:13.000]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:17.960]  from the front lines of the info war
[1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:24.600]  all right if you just joined me we're into the second hour here
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:29.880]  i've known this for a long time but when i get up here on air and i say it
[1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:34.520]  i know why listeners really don't take it serious
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:38.760]  because when i say that google hired thousands of members
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:43.560]  of the stasi and are looking at moving their headquarters into that in
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:47.880]  germany their headquarters in europe or when i say facebook hired
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:53.640]  former top stasi people to help censor their and spy on people
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:58.280]  it sounds insane kind of like saying we'll all be on house arrest and
[1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:00.520]  bill gates comes out and says we're gonna have an implantable
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:04.520]  ink in the vaccine that puts a digital tattoo and you to show you've been
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:11.240]  given your vaccine it sounds insane except it's really going on and the
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:15.720]  way they would do the articles is like oh they hired the former top stasi
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:19.880]  and then that person will bring in thousands of their people
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:26.440]  but it's all happening it's all going on right now
[1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:30.120]  and you sit here and you look at this and you ask yourself
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:35.080]  big tech is the new telecommunications it's how most people communicate
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:41.320]  not over telephones but over voice apps over text messages and over their
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:45.400]  facebook and and twitter that's how you talk to people
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:49.160]  but then they can have ai and live time controlling what you can text what you
[1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:52.360]  can say and you know at first oh you can't say the n-word well i don't
[1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:57.160]  ever say the n-word why why would i want to
[1:07:57.160 --> 1:08:03.080]  so okay censor that and ten years later you can't send out an associated
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:05.720]  press link
[1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:11.720]  to documents that are confirmed that the WHO
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:17.800]  knew it was a bio weapon on a wuhan weapons lab and covered it up
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:23.560]  today they're also blocking the Nobel prize winner
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:27.480]  one of the top biologists in the world
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:31.960]  who discovered the hiv virus
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:40.520]  in 1983 he's come out and said he's looked at the bioscans
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:45.240]  it's a hundred percent man made he's being blocked
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:49.320]  now i'm gonna i'm gonna explain something see first it's oh
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:53.880]  block alex jones and laura loomer and and and then it's blocked Nobel prize
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:59.080]  winners and ap and twitter is now censoring
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:03.960]  president of brazil censoring the president of
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:12.360]  hungry censoring the president of the united states the president and congress must act now
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:16.360]  95 percent of internet traffic goes over
[1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:19.160]  four companies
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:25.320]  and a little sub fifth one but most of it over those four
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:32.920]  and it's in the news confirmed you've heard oh twitter and facebook let
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:37.240]  armies of chinese trolls put out this info but then when you read
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:40.360]  deeper whether it's google whether it's twitter
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:44.680]  whether it's facebook whether it's apple they have
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:48.760]  over the divisions the southern poverty law center
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:57.080]  the adl media matters snopes but now they're giving way
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:03.640]  to the communist chinese party and are actually in there
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:08.280]  heading up the divisions with armies of chinese
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.440]  and ai watching what you do

[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:37.080]  we just move on from there and see trump's super confident that's great but
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:40.840]  he's so confident he thinks

[1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:20.040]  with a vengeance the money's already run out for small businesses
[1:13:20.040 --> 1:13:23.320]  most people didn't get it trump admits that he said we got to turn back on
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:29.640]  no no no we can't and then facebook to issue warnings to
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:34.200]  users who've liked or clicked on coronavirus misinformation and they
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:37.560]  say if you link to ap we may ban you but we're
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:43.960]  going to certainly block it and it says ap is not allowed
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:47.560]  and they have this nice picture of oan twitter is facilitating the promotion

[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:09.960]  respecting establishment of religion well they sure shut the churches down
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:13.400]  or prohibiting the first exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.200]  or the press the rather people to peacefully assemble and the petition of
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:20.760]  government freedoms agreements well that all went out the door didn't
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:25.960]  scattered protests pushed back on us coronavirus stay-at-home orders
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:31.080]  you have to disobey because they choose what's essential and what's not while
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.840]  the border is still open and while they bring in thousands a month
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:37.880]  from the middle east and other areas totally unvetted and brought in the
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:40.680]  homeless can do whatever they want but you can't leave your house because you're
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:42.920]  a producer and you've got to be taught to not be a
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:46.440]  producer and brought to heal you've got to be totally
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:53.160]  and completely enslaved isn't that just darling and cupcake
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:57.080]  cute so what does the president need to do
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:01.080]  what do we the people need to do before it's too late
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:04.360]  we'll go to break i'll come back and judiciously get into this and
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.160]  then i've got a bunch of news and clips will get to after that and i do intend
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:13.000]  to open the phones up as well when i'm shroyers here with us but
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.840]  there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes and a lot of things i can't
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:22.520]  tell you about right now but let's just say this
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:26.120]  the enemy knows and that's why they want us off the air
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:29.800]  but everybody knows that i'm unfiltered and just tell you what's going on
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:33.000]  and it all this is public too but we told you before it came out
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.120]  so can you imagine what the pentagon of the white house think about info wars
[1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:39.160]  right now that's why we could be taken off the
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:42.440]  air at any time because they don't want this source of information
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:46.120]  to the president but it's okay you know how things work
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:49.640]  and no matter what happens to me you're gonna continue on
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:53.400]  we know who did the bio attack we know was the deep state with the chai comms

[1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:13.880]  food well when our sponsors food began to run
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:17.240]  short they just didn't sell so they opened more factories

[1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:33.240]  is killing food distribution farming you name it and now it's
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:36.920]  mainstream news that food shortages and delivery are already
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:40.200]  starting to happen if trump can turn the economy back on
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:45.320]  and rest control of our system away from the globalist things may be okay but it
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:48.680]  looks like it's going to get very very rough so again ladies gentlemen

[1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:38.280]  and we are in the final days of the republic absolute slavery
[1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:43.640]  martial law forever under the cover of viruses it's a fee for vendetta
[1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:49.560]  script and it's in your face and the very people that created the virus
[1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:54.200]  gave it to china released it covered it up got it over here are now blaming
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:58.520]  president trump it's a script and we're just following it but it's so
[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:06.600]  diabolical it's so evil it's so ridiculous
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:11.320]  the pentagon keeps going uh we don't think it's been made uh
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:16.520]  we don't think it's uh china did her own purpose because if that's true we gotta
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:20.760]  we gotta go to war with them and i understand
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:25.320]  that president trump
[1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:28.920]  i keep forgetting to put this on i gotta rebroadcast for a while let's do that
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:31.480]  because this thing's been off for a while and i just need to get my earpiece
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:37.400]  back in so um you know
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:44.440]  here here's what happens we get hit by this big massive globalist attack
[1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:48.040]  and it's so crazy there's all these americans ally with communist china and
[1:21:48.040 --> 1:21:50.760]  hollywood's out to get us and they're trying to bankrupt the country and
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:53.800]  everybody else is opening back up and people are just dumbfounded by this
[1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:56.920]  they go well if i just wear my mask and do what i'm told
[1:21:56.920 --> 1:22:01.000]  everything will be okay like it always was no america
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.200]  had its own guardians
[1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:10.520]  america had people that weren't perfect but they cared about prosperity and the
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:15.080]  general welfare we don't have that now we have globalist in charge
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:21.080]  that are aborting america that want to kill it that want to destroy the idea
[1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:25.800]  that want to conquer it and so playing games and half measures
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:31.000]  and being politicians and playing patty cake with this
[1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:39.560]  is going to get us destroyed so the old rules of being chicken necks
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:43.240]  and being cowards is over
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:47.240]  let me just do this because when things are really bad and really crazy and
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:49.800]  really insane people need to be prepared and ready i tend to get in the mode
[1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:53.800]  where i don't even talk about things that we could at least do
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.920]  if you don't have firearms and ammunition you better get them
[1:22:56.920 --> 1:23:00.200]  i don't sell firearms and ammunition if you don't have water filtration
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:03.000]  you're insane you need high quality water filtration
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.760]  you'll let's appear and the sisters we have are excellent i think they're sold
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:08.920]  out so what's the point of plugging them you should just try to get them
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:13.800]  somewhere storeable food is an absolute no-brainer
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:18.360]  we have the biggest best company for the price the best food you're going to get
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:22.680]  because i i kind of look at it like price
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:26.200]  price versus quality so you got quality up here and you got price
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:30.280]  get the best thing you can for the price and that's who we have supplying our
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:33.560]  food it turns out they've been able to keep the supply going they've been able
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:37.000]  to deliver to people and not give the food industry a bad
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:41.560]  name it's why i have my patriot so now you go to infowarstore.com
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:45.400]  and you order they're ready to take your orders again
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:49.480]  and depending on what type of thing you order and they can't give you an exact
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:53.000]  answer that's why they say six weeks because it's really like four
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.800]  but they don't want to piss you off so you might order something that's a
[1:23:55.800 --> 1:23:58.920]  specialty item i take seven weeks but they're saying six weeks and they've
[1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:02.040]  been ahead of schedule though they asked me not to say that i just did it
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:04.600]  because i just can't help it i'm erotic about to all the truth
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.720]  the point is they have it it's high quality it's not about the virus folks
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:11.240]  it's a permanent shutdown food shortages have begun they're creating a
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:13.800]  depression and the numbers are out in the polls
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:18.600]  trump is unpopular trump's getting blamed for it
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:24.520]  and that was the plan you saw bill marr and all of them talk about it so
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:27.800]  these storeable foods are in big strong somebody grab me one of them
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:32.840]  big strong plastic hard containers that you have to break open
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:38.840]  with the seal and they're in big heavy sealed bags filled to the top inside
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:41.720]  and i looked at the numbers it's about one fifth the cost for the amount of
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:45.720]  food you get at the grocery store yeah bring on over to me brother thank you
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:51.000]  thank you very much sir so look at this ready hour

[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:11.960]  care of my family as well and i got stuff i bought from them 12 years ago
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:17.000]  in my attic and i got stuff i bought six months ago before all this kicked off
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:21.480]  in my garage and when i went out to the place we've set up in the country
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:25.240]  it took a bunch of this out there because i don't want to evacuate one of
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:28.760]  the worst things i ever did i just felt terrible doing it to even have to
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:32.280]  start preparing for the total collapse of us being taken off the air and
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:35.960]  knowing that that is now a real possibility
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:42.440]  and that we're at that point i'm not gonna lie to you but i i have never been
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:46.200]  more disgusted a lot of folks like to get into prepping and they feel kind of
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:48.600]  selfish they've got their cabin and their woods and
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:52.120]  it's kind of romantic and everything but for me because i'm on air and all this
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:55.400]  to think that we may get our asses kicked at least
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:59.000]  to this round have to shut down and
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:03.240]  and then they're gonna start arresting everybody during that and it's just to
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:06.520]  watch america on its knees makes me sick i don't really want to go down this
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:11.080]  road but i gotta tell you now folks
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:14.200]  you definitely want to get food to supplement yourself into the future
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:17.800]  you want food that's easily transportable and that you've got ready to go
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:21.240]  and there's not going to be any currency out there more valuable than food
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:24.520]  except liquor and you know that's why they keep that open as essential because
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:26.920]  they know you're not going to put up with not getting your liquor but the minute
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:29.080]  they want to cause riots what they're starting to do in europe
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:32.680]  they're going to cut the liquor off and crime is already exploding they've
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:35.880]  already got pirates attacking people in the gulf of mexico that's
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:41.160]  exploding the globalists have done actuary psychological warfare test
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:47.800]  they know what's going to happen and this is a time bomb
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:53.960]  and this is war the globalist for engage in economic and cultural war against
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:57.080]  us and they're using this overhyped virus as the
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:00.360]  pretext to make themselves the saviors and if you don't give them all the
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.000]  power and all the control over your life you're the bad guy well
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:07.080]  the answer is give yourself power and control over your life
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:11.160]  and at least get that three month supply of food and have that
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:15.160]  in your attic or in your basement or wherever as a supplement into the future
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:18.600]  knowing it's contained it's ready it's easily transferable
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:21.720]  if you got a bug out you're not putting stuff in paper bags or plastic bags and
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.920]  put the back of the truck you're putting it in waterproof plastic
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.880]  tote containers and you're ready to boogie out
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:30.440]  but
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:34.520]  this depression could i mean i could have done a whole show
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:37.720]  maybe we should and what a depression will look like with jose calzen
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:41.960]  and the breakdown of civilization because that's what the globalists wanted
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:45.640]  was to stall world economies and cause a mass die-off
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.960]  they thought slowly turning carbon off would do that but no one put up with
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:53.560]  that so now they're just demanding you don't leave your house to have a shutdown
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:57.880]  and the food packing and the farms and you know the the the the dairy cows
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:00.280]  are having to sell them to turn them into beef now
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:04.600]  because if you don't keep pumping the milk you got to dump it
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.880]  into a gutter and and if you don't want to dump it the gutter you got to sell
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:13.880]  daisy the holstein or the jersey milk cow for hamburger meat
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:17.320]  so they're now selling because the meat shortages
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:21.960]  the milk cows so when a country starts selling its milk cows off
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:25.640]  you know to get hit by a gas jackhammer in the head and their throat slit and
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.640]  turn into juicy hamburgers you're burning the candle at both ends boys and
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:33.560]  girls so i'm here to tell you the the engine warning

[1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:17.240]  cellular level understand it now if i would have
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:20.360]  hyped up the virus was going to kill three four five million people like the
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:23.800]  un did i live sold five times more supplements
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:28.280]  but you know what i didn't do that but i said on a routine basis regardless
[1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:32.760]  people are vitamin d deficient people are deficient i and i have so many other
[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:36.920]  issues you need those products regardless so we started selling
[1:30:36.920 --> 1:30:39.240]  out of bottom mineral fusion all the other products
[1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:43.800]  i cut the prices from 30 percent off to 60 percent off
[1:30:43.800 --> 1:30:46.920]  because i knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis
[1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:51.000]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies offenses
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:54.440]  but now i'm telling you with economic crises going on get your storeable
[1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:58.520]  food now
[1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:04.280]  now that this u n global government shy com billable indicates medical tyranny
[1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:08.120]  has seen how far they can push it now we just lapped it up
[1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:12.760]  like like poison you know now they're gonna launch more
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:17.880]  bio attacks and even more hardcore this early one
[1:31:17.880 --> 1:31:22.440]  does kill people but see it's a virus billable indicates own it's a virus
[1:31:22.440 --> 1:31:26.280]  that that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine you see
[1:31:26.280 --> 1:31:29.480]  a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for because it's
[1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:33.320]  always mutated but see because this is a chimera and lab
[1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:39.000]  made they can have a speciality so it's a whole giant franchise they can
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:42.120]  fill the rich off of it they can surveil everybody
[1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:45.240]  everybody gets to become a suspect and now when you would have low numbers of
[1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.640]  death it doesn't matter because they make a huge
[1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:51.160]  spectacle out of it you watch next year with the flu
[1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:54.280]  it'll even be bigger as well this is what they've done to us because we're a
[1:31:54.280 --> 1:31:59.240]  bunch of domesticated idiots how do you put a people under house arrest how do
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:02.040]  you put them under siege well you tell them you're
[1:32:02.040 --> 1:32:05.960]  protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up
[1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:09.480]  with the globalist deep state and then had china release
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:13.400]  to then take down the populist president and those pesky american people
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:17.800]  that have become too uppity bill mar even admitted man i hope we have a
[1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:21.000]  depression and now they've tailored the whole thing
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:24.280]  with the big corporations and the media are gonna keep
[1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:28.120]  the country closed along with the help of the blue states and blue states
[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:32.120]  all the time blaming trump and capitalism and americanism
[1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:36.520]  for the depression it creates if america is that stupid we deserve what
[1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:40.440]  happens to us but as for me i'm not sitting here and i'm not taking it
[1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:43.800]  it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people
[1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:47.000]  keep everybody safe but that's not what they're doing
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.200]  they are pulling america up by its roots and irrevocably
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:53.720]  damaging our savings our health our whole world
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:59.960]  and committing millions of third world people to death
[1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:07.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:21.560]  part of the guidance seems to sort of shift to states and
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:26.840]  and companies the burden not just of of additional testing and surveillance but
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:30.760]  also the sort of new normal on which you know there's
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:35.160]  smaller crowds and restaurants and bars and that's not going to be normal
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:39.320]  there's not going to be a new normal where somebody has been having for 25
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:43.640]  years 158 seats in a restaurant and now he's got 30
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:47.480]  or he's got 60 because that wouldn't work that's not normal no
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.000]  normal will be if he has the 158 or 68 seats
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:53.720]  and that's going to happen and it's going to happen
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:57.960]  relatively quickly we hope but that's our normal our normal is if you have a
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:01.640]  hundred thousand people in an alabama football game
[1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:05.800]  or a hundred and ten thousand to be exact we want a hundred and ten thousand
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.320]  people that we want every seat occupied normal is not going to be where you have
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:20.600]  a game with 50 000 people the new normal is you can't leave your house the new
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:23.480]  normal is you got to have a special apt facts of where you go the new normal is
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:28.840]  you're a total slave at the border statewide open
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:32.440]  i have a message to the president
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:37.480]  get out ahead of this go through the numbers that we've got
[1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:40.280]  that are from the linen guardian the united nations
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:44.680]  the left can't even deny these that an extra two million people are set to
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:48.200]  starve to death this year on top of the eight to ten million
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:51.800]  because of the shutdowns and because of industries
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:57.320]  that the west funds in latin america and africa and other areas
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:02.840]  that it's a death sentence to people that are paid less than a dollar a day
[1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:09.960]  working at the flower farms in africa that's one of the main
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:15.000]  employers in africa is flowers that that we have in our homes and you can say oh
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.920]  well that's a frivolous thing and it hurts the earth the carbon to fly
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:22.440]  those flowers and that's how they're living
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:26.280]  and so you cut the economy off the service economy that we were told
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.280]  was the whole future a half a billion people are put
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:33.480]  onto the edge of death and millions will starve to death
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:38.200]  even their own oxfam report admits
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:45.000]  see nobody's humanizing them and it's all a ritual to wear the mask and
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.960]  social distance and you know the people that do it are the virtue
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:51.480]  signals and they're the good guys
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:58.760]  it's truly disgusting i'm gonna lay on you right now
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:03.240]  some unbelievable information
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:09.000]  and all of this is incredibly important but but i want listeners to understand
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:13.160]  something this is life and death okay
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:17.640]  i want to lay this on the white house and on trump's lawyers
[1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:22.680]  and on the pentagon and on everybody else
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:26.040]  dramatic action is the only way out of this
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:30.200]  leveling with the people is the only way out of this that we're in a total war
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:33.880]  with globalist criminals allied with the communist chinese
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:37.560]  who developed the virus prepared the propaganda
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:42.200]  prepared the tv shows the movies the tabletop exercises with governments
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:45.640]  that literally spent hundreds of millions of us taxpayer money
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:48.760]  through billa melinda gates they don't ever spend their own money
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:53.480]  oh you're such a philanthropist such a sick joke to pre-program the response
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.560]  you're seeing that is the takedown of the industrial world
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.320]  something that thousands of bombers couldn't do
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:04.760]  with conventional munitions
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:12.600]  prepare yourselves for the ultimate smoking gun
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:17.320]  if you're a new listener you're tuning in and you're hearing me say that
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:23.480]  communist china the wuhan laboratory produced this man-made bio weapon
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:26.200]  and that they used it to then shut down the west
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:29.320]  knowing that the media here would demand an endless shutdown but not a shutdown
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:32.280]  for china that's just elementary military information
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:35.240]  and we predicted they would do that and now they've done just that and we
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:38.680]  predicted they'd win the president they've now just done that this is all
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:44.600]  two plus two equals four elementary my dear watson
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:48.760]  but it gets worse whether it's the w.a. show or the chai comms it's all
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:52.680]  billa melinda gates because they're this
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:59.320]  rockefeller carnigy ford ibm endowments that were all Nazi eugenicists on
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:02.920]  record this is mainline history this is like me telling you that
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:06.360]  volts wagon was designed by adolf hitler and the first vw bug
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:11.640]  drawn on the back of a napkin and and given to albert spear
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:14.520]  now if you don't know history you just think i'm putting out words i'll say
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:17.320]  that's like leptis they go oh you're talking fancy we know you don't have
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  anything behind that everything i said is totally true
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:24.840]  they are the architects of this entire thing
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:28.360]  including the rockefeller foundation with the carnigy endowment
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:37.800]  putting mal satong in power and gg ping
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:43.480]  so we talk about china it's that big giant force of a billion plus people
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:49.960]  and a scientific technocracy that is used by the globalist to attack us
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:57.800]  but it comes out of us it comes out of the west
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:01.400]  and i have no doubt that after this technocracy set up china is going to be
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:05.400]  sacrificed i don't want that for the chinese people
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:08.920]  but now they've been set up as our enemy
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:12.840]  so you could go through every facet of billum linda gates and their
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:17.160]  event 201 in october november with a 65 million dead
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:20.600]  with a corona virus that world governments brought in and digital ids
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:23.640]  are injected in the body and forced inoculations and they had to get it
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:27.720]  ready and then right on time it shows up
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:32.280]  and falchi who's over the technology transferring it 2012 through 2017 to
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:35.960]  china and he was criticized for giving gang a function
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:40.600]  for corona virus chimeras he says in 2017 don't worry
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:45.480]  trump's gonna be challenged by a new novel virus
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:49.560]  and he'll do what we say or he'll be gone he's a little arrogant monster
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:53.160]  because he's right there with bill gates who's given him hundreds of millions of
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:58.280]  dollars including 100 million dollars he was given
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:05.240]  in december just four and a half months ago
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:10.360]  but let me give you one more little juicy piece
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:13.080]  of hundreds
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:17.400]  we talked about how
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.200]  the Nobel prize winner that discovered hiv has come out and said he looked at the
[1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:24.680]  viral scans by the end of university and others
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:30.040]  and it's 100 man made and how facebook sensors ap and that information
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:33.720]  and the fact that they admit that wuhan covered it up the wuhan center with the
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:36.120]  un
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:42.680]  but look at this down here facebook fact checker worked at wuhan bio lab ruled
[1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:45.880]  out virus leak while debunking articles but it turns out she's a head
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:50.520]  scientist with bill millen gates foundation funding
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:54.280]  and it gets worse she runs the facebook science division
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.760]  and decides who is censored who isn't like ap saying you will not show actual
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:03.080]  documents that they covered up the virus release or that it's man made
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:05.640]  talk about conflict of interest talk about red-handed
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:09.640]  it's like having hitler be over the nuremberg trials when you look up dr
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:14.120]  daniel anderson what do you find at duke
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:19.800]  in u.s medical school she helped develop the test kit for
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:25.160]  covid-19 that's now set to make over 200 billion dollars
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:31.880]  oh boy the very lab that released it developed the test kit
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:39.080]  uh that's like the old rumors that i confirm with one of the
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:43.000]  heads of the virus companies antivirus digital viruses that they would create
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.600]  their own to get money and sure enough they said oh yeah yeah that we did but
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:49.400]  i'll kill you if you ever tell anybody they got a hitman with him actually but
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:52.680]  i'll stop right there probably guess what i'm talking about uh i was like
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:55.800]  dude you got a guy with like guns everywhere or what is it but anyways
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:42:01.000]  look at this dr anderson utilizes novel diagnostic platforms for
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:07.080]  identification of not only new viruses but also other clinically
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:12.680]  relevant emerging infectious diseases such as mirrors and the zika virus
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:17.720]  all bill gates specialties
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:24.120]  so she runs facebook and decides who can say what
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:28.600]  and she works high level at the bio weapons lab on record
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:33.320]  and she has the big global test that it turns out
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:38.760]  says all cold bugs are covid-19 to get a higher rate
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:41.720]  that then count every death as covid-19 when it's not
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:45.560]  so you talk about no wonder they want to censor everybody because they can't
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:49.480]  handle anybody studying who they did you're all caught
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:56.120]  and you're all in big trouble missy
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:42:59.720]  ten weeks ago i began to tell listeners they needed to get high-quality
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:02.920]  horrible food not because of the virus but because of the
[1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:06.760]  crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because the
[1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:09.560]  globe was for planning to hold america hostage and run a
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:12.920]  blockade through the blue cities and blue states
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:16.680]  now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:20.360]  operation it's not predictions we have
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:24.120]  their battle plans so going back more than eight weeks ago
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:27.800]  all major storeable food companies were sold out except my patreon supply
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:29.800]  because they're the biggest of our preposition
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:33.080]  when it got to the point they had so many orders coming in
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:36.040]  that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner they stopped
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:39.640]  taking orders till they got caught back up well now they're caught back up they

[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:08.120]  history by a very wide margin writes michael
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:12.280]  snider the economic collapse block at this point we should no longer speak of
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:15.720]  the economic collapse as something that will happen in the future
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:19.240]  it is now here and he does an excellent job
[1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:23.240]  in the article on info wars.com of laying it out this was done
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:28.840]  by design trump fought to open the economy but the hijacked blue cities
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:32.680]  and states with the chai comms and with hollywood and the media
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:36.760]  held america underwater until we sucked it into our lungs
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:41.320]  and now we're lying there like a fish dying there's not much time to get the
[1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:44.600]  water out of our lungs so remember for decades to come

[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:32.600]  run on for a long time sooner or later gotta cut you down
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:38.120]  so you can't make this uh bill gates and the communist chinese
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:40.520]  government as well as the world health organization
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:44.520]  have their fingerprints publicly over the development of the virus
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:48.600]  the transfer of the weaponized covid-19 to the communist chinese
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:51.800]  salt confirmed and then one of the heads of the lab
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:55.240]  is the facebook fact checker that censoring ap
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:59.000]  and members of congress when they point out that it's admitted that the bio
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.680]  weapon came from wuhan she is over that and then it turns out
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:12.040]  dr danielle anderson on her own duke in us bio says she developed
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:18.920]  the kit test for covid-19 so the very lab that gave you the bio weapon
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:21.640]  now gives you the test where they're going to make hundreds of millions they're
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:28.440]  saying off this test now and she works for bill in the gates as well
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:34.680]  with i mean if this is just insane meanwhile facebook says run by her
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:40.680]  anyone criticizing them anyone saying that it could have come from china or
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:44.280]  wuhan even after china admits it came out of the lab
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:48.120]  you will be censored and who decides that her
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:51.560]  she's not just the top scientist in the lab she's not just over the
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:54.440]  test for the weapon that came out of the lab she
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:59.400]  censors the world you talk about a spider web i think
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:05.160]  we just found one of them didn't we wow and they hide it in plain view like
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:08.200]  we're so stupid
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:20.920]  wow wow wow and it just gets crazier because
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:24.920]  see they see humanity waking up they've got these plans on the blue
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:28.120]  on the blackboard the blueprints they go this will make them submit we'll lock
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.640]  them down it'll work and then they release it with their damn fingerprints
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:36.440]  all over it and the indian university's top
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:41.080]  scientist the german scientists top scientists and others
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:45.880]  us scientists go yeah we scan this virus this thing is as phony as a three
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:50.040]  dollar bill it didn't come out of some
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:54.520]  monkey or a dog or a bat
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:57.880]  it was man-made
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:04.440]  who are you who are your experts elixir i mean sure you said this 10 weeks ago
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:07.720]  and now they said all over the news that where'd you get that oh
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:11.800]  i got it from the Nobel prize winner the discovered hr
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:14.840]  they say it's probably the top virologist in the world but you know
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:18.200]  don't listen to the top virologist in the world i mean you know
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:25.640]  i mean they have sanjay gupta to tell us we don't need zikr vitamin d
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:34.200]  and this has become oh charges of censorship facebook the leading post
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:39.160]  about coronavirus leading to charges they tell you what's not allowed
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:43.480]  they say in facebook do not say it came from wuhan biolab
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:48.920]  and it's the woman that's one of the top scientists in the lab that got Fauci
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:52.600]  money telling you that
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:58.360]  that's beyond conflict of interest so let's go to this next piece
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:04.840]  copyright rush limbaugh
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:10.040]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:13.640]  from australia to the united states to canada
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:17.240]  they are calling for people to get in their parents faces during
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:22.040]  kids at home on government programming and cnn has played to all the public

[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:52.920]  this says all coronaviruses are covered 19 to create the hysteria
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:59.880]  these people are ridiculously obvious and stupid but if they dominate us
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:04.680]  we deserve it oh yeah coronavirus has started a
[1:52:04.680 --> 1:52:08.520]  censorship pandemic with the communist chinese

[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:36.680]  director of first draft and we are a non-profit that we
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.120]  help people navigate the challenges of misinformation online what happens is
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:44.840]  your dad doubles down on his view the post again what happens is we're paid
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:48.760]  by the communist Chinese that killed 115 million people
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:52.280]  and we're making a major move with Bill Gates to sterilize your ass
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:57.000]  so your dad if you challenge him doubles down don't do that yourself
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.720]  let us get in contact with you to actually take control of your life but
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:06.360]  we're claiming it's contact to get let us get between you and your daddy

[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.360]  and he dismisses what you're saying use language that's empathetic and to say
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:19.480]  we're all in this together and rather than you're wrong
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:23.560]  i'm right here with the facts because that does not work so hold back on all
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:26.680]  that reactive talk maybe try something like this
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:30.440]  yeah these are scary times we're all a bit afraid but let's be careful
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:33.880]  what you're sharing is inaccurate and it feeds into that fear we all
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:37.160]  feel
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:40.680]  what you're sharing because if dad back it up if dad talks and says it came out of
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:45.960]  the bio weapon lab which is confirmed i mean folks if you were just this is
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:50.760]  like a science fiction movie this is happening and notice nothing against
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:54.520]  women it's women they've got collaborating let's continue
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:59.240]  talk maybe try something like this yeah these are scary times we're all a bit
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:02.760]  afraid but let's be careful what you're sharing is inaccurate and it
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:07.240]  we all feel everybody's like i'm sorry i'll come back with this
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:10.040]  no the globalists are creating the fear and shutting down the economy they'll
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:14.280]  destroy the third world and our world but oh dad oh you're feeding into the
[1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:18.120]  fear just stay at home the chinese love you sure they
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:21.160]  got three million people in death camps but dad sure they killed people like

[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:50.680]  the world health organization run by the chai kong murderers
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:55.800]  and world citizen are giving you the world at home
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:00.680]  extravagance of all the dried up pathetic evil twisted
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:05.720]  hollywood music crap force fed at you and your family
[1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:10.520]  so stay at home you dirty filthy americans china's open for business you

[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:17.720]  lady god god all these other losers stumbling around
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:21.640]  again force fed to you and your family it's all for one world
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:27.640]  at home the carbon tax you're shut down your way of life has been cancelled by
[1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:30.600]  the globalists they're coming with forced inoculations
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:35.320]  implantable microchips and total medical tyranny to take over your life
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:39.560]  you are now non-essential you are now non-essential
[1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:43.560]  the new owner got you where they want you and now they're gonna slowly kill you
[1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:47.240]  and suck all the money out of you
[1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:50.920]  and all the sudden the trap snaps
[1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:55.560]  and inside hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:58:55.560 --> 1:59:00.040]  going back to magna card in 1215 of hard fought basic human dignity
[1:59:00.040 --> 1:59:03.320]  and liberty and believing that the individual was sovereign
[1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:07.960]  and had basic unenable rights has been absolutely
[1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:13.160]  erased just in March and the communist chinese
[1:59:13.160 --> 1:59:17.800]  and then our teachers and big tech has been our controllers we're all being
[1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:21.080]  introduced now the digital straight jacket that
[1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:25.480]  depends on us complying with it and depends on us all
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:30.520]  henpecking each other into submission but for all of you out there that have
[1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:33.880]  decided to go along with this mark your calendars down
[1:59:33.880 --> 1:59:36.760]  and then a few months a few years look at the world remember
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:40.440]  you did this you were the prisoners you were the slaves
[1:59:40.440 --> 1:59:43.960]  you were the people that crouched down and licked the hand to fed you
[1:59:43.960 --> 1:59:48.440]  ask for me give me liberty or give me death
[1:59:49.320 --> 1:59:54.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:03.880 --> 2:00:10.360]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening
[2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:17.080]  to the alex jones show well we told you the man assault was coming in 2020
[2:00:17.080 --> 2:00:20.360]  because it one thing these globalists are neurotic they obsess over
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:23.720]  little timetables and they put them in all their little publications like we're
[2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:27.640]  animals they go the public are dumb animals we'll dump them down chop their
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:30.840]  balls off make it trendy destroy their families poison them we'll
[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:35.240]  never know what hit them by 2020 we'll launch the bio attack
[2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:39.320]  have them all locked down have drones controlling them bankrupt their economies
[2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:44.760]  shut down the third world star billions to death
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:51.160]  but we knew it was coming and we didn't believe the globalists when they
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:55.720]  said oh they're profane they'll never oppose us
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:59.640]  we made preparations to fight them and so now
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:08.200]  they're having to admit that bill gates is being targeted by social media mobs
[2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:11.240]  the people that are being censored and knocked down and attacked
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:18.680]  and silenced are 99 does one just annihilating him with links to how he's
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:22.680]  behind bio weapons and depopulation how his employees are heavily involved in
[2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:28.280]  the covid-19 production he's being destroyed
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:33.080]  and so the wall street journal comes out and says look at these conspiracy
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:36.920]  theorists they say bill gates is involved how
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:40.120]  think about the psychotic one-dimensional thing of gates
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:43.720]  he thought he'd put out that abram abranovic
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:48.360]  high priest of crowley video all over place and people would like it
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:51.320]  where she like appears like a demon in a pentagram all this stuff
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:55.240]  99% literally rejected it just like everything else he does
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:58.760]  we see through you boy
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:04.360]  you know everything else i do from here on out is icing on the top
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:10.920]  seriously and everything because
[2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:15.720]  son you think you know about the dark side you don't know nothing
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:20.280]  and these devil worshipers are deceived they haven't been given the full picture
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:22.840]  and they really think they're in power and they're in charge they're just here
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:28.040]  to test us and it's gonna be rough like boot camp but jesus is real god's real
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:31.240]  and goodness is real and we're gonna make it through this
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:36.280]  but yeah it's it's it's pretty incredible uh what's going on i mean
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:39.720]  look at rothschild and their demon witch they worship
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:42.840]  this hog-like ugly woman that looks like a
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:47.080]  i mean a pig's butt is prettier and and and that's who they
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:51.800]  literally think is the queen of the earth bill gates hangs out with her too
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:55.240]  and jeffrey upstream just be glad you're not these people
[2:02:55.240 --> 2:02:58.360]  because everything they're doing is they're weird satanic hallucination
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:02.120]  let's go out to break with dr phil media matters and george soros is angry with
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.840]  him he came out and said we should reopen the economy
[2:03:04.840 --> 2:03:08.360]  dr phil's now a thought criminal see a lot of folks you thought were going on to
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:12.200]  get along will actually join us in the end because i realize there's no hope
[2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:16.040]  unless you stand up against it we'll go to break come back with oan schreuer
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:19.800]  that door is going to open soon and it's kind of like the pace car
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:23.960]  uh at a NASCAR race when that pace car pulls off the track you want to be at
[2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:26.360]  full speed let everybody else be looking for their
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:28.280]  keys and figuring out what they're going to do
[2:03:28.280 --> 2:03:32.040]  you want to be up to full speed you need to you mean to have your mind busy
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:35.720]  you need to be working and and doing things every day
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:40.360]  don't be sitting around because particularly elderly people their mind
[2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:44.200]  will begin to wander and they will not become cognitively
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:49.800]  active you've got to be cognitively you you've got to be cognitively agile
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:53.960]  this really has an effect on people neuropsychologically i've been talking
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:58.280]  with my colleague dr marty greenberg and we're very concerned even about people
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:02.440]  in their 30s and 40s losing a step cognitively by being in quarantine
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:06.920]  yeah and kids to go back into the kids have to be hearing from their teachers
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:10.920]  at the same time every day as if they would in school on video you got to do
[2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:14.200]  something all right question from don what can people do to avoid
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:17.160]  confrontation with other members of the household
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:20.600]  since everyone is forced to stay home together dr phil might be the last
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:24.360]  right house so yeah that's a tough thing you've really got to give each other
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:27.080]  space and it and i mean space mentally
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:31.080]  emotionally physically and before you judge somebody
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:33.800]  you need to realize you're probably a jerk too
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:38.600]  so just back off and give everybody some space this will end soon we probably
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:42.680]  shouldn't have ever started this but just realize there's a light at the end
[2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:45.320]  of the tunnel we need to get out of this and get back to
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:51.480]  dr phil fan now we never should have started this yes yes yes find your
[2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:54.760]  fight say no
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:04:59.080]  i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off
[2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:04.040]  the success is simple versus that if you're paying attention you know we've
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:09.640]  done together but i'll tell you this the technocrats
[2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:13.400]  are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:16.520]  independent forms of media they're trying to shutter
[2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:20.040]  and silence human resistance so now is the time
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:23.480]  to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:26.680]  everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true
[2:05:26.680 --> 2:05:31.640]  so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structure to silence
[2:05:31.640 --> 2:05:35.800]  those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:40.120]  to not let them silence any of us we have the power
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:44.440]  but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech
[2:05:44.440 --> 2:05:48.200]  we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long
[2:05:48.200 --> 2:05:56.040]  dark night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:06:13.320]  to get to the science here because i i assume all of us are following
[2:06:13.320 --> 2:06:18.680]  the lead of epidemiologists arresting someone for sitting alone on the beach
[2:06:18.680 --> 2:06:23.240]  tell me how that arrests the spread of the coronavirus from an epidemiological
[2:06:23.240 --> 2:06:26.360]  point of view yeah i wasn't referring to that i
[2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:30.760]  actually don't have the specifics as to why that happened i met congregation
[2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:34.200]  at state and county parks of which there was an enormous amount
[2:06:34.200 --> 2:06:38.040]  when that the weather got warm and the fact that folks weren't
[2:06:38.040 --> 2:06:41.080]  it's not that they couldn't be in the park and jogging by themselves or
[2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:43.800]  walking on their own and keeping distance they weren't
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:46.760]  and there were a lot of out-of-state license plates
[2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:50.680]  in the parking lots and and we've got some of the nicest parks in the northeast
[2:06:50.680 --> 2:06:54.040]  if not the country again it brings me no joy but we felt that was the right
[2:06:54.040 --> 2:06:56.920]  decision to make
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  so you made that decision and as i noted before 15
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  congregants at a synagogue in new jersey were arrested and charged
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:10.600]  for being in a synagogue together now the bill of rights as you well know
[2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:14.360]  protects americans right enshrines their right
[2:07:14.360 --> 2:07:18.120]  to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:21.960]  together to assemble peacefully by what authority
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:25.640]  did you nullify the bill of rights in issuing this order
[2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:29.960]  how do you have the power to do that that's above my pay grade tucker so i
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:33.400]  wasn't uh i wasn't thinking of the bill of rights when we did this
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:37.320]  we went to all first of all we looked at the data i can tell science and it says
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:40.680]  people people have to stay away from each other
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:43.800]  that's the best thing we could do to break the back of the curve of this
[2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:46.600]  virus that leads to lower hospitalizations and
[2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:49.480]  ultimately and i'm not i'm not contesting that though i
[2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:52.920]  think it's i do i i do think there's a debate this is a rolling
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:55.560]  a rolling conversation because we're learning new things every day and
[2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:58.760]  nothing is settled at this point but i do want since you are
[2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:02.280]  since you are an elected official a leader in the government
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:06.920]  an executive how do you have the authority
[2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:11.640]  to order something that so clearly contravenes the bill of rights of the
[2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:14.360]  united states the u.s constitution where do you get
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:18.920]  the authority to do that well here's here's the thing
[2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:22.600]  we know we need to stay away from each other number one
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:25.720]  number two we do have brought authority within the state
[2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:30.360]  and number three we would never do that without coordinating discussing
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:33.960]  and and hashing it out with the leaders the the variety of the leaders of the
[2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:36.840]  face of new jersey we have we are among if not the most
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:41.240]  i'm sure i'm sure that i'm sure that you talk to every rabbi and priest but
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:44.680]  but there's a deeper question here and i i'm just gonna ask you one last time
[2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:47.320]  because i think it's important i'm sure you thought about this
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:52.120]  you can't just as the governor of a state tell people who they can talk to when
[2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:54.680]  and where because the constitution of the united
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.240]  states upon which all of this is based prohibits you from doing that so you
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:00.920]  clearly decided that you could do it did you consult
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:04.440]  an attorney about this did you i mean because there's a this is a legal
[2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:07.960]  question as well as an as a medical one isn't it
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:11.800]  i i don't go to the men's room without consulting an attorney so i i guarantee
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:14.200]  you we do that but i'll give you an example that was
[2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:18.120]  not related to the synagogue i called up cardinal toben
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:22.600]  cardinal joe toben in newark there are five or six archdiocese in new jersey
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:25.880]  was coming up to easter and holy week in particular
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:29.720]  and i said listen i'm really concerned about drive through
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:33.080]  holy communion because we had heard some stories about priests who
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:37.480]  unwittingly had the virus all right so the idea is if anybody could ever die of
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:40.040]  anything it can't be allowed we're all going to stay in our houses we bubble
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:41.720]  people we've got to be tracked in real time
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:45.320]  because they're wearing a state police outfit this is truly disgusting
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:50.680]  meanwhile this thing is not killed half of what the 2018 flu killed
[2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:55.160]  were 360 70 million people who count the illegal aliens probably 400 million
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:59.080]  this is an absolute hoax and now they're predicting that there is a
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:01.800]  vengeance against this people have been complying
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:04.920]  but they're pissed they know they were roped into it being told oh it's like
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:08.120]  an extended spring break i said yeah for the rest of your life
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:11.960]  this is economic warfare china's open for business but we're not
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:15.160]  letter fills come out and said this should never have been done
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:19.800]  this is a sick joke and the top neurologist in the world who discovered
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:22.360]  the hiv virus when it was so small nobody could find it
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:25.000]  didn't know what was happening he's come out and said we looked at it it's man
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:28.760]  made china ap has the documents new
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:34.040]  wuhan covered it up the who covered it up and you're seeing a desperate push by
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:39.000]  facebook twitter google to block anybody including congressman
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:42.760]  they're doing fact checks on senator cotton so
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:45.960]  if trump and the media
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:50.360]  getting their fights that's one thing but if they have mass censorship
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:55.160]  of people's views and things that are confirmed that's total tyranny
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:11:00.280]  and trump must act against this we got so used to censorship censorship and now
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:04.920]  our backs broken and we put up with anything and we've got all this
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:08.360]  unfolding and it turns out just such huge news folks
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:13.240]  that the one of the top scientists the wuhan lab works for bill and winigates
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:17.480]  daniel anderson and daniel it turns out came up with a
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:20.120]  coveted 19 tests that's going to make tens of billions of dollars
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:23.800]  conservatively and she works for them and it turns out
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:28.440]  that she runs facebook's fact checking and she's the one running the set so the
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:32.440]  woman behind the tests making the money the woman at the lab who has a stake in
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:36.280]  covering it up when it's confirmed she's the one saying what's
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:39.640]  censored and what isn't you can't make this up i mean
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:45.160]  oan shroyer thought criminal let's let's show media matters here
[2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:48.680]  media matters breathlessly yesterday had this video still of oan
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:53.320]  you know uh him with his mouth open and and said oh they're openly
[2:11:53.320 --> 2:11:59.640]  organizing twitter is facilitating uh not the child molestation the democrats
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:01.880]  do know twitter's facilitating the not the
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:04.520]  islamic invasion of democrats do know sorry not the
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:07.800]  chinese flying in you know and trump had to block them with coveted 19 oh no
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:11.240]  they weren't facilitating that twitter is facilitating the promotion of an
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:16.920]  info wars host rally that will flout texas social distancing order
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:21.160]  so you're going to exercise your first amendment of the right of assembly
[2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:25.400]  to go out there and say don't hold us hostage don't kill the third world
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:28.280]  half a billion now on the edge of starvation they say tens of millions
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:30.600]  could starve two million already starting to death
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:34.600]  they don't count though oan how dare you exercise your free speech
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:38.520]  the every damn account associated with you is deleted
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:42.520]  because you want to exercise assembly you
[2:12:42.520 --> 2:12:49.160]  piece of garbage well alex and how dare you be so upset that a
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:53.160]  nazi for media matters would be censoring us this is what we should
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:57.640]  be celebrating that we have nazis censoring people on social media but
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:01.320]  you know alex i think it's worse well cartfish here it's like i love that
[2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:04.600]  they even got a photo with your mouth open look at that you know they had to
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:08.120]  go through my broadcast how many times to get that shot right now so you know
[2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:14.680]  ah that's all right they can go to double car photo for media matters
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:19.480]  now let's talk about this but the communist chinese and the wuhan lab
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:24.520]  operator are in control of facebook i mean where's the pentagon if i see
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:26.760]  his control of facebook i should be arrested
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:30.920]  what when sits when do the chai comms run everything well not only that so
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:34.840]  they want to stop the information from flowing that this virus originated at
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:37.800]  the lab in wuhan but now she's also going to want to stop any
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:41.320]  information from flowing that this individual is about to profit
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:45.640]  massively off of the testing so it's like oh we release the virus and then we
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:49.320]  release the test i mean that's about as criminal as you can get right there
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:53.240]  arrest everybody involved and so he thinks he's a genius he's like
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:56.120]  this is funny she put this out if you're a radio listener
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:00.920]  this is on her own bio but alex think about the complete reversal of the
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:05.320]  reality of the situation here so she's complaining
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:08.600]  that it's coming out now that this virus originated in the wuhan lab by the
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:11.560]  way they're about to try to she's not complaining she's in command
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:15.160]  censoring how many people are on facebook now 3.4 billion
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:19.320]  they're already she's in command of what you can say and she's behind it
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:24.760]  china and so same cambridge university that said this was not a man-made virus
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:28.040]  has now come out and said this did not even originate in wuhan so somebody
[2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:31.640]  needs to be investigating cambridge university as well listen listen
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:35.240]  the Nobel prize winner for discovering hiv says it's man-made it was obviously
[2:14:35.240 --> 2:14:38.440]  man-made it's obviously from wuhan they're obviously covering it up
[2:14:38.440 --> 2:14:42.440]  my point is though see she's she's on you're saying oh we don't want to
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:45.160]  spread the fear we don't want to spread the panic when she knows this came out
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:47.720]  of a lab so see if you could actually be
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:50.760]  honest that this came out of a lab and was man-made
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:54.040]  then you could actually say okay you know what hey we got a serious situation
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:57.640]  here this is biological warfare launched by the chinese we need this to phase
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:14:59.880]  out we're gonna need a month we're gonna have to do some serious social
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:03.240]  distancing we're at war with china instead they're totally desperate
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:07.640]  blaming our speech when it's confirmed and how does the government put up with
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:11.400]  this chai comes run everything i want action
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:15.560]  from the president now no it's it's totally out of control
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:18.920]  and i'm not going to try to come out why are you so upset i don't wonder bio
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:23.160]  attack we're locked down in our houses since winter men trained
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.880]  but like i know a lot of men like if you bump in a store they're ready to kick
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:28.360]  your ass or if they're your dog craps the yard they go
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:31.640]  hey your dog just crap i'm like hey sorry like i'll beat your ass

[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:49.720]  now with china yeah yeah i mean i've had it
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:53.640]  it's time for action i don't know what the president's waiting on at this point

[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:14.040]  choices if we've learned anything from china and
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:16.840]  italy it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:21.480]  are just a few days away here in the us listen while dehydrated food is
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:24.760]  becoming scarce you can still get enough open pollinated

[2:20:02.600 --> 2:20:13.960]  one hundred and twenty years ago the most powerful robber barons in the world
[2:20:13.960 --> 2:20:20.120]  combined their fortunes and pledge to establish world government
[2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:23.880]  and planetary depopulation against the unwashed
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:29.960]  useful seers it's mainline history but people have forgotten it and now bill
[2:20:29.960 --> 2:20:34.120]  gates is probably right you deserve to die
[2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:38.360]  he says survival of the fittest social Darwinism if you don't stand up
[2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:41.240]  you deserve to die well guess what billy boy

[2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:52.760]  everywhere that nine nine percent of people hating
[2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:56.840]  they're saying he's behind it or it turns out his people are behind it
[2:20:56.840 --> 2:21:00.600]  it's not going the way old billy boy want like you were saying during the break
[2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:03.480]  i said what do you how do you approximate this oh when you were smart cookie
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:05.240]  i'll ensure your house the war room coming up
[2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:11.240]  in about an hour and 39 minutes from now you said well the world's rejecting it
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:16.600]  but he there's still force feeding it
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:20.360]  so it doesn't matter if he's on instagram if he's on facebook if he's on
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:24.520]  twitter if he's on cnbc if he's on cnn doing all of his media requests
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:27.720]  everywhere he's being he jumped the shark maybe
[2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:32.280]  but it's like and i don't know who made the meme i saw it on news wars dot com
[2:21:32.280 --> 2:21:35.400]  where bill gates is is like a skexie in the dark crystal
[2:21:35.400 --> 2:21:40.760]  but he is he's like time to make my move it's like this is bill gates it will
[2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:44.600]  kill a lot of you the vaccine oh it's good doll
[2:21:44.600 --> 2:21:49.880]  it's time to make my move i will hey we did tense for a little on my people are
[2:21:49.880 --> 2:21:53.800]  in charge time to die we're like okay dude when you try to
[2:21:53.800 --> 2:21:57.240]  kill us don't you get it's a two-way street well let me tell you
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:00.520]  alex let me tell you i think that uh anybody who's going to be defending
[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:04.440]  china and trying to blame trump on this is going to he's done that he's now
[2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:07.800]  saying oh don't blame china the who because they're blackmailing him remember
[2:22:07.800 --> 2:22:11.000]  china last week said you gave it to us and bates like
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.680]  cup leave alone china's good no no don't do it
[2:22:14.680 --> 2:22:18.760]  trump has to bring it all out and just burn them all flame throw them
[2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:22.040]  i think the next big narrative that's going to blow this thing out of the
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:26.600]  water is the fact that china uh and i believe it was november and december
[2:22:26.600 --> 2:22:30.760]  was stopping flights out of wuhan to everywhere domestically
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:34.360]  but international flights from wuhan were still going out now that was on
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:37.720]  record and the and the media was like federal judges block trump trying to
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:42.680]  stop flights from china how dare you and then they're blaming trump now
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:45.960]  so it's why is trump he's on the right track exposing
[2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:48.920]  that china's behind it and the who but he's gotta just
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:53.400]  he's gotta attack with everything now yeah i i don't know
[2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:57.080]  what is going through president trump's head it's the golden opportunity right
[2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:00.600]  now and america can't i mean we're on the precipice here
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:03.720]  i mean this is the we're gonna let that thing on screen right but that's like
[2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:07.080]  that's like the roth child like the old roth child royalty they're kind of
[2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:10.520]  losing control bill gates is now seeing like a virus
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:20.280]  care of them oh that will show them uh oh wait
[2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:23.880]  and bill gates is sitting back like yes you had your central banking
[2:23:23.880 --> 2:23:27.960]  you hadn't been thrown in bill gates right there he's like
[2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:32.760]  oh your central banks are failing your fake wars have been exposed
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:36.040]  kill everyone they'll forget about your Ponzi scheme
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:42.200]  but i'd accept everyone knows it's you i've got sent you think it scares me
[2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:45.320]  of the stuff you've got jacked up i love it

[2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:07.240]  it's like i got i got people putting out chinese propaganda
[2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:12.760]  in the united states they admit that facebook's run by the Wuhan deputy
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:15.880]  scientist i got nazi censoring my free speech
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:21.320]  i got a technocrat trying to inject the entire earth with a foreign substance
[2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:24.600]  in total medical tyranny i have democrat governor saying oh
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:28.040]  meanwhile there's probably like there's someone like wiggling in their seated
[2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:34.280]  media matters i mean this is like it's ridiculous
[2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:38.120]  it's ridiculous to know i i don't want to know what goes on behind
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:41.800]  oh but we have democrat governors that
[2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:45.400]  are openly admitting like oh yeah bill of rights i didn't what i don't look at
[2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:49.160]  that like no i don't know bill of right no persecution how good are you feeling

[2:24:56.440 --> 2:25:00.840]  because i feel the human awakening no i'm actually i am jealous i think about
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:03.480]  shaving my head no don't do that you have nicely actually i am a little
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:06.200]  jealous with those because there's a lot of work that goes with having a very
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:11.560]  jealous of that duck's ass but alex i'm a little worried
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:14.520]  not for because the american people are waking up we're seeing that what i'm
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.640]  what i'm worried about is what is the president doing why are we still
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:21.640]  dealing with these criminals and these no no i agree is trunk
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:25.320]  complicit because this is really become ridiculous and it's not about like i
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:28.280]  mean we could we could make that decision and pivot and say okay it's
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:30.680]  time for us to go after trump whether we think trump is the enemy or that's
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:33.800]  just the best way to win i don't think that i just like
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:36.840]  this has become ridiculous well it is ridiculous the amount of censorship is
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:40.040]  out of control i think china runs it yeah it's all
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:42.600]  form run it's it's act before you see we're
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:46.840]  facebook's blocking ap now no no alex alex if you and then the woman at the
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:50.120]  wuhan lab runs it who can make that's like
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:53.640]  excuse me where they pull the hat off and it's the bad guys like we've caught them
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:57.480]  it's like ridiculous if you were at war what would be one of the first things
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:00.040]  you would do your enemy you'd sabotage their communication
[2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:02.920]  you'd shut down the lines of communication you'd shut up the american
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:06.600]  people with a bunch of delusional dark all these
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:11.080]  jack dorsi and all these little nobodies man then you would poison the people oh
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:15.240]  okay oh we released oh accidentally the virus came out of the lab
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:18.200]  let's see they're all trying to cover it up now it's all about the cover up now
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:21.480]  but don't forget that literally if there was any leadership we could
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:24.520]  decapitate these people in like three hours i mean the military
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:27.480]  could just you send out a thousand assassins
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:30.840]  uh and and and go up for globalists that are known chi-com operatives and you
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:33.480]  just take control of the infrastructure hand it back to the people and i'm not
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:36.920]  a guy that like lust ever violence they're attacking us brother
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:39.800]  and and now they're gonna have a nuclear war it's like why are we letting them do
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:43.000]  this just stop them now start it's time to start
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:46.440]  putting people in jail it's time to start putting people in military
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:50.520]  tribes not engage in violence because we're winning politically that's why
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:53.560]  they want to overturn everything with this martial law but i'm just saying
[2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:56.920]  the head of harvard you know they're all chi-com agents
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:01.320]  and they're launching bio attacks on us and i'm telling trump and the pentagon
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:07.080]  do your job okay we're under dam attack do something now
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:10.200]  yeah i don't know what we're i mean we're waiting for here but you got har
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:13.800]  harvard chemistry professors and chairmen's
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:17.000]  trying to transfer biological material with chinese nationals
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.480]  and everybody else is sitting there in a bucket of piss scared to say all this
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:24.680]  why we're losing everything because we act like cowards
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:29.720]  america had the world through ideas because they knew we weren't cowards man
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:33.320]  but that's another silver lining stop it stop the damn cowardice
[2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:36.840]  holy hell that's another silver lining though is that the
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:40.760]  the winter warriors are being separated from the sunshine patriots right now
[2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:43.960]  the winter warriors are coming out the sunshine patriots are hiding in their
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:47.560]  hole and i mean not anything winter patriots are
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:51.560]  smart and want to live that's the people think winter
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:55.000]  winter soldiers are tough no we're not we're smart
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:59.480]  i don't want to live under lockdown and globalist pedophiles running everything
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:02.680]  we got freedom because we had people willing to stand up
[2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:07.240]  it's not some cool thing to stand up folks it's like getting oxygen when you
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:11.560]  get under water and this reopening in phases i'm not i'm
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:15.080]  not i'm not behind it oh and we cycle it and then we'll
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:18.920]  yeah apps watch you i mean and it's okay this is the new normal it's a good
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:21.480]  thing trump came out and said this is not the new normal that's good
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:24.120]  we'll play that clip when we come back and we'll get into your thought crime
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:26.840]  because imagine you're like yeah i'm gonna go out and exercise my right to a
[2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:31.080]  symbol you know like black folks did in the 1960s or whatever
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:33.640]  i used to sit on the left like imagine this is just that there was a virus back
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:37.000]  then when we wouldn't even end the segregation i mean it's just like
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.200]  it's just like you just literally everything stopped because there's a
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:42.840]  virus it's not even that deadly of a virus stop breathing
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:47.240]  actually because you can get the virus the virus yeah i guarantee you can't

[2:29:54.840 --> 2:29:58.680]  how do you put a people under house arrest how do you put them under siege
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:01.560]  well you tell them you're protecting them from a virus
[2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:05.960]  that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had china
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:09.240]  release to then take down the populist president
[2:30:09.240 --> 2:30:12.120]  and those pesky american people that have become too
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:16.440]  uppity bilma are even admitted man i hope we have a depression
[2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:20.680]  and now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media
[2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:23.960]  are gonna keep the country closed along with the
[2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:28.040]  help of the blue cities and blue states all the time blaming trump and
[2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:31.640]  capitalism and americanism for the depression it creates
[2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:35.880]  if america is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:39.800]  i'm not sitting here and i'm not taking it it's all the nanny state and the peer
[2:30:39.800 --> 2:30:42.920]  pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:46.680]  but that's not what they're doing they are pulling america up by its roots
[2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:50.840]  and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole
[2:30:50.840 --> 2:30:54.200]  world and committing millions of third world people to death
[2:30:54.200 --> 2:30:58.920]  authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay
[2:30:58.920 --> 2:31:03.560]  in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you can go it's called
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:07.320]  martial law it's called living in authoritarian country everybody knows
[2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:11.720]  that everybody understands that and the democrats have now shown their hands
[2:31:11.720 --> 2:31:15.560]  with the deep state saying we're gonna listen to fouchy and the world health
[2:31:15.560 --> 2:31:18.360]  organization who've done nothing but put out all this
[2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:22.040]  fakeness information so far we're not gonna listen to the president
[2:31:22.040 --> 2:31:25.960]  we're not gonna listen to congress but then all these other corporations
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:30.680]  are gonna work in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things
[2:31:30.680 --> 2:31:34.840]  shut down this is economic warfare and i know everybody understands that
[2:31:34.840 --> 2:31:38.600]  public with the president and others need to develop a plan
[2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:42.520]  to understand that this is a global corporate civil war
[2:31:42.520 --> 2:31:45.960]  and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny
[2:31:45.960 --> 2:31:50.520]  against our country by globalist forces only understanding
[2:31:50.520 --> 2:31:55.080]  the reality of the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it
[2:31:55.080 --> 2:31:58.680]  the america that we've known and loved the america that was the land of the free home
[2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:03.560]  of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is
[2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:07.800]  about domesticating us shutting us down and making us dependent on them
[2:32:07.800 --> 2:32:11.720]  the food shortages have begun the depression is going to be long and
[2:32:11.720 --> 2:32:15.000]  very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to even turn back
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:18.360]  trump tried to stop it but the mainstream media working with the trichoms
[2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:21.400]  blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else
[2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:25.960]  has to get prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the
[2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:29.960]  economic chaos it's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year

[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:30.760]  people let's ride folks they have told us that humans the problem
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:33.480]  were hurting the earth the only way to stop the spread of
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:38.520]  covid-19 is to stop breathing so to save others you're a democrat
[2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:41.880]  globalist lord roth child hillary clinton
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:46.360]  rock obama i wish no harm upon you myself you want to abort the babies
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:50.200]  you said there's too many people you can get an electrical wire a rope
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:54.680]  go to the hardware store whatever and just tie it around the ceiling fan
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:33:58.680]  get a chair up there put it around your neck and then just kind of wiggle off
[2:33:58.680 --> 2:34:02.040]  there you kind of get that that breaks what happens real quick kind of break
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:05.880]  the neck real fast and then you won't be spreading covid-19 now
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:08.840]  now i i'm not asking you to do that i hope you have long lives
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:12.120]  i'm just saying you've told us how there's too many of us i need to die
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:17.000]  show us your leaders and leadership means you have to show us
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:21.080]  how to do it so i think hillary and and and lord roth child
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:25.880]  and all those people they said there's too many of us and their leaders
[2:34:25.880 --> 2:34:30.120]  they should show us how to how to kill ourselves well i mean for other people
[2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:34.040]  it may be as simple as just you know well they're for a citizen's suicide
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:36.920]  well i'm just saying if you want to stop the spread i mean we can do it right
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:39.880]  now alex we may ask us who would help them
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:43.960]  maybe i'm not just put gasoline on them i'm not even going to take a deep breath
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:46.920]  i'm just going to stop breathing because i want to be a leader i want to stop
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:50.280]  the spread it's all about let's do it let's do it i want the crew as well i'm
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:55.320]  obama okay and you're hillary let's just
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:58.520]  now of course we do have a silence alarm little hit so we should probably play
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:00.920]  some music under this for the stations get mad
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:03.960]  maybe like something like you would get in a funeral yep it's kind of getting
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:10.440]  harder but i'm saving the earth right hold on
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:13.720]  a little like 30 seconds a little covid's coming out
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:16.760]  no but we joke around about this i saw like the headline like
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.440]  breathing spreads it well the obvious answer is not breathing
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:23.640]  i saved the world i'll tell you what i want to hear i'm saving the world
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:36.920]  hold on there you go thank you alex thank you for saving the planet alex
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:42.920]  anyways now seriously you know we could joke around about this all day here but
[2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:46.360]  no i want to thank you no i agree the left says the human should die i think
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:50.600]  you know like the average leftist should like there's a lot of empty farm
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:55.080]  equipment out there alex if you want a woodchipper turn it on jump right in
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:59.320]  alex you want to volunteer for such a heroic thing i mean you know you could
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:02.920]  just i mean i'm sure you with with the proper training i'm not saying you
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:05.480]  should do this but i'm saying if somebody wanted to be the hero with the
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:08.680]  proper training you could probably learn how to just get a line up of people
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:11.400]  and just you know put your get the headlock and then just
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:16.680]  and just like you know just ten in a row save the planet one at a time
[2:36:16.680 --> 2:36:21.000]  well but you would volunteer for something like that right well no like
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:24.760]  we've been told uh david ross scholars too many people well
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:27.560]  i think he should volunteer to pour gasoline all over himself and then
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:32.520]  line himself as a roman candle well if humans are the disease
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:36.440]  you know and you want to eradicate humans lead by example
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:40.760]  in fact a microsoft ad ought to be that lady that devil or spurs she pours
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:43.000]  gasoline on herself said like having kids blood or whatever
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.880]  and she goes for the earth i was like wow i might actually do that
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:51.240]  she might actually do that though she she might literally do that because see
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:55.800]  what they're doing is they want to cement her into like human history as
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:00.120]  like the first artist to be multi-dimensional or like a hologram
[2:37:00.120 --> 2:37:03.240]  permanently through time and so then kids in like the year
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:08.840]  2500 are like ooh marina abramovich a hero of art when she's a known well she
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:14.120]  should read gasoline then voluntarily it's an art project
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:17.480]  no i'm delighted well actually you know that she actually did do an art display
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.400]  one time where people literally tortured her
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:23.560]  physically oh yeah right i'm dead anyways let's let's just get back to what i
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:26.200]  was going to get to
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:30.280]  the media matters david brock
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:35.080]  um it has has has come out and you have been a very bad boy you wanted to
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:38.200]  exercise your free speech you're right of assembly of the first amendment and
[2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:40.440]  they they said you're banned off twitter everywhere
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:42.760]  you committed a thought crime for what's coming up this saturday tell us about
[2:37:42.760 --> 2:37:45.720]  the the thought crime you committed well this is incredible because you wanted
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:49.400]  to break martial law and i mean come on america is about you don't leave your
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:52.680]  house folks come on no that's true i was a lot of radical lovers i was a bad
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:56.680]  american and i didn't want to shut america down and crash our can economy
[2:37:56.680 --> 2:38:00.280]  and destroy america forever i decided that i wanted america to live this is a
[2:38:00.280 --> 2:38:02.200]  really good photo of you though media matters god
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:05.880]  they had to you know it's sad that these people follow everything we do but
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:08.440]  that's that's another let's look at you right here
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:12.520]  this is a very good photo i asked them to get me from my good side
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:16.040]  but that's what they should look like a carp trying to get air
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:19.320]  well see that's that's actually what i look like when i see i wasn't breathing
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:21.800]  when i was doing this live stream because i'm trying not i'm trying to stop the
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:25.480]  spread because that was after about two minutes of not breathing and i started
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:28.760]  you know you start gasping for air like a carp out of water
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:33.960]  it's tough out no but seriously so people all over america are deciding it's
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:37.480]  time to reopen the country and but i don't even like saying that and i'm
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:39.880]  glad that when i was talking with daria she's like don't even go with that they
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:43.400]  can't close america so we decided to call saturday's rally you can't close
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:46.680]  america so that doesn't give them the precedent to say
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:50.040]  well we already closed it so you got to reopen it no you never closed it we
[2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:54.760]  voluntarily stayed inside with some bad america never shut down
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:58.120]  america never shut down and trump said it to the uh yesterday said america
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:00.680]  cooperated no that's it you gotta play that clip
[2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:05.000]  because here's like this gaggleings and then normal is drones deliver this food
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:11.560]  hey by the way uh what do you think in america just stands by forever
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:14.920]  part of the guidance seems to sort of shift to states and
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.200]  and companies the burden not just of of additional testing and surveillance but
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:24.120]  also the sort of new normal on which you know there's
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:28.600]  smaller crowds and restaurants and bars and that's not going to be normal
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:33.000]  there's not going to be a new normal where somebody has been having for 25 years
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:38.520]  158 seats in a restaurant and now he's got 30 or he's got 60
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:42.120]  because that wouldn't work that's not normal no normal will be if he has the
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:45.640]  158 or 68 seats and that's going to happen
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:49.000]  and it's going to happen relatively quickly we hope
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:53.240]  but that's our normal our normal is if you have 100 000 people in
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:57.720]  an alabama football game or 110 000 to be exact
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:01.160]  we want 110 000 people that we want every seat occupied
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:05.560]  normal is not going to be where you have a game with 50 000 people
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:09.720]  so literally china is open for business it's this thing where
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:14.040]  if somebody has a virus we never go outside again talk about a cult i mean
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:19.000]  this is so ridiculously obvious and the whole facade is starting to break down
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.680]  well the wet markets are even open in china but they'll alex they're going to
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:25.560]  use a kitty cat they'll still a little kitty i'm like i'm
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:28.280]  hungry today they will throw i'll take two kittens
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:31.640]  they'll throw anything that is alive into a hot
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:35.960]  boiling pot of water that is boiled probably 10 live animals previously to
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:41.800]  your that is fine chinese cuisine you racist
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:46.920]  no but seriously alex people don't know you speak fluent
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:52.680]  Mandarin well no that's the thing is that
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:55.720]  it came out of there it's admitted now we're not supposed to say it
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:58.680]  but they're using here's what i'm saying i'll get back to the censorship they're
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:02.440]  using coronavirus as an excuse it's not about coronavirus it's not about
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:05.880]  obviously it's not about that but what about
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:10.280]  congress should act that twitter says they're trying to
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:13.640]  organize to have protests those aren't allowed in america
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:17.960]  what happened to freedom of assembly all your bs doesn't trump that this is
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:21.800]  insane how they just push the president and the president out
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:24.760]  further and further look at that so by the way the event that they're trying to
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:27.880]  stop the american freedom that they're trying to stop is this
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:32.600]  saturday noon at the state capitol in austin texas and alex when i when i
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:36.200]  first announced this it was really just in response to what i saw in
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:39.400]  ohio and michigan and north carolina i didn't really know it was going to
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:43.640]  become a nationwide phenomenon and then other groups here locally other
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:47.320]  groups in san antonio other it's spontaneous and it's just it's just
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:51.000]  synchronicity and so we're going to have our people out here there's going to be
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.720]  all kinds of other groups out there i think by the way though the governor of
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:56.440]  michigan said it was racist because they said she's a nazi
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:00.200]  she goes oh look they're nazis they said i'm a nazi but she thinks people are so
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:04.120]  illiterate that if we're calling her a nazi we're nazis well wait a second she's
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:07.800]  the governor that betrayed her own democrat
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:12.200]  representative and and who would have died if it wasn't for trump getting the
[2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:15.880]  hydroxychloroquine out there as far as it doesn't matter i'll call you racist
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:19.560]  right now why are you a nazi right now i like it i can't beat that that's it
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:22.440]  that's it for me why i'll kill her huh well thanks for having me alex yeah
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:26.200]  exactly let me you like Hitler huh save the

[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:31.800]  is that how you save on there

[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:14.680]  for 26 years alex jones and info wars
[2:44:14.680 --> 2:44:18.920]  have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide

[2:44:55.880 --> 2:44:59.560]  well communist china wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:04.200]  cut their energy used by half and the odd states wouldn't sign on to it
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:07.480]  so guess what happened along came covet 19
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:11.480]  and bill gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:16.120]  by half and that means you're gonna be poor now and under his control and of
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:19.640]  course with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations

[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:28.760]  and bill gates admits that 700 000 people will get sick and die from it
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:32.760]  so remember folks they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your

[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:04.280]  in our history this is the worst employment collapse in us history by a
[2:46:04.280 --> 2:46:07.560]  very wide margin writes michael snider's economic
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:11.400]  collapse block at this point we should no longer speak of economic
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:14.280]  collapse as something that will happen in the future
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:17.880]  it is now here and he does an excellent job
[2:46:17.880 --> 2:46:21.880]  in the article on info wars dot com of laying it out this was done
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:25.240]  by design trump fought to open the economy
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:30.440]  but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricombs and with hollywood
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:34.760]  and the media held america underwater until we sucked it into our
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:38.920]  lungs and now we're lying there like a fish dying
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:42.680]  there's not much time to get the water out of our lungs so remember for decades
[2:46:42.680 --> 2:46:46.280]  to come when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:51.720]  with no medicine the globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:55.640]  did this the globalist did this
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:02.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:07.720 --> 2:47:14.120]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:21.080]  sweet dreams are made of these who am i to disagree

[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:42.840]  he was saying terrible things about the globalist
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:50.440]  and then he finally got reason and he said it's time for all of us to die
[2:47:50.440 --> 2:47:54.600]  to stop covet 19 spread on to un said you have to stop breathing
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:58.360]  so i don't just believe we shall be given masks i believe they should set up

[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:19.800]  this looks too natural it actually is very natural right now

[2:51:24.120 --> 2:51:28.680]  look at how much look at how much age you lost alex i was like a baby digitally
[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:35.480]  uploaded now let's get serious though
[2:51:35.480 --> 2:51:38.520]  things are getting really hardcore oh and you have a demonstration tomorrow that
[2:51:38.520 --> 2:51:43.720]  you were grievously punished for uh we can joke around about this
[2:51:43.720 --> 2:51:48.680]  because we take things you know to we take things on the channel too easily
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:53.160]  it really what i learned last night that you and a bunch of the crew members
[2:51:53.160 --> 2:51:55.880]  were banned off twitter and they said because you're
[2:51:55.880 --> 2:52:01.000]  going to violate social distancing um imagine that level of tyranny where
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:06.280]  where due process and where before you even did it an off
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:13.800]  platform activity and the right to assemble and basic
[2:52:13.800 --> 2:52:16.840]  the first amendment gone and it's all being overseen
[2:52:16.840 --> 2:52:19.800]  by the same tech companies that help police the chinese people
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:23.720]  this is a crime against humanity this is war crimes well where are
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:27.160]  the you know what you're talking about real men but where are just americans
[2:52:27.160 --> 2:52:30.120]  where are the real men where are the real women that are sitting here and just
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:33.320]  seeing this at its face value and saying wait a second
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:37.240]  you can't tell us to close our business you can't tell us to end our way of life
[2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:40.760]  you can't tell us to stay inside you can't do this to us you can't
[2:52:40.760 --> 2:52:44.520]  threaten us us with fines you can't threaten us with arrests if we choose
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:49.800]  to open our business especially when you gave the bio weapon of the chinese
[2:52:49.800 --> 2:52:55.480]  released it it's confirmed now and the people that released it are our bosses
[2:52:55.480 --> 2:52:58.680]  i mean let me tell you i trust trump because i know what he's gone through
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:01.480]  if it was a real bio weapon got out or something happened and it was like
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:04.360]  killing five percent ten percent they're like hey man i want to see him
[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:07.640]  bodies pollen for real and it wasn't all fake stuff and trumps like hey i need
[2:53:07.640 --> 2:53:11.720]  you to do this it's like two weeks emergency i i would trust him he's been
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:14.360]  against it from the beginning yeah then they jumped on him and said you're
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:17.080]  going to cause mass deaths so he had because of our
[2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:20.200]  calendars i don't mean you're as out of the general public's
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:24.280]  he had to try to ride the tiger now he's been trying to reopen things
[2:53:24.280 --> 2:53:27.960]  and again the very same media praising ggp as attacking trump
[2:53:27.960 --> 2:53:31.720]  america better sabbath your president man you better sabbath your president
[2:53:31.720 --> 2:53:36.120]  right now well and and it's really just side with reality side with your own
[2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:39.560]  personal freedom because i think another reason why they want to stop
[2:53:39.560 --> 2:53:42.600]  these uh you know rallies and exhibitions at
[2:53:42.600 --> 2:53:45.400]  state capitol and stuff because guess what alex this is our way of kind of
[2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:48.840]  testing the system too like all right we're all going to go to this we're not
[2:53:48.840 --> 2:53:52.120]  most people aren't wearing masks they're shaking hands are we going to be all
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:54.760]  right most people are probably going to go home and look in the mirror about a
[2:53:54.760 --> 2:53:56.760]  month later and still be healthy and say you know what
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:54:03.160]  dude nine people have died and eight up more over 80 years old and that's
[2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:08.280]  with a fake test that counts every cold virus is that yeah and it's a hoax
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:12.680]  and folks i knew with china shutting down and what was coming i said you better
[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:15.480]  get ready you better boost your immune system you better get food for the economy
[2:54:15.480 --> 2:54:18.680]  shutting now and you should normally have your immune system boosted anyways i'm
[2:54:18.680 --> 2:54:22.040]  very glad to get folks to get vitamins and minerals they need plus it funds
[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:25.000]  the operation i'm totally transparent but
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.120]  speak of this i haven't even really plugged today we have a new product in
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:31.400]  ladies and gentlemen let me tell you about this
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:35.800]  this was planned six months ago before this even started
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:40.200]  i said you know there are all these hand sanitizers
[2:54:40.200 --> 2:54:44.200]  that are toxic and have problems we have it with high quality organic
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:48.760]  alcohol and with essential oils in three different
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:54.920]  scents lavender and we also have look you
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:54:58.680]  eucalyptus and we have the other one and we also have peppermint
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:03.240]  all of these evil terrorists you can get all three of them together
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:06.520]  for 50 off or get them together individually but
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:11.080]  no one has that we've looked at an organic
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:14.760]  hand sanitizer that actually leaves your hands
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:18.280]  not oily but not dry it leaves them healthy
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:22.440]  and i said about six months ago looking at the market and i said what's really
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:26.280]  hot well hand sanitizer and i'm like yeah hand sanitizer on average is really
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:30.360]  toxic lowest fertility studies are out there i said i want a natural hand
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:33.960]  sanitizer so that's how god works that right as they try to block us putting
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:37.880]  out major products this baby six months in development is here
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:41.320]  we have a limited amount only a few thousand bottles of each one
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:43.720]  and we won't get more for a couple months but this is how you fund the
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:47.480]  operation plus this stuff is amazing info or store
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:51.960]  dot com we have it in lavender we have it in peppermint and we
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:55.400]  have it in eucalyptus which is one of my favorites at info or
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:59.320]  store dot com it's so good just for your
[2:55:59.320 --> 2:56:05.960]  nose just for your brain to smell it like this is olfactory nerve
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:08.680]  you know the sense of conspiracy the olfactory nerve doesn't exist yes it
[2:56:08.680 --> 2:56:11.320]  does you know like i said we have storeable food they're gonna probably
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:14.120]  say you don't need food to live you know the FDA says it's not
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:17.400]  non-essential you know like your job your life is non-essential i'm not even
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:21.080]  joking they say they're already saying it's weird if you claim vaginal birth
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:23.240]  is normal i predicted that 20 years ago they're now
[2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:26.920]  saying vaginal birth should be illegal okay and and you know
[2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:30.280]  because again ladies and gentlemen it's a takeover of the normal
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.520]  human biology it is it is a tyranny it is a domestication so
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.640]  we have these at info or store dot com and you know i'm even worried about
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:43.720]  bringing the money in at this point except i forget how serious things are
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:46.280]  and then i remember that i should tell you these are great products that you
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:48.680]  already it's just that things are insane so get your
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:52.520]  storeable food back in stock get your hand sanitizers with natural
[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:55.480]  essential oils and info or store dot com where you still can oh and what do you
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:56:58.440]  have coming up in the war room today well let me just say i will be definitely
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:02.440]  talking about these new hand sanitizers because most of the time you know you
[2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:05.160]  first of all you can't even find any but normally you know you try to squeeze it
[2:57:05.160 --> 2:57:08.680]  right and the whole like glob comes out and then you have too much and then it's
[2:57:08.680 --> 2:57:11.240]  a mess this how has nobody done this before with a
[2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:13.640]  oh hey if they believe in what they're doing they'll
[2:57:13.640 --> 2:57:17.320]  buy the damn sanitizer this is a spray that matter we're all gonna burn in
[2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:21.080]  hell anyway how has nobody how has nobody developed a spray
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:24.440]  hand sanitizer until we did it that's just well we got some even we got some
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:27.240]  even cooler stuff coming out but no uh actually alex i really want to take a
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:30.680]  lot of phone calls i got a lot of great guests coming up today is too so you're
[2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:36.360]  gonna announce that you're gay today for brian stelter no for david brock
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:39.560]  you know i think that david brock david brock and i don't even talk about
[2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:43.480]  these losers anymore honestly they're just a lot actually they're not you know
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:47.080]  look the globalists are satanists all right
[2:57:47.080 --> 2:57:52.840]  war's wrath child recently posed at a gallery of art worshiping the devil
[2:57:52.840 --> 2:57:56.360]  and praising lucifer you cannot make this up
[2:57:56.360 --> 2:57:59.800]  they flaunt it in our face that's what environmentalism is it's about having
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:02.280]  an anti-human future and having people live in a
[2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:06.280]  subsistence futile served state that's what they want
[2:58:06.280 --> 2:58:10.120]  these people that have stolen the planet are worth trillions of dollars
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:13.560]  do not want you having a good life they know you're having fun
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.160]  they know you have a great wife a great husband great children they hate
[2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:21.080]  your guts they are the most horrible evil people on the planet
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:24.760]  they openly fund racism war degeneracy
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:28.840]  pedophilia everything else imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and
[2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:33.080]  then imagine it doubled tripled quadrupled and being gullible and being
[2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:36.600]  domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder
[2:58:36.600 --> 2:58:39.800]  and they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet and they are
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:44.360]  the enemy of humanity and need to be stood up against
[2:58:44.360 --> 2:58:52.840]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[2:59:14.360 --> 2:59:34.680]  to
[2:59:34.680 --> 2:59:34.840]  her
[2:59:38.440 --> 2:59:39.640]  nine
[2:59:39.640 --> 2:59:50.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:59:50.160 --> 3:00:09.620]  You know Alex they used to do career matches or retirement
[3:00:09.620 --> 3:00:14.520]  matches in the WWE I think you should have you should put your career on the
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:20.360]  line in a in a bare-knuckle brawl UFC style put your career on the line all
[3:00:20.360 --> 3:00:24.160]  these people that won Alex Jones shut down you have a lineup just you'll fight
[3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:27.680]  them all in a row do a Royal Rumble style and keep coming over the ropes and
[3:00:27.680 --> 3:00:31.640]  until one of them puts you out and that'll be it you put your career on the
[3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:35.440]  line all these people that won Alex Jones shut down you can actually end his
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:40.000]  career he'll put his career on the line I'm ready to fight would you do that
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:46.240]  proceeds go to charity let's be serious Owen that's the paradox is we get so
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:52.440]  close to absolute martial law paradoxically under massive threat I
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:56.120]  feel better than I've ever felt because I'm being true to myself and that's why
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:00:59.040]  people think like they're looking for fulfillment it's not about a car or a
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:04.960]  plane or a woman or a man or a big house freedom produces all that and then
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:08.160]  you're like it's it you're almost a shame you have it because you want to help
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:16.200]  others it's authenticity that's everything and right now seeing all
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:21.560]  this happen it's a paradox because I've got so much energy and I feel so good
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:25.520]  Owen and I look at people that are under this control living under this fear and
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:29.600]  they just don't understand it so how do we like Dr. Nick beggars coming up how
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:33.720]  do we get people out of fear because people say oh taking action is fear no
[3:01:33.720 --> 3:01:37.840]  that's not no that's the action is not fear action is actually changing things I
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:41.480]  try to tell them about the bad stuff happening because I believe they want
[3:01:41.480 --> 3:01:44.160]  to overpower it they asked me why are you trying to make me scared I'm like
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:47.480]  I'm trying to make you scared well if something bad's happening I want to know
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:52.720]  about it to fix it I think it's all about the winning psychology they they
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:56.480]  still have enough control over the censorship and over the mainstream
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:01.000]  entertainment that they still have the illusion of being the victorious team
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:05.160]  like oh yeah Bill Gates is still on top everybody supports Bill Gates no he's
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:09.680]  he's a total loser nobody can stand him literally everywhere you his name is it
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:13.800]  just nothing but hey so I think I think as soon as we turn that tide and I don't
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:17.080]  know what the the moment is or what the answer is or how it comes about but as
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:22.280]  soon as we turn that tide of winning psychology everybody's gonna want to be
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:25.740]  on the same team as info wars everybody's gonna want to be on the same
[3:02:25.740 --> 3:02:28.720]  team as Trump now those are just two names I put out there it's really just an
[3:02:28.720 --> 3:02:33.200]  idea it's just a cause but but these are just some of the names at the front so
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:36.400]  all those people that have been so brainwashed all those people that have
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:43.240]  been so slovenly all those people that have been so ignorant are they may not
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:46.600]  change in those ways but they're gonna hop onto the winning team because they
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:49.160]  see it's winning and they want to write it same reason why somebody wears a mask
[3:02:49.160 --> 3:02:52.720]  outside with their favorite team logo or you know somebody makes a mask their
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:55.760]  favorite color or with a pattern or something because it's like hey it's
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:02.800]  really not about for sure that bandwagon effect yeah my only thing is it's so
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:08.880]  ridiculously obvious now I mean it should be easier to beat this but hasn't
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:12.020]  it always been ridiculously obvious though I mean when you go back and you
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:14.800]  look at everything you've covered your documentaries everything we've been
[3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:18.400]  through it's always been obvious it's been obvious before we could even know
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:22.960]  what it was like you don't even you don't even have to know anything
[3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:26.680]  politically to look around the world and say what the hell I know I agree with
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:30.040]  you and it's not much to say this is Nick Beckins is here I remember like 25
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:32.920]  six years ago when I was first awake getting on air and he was like had
[3:03:32.920 --> 3:03:41.200]  documents and actual patents it does take scientifically doc creating the
[3:03:41.200 --> 3:03:45.120]  original text to like say okay there's a scientific elite they're building a
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:49.000]  world outside of us what are they building there's like a skeleton has to
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:53.440]  be there so as we can look at the public and say oh you didn't see this well we
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:56.600]  have to build the skeleton and they have to build the skeleton they have to
[3:03:56.600 --> 3:04:01.240]  believe in themselves and report on what they're seeing and then test that with
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:06.040]  their own human DNA about whether that's sound or not I mean I really think
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:08.960]  everyone has to be a leader now here's that we have to get the average person
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:11.620]  that doesn't think they're a leader to start thinking about being a leader
[3:04:11.620 --> 3:04:14.040]  under doesn't mean they're always gonna have the answer zone but it means they
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:18.720]  need to start thinking about they don't just report off what they receive that
[3:04:18.720 --> 3:04:21.720]  report from what comes within them and that's why you know people that own
[3:04:21.720 --> 3:04:25.560]  businesses and such just need to open your businesses in defiance of the
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:32.120]  tyrannical government but Alex I was gonna say I was gonna actually I was
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:34.440]  working on putting this out as a tweet but here's a perfect example of how
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:38.120]  obvious it's been but you can't wait you're 19 1942 the Nazis
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:44.480]  fluoridate the water they give the Jews 1945 the US hires Nazi scientists 1945
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:48.400]  the US begins fluoridating their water like there's your skeleton you still
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:52.240]  want to drink the fluoridated water folks I don't think so
[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:57.680]  it doesn't matter how hard I want to fight if others human beings don't
[3:04:57.680 --> 3:05:01.160]  resonate with what I'm saying you don't spread the word if you don't buy the
[3:05:01.160 --> 3:05:05.000]  products to fund our operation the dog doesn't hunt but you get that you are
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:09.400]  patriots you are people that live and work in the real world of a race color
[3:05:09.400 --> 3:05:12.240]  and create and understand what's happening and that's why when you call in
[3:05:12.240 --> 3:05:16.120]  and thank me for what I've done it's really a sick joke thank you for what
[3:05:16.120 --> 3:05:18.960]  you've done we're all of this together we believe in the rights of the
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:22.320]  unborn we believe in families we believe in the right to self-defense we
[3:05:22.320 --> 3:05:26.360]  believe in capitalism America and Jesus Christ number one and we believe in
[3:05:26.360 --> 3:05:31.120]  free speech and so the fact that you shopped with us and the fact that you
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:34.960]  spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world that's why
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:39.120]  I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought
[3:05:39.120 --> 3:05:42.080]  they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now they thought they'd be in charge
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:46.480]  they thought that would have won but they didn't count on you and I and others
[3:05:46.480 --> 3:05:50.360]  coming together so God bless you
[3:05:50.360 --> 3:06:13.960]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[3:06:21.320 --> 3:06:26.160]  ladies and gentlemen the very fight for the future of humanity is now that
[3:06:26.160 --> 3:06:30.120]  Nick Megan's about to take over and the hotter the show the more important the
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:33.680]  items the less I plug we do have high-quality swarming food that's
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:36.920]  available everybody needs to be self-sufficient you need to get your
[3:06:36.920 --> 3:06:39.800]  orders in now they had to suspend orders for a few weeks while they got caught up
[3:06:39.800 --> 3:06:43.040]  now they've got it other people are lying you would say oh seven days it
[3:06:43.040 --> 3:06:46.480]  ships and then they have people that line you on the phone oh it's coming it's
[3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:49.440]  coming we don't do that we tell you straight up it's available again with
[3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:53.040]  what's happening they want you dependent don't be dependent with the best
[3:06:53.040 --> 3:06:56.560]  verbal food the lowest prices you're gonna find at infowars store.com take
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:01.880]  advantage of that we have this new system where you can get one of the only
[3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:08.040]  essential oil organic hand sanitizers 50% off just came out I planned this six
[3:07:08.040 --> 3:07:11.480]  months ago before this all happened why is there an organic hand sanitizer it's
[3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:14.920]  got the alcohol in it but it's got the essential oils we have it in lavender we
[3:07:14.920 --> 3:07:20.520]  have it in peppermint and they have it of course also in eucalyptus and that's
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:24.000]  how we fund the operation vitamin mineral fusion has the zinc and so much
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:28.440]  more in it great for adults and children that's 50% off x3 is get ready to sell
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:32.600]  out it's still 60% off and it is your funding you know I sit there it's money
[3:07:32.600 --> 3:07:38.440]  that allows us to have all the lawyers to hold off the deep state and and stuff
[3:07:38.440 --> 3:07:42.400]  you don't even know about as long as possible and we weren't supposed to be on
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:48.200]  air by now and it's just been money just blasted at the enemy that's in your
[3:07:48.200 --> 3:07:52.440]  prayers that's you know held them back so believe me right now it's it's always
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:07:56.840]  been about the victory but but now more than ever with a gun to my head it is
[3:07:56.840 --> 3:08:00.560]  now a hundred percent I can't tell you about the stuff right now but you know
[3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:04.120]  let's just say they've had the carrot and then and then now they got the stick
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:10.480]  and and I'll get out and so that's where it is right now and the White House knows
[3:08:10.480 --> 3:08:14.560]  about it and the White House is just cut off they just think this day they can
[3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:17.280]  only put out main messages and that's about it there they're cut off as well
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:20.360]  most people have been threatened with indictment or arrest to support the
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:24.280]  president most people've rolled over I've not done it and I'm not a hero here
[3:08:24.280 --> 3:08:27.920]  not rolling over to folks I mean not rolling over to stuff like that is what
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:32.440]  I do I mean I would die the day I did that so I feel great actually in fact
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:36.200]  it's actually a distortion for me that I feel so good and not worried about
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:39.760]  anything I go hey you better get your act together you better be serious you
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:43.000]  better warn people right now instead of you know ago you've done such a good
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:46.960]  job and you've never backed down so you feel so good about yourself you know in
[3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:51.000]  your soul telling you great job great job I better actually get a little bit
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:54.680]  out of the souls I'm always too much in that and into the body and like go
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.680]  intellectually we better settle accounts here because Nick Beggus's dad
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:01.680]  wouldn't back off when he gave all that land to the Native Americans up there in
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:04.960]  Alaska they killed his ass and he tell you though his dad's strong though he's
[3:09:04.960 --> 3:09:09.400]  a real man and that's what the point where it is who are we for eternity take
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:16.000]  like braveheart and says imagine many years from now lying your beds wishing
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:19.120]  just want you to stood up on the right day they goes yeah fight against that
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:24.800]  fight we lose you know run we win no you die and so it's that spirit that
[3:09:24.800 --> 3:09:29.920]  builds everything in China in North Korea in all these places people roll over
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:34.840]  here we don't do that and we stand on those shoulders of people that didn't
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:38.760]  back down under threat because believe me before they killed Nick Beggus's dad
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:41.160]  I know it's personal for him I'm not belittling it just putting it off here
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:47.960]  as a common thing but we're in the same wheelhouse so I can say it I'm not
[3:09:47.960 --> 3:09:52.600]  belittling how people get killed for the truth I'm saying that's what brings the
[3:09:52.600 --> 3:09:57.720]  victory is people that don't back down in the final equation oh and final
[3:09:57.720 --> 3:10:00.960]  comment we'll have got a big baggage take over well that's kind of like a
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:04.920]  three-option solution you you have two options you can fight or you can run
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:09.640]  okay so you can fight and you can lose which is still a win you can fight and
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:13.560]  you can win which is a win you can run and you can win but you will always
[3:10:13.560 --> 3:10:17.840]  ultimately lose so fighting is always the best choice when it comes to that
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:22.240]  because victory comes with being in the arena and engaging in the fight so it's
[3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:26.760]  really exactly and you don't lose making the right spiritual decisions that's
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:31.400]  the that's like the highest level of success so I don't see getting killed
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:34.520]  or button present by this but I know I'm not afraid of it in fact almost have
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:38.200]  like a guilt that I'm ready I love my kids I love my wife and everything I'm
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:42.040]  like ready to ready to go if I need to and it's not like a power trip it's like
[3:10:42.040 --> 3:10:46.280]  I've passed the fear and and so then at that point like you're like you're not
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:49.320]  gonna give up you're not gonna back down you're gonna get more aggressive it's
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:52.400]  like yeah I am and they're gonna understand it well you have no choice
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:57.240]  it's it's momentum more than anything it's you know downhill momentum and
[3:10:57.240 --> 3:11:03.320]  exactly it's commitment and then at the point of the choice the commitment is
[3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:07.800]  there dr. Nick baggage we love you we appreciate you take over my friend hey
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:12.000]  thanks for having me it's always a pleasure you know I just to echo all
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  of that it's it's true you know it's you know it's it's like that agitation that
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:23.720]  you have to create sometimes just to wake people up and that's what info wars
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:27.880]  is about it's a little bit of agitation you know because you've got a prick of
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:32.240]  people's sensitivity just a bit so we're paying attention and that's what
[3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:38.360]  info wars is all about it has been about I want to talk about some of the
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:43.120]  dimensions of what's going on you know when you talk about the idea of control
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:49.440]  and and as Alex said just before coming on you know for 25 26 years we've been
[3:11:49.440 --> 3:11:55.480]  talking about this how's it gonna go how's it gonna come and and now it's here
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:12:00.320]  and info wars has always been on that cutting edge of information and that's
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:06.160]  why it's important to look at all of the alternatives and they're being shut
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:10.600]  down right now that's a dangerous a dangerous thing I know there's
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:15.040]  conservatives there's people listening from all political persuasions actually
[3:12:15.040 --> 3:12:19.080]  all around the world today to this program to what's happening in the
[3:12:19.080 --> 3:12:25.600]  world today and you know and again the challenge will be how do we stand up and
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:31.880]  face the adversary which is now so much in our face personal privacy the basis
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:38.440]  of liberty all of that is at stake in real terms right now and so it's a
[3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:44.160]  question of what do we want to do about it you know stand still or or act in an
[3:12:44.160 --> 3:12:50.280]  appropriate way you know I want to start kind of backfilling information that's
[3:12:50.280 --> 3:12:54.440]  kind of missing in a lot of the public dialogue away from the virus a little bit
[3:12:54.440 --> 3:12:58.640]  because that's kind of been covered a lot this week but getting in some of the
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:03.720]  ancillary issues one of the news feeds again earlier today on the oil and gas
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:10.840]  side wholesale price for gasoline in the upper Midwest 12 cents a gallon
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:15.560]  according to Bloomberg today think about that 12 cents a gallon and here's why
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:19.400]  and it's something I've been talking about here on info wars for over a year
[3:13:19.400 --> 3:13:25.760]  and it's the storage issues with both crude oil and now refined product because
[3:13:25.760 --> 3:13:31.280]  when you have a slack in demand as as radical as the one that's happening right
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:39.800]  now globally between oil for ships oil jet fuel for jets automobile gasoline and
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:43.800]  diesel for moving things around the planet it's just not being sold those
[3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:49.360]  are the refined products so where's the end storage tank beyond your gas tank it's
[3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:54.560]  at the gas station so here it is all that gasoline is now moving into gas
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:59.280]  stations filling up those pumps discounting like crazy but capacities
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:04.400]  gone basically being sucked up really quickly on the raw side the oil
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:10.320]  production side and I've been saying it for over a year is US source capacity is
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:15.440]  gone and has been gone and now global source capacity is quickly running out
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:21.040]  including tankers that are floating around full outside of ports waiting to
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:25.400]  unload but there's no place to put it so that's the state and you can't just
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:30.760]  shut it down remember it's a flow of product oils not like coal or minerals
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:35.600]  you can pile them up in a pile you got to keep it moving through foot refineries
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:39.520]  through the end user and in this case it's all shutting down now everyone's
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:44.960]  heard about the 10 million barrel a day cut well that's not taking place for a
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:49.360]  couple more weeks it's scheduled for May 1st from OPEC meanwhile they're
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:53.840]  discounting the hell out of their product and upping the quantity shipping
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:59.520]  and depressing the price even more now under $20 today around 18-19 bucks
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:05.160]  barrel last time I look now why is that all important we have the fracking
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:09.640]  industry that's being gutted by the price the banks that back the fracking
[3:15:09.640 --> 3:15:12.880]  industry a whole bunch of jobs surrounding it and then the mainstream
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:17.400]  oil industry here in Alaska conical Phillips few weeks ago announced $200
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:22.600]  million in reductions another $200 million in reductions announced
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:27.640]  yesterday in capital expenditures and they're just one of many cutting back
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:34.240]  on their expenditures because of oversupply and no demand the two worst
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:41.520]  situations both curves running away from each other in ever larger surpluses on

[3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:30.000]  and welcome back and it's a Friday afternoon and most of the country are
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:34.840]  still a little bit more noon here in anchorage Alaska and we were talking a
[3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:39.040]  little bit about the oil and gas situation just because it it has such a
[3:20:39.040 --> 3:20:44.560]  huge impact on various aspects of the country here in Alaska it is devastating
[3:20:44.560 --> 3:20:50.120]  what's happening right now two for two reasons one is we've completely lost our
[3:20:50.120 --> 3:20:57.920]  tourism industry as well as had a major impact on oil and gas and other forms of
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:21:03.760]  development here because we're essentially a raw resource state also
[3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:10.640]  before the break alex had mentioned a little bit about and you know talking
[3:21:10.640 --> 3:21:16.760]  about gates right you know why does he get such a negative back flash every
[3:21:16.760 --> 3:21:24.320]  time his name is quoted in articles and so so on I would venture this and I
[3:21:24.320 --> 3:21:28.640]  would put this out there because he's not elected he doesn't represent us no
[3:21:28.640 --> 3:21:33.640]  one chose him he chose himself and had a big checkbook to get in front of the
[3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:41.440]  public but nobody chose him to lead anything ever okay a shareholder did I
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:45.560]  guess at one point commercially I mean he did his thing with Microsoft whatever
[3:21:45.560 --> 3:21:50.040]  else he did but the point of the matter is that's kind of the rub for so many of
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:53.160]  us you know whether you're talking about the United Nations nobody elected
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:57.440]  anybody there either and they'd like to tell you what to do I resent that I
[3:21:57.440 --> 3:22:02.320]  resent that at a really deep level not the idea of people talking to each
[3:22:02.320 --> 3:22:07.040]  other nation sharing information all of that hey good good great I'm all for it
[3:22:07.040 --> 3:22:12.520]  I believe in dialogue but I don't believe is representation without a vote I don't
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:18.000]  believe in that okay that's why I support the paper ballot only not little
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:23.320]  things you punch out but things that you ink up with ink pens so that you can
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:27.280]  recount them later you know that's one thing that should never be automated
[3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:30.800]  that there ought to be a constitutional amendment because nobody ever
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:35.000]  anticipated there'd be a different way to do it but there ought to be a
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:40.320]  protection of the ballot is sacred to democrat democracies and republics where
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:47.520]  the voting actually matters like ours you know and so I think about that in the
[3:22:47.520 --> 3:22:53.600]  scope of things but also think about sort of what's going on the opposite is
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:22:57.640]  what this virus is being used for greater levels of political control
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:23:05.600]  something I've been talking about for years over the last week one of my
[3:23:05.600 --> 3:23:10.120]  business partners in Thailand sent me a document it was pretty interesting when
[3:23:10.120 --> 3:23:15.680]  I want to mention it today it's called scenarios of the future of technology
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:20.400]  and international development by the Rockefeller Foundation and the GBN
[3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:26.240]  global business network there it is for those of you that have a screen today
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:31.120]  yeah I can figure out where it is somebody found a good great thanks guys
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:34.880]  in any case this thing was put together by the Rockefeller Foundation and I
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:39.960]  read it and a couple things caught me that I had not noted before one is
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:45.280]  when was the Rockefeller Foundation the big one of the biggest nonprofits ever
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:51.600]  formed 1913 now isn't that really interesting because that's the same year
[3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:57.480]  that they created the income tax which to remind listeners in the 1890s was
[3:23:57.480 --> 3:24:02.600]  ruled by the US Supreme Court unconstitutional and likened to slavery
[3:24:02.600 --> 3:24:07.640]  because you couldn't tax a person's labor that was not possible until we had
[3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:13.120]  the amendment to the Constitution in 1913 that created the income tax and it
[3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:16.880]  also created all kinds of things including nonprofits so companies who
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:21.400]  were gonna get taxed now like the Rockefellers could transfer huge chunks
[3:24:21.400 --> 3:24:25.160]  of their wealth because after a certain point I mean how much money do you need
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:29.760]  really and the modern guys do the same thing the Gates and the other guys
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:35.360]  people with big money they move it to big nonprofits now nobody gets taxed but
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:40.360]  do you think those billion dollar plus funds don't have influence it has the
[3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:46.160]  Clinton Foundation or the Obama Foundation or the Bush Foundation or you
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:49.600]  know the Gates Foundation or any other Foundation what is it what do they hope
[3:24:49.600 --> 3:24:55.720]  to gain and you could say well they're benevolent well perhaps so and I'm
[3:24:55.720 --> 3:25:00.240]  sure in their view they are but how people act and what they do tells you
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:05.640]  more than everything else right so measure against performance but more
[3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:10.160]  importantly I don't like and I think a lot of us don't like people telling us
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:16.320]  what to do that we don't elect appropriately to do that or they don't
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:20.720]  get appointed by people that are elected and this is kind of ridiculous the UN
[3:25:20.720 --> 3:25:24.840]  side of it is way too powerful from my perspective so is the World Health
[3:25:24.840 --> 3:25:29.120]  Organization and they can't even tell anyone what to do obviously unless they're
[3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:32.600]  given a script from China and that was not from Trump that was from the vice
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:38.720]  premier of Japan who called it the Chinese Health Organization so as all
[3:25:38.720 --> 3:25:43.520]  these things happen now looking at that Rockefeller report why else is that
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:49.040]  important well this was a narrative a fictional narrative right I mean these
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:52.520]  were scenarios that were dreamed up and I'm looking for the right page here
[3:25:52.520 --> 3:25:57.080]  because I'm gonna just read it because I mean you can't make this stuff up folks
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:00.920]  I mean it's too crazy you know and that and when you read it and you go who's
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:07.840]  who wrote this you know it was it was the Rockefeller Foundation and so what
[3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:12.720]  do they what do they say and so here's a let me just read it and this is
[3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:20.480]  fictional remember this was written in fact ten years ago May 2010 ten years
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:25.280]  ago okay and here's what it says even the most pandemic prepared nations were
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:29.160]  quickly overwhelmed when the virus streaked around the world infecting
[3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:33.280]  nearly 20% of global population and killing eight million in just seven
[3:26:33.280 --> 3:26:37.760]  months the majority of them were healthy young adults the pandemic also had a
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:42.000]  deadly effect on economies international ability of both people and
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:47.560]  goods screech to a halt debilitating industries like tourism and breaking the
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:52.160]  global supply chains even locally normally bustling shops and office
[3:26:52.160 --> 3:26:57.960]  building sat in for months devoid of both employees and customers the pandemic
[3:26:57.960 --> 3:27:01.480]  blanketed the planet though disproportionate numbers died in
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:05.560]  Africa Southeast Asia and Central America the virus spread like wildfire in the
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:10.600]  absence of official containment protocols but even in developed countries
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:14.600]  containment was challenged the United States initial policy of strongly
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:19.600]  discouraging citizens from flying prove deadly in its leniency accelerating
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:24.880]  the spread of the virus not just within the US but across borders however a few
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:32.360]  countries did far better China in particular the Chinese government quick
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:40.400]  to impose mandatory quarantine in all citizens as well as an instant and near
[3:27:40.400 --> 3:27:45.440]  hermetic sealing off of all borders saved millions of lives stopping the
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:57.800]  spread of the virus far earlier think about that ladies and gentlemen think
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:03.800]  about that written 10 years ago as a prelude to where we're at today another
[3:28:03.800 --> 3:28:09.240]  book I referenced last week was out of the blue by John Peterson who runs the
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:14.400]  Arlington Institute he predicted pandemic 2 and then what would come from it and
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:19.200]  what would come from it from both of these guys a more directed and controlled
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:24.040]  society they were predicting this 10 years ago Rockefeller Foundation in
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.960]  partnership with Gates and other foundations including John Hopkins are
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:33.840]  running the meters today were they responsible or are they taking advantage
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:39.000]  I can assure you they're taking advantage of the opportunity regardless of how it
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:43.920]  began because these guys are opportunistic they look for this and take
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:47.880]  advantage of this to the detriment of every living soul we'll be right back

[3:32:06.280 --> 3:32:11.640]  that love to grovel those that love to be subservient those that love to
[3:32:11.640 --> 3:32:17.880]  apply and think that it's a virtue they create stagnation corruption tyranny and
[3:32:17.880 --> 3:32:25.040]  then finally collapse and the world is now being tested and we're seeing lots
[3:32:25.040 --> 3:32:30.440]  of dutiful individuals who've complied submitted their whole lives believing if
[3:32:30.440 --> 3:32:34.720]  they just submit now in a bigger way somehow they'll create a heavenly
[3:32:34.720 --> 3:32:40.920]  future but the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and
[3:32:40.920 --> 3:32:47.160]  anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future submission
[3:32:47.160 --> 3:32:53.480]  to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing into the ocean
[3:32:53.480 --> 3:33:15.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[3:33:15.040 --> 3:33:25.200]  worldwide it's Nick baggage you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[3:33:25.200 --> 3:33:29.680]  welcome back and you know I think it about you know just the whole team you
[3:33:29.680 --> 3:33:34.080]  know we've all got a lot going on and there's always a lot of stress them all
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:40.000]  of this and you know you got to sound the alarm you know some people you know
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:44.360]  get a little more excited than others but that's the beauty of import wars it's
[3:33:44.360 --> 3:33:48.280]  about information and we all have different delivery systems to get the
[3:33:48.280 --> 3:33:54.720]  word out and I appreciate everyone in import wars and on the team here it's
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:34:00.440]  been great the last week you know talking about Alex you know yeah you
[3:34:00.440 --> 3:34:05.600]  know you fear the empathy the depth of the empathy that we all feel for what's
[3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:10.000]  going on in the world but at the same time you're energized I mean because you
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:14.880]  got work to do you've got a mission to accomplish you know so it is a kind of a
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:20.760]  paradox it always has been for those that saw it coming you know how do you
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:26.360]  maintain a sense of joy in this when you see what's coming you do because you
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:33.000]  know how the story ends and and so that works out but but having said all that
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  getting back to what we were talking about a little bit before the break but
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:39.520]  where I wanted to go with this I started a little bit with oil I started a
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:43.200]  little bit with kind of dealing with that whole New World Order structure that
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:47.240]  we've got going on around us but really what I want to talk about and again pick
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:50.840]  up a little bit of where Alex left off he talked a little bit about Alaska and
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:56.920]  my family's heritage here and this is the great hope of the nation you see
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:02.160]  because we are the Treasury of the nation we are about 18% of the landmass we
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:06.880]  have more coastline than the East Coast Gulf Coast and West Coast of the United
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:12.600]  States combined in a 200 mile federal limit extending beyond the three mile
[3:35:12.600 --> 3:35:19.120]  state a jurisdictional limit on all waters off Alaska that's tremendous amount
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:24.040]  of resource now let me tell you about that resource there's 700,000 people
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:30.920]  more or less that live here let me say that again 700,000 people living in a
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:38.120]  country with 350 million and we're 18% or about a fifth of the landmass is crazy
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:44.760]  right and and yet here's what we have here this is Alex was always mentioned
[3:35:44.760 --> 3:35:49.240]  my dad's work on the native land claim settlement act and there's always a lot
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:55.440]  to say about that that particular act go I got to go back in time I got to go
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:35:58.360]  back in history and I'm going to give you that history because important part
[3:35:58.360 --> 3:36:02.720]  of our nation system most people don't know and again it's one-fifth of the
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:06.480]  game when you think of the landmass you know what we hold in common at the
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:13.360]  public treasury if you will and the lack of development here is an embarrassment
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:18.000]  as multinationals have used this as sort of a sewer house and the method of
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:22.560]  storing it is to lock it up in parks preserves and other federal restrictions
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:26.800]  that continue to extend into our state to the point where it strangles us and
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:31.280]  every environmental organization the world uses Alaska's the poster child
[3:36:31.280 --> 3:36:37.120]  for fundraising events which is totally screws us over here but it also screws
[3:36:37.120 --> 3:36:43.040]  over every single American because we're denied the opportunity to produce the
[3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:48.000]  nation's wealth you know this is the wealth of the nation it's not fee on
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  fiat currency being run on a printing press by the by 300 member banks of the
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:59.440]  Federal Reserve that's not how it goes it's real wealth here and that real
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:03.960]  wealth that the multinationals call this their safety deposit they just
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:08.920]  stow it all here they can twist all of our arms about how horrible and terrible
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:14.240]  it is to develop in the United States and so they chisel us down to nothing in
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:18.560]  a tax take and then they go X elsewhere in the third world where they bribe and
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:23.320]  exploit resource producers oh I shouldn't say bribe I guess make
[3:37:23.320 --> 3:37:28.520]  contributions to their political efforts and nonprofits in those countries that
[3:37:28.520 --> 3:37:34.080]  are owned by G government family members and all kinds of people connect to the
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:37.920]  government that's how it works you see but in those countries revolutions come
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:42.000]  and go and people get shoved into barrels and chunks and pieces and floated
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:47.960]  down rivers in America we're politically safe so someday they come back but by
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:54.560]  then you know what's left here it's time to develop our own resources in our
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:59.000]  national interests and encourage that kind of development and not discourage
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:02.920]  it and start thinking about what do we have and how do we do that how do we do
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:07.520]  that before we did it with infrastructure starting with transportation the great
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:13.320]  railroads transcontinental railroads and then later the interstate system and
[3:38:13.320 --> 3:38:16.920]  then the regional railroads that went along with that development before the
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:22.560]  interstate system and then we had a way to move goods and then the ports that
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:27.480]  allowed us to move goods in and out but you know one thing we didn't contemplate
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:35.520]  is having to travel between US ports in the way that we do now and so there are
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:40.520]  certain things within legislation that absolutely strangle Alaska's natural
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:45.080]  resources coming in by ship at least into the United States the rest of the
[3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:49.040]  United States and that's unfortunate it's called the Jones Act which increases
[3:38:49.040 --> 3:38:54.680]  the shipping cost tenfold because it requires US flag vessels to go US port
[3:38:54.680 --> 3:38:59.960]  to US port you can go foreign port to US port US port form port no problem
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:06.040]  foreign bag vessel so a Chinese vessel can come from China to San Francisco and
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:11.800]  deliver a cargo for ten cents on the dollar compared to how much it costs to
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:17.960]  ship it halfway back to China and drop it off in Hawaii okay because that's a
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:22.760]  US port to US port got to use US flag vessel and it costs ten times as much
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:27.080]  so you know these are things that most people aren't aware of but they do they
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:32.680]  cost us all dearly think about shipping oil from Alaska to US ports the same
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:37.280]  equation happens when you think about super tankers and their costs and how the
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:41.640]  cost of shipping figures into the cost of oil has landed at the refinery and
[3:39:41.640 --> 3:39:46.960]  then landed at the gas station transportation all figures in so you
[3:39:46.960 --> 3:39:52.200]  know we have we have all of that to think about in this context of what is
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:58.440]  Alaska off well Tidewater in Southeast Alaska company Eucor and by way of
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:04.520]  disclosure I have some shares there but Eucor is a rare earth company and rare
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:10.200]  earth metals currently are produced predominantly in China and a little bit
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:14.320]  in Russia but we have no domestic prediction and these are critical to
[3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:21.080]  every major industry in the modern world today and so we have it Tidewater the
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:25.640]  ability to produce these rare earth minerals and that's going to go into
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:30.240]  production you'll see it in the next couple years another mineral deposit
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:36.640]  Constantin owned by DOWO 49% domestically by others cold mines operating
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:42.560]  now in Alaska Donlan Creek North is getting ready to do some things but
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:46.480]  there's a lot going on in Alaska that most people don't pay attention to and
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:51.280]  we don't have a rail link you know to link us up to the Canadian rail system
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:55.880]  which would then allow us to move commodities into the Midwest into the
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:59.400]  Rust fell where value can be at in the United States and the Jones Act not be
[3:40:59.400 --> 3:41:03.760]  a problem and you can still protect US shipping with Jones Act not have to make
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:08.120]  a modification for Alaska but get us a railroad at least you know how about a
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:12.400]  super infrastructure project get American labor to work hook us up with a
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:16.760]  railroad so we can get some of the stuff moving south and then to expand that
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:21.000]  railroad to the southern flank the Brooks range all the way to Nome look at
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:25.280]  the historic maps of where rail was supposed to be and let's build rail to
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:30.120]  riches as a national program in America again and build the infrastructure that
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:34.160]  we need to put America back to work because the one thing all this taught
[3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:39.600]  us is supply chain needs to come home and that starts with raw materials raw
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:45.360]  resources producing them here adding value here and then buying them here
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:50.120]  keeping that working within our economy not to say that your foreign trade is
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:54.800]  dead but we need to rethink the critical elements of our trade to make sure
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:58.920]  American industry is equipped and capable of producing and Alaska is a
[3:41:58.920 --> 3:42:03.920]  missed resource and a neglected resources time when people need to again
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:10.160]  turn your heads north and pay attention to this region this is a major major
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:14.000]  issue you know when I come back from the break I want to talk about a bit of the
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:18.480]  indigenous issues and how those form how Alaska became a state what happened
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:24.200]  before and how we've been as an extractive region and why this is such an
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:28.680]  important region for the nation in terms of our national wealth you know when you
[3:42:28.680 --> 3:42:32.680]  think of national wealth remember it's four things it's entrepreneurship it's
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:37.520]  labor it's land and natural resources lastly it's factories that make things
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:42.080]  even a shovel that digs a ditch and those are the things that are real wealth
[3:42:42.080 --> 3:42:46.120]  not fiat currency let's talk about the national treasury the national wealth
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:51.800]  the national resource base we'll be right back this is Nick there's a
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:42:56.240]  process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:43:00.240]  off and then he becomes gelded well that's what's happening to the entire
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:04.200]  world right now we're going into deep deep tyranny places like North Korea and
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:07.880]  China are going into deeper tearing as well it's all directed by the UN it's
[3:43:07.880 --> 3:43:12.560]  all a big cooked up giant plan to absolutely take control of your life
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:16.520]  bankrupt the economy and make you dependent on the big mega banks and to
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:20.960]  get your universal income you're gonna have to take the inoculations brain
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:23.880]  wash your kids the way they say and have absolutely no freedom and it's all
[3:43:23.880 --> 3:43:28.320]  happening boom overnight this is a giant revolution and as soon as you put the
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:31.680]  handcuffs on they said oh it's just an extended spring break two weeks notice
[3:43:31.680 --> 3:43:36.400]  now it's 18 months two years five years it never ends no one can ever die from a
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:41.520]  virus again government will save you it's a takeover it's the opposite they're
[3:43:41.520 --> 3:43:45.560]  coming with forced inoculations on record they'll reduce your fertility lower
[3:43:45.560 --> 3:43:49.920]  your immunity and in many cases kill you and they're telling you it's gonna hurt
[3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:55.040]  a lot of people the official numbers are now in the United States is in the
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:59.760]  biggest financial collapse in our history this is the worst employment
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:04.520]  collapse in US history by a very wide margin writes Michael Snyder economic
[3:44:04.520 --> 3:44:08.840]  collapse block at this point we should no longer speak of economic collapse as
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:14.320]  something that will happen in the future it is now here he does an excellent job
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:20.440]  in the article and fours calm of laying it out this was done by design Trump
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:25.520]  fought to open the economy but the hijacked blue cities and states with
[3:44:25.520 --> 3:44:30.520]  the chai comms and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until
[3:44:30.520 --> 3:44:35.240]  we sucked it into our lungs and now we're lying there like a fish dying
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:39.480]  there's not much time to get the water out of our lungs so remember for decades
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:43.600]  to come when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:48.840]  medicine the globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist did
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:55.720]  this the globalist did this hiding in plain view politico the associated press
[3:44:55.720 --> 3:45:01.520]  you name it admit that a half a billion people extra 500 million are now at the
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:05.800]  subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving
[3:45:05.800 --> 3:45:10.160]  because the global lockdown that is hundreds of times worse than all the
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:14.340]  deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up and
[3:45:14.340 --> 3:45:17.920]  gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:22.400]  involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society created
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:25.960]  depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane ladies and
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:30.120]  gentlemen they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:34.680]  high-quality storeable food now back in stock at info or store.com and you need
[3:45:34.680 --> 3:45:38.920]  to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere big tech is
[3:45:38.920 --> 3:45:42.520]  trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even
[3:45:42.520 --> 3:45:47.240]  challenge verbally social distancing this is beyond 1984 the tyranny of the
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:51.040]  dual orders here get prepared now and spread the word the info war you are
[3:45:51.040 --> 3:45:56.600]  the Paul Revere's. The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:00.240]  think even if it ends up hurting me short term I believe in God and I believe in the
[3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:04.200]  long run it'll end up being better for myself everybody else in this world we
[3:46:04.200 --> 3:46:07.480]  live together in. I understand what comes around goes around you really put
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:10.400]  you so and I live that and I fundamentally just cellular level
[3:46:10.400 --> 3:46:15.000]  understand it now if I would have hyped up the virus was gonna kill three four
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:19.040]  five million people like the UN did I live as told five times more supplements
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:24.320]  but you know what I didn't do that but I said on a routine basis regardless people
[3:46:24.320 --> 3:46:28.440]  are vitamin D deficient people are deficient and iodine is so many other
[3:46:28.440 --> 3:46:32.920]  issues you need those products regardless so we started selling out of
[3:46:32.920 --> 3:46:38.960]  mineral fusion all the other products I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off
[3:46:38.960 --> 3:46:43.480]  because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:48.200]  were incentivized to up their bodies offenses but now I'm telling you with
[3:46:48.200 --> 3:46:52.520]  economic crises going on get your story food now.
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:47:16.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:28.680]  with Nick Baggage and welcome back you know thinking about what Alex was
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:32.920]  saying about my dad you know he was a US congressman in the early 70s that's
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:38.000]  when the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act passed and it was his
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:42.760]  legislation he was a freshman he got it passed it was the biggest indigenous
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:48.880]  settlement in the history of the United States 44 million acres and just a
[3:47:48.880 --> 3:47:55.680]  little under a billion dollars divided among 13 regional corporations and then
[3:47:55.680 --> 3:48:02.160]  under them 226 village corporations that pretty much lined up with tribal
[3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:08.200]  boundaries and regional boundaries here in Alaska and you know that that goes
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:12.480]  back even further you know you got to go back to the Treaty of Secession which is
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:17.040]  kind of an interesting name for a land sale right well the Russians didn't
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:21.000]  really have that good of a title to begin with to Alaska but what they did
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:27.160]  have they decided to sell the United States for two cents an acre in 1867 so
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:31.800]  we bought Alaska two cents an acre and they called it Seward's Folly because
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:35.960]  the Interior Secretary was being laughed at because they thought what a wasteland
[3:48:35.960 --> 3:48:40.360]  you know you're buying this boat anchor from Russia for a little over seven
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:47.320]  million bucks you know and $20 gold so multiply 7 million by 60 or 70 to get
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:52.480]  today's price but still a heck of a bargain man because what we found here
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:56.560]  was first we had the reason they sold it is they kind of petered out on the fur
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:49:01.200]  trade because they'd enslaved the local indigenous population and wiped out most
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:05.040]  of them with diseases that they brought along with them including alcoholism and
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:09.360]  those that were left there weren't any furs left they wiped out a few species
[3:49:09.360 --> 3:49:13.120]  and so they said I'll let's sell this thing because they had a good thing going
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:18.080]  they get the furs here they take them to China they get the furs in China and
[3:49:18.080 --> 3:49:22.360]  then they trade opium and trade that and it was a big deal they were making money
[3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:28.320]  on all ends of this thing in Alaska was part of that loop going through so what
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:33.160]  happened well the indigenous in that treaty this is kind of interesting if
[3:49:33.160 --> 3:49:38.560]  you were a Russian you were given three years to return to Russia or you were
[3:49:38.560 --> 3:49:44.400]  automatically a US citizen if you stayed in the territory of Alaska if you were
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:48.880]  an indigenous person who could trace their roots back as far as I could go
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:56.120]  you weren't given citizenship in fact you're an American Indian in Alaska the
[3:49:56.120 --> 3:49:59.800]  deal was you had to read and write English which a lot of immigrants couldn't
[3:49:59.800 --> 3:50:04.200]  do but they were given citizenship here but that was the deal read and write
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:09.440]  English and you had to renounce your religion which nobody else had to do
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:14.440]  unless you were indigenous so that's that's the kind of additional screwing
[3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:21.560]  over that people got here as indigenous Americans in up until the 20s when they
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:25.800]  finally got rid of those requirements you know the late 20s and then it was a
[3:50:25.800 --> 3:50:30.160]  40s we actually had one of the very first civil rights acts on the state
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:36.480]  level for most states ever even dreamed of it and tried to clean it up and by
[3:50:36.480 --> 3:50:42.120]  the mid 50s my dad showed up here and he was dirt poor I mean he arrived with
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:48.160]  11 bucks and a job you know and came from immigrant family background he's
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:53.560]  first-generation American you know as a European American then he got it you
[3:50:53.560 --> 3:50:57.280]  know he's he understood poverty that's for darn sure and what he saw here he
[3:50:57.280 --> 3:51:01.440]  didn't like very much but he was a passionate compassionate man and in his
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:08.000]  early 20s he got engaged and by his 20s he was in the state Senate later the
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:12.840]  United States Congress and in the native land claims why it was important is it
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:17.000]  wasn't just 44 million acres but they got priority selection of all lands and
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:21.800]  at the time only 1% of the land was privately held and only a small amount
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:25.880]  was under state municipal control a little bit given to the university a
[3:51:25.880 --> 3:51:28.640]  little bit to the mental health trust prior to statehood because we have a
[3:51:28.640 --> 3:51:31.960]  mental health trust it got a million acre land grant they got whittled down
[3:51:31.960 --> 3:51:39.600]  to about 750,000 acres still big chunk of land and anybody's book and they had
[3:51:39.600 --> 3:51:44.080]  they have 500 million in the bank that throws off about 50 million a year for
[3:51:44.080 --> 3:51:47.880]  the mental health issues this pre-statehood fund we also had the
[3:51:47.880 --> 3:51:52.400]  endowment land trust for the university which doesn't throw up much money
[3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:56.960]  there because poorly managed but it's big chunk of land I think it's about 250,000
[3:51:56.960 --> 3:52:02.800]  acres as I recall and then the state here's how it got sliced up see my dad
[3:52:02.800 --> 3:52:07.440]  got the indigenous 9% of this state nine times would all the rest of private
[3:52:07.440 --> 3:52:12.240]  ownership that they only wanted to give them 4% but they fought like crazy and
[3:52:12.240 --> 3:52:17.200]  got 44 million acres and why was that important they got priority selection so
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:21.960]  they could pick oil and gas and minerals property and historic properties that
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:26.520]  were poured to them within their traditional socio-economic boundaries
[3:52:26.520 --> 3:52:31.160]  of their tribal structures so they did this as an alternative to the old
[3:52:31.160 --> 3:52:36.760]  reservation system the problem was the old reservation system what it did have
[3:52:36.760 --> 3:52:43.440]  was a tribal government route and this was important because the within
[3:52:43.440 --> 3:52:46.960]  nations a lot of people understand Indian law in the United States we have
[3:52:46.960 --> 3:52:51.360]  domestic nations within this nation and they're called Indian tribal
[3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:56.120]  governments they're sovereign states are not sovereign you know that Civil War
[3:52:56.120 --> 3:52:59.480]  ended that for states if you look at the history now I don't necessarily agree
[3:52:59.480 --> 3:53:04.160]  with that but that's the way the law is today but with tribal governments they
[3:53:04.160 --> 3:53:08.760]  are sovereign they're recognized as sovereign and so in Alaska we only had a
[3:53:08.760 --> 3:53:13.280]  couple reservation tribes and they were given the option of giving up the
[3:53:13.280 --> 3:53:19.040]  reservations or maintaining them and maintaining that structure and one gave
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:24.080]  up to kept them and then everybody else got settlements but here's the problem
[3:53:24.080 --> 3:53:30.840]  without a tribal government a recognized government who did you bargain the deal
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:35.280]  with because nobody really got to vote on this because there weren't any organized
[3:53:35.280 --> 3:53:39.440]  structures you know there were informal structures so that's important to note
[3:53:39.440 --> 3:53:44.240]  in as a historical point that that maybe I won't have time to get back to today
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:48.960]  but it's an important point the the tribes themselves weren't recognized until
[3:53:48.960 --> 3:53:56.800]  1993 and after you know Alaska so this is many years 20 years past the so-called
[3:53:56.800 --> 3:54:01.320]  native land claim settlement act that my dad was involved in and it was
[3:54:01.320 --> 3:54:05.160]  important at the time because without that act you could not clear the titles
[3:54:05.160 --> 3:54:14.040]  because within the statehood act later in 1959 when that was enacted was a
[3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:18.760]  provision that we had to figure out the indigenous settlement of land because I
[3:54:18.760 --> 3:54:23.400]  mean we didn't fight a war here we can't ignore the fact that these people were
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:28.400]  here before we were they have a right to settlement and so that was a big fight
[3:54:28.400 --> 3:54:33.200]  from pre-statehood after statehood but it had to be resolved because nobody
[3:54:33.200 --> 3:54:37.240]  would invest in Alaska trans Alaska pipeline unless they knew the land that
[3:54:37.240 --> 3:54:41.840]  it was going on was you know deeded properly so they needed a settlement and
[3:54:41.840 --> 3:54:46.280]  so at that time my dad was just elected the Congress he was able to
[3:54:46.280 --> 3:54:52.040]  negotiate that settlement and get Native Americans a priority selection so
[3:54:52.040 --> 3:54:57.160]  here's how it broke down Alaska under the state Constitution we were given
[3:54:57.160 --> 3:55:03.520]  title to 105 million acres in fee which is 30% little less actually works out
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:09.520]  now to 20% of land mass in Alaska and here's the deal there in exchange for
[3:55:09.520 --> 3:55:15.280]  giving up so much of our surface estate federal government we were given 90% of
[3:55:15.280 --> 3:55:20.800]  all underlying mineral wealth rents and royalties derived from that federal land
[3:55:20.800 --> 3:55:25.000]  so it was a pretty good deal you know most states got to keep their land and
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:29.880]  the federal government got post offices and military installations you know but
[3:55:29.880 --> 3:55:35.440]  Alaska you know we're last up you know we're with Hawaii 49 and 50 so they
[3:55:35.440 --> 3:55:40.000]  screwed us out of our land Hawaii didn't have much to get screwed out of but
[3:55:40.000 --> 3:55:44.440]  at least the indigenous got theirs back in a traditional way a big chunk of it
[3:55:44.440 --> 3:55:49.480]  anyway ahead of Alaska but we didn't get that situation we had a different kind
[3:55:49.480 --> 3:55:54.200]  of settlement was an important one it was a big one it's given huge economic
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:55:58.520]  power to native organizations I mean many of them generate more than a billion
[3:55:58.520 --> 3:56:03.640]  dollars a year in revenues so it's pretty powerful what's happened here but
[3:56:03.640 --> 3:56:12.160]  again when you think about it so 20% for the state 70% for the feds 9% native
[3:56:12.160 --> 3:56:17.960]  Americans and 1% for other private landowners when you think about the
[3:56:17.960 --> 3:56:22.240]  federal side now what happened after statehood well it turns out that the
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:26.160]  agreement we made before statehood that we would get 90% of the rents and
[3:56:26.160 --> 3:56:31.400]  royalties can be changed by any successor Congress and it was when the
[3:56:31.400 --> 3:56:37.800]  ANWR was opened up in part we were reduced to a 50% royalty take on the
[3:56:37.800 --> 3:56:43.600]  basis that they said the law wasn't binding in other words statehood for
[3:56:43.600 --> 3:56:48.760]  Alaska was the same as an indigenous treaty it wasn't worth the paper it was
[3:56:48.760 --> 3:56:54.040]  printed on unfortunately the native land claim settlement so far has been
[3:56:54.040 --> 3:57:00.760]  honored the statehood act wasn't but as I said states aren't sovereign there's
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:05.480]  not much we can do I want to get back into this subject next week we'll pick
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:10.000]  it up from here because I think it's important the history of Alaska is part
[3:57:10.000 --> 3:57:15.680]  of our heritage it's a fifth of the America landmass I would say it's a big
[3:57:15.680 --> 3:57:19.840]  part of our story it's a fifth of our story but that story is our future
[3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:25.400]  America's future is Alaska's future this is Dr. Nick Beggarts coming to you
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:29.840]  from Anchorage and we'll be back next week next Friday in the meantime support
[3:57:29.840 --> 3:57:35.320]  the info wars go to the info wars store so this operation can stay in operation
[3:57:35.320 --> 3:58:00.720]  we can keep you the tip of the spear informed thanks for being here
