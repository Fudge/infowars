[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Leading of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, things really came into view for me this morning here at Reading the News.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  And I'm not even going to get started right now.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm just going to go to this important report and come back and get into it.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  But really connected some dots here that are quite frankly horrifying.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  There's a lot of good things happening too, but by admitting how much trouble we're in
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  and admitting the bad, we have a chance to avert some really serious situations.
[00:51.000 --> 00:52.000]  But look at Europe.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are a few years down the road from where we're going to be.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  Here's John Bowne's report on what's happening right now.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  The Argentine news outlet The Bubble saying,
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  if you've ever felt forgotten or unloved,
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  remember that there weren't any government officials on hand to welcome Macron to Argentina.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  Meanwhile, over another Saturday of protests, upwards of 100 people were injured.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  After the first round of yellow vest protests that left two dead 750 injured
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  and an estimated one and a half million euro in damages,
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  Macron told the French thugs, as he called them, to essentially eat cake.
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  This movement has given rise to major demonstrations and also unacceptable violence.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  I have understanding for these fellow citizens,
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  but I will not give anything to those who want destruction and disorder
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  because the Republic is both public order and the free expression of opinions.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  Since the 1950s, the French government has subsidized the production of diesel engines
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  and France leads Europe in car sales of diesel powered vehicles.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  According to the French Union of Petroleum Industries,
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  the price of diesel fuel per liter increased by 22% between October 2017 and October 2018.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  Yet, regardless of the massive response by average citizens to an impossible cost of living hike,
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  Macron is staying the course on the tax increase of 7.6 cents per liter on diesel
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  and a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel planned for the 1st of January 2019.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  Aggressive measures intended on ending diesel and petrol cars by 2040.
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  I can assure you, France will not give up the fight.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  I reaffirm clearly that the Paris Agreement remains irreversible and will be implemented,
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  not just by France, but by all the other nations.
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  With that insult to injury, literally, in a recent speech, Macron reminded the French
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  that the wording of the Paris Agreement would shut down 14 of the country's 58 nuclear reactors
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  currently in operation by the target date of 2035.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  Three-quarters of France's electricity comes from its nuclear plants.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  But these protests are nothing new.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  Protests against the taxation of petrol in France go back to the 1930s.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  The Yellow Vest protests are simply a concentrated version of earlier protests
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  in the face of the elite's rampaging madness to ram carbon taxation down the throats of a republic.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  In case you forgot Globalist, a republic is a state in which supreme power is held by the people
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  and their elected representatives, which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  The Globalist model is essentially inoperable within a true republic,
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  which is why the Globalists have sought to bastardize the oversight and culture within these republics.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  The mainstream media would have us look the other way and believe that the 245 French people killed
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  since the Charlie Hebdo attack, the unyielding sexual assaults by refugees,
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  and the Islamification of France aren't part and parcel to the Yellow Vest outrage.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  But we all know this isn't just about taxes.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  The people have had enough, and the protests are spreading.
[04:37.000 --> 04:44.000]  The Yellow Vest protests have spread to Italy, where the EU's dominance is unwanted by a populist that supports its own government.
[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  And in Brussels, on November 30th, demonstrations led to 60 arrests for disturbing the public order.
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  Populism, a tsunami of natural proportions, is something the Globalists are unequipped to deal with.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide,
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, 4 to 5 super blue,
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  So this is a loss-leader. We are losing money on this.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  And don't fight the crowds.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  We are drugged out.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  We are following other people's opinions.
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  We are controlled by the media.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  Today, it all changes.
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.000]  It is a choice, just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  They say drugs crazy. They say I'm crazy.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  But I'm here to show love.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[07:30.000 --> 07:37.000]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  Steve, I'm coming to my house. You, come to my house.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  Donald Trump is now president of the United States.
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  From the front lines of the Info World, it's Alex Jones.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info World.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  A lot of really good things are happening.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  Christians worldwide now realize that they're under attack
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  by the corporate power structure, by radical Islam,
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  by the whole Hollywood cartel.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Nation states are being reborn. Capitalism and free market is being rediscovered.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  Crowning capitalism has never been in bigger trouble.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  Mainstream media, corporate media is being propped up with hundreds of billions of dollars a year across the world.
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  And still they can't get viewers, still they can't get listeners.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  And I've got a big stack of news on that front.
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  But the bad news is incredible wealth and incredible success
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  always breeds entropy.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  It breeds decadence, it breeds spoiled, rotten gangs and cartels
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  of individuals that will ally themselves with the worst sorts in the power structure
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  and then who will systematically go out and hunt down every time in history,
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  they're better because they don't like the fact that we exist.
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.000]  The fact that we're moral and strong always is a reminder of what horrible little globalists they are.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  Now there's different types of people that join evil, obviously,
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  but I've had some conversations with globalists on record that I've been able to tell you about.
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  Others have been off record and I haven't violated those confidences.
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.000]  And I've made the point thousands of times that they collect individuals that promote liberty like they collect baseball cards.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  Probably the greatest, and put that in quotes, head of the private Federal Reserve ever was Alan Greenspan.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  Alan Greenspan was friends with Ron Paul.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  Alan Greenspan admired Barry Goldwater and Larry McDonald.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  Alan Greenspan in the 60s and 70s was a Von Mies Institute type economist.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  If you heard him in the 70s on a radio show and we've played clips before,
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  it sounded like Ron Paul or Rand Paul, but he got bought off.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  He sold out to the system.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  He was a very eloquent challenger of it.
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  And so the only reason I tell you the story here of why I haven't sold out is so you can understand their mindset.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  Almost everyone else sells out.
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  And there's a lot of reasons people do that.
[11:04.000 --> 11:16.000]  But the biggest one is they learn that the general public is dumbed down and decadent and stupid and doesn't want to be told the truth.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  And so many of the best and brightest minds who are not consciously evil, they're not out trying to hurt people,
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.000]  they join the corrupt system because they basically give up.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  Now, I am never going to give up and I see incredibly positive things happening.
[11:36.000 --> 11:45.000]  But the toll they will take on you personally to try to distract you, divert you or stop you is massive.
[11:45.000 --> 11:52.000]  And that's why I know so many other talk show hosts and so many other prominent people who openly sell out to the system
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  and who start towing the line and saying we need open borders and we need world government and hey,
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  let them teach two year olds that they're really boys or really girls and ruin their lives.
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  And they run up the white flag and they hide from the system and hope it doesn't get their kids.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  And if they had any understanding of history, that might have worked the last 50 years or so while the evil was building.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  You may have been able to hide out and stay away from it with your money.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  You're not going to be able to hide from this, ladies and gentlemen, because if you look at the constellation of information
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  and what's being taught in public schools nationwide that we detail here every day,
[12:34.000 --> 12:44.000]  it is so unbelievably evil, abusive, criminal over the top that words cannot describe it.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  And that's why they don't want the opposition to their system on air,
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  is because what they're doing is so horrible that it has to have no opposition to have any hope of succeeding.
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  I have mainstream news articles here with a straight face saying now they're teaching two year olds that they're another gender
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  without telling the parents at daycares and when the parents complain, the ADL comes out and attacks them in the nose.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  These are adults coming and talking about sex with your two year old.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  This is hardcore abuse in my view.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  And again, if you can be trained to let your small children be with people you don't even know
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  dressed up in weird outfits saying that your children belong to them basically, you'll put up with anything.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  So our instincts are coming back, our common sense, our spirits coming back,
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  but I looked at a group of articles today of a lot of which you would think would be positive from our side.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  But when you really pull back, it lets you know how serious this is.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  I'm going to cover all those when we come back.
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.000]  But make no mistake, our children are being targeted and not just by the sexualization nambler lobby.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  No, they're being targeted by a lot of other groups and individuals and the children are the future.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  So this is a war for the future.
[14:07.000 --> 14:16.000]  And I'm going to break it all down when we come back and tie it together because it is the key to everything.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  And it is the fight we face.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  We're going to go to break. We're going to come back. Two things as we go to break.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  Please remember that the enemy is test marketing shutting us down for everybody else.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  And that's in the news today. They're actually admitting that.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  They say now that we've test marketed shutting down Alex Jones, we'll take everybody down.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  Of course, they didn't really do that, but they need to create that illusion so other people get scared and won't speak out.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  There's a lot of facets to this, but that's one of them.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  But remember when you tell your friends, your family, your neighbors, people at the grocery store, people at a four-way stop about newswars.com and infowars.com.
[14:51.000 --> 15:03.000]  And about that local TV or radio station that you're listening to or watching or you spread the word or you print out an article and leave it at the barber shop or at the dentist's office.
[15:03.000 --> 15:12.000]  It changes the world when you buy a book at infowarsstore.com like the killing of Uncle Sam, the history of this thing and donate it to the library.
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  That's how we win the war one mind at a time.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  As the globalist, they can reapply their lies over and over again because they have to because it's upside down world.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  People read or see the truth. They know it at a gut level. They understand it.
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  And I would also just ask all of you to remember we have the biggest sales in our history, a clearance sale for the new year, getting rid of everything ahead of the taxes,
[15:34.000 --> 15:41.000]  where you can get a free t-shirt with every order, at least a $5 value, store-wide free shipping, 50 to 75% off.
[15:41.000 --> 15:49.000]  Many of these deals we lose money on, but we want to get all of this material out to everybody in the belief you'll love the products so much,
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  like X3 or like ultimate bone broth that you'll become a regular customer.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  Take advantage of our biggest sales ever and beat the traffic and crowds with your Christmas shopping at infowarsstore.com.
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[16:53.000 --> 17:04.000]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  The Miniman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[17:16.000 --> 17:25.000]  The Miniman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  go to MinimanStove.com. That's MinimanStove.com.
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[17:42.000 --> 17:50.000]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[17:57.000 --> 18:18.000]  FakeTV.com
[18:27.000 --> 18:38.000]  We began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.000 --> 18:52.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[20:26.000 --> 20:42.000]  We have George Robert Walker Bush lying in state.
[20:42.000 --> 20:52.000]  We have the Clintons running up to Trump and turning away in fear, like a scared dog.
[20:52.000 --> 21:02.000]  We have it all, and it's coming up, we have what's happening in the global markets as the IMF and World Bank and Goldman Sachs openly threaten nation states with collapse.
[21:02.000 --> 21:12.000]  Italy, the U.K., the United States, if we don't acquiesce to their financial terrorism, that's all coming up next segment.
[21:12.000 --> 21:19.000]  But we could defeat all of that bullying, all of that corruption if we have morals.
[21:19.000 --> 21:28.000]  It's morals that build civilization, it's morals that build families, it's morals that build security.
[21:28.000 --> 21:36.000]  But then it builds wealth, and then the children become spoiled, and their children become corrupt, and their children become devils.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  It's historic fact, it's incontrovertible.
[21:39.000 --> 21:49.000]  So I saw what I call a constellation. People never use that term, that's the old term of connecting the dots.
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  I saw Rand Paul talking about the deep state, the definition of it, being these agencies not giving Congress what they're doing.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  That's them making their own branch of government.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  He's the term of constellation of facts.
[22:00.000 --> 22:12.000]  That's a term I use that you don't hear in modern nomenclature or parlance, but we're going to use it today because here's a constellation of articles that all tie together.
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.000]  It's a theme. You won't see this theme in the news. It's not a theme the corporate news is pushing, but it's hidden in the news.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  And it's hidden in plain view. So here's a few examples of it.
[22:23.000 --> 22:31.000]  Remember this from last year and this year they had big national studies and polls done by universities.
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  The annual report on U.S. attitudes.
[22:33.000 --> 22:43.000]  Majority of millennials want to live in a socialist, fascist, or communist nation because they're being told at the university they're going to be in charge of it.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  Imagine how sick that is. And there's a bunch of studies show the same thing.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  I can talk for an hour on this, but I'm not going to. You know about that.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  44% of millennials prefer socialism. Do they know what it means? No.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  Millennials. Communism sounds pretty chill.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  Well, if you mean being room temperature, it is pretty chill.
[23:08.000 --> 23:16.000]  Millennials think socialism would create a great safe space study finds because they create these false realities on the universities.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  Now, here's the new article out today out of CNBC.
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.000]  Millennials spend less than previous generations because they literally have less money.
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  And studies show, this just came out, they have lower IQs.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  They could be black. They could be white. They could be Hispanic. They have physically lower IQs.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  They're in worse physical shape. Only what?
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  11% of Americans now are in an even passable shape. They're metabolic system.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  But it's even worse for millennials.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  I'm not saying all millennials are bad. This is an average.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  You know, it's like saying this group of people live the longest. It doesn't mean that coastal Japanese all live the longest.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  It means that it's a curve.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  So I'm just getting to one stack here. It's probably taking an hour. This is so critical, folks.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  Millennials spend less than previous generations because they literally have less money.
[24:09.000 --> 24:18.000]  And it goes on to report these big studies. They don't want money and they don't care except they don't like you if you've got it, but they want your money.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  You're like, well, that doesn't make sense.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  Oh, there what? Depending on the study, nine times more likely to say they're giving the charity, but don't.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  Six times more likely to steal.
[24:29.000 --> 24:36.000]  Bernie Sanders spent $300,000 a month on average this year. His numbers are public.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  On private jets.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  But he says when he carbon taxes on the average worker.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  But you see, he is an elite. It is different.
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  So millennials spend less than previous generations because they literally have less money.
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  And then it goes into this whole article detailing the Federal Reserve's own study.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  The private bankers. Remember, Hillary is in the WikiLeaks bemoaning horrible supporters.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  He says there's just a bunch of baristas that don't want to work and they want everything free.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  I'm so sick of these people and Trump's promising them all these jobs and he could probably deliver it.
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  And if he does that, that's it for us. I mean, you're reading this stuff and it's like the end of their system.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  But see, they just change the subject to Russia, Russia, Russia.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  And the millennials don't want to go read how the state's laughing at them and how the Democrats hate them
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  and how Trump wants to save them and wake them up and make them men.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  No, they want to join mainstream TV and feel like they're part of the winning crew and hate Trump.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  Because he trumps the guy who believes in them because he believes in himself
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  and doesn't want to sign off on humanity's destruction.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  But Trump, just like I've been in these meetings, he's been in many more, you better believe it.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  A hundred times more, the globalists go, you're never going to save these people. They'll tear you apart.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  And you go ahead and you try to fix things and make it better. They'll hate you more.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  And Trump's seeing that right now, isn't he?
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  But see, you can't lose your soul is the key. You still just can't join the globalist
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  and feed on the public because the public's asking for it because God's watching.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  And then it gets back to, oh, God doesn't exist on and on and on. No, God doesn't exist.
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  Plus, you look at these globalists. I mean, almost every one of the robber baron families has no viable sons,
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  no viable daughters. They almost all commit suicide or any of the mental institutions.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  Anderson Cooper sits on top of reportedly more than $500 billion.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  And that's why you hear all day that he didn't take the robber baron money from the five families
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  he's the only heir of and his brother committed suicide and all the other heirs and the rest of the family,
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  just they all committed suicide or they're in lunatic asylum. You could go rate this.
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  Boy, it's not like that in my family because we, we follow Jesus Christ. See,
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  we may lay our lives down for somebody, but we're certainly not killing ourselves.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  And see, now you're getting the secret. I'm going to come back from breaking it into this because
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  this is going to take a couple of seconds, but I've only hit one part of the stack.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  I haven't even gotten into the rest of it. Want to know what's coming? Want to know what's happening?
[27:22.000 --> 27:30.000]  This is critical. This is why they don't want us on air because the enemy doesn't like hearing their whole plan is going to fail.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  Because they've bet against you. They've bet against themselves.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  So imagine this. You've got a bunch of communists and socialists and fascists.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  The millennials are asking, they just said, we want authoritarianism because we heard we get some free stuff.
[27:45.000 --> 27:53.000]  Yeah. For a couple of years, then you're Venezuela because they're good at bullying their parents or bullying somebody in class
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  in front of the professor that's conservative and they get, you know, A pluses.
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  I went to college for two years and I noticed when I wrote pro America stuff,
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  I would get a C minus. When I wrote horrible, globalist garbage, I would get a pluses.
[28:09.000 --> 28:20.000]  So I did it as a joke to see that they were discredited. Then I just left and then I was immediately successful in everything I touched.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  And I'm not saying college is bad for everybody, but it's been designed to be an indoctrination scam.
[28:24.000 --> 28:35.000]  But I'm digressing. We come back. Millennials on average say 44%. I want to be a socialist.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  10% want to be a communist. 9% want to be a fascist.
[28:38.000 --> 28:50.000]  So we're up above right at 70% lust after black uniforms and checkpoints and starvation and food lines as long as they're running it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Why did this happen? And how do we stop it? And what's the rest of the story?
[28:54.000 --> 29:20.000]  Because I haven't even gone there yet. I haven't even gotten to the really big issue.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  You can get the cash loan you need now.
[29:27.000 --> 29:42.000]  If you need cash fast this holiday season to buy gifts or pay all those extra bills, go to 79cash.com and get the cash you need.

[30:24.000 --> 30:29.000]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.

[33:03.000 --> 33:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:18.000 --> 33:40.000]  For more, it's Alex Jones.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:54.000 --> 34:12.000]  Don't worry, we're going to show some of the incredible spectacle that's been ongoing with the entire blue blood, neocon, leftist, globalist, anti-American establishment, encamped in Washington D.C. in a cathedral around the dead body of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[34:12.000 --> 34:26.000]  And the laurels, the lies, the disinfo, the beautiful choral orchestra singing angelic hymns to Christ around a member of an admitted satanic death cult.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  It is in classical blaspheming style.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  So we're going to be looking at all of that coming up.
[34:36.000 --> 34:51.000]  Now, let me get back here to what's really important, and that's that I'm telling everyone something you already know.
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  Prosperity creates a bunch of decadent slobs.
[34:57.000 --> 35:13.000]  Then those of us that are still producers are attacked and intimidated and bullied so that the pigs on the animal farm, if you go with George Arwell's allegory, can stay in charge.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  And that's all that's happening here, period.
[35:16.000 --> 35:34.000]  This entire system is about intimidating us and making us submit, and so everything this system engaged in is a test of breaking our will and ensuring that we will never revolt against what they're doing.
[35:34.000 --> 35:45.000]  So they take our children, they manipulate them, they give them a globalist ideology, they give them an ideology that they are the proper ruling elite.
[35:45.000 --> 36:09.000]  And once they've then done that, they move the revolutionary phase, which is overturning any rights, any freedom, any hard fought compacts of private property, of the right to defense, of the right to religion or not to be religious.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  All of that is being erased by the new corporate leftist priesthood.
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  That's what the correctness is, is a new religion.
[36:20.000 --> 36:35.000]  And then you think about what they've been able to do with just the current college generation, the millennials, the people under, what is it, 30 years old or so?
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  25?
[36:37.000 --> 36:56.000]  These individuals in every study love to rob people, love to steal, love to lie, love to tell you how virtuous they are all day, love to not work, love to not save, and love to try to get in games and control other people's lives.
[36:56.000 --> 37:12.000]  And in national studies, they want communism, they want socialism, they want fascism. All they know is, they don't like this current system because they don't want to work, they don't want to do anything, they just want to control.
[37:12.000 --> 37:30.000]  And it's perfect that Bernie Sanders globally is the biggest socialist or communist leader today, worldwide, because he never had a paying job until he was 44 years old.
[37:30.000 --> 37:43.000]  But he's going to tell you how to live your life. And he's going to racially divide people by saying white people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[37:43.000 --> 38:01.000]  And then he has a $300,000 a month private jet bill, three $1 million houses and the multiple $100,000 vehicles and slice helicopters around in Connecticut. But I am a commissar. I am a leader.
[38:01.000 --> 38:16.000]  I honeymooned in the Soviet Union in the 70s. We're going to do that to you here, Americans. Period. You see, I don't work, I rule you.
[38:16.000 --> 38:30.000]  And so he's the patron saint of the millennials. The majority of millennials would prefer to live in a socialist, communist, or fascist nation rather than capitalist one according to New National Poll.
[38:30.000 --> 38:38.000]  And then here's another one. Millennials spend less than previous generations because they literally have less money.
[38:38.000 --> 38:54.000]  In recent years, slow home construction, oh yeah, right, declining new car sales and the poor performance of brick and mortar retailers have all been blamed on the unique taste and preferences of those born between 81 and 97.
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.000]  That means millennials have been accused of killing everything from canned tuna to the suburbs.
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  And then it just goes on to say the Federal Reserve study just shows they're poor, they got low IQs, and they're basically idiots.
[39:09.000 --> 39:19.000]  Well, yeah, you think they grow up in this country of incredible opportunity and they hate it and they think Venezuela or North Korea would be better?
[39:19.000 --> 39:28.000]  And they want to bring in radical Islamists that are opposed to their leftist ideology all because they hate America even more than they do?
[39:28.000 --> 39:38.000]  And that leads us in summation to the other news, because you already know about the millennials and that this is the one group the globalists were really able to hypnotize and get control of.
[39:38.000 --> 39:52.000]  Generation Z is the opposite because they're under such millennial henpecking and the rest of it that they actually have that instinct to rebel, which God put in us for just such times as that.
[39:52.000 --> 40:07.000]  But now there's this. All the big corporate media flooded with massive money, all the fake digital sites, all the corporate news to try to rest control the nation back from nationalists back in the globalist hands.
[40:07.000 --> 40:18.000]  Didn't completely happen. And all the world the globalists are losing, so they're stopping to spend their money at the New York Times, the Washington Post, Vanny Fair, all of it.
[40:18.000 --> 40:27.000]  And so here's the headline. Everyone's for sale. Generation of digital media darlings prepares for a frigid winner.
[40:27.000 --> 40:42.000]  Vice, Vox, Buzzfeed among other companies that once heralded the dawn of the new media age censoring all their competition, which supposedly get them out, are now grappling with decidedly old media platforms.
[40:42.000 --> 40:48.000]  And all this is, is the globalist pulling their money back. No one was already reading this to begin with.
[40:48.000 --> 40:55.000]  And they all get the order to demonize something and they all lockstep, you know, get in gear to do it.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  And then you read the articles in Vanny Fair and Salon and Huffington Post and just everywhere.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  Wired Magazine, oh, the successful de-platforming of Alex Jones means we can do it to everybody.
[41:06.000 --> 41:12.000]  The successful de-platforming of Milo Yiannopoulos means we can get everybody, let's go, then we'll be somebody.
[41:12.000 --> 41:21.000]  Once we censor everyone else, once there's no competition, no, then everything just collapses and people hate your guts even more.
[41:21.000 --> 41:28.000]  Let's see, the globalists didn't care about a vibrant, free press. They cared about power. So you were used yet again, as I told you would be.
[41:28.000 --> 41:35.000]  Here's Vox. Milo Yiannopoulos collapsed shows that no platforming can work.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  That's because Milo was funded by the Mercers and didn't have his own infrastructure.
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  Not M4s, but they don't care. They just announced we're gone even though we're not and some ways we're stronger.
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  He who must not be named M4s, Alex Jones, this is Wired, he goes on to say now that he's been successfully de-platformed,
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  we can say his name as if you shang my name ever did anything.
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  We always had our great audience of red-blooded humans that love freedom. You've never been part of it.
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.000]  It's like you're another universe or how cold it is on Mars at night. Does that affect me?
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  But it's interesting into your sick little brains.
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  There's big, breathless New York Times articles and CNN ones. The neocon, war-mongering, war-criminal, weekly standard.
[42:17.000 --> 42:26.000]  No one reads it and the people that own it aren't funding it. It may be illegal that there are other conservative websites and groups,
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  but weekly standard may be shut down. They hate Trump. They're good. Help them! Help the weekly standard! Help!
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  Help the anointed ones, the Trotsky eyes. That's who set it up. Help them! Help them!
[42:37.000 --> 42:43.000]  You see this burial of George Herbert Walker Bush. It is symbolic. It is emblematic. It is archetypal.
[42:43.000 --> 42:49.000]  It is a ritual of the burying of the Clintons, the burying of the globalists. This year has been amazing.
[42:49.000 --> 42:59.000]  David Rockefeller, dead. Zbikar Brzezinski, dead. Herbert Walker Bush, dead. And a bunch of others, dead, dead, dead, dead.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  In the last few months, M.F.O. Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week. Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide.
[43:09.000 --> 43:18.000]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off double-patriot points. Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[43:18.000 --> 43:27.000]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  So this is a loss-leader. We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything. And don't fight the crowds.
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.000]  M.F.O. Wars Store dot com, M.F.O. Wars Life dot com, or triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.000]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire Infowar possible.
[46:56.000 --> 47:22.000]  Again, you are the Resistance.
[47:26.000 --> 47:48.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:48.000 --> 48:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to play for you some of what's ongoing with the beautiful Choral Choir Orchestra playing at George Robert Walker Bush's third day of worship.
[48:05.000 --> 48:18.000]  But know this, at the start of the next hour, I'm going to cover something that you're not going to hear anywhere else that is the heart of where the globalist attack on humanity is going.
[48:18.000 --> 48:35.000]  Remember the Proud Boys? They're the folks who are inclusive of race, religion, sexuality, classical liberal, and they believe in pre-speech at these universities.
[48:35.000 --> 49:04.000]  And so you heard about a month ago that they got listed as a domestic extremist group by the FBI, and then they got removed off of Twitter and all these other places.
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  And the FBI came out today and said we never did that.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  And that's the big story I haven't gotten to yet, because we're going to have to follow lawsuits over it.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  The FBI, Trump didn't do this.
[49:18.000 --> 49:30.000]  Reality winner type folks inside the government, remember she was the anti-fub, al-Qaeda, white-hating blonde girl who had a high-level security clearance, was giving the information to ISIS.
[49:30.000 --> 49:38.000]  Show your name to reality winner.
[49:38.000 --> 49:51.000]  Somebody at infregard infrastructure level, at CEO level, and these companies put in my banking record for info wars that we are a certified terror group like Hezbollah.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  Now this is going to be a huge deal when it all comes out.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.000]  We have the documents, but we're, this stuff's classified.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  But you wonder why we had our banking taken away.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  The plan is to do it to all of you.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  They just gave Tim Cook an award two days ago for banning me off the internet, and the ADL said this is the model.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  So Hitler took Jews right to commerce away.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  First put them in ghettos.
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  Now the ADL is literally trying to put me in a digital ghetto like Hitler did the Jews.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  But of course the ADL supports Soros, the ones that overthrow Israel now.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  The ADL is now an anti-Jew, anti-Israeli, anti-Israeli state group.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  And I'm not just saying that, they are.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  Of course we're going to take down Israel, you act like you're for it.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  Oh man, the Hutzpah.
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  Whoa, that's next level man, that is next level.
[50:42.000 --> 50:51.000]  Let me tell you, to say that Trump's in anti-Semite, as the left does, and many members of the ADL do, that's pure crap and everyone knows.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  I'm pro-nation state.
[50:55.000 --> 51:00.000]  And I'm pro-nation states that are successful and that have vibrant societies.
[51:00.000 --> 51:06.000]  I support nation states, whether it be Nigeria or South Africa or Russia or Israel U.S.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  I support people.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  But you think about Proud Boys was banned on thousands of platforms.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  They had bank accounts taken away everything because they were good men.
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.000]  Black, white, old, young, straight, gay, who would go out to events and not attack anybody.
[51:21.000 --> 51:28.000]  But when methad professors in black outfits would come over to hit women in the head with metal batons, they'd knock their clock off.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  They'd knock their block off.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  So to clock them, I just said knock their clock off, it's double.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  They'd knock their block off.
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  They'd clock them over and over again.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  And they just can't handle that, methad professors can't handle that.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  So what's been done to them has been done to me.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  And it's going to be coming out soon.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  We're just figuring out which groups the right one to sue.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  But we even know the groups that are putting out the filings, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  You say, oh, just sue them.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  They got a half billion dollars offshore.
[52:03.000 --> 52:07.000]  They're a mafia organization hooked into German intelligence, the EU.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Basically financed by Juncker.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  We got documents on that.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  Oh, Southern Poverty Law Center is crap in their pants right now.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  Yeah, we got the docs.
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  Just like I had all the Soros docs earlier this year.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  How you guys are staging the riots.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  That'll be very useful in court, won't it?
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  Especially when you're bringing cases against me saying I'm making it up.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  Oh, you got a tiger by the tail.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  It's plain to see.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  And you know what happens when you get a tiger by the tail.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  So to put bookends on what I just covered.
[52:40.000 --> 53:00.000]  You have the successful conversion of a large portion of people say 35 to about 15.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  That doesn't mean everybody in that group.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  We're not group thinkers.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  This is the average.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  This is how the establishment sees you.
[53:06.000 --> 53:13.000]  They literally believe in authoritarianism because they think they get something free.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  You know, real authoritarianism comes in.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  They'll be begging people like me to work for them.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  They'll be shooting you in the back of the head or putting you in a work camp.
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  You're so stupid.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  People that think that the type of morons that lay around and help bring down a system.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  You think you get hired?
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  You think you get put in positions of power?
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  You don't get anything.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  They don't leave you above ground.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  You're just like the Palestinians.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  They won't take one Palestinian and Saudi Arabia or Jordan or Egypt because they know
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  Palestinian just means an Arab that wants to take over some free land.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  It's a constant political group that wants to overthrow everybody.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  And that's what millennials are.
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.000]  They're just a bunch of angry, pissed off, stupid people that want to take everything over.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  Probably routinely, out in public, and it's usually some white liberal, saddles up to
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.000]  me, sidles up to me, and says, how dare you not support the Palestinian state and all
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  the horrible things Israel does?
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  Blah, blah, blah.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  And I say, okay.
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  The Palestinians have said they want to drive Israel out of the sea and kill all the Jews,
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  right?
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  Hamas and Hezbollah.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  Oh, shut up, you racist.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  I mean, they said that, right?
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  So when somebody says that to you, I'm going to kill you.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  You're supposed to go, oh, here's a white flag.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Let me expand on that.
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  Do any of the other Arab states take in Palestinians?
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  You don't have any history.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  You don't have any facts.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  You didn't do any research.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  And I'm sick of stupid leftists that go sit in universities and hear how elite and how
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.360]  smart they are all day coming and getting in my face telling me about political stuff
[54:54.360 --> 54:56.360]  I should support.
[54:56.360 --> 54:57.360]  Here's the deal.
[54:57.360 --> 55:00.840]  If I have no chance of doing something political because of all the people involved and Israel
[55:00.840 --> 55:06.040]  has hundreds of nuclear weapons, Israel's going nowhere.
[55:06.040 --> 55:07.040]  It's going nowhere.
[55:07.040 --> 55:08.040]  It's going nowhere.
[55:08.040 --> 55:16.520]  And the reason I obsess on this Israel thing is it is the demarcation line or the crossroads
[55:16.520 --> 55:21.000]  with the super right wing and the crazy left wing and the establishment and Google and
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.480]  Facebook and all of them.
[55:22.480 --> 55:29.360]  Their whole operating system is this weird, crazy anti-Semitic thing while they then ban
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.960]  everyone saying they're anti-Semitic, who's not anti-Semitic on record.
[55:33.960 --> 55:36.600]  And it's just total mental illness.
[55:36.600 --> 55:40.280]  I don't hate Israel, but I'm sure it's hell sick of hearing about it.
[55:40.280 --> 55:41.880]  It's a diversion.
[55:41.880 --> 55:48.120]  The Chinese are the system, not Israel.
[55:48.120 --> 55:49.560]  Israel is just like America.
[55:49.560 --> 55:51.960]  It's a bunch of different groups fighting over power.
[55:51.960 --> 55:54.200]  They're not fighting over power in China.
[55:54.200 --> 55:56.840]  They're fighting to take over the world.
[55:56.840 --> 56:00.720]  And people need to grow up and they need to stop it.
[56:00.720 --> 56:05.200]  Israel's just like the United States, just like Germany, just like all those countries.
[56:05.200 --> 56:07.400]  Hell half of Israel's Russian.
[56:07.400 --> 56:13.400]  Talk about the Russian consp- it's all crap.
[56:13.400 --> 56:15.080]  Western countries are under attack.
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.160]  The worth ethics under attack.
[56:17.160 --> 56:18.880]  Free markets under attack.
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.600]  Things that people fought wars for, free speech, the right to commerce, the right to live,
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.600]  the right to worship, the right to not worship is all being taken away.
[56:28.600 --> 56:33.680]  Your birthright, I don't care whether you're a Jew or a Muslim or you're Mexican or you're
[56:33.680 --> 56:35.720]  English or who you are.
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.880]  If you don't take the birthright of freedom and a future and say you're willing to stand
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.840]  up for it, then you're a chump like these dumbass millennials.
[56:44.840 --> 56:50.200]  Half of them want to be communists or fascists or 70% actually, 45 want to be communists,
[56:50.200 --> 56:53.720]  10% want to be socialists, 9% want to be fascists.
[56:53.720 --> 56:55.720]  They're just idiots.
[56:55.720 --> 57:00.880]  They're morons as if you're going to have a seat at the table in a fascist government.
[57:00.880 --> 57:06.120]  You don't get a seat in a fascist government unless you're a commando in the military, idiot.
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.080]  And you don't get a seat in a communist government unless you are the most murderous piece of
[57:10.080 --> 57:16.400]  bank robbing garbage, child molesting crap you can imagine.
[57:16.400 --> 57:17.680]  You don't get free welfare.

[59:53.600 --> 01:00:00.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.920]  I've got a tiger in my tail, it's way to see.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.760]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.080]  He never gives up.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:19.080]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:27.080]  I've got a tiger in my tail, well I thought the day I met you, you were me as a lamb,
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.080]  just the kind to fit my dreams in plans.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:39.080]  Now the taste we're living takes away from the same, and it looks like I've got a tiger
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.080]  in my tail.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.080]  I got a tiger in my tail, it's way to see.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.080]  I won't be much left.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.880]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:59.080]  Well the Proud Boys, they were designated a terror group, of course none of it was true,
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:06.120]  by the anti-professors that populate the mainstream media, but it mattered.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:13.400]  The false accusation, the yellow star pinned to them, they were sent to the ghetto and hopefully
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:19.840]  to the gulag, if the leftists get their way like they did in the Soviet Union, the ADL
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.000]  is working around the clock to bring that gulag future to America.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.920]  They want people arrested for criticizing open borders and radical Islam, because after
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.560]  all, they're pro-Israel over at the ADL, that's why they support George Soros that wants
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.120]  it blown off the map.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:43.120]  Good luck jumping the shark ADL to the probably lost center.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.840]  You guys have really gone too far, haven't you?
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.120]  You really exposed who you're working for, shame on you, but I guess there were a lot
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.320]  of Jews that worked for Hitler weren't there, like George Soros.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.200]  So now it's pretty clear, and Tim Cook's got his slave factories in China and talked about
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.720]  how it's a sin to have Alex Jones on the air and taking Alex Jones off, it's a sacrament
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720]  to God.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:18.240]  What a blaspheming little turd.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.720]  But the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray, and the Proud Boys are going to
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.480]  be joining us on the other side of this break.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:35.360]  We're also going to come in with some of the choral choir music of H.W. Bush's ongoing
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.800]  Worship Fest, and just juxtaposed that, can we cue back up what Skull and Mones had meant
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.320]  it was very accurate, Robert De Niro's production of The Good Shepherd, that piece we played
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:53.400]  yesterday, bathing in feces, men having sex with each other in giant vats of feces and
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.840]  pissing on each other, and Matt Damon dressed up like a woman as they bend him over and
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.920]  have sex in the feces.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.640]  Oh yeah, so why not have, you know, the coffin there, and everybody else is getting a coffin,
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:14.000]  and you can channel the devil, or this pantheon of other gods and goddesses entering your
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.680]  body, and then people can pee pee on you.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.120]  I'll be your guide for the next few weeks.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.600]  The revealing process is our most sacred ritual.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.840]  It's been a Skull tradition since the late 1700s, and it is the foundation of your class's
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.680]  commitment to each other.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.240]  Each soulmate pair will be placed within a device, and then you may ask them any question
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.280]  you want about anything that you want.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.920]  The object is to learn all that you can about each other.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.080]  After they've revealed all to you satisfaction, release them.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.800]  Which pair wants to go first?
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.800]  Caleb and I will.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:11.600]  Now we're going to go to break, and then of course there's the having sex in the coffins.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:17.760]  I wonder if they're going to have sex in the coffins today with George Herbert Walker Bush,
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.960]  but we're going to come back and see that's a really good satanic ritual you see.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.480]  It's a really good satanic ritual when you can have it right in the middle of a church,
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.760]  and most of the people there don't even know that you've turned it into a satanic ritual.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.880]  That's called a real satanic ritual.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.160]  That's the good ones you want.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.880]  George Herbert Walker has moved on from smearing human feces all over his face, masturbating
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880]  in it.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.920]  Sorry to talk like that, that is 41 for you, and George W. He's moved on to the whole
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.920]  country watching while he does it, but this time it's not a ritual, it's not a simulation.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:29.160]  And now because of their intensifying censorship it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:34.240]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.120]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, Intel you name it.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:45.680]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.880]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:55.120]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:24.960]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:36.840]  You know George Herbert Walker Bush is laying in rest there in Washington D.C. right now
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.360]  and we've seen Trump walk by the Clintons and the Clintons jump back like he's a big
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.240]  dog and they're a black cat, we'll be talking to some of the proud boys who we all heard
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.560]  got banned off the internet because the FBI, that's the new god like Mueller, said they
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.560]  were extremists.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.880]  Well my god if you say somebody's extreme, turn out they never even said that.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.400]  It's Antifa that's been listed as a terror group.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.880]  But this is all part of the disinfo op, we'll be talking to them here in a moment, but here's
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:05.360]  some of the choral choir music being played for TV viewers, I'm going to then, well for
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.040]  radio listeners you'll hear it too in a moment, play the trailer from The Good Shepherd which
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:13.760]  they admit is an accurate depiction of just some of the rituals that George Herbert Walker
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.720]  Bush and George W went through and look, it's a free country, guys want to roll around a
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.000]  bunch of feces and devil worship, that's their deal.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.080]  It's just we should talk about that in the hindsight, so let's go ahead and play some
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.640]  of this, this is what they want us to think they are, what they think they do, but talk
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.360]  about how great they are, about all the millions of devils in the wars he started, anti-national
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:42.400]  sovereignty, anti-gun, he wanted the IRA abolished, he also lied about not raising taxes, read
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:49.040]  my lips, a new world order is coming into view, we have the very real prospect of a global
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:56.200]  government run by the UN, that all over the world they're being voted out, the globalists
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:03.600]  are being removed, and here they are coming, this is live, to get the sarcophagus, the
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:13.040]  sarcophagi, to use the Egyptian term, and to carry it to lay unrest, but they say is
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:19.040]  he going to Arlington Cemetery, is he going to Kinney-Buckport, Maine, I forgot, not that
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.880]  against folks from Kinney-Buckport, Maine, I just, I love the, the whole Texas lost
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:33.240]  a great patriot today, might as well have a platypus from Australia, the platypus is
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:40.400]  a famous Texan, again I don't want to speak ill of the dead, it's just the worshiping
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:51.720]  of this guy, like he is a god, oh they're going to bury him in Texas, oh I knew it,
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:09:03.880]  college station, named after him now, there you go, he helps set the country on a course
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:09.680]  of deindustrialization and almost destruction, but now we've got to worship him, but that's
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.960]  corporate media, you know most people watching this see absolutely through it, you've got
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:21.960]  all these people just sycophantically worshiping in DC, what a swamp, what a, what a diseased
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:31.920]  rat hole, okay let's go ahead and then show you a Hollywood depiction of just some of
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:49.280]  the lighter stuff that goes on at Scullin' Bones, superimposed with this here it is,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:10:05.320]  there's a feel being a woman, why do you want to know, gentlemen, I will remind you, you
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  have all taken an oath of secrecy, you have been chosen to become members of the American
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:24.320]  Supreme Court justices, congressmen and senators, captains of science and industry, the very
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:33.320]  best of America, we are the four, we are the five, we are the better, we are the tithes,
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:51.460]  who has been the nation for rise all over the world, the nation as a nation representing
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:55.460]  That's personal, Mr. Russell. I take it very personally.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.460]  Edward, we're all in this together.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.460]  Come back inside.
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.460]  Your brother's life.
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:09.460]  Tell us, Mr. Wilson, brother to brother, something you've never told anyone before.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:12.460]  Your most guarded secret.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.460]  There's George W. getting in the coffin, and now he's really in it.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.460]  He's not simulating now.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.460]  All right, joining us for the Balanced The Hour,
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.460]  Roger Stone's popping in for one segment with huge exclusive news.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.460]  Rufio Panman, that needs no introduction here, and Mega Titan.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:43.460]  Proud boys, and they're launching a new Facebook show at Titans of Liberty News Wars.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.460]  Titans of Liberty, at Titans of Liberty, so you find it.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.460]  And isn't it funny?
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.460]  AP Reuters are all being forced to admit it.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.460]  FBI says it did not designate Proud Boys as extremist groups.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.460]  Did not actually do that, but the mainstream corporate press,
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.460]  the same ones that told us that Paul Manafort met with Julian Assange,
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.460]  or that General Flynn said he was a Russian agent.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.460]  None of it was true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.460]  The truth is, Antifa funded by Soros on record,
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.460]  and others goes out, a bunch of meth-ed professors and attacks women and children.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.460]  Gavin McGannis, founder of Vice so much more, just said,
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.460]  hey, we ought to have a pro-Western, pro-male group.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.460]  You can be straight, gay, black, white, whatever.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.460]  That just promotes Americana.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.460]  It became very popular. He got demonized for it, and he says,
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.460]  hey, I've given Bert a lot of things.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:37.460]  He's not against it, but he's saying, I don't run it. It's out on its own.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.460]  Because they're even attacking his house, his studio.
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:42.460]  He want me to get into all of it. They're trying to take his bank accounts away.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:46.460]  They're trying to destroy him off of the extremism designation.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:51.460]  The truth is, Homeland Security has said Antifa is a true terror organization.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.460]  So another big hoax is about to bite the dust here on air.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:59.460]  But remember, I haven't followed lawsuits yet,
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.460]  but we got the documents through banking.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:05.460]  Now we got the more internal documents,
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:09.460]  and these are national security law.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:13.460]  With who is inside the big banks?
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.460]  And who is doing this? Because this isn't even government.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:19.460]  They've given governmental power to 800,000 contractors.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.460]  They have, whether you work in a big bank, or a dam, or whatever,
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:28.460]  key people have been given basically government power.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.460]  Totally rogue.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:35.460]  And they're then going into the designation and putting a designation in that,
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.460]  don't call the police on this person, but don't do business.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.460]  They're a terrorist.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.460]  It didn't matter my credit, it's perfect on both sides.
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.460]  Perfect banking record.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.460]  And of course, you can only learn this from other banks.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:50.460]  So we're having to parallel construct for our lawsuits.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.460]  But the feds will know what that means.
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.460]  But we have them. This is such a scandal, folks.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.460]  And this is what it is, where you're a group that goes out as peaceful,
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:01.460]  but defensively stands up to people being attacked.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.460]  We come back from break, we'll roll some famous Antifa footage for team of yours.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.460]  But gentlemen, good to have you with us. Thank you for joining us.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.460]  I know Antifa attacks from Proud Boys in New York a few months ago.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.460]  And even though it's on video, they're trying to indict the Proud Boys.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.460]  What an incredible time that when you fight back against methods that attack you,
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:21.460]  you're a bad person.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.460]  Yeah, definitely. That's the new norm nowadays.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:30.460]  You know, no matter how it comes across,
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.460]  whether we even had video like you saw with the New York guys,
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:40.460]  it seems like we consistently get the blame and the information that was false
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.460]  that went out to, I don't know how many articles against us.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:49.460]  We were deep platform, silent censored, refused business all the way,
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:52.460]  you know, all for defending ourselves.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.460]  Well, I'm going to give you the next few days,
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.460]  all fair, a blueprint, looking at things.
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.460]  I would imagine you've been put in the Interpol database as well.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:05.460]  No judge, no jury, it's like a Jew having a yellow star put on them under Hitler in 35.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.460]  They just did. It's going to be a huge scandal.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.460]  It's light years ahead of Facebook mining user data, which I'm not defending.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.460]  They're making that a big international deal.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:17.460]  Imagine the banks and the left, not just the IRS going after Patriot groups,
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:20.460]  as we know they did, and auditing them or arresting them.
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:27.460]  Now it's literally putting a secret designation in there in your file saying you're a terrorist.
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.460]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.460]  Yeah, well, I think that's all they can really do these days,
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.460]  is try and do the best they can to label you an extremist.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.460]  Obviously, the FBLC has played a huge part in swandering people's names.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.460]  So, you know, we see their tactics,
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.460]  and the best we can do is to suggest and keep pushing forward.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.460]  Well, you got to follow lawsuits, and we're going to come back,
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:54.460]  we're going to talk to the gentleman we haven't had on the air yet.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.460]  I know it was work. We're going to talk to Jason, AKA Mega Titan.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.460]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.460]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.460]  The Bug Assault, a miniaturized shotgun,
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.460]  which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.460]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.460]  So much fun. You'll forget you have a wife and kids.
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.460]  Makes the perfect stocking stuffer.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.460]  Get your Bug Assault today,

[01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:00.460]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.460]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.460]  you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.460]  At Heart and Body Extract,
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.460]  we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.460]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.460]  In these uncertain times,
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:31.460]  it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.460]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire,
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.460]  then there's a much better way.
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.460]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.460]  that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.460]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use,
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.460]  smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.460]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,

[01:17:54.460 --> 01:18:16.460]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018.
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:38.460]  Page 6 of 7
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:46.860]  Today's 24 hour only special at infowarstore.com is certified super silver wound gel, now 60%
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:47.860]  off.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.460]  2018 has been an incredible year and as we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.900]  all again for making the entire Info War possible.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.420]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.460]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:07.660]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.580]  literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:14.700]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.500]  gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.620]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:26.220]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.860]  nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:34.780]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:39.500]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.500]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:51.020]  and vitamin C, it super charges it and makes it even more bio available.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.140]  discovery.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:01.580]  This is Alex3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:31.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:44.700]  Well, the final joke on the country, and I don't blame Trump for being nice about it,
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:49.500]  he's got to do that to respect the office of president, but we are watching him here
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:55.140]  on TV viewer, George W. Bush waved bye to his dad as he's put in the back of the hearse
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:59.900]  to be sent away, and let's be clear, I think George W. Bush is a lot better person than
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:07.700]  his dad, not just because I know George W. Bush, not very well, but I know him, and I'll
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:13.820]  just leave it at that, because his daughter went to school with my sister, and when he
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:19.420]  was governor, and I met him a few times, sat at the same table with him and ate, and I
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.180]  know people that know him, and I know people that know his dad.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:28.260]  His dad was seriously, seriously bad news and a globalist, and not for the sovereignty
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:34.340]  of this country, and I just can't sit here and watch all this worship like with McCain
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.820]  and not say what the guy did.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:41.180]  He's the guy that gave us the new order speech and launched all these wars to take out non
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.860]  radical Muslims and put the bad ones in.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:53.100]  Now getting back to Jason, who's known as make America great again Titan, Titans of
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:22:00.940]  Liberty, at News Wars, Owen Schwartz is going to be on the show with them tonight, but the
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:07.700]  big deal, think about how big this is, that these guys go out to dozens and dozens and
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:16.780]  dozens of events, and they never get in trouble.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:21.260]  And then we hear in the news, the FBI has said they're an extremist group, no judge,
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:25.340]  no jury, and then suddenly they're kicked off Facebook, kicked off Twitter, kicked off
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.460]  all these places, hundreds of groups across the nation, a pro-western, pro-America diverse
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:33.340]  group that believes in free speech.
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:39.540]  Well, you can't have people stand up to the left bullies of Antifa who are on CNN, MSNBC
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:46.180]  saying, we're going to come out and not let conservatives or libertarians or nationalists
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.180]  have demonstrations.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:50.460]  Our own Owen Schreuer tried to go out and cover a demonstration for the young lady that got
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:54.740]  shot in the back by the illegal alien, and the San Francisco jury let him off, said,
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:59.540]  well, you're allowed to kill him, you're an illegal alien, and the ultimate versus signal.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:03.260]  We tried to go to an event at a local park, Antifa had guns and wouldn't let a reporter
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:10.780]  in, in front of police, we got armed men on the streets in Texas, bullying reporters like
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:14.300]  we're a third world country, we're in communist mass, this is how far it's gone, and then
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:23.740]  Rufio and Megatitan, they try to go out and simply be there and defend people.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.340]  This is just the one knockout we show, there's like 10 of them, and there's so many other,
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:32.580]  so much footage of them attacking people first and getting their asses knocked on the ground,
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:37.380]  and then they're the bad guys, so going back to Megatitan, we haven't talked to you yet,
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:41.380]  break down why you got into Proud Boys and how big a deal this is, that this just came
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:47.700]  out, and it's been in some of the major publications, but that the FBI says they never designated
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:52.100]  you as an extremist group, and this is just made up, but it's been used to censor you
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.300]  everywhere, this is just incredible.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:24:01.100]  Well, first of all, is an extreme honor to finally be here, be here on Info Wars with
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:08.060]  the real resistance, I've been watching you guys for years, and I'm actually not a Proud
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:16.100]  Boy officially, so I know they say this is something we can't do, but I do support the
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:22.500]  Proud Boys 100% video, and I know staying a middleman is what I need to do in order
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:27.580]  not to be censored and thrown into these categories, because they like to throw us into boxes
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:32.900]  that way they can censor us.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:37.540]  Why do you think they're so threatened by the idea of men going out to rallies, and
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.420]  they get attacked fighting back?
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:42.860]  In England and in Europe, if you fight back against people robbing your house, they'll
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:48.260]  throw you in prison for 20 years, and the armed robbers get a month.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:54.900]  Well, Alex, our lives begin to end, the day we become silent about things that matter.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:59.380]  Martin Luther King said that, it doesn't matter your color, they're afraid of people
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:05.380]  speaking the truth like you Alex, we're all Alex Jones, we're all Donald Trump, God bless
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.420]  Info Wars, God bless Donald Trump, and God bless the United States of America.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:16.180]  They don't want to hear people like me, a Hispanic Trump supporter, say, I love President
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.180]  Trump.
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.740]  They don't want to hear that.
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:25.220]  They want to push this agenda down our system that's anti-American, it's anti-male, and
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:30.500]  at the end of the day, it's anti-human, and it is satanic, and we're here to talk about
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.500]  it.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.500]  We're not going to throw it under the rug.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.500]  We know what George Bush was, and we know what the Bushes are.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.220]  We know about the Carlisle Group, we know about Al Qaeda.
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:44.500]  I thought it was un-American to fund in our radical terrorist, Mr. Obama.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:50.100]  I thought it was un-American, Operation Fast and Furious, Army of the Mexican Cartel.
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:56.260]  I thought it was un-American Operation Jade Helm, and the Patriot Act, labeling us as
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:57.260]  terrorists.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:58.420]  This is where it all began.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.940]  This is how I woke up.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:04.860]  I saw how they folded the $20 bill, if you guys have ever seen this, that's tuning in
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.860]  right now.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:06.860]  It's very interesting.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:07.860]  It shows the World Trade Center.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.860]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:13.740]  It shows the World Trade Center on one side, the Pentagon on the other side.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:18.620]  Right where it was hit, right where the smoke was coming out, 9 plus 11 is 20, United Airlines
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.180]  on one side, American Airlines on the other side.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:26.900]  I started looking into 9-11, and of course, 9-11, the road to tyranny popped up.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:33.420]  The Obama deception popped up, and I woke up, and at that moment, I knew I couldn't be silent.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.420]  It was too late.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.140]  I was already red-pilled, and there was no other way of turning back, and I decided,
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.100]  in 2016, instead of arguing with all my friends, arguing with all my family, you know what
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.100]  I'm going to do?
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.620]  I'm going to start my own page, like Alex said, and I did.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:53.380]  I actually was David Knight's very first caller, and I started a page called, it's amazing,
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:59.980]  but I started a page called, not alt-right, just right, and I didn't have any logos.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.180]  I didn't make any of that stuff up, so I just put your guys' pictures in the back.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:06.900]  You are the resistance, you know, and they took my page off.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.940]  They said I was impersonating you because I go on my New World Order rants, like I just
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:14.460]  did right now, and I called myself Chico Alex Jones.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.940]  So that's how MagiTitan was born.
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:17.540]  Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with your work.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.540]  That's awesome.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.540]  You've reached millions of people.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:20.540]  That's exciting, man.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.540]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.380]  I really appreciate it, Alex.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.940]  I mean, you're really an inspiration.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.940]  You are the truth.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.060]  You are the resistance, and that's what you do.
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.180]  Well, listen, we're all in this together.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:31.180]  We're all in this together.
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:36.700]  I'm just excited that you guys are hosting a show now, and all this is happening, and
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.140]  the good news is, you guys need to go on the offense, obviously, with the other Proud
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.140]  Boys groups.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.140]  We'll talk about this with Rufio.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:46.380]  We've got his mic fixed a little bit when we come back, because this is a big deal.
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.140]  This has been done to me.
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:49.500]  It's a huge scandal.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.460]  The press comes out and says, the FBI says, basically, you're a terror group.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.740]  You're an extremist group.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:58.380]  And then it's this nebulous thing, and then all of a sudden, your whole life gets ruined.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:03.460]  This is an expansion of the IRS persecuting Christians and conservatives in the last ten
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:09.900]  years, and it's got to stop finishing up here before we go to segment.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:15.540]  Has any of this been reversed, Rufio, now that the FBI admits it wasn't true?
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:22.300]  No, we're just in the beginning stages right now.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:27.180]  We just got our new chairman in to represent Proud Boys, his name's Enrique, and he's
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:31.100]  actually a Cuban American, and a lot of people, they try and pin us, you know, the racial
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:37.420]  card on us, and we're just taking it one step at a time, and hoping that we can, you know,
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:39.980]  start to reach out to the public in a legitimate way.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:43.900]  Well, it's going to blow up the fact that you guys, they've tried to ban you, and the
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:47.140]  fact that you're standing up against the Antifa, I mean, you guys are heroes.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:51.620]  I mean, the Antifa are literally a bunch of methad professors that want to come out and
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:59.100]  hit women that have bike locks, and nobody's putting up with it, they'll be right back.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.620]  Want revenge on the common house fly?

[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:15.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:39.300]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:43.940]  You know when you think about George Herbert Walker Bush, who was in Beb the Clintons and
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:47.860]  others, and his whole world government project for the Rockefellers, and everything we're
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:52.660]  fighting against, and you see our military order to be out there worshiping him, you
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:59.180]  witness this big state funeral, they're hijacked our country, they're working against it, and
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.180]  they get all the trappings of it.
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:03.180]  That's what makes me angry.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:09.460]  So I'm not here putting down someone that's dead, in fact I don't even like doing it.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.740]  But are we sad Hitler's dead?
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:12.900]  Are we sad Stalin's dead?
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.180]  Are we sad Mao Zedong's dead?
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:18.380]  Are we sad Jeffrey Dahmer's dead?
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:23.220]  Because George Herbert Walker Bush told, this came out in congressional hearings, Saddam
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:26.740]  Hussein through the US Ambassador, April Gillespie, to go ahead and invade.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:32.300]  He was trained by the CIA for two years in Egypt in 1957-58.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.220]  This is all congressional hearings.
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:41.500]  He was put into power in 79, in a coup the US funded, Saddam was put in there as a stabilizing
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.300]  force, he was in order to attack Iran, he did what he was told, then they said, you're
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:51.860]  going to pay us $30 billion back, and he said, I was promised.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:56.260]  That would be forgiven, we just lost hundreds of thousands of people, we just killed millions
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.740]  of Iranians, and they said, no, we're going to lower your credit rating and basically
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:06.700]  cut you off, he said, the hell you're not, I'll go and Kuwait, they've been slant drilling,
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:11.180]  and they told him, we don't get involved in inner Arab affairs, on video in a meeting
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:15.140]  Saddam videoed it, he shook her hand and said, really, she said, you do whatever you need
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.180]  to, we're not going to get involved, he was told the same thing a decade before to invade
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:26.940]  Iran, I'm not lionizing Saddam Hussein, I was there, I studied it, I've been covering
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:33.180]  this for 24 years, I had family that was over there, and then the chemical weapons dumps
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:39.420]  got blown up to cover them up, that Bush and others had sold them to him, and then the
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:44.700]  nerve gas rained down, and they told our troops, oh, the detectors are all going off, 25,000
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:51.940]  detectors went off, for Sarin and VX, and they told our troops, you weren't hit with
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:57.740]  nerve gas, and hundreds of thousands died in the next few years, and they'd have hearings
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:02.820]  in Congress, begging in wheelchairs, and they would get no funding, because they weren't
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:08.780]  hit in a war, you weren't injured in war, even though you were hit with nerve gas, because
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.780]  George Herbert Walker Bush didn't want to pay for it, and they didn't want to admit
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:19.060]  that the war he launched killed 300,000 of our troops, so I'm supposed to just forget
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:23.340]  about them, and we've got our guests on, we've got Roger Stone popping in, gentlemen, what
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:27.900]  is it like, because some of the proud boys are big guys like you guys, some are just
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.360]  regular sized guys, and I've met a lot of you guys, you're not out looking for trouble,
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:38.500]  but talking to you, when you see guys with, again, clubs and bike locks and knives, stabbing
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:44.940]  and punching and hitting mainly women, when I first ran to Antifa over a decade ago,
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.460]  I noticed that they would target, at some gun rally we'd have, there'd be an old guy
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.380]  in a wheelchair, and they'd like push him over, or there'd be an old guy, we have some
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:56.860]  of this from our abortion protest years ago, there'd be a guy on crutches, you know, that
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:00.580]  has a nerve, and they would go knock him down, and then we'd run over there to knock him
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:05.340]  upside the head, and they'd run, and it's like, archetypally, you think of the ultimate
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:09.300]  coward, hitting a woman in the back of the head, a big group dragging a woman into a
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:13.820]  crowd, beating her up, stomping her face in, we have all these videos, and then you think
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:20.140]  of the image of the ultimate coward being groups of men, beating up disabled people
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:23.980]  and women, and then that's who they are, and we've seen all the mainstream media praise
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:28.940]  them, and then say, you're the terror group, when the FBI never even said it, it's just
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.740]  incredible, so whoever wants to take that question, you know, here's what we talk to
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:37.740]  you guys. Well, I'll jump in real quick, I haven't
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:45.700]  experienced anything violent yet, I have gone out and gone to events where there was openly
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:51.740]  communist here in St. Petersburg, Florida, I'm in Tampa, Florida, but I did go to the
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:57.740]  Alex Jones rally, and I was expecting there to be opposition there, it's funny how Antifa
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:02.500]  isn't getting that George Soros money anymore, and if you remember Alex, I was the guy at
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:07.100]  the end that gave you the t-shirt that said Trump Pence 2020, and I took a picture with
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:12.180]  you, and I told you to rev your engine from the Hellcat.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:19.260]  You like that? I love that Hellcat, it's awesome, it's awesome, but when it comes to these cowards
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:26.780]  out there, imagine, imagine what would happen if we didn't stand up now and speak up now,
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.540]  we're just going to let them do what they want, what's going to happen when they send
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:35.180]  in the hit teams dressed like Antifa to take people like us out, because we're labeled
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:41.260]  offensive, or we're labeled racist or white supremacists just for loving America.
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:42.260]  Rufio?
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:46.260]  It's crazy, you know, we've got to put a compilation together, I've been talking about this couple
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:52.620]  of years, we haven't done it, I don't know why, whatever, of just the Antifa violence,
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:57.780]  because it's so incredible that one has to, but I know a lot of it doesn't get on tape.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:03.380]  Rufio, what have you experienced personally? I mean, there's at least 10 videos of people
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.580]  trying to hit you with steel clubs and you knocking them out, we always just show one
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:10.780]  clip, but there's at least 10 videos I've seen, and if the hair lips the admiral, we're
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:14.220]  going to put that together and be airing that soon, but what are some of the things
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.220]  that weren't caught on tape?
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:25.020]  Well, you know, there's been a lot of incidents, there's an incident in Seattle after a rally
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:31.100]  where we were attacked and one of my guys was hit over the back of the head with a glass
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:38.740]  bottle, and you know, he could have easily been killed or severely injured, thank God,
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:43.300]  he was, you know, the bottle broke over his head evenly and it was fine, but I mean, it's
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:49.300]  just another example, I've seen women pepper sprayed in the face, unarmed, doing nothing,
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:58.020]  I've seen women, and I've seen those jumps by, you know, three men, three grown men,
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:04.340]  and if we weren't there, I mean, you know, I know it sounds kind of boastful, but I can
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:07.940]  always say that, you know, Proud Boys and other like-minded patriot groups, their presence
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:13.620]  being at some of these events, it's potentially saved some people's lives or at least from
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.620]  severe injury.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:21.340]  And again, how do these men do this, like a man like you or I, this normal man gets physically
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:25.620]  angry when they see this, you can't even believe it's happening, but they do it on purpose,
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:30.580]  I've personally seen them do it, I've seen it all over the internet, where they will
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.500]  just beat it, like roundhouse kick a woman in the head for no reason, and then the media
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.420]  praises it.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:43.100]  They're pathetic, they are truly pathetic, I don't understand how people can sit back
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:48.020]  and not speak up, or they can't see who the enemy is by now, I don't call them Democrats
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.420]  anymore, I don't call them liberals, they're fake liberals, and they're the anti-American
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:56.820]  party, they go out, look at this, I mean, this is disgusting, anybody should be upset
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:00.660]  right now, you know, they go out and they say that they're for women, they're for children,
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:03.420]  but they want to kill their babies, they're Satanists, they go over there to do these
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:09.740]  rituals, and you've caught the A team, we call them, the abortion team, on tape, you've
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:14.900]  experienced this, and you know, it's sick, it's just sick, these people are anti-American
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:18.780]  at the end of the day, I think they're just Satanists, or they're just paid losers, they're
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:23.900]  paid to go out there and run amok, and we all know who's funding all this crap.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.340]  By the way, we don't just say George Soros, every time I dig down to the bottom, it's
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:36.220]  him, I mean, he's the one funding the lawsuits against me, he just says, this guy's incredible.
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:40.700]  You know, we started the Times of Liberty show to keep hammering, hammering, hammering,
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:45.100]  like you say, hammering, we want to talk about the fluoride in the water, we want to talk
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:50.020]  about CNN as an S-hole, we want to talk about the geoengineering that wasn't, that was a
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:55.860]  conspiracy before, but now it's a solution, we want to talk about how on the Colbert show,
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:42:00.180]  the scientists went on there, geoengineering scientists, he admitted it kills up to a million
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:05.020]  people a year, and we want to talk about those things, the GMO in the water, we want to talk
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:10.500]  about these people are dressing up a little kids and putting them in pageants and bringing
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:14.140]  them out, you know, we have no problem with your sexuality at Times of Liberty, we don't
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:18.300]  care what color you are, we don't care what you are, all we care about is if you love
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.740]  that red, white, and blue, if you black back the country, and if you back President Trump,
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:25.860]  you don't have to agree with everything we say, that's not what we're about, we're not
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.980]  a call, if we're extremists, we're extreme about America, we're extreme about loving
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:33.260]  the Constitution, and that's what Ifa Woods has taught me, people come to me with that
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:37.940]  Q-Crap on my page and tell me, oh, you got to watch out with Alex Jones, he's probably
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:43.100]  a Mossad agent, well guess what, I like to write poems, and I read it on air, and Ifa
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.820]  Woods gave me a commercial with my poem, and when I called in and talked to you earlier
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:50.460]  this year, they gave me another commercial, two commercials, they didn't have to do that,
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:54.460]  you guys let me plug Titans of Liberty, that was before I even linked up with Rufio.
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:57.620]  The only agents we are is agents of liberty, brother.

[01:43:55.860 --> 01:44:01.960]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.540]  of many of our best selling items.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:06.820]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:10.100]  store wide, 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:16.260]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:20.340]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine, 4 to 5 super blue, you'll
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:25.060]  get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:28.260]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.260]  out.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:33.220]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.220]  sells out.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.540]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:41.860]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.380]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.020]  We are losing money on this.
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:46.460]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:49.740]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything and don't fight the crowds.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:54.820]  InfoHorstdoor.com, InfoHorstLive.com, or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:58.420]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:02.260]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.780]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:12.220]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:17.620]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:19.140]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:25.700]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:29.660]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.180]  in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.380]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:42.460]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:47.300]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:52.180]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.180]  supply.
[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:58.500]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:01.060]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:06.500]  Worth, family, friends and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.500]  mood.

[01:47:53.340 --> 01:48:04.820]  Well, I don't normally have 50 seconds of bumper music, but I was talking to Roger
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:09.260]  Stone about very exciting things behind the scenes.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:14.540]  Believe me, folks know that when I tell you we got a big show or a big surprise coming
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.620]  up, we deliver.
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:22.540]  So in the next week or so, you're going to want to be watching the show.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:26.520]  And then after that, you're going to want to be watching, because let's just say Sandy
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:33.180]  Claus is going to be bringing some very nice presents this year.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:40.940]  And I'm going to stop talking at that point, riding shotgun with us, Rufio had to go, or
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:44.780]  we're going to mail him an external mic for his audio, he's a wonderful patriot.
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:50.820]  We've got Jason, also known as Megatitan, and so let me do this, let me have you back
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:51.820]  up because you're amazing.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:54.820]  And in fact, as soon as I saw you, I know that guy, I've been following your work the
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:58.500]  last year and a half or so, a lot of it's super viral.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:03.020]  And so plug the new show Titans of Liberty, but also plug the big one you've been doing
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:04.020]  for a while.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:06.700]  The best way to plug Titans of Liberty is to plug the regular show you've already been
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.700]  doing.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.700]  Tell folks how they can find that.
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:09.700]  Okay.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:12.740]  Well, first of all, I just want to say you probably didn't notice me because I always
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:19.700]  wear this hat, this beautiful info wars dot com, baby.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:24.700]  And I just want to say, the Titans of Liberty News Wars is the media page.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:30.700]  My, I just did that because we have to get the news out there and we have to report what's
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.700]  going on.
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:37.140]  I mean, NASA just reported, was it yesterday, that they admitted that they had intelligent
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:41.980]  life, small human being, or alien beings here on earth before.
[01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:44.940]  But Megatitan was really a troll.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.260]  That's how it was born, Megatitan.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.260]  I like to make memes.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.180]  My Jason Low Page is my main page on Facebook now.
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:58.900]  I do have a real dot video, Megatitan, YouTube, Megatitan, at MAGA underscore Titan Twitter.
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:02.020]  But all of my funny videos, I like to do comedy too.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:05.620]  I know I seem very serious, but I like to bring light to the situation because that's
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:06.620]  what we need.
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.900]  There's no more comedy at night.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.820]  Stephen Colbert trash.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.500]  We all, we see Mr. Fake News think he's real news now.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.500]  It's just so sad.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.300]  You got Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:19.300]  And you know, I thought I was pretty funny, the whole pickle thing he did with you on
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:20.300]  Air Alex.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:26.340]  But at the same time, you know, they make everything a joke when we know it's for real.
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:30.660]  But the Megatitan page on Facebook is where you'll find my comedy.
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:36.020]  And also we have the Titans of Liberty Truth Wars Public Group.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.820]  So we have that as well.
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:39.380]  But that's basically it right there.
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:44.740]  If you want the comedy at Megatitan 1776, that's on Facebook, but we are going to move
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:45.740]  off of Facebook.
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:46.900]  I was using it for now.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:51.700]  If we get censored, we're going to start taping and putting it on real.video since I'm already
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:52.700]  set up there.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.100]  Thanks to the great Mike Adams.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:57.260]  I know he'll be adding the live feature on there soon.
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.260]  Okay, well, listen, you're awesome.
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:00.260]  Great work.
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.260]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:02.260]  God bless.
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:03.260]  Good job.
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:08.260]  So the proud boys were never said to be extremists by the FBI, but how, how could they then just
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:12.900]  designate someone as that and then have them removed from the internet?
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.980]  It shows where the left is going is very, very frightening.
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:17.340]  Now, Roger Stone has got to get on an airplane here in a few minutes.
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:21.980]  We've got a little bit of this segment and then the next segment coming up.
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:26.140]  But before we do that, just briefly, because I haven't plugged this hour, if I don't plug,
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.140]  we don't get funded.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:28.140]  We shut down.
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:29.140]  I'm our biggest problem.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:32.580]  When I plug, you buy the products, but I tend to get busy and don't do it.
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:33.580]  We have the biggest sales.
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:35.900]  I've been sending that for about two months because we're doing year in clearance.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:40.660]  These are the biggest sales in our history, double patriot points on every future order.
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:47.580]  You get 50 to 75% off, 50% off the lowest level of discount, store-wide and free shipping
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:48.740]  store-wide.
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.620]  And we've got the incredible ultimate bone broth, best formulation out there with the
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:58.180]  chaga mushroom, the turmeric, the bee pollen, everything.
[01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:03.100]  It's 50% off, but every order, whether it's an order, a brain force, or it's another
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:08.740]  t-shirt order or a water filter or whatever you order, you get a free limited edition.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:14.580]  We are all Alex Jones, don't censor me, Gadsden flag, black on white t-shirt.
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:16.740]  So take something like the bone broth.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:20.940]  In 1995, that's at cost.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:23.340]  Then you add free shipping, that's another $5.
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:25.700]  Then you add a $5 free shirt.
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.220]  We're losing a lot of money on this, but I want to get the t-shirts out there.
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:33.460]  So every order, every order at m4store.com, we'll get a free t-shirt.
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:37.780]  Now, this particular design, we only had like 5,000 of them, so it's going to be gone
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:38.780]  a day or two.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.260]  It'll be one of the other shirts we've got, and then another shirt, it'll be as those
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:45.900]  sell out, it'll be a new free shirt you get.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:52.860]  So m4store.com, or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9, your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:56.100]  Whatever you do, please spread the word about local radio stations and TV stations that
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.700]  you're listening and watching to.
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:02.020]  That is just as critical as financially supporting us while you get great products.
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:06.260]  Okay, Roger, thanks for waiting to go to the airport to pop in with us.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:09.180]  You're one of the top stories in the country.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:14.180]  We hear that General Flynn cooperated totally, so he's not going to get any jail time, Mueller
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:18.500]  says, and then we hear, you took the fifth and all the rest of this stuff, and what's
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.540]  really going on, Roger Stone?
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:27.260]  Well, Alex, I decided to invoke my Fifth Amendment rights pertaining to the Senate Intelligence
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:33.500]  and Judiciary Committees some time ago, and I informed them of that prior to the president's
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.500]  tweet.
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:40.620]  So those who say that, ah, you see this witness intimidation by Trump encouraged Stone not
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:42.620]  to cooperate, that's false.
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:43.620]  Why did I do so?
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:48.900]  Well, you know, I wanted to testify for the House Intelligence Committee in open session.
[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:51.700]  Let the American people see the whole thing.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.740]  I was not allowed to do so.
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.060]  I elected to cooperate anyway.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:54:02.420]  And since that time, Adam Schiff and Eric Swallows Well and Congressman Quigley and
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:06.900]  other lowlives on that committee have misrepresented what I said.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:12.540]  Let me be very clear, my testimony is entirely accurate and truthful.
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:17.500]  I did disclose that Randy Kredico, the New York Radio Talk Show host, was the source
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:20.700]  who told me about both the significance.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:27.260]  In the October disclosure date of the WikiLeaks matters, I completely reject the suggestions
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:34.940]  by the Special Counsel's Office to Dr. Jerry Corsi that he was any kind of source regarding
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.940]  WikiLeaks.
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:36.940]  We know that's all bull.
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:38.140]  I'm asking you about Flynn.
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:40.060]  I'm asking about the next shoot-a-drop.
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.060]  Trump is single.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.660]  He's taking the gloves off.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.380]  Yeah, we don't know anything about Flynn because so much of the document they released
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.740]  was redacted.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:52.820]  They say he cooperated, but they don't tell us the substance of his cooperation.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:58.360]  As far as I know, General Flynn is a great patriot, I believe that he was yukered, into
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:03.900]  pleading guilty to something he did not do, and I'm going to reserve judgment as to whether
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:09.340]  General Flynn has turned on the president or whether he has rendered any testimony that
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:11.380]  is harmful to the chief executive.
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.700]  We just don't know that yet.
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:17.380]  Sure, because they could just use him as a cutout and say, ooh, he told everybody, ooh,
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:20.700]  just like Joy Barr said, oh, he admits Trump's a Russian, they're all Russians.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:21.700]  That wasn't true.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:25.580]  They're using Flynn as a cutout because they know nothing was ever there to begin with,
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:26.580]  and I agree with you.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:30.380]  It looks like it's another replay of the same thing they've done before.
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:36.460]  Well, and during the time that Donald Trump is the president-elect and after General Flynn
[01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:41.860]  had been designated as the incoming national security advisor, it's well within the president's
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:46.980]  authority to direct him to speak to the Russian ambassador or anyone else.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:53.100]  So this notion that he did something, you know, illegal or improper, I'm just not seeing
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.100]  it.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.100]  Yes, yes, Roger.
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:58.660]  Everyone knows Russiagate's fake to try to overthrow the election and cover up for Hillary
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:00.140]  and Mueller that were involved with the Russians.
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:01.500]  I mean, everyone knows that.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:05.620]  I'm just getting to you because you're an expert and talked to a lot of people about
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:08.100]  when does Trump, he says he's taking the gloves off.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.420]  Well, we're ready.
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.420]  Don't wait.
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:11.420]  Let's go.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.420]  Let's go.
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.420]  Let's go.
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:18.740]  He's going to declassify all this material on the same day that Mr. Mueller issues his
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:19.900]  report.
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:23.540]  That would be quite a day if that is the case.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.980]  I don't know how he could have sent the signal more clearly in that New York Post interview
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:30.620]  that he has the detonator in his hands.
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:37.380]  He's got the goods on Bill and Hillary and Barack and Brennan and Clapper and Mueller
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:39.660]  and Rosenstein and others.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:42.900]  And he will unleash it at the time of his choosing.
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:49.180]  It would be brilliant political strategy to release it on the very day Mr. Mueller releases
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:53.260]  his report, although that would be speculation on my part.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:57.700]  The president does need to act in good time though, Alex, because if he waits until it
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:04.340]  is too late, then he will find himself besieged and the people he's surrounded him with in
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:07.460]  many cases cannot be counted on in the post.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:08.460]  That's right.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.460]  I mean, look, we know what he's got.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:10.460]  They've got Hillary's emails.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:12.300]  The NSA has it.
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:13.940]  We have the illegal warrants.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.940]  We have them spying.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.380]  We have Obama launching it.
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:19.140]  That's such a scandal that Obama's spied on the campaign.
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:23.380]  So he's got a lot to release, just like WikiLeaks timed it.
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:31.740]  I think he should release a major trudgeon, a major slice, a major juicy, every, let's
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:35.540]  say, Monday morning or Tuesday morning.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:39.500]  He'd muck or balance every week just a nice big juicy.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.180]  And let them try to say he doesn't have the power to do it.
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:42.740]  He does under the Constitution.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:47.300]  He needs to give them hell now, attack.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:51.660]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage.
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:55.540]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now, if you're not in the market for one of

[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:10.220]  would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:16.060]  their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:38.100]  off.

[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:44.940]  all again for making the entire Info War possible.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:47.860]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:59:47.860 --> 02:00:12.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:18.860]  All right, I'm going to open the phones up, I'm going to open the phones up in the next
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:20.860]  segment to cover all the breaking news that's taking place.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:21.860]  Roger Stones here with us.
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:26.740]  A lot of people ask, hey, you've already done two hours of broadcast today, David Knight
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:27.740]  three hours before that.
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:34.820]  Why haven't you played more of George Walker Bush's funeral because it's painful for me
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:35.820]  to look at.
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:42.540]  I mean, this is Mr. David Rockefeller's minion, the globalist, all the things he did.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:43.540]  That's what I'm thinking about.
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.540]  It makes my head spin.
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:51.300]  The war crimes, the anti-gun, the open borders, the selling us out to China, giving us the
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.300]  Clintons.
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:57.220]  I mean, it's just, it's monstrous and Roger Stones is the best selling author of the
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:01.100]  Bush crime family and, you know, he worked for him, you know, he did stuff for him.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:06.140]  So, you know, he's one to know, but he got his soul back the last 15 years exposing him,
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:11.620]  which he did putting himself, you know, out there in the dark, you know, for doing it.
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:15.860]  But I see this footage of Trump walking by and the Clintons kind of jumping back.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:16.860]  Let's roll this footage.
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:18.020]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:24.020]  Here it is.
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:38.220]  Melania goes over to Obama and to Michael Obama and then Trump looks over at the Clintons
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:40.020]  and nothing happens.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:50.020]  I can't believe that Trump isn't loyal to their evil system and has already aced him.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:52.020]  He'll be so pissed.
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:54.580]  An amazing moment right there, Marcell.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:55.580]  Absolutely.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:56.580]  If you think about it.
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:03.500]  So, Roger, what do you, what do you make of that and just enclosing where this, where
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.500]  this, this fight is?
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.220]  Because we kept the Senate, we didn't get the House because of election fraud, populace
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.220]  just wanted Spain.
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:14.060]  I mean, we've had, we've had 68 elections.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:17.020]  Only two have been lost to populist Venezuela.
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:20.940]  And then what happened here a month ago because of election fraud, this shows an invincible
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:23.340]  wave of nationalism.
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:28.500]  If fraud doesn't block it, you know, Alex, there is one segment from the Bush funeral
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.820]  that I really wish you would find and put on the air.
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:38.220]  And that's which American patriot Bob Dole struggles to his feet and salutes the passing
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:39.220]  chief executive.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:45.700]  Bob Dole never remembered the trilateral commission, never remember the council on foreign relations.
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:52.100]  An outsider from Kansas, a true conservative, a man who at 91 years old was stumping for
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:55.460]  the Trump Pence ticket through the Midwest.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:59.300]  There is no greater living American today than Senator Bob Dole.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:05.620]  And I know you basically ran his campaign and I like Bob Dole just, you know, overall,
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.300]  you know, they kind of put him in there to take a, take a dive, you know, he didn't know
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:11.620]  he was doing it to, to, uh, hair Clinton, but I didn't see that footage.
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:15.900]  I meant to play that, uh, boy, uh, how old is he now like 93?
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.620]  He would look like he's not doing too well.
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:20.220]  No, I think he's, he's in very poor health.
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:22.500]  It's amazing that he continues to hang on.
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:28.900]  But here's a man of enormous courage and enormous patriotism, a true American hero, not just
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:32.700]  in his military service, but in his service to his country.
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:35.260]  So today I want to salute Bob Dole.
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:39.060]  This was the most moving moment of the Bush funeral, in my opinion.
[02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:41.180]  You know, it's just funny how these things work.
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:44.660]  I read an article about his service in North Africa and then Italy was very similar to
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:46.300]  my dad's dad's service.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:50.060]  So definitely, uh, was, was some, some rough, rough going there for Bob Dole.
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:53.660]  He basically got cut in half by a German machine gun.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.940]  He was hit by a shell and they told him he would never walk again.
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:59.220]  He would never be able to feed himself.
[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:03.420]  He would never be able to dress himself and he struggled back not only to a brilliant
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:11.340]  career in the U S Senate, but to a true life of integrity, unlike the globalists, someone
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:13.500]  who believed in American sovereignty.
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:19.620]  Now it's a shame that by 1996 and he finally could win the nomination, his time had passed.
[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:25.780]  But I still believe today he could be the greatest living American and people forget
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:26.780]  he did support Trump.
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:27.780]  That's a good thing.
[02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:33.620]  Well, while the Bushes took a powder when George W and George HW were refusing to endorse
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:40.820]  him, at 93 years old, Bob Dole in a wheelchair is stumping through Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.020]  for the Trump Pence ticket.
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:45.500]  There's a man of real courage and real integrity.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:51.260]  So how old is he now, 93, he's the same age as W was, or HW?
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:52.260]  That sounds about right.
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:55.780]  I mean, given, uh, the enormous, Hey, Roger, great job.
[02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:56.780]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.580]  A few months in full wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:02.580]  our best selling items.
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:06.060]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:09.340]  storewide 50 to 75% off double Patriot points.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:16.060]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order, even if it's a tube
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:20.140]  of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine, four to five super blue, you'll get a free
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:24.260]  gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:27.540]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:28.540]  out.
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:32.460]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.460]  sells out.
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:35.780]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:41.100]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.620]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.260]  We are losing money on this.
[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:45.700]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:50.180]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything and don't fight the crowds in four store.com
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:54.100]  infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:05:54.100 --> 02:06:01.460]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:07.980]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report.
[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:19.620]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:38.900]  deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:42.580]  You know, I'm not going to screen your phone calls in this hour.
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:49.060]  All I'm going to do is ask you have a good, clear phone and you call in on a couple of
[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:50.060]  big items.
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:53.140]  I'm throwing out here, but just please call in on these three items.
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:56.220]  Number one, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:07:02.620]  I mean, you know, I thought I got a headache watching all the worship of John McCain, but
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:06.580]  George Herbert Walker Bush was even worse.
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:14.140]  I mean, this is the guy that helped put this country on the trajectory of deindustrialization,
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:22.100]  gun control, open borders, you know, narcotics trafficking, the finders group, child kidnapping
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:23.100]  with CIA.
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:29.180]  I mean, all these people kiss his ass because he's like super evil and a big murderer.
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:33.980]  It's like, wow, that's what some, so men just like bow down to murderous men.
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:37.540]  No, I'm not doing it.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:43.300]  I'm not bound down to them and that whole sycophantic swamp in DC that is so traitorous.
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.300]  I can't even imagine how bad it is.
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:48.900]  Every time I think I know how bad it is, it just gets worse.
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:50.300]  So what do you think of him?
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:51.300]  Maybe you disagree with me.
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:52.300]  I'm a bad guy.
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.420]  Lines are open.
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:55.420]  The big mega banks.
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:56.420]  I've got articles right here.
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:01.820]  I'm going to cover in a moment trying to plunge the economy, trying to threaten the UK, Italy,
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.820]  other nations that are trying to pull out of the global system.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:05.620]  They're saying, we'll plunge your economy.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:06.620]  We'll target you.
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:07.620]  That's in the news.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:09.820]  What do we do about that?
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:10.820]  Trump was right.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:11.820]  Raise all these interest rates.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.820]  Do all this.
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:13.820]  What do we do about the economy?
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:14.820]  They're doing it to kill our recovery.
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.380]  What do you make of that?
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:17.380]  That's exactly who we pull up.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:20.180]  Bill Maher, maybe next segment.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:22.380]  That was just four months ago.
[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:27.380]  He said, I hope we can plunge the economy and create a stock market crash to hurt Trump.
[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:29.340]  Jeez, man.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:34.380]  Talk about working against your interest.
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:38.820]  And then thirdly, I covered it in the first hour.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:42.700]  More big studies, more federal reserve study.
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:47.940]  More reserve study showing millennials don't just want communism, fascism or socialism.
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:53.100]  They just want authoritarianism where they believe it gives them something free.
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:09:00.820]  But on average, they're the lowest IQ, most unhealthy, poorest people.
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:07.020]  So of course they want your money, just like Venezuela or just like North Korea.
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:10.140]  They have no idea what planet they're even living on.
[02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:16.180]  Just like corporate media and the whole digital bubble that's imploding, all these thousands
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:20.140]  of establishment sites that almost no viewers, you'd see the order go out from media matters
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:21.620]  in George Soros.
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:24.820]  And within hours, they would all rewrite word for word what was said.
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:28.220]  They just change it around a little bit and put the lie out.
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:29.500]  It didn't matter what it was.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:35.620]  It was usually about me or Trump or somebody to create this artificial consensus.
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:38.580]  And now they're shutting them all down.
[02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:43.860]  The Neocon Weekly Standard, Vox, Vice, all of it's either massive layoffs or just shutting
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:50.740]  down because there's no need for you once all the competition's censored off the internet,
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:52.740]  dumbasses.
[02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.260]  You were just there to create that artificial consensus.
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:57.260]  Now you're gone.
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:03.140]  But they'll have a new job for you to graduate down to being a local commissar at the university.
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:06.460]  They'll put you in charge of the student newspaper, making sure they don't criticize.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:10.220]  You know, they'll devolve your job down to nothing and you'll watch your whole country
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:12.380]  go to hell.
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:13.380]  But you don't care.
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:16.460]  You don't want real power.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:17.980]  You don't want real leadership.
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:23.580]  You don't want to see laboring in the fields against the wind, incredible crops of human
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:25.660]  potential sprouting.
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:30.380]  You want the dead crops of tyranny as long as you think you're the head skeleton in charge
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:33.500]  of it.
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:38.940]  So the out-of-control web censorship now coming home to risk for the establishment, George
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:44.300]  Robert Walker Bush lying in state now being sent to Texas to be buried, God, the carpet
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:50.100]  bagging never ends.
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:52.180]  It's mind boggling, isn't it?
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:56.860]  And of course, the subject of the attempt to openly kill the economy.
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:11:01.180]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789.
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:04.100]  I haven't given the number out and I see the phone lines are loaded.
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:07.820]  That's kind of a crazy sign there, but let's do this.
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:10.900]  Let's keep Kevin and Brandon on hold.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:15.620]  But let's kill those other lines real quick because let's just kill them, kill them.
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:19.060]  I'm trying to be good here to get new callers or people that haven't got a chance to get
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.060]  on here.
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:22.340]  Okay, the race is on.
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:29.500]  I want to hear from you, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:32.580]  And if you're a first-time caller or you've been on hold, never got on the air, hadn't
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:40.460]  been on the air in say a year, I want to give you a chance to get on air, 877-789-2539.
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:52.660]  And as negative as a lot of this news is, the good news is, humanity is awake and nationalism
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:54.220]  is exploding right now.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:58.100]  But just look at these headlines.
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:05.240]  Today, you've got big corporate media that has almost no readers or viewers rubbing their
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:11.780]  hands together and saying, we need to de-platform all the nationalists and we need to take Trump
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:13.500]  off Twitter too.
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:20.020]  And they also admit everyone's for sale, except those that aren't for sale, a generation
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:27.820]  of digital media darlings, perhaps for a frigid winner, vice, vox, buzzfeed, among other companies,
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:32.660]  that once, I mean, criminal syndicates, heralded the dawn of the new media age.
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:37.220]  Oh yeah, where you shut everybody down and you're on air, are now grappling with decidedly
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:41.020]  old media problems.
[02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:47.260]  Milo Yiannopoulos' collab shows that no platforming can work, they have other articles saying,
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:54.860]  since Jones has no platforming, has been successful, since Mark Twain's dead, and of course they
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.980]  attacked me in this article too, they say, we can get them all.
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:02.580]  No, I'm not funded by the Mercers, I'm funded by the listeners and viewers.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:07.900]  We're on hundreds of radio and TV stations and our core audience is bigger than ever.
[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:13.900]  But our reach to new people has been stunted unless the audience takes action.
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:19.180]  Continuing, he who must not be named, what M4 war is Alex Jones and Voldemort have in
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:25.180]  common and says, now that he's successfully been de-platformed, we can talk about him.
[02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:30.300]  And it's some weird lady from Turkey who left authoritarianism to come here and bring it
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.700]  to us as a college professor.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:37.460]  Yeah, you pay to send your young people to college to learn to hate America, to learn
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:41.460]  how to censor, there's articles everywhere about student newspapers, if they're critical
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:45.660]  of anything that school does, they're shut down.
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:50.380]  Some school is about murdering truth, about murdering questioning.
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:54.860]  It's all about having matriarch media say the proud boys are listed as terrorists and
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:58.980]  turns out the FBI never said it.
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:03.660]  But that's how this works.
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:10.420]  But they're not going to win, the globalists aren't going to win, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:13.180]  Truth is on our side.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:16.620]  But I did want to hit this little piece of news and we'll do it after we take a raft
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.820]  of calls.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:19.820]  Just the latest.
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:24.180]  Now they're targeting your two-year-olds, weirdos that come to the school when you're
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:29.300]  not there, talk to your two-year-old about sex and their sexuality, and she's usually
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:33.780]  a potbellied man in a weird outfit and it's like, oh, men come to talk to my child about
[02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:37.220]  sex as long as it's liberal, it's okay.
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:41.100]  Think about how far this has gone.
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:45.420]  Women governments have been caught putting out brochures that tell kids to spy on their
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:51.300]  right-wing parents as young as age five if they don't agree with them having their testicles
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:54.100]  chopped off.
[02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:55.100]  It's all coming up.
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:56.780]  We're going to break.
[02:14:56.780 --> 02:15:01.980]  Please remember that George Soros has tried to shut down all of our merchant accounts
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:06.900]  and even though we were able to get more when he shut down five of the six, I'm not operating
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:11.300]  as if we'll be here six months from now, even though I intend to be.
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:16.340]  So we have quite a warehouse of great products, and I usually keep enough to have stuff in
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:17.340]  January and February.
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:24.380]  Well, this year it'll be slim pickets because everything must go 50 to 75% off store-wide,

[02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:43.140]  Don't fight the mall crowds.
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:45.940]  Just go to infowarstore.com and I forgot the biggest part of the deal.
[02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:51.980]  On top of free shipping, 50% off, a free, we're all Alex Jones, don't censor me, shirt with

[02:16:54.820 --> 02:17:00.180]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:01.180]  the world.
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.220]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:10.180]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:13.980]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:14.980]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.540]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:19.420]  The deep state began with World War I.
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:24.900]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:26.100]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:30.020]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.580]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:34.540]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:37.820]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:04.860]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:09.020]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright

[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:24.500]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:29.740]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy,
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:36.700]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:27.020]  All I want for Christmas is to not live under the mark of the beast, you know, the big banks,
[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:31.220]  the chai comms, Facebook, Twitter, Google, they all think they just invented this new
[02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:36.540]  plan to have a face scan or hand scan and then track everything you do and if you're not
[02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:40.300]  a good globalist, you can't buy yourself.
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:43.980]  They thought that they just invented this new ultimate class system, but you know, 2,000
[02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:48.820]  plus years ago, the Bible, the New Testament was written, the book of revelations.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:51.620]  Here it is, it just went up on Infowars.com.
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:56.220]  It's a new horrifying Kit Daniels article, I hope you get it out to folks.
[02:20:56.220 --> 02:21:01.740]  Mastercard, the same folks working with the ADL, the band conservatives off the Internet,
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:06.780]  using the digital system to ban people like Hitler did Jews, Mastercard, Microsoft developed
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:11.980]  digital identity system and your new global social score.
[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:15.700]  Critics blast frightening plan as a system of a totalitarian regime can only dream of
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:20.300]  and there's a race now with all the big tech giants to get little robots in your house
[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:26.780]  like Alexa that spy on you and Google assistant and it's all happening, the microchipping,
[02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:30.260]  the whole thing we warned you of and that's why we're so discredited.
[02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:34.940]  It's why we've got to be taken off air because we're right so much.
[02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:40.220]  You can't have people warning about this, that Tim Cook has slave factories or Tim Cook's
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:45.900]  become state run in China or that China is putting spy devices on Apple devices.
[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:52.380]  No, no, you just go to the ADL who is my, you know, Soros and wants to overthrow Israel
[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:56.620]  and you just talk about everyone's an anti-Semite that doesn't want to go into the mark of the
[02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:57.620]  beast.
[02:21:57.620 --> 02:21:58.620]  Isn't that nice?
[02:21:58.620 --> 02:21:59.620]  Isn't that sick?
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:02.900]  Isn't that disgusting of these soulless leftists?
[02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:09.900]  God help us and now they want our children from the US to Sweden, state run, kindergarten,
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:16.180]  fans, the word he, she makes boys wear dresses, in Germany they hand out brochures saying
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:19.500]  your parents don't want you to wear dresses or have your testicles chopped off their right
[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:20.500]  wangers.
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:23.060]  They've got Cigar police ready to come after you.
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:25.660]  That's on info wars.com today.
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:30.060]  That's right, we're gonna have adults come talk to your children as young as age two
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:34.940]  about their sex, about their genitals and if you don't like it, the ADL is coming for
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:35.940]  you.
[02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:40.020]  You're not with Hitler are you?
[02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:44.380]  Well, no, I'm not with Soros, you give awards to exactly and then you ain't with Hitler,
[02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:47.300]  you ain't nobody according to the ADL.
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:23:00.900]  Now we learn the secret in World War II.
[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.500]  I said I'd go to your calls from about to go there, I'm about to go there, I'm about
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:09.460]  to go there, here, type in haratz, haritz.com, just type it in the search term and then say
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:19.380]  meet the SS Nazi who worked for Mossad and this is not an attack on Mossad or any of
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.660]  us, it just shows where this goes and I already knew about it.
[02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:25.060]  He was the, all the most dangerous man in Europe, he was the head of the SS commando,
[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:31.060]  you know, that was a major, major, you know, colonel, it's called a major colonel in the
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:36.860]  Germans, not a full colonel and there it is, the strange case of the Nazi who became an
[02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:43.860]  Israeli hit man, there it is, here, let's scroll down and look at Otto and see the story
[02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:50.700]  kind of begins there, you see, because there were a few thousand Jews in Europe who worked
[02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:58.820]  with Hitler and they helped rob all the other Jews, Magdalene Albright's father reportedly
[02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:05.940]  stole more than 100 billion today's numbers from Jews, he was Jewish, but let's just stop
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:16.140]  right there, we'll talk about the ADL another day, disgusting, truly disgusting, but we'll
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:23.340]  get to that another time, very sick, see if you help round up and kill Jews and you're
[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:29.100]  Jewish, it's a good thing, like Soros, but if you'd ever hurt a Jew in your life, you're
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:37.420]  bad and then these evil people in the name of Jews go out and do horrible things and
[02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:41.260]  they get all these other people angry to then attack normal regular Jews who aren't involved
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:47.500]  in this and then those regular normal Jews run to the actual evil people that are setting
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:59.060]  them up and give them all their money, in a protection racket, isn't that sick, but it's
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:05.580]  not if you're Jewish, Soros, it's fun, and if you're a radio listener, the crew just
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:14.340]  in seconds just search engines what I said and found it, and of course that Haritz Harat
[02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:23.340]  story is a very small amount of the real story about that particular fellow, that particular
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:30.180]  fellow, let's see, my family lives in Texas and some of them were in the military and
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:38.660]  some of them were in other groups and they were ordered to be around these people, so
[02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:47.260]  I didn't need to read about it in a Jewish newspaper to know about it, oh no, I didn't
[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:53.780]  have to read about it in a newspaper, I heard all about it growing up, and imagine your
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:26:00.620]  little kid and your mom's like, your grandfather's a little eccentric, he wasn't eccentric, he'd
[02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:09.580]  seen it, but that's the word they use when you're like, you fight and you help kill
[02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:17.820]  Hitler and by alchemy you become Hitler, and the people that helped Hitler, they become
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:25.060]  the guardians of the Jews, and then Benjamin Netanyahu says we're not going to do this,
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:37.580]  oh and he's now anti-Semitic, sick, of course you know most of Benjamin Netanyahu's family
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:41.460]  has died fighting for Israel, and I'm not here to lionizing Benjamin Netanyahu, but
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:45.180]  because I'm always being attacked as being a Assad agent, which I have no connections
[02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:48.900]  to Israel, I have a connection to history and reality, I will then start exposing all
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:54.380]  this because I'm sick of it, I'm getting real tired of the ADL and your crap, you know damn
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:27:00.580]  well what you've been up to, shame on you, none of you got killed fighting people trying
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:07.740]  to blow up Israel, you all sit around working with Iran and working with Obama and working
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:15.060]  with people, let me tell you Israel's biggest problem is leftist Jews, God, because we all
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:18.060]  know about leftists, they can be black, they can be Hispanic, they can be white, they'll
[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:32.340]  sell their mother out for a stick of bubblegum, alright, if the water doesn't rise we'll go

[02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:04.460]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes some of them
[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:08.140]  were like little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWarsStore that just showed
[02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:12.900]  our products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump
[02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:15.900]  rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:19.420]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[02:31:19.420 --> 02:31:20.980]  and the world back from the brick.
[02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:25.660]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:27.140]  pesky in the future.
[02:31:27.140 --> 02:31:32.900]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:37.180]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way.
[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:41.140]  I've committed to do that, I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen
[02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:46.340]  but you've got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver
[02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:50.900]  at the spiritual level, I physically will but I give you my commitment if you financially
[02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:51.900]  support us.
[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:56.260]  InfoWarsStore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:31:56.260 --> 02:32:03.180]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:06.700]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper, it consists
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:08.980]  of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:13.340]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions,
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:19.420]  they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights
[02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:20.420]  from us as individuals.
[02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:26.660]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:26.660 --> 02:32:31.180]  We have seen what they want to do, they called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN
[02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:32.180]  2030 Agenda.
[02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:36.940]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they
[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:42.420]  want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control
[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:43.420]  everyone.
[02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:59.540]  It's the David Knight Show, at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:32:59.540 --> 02:33:18.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:37.420]  For back live, ladies and gentlemen, doesn't matter if you live in Japan, Russia, Chile,
[02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:42.860]  the United States, there are always going to be people that want to sell you out to
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:43.860]  special interest.
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:46.260]  There's always going to be people that want to stand up for what's right.
[02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:50.340]  Let's go to your phone calls right now on the three big topics, the globalists openly
[02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:56.420]  trying to plunge the world economy, and that is on record, we'll cover some of those stories.
[02:33:56.420 --> 02:34:01.700]  The riots going on all over the world, the George Herbert Walker Bush lying in state
[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:07.780]  now being shipped back down here to Texas for more ceremonies at college station, I
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:13.540]  guess it's sunset tonight and where you see all this going.
[02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:20.260]  We should just start at the top because on whatever millennial stats earlier, now they're
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:24.140]  on average, not all millennials are like this.
[02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:28.260]  Communist fascist socialists, they want authoritarianism.
[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:31.380]  They don't want to work, but they want to run your life.
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:33.380]  Kevin in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:34.380]  Thanks for calling.
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:35.380]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:36.380]  Welcome.
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:42.020]  Well, sir, I would like to say I appreciate you letting me get on your show.
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:44.820]  I've been listening for about 15 years now.
[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:51.900]  I'm 33 years old, I have a family of my own, I'm very successful in life, I'm a Bible
[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:58.140]  believing Christian, and I believe in this country, but also I believe that some of that
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:04.340]  demographic that you gave out earlier could be a lot of disinformation, largely because
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:09.860]  of the friends that I've graduated with, almost everyone in my graduating class are now business
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:15.300]  owners and own their own homes, and we've been pretty successful.
[02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:22.020]  I guess it's because of the way we were raised in the South and Louisiana where I'm from.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:26.180]  So outside from that, I'm just here to spread a little hope to you, let you know that we're
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:30.740]  all here fighting for you and believing for the cause of saving this country and promoting
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:33.540]  liberty and freedom.
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:39.220]  And trust me, a lot of it is just mere campaign to bring people down and keep their mind off
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:42.020]  of the task of bringing things forward.
[02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:45.940]  Well, I tend to agree with you that a lot of polls are skewed toward the left, you're
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:47.820]  absolutely right.
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:52.260]  And I think if you are in a conservative or Christian area, millennials are some of the
[02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:53.260]  best people out there.
[02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:55.740]  In fact, some of the best folks I know are millennials, a lot of our crews are millennials.
[02:35:55.740 --> 02:35:58.860]  I mean, I'm not much past when I'm 45.
[02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:03.580]  And Generation Z is super awake, but that doesn't mean there aren't some bad guys in
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:04.740]  there.
[02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:10.260]  But in general, in blue city areas and blue state areas, the millennials are when you
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:14.140]  go out, the Antifa, I mean, they're the most whacked out group there is.
[02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:18.420]  And so I think these polls are skewed like you're saying, but you know, when you get
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:23.860]  40 something percent, say I want to be a socialist and 10% want to be a communist and 10% want
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:24.860]  to be a fascist.
[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:29.100]  I mean, I think it does illustrate that there is that type of group out there.
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:31.420]  So yeah, I mean, I think you're right, they're skewing the numbers, but it's still pretty
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:32.420]  bad.
[02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:37.900]  Yes, sir, well, let me ask you this in general, I mean, what do you see in your area in New
[02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:38.900]  Mexico?
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:43.140]  Because I mean, I agree, Trump and Americana is way more popular than they're saying.
[02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:44.540]  They clearly stole the last election.
[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:45.540]  We have the evidence.
[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:46.540]  I agree.
[02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:51.340]  But what do you do when every other election worldwide goes for capitalism, nationalism,
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:54.580]  Christianity, but Venezuela and America?
[02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:59.380]  Well, for what I see in New Mexico and what I have seen, I used to work for a telecom
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:05.820]  company here and almost every customer that I went to was pro America and completely against
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:08.860]  the Clinton agenda and what they were pushing.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:12.540]  Now as far as where it's headed, I think it's on a biblical scale, man, honestly, because
[02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:17.060]  you know, the Bible says that when evil runs rampant in the world, the spirit of the Lord
[02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:21.500]  raises a standard against it and I believe that we are that standard against it.
[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:24.380]  And the enemy knows that its days are done.
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:29.220]  So as far as New Mexico is concerned, I think that they stole the midterms from us because
[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:30.220]  there's no doubt.
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:31.220]  Absolutely.
[02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:32.220]  God bless you, Kevin.
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:33.220]  Great points.
[02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:38.820]  Listen, I don't focus on the negative to be negative.
[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:44.620]  I focus so we don't get complacent, but I agree with you that world government, cashless
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:50.340]  society, Mark and the Beast, even if you don't believe in God or Christianity or it's happening,
[02:37:50.340 --> 02:37:54.620]  it's being done to control us and out of the gates, big tech is abusing their power like
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:56.780]  we knew they do.
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:38:00.900]  So all I'm saying is, I know in your towns and cities, you think you're secure, you're
[02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:05.380]  around a bunch of other normal people, you're not in Austin, Texas, you're not in San Francisco
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:10.220]  and these people in Austin, Texas and San Francisco and in DC and New York, there are
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:14.060]  a lot of good folks in Austin, a lot of good folks in DC, a lot of good folks in New York,
[02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:18.700]  but the people running the show are bad actors.
[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:23.780]  So I'm just shooting up the bat signal to everybody here that here's why a lot of people
[02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:28.020]  thinking me for how great I am, this is self preservation.
[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:29.340]  I want to do a better job for you.
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:30.940]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:35.740]  I appreciate you listening for 15 years and I don't want to be like, oh, we're glad Alex
[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:36.740]  is out there.
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:37.740]  He'll handle it.
[02:38:37.740 --> 02:38:45.740]  I've said this 5,000 times, I'll say it again, you are the power.
[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:48.140]  It's you.
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:52.460]  They don't like info wars because it's a focal point for you.
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:59.180]  They don't like things like DrudgeReport.com because if Obama said you can keep your doctor
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:02.860]  and then two years later, say he never said it, Drudge wouldn't do a thing.
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:07.260]  He just put two links up showing what Obama did.
[02:39:07.260 --> 02:39:09.580]  They don't like that memory.
[02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:16.420]  So Drudge acts is like a memory and info wars acts is kind of like a motivator and they
[02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:18.100]  just don't want that.
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:25.220]  And so that's why I've got to continue to bring up the negative points.
[02:39:25.220 --> 02:39:26.220]  Let's talk to Griff in Utah.
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:28.540]  Everybody wants to talk about millennials than Bush's death.
[02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:31.820]  Griff in Utah, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:32.820]  What's going on Alex?
[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:33.820]  How you doing bud?
[02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:35.540]  I am doing super good talking to you brother.
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:36.540]  All right.
[02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:37.540]  That's great.
[02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:38.540]  All right.
[02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:39.540]  So I wanted to talk about the millennials.
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:43.140]  So I work with a ton of them day in, day out.
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:47.180]  There's one particular one that I really want to focus on because I had a debate.
[02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:49.100]  I was using the tomorrow's news today model.
[02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:54.260]  He always makes fun of me, but he loses his like a time-bottom trolling and I love doing
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:59.300]  it, but he likes being a slave because he doesn't want to stand up.
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:04.220]  He's afraid and he thinks that if he's a good boy, they're going to pass over him.
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:05.220]  Oh yeah.
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:08.660]  They get this reflected power like they even know we're right, but they go, but I'm with
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:09.660]  the system.
[02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:10.660]  You're going to lose.
[02:40:10.660 --> 02:40:11.660]  Exactly.
[02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:14.900]  And it's terrifying to me because it's like, wow.
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:20.140]  All of you guys are focused on talking about socialism, talking about how it's helping
[02:40:20.140 --> 02:40:24.040]  society and all that, but yet they don't want to go back to work and help the other guys
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:28.700]  work in on the project, which is weird.
[02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:33.860]  But anyway, it's just the thing about this guy is that he's a coward.
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:37.660]  He's scared and I'm trying to wake him up.
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:39.900]  He listens to Joe Rogan and I'm like, wow.
[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:44.420]  So you listen to a guy that knifed Alex Jones in the back when he was your friend.
[02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:50.700]  I mean, I don't want to say anything bad about Joe Joe's entertainer.
[02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:56.100]  He's even said it, but then he says, oh, let's open the borders up to this migrant invasion.
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:59.900]  And then Eddie Bravo says, Joe, you live in a gated community, Joe, you live in a gated
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:00.900]  community.
[02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:01.900]  And you know, it's just right there.
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:03.780]  And look, hey, and I get it.
[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:04.780]  Joe's not a warrior.
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:05.780]  Joe said it.
[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:09.100]  He's entertainer and he wants to kind of be on the hind end of what's left of Hollywood.
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:10.100]  I wish him well.
[02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:12.100]  It's good for him.
[02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:13.100]  Exactly.
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:18.380]  I don't know how to get through his head that he's, he's not going to be protected.
[02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:22.660]  He's, he thinks that he will be protected if he's a good slave, but he's going to get
[02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:23.660]  it bad.
[02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:28.340]  I think I'd rather drop dead than live under the system that they're bringing in.
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:34.420]  Well, everybody keeps betting on the system and, you know, because they think they've
[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:35.420]  got something to lose.
[02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:38.620]  What they're losing is their soul by always being supportive of it.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:39.620]  And I'm not bashing Joe.
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:40.620]  Joe's right.
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:42.500]  He's not a revolutionary.
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:43.500]  He's not.
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:44.500]  He's, he's doing entertainment.
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:46.700]  And so I respect that.
[02:41:46.700 --> 02:41:49.260]  I mean, and, you know, Joe told me, he said, listen, I'm entertainer.
[02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:50.620]  I don't want to be in the fight.
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:54.340]  So he's just a guy that talks about fighting and being tough and then, you know, but then
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:57.060]  actually isn't that world, which is fine.
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:58.060]  That's fine.
[02:41:58.060 --> 02:41:59.140]  So in fact, Joe's a great guy.
[02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:00.140]  Let's just take him off though.
[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:03.660]  I don't want to look at him.
[02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:06.540]  There are a lot of people when the rubber meets the road, they're going to put their
[02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:11.300]  tail between their legs and piss all over themselves and that's fine.
[02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:13.060]  It's not our job to worry about them.
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:14.060]  It's our job to move on.
[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:15.060]  But you're right.
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:19.020]  The average millennial doesn't know that once the globalists take over, they're the first
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:21.180]  group that'll be targeted.
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:26.660]  I appreciate your call, Riff, and I got to move quick because we have a guest host coming
[02:42:26.660 --> 02:42:31.140]  up and I want them to be able to get their air time here on air today.
[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:32.460]  I actually pulled my sheet out.
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:34.380]  Who's doing the fourth hour today, guys?
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:37.380]  So I can plug that place.
[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.980]  Oh my God.
[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:39.980]  I totally forgot.
[02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:44.620]  Adam's has this bombshell report I totally agree with on the geoengineering, which they
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:45.620]  first denied.
[02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:48.620]  Now they totally admit and they're already terraforming the earth.
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:54.140]  This report is the most important thing we've probably ever covered when it comes to the
[02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:55.460]  planet's atmosphere.
[02:42:55.460 --> 02:42:59.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:04.540]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:06.060]  to detoxify the body.
[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:08.420]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:10.940]  Big metal and chemical defense support.
[02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:12.460]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:17.380]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:19.220]  the body and it supports the info war.
[02:43:19.220 --> 02:43:21.460]  It is a classical 360 win.

[02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:30.620]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:31.620]  get.

[02:45:56.420 --> 02:46:00.500]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:04.700]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with

[02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:16.260]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:35.180]  Again, a lot of people think about how do they advance their own personal agenda, which
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:39.020]  is fine as long as you promote the agenda of freedom.
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:42.540]  Those two work together, that's great, but if you try to promote your own agenda at the
[02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:46.420]  expense of other people's freedom, well then you're a tyrant, you're an idiot too because
[02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:52.180]  all that does is create the breakdown of society.
[02:47:52.180 --> 02:47:55.100]  We'll go right back to your phone calls.
[02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:58.020]  We've got a caller, Sovereign Millennial, we're going to go to him in a minute, we've
[02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:02.420]  got Stefan of Pennsylvania, we've got Cody, we've got Brandon, we've got Robert, we've
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:03.420]  got so many others.
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:08.460]  Stefan of Pennsylvania, let's talk about George Herbert Walker Bush's death and the three plus
[02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:16.180]  day extravaganza, he sure didn't like American sovereignty, he sure didn't like American power,
[02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:21.820]  but boy, before they get ready to stick him in the Texas dirt, which I love folks from
[02:48:21.820 --> 02:48:24.940]  up north, it's just that him posing as a Texan is pretty annoying.
[02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:29.180]  I don't go up to Kenny Buckport, Maine and say I'm, you know, from Texas or I'm from
[02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:32.940]  Maine, but I'm going to stop digressing.
[02:48:32.940 --> 02:48:35.660]  Stefan, what do you think about this whole situation?
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:41.980]  I don't know, Alex, I think it's just a big, I don't know, ploy to put everyone's face
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:47.980]  to make a coward who's responsible for deaths of millions of people, you know, as somebody
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:53.380]  who's a righteous man who did the right thing and, you know, made sacrifices that put, that
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:57.380]  basically, you know, made the country a better place, we're not, not the case at all.
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:49:02.700]  What he did is he sold us out to pretty much any, the highest bidder, and that goes the
[02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:07.620]  same for anybody in his clique, and as you can see, all those people that, you know, basically
[02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:14.260]  attended his funeral are the same ones that do just that, but not including Trump.
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:18.940]  As you can see, he's fighting every day harder and harder and against all the weight you
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:25.620]  can be pushed on him from the media and the corporations and the world leaders who aren't
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:26.620]  world leaders.
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:29.540]  I mean, it's pretty clear to see.
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:33.180]  Well, you're right, and it's not an ass-kissing contest, the president.
[02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:35.380]  I get attacked when I'm loyal to the president.
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:40.020]  I'm not like these globalists that, you know, get power from groveling to the system.
[02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:44.140]  I see Trump surrounded, I see him being steadfast, trying to do the best job he can.
[02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:48.580]  We see him make mistakes, try to fix them, and then to see the average American, even
[02:49:48.580 --> 02:49:52.940]  though clearly it's in their interest to support the president, buying into media hype, not
[02:49:52.940 --> 02:49:58.980]  all of them, but a large minority of people, particularly white, white trendies, is actually
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:03.460]  shameful that we have this many stupid people.
[02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:06.660]  It really is disappointing, and that's the millennial thing.
[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:11.580]  I mean, I and myself, I'm a millennial, but I can't relate to most people in my age group
[02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:17.300]  just because of their level of uninformed kind of bias that they just walk through life
[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:20.940]  thinking that everything is just, they're entitled to everything and they don't have
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:25.380]  to work for anything and that this magical system is just going to come forth and envelop
[02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:29.020]  them and aid them and give them comfort when really they're just trying to put them to
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:32.740]  sleep, so they, like a parasite, they can drain them of everything that they're worth,
[02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:33.740]  and that's what they want.
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:34.740]  They want a slave colony.
[02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:36.900]  They don't want free, free peoples.
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:40.940]  They want slaves, and that's not what America's about, so I think all these people need to
[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:46.300]  really find a new place that they can destroy because America's not that.
[02:50:46.300 --> 02:50:48.860]  Oh, you're right.
[02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:53.900]  And it's a philosophy that either the public's idiots go ahead and use them as food or the
[02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:57.220]  public is part of you, build them up, and the globalists have made that decision, the
[02:50:57.220 --> 02:51:01.540]  public's a bunch of scum, but they themselves become a scum.
[02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:02.540]  God bless you.
[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:06.300]  I'm going to take more calls, but it's six after Mike Adams is going to take over.
[02:51:06.300 --> 02:51:10.580]  He was going to cover this on Counterthink Sunday's 6 p.m. that premieres here on InfoWars,
[02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:16.940]  and he will as well, but here's the article, Transformation and Transforming has begun.
[02:51:16.940 --> 02:51:20.420]  Let's just do a document camp shot.
[02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:28.420]  People dimming is a plot to exterminate humanity by terraforming the atmosphere with smog pollution,
[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:32.820]  killing earth, food crops, and unleashing ecological collapse.
[02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:34.820]  And he goes over their documents, their admissions.
[02:51:34.820 --> 02:51:41.700]  It's not even our opinion that chemtrails are happening, but you see the list of things
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:44.460]  that a Joe Rogan show says.
[02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:45.860]  There is no chemtrails.
[02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:47.220]  George Soros fought Hitler.
[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:49.220]  He wasn't a collaborator.
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:51.500]  There is no world government.
[02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:53.260]  Open the borders to migrants.
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:54.260]  Which is great.
[02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:55.260]  Joe's entertainer.
[02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:56.260]  We get it.
[02:51:56.260 --> 02:51:57.260]  He's got sponsors.
[02:51:57.260 --> 02:51:58.260]  We're not.
[02:51:58.260 --> 02:51:59.740]  You'll read his article.
[02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:05.020]  It's filled with links to NASA and the Department of Energy with what's happening, and Trump
[02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:07.540]  needs to kill these earth dimming programs.
[02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:12.980]  NASA admits, BBC admits the earth is 30% darker than it was 40 years ago.
[02:52:12.980 --> 02:52:14.260]  They are manipulating it.
[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:16.060]  Now they're saying, get ready for the ice age.
[02:52:16.060 --> 02:52:20.860]  Let's show his article while we talk to the next caller.
[02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:26.340]  Let's just show his article on infowars.com or naturalnews.com and just slowly scroll
[02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:35.780]  through it and we'll show you whether or not to get ready for the ice age, which is what
[02:52:35.780 --> 02:52:38.220]  this whole cover will do.
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:44.100]  All right, let's go ahead and take some calls here.
[02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:46.020]  Let's talk to Jeffrey in California.
[02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:47.020]  You're on the air.
[02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:48.020]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:49.020]  Huge fan.
[02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:51.580]  I just wanted to tell you that I love what you do.
[02:52:51.580 --> 02:52:55.580]  I appreciate you enlightening the world and those of us that have the opportunity to listen
[02:52:55.580 --> 02:52:56.580]  to you.
[02:52:56.580 --> 02:53:02.340]  It's truly a blessing considering you don't have as much time as most do to advertise
[02:53:02.340 --> 02:53:03.340]  a thought.
[02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:04.340]  Give you a little bit of love.
[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:08.420]  I'm a huge fan of the Alpha Power, the Super Blue.
[02:53:08.420 --> 02:53:09.900]  The toothpaste was awesome.
[02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:11.660]  I love wearing the shirts around.
[02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:14.780]  I like to sugar in the snowflakes out here in Sacramento.
[02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:19.780]  So when I walk around downtown, I love wearing my InfoWars gear.
[02:53:19.780 --> 02:53:26.540]  When it comes to George Bush and the globalism, there's so many things that just jump into
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:27.620]  my mind.
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:32.300]  Him being involved with the killing of Kennedy, technically he's not involved, but he doesn't
[02:53:32.300 --> 02:53:35.980]  know where he was, but we all know where he was that day.
[02:53:35.980 --> 02:53:39.180]  The UN globalist deal, I know he was involved with the signing of the UNESCO.
[02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:40.780]  Oh, he signed us on to UNESCO.
[02:53:40.780 --> 02:53:42.780]  He signed us on the Biological Diversity Assessment.
[02:53:42.780 --> 02:53:45.100]  It would take half our land off.
[02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:48.860]  You name it, George W. Bush did it.
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:56.220]  George W. Bush raped America even more than Bill Clinton and Barack Obama combined.
[02:53:56.220 --> 02:54:02.140]  The more I've watched you and the more I've listened and not just tried to listen biasly,
[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:04.300]  I actually study a lot of what you say.
[02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:08.940]  When you bring things up, I go out and look at your links and it's just fascinating how
[02:54:08.940 --> 02:54:11.820]  involved these people are in everything.
[02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:17.660]  When you see it like the previous caller said, the funeral, you can see who his real fans
[02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:23.660]  were and who the people involved with this man were just by who showed up at his funeral.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:27.260]  And all of these people have helped slowly erode our country.
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.260]  Oh, no.
[02:54:28.260 --> 02:54:32.060]  And like Trump's like, we had all the power, even from a power position, why'd you do it?
[02:54:32.060 --> 02:54:36.580]  Because they hate the spirit of America and they sold our industry out.
[02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:38.860]  They did everything to screw the country.
[02:54:38.860 --> 02:54:43.860]  And Trump's saying, even from a power position, you'll negotiate better if we're powerful.
[02:54:43.860 --> 02:54:45.340]  He goes, why have you done this?
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:48.860]  Because we hate America, Bush.
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:49.860]  We hate America.
[02:54:49.860 --> 02:54:51.500]  That's what Bush stands for.
[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:52.500]  That's what he wants to do.
[02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:57.020]  Bush stands for hating America, posing as a conservative when you're a Clinton globalist.
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:54:58.020]  Jeffrey, great points.
[02:54:58.020 --> 02:55:00.860]  God bless you.
[02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:03.980]  Sovereign millennial and from Arizona, sovereign millennial.
[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:04.980]  You're on the air.
[02:55:04.980 --> 02:55:05.980]  Go ahead.
[02:55:05.980 --> 02:55:06.980]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:08.980]  Welcome.
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:15.140]  I just wanted to say a couple of things, more of a statement to anybody that is enemy, foreign,
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:16.700]  or domestic.
[02:55:16.700 --> 02:55:21.940]  You will not come against our sovereign rights, George Herbert Walker.
[02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:25.940]  You did not impose or you cannot take our sovereign rights.
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:27.260]  We put Trump in.
[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:29.220]  We, we did.
[02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:30.220]  We elected him.
[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:31.220]  We have the power.
[02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:32.660]  We have the authority.
[02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:34.620]  You will not hold us down.
[02:55:34.620 --> 02:55:35.820]  We're going to rise up.
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:37.260]  We have sovereignty.
[02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:44.180]  The Lord Jesus gives us our sovereign rights and we will protect him, no matter what age,
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:46.660]  color, race, no matter any of that.
[02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:52.860]  And by the way, you're not, you're not just saying that all over the world, nationalists
[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:54.940]  and patriots and capitals are getting elected.
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:55.940]  That's the good news.
[02:55:55.940 --> 02:55:57.340]  We're going to see election fraud.
[02:55:57.340 --> 02:55:59.340]  We're going to see counter-offensives.
[02:55:59.340 --> 02:56:02.940]  But if we can't beat a bunch of meth head antifa, then, you know, we don't have any
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:05.100]  business even being here.
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:06.900]  We have sovereignty, sir.
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:08.820]  That's the number one keyword they hate.
[02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:13.340]  They hate because they think they hold all the power and they hold all the authority
[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:14.460]  where they do not.
[02:56:14.460 --> 02:56:17.900]  We are going to keep winning and they cannot stop us.
[02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:21.220]  Well, if people, if people keep acting, we will thank you, sovereign millennial from
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:22.220]  Arizona.
[02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:23.780]  By the way, here's the article on infowars.com.
[02:56:23.780 --> 02:56:25.780]  Here's the article from naturalnews.com.
[02:56:25.780 --> 02:56:26.780]  It's an excellent article.
[02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:28.220]  It's got all their admissions.
[02:56:28.220 --> 02:56:30.900]  The terraforming is ongoing.
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:32.060]  You say for what aim?
[02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:40.220]  Well, they're collapsing the atmosphere and then telling us that it's our fault, give
[02:56:40.220 --> 02:56:45.300]  them carbon tax, but they want to collapse it to blame us, then use a population reduction
[02:56:45.300 --> 02:56:47.660]  to get control of humanity up front.
[02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:51.180]  So this is their main move and it's admitted.
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:55.460]  And again, if you won't admit Soros is a Nazi, when he said he was on 60 Minutes at
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:57:00.020]  NPR, if you won't admit there's terraforming, geoengineering going on, if you won't admit
[02:57:00.020 --> 02:57:04.140]  world government's happening or that socialism's a nightmare or that nations exist, you're
[02:57:04.140 --> 02:57:05.140]  a globalist.
[02:57:05.140 --> 02:57:09.740]  It's that simple.
[02:57:09.740 --> 02:57:11.540]  And the globalists are race-based.
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:19.220]  They see the demographic of whites being 7% of the world population and they know mainly
[02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:21.940]  whites are Christian and we're for not being racially based.
[02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:25.660]  The globalists use our strength against us, try to turn the third world into a bunch of
[02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:29.980]  race-based idiots, but that's not going to go well as they thought it would because
[02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:32.420]  people want prosperity at the end of the day.
[02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:36.420]  In fact, that's why the world's rejected communism and socialism, so the Marxist have
[02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:38.300]  shifted back to race-based systems.
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:41.420]  Fourth hour with Mike Adams and your phone call straight ahead.
[02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:44.260]  I'll take a few more in a moment, please stay with us.
[02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:49.900]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:54.140]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:57:54.140 --> 02:57:58.300]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[02:57:58.300 --> 02:58:05.420]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:09.620]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:13.780]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:18.780]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:25.980]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:58:25.980 --> 02:58:29.980]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:36.940]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality, so I want you to experience SuperMailVitality
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:38.620]  before it's too late.

[02:58:41.420 --> 02:58:43.140]  SuperMailVitality.com.
[02:58:43.140 --> 02:58:50.460]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can't food during the falls
[02:58:50.460 --> 02:58:55.660]  they have it during the winter and that's what I'm talking about at InfowarsStore.com
[02:58:55.660 --> 02:59:01.860]  When Infowars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriots supply on the top, most respected
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:07.940]  companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[02:59:07.940 --> 02:59:10.540]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:14.820]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[02:59:14.820 --> 02:59:15.820]  win-win.
[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:20.820]  We have those incredible sell prices back, InfowarsStore.com, on Infowars Select storeable
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:21.820]  foods.

[02:59:32.900 --> 02:59:35.460]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:40.340]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:59:40.340 --> 02:59:50.060]  InfowarsStore.com and Infowars Select, high-quality storeable foods powered by my Patriots supply.
[02:59:50.060 --> 03:00:10.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:28.300]  Well, Mike Adams has got really game-changing info coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:32.700]  At least everybody you know to tune in right now, whether it's on AMFM, television, you
[03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:33.700]  name it.
[03:00:33.700 --> 03:00:40.380]  But look at this, government tax takes a record high with France in the top.
[03:00:40.380 --> 03:00:42.620]  That's the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development.
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:45.540]  That's actually the global script that's set up, the Marshall Plan, everything.
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:53.780]  And look at this, IMF's urges U.S. and others to reject dystopian path.
[03:00:53.780 --> 03:00:58.460]  France's protesters are part of a global backlash against climate change taxes.
[03:00:58.460 --> 03:01:03.420]  What it all is, it's global government taxes.
[03:01:03.420 --> 03:01:09.700]  And Macron's the one that's supposed to ram it all through.
[03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:13.540]  It has nothing to do with empowering humanity, everything to do with enslaving humanity.
[03:01:13.540 --> 03:01:17.740]  I'm trying to take as many calls as possible here before Mike Adams comes in here and takes
[03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:22.940]  over.
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:23.940]  Robert and Kansas are on the air.
[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:24.940]  Thanks for holding.
[03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:25.940]  Go ahead.
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:26.940]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:32.540]  It's unbelievable what you said about the millennial generation.
[03:01:32.540 --> 03:01:36.460]  I can't believe that would even come out of your mouth.
[03:01:36.460 --> 03:01:39.060]  Who put us in this position, Alex?
[03:01:39.060 --> 03:01:41.740]  Who's in charge of the education system?
[03:01:41.740 --> 03:01:49.220]  You're going to blame the kids for the conditions that we see now with H.W., was he a millennial?
[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:50.220]  Hold on a minute.
[03:01:50.220 --> 03:01:54.300]  I didn't say it wasn't the globalist and previous generations.
[03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:59.980]  I said that they've gotten 50% of millenniums to support communism and things like that,
[03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:02.300]  which shows the danger of the brainwashing.
[03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:03.780]  I didn't blame them.
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:06.660]  Well, you knocked their wage base out.
[03:02:06.660 --> 03:02:10.980]  You destroyed their chance to even have decent wages, like the parents and grandparents.
[03:02:10.980 --> 03:02:11.980]  I did.
[03:02:11.980 --> 03:02:15.380]  And you blamed them for being most susceptible to some sort of...
[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:16.380]  I did.
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:22.220]  Well, you said that they didn't have the wages that are necessary to upkeep the economy.
[03:02:22.220 --> 03:02:23.220]  That's true, Alex.
[03:02:23.220 --> 03:02:24.220]  Do you think that's there?
[03:02:24.220 --> 03:02:30.140]  Well, sir, I'm fighting NAFTA and I'm fighting GATT and I'm fighting all these things.
[03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:32.300]  So I'm trying to get the jobs restored.
[03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:37.580]  So I'm not going lying in state right now like George Walker Bush, and I did not say
[03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:40.620]  millennials run things or wreck the country.
[03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:43.260]  So that's a classic strongman argument.
[03:02:43.260 --> 03:02:48.260]  They're probably some of the most awake, most intelligent and dynamic generation that
[03:02:48.260 --> 03:02:49.260]  there is.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:51.300]  Well, I mean, I said that there are a lot of them that are awake.
[03:02:51.300 --> 03:02:55.660]  I said, but the leftist areas are the very, very worst.
[03:02:55.660 --> 03:03:00.100]  Well, they're brainwashed, Alex, but that's not them.
[03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:01.100]  They're victims, okay?
[03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:05.060]  And you blaming the victim, I just haven't heard you do that, and I didn't like it.
[03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:09.700]  I appreciate your call, and I don't think they're victims.
[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:12.860]  If you go to the colleges right now, it is millennials.
[03:03:12.860 --> 03:03:18.300]  I said that group of millennials where they've had their brainwashing going, the globalists,
[03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:22.980]  I said the old professors, that they've really created a bunch of authoritarians.
[03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:23.980]  So that's a mischaracterization.
[03:03:23.980 --> 03:03:27.820]  So I'm not going to debate a mischaracterization with you.
[03:03:27.820 --> 03:03:33.060]  Now we've got 20 phone lines, and I have this new rule where we only take 10, but my rules
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:34.060]  are not followed.
[03:03:34.060 --> 03:03:36.180]  So we took, like, 20, 30 phone calls.
[03:03:36.180 --> 03:03:38.220]  That's about 10 a year on hold when we end this show.
[03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:40.540]  So sorry I can't go to you.
[03:03:40.540 --> 03:03:44.500]  But I don't have any guilt anymore because I said, under the new system, we're putting
[03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:47.320]  the systems in here to organize things to go to the next level.
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:51.900]  We take 10 phone calls at a time, and then we open the phones up again and take the calls.
[03:03:51.900 --> 03:03:54.820]  But that didn't happen, so I'm out of here.
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:56.100]  I'll be listening to Mike Adams.
[03:03:56.100 --> 03:04:00.420]  He's loaded for bear, coming up to cover a whole host of issues, a very serious time.
[03:04:00.420 --> 03:04:04.260]  That'll be a lot of huge things happening.
[03:04:04.260 --> 03:04:07.420]  And so we're going to be getting into all of it on the other side.
[03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:11.380]  These articles are absolutely critical.
[03:04:11.380 --> 03:04:12.660]  We can't tweet this out.
[03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:14.260]  You're going to have to tweet it out.
[03:04:14.260 --> 03:04:16.660]  It's on newswars.com.
[03:04:16.660 --> 03:04:17.660]  It's on infowars.com.
[03:04:17.660 --> 03:04:20.140]  About an hour ago, I said to put it back on the front page.
[03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:24.140]  I'm going to go in there in the break and find out how that's happened.
[03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:31.620]  This terraforming has begun global dimming plot to exterminate humanity revealed.
[03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:33.340]  And so it's at naturalnews.com.
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:34.980]  You want to hear this.
[03:04:34.980 --> 03:04:37.660]  This is the truth about the condensation trails.
[03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:39.220]  This is the truth about the geoengineering.
[03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:54.260]  This is the truth about all of it.
[03:04:54.260 --> 03:04:59.140]  In the last few months, info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[03:04:59.140 --> 03:05:00.700]  of many of our bestselling items.
[03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:03.980]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale free shipping
[03:05:03.980 --> 03:05:07.260]  store wide 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[03:05:07.260 --> 03:05:13.460]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:17.500]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine four to five super blue, you'll
[03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:22.220]  get a free gift of a bestselling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:05:22.220 --> 03:05:25.420]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[03:05:25.420 --> 03:05:26.420]  out.
[03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:30.380]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:31.380]  sells out.
[03:05:31.380 --> 03:05:33.700]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:39.020]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:40.540]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:05:40.540 --> 03:05:42.180]  We are losing money on this.
[03:05:42.180 --> 03:05:43.620]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:44.620]  Get your free gift.
[03:05:44.620 --> 03:05:45.620]  You're free shipping everything.
[03:05:45.620 --> 03:05:50.180]  And don't fight the crowds in four store.com, in four's life.com, or triple eight, two,
[03:05:50.180 --> 03:05:51.980]  five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:05:51.980 --> 03:06:01.140]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:06:01.140 --> 03:06:16.180]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[03:06:16.180 --> 03:06:17.180]  in the UK.
[03:06:17.180 --> 03:06:21.780]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[03:06:21.780 --> 03:06:26.620]  What is the secret of silent freedom?
[03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:32.020]  The powdered flesh from dead babies, some people believe they can cure disease.
[03:06:32.020 --> 03:06:36.500]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soil and Green is in short supply.
[03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:39.660]  Remember, Tuesday is Soil and Green Day.
[03:06:39.660 --> 03:06:42.660]  The supply of Soil and Green has been exhausted.
[03:06:42.660 --> 03:06:44.660]  You must evacuate the area.
[03:06:44.660 --> 03:06:45.660]  Today is Tuesday.
[03:06:45.660 --> 03:06:46.660]  Is that the rule?
[03:06:46.660 --> 03:06:54.100]  The rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group Company, are not allowed
[03:06:54.100 --> 03:07:00.060]  to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[03:07:00.060 --> 03:07:02.060]  So enjoy the flavor.
[03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:05.260]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels
[03:07:05.260 --> 03:07:06.500]  and sales taxes.
[03:07:06.500 --> 03:07:08.500]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[03:07:08.500 --> 03:07:10.380]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:11.700]  I'm for regular suicide.
[03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:13.700]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[03:07:13.700 --> 03:07:18.060]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:25.100]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that creative and medical cost?
[03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:29.420]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[03:07:29.420 --> 03:07:43.900]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[03:07:43.900 --> 03:07:46.580]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:51.420]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:54.020]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[03:07:54.020 --> 03:07:58.980]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison
[03:07:58.980 --> 03:08:03.380]  guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[03:08:03.380 --> 03:08:06.380]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[03:08:06.380 --> 03:08:08.660]  The scoops are on their way.
[03:08:08.660 --> 03:08:11.180]  The scoops are on their way.
[03:08:11.180 --> 03:08:14.380]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[03:08:14.380 --> 03:08:24.740]  You will find out why silent green means life, you will find out why silent green means death.
[03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:27.780]  We gotta stop them!
[03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:30.780]  Come on!
[03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:33.900]  Silent Green is people!
[03:08:33.900 --> 03:08:38.580]  I'm a political assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[03:08:38.580 --> 03:08:42.260]  Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:08:42.260 --> 03:08:47.100]  We wake up in the morning and the light is virtual here.
[03:08:47.100 --> 03:08:49.220]  All right, welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:51.760]  This is Mike Adams, guest hosting this hour.
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:53.460]  Great to join you today.
[03:08:53.460 --> 03:08:55.260]  Unfortunately, I don't have the best news
[03:08:55.260 --> 03:08:56.220]  to share with you.
[03:08:56.220 --> 03:08:59.220]  A lot of realizations that are now coming to the surface.
[03:08:59.220 --> 03:09:02.540]  I'm going to be covering that in this broadcast today,
[03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:06.460]  the terraforming of our planet.
[03:09:06.460 --> 03:09:11.220]  And at first, this concept sounds outlandish.
[03:09:11.220 --> 03:09:14.740]  But then you dig into the climate change alarmists
[03:09:14.740 --> 03:09:18.060]  and what they are actually doing and what they are proposing
[03:09:18.060 --> 03:09:21.220]  to do to escalate their activities even more.
[03:09:21.220 --> 03:09:23.180]  And if you dig into the science, and that's
[03:09:23.180 --> 03:09:26.980]  what I do every day, we monitor over 1,300 science
[03:09:26.980 --> 03:09:28.700]  and medical journals.
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:30.220]  And we cover the science every day.
[03:09:30.220 --> 03:09:31.380]  I'm a lab scientist.
[03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:33.860]  I'm a published scientist and a science author.
[03:09:33.860 --> 03:09:36.860]  And when I look at the science of what they want to do
[03:09:36.860 --> 03:09:40.140]  in the name of halting global warming or climate change,
[03:09:40.140 --> 03:09:44.820]  it turns out that this plan would exterminate humanity.
[03:09:44.820 --> 03:09:47.740]  I'm going to get into that sum here today,
[03:09:47.740 --> 03:09:50.660]  but also to let you know that the full episode of Counter
[03:09:50.660 --> 03:09:54.660]  Think, which airs on infowars.com Sunday at 6 PM.
[03:09:54.660 --> 03:09:57.380]  That full episode, I've already recorded that episode.
[03:09:57.380 --> 03:09:59.380]  It's in production right now.
[03:09:59.380 --> 03:10:01.380]  And it has even more details than what
[03:10:01.380 --> 03:10:03.140]  I'll be able to present here today,
[03:10:03.140 --> 03:10:04.700]  because I've got some other points to cover.
[03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:07.860]  But the big, big story is they are now
[03:10:07.860 --> 03:10:12.220]  conducting and advocating what's called stratospheric aerosol
[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:15.060]  injection, SAI.
[03:10:15.060 --> 03:10:16.860]  And there's a science paper on that that's
[03:10:16.860 --> 03:10:20.500]  in what is it, the Environmental Research Letters.
[03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:22.460]  And I've cited that science journal.
[03:10:22.460 --> 03:10:26.580]  And this is basically the new science-y sounding term
[03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:31.140]  for what most people would call chemtrails or geoengineering.
[03:10:31.140 --> 03:10:33.460]  And in this science paper, they proposed
[03:10:33.460 --> 03:10:36.300]  spraying at very high altitudes, for example,
[03:10:36.300 --> 03:10:40.500]  20 kilometers of altitude, sulfur dioxide
[03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:43.980]  into the upper atmosphere in order to dim the sun.
[03:10:43.980 --> 03:10:47.420]  They want to partially block out the sun.
[03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:52.020]  And they propose building an entire new fleet of aircraft
[03:10:52.020 --> 03:10:55.540]  with specialization just to spray this pollution
[03:10:55.540 --> 03:10:56.540]  all around the world.
[03:10:56.540 --> 03:11:00.020]  Now, you and I would call sulfur dioxide smog,
[03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:02.580]  or technically you would say it results
[03:11:02.580 --> 03:11:04.460]  in the creation of smog.
[03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:06.580]  And even the EPA says that sulfur dioxide
[03:11:06.580 --> 03:11:11.020]  is a toxin to humans and makes it difficult to breathe.
[03:11:11.020 --> 03:11:12.620]  If you have enough sulfur dioxide in the air,
[03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:14.900]  you will asphyxiate and die.
[03:11:14.900 --> 03:11:17.780]  In fact, all mammals will, because sulfur dioxide
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:20.300]  is a poison to humans.
[03:11:20.300 --> 03:11:22.980]  So why are they altering the atmosphere?
[03:11:22.980 --> 03:11:24.460]  Why are they wanting to spray this
[03:11:24.460 --> 03:11:28.740]  by running 4,000 flights a year with a proposed cost
[03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:32.420]  of two and a quarter billion dollars a year
[03:11:32.420 --> 03:11:35.740]  in order to spray this pollution into the upper atmosphere?
[03:11:35.740 --> 03:11:39.940]  The answer is terraforming operations are underway.
[03:11:39.940 --> 03:11:42.580]  They are terraforming planet Earth.
[03:11:42.580 --> 03:11:44.620]  They're altering the atmosphere.
[03:11:44.620 --> 03:11:49.220]  And if you look at the implications of this sun dimming,
[03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:52.380]  this global dimming that they want to create,
[03:11:52.380 --> 03:11:54.300]  the implications are catastrophic
[03:11:54.300 --> 03:11:56.860]  for the survival of the human race.
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:11:58.340]  And I'm going to cover those implications here
[03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:00.220]  in this show today in upcoming segments.
[03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:03.540]  But one of them that you need to know right up front
[03:12:03.540 --> 03:12:07.140]  is the depletion of oxygen from the atmosphere.
[03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:09.140]  Currently, oxygen levels, you could say,
[03:12:09.140 --> 03:12:13.780]  are roughly at about 20% at sea level.
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:17.740]  Those oxygen levels will plummet because global dimming
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:21.140]  will harm the photosynthesis metabolism,
[03:12:21.140 --> 03:12:24.180]  you could say, of plants that produce oxygen as a byproduct
[03:12:24.180 --> 03:12:25.780]  of photosynthesis.
[03:12:25.780 --> 03:12:30.060]  This oxygen depletion will, if allowed to continue,
[03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:32.420]  it will asphyxiate humans.
[03:12:32.420 --> 03:12:35.580]  It will create Earth as a habitat
[03:12:35.580 --> 03:12:39.060]  that is not survivable by human beings.
[03:12:39.060 --> 03:12:40.700]  They are altering the atmosphere.
[03:12:40.700 --> 03:12:42.580]  They're altering our planet.
[03:12:42.580 --> 03:12:44.900]  They are terraforming planet Earth.
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:46.580]  And you might ask, why?
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:48.220]  Gosh, what's the reason behind this?
[03:12:48.220 --> 03:12:49.380]  Maybe we'll get to some of that.
[03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:50.660]  But the important thing to realize
[03:12:50.660 --> 03:12:54.780]  is that as we fight against globalists today,
[03:12:54.780 --> 03:12:58.100]  globalists want humanity to surrender to their tyranny
[03:12:58.100 --> 03:13:00.820]  on a political level, on an economic level.
[03:13:00.820 --> 03:13:04.020]  Globalists want to control all thought, all speech,
[03:13:04.020 --> 03:13:08.580]  all news and information, all science, medicine, history,
[03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:10.460]  and even the very definition of truth.
[03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:12.900]  And many of you, and myself included,
[03:13:12.900 --> 03:13:15.620]  we've been operating on the understanding
[03:13:15.620 --> 03:13:17.940]  that globalists just want to enslave humanity
[03:13:17.940 --> 03:13:19.860]  under their control.
[03:13:19.860 --> 03:13:22.380]  What if that's not the big picture here?
[03:13:22.380 --> 03:13:25.260]  What if that's only step one to the bigger picture,
[03:13:25.260 --> 03:13:27.420]  which is that globalists are actually,
[03:13:27.420 --> 03:13:29.620]  perhaps unknowingly on their part,
[03:13:29.620 --> 03:13:31.700]  and perhaps with knowledge,
[03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:35.660]  they're actually working to exterminate the human race
[03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:39.380]  and to prepare the planet for a post-human era.
[03:13:39.380 --> 03:13:41.460]  What if that's actually the bigger picture?
[03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:43.180]  Once you come to understand that,
[03:13:44.420 --> 03:13:46.260]  everything else starts to make sense.
[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:47.540]  Why are the abortion centers?
[03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:49.020]  Why the promotion of abortion,
[03:13:49.020 --> 03:13:51.940]  the killing of human babies?
[03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:54.780]  Why the mass poisoning of the food supply?
[03:13:54.780 --> 03:13:57.620]  With glyphosate and cancer-causing chemicals.
[03:13:57.620 --> 03:14:01.460]  Why the mass poisoning of Africans in Kenya
[03:14:01.460 --> 03:14:03.700]  with hidden infertility chemicals
[03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:06.300]  that are put into the UN-approved
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:08.740]  World Health Organization-approved vaccines?
[03:14:08.740 --> 03:14:12.380]  That the Catholic bishops in Kenya actually exposed
[03:14:12.380 --> 03:14:14.820]  they sent those vaccines to a lab and found out,
[03:14:14.820 --> 03:14:16.740]  oh my gosh, that there are infertility chemicals in here
[03:14:16.740 --> 03:14:18.020]  and all these African women
[03:14:18.020 --> 03:14:20.660]  are having spontaneous abortions.
[03:14:20.660 --> 03:14:24.100]  Why the drive to depopulate the planet?
[03:14:24.100 --> 03:14:26.540]  Why are globalists so fixated
[03:14:26.540 --> 03:14:29.460]  on eliminating 90% of the human population?
[03:14:29.460 --> 03:14:30.580]  And more importantly,
[03:14:30.580 --> 03:14:32.540]  what might they be willing to do
[03:14:32.540 --> 03:14:36.060]  to accomplish that goal of extermination?
[03:14:36.060 --> 03:14:38.660]  You see, I believe that we're not just fighting
[03:14:38.660 --> 03:14:40.900]  for liberty here, we're not just fighting,
[03:14:40.900 --> 03:14:43.100]  it's not Republicans versus Democrats.
[03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:45.820]  It's not even populists versus globalists,
[03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:47.300]  although that's part of it,
[03:14:47.300 --> 03:14:48.780]  but there's a much bigger picture.
[03:14:48.780 --> 03:14:50.700]  There's an outer layer to this,
[03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:53.700]  which is that many people,
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:55.620]  especially globalists and insiders,
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:14:57.420]  and some of them are upfront about this,
[03:14:57.420 --> 03:15:01.940]  are quite literally working to exterminate the human race.
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:04.700]  And they're doing it by claiming
[03:15:04.700 --> 03:15:07.380]  to be taking actions that will save the planet.
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:10.380]  So they say that to save the planet,
[03:15:10.380 --> 03:15:12.500]  you have to surrender to them.
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:14.980]  And you have to spray the atmosphere with poison.
[03:15:14.980 --> 03:15:17.900]  You have to pollute the planet to save the planet.
[03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:20.100]  Well, that makes no sense, does it?
[03:15:20.100 --> 03:15:21.340]  But when they say climate change,
[03:15:21.340 --> 03:15:23.820]  it's because they want to change the climate.
[03:15:23.820 --> 03:15:25.980]  Understand that, when they say climate change,
[03:15:25.980 --> 03:15:27.540]  it's because they want to change the climate.
[03:15:27.540 --> 03:15:29.100]  They want to change the atmosphere.
[03:15:29.100 --> 03:15:31.420]  They want to chemically alter the atmosphere.
[03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:33.300]  They want to reduce sunlight exposure
[03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:34.580]  of the plants on earth,
[03:15:34.580 --> 03:15:36.340]  and they want to collapse the food supply
[03:15:36.340 --> 03:15:37.500]  and exterminate human beings.
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:40.260]  So we are fighting for much more
[03:15:40.260 --> 03:15:42.860]  than just geopolitical liberty.
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:45.900]  We're fighting for the future of the human race.
[03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:48.060]  I'll cover that in more detail as we continue here
[03:15:48.060 --> 03:15:50.660]  on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:15:50.660 --> 03:15:53.900]  I'm Mike Adams, we'll be right back after this break.
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:55.100]  Hear that?
[03:15:55.100 --> 03:15:57.220]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[03:15:57.220 --> 03:16:00.500]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:03.300]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.300 --> 03:16:06.940]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.940 --> 03:16:09.580]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device
[03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:12.780]  that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,
[03:16:12.780 --> 03:16:14.460]  even when you're miles away.
[03:16:14.460 --> 03:16:16.060]  Security is a mindset,
[03:16:16.060 --> 03:16:19.140]  and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[03:16:19.140 --> 03:16:21.580]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[03:16:23.540 --> 03:16:25.940]  The United States of Empire is a book
[03:16:25.940 --> 03:16:29.860]  that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.860 --> 03:16:32.900]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:36.540]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I
[03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:38.740]  and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.740 --> 03:16:42.580]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:43.860]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.860 --> 03:16:45.180]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:45.180 --> 03:16:48.100]  The Deep State began with World War I,
[03:16:48.100 --> 03:16:51.340]  the United States of Empire, by James Dunn,
[03:16:51.340 --> 03:16:53.580]  available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.580 --> 03:16:55.420]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders

[03:19:50.460 --> 03:20:00.460]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.460 --> 03:20:14.460]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:20.460]  And we're back continuing here on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.460 --> 03:20:22.460]  Thank you for joining me today.
[03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:26.460]  Mike Adams here, guest hosting for the rest of this fourth hour.
[03:20:26.460 --> 03:20:28.460]  There's so much going on today.
[03:20:28.460 --> 03:20:31.460]  I've got a couple of programming notes to share with you,
[03:20:31.460 --> 03:20:34.460]  but we are going to continue to share the truth
[03:20:34.460 --> 03:20:37.460]  about this terraforming operation that is underway
[03:20:37.460 --> 03:20:39.460]  to alter Earth's atmosphere,
[03:20:39.460 --> 03:20:41.460]  to collapse the global food supply,
[03:20:41.460 --> 03:20:44.460]  deplete oxygen, and exterminate the human race.
[03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:47.460]  And that is not hyperbole. That is the actual plan.
[03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:50.460]  They call it a climate change plan,
[03:20:50.460 --> 03:20:52.460]  because their plan is to change the climate.
[03:20:52.460 --> 03:20:54.460]  So I will get into a lot more details on that today.
[03:20:54.460 --> 03:20:57.460]  But several programming notes, they're very important.
[03:20:57.460 --> 03:21:00.460]  Number one, of course, this entire subject is covered
[03:21:00.460 --> 03:21:03.460]  in more detail in the counterthink episode that airs Sunday
[03:21:03.460 --> 03:21:06.460]  at 6 p.m. at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:06.460 --> 03:21:08.460]  If you missed that, you can catch that video
[03:21:08.460 --> 03:21:11.460]  a couple of days later at counterthink.com.
[03:21:11.460 --> 03:21:14.460]  Also, the video website, Brighton.com,
[03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:16.460]  which hosts thousands of InfoWars videos,
[03:21:16.460 --> 03:21:19.460]  as well as my entire channel and thousands of other channels.
[03:21:19.460 --> 03:21:23.460]  That video site will host that video a couple of days later.
[03:21:23.460 --> 03:21:27.460]  We now have RSS feeds for every channel at Brighton.com,
[03:21:27.460 --> 03:21:30.460]  which means you can have an RSS reader,
[03:21:30.460 --> 03:21:32.460]  an app on your mobile device, your desktop device.
[03:21:32.460 --> 03:21:35.460]  You can, in essence, subscribe to the InfoWars channel
[03:21:35.460 --> 03:21:38.460]  or the David Knight channel, and you can then be alerted
[03:21:38.460 --> 03:21:41.460]  on your app without having to, you know,
[03:21:41.460 --> 03:21:44.460]  subscribe with an email address or something like that.
[03:21:44.460 --> 03:21:47.460]  So the RSS feed, just go to the top of any channel page.
[03:21:47.460 --> 03:21:48.460]  You'll see the RSS feed.
[03:21:48.460 --> 03:21:51.460]  You can get all the new videos that way.
[03:21:51.460 --> 03:21:54.460]  Now, today, by the way, I've also put out a podcast
[03:21:54.460 --> 03:21:56.460]  that sort of gives you the highlights
[03:21:56.460 --> 03:21:58.460]  of this terraforming operation.
[03:21:58.460 --> 03:22:01.460]  That podcast is available now at Brighton.com.
[03:22:01.460 --> 03:22:04.460]  You can just go there and search for the term terraforming,
[03:22:04.460 --> 03:22:05.460]  or you can go to naturalnews.com.
[03:22:05.460 --> 03:22:08.460]  It's the number one story on there right now.
[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:12.460]  And in addition, when you put together the dots
[03:22:12.460 --> 03:22:14.460]  of how humanity is being exterminated,
[03:22:14.460 --> 03:22:16.460]  because that's what we're dealing with now.
[03:22:16.460 --> 03:22:20.460]  And I've kind of walked into this conclusion cautiously
[03:22:20.460 --> 03:22:24.460]  over time, but now it's so evident.
[03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:25.460]  It's so obvious.
[03:22:25.460 --> 03:22:27.460]  The extermination of the human race is on.
[03:22:27.460 --> 03:22:28.460]  It has begun.
[03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:30.460]  It's playing out every single day,
[03:22:30.460 --> 03:22:32.460]  and the evidence is irrefutable.
[03:22:32.460 --> 03:22:36.460]  And part of that extermination is through the EPA.
[03:22:36.460 --> 03:22:40.460]  The EPA is the Environmental Pollution Agency.
[03:22:40.460 --> 03:22:43.460]  And I have a whistleblower from the EPA
[03:22:43.460 --> 03:22:47.460]  who has gone on camera and filmed an extraordinary interview.
[03:22:47.460 --> 03:22:49.460]  And his name is Dr. David Lewis.
[03:22:49.460 --> 03:22:52.460]  He's a former top-level scientist with the EPA.
[03:22:52.460 --> 03:22:54.460]  And David Lewis is on camera.
[03:22:54.460 --> 03:22:57.460]  I'm going to release this video in the next few days.
[03:22:57.460 --> 03:23:00.460]  Maybe I'll be back on Infowars to talk about this next week.
[03:23:00.460 --> 03:23:04.460]  He says on camera that the EPA, and I'm paraphrasing,
[03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:06.460]  his exact words are close to this,
[03:23:06.460 --> 03:23:09.460]  but he says the EPA is enabling bioterrorism
[03:23:09.460 --> 03:23:13.460]  through the mass pollution of our soils through biosludge
[03:23:13.460 --> 03:23:16.460]  and that the EPA is committing crimes against our world,
[03:23:16.460 --> 03:23:18.460]  crimes against the environment,
[03:23:18.460 --> 03:23:21.460]  and that the EPA will, when historians look back at the EPA,
[03:23:21.460 --> 03:23:25.460]  it will be seen as betraying humankind,
[03:23:25.460 --> 03:23:29.460]  polluting our world, causing cancer, infertility,
[03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:33.460]  outbreaks, superbugs, viral, almost bioweapons.
[03:23:33.460 --> 03:23:35.460]  The EPA is doing that.
[03:23:35.460 --> 03:23:38.460]  And if you look at that issue by itself,
[03:23:38.460 --> 03:23:40.460]  you wonder, why is the EPA doing this?
[03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:42.460]  It doesn't make any sense.
[03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:44.460]  They're supposed to be stopping pollution.
[03:23:44.460 --> 03:23:45.460]  What's going on?
[03:23:45.460 --> 03:23:48.460]  And by the way, you won't be surprised by this.
[03:23:48.460 --> 03:23:52.460]  All of this, the regulatory framework to allow this
[03:23:52.460 --> 03:23:56.460]  was approved by Bill Clinton back in the 1990s.
[03:23:56.460 --> 03:23:58.460]  This is a Bill Clinton EPA operation.
[03:23:58.460 --> 03:24:02.460]  That's when the EPA became the Environmental Pollution Agency.
[03:24:02.460 --> 03:24:04.460]  And then it continued under Bush and Obama
[03:24:04.460 --> 03:24:06.460]  and even today under Trump.
[03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:09.460]  It continues to be a scourge on humanity.
[03:24:09.460 --> 03:24:12.460]  But this interview with Dr. David Lewis
[03:24:12.460 --> 03:24:14.460]  is coming out over the next few days.
[03:24:14.460 --> 03:24:15.460]  And it's bombshell.
[03:24:15.460 --> 03:24:18.460]  And we're releasing the transcript as well as the interview.
[03:24:18.460 --> 03:24:21.460]  So this is another can't miss video that you'll see
[03:24:21.460 --> 03:24:24.460]  at brighttion.com, probably infowars.com
[03:24:24.460 --> 03:24:26.460]  will post an article and a video about it,
[03:24:26.460 --> 03:24:28.460]  I'm guessing because it's so bombshell.
[03:24:28.460 --> 03:24:32.460]  But the big picture here is, why is the EPA doing this?
[03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:33.460]  Connect the dots now.
[03:24:33.460 --> 03:24:35.460]  Now that you understand terraforming is underway,
[03:24:35.460 --> 03:24:38.460]  there is a deliberate goal to poison the planet
[03:24:38.460 --> 03:24:44.460]  and make it inhospitable, let's say, to humans.
[03:24:44.460 --> 03:24:46.460]  So that humans cannot survive on the planet.
[03:24:46.460 --> 03:24:47.460]  How would you do that?
[03:24:47.460 --> 03:24:49.460]  Well, you would poison the planet.
[03:24:49.460 --> 03:24:51.460]  You would pollute the planet.
[03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:53.460]  And how would you accomplish that?
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:54.460]  Well, let's see.
[03:24:54.460 --> 03:24:56.460]  You would spray poison into the atmosphere.
[03:24:56.460 --> 03:24:58.460]  That's what they're doing now with their stratospheric aerosol
[03:24:58.460 --> 03:25:00.460]  injections, geoengineering.
[03:25:00.460 --> 03:25:01.460]  You would take smog.
[03:25:01.460 --> 03:25:03.460]  You would take poison, sulfur dioxide.
[03:25:03.460 --> 03:25:04.460]  You'd spray it into the air.
[03:25:04.460 --> 03:25:06.460]  But you'd also poison the soils.
[03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:09.460]  You would poison the farmlands, the croplands.
[03:25:09.460 --> 03:25:10.460]  You would poison the forests.
[03:25:10.460 --> 03:25:13.460]  You would poison the rivers and the oceans.
[03:25:13.460 --> 03:25:16.460]  And you'd need a government agency to pull that off, wouldn't you?
[03:25:16.460 --> 03:25:19.460]  Because the people wouldn't just naturally want to poison
[03:25:19.460 --> 03:25:20.460]  their own world.
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:21.460]  That would be suicide, right?
[03:25:21.460 --> 03:25:24.460]  That would cause cancer, that would cause infertility.
[03:25:24.460 --> 03:25:29.460]  So you'd need a government agency to push it and call it recycling.
[03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:33.460]  They'd poison the atmosphere, and they'd call it saving the planet
[03:25:33.460 --> 03:25:34.460]  from climate change.
[03:25:34.460 --> 03:25:37.460]  They'd poison the soils, and they'd call it recycling
[03:25:37.460 --> 03:25:40.460]  and nutrient-rich fertilizer.
[03:25:40.460 --> 03:25:42.460]  They'd poison the water.
[03:25:42.460 --> 03:25:43.460]  They'd poison the air.
[03:25:43.460 --> 03:25:44.460]  They'd poison the soil.
[03:25:44.460 --> 03:25:45.460]  They'd poison the crops.
[03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:49.460]  And right now, today, I've got an interview on naturalnews.com
[03:25:49.460 --> 03:25:52.460]  from a citizen activist named Craig Monk.
[03:25:52.460 --> 03:25:56.460]  And he has gone public with the truth about how
[03:25:56.460 --> 03:25:59.460]  biosludge being spread on farm crops, now,
[03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:04.460]  they have to send in men in hazmat suits to pick up,
[03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:07.460]  and I'm not kidding, and I apologize if this sounds too graphic,
[03:26:07.460 --> 03:26:10.460]  they have to pick up the used feminine hygiene products
[03:26:10.460 --> 03:26:14.460]  that are spread on the farmlands because they're in the biosludge.
[03:26:14.460 --> 03:26:16.460]  Biosludge is human sewage.
[03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:18.460]  It's everything that's flushed down the toilet.
[03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:21.460]  And so cities, including the city of Austin, Texas,
[03:26:21.460 --> 03:26:24.460]  they spread this biosludge on the food,
[03:26:24.460 --> 03:26:27.460]  on the crops, on the farmland,
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:30.460]  and it contains everything that's flushed down the toilet.
[03:26:30.460 --> 03:26:34.460]  It is a biohazard, and they have to send hazmat teams there
[03:26:34.460 --> 03:26:37.460]  to go pick that up, to actually get the...
[03:26:37.460 --> 03:26:39.460]  Again, I'm sorry about the graphic nature of this,
[03:26:39.460 --> 03:26:41.460]  to get the used feminine hygiene products
[03:26:41.460 --> 03:26:43.460]  to take them off the corn crops.
[03:26:43.460 --> 03:26:47.460]  And then that corn becomes your breakfast cereal, by the way.
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:49.460]  That's happening right now.
[03:26:49.460 --> 03:26:51.460]  And we've got all the whistleblowers. We've got the film.
[03:26:51.460 --> 03:26:53.460]  It's called Biosludged, and it's out there right now.
[03:26:53.460 --> 03:26:54.460]  You can watch it for free.
[03:26:54.460 --> 03:26:57.460]  In fact, you can download it for free, and you can share the files.
[03:26:57.460 --> 03:27:01.460]  And that's at biosludged.com, if you want to go get those files.
[03:27:01.460 --> 03:27:03.460]  This is happening right now.
[03:27:03.460 --> 03:27:05.460]  That's why I'm sharing all these programming notes,
[03:27:05.460 --> 03:27:07.460]  because there are so many whistleblowers and so many interviews coming out,
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:12.460]  including, again, EPA scientist, whistleblower, Dr. David Lewis.
[03:27:12.460 --> 03:27:14.460]  And his book is called Science for Sale,
[03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:18.460]  and he talks about how the EPA has sold out the world
[03:27:18.460 --> 03:27:20.460]  by fabricating science.
[03:27:20.460 --> 03:27:24.460]  And he says that the only science that's allowed in the EPA today
[03:27:24.460 --> 03:27:26.460]  is fake science.
[03:27:26.460 --> 03:27:30.460]  That there's no real science allowed out anymore inside the EPA.
[03:27:30.460 --> 03:27:33.460]  Every study is faked.
[03:27:33.460 --> 03:27:35.460]  Every data set is faked.
[03:27:35.460 --> 03:27:39.460]  And the purpose of the EPA is to pollute our world.
[03:27:39.460 --> 03:27:41.460]  And it makes sense now, when you understand
[03:27:41.460 --> 03:27:45.460]  the terraforming poisoning operation that's taking place.
[03:27:45.460 --> 03:27:47.460]  And so the globalists, their plan,
[03:27:47.460 --> 03:27:50.460]  it's not just to enslave you politically and economically.
[03:27:50.460 --> 03:27:53.460]  The globalists have a plan to destroy you.
[03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:57.460]  Not just to destroy your speech and silence you off YouTube and Facebook,
[03:27:57.460 --> 03:27:59.460]  not just to demonetize and deplatform you.
[03:27:59.460 --> 03:28:01.460]  That's just their warm-up.
[03:28:01.460 --> 03:28:04.460]  You know, they take in for wars offline.
[03:28:04.460 --> 03:28:06.460]  That's not even a warning shot.
[03:28:06.460 --> 03:28:07.460]  That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:28:07.460 --> 03:28:10.460]  What they really want to do is poison your family.
[03:28:10.460 --> 03:28:12.460]  They're poison Alex Jones' family.
[03:28:12.460 --> 03:28:16.460]  They want to murder every human being on the planet
[03:28:16.460 --> 03:28:18.460]  and they figured out how to do it.
[03:28:18.460 --> 03:28:21.460]  They convinced the millennials and the liberals
[03:28:21.460 --> 03:28:24.460]  that poisoning the planet is saving the planet.
[03:28:24.460 --> 03:28:26.460]  And then everybody goes along with it and says,
[03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:30.460]  yeah, let's save our planet as they're committing mass suicide.
[03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:33.460]  Because liberalism and globalism is a suicide cult.
[03:28:33.460 --> 03:28:36.460]  And many humans are trapped in that suicide cult
[03:28:36.460 --> 03:28:39.460]  and our job is to free you from that cult with good information.

[03:31:11.460 --> 03:31:16.460]  would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists
[03:31:16.460 --> 03:31:19.460]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[03:31:19.460 --> 03:31:44.460]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[03:31:49.460 --> 03:31:52.460]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it,
[03:31:52.460 --> 03:31:54.460]  we are unstoppable.
[03:31:54.460 --> 03:31:57.460]  In the last few months, Infowars has been escalating our sales
[03:31:57.460 --> 03:32:00.460]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:32:00.460 --> 03:32:02.460]  And then I came up with the idea last week,
[03:32:02.460 --> 03:32:04.460]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide,
[03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:07.460]  50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:13.460]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:32:13.460 --> 03:32:17.460]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, fortified super blue,
[03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:22.460]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:32:22.460 --> 03:32:24.460]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt,
[03:32:24.460 --> 03:32:26.460]  but these are going to be selling out.
[03:32:26.460 --> 03:32:30.460]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there
[03:32:30.460 --> 03:32:33.460]  until it sells out and then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:32:33.460 --> 03:32:38.460]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:32:38.460 --> 03:32:40.460]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:32:40.460 --> 03:32:42.460]  We are losing money on this.
[03:32:42.460 --> 03:32:43.460]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:32:43.460 --> 03:32:45.460]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:32:45.460 --> 03:32:51.460]  And don't fight the crowds in FullWorksStore.com, in FullWorksLife.com, or triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:32:51.460 --> 03:33:20.460]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:33:20.460 --> 03:33:28.460]  For years, anyone who dared mention the word chemtrails was mocked as a lunatic or a conspiracy theorist.
[03:33:28.460 --> 03:33:34.460]  And now the synonymous term geoengineering is found throughout the scientific literature.
[03:33:34.460 --> 03:33:41.460]  You see it advocated by scientists now on a daily basis as a solution to climate change and global warming.
[03:33:41.460 --> 03:33:48.460]  And they are openly advocating the spraying of the atmosphere with pollutants in order to dim the sun.
[03:33:48.460 --> 03:33:50.460]  They say save the planet.
[03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:58.460]  It's called stratospheric aerosol injection, and there are now published scientific studies that propose thousands of flights a year
[03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:03.460]  and releasing millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.
[03:34:03.460 --> 03:34:10.460]  In this segment here on the Alice Jones show, we're going to cover the science of what this causes, what happens.
[03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:14.460]  Let's talk about cause and effect from a scientific point of view.
[03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:19.460]  This is when you release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere at any altitude.
[03:34:19.460 --> 03:34:22.460]  It doesn't have to be the stratosphere, it could be lower altitudes.
[03:34:22.460 --> 03:34:23.460]  What happens?
[03:34:23.460 --> 03:34:29.460]  Because you need to understand the effects of this and how this is a threat to humanity.
[03:34:29.460 --> 03:34:35.460]  And I cover this in more detail in the full episode that's airing this Sunday, but I'll give you some highlights here.
[03:34:35.460 --> 03:34:42.460]  Number one, every person should have learned this in high school that photosynthesis is required for plants to live.
[03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:45.460]  It's part of their metabolism and essentially respiration.
[03:34:45.460 --> 03:34:46.460]  It's basic botany.
[03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:56.460]  So photosynthesis plants take in sunlight, carbon dioxide and water, and through that they produce metabolic energy to grow food,
[03:34:56.460 --> 03:35:01.460]  to grow fruits and vegetables, leaves and tree trunks and so on, grasses and everything.
[03:35:01.460 --> 03:35:05.460]  But as a byproduct of photosynthesis, they release oxygen.
[03:35:05.460 --> 03:35:13.460]  Now the inputs of photosynthesis being sunlight and carbon dioxide are now deemed bad by the globalists.
[03:35:13.460 --> 03:35:16.460]  The globalists say carbon dioxide is a pollutant.
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:21.460]  They say carbon dioxide is bad, they have a war on carbon, they want to destroy all carbon dioxide,
[03:35:21.460 --> 03:35:27.460]  which would of course kill essentially all life on the planet except maybe anaerobic microbes and so on.
[03:35:27.460 --> 03:35:36.460]  They want to kill plants, they want to kill forests, they want to kill humans and collapse the entire food supply by eliminating carbon dioxide.
[03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:37.460]  That's what it would do.
[03:35:37.460 --> 03:35:39.460]  But now they want to kill the sun.
[03:35:39.460 --> 03:35:43.460]  See, they want to dim the sun by releasing pollution into the upper atmosphere.
[03:35:43.460 --> 03:35:51.460]  So with this, they are collapsing the two primary inputs that all plants need to perform photosynthesis.
[03:35:51.460 --> 03:36:01.460]  If you shut off the sunlight and you shut off, well, let me just ask you, what happens in your backyard if you put a bucket, let's say, over a patch of grass?
[03:36:01.460 --> 03:36:02.460]  What happens?
[03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:04.460]  Well, the grass turns yellow and it dies, right?
[03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:08.460]  No sunlight, no plant life, everything dies.
[03:36:08.460 --> 03:36:11.460]  So you might ask, well, why are they trying to dim the sun now?
[03:36:11.460 --> 03:36:14.460]  Why are they trying to starve all plants of their source of energy?
[03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:16.460]  Yeah, that's the point.
[03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:17.460]  That's what they're trying to do.
[03:36:17.460 --> 03:36:20.460]  Also, if you take away carbon dioxide, what happens?
[03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:32.460]  Well, greenhouses out there, they have to purchase carbon dioxide generators to make carbon dioxide so that their greenhouse plants grow more efficiently and produce more flowers or more crops.
[03:36:32.460 --> 03:36:34.460]  Why do they have to do that?
[03:36:34.460 --> 03:36:39.460]  Because carbon dioxide is so low in the atmosphere today, it's barely 400 parts per million.
[03:36:39.460 --> 03:36:42.460]  It's a very tiny fraction of the atmosphere.
[03:36:42.460 --> 03:36:45.460]  It's so low that plants are starving for CO2.
[03:36:45.460 --> 03:36:55.460]  And that's why we have deserts, or it's part of the reason why, also, of course, lack of water, but you could reclaim a lot of deserts that have sufficient rainfall right now.
[03:36:55.460 --> 03:36:58.460]  But there's just not enough CO2 for those plants to survive.
[03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:04.460]  If you had more CO2 and sufficient sunlight, plants would flourish all over the world.
[03:37:04.460 --> 03:37:12.460]  So why do the globalists and the climate change alarmists want to shut off sunlight and shut off carbon dioxide?
[03:37:12.460 --> 03:37:15.460]  Because they're trying to murder the world.
[03:37:15.460 --> 03:37:18.460]  There's no other conclusion.
[03:37:18.460 --> 03:37:19.460]  They're trying to murder the world.
[03:37:19.460 --> 03:37:23.460]  So if you cut off those two things, what happens to the global food supply?
[03:37:23.460 --> 03:37:27.460]  You know, maybe you purchased some storable food recently.
[03:37:27.460 --> 03:37:32.460]  That's a pretty good idea because if the globalists get their way, they will collapse the global food supply.
[03:37:32.460 --> 03:37:35.460]  Food crops can't produce food without sunlight.
[03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:37.460]  They can't produce food without CO2.
[03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:45.460]  The food supply will collapse, and this will, of course, lead to civil unrest and mass migration.
[03:37:45.460 --> 03:37:52.460]  As the food supply collapses in third world countries, you'll see more migrant caravans heading into first world nations to try to invade them.
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:57.460]  You might think that the globalists love this plan, and they do.
[03:37:57.460 --> 03:37:59.460]  They want emergencies in third world countries.
[03:37:59.460 --> 03:38:08.460]  They want mass starvation and crises all over the world in Africa, in the Middle East, in Central and South America, and so on.
[03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:17.460]  Because they know that will invade first world countries, and that will cause first world countries to be overrun to where they will politically surrender to the globalist agenda,
[03:38:17.460 --> 03:38:24.460]  which is necessary for them to complete their plan to exterminate human life on the planet.
[03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:29.460]  Other effects of dimming the sun.
[03:38:29.460 --> 03:38:33.460]  Well, what happens if you cut off plant metabolism?
[03:38:33.460 --> 03:38:35.460]  You also cut off the production of oxygen.
[03:38:35.460 --> 03:38:43.460]  The oxygen that you are breathing comes from trees and rainforests and grasses and even ocean life.
[03:38:43.460 --> 03:38:48.460]  There's a lot of life in the ocean near the surface of the water that uses photosynthesis.
[03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:55.460]  See weeds and see grasses and algae in the ocean that use sunlight as a form of energy.
[03:38:55.460 --> 03:39:04.460]  And throughout the ocean, there are mammals, for example, whales and dolphins and so on, that need oxygen just like you and I do.
[03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:11.460]  And if the oxygen levels drop to any of those life forms, including us, then we die.
[03:39:11.460 --> 03:39:13.460]  You could go maybe a month without food.
[03:39:13.460 --> 03:39:16.460]  You can survive maybe two, three days without water.
[03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:19.460]  How long can you survive without oxygen?
[03:39:19.460 --> 03:39:22.460]  Maybe three minutes, maybe five minutes max.
[03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:28.460]  And even then you'd probably be in a coma for the rest of your life with severe permanent brain damage.
[03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:35.460]  The globalists know that the most effective way to destroy humanity and literally exterminate the human race is to cut off the oxygen.
[03:39:35.460 --> 03:39:37.460]  And that's what this plan is doing.
[03:39:37.460 --> 03:39:42.460]  So if you spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere and you keep doing it enough, you dim the sun.
[03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:49.460]  And just to review here, you dim the sun, you slow the metabolism of plants, plants produce less oxygen, oxygen levels drop.
[03:39:49.460 --> 03:39:53.460]  The world asphyxiates if you continue that enough.
[03:39:53.460 --> 03:39:55.460]  And that is part of the plan.
[03:39:55.460 --> 03:39:58.460]  This is why I call this terraforming.
[03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:00.460]  Why would they want to reduce oxygen on the planet?
[03:40:00.460 --> 03:40:02.460]  Why would they want to alter the atmosphere?
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:04.460]  Why would they want to dim the sun and collapse the food supply?
[03:40:04.460 --> 03:40:06.460]  Who would do that?
[03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:11.460]  Nobody that loves humanity, that's for sure.
[03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:16.460]  You would also, by the way, have massive global acid rain.
[03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:22.460]  So when you spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, you cause, of course, acid rain.
[03:40:22.460 --> 03:40:28.460]  If the sulfur dioxide gets low enough to where it mixes with the rain clouds and rain storms,
[03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:36.460]  now rain clouds and large super storms can exist at altitudes that are very, very high, over 60,000 feet, for example.
[03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:39.460]  Much higher than where airplanes typically fly.
[03:40:39.460 --> 03:40:42.460]  Some storms can do that, not all, but some.
[03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:45.460]  So you'd have sulfur dioxide mixing with those rain clouds.
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:54.460]  And then you'd be raining down acid rain on every river, every forest, every farm, every city, every ocean.
[03:40:54.460 --> 03:40:57.460]  So you'd be contributing to ocean acidification.
[03:40:57.460 --> 03:41:04.460]  You'd be contributing to the acid rainfall on food crops and the acidification of soils.
[03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.460]  What would be the effect of this?
[03:41:06.460 --> 03:41:12.460]  Well, of course, massive death of both food crops as well as forest ecosystems.
[03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:16.460]  You can't just rain down acid on the world and expect everything to be okay.
[03:41:16.460 --> 03:41:22.460]  In fact, you know, it's funny because environmentalists for years have been telling us that coal-fired power plants are bad.
[03:41:22.460 --> 03:41:27.460]  Why? Well, because they're releasing sulfur into the atmosphere and CO2.
[03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:32.460]  And they say CO2 is bad and they say sulfur is bad. It's a polluted. It's horrible, they say.
[03:41:32.460 --> 03:41:35.460]  Of course, they also think CO2 is a pollutant.
[03:41:35.460 --> 03:41:45.460]  Now, the climate change pushers are saying they want to release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere with chemtrailing, with geoengineering.
[03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:50.460]  They want to do it. They're calling it. They're calling for it. They want a budget to do it even more.
[03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:52.460]  Of course, they're already doing it now.
[03:41:52.460 --> 03:41:56.460]  So if that's the case, then what's the argument against coal-fired power plants then?
[03:41:56.460 --> 03:42:02.460]  I thought you told us those were polluting the world. Now you want to pollute the world and call it green?
[03:42:02.460 --> 03:42:08.460]  See, everything that liberals believe is a contradiction. Everything is a fairytale.
[03:42:08.460 --> 03:42:14.460]  And they don't know real science because the real science of this situation is a death sentence for humanity.
[03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:20.460]  And it's a death sentence for ecology. It's a death sentence for the fragile food webs of the ocean.
[03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:30.460]  It's a death sentence for the natural world from which we derive our food, our water, our land, our very survivability, our sustainability.
[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:32.460]  The globalists want to destroy it all.
[03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:35.460]  And believe it or not, I've got even more details about this.
[03:42:35.460 --> 03:42:41.460]  When we come back here on the Alex Jones show, we are being targeted by the globalists for termination.
[03:42:41.460 --> 03:42:46.460]  It's not a science fiction movie. It's reality that's happening right now. That's why we better fight back.
[03:42:46.460 --> 03:43:11.460]  There's more straight ahead. Stay with us.
[03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:18.460]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:24.460]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:31.460]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:43:31.460 --> 03:43:45.460]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:43:45.460 --> 03:43:49.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.460 --> 03:44:04.460]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.

[03:45:53.460 --> 03:46:07.460]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:46:07.460 --> 03:46:15.460]  People say, why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:46:15.460 --> 03:46:25.460]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
[03:46:25.460 --> 03:46:36.460]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[03:46:36.460 --> 03:46:46.460]  We have huge sales at infowords.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[03:46:46.460 --> 03:47:07.460]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Glove will swing when. This is InfoWords Darker Sour, we're your support, I'm counting on you.
[03:47:16.460 --> 03:47:29.460]  What I hate is hitting roadblocks on a highway in my way.
[03:47:29.460 --> 03:47:41.460]  The most important thing to remember here is that when you're fighting against the globalists, you're fighting not just for political freedom or economic freedom, you're fighting for the very survival of the human race.
[03:47:41.460 --> 03:47:50.460]  That's what's become apparent in all of this. Let me show you how the globalists push propaganda to convince the human race to commit suicide.
[03:47:50.460 --> 03:48:02.460]  Because that's really what's happening here. Humanity has become a suicide cult that's following a script that's been handed to them by globalists who are intending on exterminating the human race.
[03:48:02.460 --> 03:48:15.460]  So the producers find this screenshot. It's Time Magazine here, sorry, 1977, and it talks about global cooling and the cover of the magazine says, How to Survive the Coming Ice Age.
[03:48:15.460 --> 03:48:27.460]  Time Magazine, 1977. How to Survive the Coming Ice Age, and it shows a penguin there. They always try to use Arctic animals, it seems, like polar bears or penguins.
[03:48:27.460 --> 03:48:38.460]  So back in the 1970s and even in the early 1980s, they said, No, the world's going to freeze. It's going to be a giant frozen ice ball like the ice planet Hoth from the Empire Strikes Back.
[03:48:38.460 --> 03:48:45.460]  And if you're going to survive the coming ice age, they said, then you have to take all these actions. You have to give up your power to the globalists.
[03:48:45.460 --> 03:48:51.460]  And even in this Time Magazine cover, they have 51 things you can do to make a difference.
[03:48:51.460 --> 03:48:57.460]  Because the planet's going to freeze, they said. And this is what all the scientists of the time were taught.
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:49:03.460]  And I know this, I work with a lot of scientists and some of the colleagues that I work with, they were telling me how, I mean, they're close to retirement today.
[03:49:03.460 --> 03:49:09.460]  But when they were students, their professors told them, Oh my gosh, the planet's going to freeze. The ice age is coming.
[03:49:09.460 --> 03:49:16.460]  And if we don't do something, if we don't let the government take control, we're all going to freeze to death.
[03:49:16.460 --> 03:49:22.460]  Well, they flipped the script in the 1990s. They say, Oh no, no, it's global warming.
[03:49:22.460 --> 03:49:27.460]  That's what's going to kill everybody. So you have to give all your power to the government to stop global warming.
[03:49:27.460 --> 03:49:35.460]  And then after 15 years of no warming data, they said, Well, gosh, we can't go back to global cooling because nobody will believe that again.
[03:49:35.460 --> 03:49:44.460]  So they came up with climate change. And climate change, of course, now can encompass anything because the natural climate is always changing.
[03:49:44.460 --> 03:49:52.460]  The history of the planet is a history of tornadoes, hurricanes, forest fires, droughts, long before the industrial age.
[03:49:52.460 --> 03:50:00.460]  In fact, these liberals today, they're so ignorant of reality. They think that there were no forest fires before the year 1920,
[03:50:00.460 --> 03:50:05.460]  because that's when the combustion engine really came on the scene in mass production.
[03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:13.460]  So they actually think there were no earthquakes. There were no plate tectonics. Nothing bad happened on Earth.
[03:50:13.460 --> 03:50:18.460]  It was the serene tranquil paradise before 1920, they think.
[03:50:18.460 --> 03:50:25.460]  Well, have they ever looked around at, I don't know, mountain ranges? Have they looked at the Earth from satellite?
[03:50:25.460 --> 03:50:38.460]  Have they seen the incredible cataclysmic events, the volcanoes, the earthquakes, the fires that obviously have been taking place ever since forest and lightning have existed?
[03:50:38.460 --> 03:50:50.460]  The Earth has not been a serene place, but now by saying it's climate change, well, they can blame everything on human activity and they can push this agenda to exterminate humanity.
[03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:58.460]  Now, let's go into a little bit of a what-if science fiction scenario here, because I want to explore some thoughts with you.
[03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:05.460]  You might be wondering, well, who's really behind this? If it's not the globalists, who are the globalists taking orders from?
[03:51:05.460 --> 03:51:15.460]  Now, I can't prove this scenario. This is a what-if scenario. It's science fiction, but let's go into this science fiction scenario and see where it takes us.
[03:51:15.460 --> 03:51:29.460]  If you were an advanced civilization and you wanted to conquer and colonize planets all across the universe, you would build, probably, artificial intelligence space drones and you would unleash them just like actually in the Empire Strikes Back,
[03:51:29.460 --> 03:51:36.460]  come to think of it, they had little drones that would go check out the planets and see where those life and gather data and so on.
[03:51:36.460 --> 03:51:46.460]  This is what NASA has done with the landers on Mars and other spacecraft going out into the universe, frankly, beyond our current solar system.
[03:51:46.460 --> 03:52:00.460]  This is a natural thing to send automated units out to explore other planets and see what's going on, but let's say that there are other civilizations that are millions of years more advanced than ours.
[03:52:00.460 --> 03:52:13.460]  So they've had millions of years to send out AI drones all across the universe to find the best planets, planets that are just the right distance from the sun, planets that have liquid water, planets that have an atmosphere, planets that have the right minerals.
[03:52:13.460 --> 03:52:25.460]  Gosh, sounds like earth, earth, earth, doesn't it? Earth is a really valuable planet and that's a universal thing that anyone would recognize in the universe, any living system would recognize that, just like we recognize it.
[03:52:25.460 --> 03:52:33.460]  You know, carbon-based life forms are probably very, you know, carbon is the universal element for life, probably everywhere.
[03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:43.460]  And so if these drones were to come across a planet like earth and found, gosh, well, there's indigenous life forms living there.
[03:52:43.460 --> 03:52:48.460]  That's us, by the way. There are indigenous life forms. What do you do with those life forms?
[03:52:48.460 --> 03:52:58.460]  Well, if you go back to old, like, Star Trek episodes and you find stories of aliens that would try to exterminate life on those planets so they could take them over.
[03:52:58.460 --> 03:53:15.460]  But we need to think in a more advanced way than that. That's kind of old school, just to go kill off all the life forms and then take over the planet and steal their water and everything else you've seen in science fiction movies, including Oblivion with Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, which I highly recommend you watch again.
[03:53:15.460 --> 03:53:19.460]  That's a very interesting parallel to that film. It's called Oblivion.
[03:53:19.460 --> 03:53:29.460]  But a more advanced AI system, which has millions of years of R&D technology behind it, would be smarter than to just kill off the life forms.
[03:53:29.460 --> 03:53:36.460]  That AI system would convince the indigenous life forms to kill themselves.
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:53.460]  That AI life form would make contact with the leaders of that planet and convince them to maybe terraform the planet so that your own indigenous species dies off and the planet is ready for whatever comes next.
[03:53:53.460 --> 03:53:58.460]  Is that happening? I don't know. Again, this is a what if scenario.
[03:53:58.460 --> 03:54:08.460]  But isn't it interesting that our globalists appear to be acting against the interests of Earth and against the interests of humans?
[03:54:08.460 --> 03:54:19.460]  They appear to be acting with some otherworldly agenda and you could even go into the spiritual realm and you could say, well, maybe it's a spiritual war and they are satanic.
[03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:22.460]  They're demons. They're possessed by demons.
[03:54:22.460 --> 03:54:32.460]  What if those demons are actually perhaps artificial intelligence systems that have been able to influence globalists into destroying their own planet?
[03:54:32.460 --> 03:54:37.460]  See, I'm just exploring what if scenarios. Maybe this is a spiritual battle.
[03:54:37.460 --> 03:54:47.460]  In fact, I'm sure it is. But maybe there's also an AI system that has targeted us and has convinced our globalists to destroy humanity.
[03:54:47.460 --> 03:54:53.460]  And they've convinced people to commit suicide in the name of saving their own planet.
[03:54:53.460 --> 03:55:02.460]  Now that would be genius from the point of view of a conquering civilization that is trying to spread itself out across the cosmos.
[03:55:02.460 --> 03:55:07.460]  Again, I'm not saying that this is actually the case. I'm just exploring what if scenarios.
[03:55:07.460 --> 03:55:16.460]  Because when you have your own world leaders who are committing suicide, who are trying to line up Earth in the target zone to be exterminated,
[03:55:16.460 --> 03:55:20.460]  you have to start asking really big questions like the questions I'm asking today.
[03:55:20.460 --> 03:55:25.460]  Questions of what's driving these people? What is their big picture mission here?
[03:55:25.460 --> 03:55:30.460]  Are they insane or are they actually following some other script?
[03:55:30.460 --> 03:55:38.460]  And where is that script coming from? Who is influencing their thoughts, their decision processes?
[03:55:38.460 --> 03:55:40.460]  Where is this coming from?
[03:55:40.460 --> 03:55:47.460]  So I invite you, as we all move through our lives here together, we're on the same timeline here.
[03:55:47.460 --> 03:55:51.460]  We all exist today, the same moment on the same planet.
[03:55:51.460 --> 03:55:55.460]  We're dealing with the same politics, the same environment, the same pollution.
[03:55:55.460 --> 03:56:03.460]  I invite you to start observing who is anti-human versus who is pro-human.
[03:56:03.460 --> 03:56:06.460]  Because that's the division that matters most.
[03:56:06.460 --> 03:56:12.460]  Now, President Trump is pro-human. That's become very clear. Info wars is pro-human.
[03:56:12.460 --> 03:56:21.460]  Alex Jones is pro-human. And no matter what else you think about Trump or Info wars or myself or others, we are all pro-human.
[03:56:21.460 --> 03:56:23.460]  We love humanity. We want to see humanity survive.
[03:56:23.460 --> 03:56:31.460]  But the anti-human forces are the environmentalists, believe it or not, who are pushing this climate change global pollution,
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:36.460]  spraying high altitude stratospheric aerosol injections. They're anti-human.
[03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:41.460]  The abortion pushes are anti-human. The globalists are anti-human.
[03:56:41.460 --> 03:56:46.460]  The EPA is poisoning the world for humanity, meaning the EPA is anti-human.
[03:56:46.460 --> 03:56:51.460]  This is the delineation that matters most. It's not whether you're Republican or Democrat.
[03:56:51.460 --> 03:56:57.460]  It's not even populism versus globalism. It's about whether you are pro-human or anti-human.
[03:56:57.460 --> 03:57:02.460]  That is what matters most. And I dare say, as I wrap up this show today,
[03:57:02.460 --> 03:57:10.460]  we must stop these mad scientists and we must stop these globalists using every legal means at our disposal,
[03:57:10.460 --> 03:57:17.460]  or we, the human race, will cease to exist. They will exterminate us if we allow them to.
[03:57:17.460 --> 03:57:22.460]  But don't surrender to the globalists or we lose forever. We lose our future.
[03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:27.460]  We lose our planet. We lose our grandchildren. We lose our gene pool. It's over.
[03:57:27.460 --> 03:57:30.460]  Fight for liberty, but fight for humanity as well. That's the big picture.
[03:57:30.460 --> 03:57:53.460]  Thanks for joining me today. Mike Adams here for the Alice Jones Show. Take care.
