[00:31.440 --> 00:38.440]  true birth of the monstrosity of the abomination known as the first true
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.520]  world government which is really itself an extermination grid so we'll be
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.040]  breaking that down today we've got Bob Chapman joining us for an hour to take

[00:51.640 --> 00:59.760]  visit with us then we have Janine Roberts she is a British lady and well
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.720]  we've had her on I guess about six seven eight years ago I first saw her with
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.440]  her documentary that aired on PBS I'd already learned this when I was a child
[01:10.440 --> 01:15.400]  because my dad had friends that were in the international diamond business they
[01:15.400 --> 01:19.200]  were a French South Africans and so he told me it was all monopoly and there
[01:19.200 --> 01:24.040]  were giant warehouses of diamonds and the diamonds were semi-precious I mean
[01:24.040 --> 01:27.200]  literally worth the same amount as rhinestones but people will mortgage
[01:27.200 --> 01:32.200]  their houses or two or three years pay you know just to buy their wife or
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.840]  sweetie a big diamond and I halfway didn't believe my dad but I knew he
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.480]  didn't make stuff up and then I remember when I was a teenager I saw her
[01:43.480 --> 01:48.240]  Diamond Empire film now I didn't know because it wasn't in the news that they
[01:48.240 --> 01:51.760]  went on her yacht told her you shouldn't have made that movie broker knows
[01:51.760 --> 01:57.320]  knocks over teeth out and she's married to a British Lord she's pretty powerful
[01:57.320 --> 02:01.480]  it's one of these smart rich ladies so I guess in her spare time likes to go out
[02:01.480 --> 02:07.520]  and make films very good filmmaker travel all over the world because she was
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.440]  high up in the British system they even let her into the the mines some of the
[02:12.440 --> 02:17.000]  only footage ever out of those mild deep mines where they've got huge air
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.920]  conditioners injecting ACN because it would be a hundred and fifty degrees if
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.880]  they didn't and they let her into the huge warehouses just as far as the I
[02:25.880 --> 02:32.440]  could see giant chest of diamonds and a lot has developed since I had her on I
[02:32.440 --> 02:42.200]  think it was pre-911 so we'll have her back on the show today Janine Roberts
[02:42.200 --> 02:51.040]  we'll talk about her new book on the scams that are run with diamonds and then
[02:51.040 --> 02:54.560]  we've got Barbara love Fisher you know you the enemy has struck back we've been
[02:54.560 --> 03:03.720]  exposing the fact that autism in many cases is linked to the Marisol Mercury
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.200]  preservative in the vaccines that are still in the vaccines they'll lie and
[03:07.200 --> 03:10.160]  say they're out but then you read the inserts it's all still there like they
[03:10.160 --> 03:15.760]  increase the amount of the Marisol in most vaccines from 100 times safe levels
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.560]  to 500 times safe levels in the case of the flu shot you can even find that AP
[03:20.560 --> 03:23.440]  headline they just said we have no reason to do this we're not gonna tell you
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.560]  why you're trying to escape our shots how about five times the amount how's

[03:31.680 --> 03:34.440]  will sit there gullibly and take it because you can't imagine where that
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.600]  evil that's the whole system so we'll have Barbara low Fisher co-founder of
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.680]  the nonprofit National Vaccine Information Center who was involved very
[03:44.680 --> 03:49.800]  closely with this federal court paid for by the vaccine companies their own
[03:49.800 --> 03:57.280]  kangaroo court saying we decide there's no evidence of this causing problems so
[03:57.280 --> 04:06.240]  we'll break that down with her today in the fourth hour in the meantime there is

[08:09.280 --> 08:17.840]  Jones and the GCN radio network the nation has been seized by open wanton
[08:17.840 --> 08:24.640]  criminals engaging in every crime known to man they have high-tech propaganda
[08:24.640 --> 08:29.440]  systems busily brainwashing the public manipulating the public with every
[08:29.440 --> 08:37.720]  psychological warfare tactic known testing their systems upon the slaves and
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.240]  until we realize this and say we're not slaves and we see through your matrix
[08:41.240 --> 08:52.320]  illusion it's only going to get worse now Obama has unveiled his actual tax
[08:52.320 --> 08:59.680]  plan as of last night you know he promised no new taxes except for people
[08:59.680 --> 09:09.240]  making over $250,000 a year that's joint incomes and that's going to hurt the
[09:09.240 --> 09:12.400]  economy in a big way I know most people think that somebody making quarter
[09:12.400 --> 09:18.480]  million dollars a year is rich but by the time they devalue the currency at
[09:18.480 --> 09:24.320]  right now 15% inflation a year it's going to move into over 20% all that's
[09:24.320 --> 09:31.000]  going to do is those yuppies and the lawyers and the doctors and the person
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.680]  that owns a restaurant or whatever a successful restaurant they're not going
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.760]  to come in your little boutique and buy your little sweaters and shoes they're
[09:40.760 --> 09:43.520]  not going to come in your little grocery store they're not going to buy wine
[09:43.520 --> 09:47.920]  they're not going to come in your car dealership and buy a car from you if
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.960]  you're a car salesman and things will get worse and worse the economy and
[09:52.960 --> 09:55.800]  then everybody will basically go in welfare and they've announced that
[09:55.800 --> 10:00.360]  they're going to give you a national ID card with little credits on it and you'll
[10:00.360 --> 10:03.880]  live in tiny government housing and you'll be disarmed and you'll have
[10:03.880 --> 10:06.280]  gangs running around shooting you and killing you and the police will just
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.640]  cordon off the reservation area and you'll sit there just looking up with
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.360]  love at Obama on the TV screen loving him you'll probably even have a little
[10:14.360 --> 10:18.600]  they're not probably they're announcing a little uniform for yourself to feel
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.000]  good a little cell phone to tattle on neighbors you'll feel very important
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.680]  they're setting it all up I mean you couldn't make this up it's so crazy it's
[10:30.680 --> 10:36.760]  really happening here all set up for decades North comm the systems of
[10:36.760 --> 10:40.560]  control all being built the architecture being constructed and now
[10:40.560 --> 10:48.440]  Obama's announcing basically taxes on everything you know his carbon tax
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.160]  alone will shut down many of the businesses many of the places where a
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.520]  few Americans were still employed those that stay open will have to up their
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.760]  prices they won't be able to compete with China and India and 160 other third
[11:03.760 --> 11:07.480]  world countries that have no carbon emission controls and so they will end
[11:07.480 --> 11:14.560]  up shutting down so that's a huge tax on everybody that's just the first tax
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.120]  there's there's hundreds in the carbon tax family being implemented by cities
[11:19.120 --> 11:25.520]  and counties everywhere and they've got taxes now on charity I don't don't don't
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.360]  don't give the charity and they're going to have taxes on capital gains and
[11:30.360 --> 11:40.960]  they're going to have taxes on basically everything now we've broken down the
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.160]  fact that about 200 billion dollars of the 787 billion dollar stimulus package
[11:46.160 --> 11:49.560]  will actually go to the people in some form or fashion but with federal strings
[11:49.560 --> 11:56.080]  attached so 200 billion versus 9.7 trillion to the bankers domestically
[11:56.080 --> 12:00.720]  and then tens of trillions worldwide you know England putting in 500 and
[12:00.720 --> 12:04.720]  something billion France putting in 400 something billion the Dutch putting in
[12:04.720 --> 12:07.400]  hundreds of billions the Japanese putting in hundreds of billions the
[12:07.400 --> 12:12.040]  Chinese putting in hundreds of billions those are going into the private banks
[12:12.040 --> 12:15.800]  with all these governments held hostage saying okay we'll do whatever you say
[12:15.800 --> 12:22.360]  just let the credit flow let the credit flow the banks go no we want more now
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.880]  and so you get 200 billion with strings attached the the only tax cut out there
[12:29.880 --> 12:39.840]  for people under $250,000 a year joint incomes that's a 125,000 a piece the
[12:39.840 --> 12:46.320]  only tax decrease is what 15 and a half dollars every two weeks a pizza every
[12:46.320 --> 12:52.440]  two weeks so so yes a pizza every two weeks and Obama's budget is three and
[12:52.440 --> 12:57.920]  a half trillion and he just announced now that he wants another 800 and
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.440]  something billion on top of the one plus trillion defense budget I mean he said
[13:03.440 --> 13:09.520]  he wanted a bigger military a military buildup and it's happening and that's
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.360]  it and then most the big defense contractors are subcontracting out the
[13:14.360 --> 13:19.640]  components of the weapons systems to China and Europe and other nations
[13:19.640 --> 13:25.040]  they're making a lot of defense department components in Mexico now they're
[13:25.040 --> 13:29.560]  taking a billion bucks of the General Motors bailout and building a plant down
[13:29.560 --> 13:36.920]  in Brazil they're all globalists it's a big joke a big looting celebration by
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.440]  the ruling class they don't want a free market they don't want a good economy
[13:41.440 --> 13:47.200]  they don't want you doing well Israel wants their country to do well and so
[13:47.200 --> 13:50.400]  they're just cutting taxes across the board no tax increases and that will
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.080]  help their economy more money comes into the Treasury when you cut taxes and
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.800]  that's a historical fact because people spend more they keep more of their money
[13:59.800 --> 14:06.920]  that is the best way to spend money into the economy this is control I mean
[14:06.920 --> 14:11.120]  having all this talk of nationalization and constant talk by world leaders of
[14:11.120 --> 14:17.360]  depression is destroying confidence in the economy so that they can have a
[14:17.360 --> 14:20.960]  fire sale and then people email me accusing me oh all your bad mouthing of
[14:20.960 --> 14:26.520]  the economy Alex you've caused all this I get that every day I see it in the
[14:26.520 --> 14:32.160]  comments no we explained the bankers were going to blame it on the subprime
[14:32.160 --> 14:35.240]  mortgage there had nothing to do with notice then day one they said that
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.440]  wasn't what the bailout was for when they said it was all along and that they
[14:39.440 --> 14:42.400]  were then gonna badmouth the economy drive it down and set up a new bank of
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.560]  the world that you pay carbon taxes to and exactly that has happened and I've
[14:46.560 --> 14:53.040]  been telling you that for a decade we pinned we pegged we fingered the fact
[14:53.040 --> 14:56.480]  that they would blame it on subprime three years ago a year and a half before
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.520]  that even started we're on record in a triplicate we told you Mexico was gonna
[15:01.520 --> 15:07.320]  be collapsed by design with a right-wing government they were gonna put in even
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.800]  before Fox left before Colorado was on the radar screen and it would collapse
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.680]  and that they would have martial law on the border and actually issue some new
[15:15.680 --> 15:23.080]  regional ID card to legalize the illegal aliens it's now happening so I'm gonna
[15:23.080 --> 15:26.960]  say it again to the skeptics out there you better listen I know you have this
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.440]  false idea about the world it's like your little your little teddy bear you're
[15:30.440 --> 15:36.560]  busy be you snuggle with at night your little chew toy you're like a two-year-old
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.440]  and you're in love with this false image of America and this false image of who
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.880]  you are in it and let me tell you something your bosses in the new world
[15:45.880 --> 15:52.520]  order are gonna hurt you bad they don't care about you one sin tell us in fact
[15:52.520 --> 15:56.040]  they enjoy hurting you
[15:56.040 --> 16:15.040]  you and here come the taxes one of the taxes alone is a trillion dollar tax
[16:15.040 --> 16:20.440]  increase and they're changing look look this already happened with taxes and
[16:20.440 --> 16:23.880]  anybody who pays taxes you know most folks have their money withheld so they
[16:23.880 --> 16:26.840]  don't realize how much is being taken from them they don't realize their
[16:26.840 --> 16:35.680]  employer has to match the social security Medicare Medicaid funding let's
[16:35.680 --> 16:43.160]  say you make $20 an hour and you've got to pay on average five six dollars of
[16:43.160 --> 16:48.640]  that in taxes in a large portion of that social security your employer has to
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.480]  match that so see you're really making $28 an hour
[16:57.320 --> 17:01.160]  let's say you're making ten bucks an hour but you end up getting about seven
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.960]  and a half dollars on each check your employer is really paying you $13 an
[17:05.960 --> 17:13.640]  hour but in the tax breaks in the tax system they've gotten rid for the little
[17:13.640 --> 17:21.680]  people of almost all the loopholes you can't even buy equipment now and or
[17:21.680 --> 17:25.560]  raw materials for your business or company and write it all off in most
[17:25.560 --> 17:30.360]  cases but then meanwhile it comes out in mainstream news that literally no one
[17:30.360 --> 17:33.800]  in the Obama administration is paying taxes
[17:33.800 --> 17:39.000]  Rahm Emanuel lives in free palace size houses paid for by billionaires when
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.680]  he's a congressman when he's a white house chief of staff they drive around in
[17:42.680 --> 17:46.840]  free limos free helicopters free everything the guy back when he was
[17:46.840 --> 17:50.480]  working for a big brokerage firm ripping folks off was making between 15 and 18
[17:50.480 --> 17:55.160]  million dollars a year this is just Rahm Emanuel he is for total gun ban of
[17:55.160 --> 18:01.360]  the American people like complete criminal and I mean he's tied in to all
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.840]  the Chicago mobsters all the big money this is on record and he doesn't pay

[24:27.080 --> 24:32.520]  controlled Saddam Hussein and used him as a kamikaze military system against
[24:32.520 --> 24:39.280]  the Iranians in the 80s that was declassified the mid 90s and it was to
[24:39.280 --> 24:43.400]  break the country up basically like it is now but in permanent basis over the
[24:43.400 --> 24:50.240]  three regions have a puppet unification government and then going back five and
[24:50.240 --> 24:53.800]  a half years ago after they invaded and took over they stated we're going to
[24:53.800 --> 24:58.240]  build all these permanent bases giant embassies and never leave that they will
[24:58.240 --> 25:03.400]  be there they said in a hundred years and then Bush would say oh we're going to
[25:03.400 --> 25:12.040]  look in 16 months that's their favorite number at then setting a day and Obama
[25:12.040 --> 25:16.040]  said nope day one we're going to pull the troops out then he said well six
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.640]  months and then 16 months and then well 23 months and then we're going to look
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.160]  at what we're going to do and it's just going to be the main combat force we're
[25:24.160 --> 25:29.400]  still going to have our troops there so it's double speak and the left would
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.160]  deny that and say no he didn't say that no you watch you watch I'm like here's
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.120]  the defense department he's keeping gates on now he's publicly announced it
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.400]  and suddenly the left on a CNN and MSNBC you know those fake left shows are
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.480]  hey we're getting tough against Al Qaeda what do you expect we have to and I
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.040]  ran to deadly they're about to destroy us we've got a got to hit them got to
[25:52.040 --> 26:00.920]  strike them now and all these new taxes on the entire population and you talk to
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.400]  people the Kool-Aid drinkers and it's just like people that supported Bush who
[26:04.400 --> 26:07.800]  were Kool-Aid drinkers it didn't matter you know he'd be for the assault weapons
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.160]  ban and they'd say no he's not liar I go okay well here is lobbying Congress and
[26:12.160 --> 26:18.040]  here's the Associated Press what I guess you like Democrats then I'm like no I
[26:18.040 --> 26:21.800]  like the second amendment can we just admit that both parties are anti-
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.800]  second amendment can we get our country back
[26:30.480 --> 26:36.400]  it's just horrible what's happening and they know that during a contracting
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.120]  economy you don't want more taxes but they're doing it in fact let's play this
[26:40.120 --> 26:43.680]  little CNN piece that's actually pretty shocking because it's somewhat accurate
[26:43.680 --> 26:53.280]  dealing with taxes here it is if you're one of the millions of wealthy
[26:53.280 --> 26:56.920]  Americans Carol you're gonna get stuck with the bag here on this I think so you
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.280]  know though but the president's job isn't easy he needs money and lots of it
[27:00.280 --> 27:03.840]  and where do you find money these days well you find it in the pockets of those
[27:03.840 --> 27:11.920]  who have it it is a daunting task by the end of this fiscal year America will
[27:11.920 --> 27:18.400]  have a deficit to the tune of 1.75 trillion dollars how do you cut that in
[27:18.400 --> 27:25.720]  half by 2013 and pay for pricey new programs at least in part by taxing the
[27:25.720 --> 27:29.460]  rich and we'll save billions of dollars by rolling back tax cuts for the
[27:29.460 --> 27:35.420]  wealthiest Americans while giving a middle-class tax cut to 95% of hard
[27:35.420 --> 27:40.840]  working families not unexpected 250 thousand dollars a year 250 thousand
[27:40.840 --> 27:46.040]  dollars a year yes asking the folks who are making more than 250 thousand
[27:46.040 --> 27:51.560]  dollars a year a quarter million dollars a year to go back to the tax rates
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.720]  they were paying in the 1990s mr. Obama has talked about taxing the rich ever
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.720]  since swell Joe the plumber when you spread the wealth around it's good
[27:59.720 --> 28:04.480]  back then spreading the wealth meant mr. Obama would let the bush impose tax
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.200]  cuts for the wealthy expire today it means a whole lot more the president is
[28:09.200 --> 28:14.360]  also proposing to reduce deductions on mortgage interest and on charitable
[28:14.360 --> 28:19.720]  contributions raise taxes on capital gains and dividends and require wealthy
[28:19.720 --> 28:24.040]  Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for medical care and prescription drugs
[28:24.040 --> 28:31.560]  lady a woman of your beauty has no need for such decorations all right it
[28:31.560 --> 28:37.040]  pause you know I say somewhat truthful it's actually pure deception the info
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.600]  is accurate but it's all oh he's got a tough job oh he's got to do it oh you
[28:41.600 --> 28:44.480]  know he's taxing the rich redefining somebody making a hundred twenty five
[28:44.480 --> 28:47.840]  thousand dollars a year is rich when that's middle-class and that's who
[28:47.840 --> 28:50.720]  were literally funds the economy the rich hold on to their money the
[28:50.720 --> 28:55.520]  billionaires the people to control trillions and then they bill Obama as
[28:55.520 --> 29:01.280]  Robin Hood oh he's robbing from the rich giving to the poor and the poor like
[29:01.280 --> 29:07.920]  yes get the person that makes a hundred twenty five thousand a year meanwhile I
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.160]  don't know what's 200 million that actually went to the people $15 of every
[29:12.160 --> 29:21.280]  two weeks versus the fact that 9.7 trillion 90 plus percent of the money's
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.360]  going to offshore banks the true elite that's where all the money's going let's
[29:25.360 --> 29:31.120]  see they tell the public oh he's like Robin Hood he's he takes the rich ladies

[35:35.840 --> 35:41.960]  people's houses and cars all over the world and the article says the police
[35:41.960 --> 35:45.440]  say it's because the people are angry that these are rich people let me give a
[35:45.440 --> 35:49.800]  newsflash to the young hooligans out there that are angry about the economy
[35:49.800 --> 35:56.000]  it's the bankers it's your god Obama the puppet your god Bush you need to
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.880]  understand that I guarantee the people torching cars most of them love Obama
[35:59.880 --> 36:03.520]  you know they think he's robbing the rich to pay the poor and let me explain
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.040]  something it says they're torching things like $35,000 BMWs that's not the
[36:09.040 --> 36:15.880]  elite that's the person that comes in the restaurant you work at and eats but
[36:15.880 --> 36:19.160]  this is class warfare this is what the elites are setting up the big elite
[36:19.160 --> 36:24.840]  banks always in other nations they bring down play the working class off
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.760]  against the middle class because the working class thinks that if somebody
[36:28.760 --> 36:35.600]  has shiny rims they're rich or if someone has bling they're rich let me tell
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.520]  you the real wealthy people hide their wealth and live offshore outside this
[36:41.520 --> 36:48.040]  nation they live on private islands so we'll get into that and a bunch of other
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.760]  really important news we've got Bob Chapman coming up in about 25 minutes
[36:53.760 --> 37:00.280]  then we've got Janine Roberts about the false scarcity artificial scarcity
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.640]  diamond trade and then the Barbara Lofisher on the whole vaccine autism
[37:04.640 --> 37:08.960]  situation that the media is trying to twist and spin and lie about but right
[37:08.960 --> 37:15.520]  now for the balance of this segment I wanted to get Steve shank on today
[37:15.520 --> 37:19.480]  because Steve shank has been the storeable foods business for 28 years
[37:19.480 --> 37:22.920]  I bought a lot of storeable foods over the years and didn't like a lot of the
[37:22.920 --> 37:27.600]  quality of it I'll tell you and when I bought his food seven years ago it
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.680]  didn't have any MSG it was non GMO it was the best price I found out there and
[37:32.680 --> 37:37.600]  delivered the quickest just in a few weeks and so we went out and got him as a
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.760]  sponsor but I wanted to have him on to track what's happening in the economy
[37:41.760 --> 37:47.640]  and what's happening in food cost for him Steve shank thanks for coming on
[37:47.640 --> 37:54.560]  with us hey it's great to be aboard Alex you know you talk about tracking what's
[37:54.560 --> 38:01.080]  going on I'm sure that you picked up on this but any of the states now we've
[38:01.080 --> 38:08.120]  got a really strong movement for state sovereignty but the states that buy into
[38:08.120 --> 38:12.800]  the bailout the governors of those states I don't know if your your listeners
[38:12.800 --> 38:20.080]  realize this they get a they get a flush fund the governor of Utah got an 87
[38:20.080 --> 38:25.000]  million dollar flush fund it's a payoff yeah they're they're they're they're
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.840]  buying the governors and a couple of things of course your listeners will be
[38:30.840 --> 38:36.080]  glad to hear that their their money is going to be spent to to pay the rent
[38:36.080 --> 38:39.800]  for for some of the folks that can't pay theirs which I'm sure everybody's
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.400]  delighted that the at the struggling to pay their own house payments and and
[38:44.400 --> 38:48.560]  helping to pay everybody else's to that's wonderful hey Robert Reich Robert
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.640]  Reich said literally as we you know we made the comment that the highway funds
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.840]  will really only help illegal aliens in the big highway contracting companies
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.040]  the rich guys illegal aliens and then the Obama administration official came out
[39:00.040 --> 39:03.800]  and said yeah we don't want this money going to white males construction
[39:03.800 --> 39:08.960]  workers now and that's something well the real kicker for me was that the
[39:08.960 --> 39:15.800]  15 million of the Utah a flush fund is to go to Hollywood to encourage them to
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.400]  come and make films in Utah but you know be that as it may are you kidding the
[39:21.400 --> 39:25.880]  Hollywood payoff is in the over 40 million bucks but your rights a lot of
[39:25.880 --> 39:31.200]  you know it's just in the millions in your state yeah I understand one of the
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.040]  things that we need to watch very carefully as the increase in food stamps
[39:35.040 --> 39:41.640]  is just absolutely horrendous which means a lot of good people are out of work
[39:41.640 --> 39:46.200]  and they're not making money but one of the concerns that that we're we're
[39:46.200 --> 39:53.280]  working we're actually looking at is that the way things are operating those
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.440]  of us who are paying the bills and still can pay our bills have to wonder when
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.400]  the food shortages occur and I've got a food shortage that we need to really
[40:02.400 --> 40:09.000]  address real quickly but when those food shortages occur when someone stands in
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.200]  line as some of your listeners that have been able to be prudent and and put
[40:13.200 --> 40:17.840]  away you know the funds and and be able to take care of themselves when they
[40:17.840 --> 40:21.600]  stand in line at the grocery store with cash and they're standing next to
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.800]  somebody with food stamps the way that things are going with this particular
[40:25.800 --> 40:31.080]  administration is it possible that someone with food stamps would be given
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.960]  priority to have the food if there's not enough for both let me say this you
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.880]  know it's not even food stamps anymore it's a federal ID that has credits put
[40:39.880 --> 40:42.640]  on and they're saying that they're gonna end up just putting most Americans on
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.480]  this and it's already at all time record people getting food aid absolutely
[40:48.480 --> 40:52.400]  now one of the things that your listeners need to be aware of is when
[40:52.400 --> 40:55.880]  we're buying out in front when the warehouse is buying out in front of all
[40:55.880 --> 41:01.000]  this food that is being shipped out to folks one of the issues that has come
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  up in the last two weeks is potatoes whether they're dices slices or or or
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.840]  mashed potatoes right now the dried potatoes are sold out by most suppliers
[41:12.840 --> 41:20.240]  through all of next year they are taking no more no more orders through all of
[41:20.240 --> 41:24.680]  next well let me stop you there Steve because a year ago on this show you said
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.800]  that there would be food shortages in 2009 now every day on TV's a big New
[41:29.800 --> 41:34.520]  Brzezinski on MSNBC we played the clip last week world leaders Gordon Brown and
[41:34.520 --> 41:37.520]  I don't know if this is gonna happen I don't know if you're right I hope you're
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.520]  wrong but you've been right all along they're saying we're going to have food
[41:41.520 --> 41:45.520]  riots and riots in the United States soon there's already riots and three
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.440]  governments have fallen in Europe over food because people are starving and the
[41:50.440 --> 41:56.240]  governments can't even issue them the food cards so Mexico is collapsing
[41:56.240 --> 42:00.880]  martial law has been declared on the Texas Mexico border this is mainstream
[42:00.880 --> 42:07.320]  news so we're not trying to scare people folks are insane if they don't have
[42:07.320 --> 42:12.320]  food water filters and guns and a willingness to defend themselves well
[42:12.320 --> 42:18.680]  and there are three little issues that I really need to point out as you know
[42:18.680 --> 42:25.720]  Alex so we've got a can of seeds up on the up on the Internet for 39.95 and
[42:25.720 --> 42:31.560]  it's got 23,000 seeds in it and it's it's superior to anything else that's
[42:31.560 --> 42:37.600]  out there one of the things that people are mistaken about is they're being
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.200]  told hey put in a food supply and it's the in the form of seeds if you got a
[42:42.200 --> 42:46.000]  wait for a garden to grow for your food you're going to get awful dadgum
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.040]  hungry no you need both of us and more than if anybody's paying more than 40
[42:50.040 --> 42:55.200]  bucks for a for a garden in a can they are just absolutely being ripped off
[42:55.200 --> 43:00.600]  and it's absolute misdirection basically what people have to do is get real
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.320]  food whether they get them from e-foods direct or wherever they get well you need
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.880]  both I mean I've told people they need to get even if it's five acres in the
[43:07.880 --> 43:12.160]  country somewhere if they have to stay in the city and work they need you know if
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.080]  you've got the money an RV the point is put in a garden now learn how to do it
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.360]  now but have the storeable food so that while you get self-sufficient you have
[43:20.360 --> 43:25.680]  both you've got to have both you've got to have backup absolutely I mean you
[43:25.680 --> 43:30.240]  can't buy enough food to last for 10 years the fact is that you've got to
[43:30.240 --> 43:34.240]  you've got to become self-reliant one of the things that I needed to point out
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.160]  these little three-day packs that that we started sending out Alex yes they're
[43:39.160 --> 43:42.400]  going out literally by the thousands but what people aren't doing is that
[43:42.400 --> 43:45.600]  they're not opening them up and what we did was we put some goodies in there
[43:45.600 --> 43:49.320]  with some free samples from to give their neighbors and we also put a coupon
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.160]  is that if they buy other purchases they they have a discount on though yeah the
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.240]  three-day first responder the three-day responder for 2195 folks that is three
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.320]  days of food and it's really a sample of what the J. Michael Stevens group and
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.280]  eatfoodsdirect.com offers see to open it up eat it try it out see how good the
[44:09.280 --> 44:15.400]  storeable food is and also use the coupon folks yeah absolutely the main
[44:15.400 --> 44:21.960]  thing right now Alex is that things are falling apart so quickly that those
[44:21.960 --> 44:29.000]  people that have ears to hear and eyes to see must become self-reliant I think
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.960]  it's been proven that every step that they're taking with this bailout money
[44:33.960 --> 44:41.680]  every step is they're taking is meant to control people and the more control that
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.120]  they have this this national ID card they're telling the states they're
[44:46.120 --> 44:50.880]  telling the states that well go ahead and issue your own cards but anything
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.360]  that's considerable can control by the feds which is all food all
[44:55.360 --> 45:00.600]  transportation all all of everything basically in your ranking flying to
[45:00.600 --> 45:04.480]  college you're good you're gonna have to have that it's already a world ID card
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.960]  through the feds now I want to just back you up on something folks can Google
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.440]  this it was a major university study came out three months ago seven million
[45:13.440 --> 45:17.440]  starved to death during great depression that's the headline you can pull up the
[45:17.440 --> 45:21.960]  actual study it's a group of studies now that was when 90% of people were
[45:21.960 --> 45:27.640]  supposedly self-sufficient in the country now we're 90% urban and the 10% on the
[45:27.640 --> 45:31.680]  country only half of them are self-sufficient so five percent of the
[45:31.680 --> 45:37.120]  public self-sufficient versus 90% that were that were self-sufficient during the
[45:37.120 --> 45:40.760]  great depression that lasted a decade ladies and gentlemen I'm telling you
[45:40.760 --> 45:46.720]  right now you know we you know we hope for the best plan for the worst here I
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.160]  don't know how to say it I only promote what I believe in and I believe in
[45:51.160 --> 45:55.000]  getting trouble foods and I believe in the trusted source there's a lot of talk
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.400]  out there but I give you my word the J. Michael Stevens group they are not fly
[45:59.400 --> 46:04.040]  by night they are the folks to go with they are the high-quality food and I
[46:04.040 --> 46:08.920]  want you to give them a call see before around a time please now have folks you
[46:08.920 --> 46:11.800]  know give them the number give them the website tell them some of the food
[46:11.800 --> 46:19.000]  packages you've got okay the website is efoodsdirect.com that's the letter e
[46:19.000 --> 46:27.880]  f-o-o-d-s-d-i-r-e-c-t.com and the phone number is 800-409-5633
[46:27.880 --> 46:35.400]  800-409-5633 the seed pack obviously anything more than 40 bucks for a seed
[46:35.400 --> 46:43.480]  pack you it's just absolutely insane three day the three-day responder pack is
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.880]  it's really cool but you got to open the little thing and get your coupon out and
[46:47.880 --> 46:52.760]  also the free samples to give your friends so that they get food too and of
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.000]  course the two-month grab-and-go which is just absolutely it's all prepared stuff
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.160]  you had water and heat it and this is what a lot of families alex are are
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.880]  using for their backup to throw in their car if they have to get out of dodge
[47:05.880 --> 47:10.120]  they're putting it in hunting camps all sorts of things and then of course the
[47:10.120 --> 47:15.320]  standard the one-year supplies that people put in multiples and the average
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.280]  right now most of the christian community out there is thinking at least
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.800]  three years worth of food just based on the scriptures and and that's supported
[47:23.800 --> 47:28.000]  by what's happened in other countries too but very simply alex I just
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.920]  appreciate the your support of of getting people fed the only way that
[47:32.920 --> 47:37.400]  people can be fearless in these very fearless fearful times is to be
[47:37.400 --> 47:41.360]  independent and very simply all the money that's coming out from the
[47:41.360 --> 47:45.800]  government does not create independence it creates dependency and you will pay
[47:45.800 --> 47:51.920]  if you take if you take a drink at the federal trough yes and when we read the
[47:51.920 --> 47:57.040]  IMF and World Bank documents they brag how they brought down hundreds of third
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.920]  world countries and Western nations and they're doing it now it's the IMF World
[48:00.920 --> 48:05.760]  Bank documents just Google that Greg Palace BBC he broke this in late 2001
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.680]  early 2002 I put it in my book to send to tyranny you have to understand this is
[48:10.680 --> 48:15.480]  by design and everything is meant to make things worse they call it the IMF
[48:15.480 --> 48:20.760]  fire sale that comes after the IMF riot they they cause an economic situation
[48:20.760 --> 48:25.280]  the cause was riots like Argentina just look at that in 99 2000 they went from
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.800]  being first world as wealthy as the US per capita to Ted Anderson was just down
[48:29.800 --> 48:35.800]  there a few months ago on his honeymoon and it was just absolutely he said
[48:35.800 --> 48:38.960]  families and their and their Western folks they look just like Americans most
[48:38.960 --> 48:41.480]  of them down there you know we have the image of brown people live in the
[48:41.480 --> 48:45.120]  street and it's terrible but he said it was just white families you know good
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.160]  looking families good-looking black families you know Hispanic white just
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.240]  living everywhere smog everywhere starving you know children ought to get
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.560]  Ted on to talk about that this is what the bastard bankers did and two weeks
[48:57.560 --> 49:02.600]  after the bankers collapsed Argentina the Washington Post reported a cattle
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.160]  trailer with cattle topped over there were dead cattle on the road and middle
[49:06.160 --> 49:10.320]  class families it described them we're sitting there with knives cutting off
[49:10.320 --> 49:16.120]  globulets of beef gobbling raw beef I mean like like animals that happens
[49:16.120 --> 49:21.040]  within a week and a half to two weeks the Pentagon study show maximum of 15
[49:21.040 --> 49:26.640]  days people turn into raving lunatics and all the new taxes all the new
[49:26.640 --> 49:31.600]  regulations is meant to fully bankrupt this country so you've got to go to the
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.080]  government with handouts to live in their control grid give them the number
[49:35.080 --> 49:42.240]  so people don't have to be dependent Steve Shane 800 409 5 6 3 3 that's 800

[54:22.200 --> 54:29.680]  and infowars.com yeah there might still be time folks if we can identify the
[54:29.680 --> 54:33.800]  criminals which we've done educate the public about who they are take back
[54:33.800 --> 54:37.240]  control of our states then the federal government and arrest the heads of the
[54:37.240 --> 54:41.040]  Federal Reserve and the New World Order we can do it you know I've got a video
[54:41.040 --> 54:45.480]  clip that's up on prisonplanet.com Steve Watson wrote it for infowars.net
[54:45.480 --> 54:49.360]  CNBC anchors mortified that Ron Paul is allowed airtime we're gonna play part of
[54:49.360 --> 54:55.080]  that clip next hour and Ron Paul gets a little more aggressive with Bernanke and
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.440]  just says look you can't pop up the bubble you know your Federal Reserve I
[54:58.440 --> 55:01.240]  wish you'd come right out and say engineered all this but he goes after
[55:01.240 --> 55:04.880]  him in the banking committee Bernanke looks upset and they cut to the sick of
[55:04.880 --> 55:11.440]  fans on CNBC and they're just like hell dare him this is not going as planned
[55:11.440 --> 55:15.680]  and no it's not and they get mad and say we were supposed to cut to a feed of
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.240]  Bernanke in his opening statement we only want to hear from him we don't want
[55:19.240 --> 55:26.160]  to hear from these congressmen they just want to grandstand yeah how dare how
[55:26.160 --> 55:33.240]  dare the Congress people elected by the population get angry at the private
[55:33.240 --> 55:39.960]  bankers that did all this how how dare whoever at CNBC that cut to live Ron
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.760]  Paul questions and see I've always pointed out back when I had time before
[55:43.760 --> 55:46.280]  I was making the Obama deception I get on the treadmill or stair-step or in the
[55:46.280 --> 55:49.960]  garage for about an hour in the morning and so I'd watch c-span hearings that
[55:49.960 --> 55:53.320]  were live in the morning and I'd see Ron Paul everybody else tearing them up and
[55:53.320 --> 55:56.360]  bringing up the New World Order and everything and the bankers you know on
[55:56.360 --> 56:03.480]  the hot spot and on the hot seat on and on and on it but then I turn over to CNBC
[56:03.480 --> 56:09.000]  they would only cut to the feeds on Fox and CNBC and seeing in when Bernanke or
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.520]  Paulson or Geithner and all these guys are up there putting out their lies they
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.000]  never show what the congressman do oh but the the anchors freak out when Ron
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.800]  Paul actually made it on TV
[56:27.440 --> 56:34.920]  so this is the type of stuff we're dealing with here ladies and gentlemen
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.280]  I'm gonna get into this later in more detail but there's more lies you know
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.520]  Obama is saying hey we want marijuana to be under the same laws that
[56:44.520 --> 56:47.600]  prescription drugs are and if you see what the feds are doing they're moving
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.320]  away from saying marijuana is basically bad and we want to rate everybody who
[56:52.320 --> 56:56.400]  has it too if we catch you with it without a prescription we're gonna give
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.680]  you the type of charge like you had hydrocodone or or codeine or morphine or
[57:01.680 --> 57:08.320]  something and so in a press conference the gun banning attorney general Eric
[57:08.320 --> 57:12.760]  Holder was asked about this it's in the San Francisco Chronicle today and he
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.000]  long and said the reporters were saying we thought you were gonna change
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.720]  federal marijuana policy and let the states you know have their say and the
[57:19.720 --> 57:23.320]  headline is us to yield a marijuana jurisdiction to states and he says well
[57:23.320 --> 57:26.720]  we haven't had it because they've stepped up raids on medical marijuana
[57:26.720 --> 57:34.760]  dispensaries and he said well give us time you know we're looking at only you
[57:34.760 --> 57:38.440]  know dealing with it like it's a prescription drug well all the time
[57:38.440 --> 57:41.800]  people get pulled over about the prescription drugs even with with the
[57:41.800 --> 57:47.880]  prescription in a little pill case and the police take them to jail so no we
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.840]  need complete decriminalization of marijuana and the country is going to
[57:52.840 --> 58:01.760]  collapse completely totally if we don't in this drug war look the Mexican
[58:01.760 --> 58:05.080]  government admits their drug war is making the country collapse if you
[58:05.080 --> 58:10.680]  decriminalize narcotics every study shows in Europe's done it drug use goes
[58:10.680 --> 58:19.240]  way down and the criminals don't have this lucrative business okay it is
[58:19.240 --> 58:23.920]  pathetic and sad to use cocaine or heroin it's pathetic and sad to use
[58:23.920 --> 58:28.400]  ecstasy you don't want to lock people up for it because when you do that it
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.280]  makes it be a black market and have incredible value and then it brings more
[58:32.280 --> 58:36.840]  of the drugs into your community because it's so profitable it's very simple
[58:36.840 --> 58:53.560]  we'll be right back hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long
[58:53.560 --> 58:56.400]  time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more

[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.520]  break down the huge developments in the markets right now city banks shares are
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:48.920]  down by 36% and plunging as we speak clearly done by design by the central
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:52.960]  banks even mainstream media admits that by badmouthing and talking about
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:57.640]  nationalizing it's driving down Bank of America and Citibank the private
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:02.000]  Federal Reserve is using the government envelope or glove and calling it
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:07.160]  nationalization it's really financial domination financial hijacking we'll get
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.280]  into that we'll get into all the latest economic numbers that just came out
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:16.240]  today like a record plunge in the overall economy of 26% we'll break all
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:19.960]  that down with bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com right
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:25.280]  now bob thank you for joining us well you're welcome and it's very nice to be
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:30.120]  here let's get right into it what you think is most important happening in the
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:35.480]  economy right now well the episode that you just talked about which was is
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:42.560]  ongoing city group and its vaccinations the reason they don't want
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:52.400]  nationalization is that in nationalization the people who own stock in
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:59.520]  the company lose out in totality that's number one number two the bondholders
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:04.600]  get wiped out or they get a piece of what's left but they may not be much
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:10.040]  left number three it exposes the tremendous amount of derivatives that
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:16.800]  city group is involved in it kills all of the bonuses all of these extra golden
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:22.200]  parachutes and all those kinds of things that the management has so rather than do
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:28.160]  that nationalize they privatize as you brought out in the program before and
[1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:33.360]  it's a consolidation of the major banks who make up a good part of the business
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:41.280]  in the United States and in privatizing they're able to better control the
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:48.320]  movement of finance in the United States and so these are the main things and
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:56.160]  of course unfortunately for the shareholders it's it's been a an
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:06.000]  absolute nosedive and they've just well we went short the stock we bet it was
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:12.880]  going to go down at $38 a share $42 a share somewhere up there I kind of get
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:17.820]  it mixed up with JP Morgan because we shorted that as well around the same
[1:03:17.820 --> 1:03:23.560]  price and that's selling for around 20 but as you pointed out the city group
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:28.520]  is down 56 cents today it's selling for about a buck and a half and we'll
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:32.720]  probably cover that short not aware where it's buying in at somewhere around a
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:42.760]  dollar I hope and the subscribers will have made the difference between say
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:50.080]  $40 and $1 which is an awful lot of money well you're absolutely right Bob
[1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:54.160]  specifically let's start going over after the break we have a long segment
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:00.160]  the economic numbers the economy they're reporting is contracting at a record
[1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:07.880]  pace right now and I want to break down China saying they may not continue to
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:13.320]  buy as much of the T bills and where you see the globalist how you know week to
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:16.640]  week so much happens now it's like a year has passed in what would normally
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:22.880]  transpire in financial times and then I also want to early on go to phone calls
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:28.320]  for listeners specifically that have questions for you about the market and
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:35.120]  then we'll talk about gold up above a thousand then down to you know below 950
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.960]  now racing back up you predicted it would race up above a thousand then go
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:42.920]  back down and then find its bottom and then go go up way past a thousand a
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:46.320]  month ago so we'll see what your predictions are for where it's going to
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:51.160]  be going now and the new numbers that it's going to be testing Bob Chapman is

[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:09.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:16.480]  all right back live at prison wanted on tv bob chappan the international
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:22.040]  forecaster how are things going for the globalist in their worldwide
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:25.680]  consolidation they're all over the news again this week saying world
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:29.680]  governments the answer world banking obama has announced his carbon taxes
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:34.080]  they now got a flotilla of mainstream news articles you can just google put a
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:38.600]  carbon tax on children that's really the one-child policy they're racing ahead
[1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:42.640]  now obama's announcing scores of new taxes not just people making a hundred
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:45.960]  twenty five thousand dollars individually or two hundred fifty thousand
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:50.560]  together as couples they're announcing so let's talk about the taxes the globalist
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:56.560]  agenda the economy rapidly contracting i mean the the economist know and admit
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:00.520]  that slashing taxes will get the economy going clearly by increasing them they
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:06.000]  know that this is meant to stall things further so they can consolidate
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.600]  i think you're right uh... particularly on the taxation issue of course the
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:14.760]  company the money that they've been spending is out trucker atrocious
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:18.640]  uh... even the uh... the obama administration about said that they
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:21.800]  we're going to have a deficit of one point seven five
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.280]  uh... trillion dollars
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:27.520]  and there's other estimates that are close to two trillion
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:31.840]  and so you know we've been right on our on our guest estimates actually are
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:34.120]  started at one point three
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:38.840]  and we get into a deeper meaning it's like going through a garbage dump
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:40.080]  and uh...
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:42.560]  it just keeps on getting worse
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:44.160]  but anyway uh...
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.080]  what's going on in the market here is great indecision because
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:51.960]  uh... i i i don't think wall street
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:54.100]  and professional investors
[1:09:54.100 --> 1:09:55.560]  quite envisioned
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:59.280]  and the changes that are taking place to be the kind of changes
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:02.280]  uh... that were uh... they anticipated
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:04.440]  and so they didn't happen
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:06.240]  worse things did
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:07.640]  you know higher taxes
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:10.400]  particularly if they put taxes on
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:14.440]  uh... share transactions which they've talked about as well
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:16.560]  is it not very good
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:19.400]  uh... for wall street of the earnings
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:22.960]  i got a prop probably come in on the s and p five hundred about
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:25.640]  about uh... twenty eight dollars
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.080]  and uh... that would reflect uh... into
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:32.800]  uh... the doubt selling uh... dot jones industrial selling it
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:34.680]  around six thousand
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:39.280]  so i'm looking at six thousand sixty six hundred somewhere down in there
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:42.880]  and uh... the market has no real strength
[1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:44.320]  every time it tries to
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:46.000]  uh... put a rally on it
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.640]  uh... cut short
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:49.800]  the same thing happened again today
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:51.720]  and it's in progress
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.120]  uh... as far as the uh... gold is concerned
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:57.040]  uh... we've had a very quick
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:58.720]  the correction this week
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:01.400]  it's one down through the nine thirty area
[1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:03.680]  uh... which was about a seventy dollar
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:05.920]  uh... adjustment over four days
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:08.800]  and actually you know for you people who
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:11.680]  haven't been in the market for years like i have
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:14.920]  when you have adjustments like that in the quick like that
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:16.560]  they're very very good
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.880]  now i know what i just want isn't good
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:23.280]  but if you're gonna have one that's the best kind to have what happens quick
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:26.640]  and it happened quick the question is is this the bottom
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:29.720]  uh... it could be nine hundred uh... it could be here
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:31.800]  uh... don't know for sure
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:35.480]  and it'll turn around and go right back up again and test a thousand
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:36.280]  uh...
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:39.320]  mmm i think it should happen immediately
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:40.680]  or fairly quickly
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:43.560]  if it doesn't it'll certainly happen by the fall
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:46.440]  and so uh... gold is going to break out
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:49.160]  and the insiders know that
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:52.080]  uh... they're just trying to delay it as long as possible
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:54.920]  just like they are the trying to delay
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:56.200]  what's going on
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.840]  uh... in the market in the economy
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:01.680]  and in finance in the figure they came up with this morning
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:04.480]  about gdp falling in the fourth quarter
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:05.720]  uh...
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.480]  what was it six point three percent
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.760]  the figures are even worse than that
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:12.720]  i mean you know that they never tell the truth other saying biggest drop in
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.480]  twenty six years
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:15.840]  yes that's correct
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:19.480]  and you know that's going to continue with any get worse now
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:22.120]  uh... the feeding of the monies
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.440]  that are coming from the stimulus package
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:28.280]  i'm not really going to make a great deal of difference this year
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.880]  it'll help a little
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.760]  and that's going to cause the
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:34.520]  depending upon whose ratings you look at
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:36.840]  uh... on mister obama
[1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.040]  uh... one of the sixty four the other fifty four
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:41.720]  uh... he's going to be down
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:45.840]  uh... by september october around forty to thirty five
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:48.360]  because people are going to realize that this program
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:52.160]  it's just not going to work that way you see them staging a terror attack
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:56.040]  around that time to try to rally support around the messianic leader i mean i
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:58.360]  don't see them getting their agenda through
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:03.040]  without them staging a terror attack releasing a bio weapon to poses saviors
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:05.840]  or launching a new war
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.000]  all is certainly certainly very possible
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.840]  uh... the problem is the timing is so difficult
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:13.480]  because the
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:15.720]  you know thirty five or forty
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:18.280]  uh... as a approval rating
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.920]  really isn't bad it's not good but it's not bad
[1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:24.480]  and i don't know that they would
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:25.800]  create a
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:28.000]  uh... false flag operation
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.880]  based upon that
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:32.920]  uh... are you know the most of the money
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:34.600]  that's in that package
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:36.880]  is going to be coming out next year
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.640]  so next year
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.440]  could be a
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:42.640]  holding hiatus point
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:44.600]  and maybe a little bit better
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:46.360]  in this year
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:48.280]  and the reason for that
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:50.560]  the reason i packed it that way
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:53.680]  is because of the the congressional election next year
[1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:56.960]  in all these people who are democrats want to get reelected
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:59.480]  so you know this is why people think
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.360]  things are going to happen quickly
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:05.280]  and there's so many things you have to factor into this thing
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:07.800]  and these people have the ability
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:09.200]  through congress
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:13.280]  to do stimulus packages in fact i think they'll have another one next january
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:16.800]  probably for two trillion dollars well obama's already saying another banker
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:19.800]  bailout which will be the one that sets up the new global
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:23.000]  new deal the new global bank i was going to help you
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.040]  globally
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:26.240]  with u.s. taxpayer money
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:30.000]  bob uh... you know a few weeks ago you said what you were revising your
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:30.960]  forecast event
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:34.120]  from complete depression within two and a half years to a year and a half
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:36.480]  are you are are you sure
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:39.160]  like revising back to a more long-term
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:40.200]  till we're
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:42.760]  in a mad max scenario or
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:46.960]  what are you getting out we have we have depression already started
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:50.640]  and uh... we having a slight hiatus
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:55.040]  in uh... inflation in the united states are running around nine percent
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:59.560]  m three is running around eleven and and and but i have to twelve percent
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:02.120]  down from where it was before
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:03.240]  as big
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.480]  tarp funds and other funds from stimulus
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:08.840]  hit the market and the
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:12.560]  the responsibility of treasury to raise two trillion dollars which they'll have
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:14.120]  to monetize
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.640]  that's going to be in hitting probably in april maybe may be march
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:21.200]  and that's going to call very quickly
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:24.160]  but push inflation up
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.920]  that will extend
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:27.200]  inflation
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:29.040]  extends
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:30.680]  the end line
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:34.080]  for deflation
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:38.040]  that's why you can't easily predict what's going on
[1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:40.480]  we're going to have an inflationary depression
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:42.040]  for a time
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:43.600]  two years
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  maybe three maybe year and a half i don't know yet
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:48.500]  but let's stop right there
[1:15:48.500 --> 1:15:51.120]  let's talk about the credit card bubble
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:54.480]  the college bubble people that have paid for these hundred thousand dollar
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:56.040]  college educations
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:59.280]  they're getting out every year they can't find jobs
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:03.360]  uh... they're accelerating off-shoring of u.s jobs accelerating being bringing
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:04.800]  in the skilled visas
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:08.320]  replace jobs everybody i know in austin that worked at ibm to greed
[1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:12.080]  engineers and i know four people have all lost their jobs completely to train
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:13.320]  their end in replacements
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:16.840]  we're working for a third of it and uh... you know now they're gone
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:18.200]  they're on the streets
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:21.880]  uh... you have all these state pension funds on the verge of bankruptcy
[1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:23.560]  are going into bankruptcy
[1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:26.200]  you have all these unfunded mandates where they give you twenty thirty percent
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:27.200]  of the money
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:30.680]  in the federal bailout in the states that are with seventy percent more
[1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:34.720]  uh... restaurant i had been to about a year that i uh... every time i went to
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:37.480]  in the past was jam packed full on a thursday night
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:40.960]  couple there were one other group of people in their eating dinner
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:45.000]  uh... restaurants you know that have always been your really busy are in
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.540]  and austin supposedly
[1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:47.640]  a good economy
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:50.920]  i mean this is already bad what we're under i mean how about how bad are you
[1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:52.720]  saying it's going to get
[1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:55.240]  uh... over thirty percent unemployment
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:58.640]  incidentally ibm just uh... is in the process
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:01.600]  of building a major complex uh...
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:04.160]  south of guadalajara in mexico
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:09.240]  and they intend to move everything out of the united states and that's why
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:12.640]  the only answer to this problem
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:16.800]  free trade globalization offsuring and and outsourcing
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:19.440]  very simply is tariffs
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.640]  and if america does not have tariffs
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:24.560]  will end up with forty or fifty percent unemployment
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:27.320]  and for those that don't know no way we can compete
[1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:30.200]  and for those that don't know china has a built-in tariff with their low
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:31.160]  currency
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:35.120]  and no environmental standards of slave wages that is basically
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:39.880]  in its overall economic effect a huge tariff so we hear free trade this is
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:42.840]  not for your fair trade is it bob
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:44.480]  it certainly isn't
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:50.400]  and uh... it is just absolutely propaganda that's been misrepresented
[1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:52.720]  and uh... sadly
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:55.640]  the only newsletter writer i know of
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:17:58.040]  talking outside the box
[1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:00.200]  who pushes it so hard
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:02.320]  the rest of them just don't get it
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:04.000]  now you gotta watch a move on
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.480]  they'll they'll pass a tariff the day they finally take stock market down to
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:11.320]  nothing and say the tariff did it you know the tricks they play
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:13.960]  that's what they didn't in the early thirties and
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:18.720]  uh... the uh... the depression was caused in that period of time
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:21.160]  by the fed withdrawing money for the system
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:24.160]  and met him when they turned around and put it back into the system wouldn't do
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:24.960]  any good
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:27.560]  and that's exactly what's happening today
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:29.360]  and you know they know
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:30.920]  that that's the way it works
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.000]  so you know it was delivered just like it is now
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:38.440]  well bob why you're hearing what you just mentioned alex
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:39.160]  about
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:42.880]  well we need a world government we need a world currency we need a world that the
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:45.000]  other thing
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.280]  that's the duty of the justification for that
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:49.680]  yeah it's perfect plan
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:53.280]  they globally create the crisis and say we need a global solution to a global
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:54.200]  crisis
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:57.040]  and then the very people that engineered this by design they will then be our
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:18:58.120]  saviors i mean
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:18:59.760]  it seems to me
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:03.400]  all we gotta do is tell the truth and get the story out about these how this is a
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:04.680]  pack of criminals
[1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:07.200]  larcenist criminals that destroyed our economy
[1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:08.320]  by design
[1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:10.120]  to build their new world order
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:11.480]  and that we should
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:14.680]  take the states back take the federal government back and arrest all these
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:15.480]  criminals
[1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:19.360]  i mean we can do that if we just start believing we can and get the word out
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:21.280]  about it

[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:33.200]  let's talk to Steve in New York Steve you're on the air with Bob Chapman
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:36.080]  hi hi I'm Steve
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:40.960]  how are you doing guys? Good. I'm a time listener. What I'm calling for today is
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:44.120]  actually I want to introduce myself I work at a
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:48.080]  well-known company that you guys are very familiar with
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:50.960]  and I've witnessed for myself
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:54.640]  you know I think it's about the trade
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:59.360]  deals not trade not free trade but trade deals that are made
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:05.160]  in different parts of the world and that's that have a big effect on
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:09.000]  someone like me who's a guy just trying to make a living
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.240]  I have a story to tell
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:14.720]  and I'm calling the show because I want to
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:20.280]  gain some trust in it and tell my story. Well it's about control
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:21.880]  it's about control
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:26.200]  and that's what globalism and trade is it's about wiping out trade in areas
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:29.720]  they want to consolidate building up trade in areas they control
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:33.680]  playing nations off against each other to bring in this world empire they use
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:34.720]  finance
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:38.080]  and military to control not just military but we have a lot of callers
[1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:41.760]  Steve and we've opened the phones up for calls for Bob Chapman on the economy
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:45.880]  but just give us a summation of your story
[1:25:45.880 --> 1:25:49.240]  well I really can't get in it on air it's going to get bigger
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:53.280]  and but what I can say is that
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:56.280]  what they're doing to the people
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:59.920]  native born people here to get rid of them
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:02.640]  is just as underhanded as can be
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:07.120]  yeah I mean the global is completely ruthless the public needs to figure that out
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:12.680]  and it is ruthless and it's it's really a violation of rights
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:17.560]  and liberty and I work in a company town
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:23.240]  and it's all control and I would like to get more details off air
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:26.600]  and and get into it a little more
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:29.880]  but I do have to proceed with caution at this point
[1:26:29.880 --> 1:26:34.440]  all right well then on air is not the place to do it Steve we appreciate your
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:34.920]  call
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:38.240]  you can send us an email or send Bob something we're just so busy
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:41.640]  we know about the corruption it's it's not a news flash to us we know they
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:45.040]  bring in foreigners order you to train them and then fire you
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.960]  and then you and then use the immigrants to do your job and
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:52.600]  people say well then well who will buy the products once there's no economy here
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:57.120]  the globalist them will shut that down it's that they use trade as a weapon
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:00.080]  to consolidate power they don't want a free market
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:03.520]  they don't want you independent Bob can you explain this to people
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:08.240]  well I do and you very succinctly just did so
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:13.000]  and it's the ripping of the heart of the American economy
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.920]  out and it just retching it from the
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:20.680]  the body of our country so that people can't get jobs
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:23.960]  and they don't care whether anybody buys anything
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:28.080]  because the end result is what they're looking for in the process they're
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:29.240]  making lots of money
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:33.640]  and especially for the transnational corporations who
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:37.320]  have subsidiaries that do this business outside the country
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:41.480]  in places like Cayman Islands and the Bahamas and so on
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:45.960]  and they're hiding their money offshore and as you know four years ago
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:49.960]  our Congress allowed them to bring back three hundred and fifty billion dollars
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:53.720]  at five and a quarter percent taxation instead of thirty three
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:57.520]  and now they want to do it again for five hundred and fifty billion
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:00.640]  now let's explain to folks because I've analyzed these cases but you're really an
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:02.240]  expert on this I want to get your response
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:05.920]  when we hear about them doing CBS news pieces about the Cayman Islands
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:09.040]  and how two hundred and something million the bailout money went to the
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:10.000]  Caymans alone
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.640]  they're just getting everybody mad so they can shut down small tax shelters
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:18.520]  because that became retail and the public started using the loopholes
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:22.680]  the banks had written for themselves just like most the White House doesn't pay
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:24.760]  taxes most the Congress doesn't pay taxes
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:28.000]  more and more of it comes out they have one set of rules
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.680]  and then we have another set of rules that we live under
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:35.240]  and if you look at it most multinational corporations pay less than one percent
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:35.840]  tax
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:39.720]  that's right and that's part of the way that they do that
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:43.480]  and of course that embellishes the
[1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:47.560]  the want of these international corporations to do such things because in
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:48.760]  the process they get
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:50.520]  richer and more powerful
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:52.320]  and of course at the same time
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:55.320]  they destructed the district destroy the infrastructure
[1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:57.080]  of not all the united states
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.560]  but mexico canada in europe
[1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:02.440]  yeah i mean it's very simple those demonstrations over there
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:05.120]  are about money and income and jobs
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:07.920]  and they're getting worse and worse i had pitches
[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:11.960]  the people sent me this week of a major protest in granola
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:13.040]  and
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:17.560]  in this protest they were wearing jackabin outfits
[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:20.400]  and for those of you don't know the jackabins
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:21.520]  with the people
[1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:23.840]  during the revolution in france
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:25.480]  that went around and
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:27.680]  collected people so they could bring them
[1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:30.360]  to the guillotine to cut their heads off
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:34.880]  and so there's some serious stuff going on all over the world
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:36.600]  bob i want to talk about

[1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:04.800]  did you know that ph balance is one of the most important factors in
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:07.240]  maintaining high energy and vibrant health
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:10.880]  most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a ph level of
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:16.040]  nine or higher plasma ph drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline

[1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:16.400]  from my new film to drop in the info war and it is a mighty weapon it's a
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:21.480]  weapon that is self-replicating if you will make copies of it and spread it
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:28.360]  every one of these in the info war is like a rocket launcher you pop up at
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:33.080]  mines that have been seized by the enemy and you fire a red pill literally
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:38.040]  hits them blast through their programming because it's got the truth in it
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.400]  it goes around the left right propaganda paradigm it gets into the real
[1:33:42.400 --> 1:33:48.640]  information we need to picture these films as grenades that you just throw in
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:55.720]  to the zombie chambers boom and many of them will wake up just keep throwing
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:34:01.120]  grenades keep firing heat and at the same time you're not just unlocking mines
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:05.400]  picture the enemies info war tanks coming over blasting firing at the
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:09.200]  population and you're just up there with those rockets blasting and blowing them
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:14.200]  to bits hit them in the treads immobilize them and then just keep
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.520]  getting more of the film out go in throw a hanger and a down in the hatch
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:22.680]  boom literally ladies and gentlemen we are savaging them they have
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.680]  congressional hearings saying they want to shut us down for the violent
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:29.320]  radicalization act they list 9-11 truth courage they attack me and national
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:34.320]  publications but they know if they kill me it'll be like a hydrogen bomb going
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:37.800]  off and we'll just get the info going that much faster because the tree of
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:43.280]  liberty is watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants and I mentioned that
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:46.520]  because it's such a big point of you know discussion wise Alex Jones told
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:49.400]  alive when they've killed so many we got a lady coming up about 25 minutes who
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:52.520]  put out an international film about the diamond trade being a monopoly we're
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:55.880]  going to Brazil in a moment but I want Bob to comment on that and they came on
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:01.680]  her yacht you know she's a British lady and remember the aristocracy over there
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:03.960]  and they said you shouldn't have made that film and they broke her jaw and
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:07.520]  broke her nose and a bunch of other stuff I mean this is real but she didn't
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:11.720]  back off she still released the film but she's alive today that happened I don't
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:19.760]  know 15 years ago or more but the globalist or pirates think about New
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:24.720]  York City that was founded by Dutch but became the major pirate port they would
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:30.920]  come from all the way from you know Asia pirates that roved out there and
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:38.520]  around Africa and Latin America and the horn and they would bring their goods to
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:42.080]  safe haven pirate ports well what is Luxembourg what is the Cayman Islands
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.160]  what is the Bahamas what is Portugal what is Switzerland those are pirate
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:49.520]  ports and if you study skull and bones other globalist groups they made their
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:53.360]  money out of the opium trade in the British East Indian the Dutch East
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:57.920]  India Company and they founded it with that and they set up CIA exclusively in
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:04.080]  47 out of the OSS out of skull and bones just a British chapter here in the
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.920]  United States this is all history this is mainline history just not taught in
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:13.280]  schools and that's why they say little hymns and little prayers at skull and
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:18.400]  bones and when I was also gohemian Grove they had all these big banners and
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:23.000]  plaques to different famous pirates because they see themselves as pirates
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:26.640]  and they are setting up a global order where they're outside the nations they
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:32.160]  don't follow any laws they're exempt and they just destroy nations and come in
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:35.600]  and loot them and then bring the wealth offshore and finance destroying the next
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:39.960]  nation that's why big banks will just give billions of dollars of free weapon
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:44.240]  systems to a Latin American country to a rebel group to an African group to then
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:47.560]  wreck that country so that country has to fight them in the banks will find the
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:51.760]  terrorist the rebels and the government I was watching I haven't seen it yet a
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:56.040]  clip from the film the international and the guys explaining their own why do you
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:01.800]  think big banks fund rebels or or fund terror groups or fund other governments
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:04.440]  to have a war when they're not even making money on it because they make
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:10.640]  money on the destruction these are pirates and Bob Chapman I wanted to get
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:20.160]  your response to that sir I've never heard it more eloquently put but you
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:25.200]  certainly write about the drug trade and most of the major families in New
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:31.520]  England and along the eastern seaboard were involved with the British and that's
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:36.280]  the you know cabinets and the lodges and the Forbes and all of them and they
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:48.280]  were privatizing or carrying heroin opium from India over to China and they
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:54.280]  made vast fortunes this was in the early 1800s the Roosevelt's yes they were all
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:38:00.120]  involved all the big names and and that's how they in modern times they
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.960]  funded that they what they were doing but they did the same thing in the
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:08.200]  Middle East as well and you write about them financing both sides of almost
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:13.880]  every conflict because when it's over they step in and they finance the
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:18.800]  redevelopment and get even richer and more powerful and this is the game that
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:25.080]  they play over and over and over again yet today we have radio programs such as
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:29.760]  yours and the internet to tell the people what they're not being told in
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:34.040]  school or in the mainline media that this is what these people do for a
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:39.600]  living and you know if it kills 20 or 50 million people they don't care I mean
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:43.960]  they are pirates just to it's quite an example you just gave it's really
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:48.880]  excellent well that's what they say about themselves that I mean they they brag
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:52.840]  that that that there's swashbuckling pirates and it's a big joke on all of
[1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:59.080]  us I want to go to calls Bob I just briefly as this guest is coming up
[1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:03.840]  later can I mean it's public knowledge it's a public secret but most people
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.000]  don't know it you know a average guy will be getting married when he's 25 he's
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:13.320]  making 30 grand a year he'll buy a $10,000 diamond for his betrothed and
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:17.120]  she's got to have it and they don't know that diamonds are semi precious
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:21.680]  literally or crap they're just geographically only in certain areas so
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:24.760]  they can artificially control that and how in the last hundred fifty years they
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  sold this is the gem that everybody has to have is the diamond and it's another
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:37.800]  example of a total scam a total cartel absolutely there's enough diamonds in
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:43.520]  the world to bury it I mean they intrinsically they have little or no value
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:48.000]  and that value has been created by De Beers and others but particularly De
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.800]  Beers which is controlled indirectly by the royal family and they're the ones
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:58.760]  who who financed all of the projects in South Africa and they're the ones that
[1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:08.640]  used Madison have tactics especially during the after the turn of the 21st
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:21.600]  century in the early 1900s diamonds became a thing to have or to do and when
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:27.760]  Rhodes died everything he had was turned over to a trust which is controlled by
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:34.320]  the royal family so you know he did what he did when he did it and and all of
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.520]  that the wealth returned to the masters and he wrote that they were going to
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:41.280]  create a British Empire through international finance that would be
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:46.400]  behind the throne and again they geographically control the diamonds where
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:52.800]  they come from Australia Africa mainly a little bit in South America and because
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:55.600]  they geographically control that even with mercenaries who they brag they'll
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:58.880]  send into killing by the drugs to mine them then they call them blood diamonds
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:01.840]  anybody else that wants to dig them and not pay their cut and we've got a ban
[1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:05.760]  this through you know humanitarian auspices total fraud the same thing
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:09.680]  with drugs they make narcotics illegal so they can geographically control them
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:13.560]  to make hundreds of times what the drugs are really worth which then
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:17.480]  criminalizes everything and lets them take over that way I mean you know so
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:21.760]  they bring in the drugs they bring in the diamonds everything it's we're
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:24.840]  about to go to Jake in Brazil but just hung up Jake I wanted to hear from you
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:29.040]  in Brazil if you can get back in we'd love to hear from you but let's go ahead
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:34.120]  and talk to Kirk in Colorado Kirk you're on the air go ahead good day to both
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:41.360]  you man Alex I have agreed with you over the years on at least 95 percent of
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:50.560]  what you said and taught and I was curious though why you and your fill in
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:57.520]  Romero in the past month or two have been down on Israel and they're blaming
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:06.040]  Israel for breaking the peace treaty and I had like to know your exact thought
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:15.160]  of Israel and the Jews Kirk look we're here talking about economic issues you
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:20.200]  know I try not to get into this endless ongoing debate and I get attacked by
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:23.800]  those that say I'm too easy on Israel I got attacked by
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:27.640]  those that say I'm too hard on Israel you know Hillary Clinton who's a
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:32.200]  can always flip-flopping you know she's been criticizing Israel so now she's
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:37.360]  being you know being broiled in the media Israel is being used as a
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:41.880]  military outpost Benjamin Netanyahu who wants to attack Iran that is going to
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:45.840]  cause World War three every military expert we've talked to and geopolitical
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:53.040]  expert has said and so so you know I love this this is the dumb
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:59.160]  downess of the American people that if I am against what happened in Israel where
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:03.120]  they shut down the border crossings and started doing targeted killings which
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:07.480]  did break the peace treaty and then Hamas is shooting these tinker toy
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:12.160]  rockets over and then Israel goes in and levels and then now we've got to pay
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:15.960]  for someone you know hundreds of millions of dollars going there and rebuild it all
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:20.240]  that does is that in broil the entire Middle East and public opinion turns
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:24.200]  against the United States and Israel I'm saying I'm against what happened there
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:31.120]  and then that doesn't become I hate Jews okay it's totally separate it's
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:35.440]  completely separate and that's all I have to say on that issue I want to move on
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:45.640]  here let's talk to Vanessa in New York Vanessa you're on the air I appreciate
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:51.200]  you taking my call I have a question actually I don't know if you want to
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:55.840]  say it's based on the economic problem so I hate to get off subject hey it's fine
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.480]  nobody calls in about subjects on the show go ahead I heard this morning on
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:09.320]  another radio show that they're putting through bill HR 1105 talking about the
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:14.320]  RFID and the NAIS chip and I want to know what I can do or I can go to
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:19.040]  protest this just a lead or something like that okay well let me tell you I
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:23.520]  mean through through feet well this is economic because the big agribusiness
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:27.120]  wants to shut down family farms and ranches they've written the federal
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:31.760]  regulations that aren't law but through fiat or enforced his law at the state
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:36.920]  level to where small farms and ranches have to put a $15 $20 tag on a $5
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:42.000]  chicken bankruptcy or where you have to have your premises registered and then
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:47.440]  you waive your rights in that contract now only a few states pass it as law like
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:51.720]  Texas but then that got defeated in the courts but they still go ahead with it
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:56.520]  Bob do you want to comment on the national animal ID in the premises ID
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:45:02.280]  it's really out of my category I'm I know what you know generally speaking and
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:07.760]  that's it yeah so ma'am I mean people are fighting the animal ID premises ID
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:13.080]  everywhere and I would just Google in IS or you know animal ID premises ID in
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:16.400]  your state if you want to fight or there's national groups fighting we've
[1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:20.720]  had a lot of those groups here on the show I appreciate it and also I have a
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:30.800]  comment and CNBC's reaction to Ron Paul they said that they were going to come
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:34.200]  back when they were playing something more substandard and I just thought that
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:38.800]  was great they admitted that like I have the transcript here they said we're
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:45.280]  going to come back I mean actually have the texture I appreciate your call man
[1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:49.760]  let me go ahead and read it Hain says this is not going as planned no it is
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:53.760]  not this is when they cut away from Ron Paul we were told that there was a very
[1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:56.600]  limited number of opening statements and it seems to be getting out of control
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:46:02.280]  burn it here's what we forgot everybody is taking this live you know what that
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:07.560]  means why would they miss an opportunity for free air time Hains we're going to
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:11.240]  take a commercial break and get them out of the way so that when something
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:16.960]  really substandard he means substantial is happening we don't have to interrupt
[1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:20.840]  them so the image here is how dare these elected congressmen are supposedly
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:23.520]  over the Federal Reserve which they're not bring up the fact the Federal
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:27.560]  Reserve destroying America how dare them will cut back once Bernanke's up there
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:30.520]  because normally they don't show the congressman asking serious questions
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:36.080]  they only show the private bankers Bob Chapman comments we're carrying that
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:41.680]  piece from info wars in tomorrow's issue and so you'll be able to see it there as
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:47.840]  well as on Alex's site and I saw the live version and that's exactly the
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:52.840]  way it happened and I was surprised because they've admitted that they're
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:58.720]  managing the news well it's just all right out in the open let's go ahead and
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:07.360]  talk to Brent in Texas Brent you're on the air yeah hey guys thanks for all
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:10.720]  the information you put out it's really incredible I don't know how you can put
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:16.480]  out so much material insistently but I'm thankful that you do question was for
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:21.320]  Bob and I emailed you about this I'm glad I got through I'm very surprised
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:26.720]  thanks for taking call just for Bob today you're on the air sir yeah so
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:31.440]  Bob the question was I know you're familiar with with prectors Elliott
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:37.080]  waving out because you've commented on it on occasion in the newsletter but you
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:42.760]  know lately I think was the last week or so he came out and basically said in
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:48.360]  this grand with what he calls a grand supercycle bear market that he'd be
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  surprised if futures even existed after it's over he didn't give any kind of
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:58.680]  timeline because that's impossible but you know clearly it'd be devastating for
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:02.880]  the markets if you know a major futures exchange went went under but what do you
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:08.280]  think about the likelihood of that the prospect of that and if it was let me
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:14.360]  add let me add about a Comex the you know gold futures defaulting and you
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:22.240]  comment on both us first of all I'll answer Alex and possible and probable
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:28.440]  and the answer the original question and that is you know we can have physical
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:33.800]  markets we don't need futures and maybe we should revamp the whole futures
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.720]  system so that it can't be rigged by government and just like we should
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:47.040]  privatize the SEC and the CFTC so that they don't cooperate with the criminals
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:52.320]  in Washington and a Wall Street I mean the made-off affair and now we get the
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:58.640]  Stanford thing SEC knew about made-off seven or eight or nine years ago
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:02.320]  refused to do anything and they knew it was a scam and there's hundreds of
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:06.480]  people involved and with Stanford they were told to stand down by another
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:12.360]  government agency I mean what is this so referring back to the futures markets
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:17.040]  there's no control the only control is the United States government doing what
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:21.360]  they want to do to those markets by manipulating and rigging them and it's
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:25.840]  got to stop and if it doesn't stop people ain't gonna play the game anymore
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:29.720]  and the whole market will be physical and that's why you're having the run
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:35.120]  that you're having for the last 10 months on physical gold and silver coins
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:40.480]  and bullion by individuals all over the world but particularly in Europe and now
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:46.360]  it's starting in the United States and so we can do without futures exchanges
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:51.120]  all right if they're rigged I mean who wants a rig market absolutely well
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:54.280]  that's what the pirates want and then they sucker the people back into the
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:59.120]  market so they can screw them then in Oregon you're on the air go ahead I had
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:04.680]  I had two comments for you guys on one I actually I heard just on Russia's show
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:07.760]  right before I turn on your show he actually admitted that they're saying
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:11.320]  that there's gonna be a one-world government and a one-world currency
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:15.200]  but was he saying that if you're against it you're bad because before he did he
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.240]  said it didn't exist no he just said it on there he said I think he was
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:23.360]  referring to another piece that a news organization was putting out oh yeah it's
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:28.720]  in hundreds of means yeah he was he was just basically admitting it and saying
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:32.800]  that you know the liberals are gonna be behind all of it which he normally does
[1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:36.000]  stay there I want to hear more about this when we get back that's a big deal
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:42.640]  but I mean Russia spent 16 17 18 years telling people none of this existed when
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:47.880]  the guy's smart and knows all about it and I've been wondering the last few
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:52.120]  months how is he going to say it doesn't exist when the Wall Street Journal
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:57.000]  Fox News CNN the Times of London the New York Times are all saying world
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:00.800]  government's real the banks are gonna rule you but that it's good it's good
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:05.360]  this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back

[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:35.440]  unless you have something else that's coming up but I mean your comments on
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:39.840]  this to because I've actually had other people tell me in days past he's been
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:43.360]  admitting it I know a lot of mainline conservatives are admitting it is true
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:49.920]  but you know your take on them having to admit all this now well I think that
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:56.400]  it's part of their process process of exposure they're getting ready to pull
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:01.280]  the plug on the entire world economy they haven't even done that yet I mean
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:04.800]  what you're seeing going on here all these problems prelude really child's
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:10.280]  play it hasn't got bad yet yeah they're setting the table exactly and we're
[1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:15.240]  looking out to maybe three years still until they're ready and then all of a
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:19.740]  sudden the deflation will begin and and then all of a sudden everything will
[1:56:19.740 --> 1:56:25.600]  just go haywire and they're coming out in anticipation of this this is part of
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:31.440]  the propaganda and brainwashing to make people start to begin to think in terms
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:37.120]  that they are going to be saved by a one-world entity of some kind now I have
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.800]  another article doing and you pointed this out last week Alex was the
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:51.400]  propaganda by Soros and and one of those fellas on on Fox he came out and said
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:57:00.040]  the Bubba's are going to win back attack and and so you better be ready for it
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:04.760]  they're preparing people to try to go and do that so they can implement
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.240]  martial law you remember last week that was a bottom line well it's the same
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:12.560]  thing this is a big propaganda war that's going on and they're heating the
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:17.040]  people up that's right they want us to go away they want us to start blasting
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:21.440]  that is not what we want we want to politically point out they're the
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:26.240]  criminals take control the states and and educate the public that it's the
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:30.280]  globalists that did this and that set letting them set up this world bank will
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:37.920]  only hurt us worse any other comments ban in Oregon oh yeah I just I was gonna
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:43.280]  ask Bob Chapman about I have a actually it's my wife's 401k and I try rolling it
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:48.880]  over into a IRA money market account and her company says that we can't do
[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:53.520]  anything with a 401k until she either quits or gets fired or something like
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:57.480]  that is there anything else I could do I believe that's just a lie I with most
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:02.440]  401ks she can demand it be liquidated but some places have a clause a lot of
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:07.720]  companies have really already leveraged that money and spent it Bob they can do
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:13.800]  what they want to do and if she tries to move it or if she wants to liquidate it
[1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:18.360]  she's out the door and it's as simple as that and it can do that and I run to a
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:22.200]  lot of them like that and some of them you can borrow 90% some of them you can
[1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:27.960]  borrow 10% it varies from company to company and you know the same thing
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:31.800]  they're trying to pull also with people who are liquidating life and annuity
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:36.560]  policies because they don't think that the insurance companies will pay off
[1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:43.440]  alright Bob stay there I want to do five more minutes with you thank you for

[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:09.160]  forecaster at the international forecaster.com be sure and check that
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:15.280]  out Bob in closing here in the time we have left with you the pension funds
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:18.720]  they're already writing the pension funds but the stock market what the
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:23.560]  average pension funds are down by about 65% I mean a is that the correct number
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:27.360]  because I see higher numbers lower numbers bandied about and how long
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:35.080]  until the people realize that this was done by design well I think they won't
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:41.200]  want to admit it and the design has been there for a long time but they're not
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:45.680]  have to what's going on and they have to listen to programs like this in order to
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:50.560]  find out and they will in time but most of them just don't know I just wrote
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:56.440]  this this morning state governments ran a pension fund losses of 865.1
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:03:05.800]  billion dollars and 2008 the assets of 109 pension funds fell 37% to 1.46
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:10.960]  trillion in the 14-month period ending this past December CalPERS the biggest
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:18.440]  fund with 260 billion dollars in assets and at height in October 2007 is down
[2:03:18.440 --> 2:03:26.360]  over that period time 40% so I think a fair figure is on average is 40%
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:32.360]  except for pension funds that kept all their money in bonds and also insurance
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:37.160]  companies which are mutual companies who kept their money in bonds they are
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:43.000]  safer where do we get this number of of people's savings or 401ks or
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:47.040]  retirements that are based on stock being done over 60% is that folks that
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:52.880]  were invested in the wrong sectors or that could be but overall you have to
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:57.240]  take the more conservative viewpoint so in the last 20 months since the market
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:03.080]  started down from 14,160 or whatever the number was up there and we get out
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:10.920]  of everybody out at 14 incidentally who was listening that drop in in those
[2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:16.520]  professional managed portfolios is down about 45% on average all right so it's
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:21.080]  not very good and if the got down goes where I think it will go to around
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:28.440]  4,000 38 to 4,200 then I think they're going to take another 35% hit and so
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.280]  they're going to be off about 80% and that means a lot of them won't pay the
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:37.320]  way they could otherwise and who what do we know is going to be going on at that
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:43.680]  time amazing absolutely amazing and these companies can't fund themselves now
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:50.360]  the stock values down it's just a effect a domino effect Bob Chapman will see
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:54.160]  you next Friday Godspeed they're spending time with us thank you Alex bye bye

[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:10.720]  there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:17.840]  well joining us from the United Kingdom at Janine Roberts we had her on eight
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:25.800]  years ago I remember back in college or was it high school seeing on PBS part of
[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:31.520]  the film that she made the Diamond Empire I've since seen the whole thing and
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:34.440]  it was everything that I'd already learned and read in history and also
[2:08:34.440 --> 2:08:38.400]  learned from my dad who had gone to college with some French guys who were
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:42.440]  South African who had tried to break the diamond monopoly in their own little
[2:08:42.440 --> 2:08:48.640]  way the DeBoule brothers and they're the guys that actually bought up some
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:53.600]  diamond mines in in Arkansas and the federal government claimed environmental
[2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:58.680]  reasons and bought them out for billions of dollars so that happened later but
[2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:03.320]  just so I've kind of from my position seen a little bit of the inside of this
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:07.680]  going on growing up in Dallas because my dad was you know it still has friends
[2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:13.520]  with the DeBoule brothers but separate from De Beers that's a that's the big
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:18.880]  monopoly but it's just amazing and then I've seen articles in things like New
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:22.680]  Yorker magazine where De Beers brags they hire mercenaries and attack
[2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:26.160]  helicopters to go in you know and we hear this propaganda about stopping
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:30.080]  blood diamonds so anybody else that mines them that isn't certified is hurting
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:34.200]  children no that's propaganda it is the diamond monopoly that causes all the
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:38.400]  violence these things are only semi-precious and now that's the basics
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:43.240]  we're carrying her new book glitter and greed by Janine Roberts we have it in the
[2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:47.160]  shopping cart at info wars.com for those that want to explain to their wife or
[2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:51.000]  their girlfriend or their fiance you know who wants some $20,000 diamond ring
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:54.360]  she's got to have it that they are semi-precious and if she wants a fine
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:58.440]  stone get something else like a ruby or an emerald that actually has true value
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:02.240]  people kind of found this out now so they're buying colored diamonds because
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:07.320]  those actually are rare in some cases but don't be chumps don't be ripped off
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:10.400]  she was physically attacked over making the film and threatened not to release
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:14.200]  it but she still did just just an incredible lady so Janine Roberts
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:19.200]  joining us from England thank you for coming on. It's a pleasure, it's a great privilege.
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:26.160]  Okay you got the floor just just boil it down your story your saga the film the
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:29.760]  book everything you went through what you discovered how you got in when they
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:33.440]  wouldn't let anybody else get in and show warehouses of just diamonds being
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:39.000]  masked to create artificial scarcity. I've done my hands through buckets of
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:44.560]  diamonds literally literally thousands of diamonds they're not you know the thing
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:49.360]  about diamonds is unlike some other stones like sapphires and emeralds they're not really
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:57.760]  that rare you can even manufacture them you can even cheat and but you know a
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:01.440]  long time ago they were rare that's when they came out of Indian Indian mines
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:06.200]  were running down and the rich folk in Europe they bought up these diamonds
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.760]  infested in them but then people went out to South Africa and they went on to
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:18.960]  Australia and they found them by the not the bucket full but by the bath full in
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:26.480]  South Africa I've been told by a foreman that ran parts of a De Beers mine
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:32.080]  that occasionally breaks through into pockets of diamonds underground and they
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:36.160]  literally shuffled up the diamonds they could take them as to workers out to the
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:42.080]  area they put the diamonds into buckets and they bring them to the surface but
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:45.160]  yeah but I've been back since you went out there and this is how I was taught
[2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:51.280]  to you I've been back out in South Africa and I've got you know I've I found
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:59.160]  things I only heard rumors about and it's really bad inside some of the mines
[2:11:59.160 --> 2:12:05.160]  what I discovered was that this is new what I discovered was that inside some of
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:12.600]  the biggest mines in South Africa De Beers gets exemption from normal practices
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:17.400]  normal health and safety practices it says the dust inside its mines is
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:22.840]  harmless like normally when someone goes down in the mine to mine copper or
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:28.240]  nickel they have to have a hose pipe and spray the rock face in front of them
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:32.720]  with water to catch all the dust all the dangerous dust the silica especially
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:39.800]  because I can see the coast as it cuts your lungs to ribbons well De Beers
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:43.200]  said oh no it doesn't happen in our mines it's they get it same shouldn't they
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:47.520]  don't have to use any water mine dust they tell the government in South
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:56.040]  Africa is harmless well I one day I was in a De Beers mine and shop Stuart turned
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:01.200]  to me and said do you know Jan we sometimes are mining the diamonds
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.320]  directly out of asbestos we're only given a cloth to cover our mouths and we've
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:10.640]  got to keep that same cloth for a year now for those that don't know ideas and a
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:14.240]  bit of cloth over the mouth for those that don't know asbestos is a mineral
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:17.880]  and that has little tiny hooks and destroys the lungs and in diamonds
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:23.400]  routinely our mind out of asbestos beds because that happens at this rock
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:29.000]  Christ's light it's on this found in the same place that if I'm diamond yes
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:35.280]  in place and what it is is fine needles needles that you breathe in and they
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:40.200]  cut into your lungs only and they give you a horrifying death of an issue and
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:45.880]  they have these poor Africans down in these deep deep mines just breathing in
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:49.560]  all of this and they as you said can coat things with water and this wouldn't
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:53.000]  happen but they just don't care because they're so ruthless and should probably
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.720]  one one mine worker and I'm not telling doors of mine workers around township
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:01.960]  not for the doors and I found one in three had damaged lungs many of them are
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:07.720]  lost parts of the lung or whole lung and one mine worker said to me then I've
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:11.840]  worked in copper mines other mines and there's always water but in diamond
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:17.400]  mines I reckon you anything I can think of I might be wrong but they want it
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:23.240]  dusty they want it full of dust so we can't see the diamonds you couldn't
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:29.400]  do any other reason for this to happen and one professor best emeritus of
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:34.480]  public health told me it tested 200 workers coming out the premier diamond
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:41.080]  mine and every single one of them had a spistosis you know terrible lung disease
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:44.280]  well I want to I want to get into this but I want to start at the beginning I
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:47.560]  mean explain to people how the diamond trade works how you made this
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:52.920]  international film that was just really opened up the big secret that diamonds
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:57.880]  are semi-precious and it's a artificial scarcity scam set up by the Royal
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:01.160]  Family and Cecil Rhodes and now to beers I mean break that down and then the
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:06.480]  story of how they they told you to shut up in this because I worked at I will
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:10.480]  people I break news in Australia and I went down and they found the world's
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:16.520]  biggest diamond deposit on a place that where women used to go to pray but the
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:21.240]  history of it I started and that's what got me into diamonds and I started
[2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:29.040]  uncovering this rabbit one of you know rid of the seat when they found these
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:32.800]  red when diamonds are really rare they found diamonds literally sparking in
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:38.040]  the moonlight in Africa they had black workers to crawl along on top of the
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:41.800]  sand with tin cans around the neck and a gag on their mouth they couldn't
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:47.320]  swallow any diamonds and kind of get away with them and they pick up these
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:51.560]  diamonds and they clink them into the tins literally sparking in the moon
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:58.640]  night and then they got right that's the roads in the other way in the Oppenheimers
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:05.880]  the Rothschilds they're finding so many diamonds that the price of diamonds are
[2:16:05.880 --> 2:16:13.240]  sure to crash so Cecil Rhodes the enterprising man he said to the merchants
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:20.760]  in Europe look you've fun to me to buy up all the diamond leases in Africa you're
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:25.880]  rich you can do it you can find me and I promise I won't sell the diamonds to
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:32.440]  anyone else but you you just set up your own cartel I'll sell to you that's what
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:37.680]  he did he bought control of the major diamond finds in southern Africa set up
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:44.160]  the company to bear and with a contract to sell all the diamonds produced to the
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:47.960]  merchants in Europe who will put away their safes and their faults and
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:54.720]  pretend they're rare later on they one of the workers from one of the London
[2:16:54.720 --> 2:17:01.240]  plants London cutting shops went out there he was and his Oppenheimer and he
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:06.880]  actually went out there Cecil Rhodes he just died an Oppenheimer had control
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:12.680]  he managed to control both in Europe over the merchants and the mines in
[2:17:12.680 --> 2:17:18.800]  southern Africa and it gave to be as all the senses had ever since other mines
[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:24.440]  to be are sabotaged in his diary he says how he buys up farms in order to stop
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:30.840]  production I found game parts put up on top of diamond fields in order that the
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:35.080]  diamonds can't get mined I've been taking I've been told where they are by
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:39.160]  the best geologists and I've oh yes they use phony environmentalism in the case
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:43.600]  of Arkansas huge diamond deposits they said no it doesn't matter if you bought
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:50.000]  that land the Bull Brothers Bill Clinton said it's for the earth well it's been
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:56.160]  turned into I went down there my free spirit self of little rock and is you
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:01.000]  know I paid what I think was saying like seven dollars seven bucks and you can
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:04.640]  actually get a license to dig for a day and people are down they dig for a day
[2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:08.960]  not now good now to go down deep on six foot and they're gonna fill a hole up at
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:12.720]  the end of the evening and then that's just one little area I've been there
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:18.160]  and dug to you know yeah yeah it's all the geology in the same as the pits in
[2:18:18.160 --> 2:18:24.800]  South Africa to be a thousand feet deep that hole put a diamond any question is
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:30.720]  why was it never mine property never mind industry and I talked to people I
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:36.400]  used to own that face they told me how it got sabotaged and how one night two or
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:39.920]  three of their plants widely separated all burst all burst into flame
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:45.400]  simultaneously to help sabotage that mine and now it's been turned into a
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:49.920]  National Park has never been mine commercially yet the geology when I
[2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:58.440]  went to Canberra okay I'm sorry when I went to Washington DC and geology
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:03.120]  department and got the plans out now the judge has said this is a good mine
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:07.400]  all the reports are as good as in the in South Africa it's never been mine
[2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:11.160]  commercially because the one place in the world where the beers could not
[2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:16.320]  control that deposit was in the United States of America because you got anti
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:22.720]  cartel mines law you know you got laws that stopped you so Bill Clinton made a
[2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:28.560]  National Park it was National Park before Bill Clinton yeah but he grabbed the
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:32.600]  separate area that the Bulls own I mean you're the expert on this I just know
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:42.280]  the backstory here locally yeah yeah yeah um yeah now now can there's mining
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:47.120]  diamonds and some other countries are mining them but they don't want to spoil
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:52.280]  the rocket bait they don't sell the diamonds any cheaper because it helps

[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:10.840]  people ask how I woke up to the new world order one way was learning when I was
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:15.880]  like 14 the diamonds were semi precious but a militarized crime syndicate
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:22.160]  control it they send in mercenaries to engage in assassinations attacks on
[2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:26.440]  countries if they reminding their own diamonds and now that's mainstream news
[2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:31.960]  you know and I grew up watching women do anything for diamonds just worshiping
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:38.160]  them and it's just crud and it's another scam by the globalist in Cecil Rhodes who
[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:42.120]  said he was gonna set up a world government it's the same people the same
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:46.640]  story Janine Roberts an amazing lady glitter and greed Janine you've broken

[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:02.400]  can get it I specifically though tell folks what happened when your film was
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:07.760]  coming out and it was gonna air on British US and European TV as it did I
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:11.000]  mean just to get it you know it's not just you talking to people that have been
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:14.360]  firebombed or attacked or killed or whatever them using nature preserves to
[2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:20.480]  shut down minds not let them be exploited yeah I interviewed terrorists
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:26.680]  working for to be as well in that film stop right there terrorist working
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:31.360]  television now stop stop stop terrorist working for the beers explain how that
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:38.360]  works where he was employed to ambush Africans who wanted to see if an African
[2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:42.520]  can carry a diamond into Europe he's allowed to do so it's quite legal if
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:47.540]  you mind himself get it to Europe you get international prices from it if you
[2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:54.920]  walk into Antwerp in Belgium you see signs in the window saying rough diamonds
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:26:01.640]  that's uncut diamonds bought here but the blizzards getting all those tainted as
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:06.320]  if they're not free trade but they're not individual enterprise but kind of
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:10.880]  calling them all blood diamonds in if a terrorist involved or not and what the
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:15.120]  beers did them what it seems they did I mean it says sister company and grow
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:20.160]  American that allegedly did this this guy we interviewed we interviewed my
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:26.480]  Latin America co-creator in hiding he's he reported that he's been paid to
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:34.080]  ambush Africans ambushed him keep them in prison and he admitted to torturing
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:38.840]  him if they were taking diamonds out that one time you know they should have
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:43.880]  gone in government terms should have gone for the hands of the beers he was
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:48.120]  there to stop the independent merchants as far as I could see to terrorize them
[2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:52.520]  stop then taking any diamonds they happen to find now when you see a film
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:57.800]  African you're not allowed to carry an uncut diamond in your pocket and they
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:01.520]  should our government license you're not even allowed to carry a bit of the rock
[2:27:01.520 --> 2:27:06.240]  in which they find diamonds that's illegal all right let me stop you're
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:13.080]  right there total cartel you see a movie like blood diamond they do reverse
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:18.640]  propaganda very complex really they admit there's a secret cartel controlling
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:23.320]  diamonds but they imply that they're the ones running blood diamonds that the
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:27.320]  individual Africans can smuggle out when it's actually the big cartel that wants
[2:27:27.320 --> 2:27:32.080]  to stop the Africans and aboriginals of Australia to have their diamonds and so
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:36.120]  liberals go and feel all good in Hollywood does and oh we're fighting for
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:40.440]  Africa when in reality they're working for the big cartels that have brought all
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:45.200]  this hell yeah it's way to be issues to have to have lots of public schoolboys
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:48.760]  from England these have sent them out to Africa with a big budget to buy up these
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:52.720]  diamonds they were going to national market and then to cut the beers diamonds
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:57.000]  but now what they do is they label nine out of ten diamonds that they label as
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:01.320]  blood diamonds and spot them trying to be traded more than nine out of ten it's
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:07.320]  more like 90 other he knows by 99 out of 100 I'm nothing to do a terrorism that
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:12.040]  all to do we keep them out of the hands of independent Africans so they can't
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:16.320]  trade for themselves that's why all the diamonds nearly are taken out of Africa
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:23.800]  and cut in other countries by the beers what go to Israel and a lot go to India
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:31.720]  get cut the three best ones come to the United States but Africans you know when
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:35.640]  they need their income they need to have a trade out there and we don't need to
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:40.760]  be giving them aid money we need to be trading with them so money in the diamonds
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:44.040]  they got the raw material they should get the maximum amount of money out of it
[2:28:44.040 --> 2:28:48.600]  that's the way to get get the one around feet so they can stand up and for the
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:52.600]  trade properly absolutely I have to do it they just you know their diamonds get
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:56.200]  taken out the country okay when we come back we've got a breaking in long
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:28:59.680]  segment Janine I want to tell the story about what happened to you physically
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:03.680]  right right as your film was coming out how they tried to intimidate you because
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:06.680]  that again goes directly to the heart of what we're facing and then the latest
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:12.600]  info is your investigations continue glitter and greed the secret world of
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:18.600]  the diamond cartel I want to talk about how long you've been doing this in fact

[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:06.240]  you asking the question can you start over and specifically tell folks the
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:09.520]  story how it happened what they said to you
[2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:15.280]  i was um to this the head of the business putting pressure on the bbc
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:21.920]  i was helping to help me make the film and then one night a gang broke into my
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:28.560]  home there's three of them uh they actually
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:34.000]  assaulted me but i've fought them off that part of it and then they just used
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:37.760]  me as a punch bag they broke my face up
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:40.880]  broke my cheekbone broke my nose broke my
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:48.800]  lines and my good eye otherwise lazy and i finished up got complications i was
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:54.000]  critically ill in the hospital for two weeks and i was two months in hospital
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.680]  all together and while i was critically ill they had
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:02.880]  lawyers come into the hospital to try to grab control over my film
[2:36:02.880 --> 2:36:08.320]  and it was pretty tough at the time now specifically uh going from memory here
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:10.800]  didn't the gang while they were pounding you
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:14.080]  tell you to not make the you know not release the film
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:20.400]  no they used personal insults to me they it was the way next day the lawyers came
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:24.400]  and demanded control over the film it was like uh there was me all black and
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:27.600]  blue and i was ambushed by lawyers who claimed to
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:31.440]  got some rights but it didn't had no rights
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:35.600]  it was and they wanted control and i later heard
[2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:39.120]  they put pressure on the bbc from at highest level
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:42.800]  try to get me dropped as producer or to film and when my name still stayed on
[2:36:42.800 --> 2:36:49.200]  the film they threatened the bbc um but my film was never found
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:52.560]  libas no legal actions against it but there were threats
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:56.400]  of plenty i've now got rights back to it
[2:36:56.400 --> 2:37:01.360]  and uh but it took me a real battle i showed it just the same i i came
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:06.080]  over i was invited to congress to a congressional airing in washington
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:11.680]  to talk about diamonds and human rights and the film was seen by congressman
[2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:16.080]  and i was invited to the arctic waste of canada to search for the mine workers
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:19.920]  at finding diamonds in canada too
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:25.920]  yeah so i got my credit back to it but it was a very tough time
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:29.360]  but your film now has aired in quite a few parts of the world i know i saw it on
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:37.280]  pb has a yes and the dvd is the uh longer version of the film
[2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:41.040]  the one on the internet is a shorter version but the longer version
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:46.400]  high quality that's why it's on the dvd so that's not available on the internet
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:48.960]  at the moment yes yes well good people should get the dvd
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:52.720]  you went through hell to make this and it's your type of courage it's a
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:56.640]  testament uh to the human spirit i mean now it is widely known that
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:00.560]  diamonds are semi-precious in a scam and they've lost after the whole thing i
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:03.760]  advised on the united states clean diamond ad
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:08.640]  but unfortunately the only way for diamonds produced by rebels
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.800]  so like there was a mine in the congo where amity international reported that
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:17.280]  there were bodies floating down the river outside the mine that children
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:21.600]  were in the prison inside a diamond mine and diamonds from there were being
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:26.160]  sold as clean to the united states because they weren't
[2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:29.600]  produced by rebels they were produced by a government company
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:33.920]  in cooperation with the bears who partly owned it
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:38.160]  so they were clean yeah so they would human rights violations are going on
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:42.480]  yeah they blame their own actions on anybody else that wants to buy diamonds
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:45.200]  i've read that they've lost some of their monopoly what they have about 90
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:48.400]  percent of world diamond monopoly now
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:52.160]  uh they've got less than that they've got but it doesn't matter because everyone
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:57.280]  else all the other major producers are tamely following along behind the
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:00.800]  bears profiting from the high prices that the bears
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:05.440]  maintained by force so the other guys are not challenging them
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:10.000]  they're not trying to undercut them they don't dare do it
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:13.920]  so that the canadiens will start they got quite a lot of diamond mines up there
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:19.040]  now in the arctic they're not undercutting the bears
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:22.640]  all right let's still lead in the field it's still in control
[2:39:22.640 --> 2:39:25.920]  okay let's get into the new information you you covering glitter and green and a
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:27.760]  new investigation that isn't even in the book
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:30.960]  uh cover your latest info you you already told us about the uh
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:34.400]  asbestos mineral uh that the diamonds are mined out of and they're not allowed
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:37.360]  to yes i was out in south africa about a year ago and
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:41.520]  yeah i i thought it's all adopters and i found you know i got definite proof and
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:46.000]  i found a white woman he was a health and safety officer she only had to go
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.520]  down the mine twice a week and you can't take her
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:52.960]  children up now from the damage to her lungs
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:56.320]  she just you know she's a fit woman and she's just
[2:39:56.320 --> 2:40:00.240]  tragic she's lost part of one of the lungs she got
[2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:05.440]  deceased in the lungs from the asbestos dust and all she was going down i think
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.360]  she spent two afternoons every week inside the mine
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:12.720]  and i've seen her x-rays and see how within a year
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:16.080]  damage was showing up within her on her x-rays
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:19.760]  and so if that happens to me one of the supervisors what about the workers that
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:23.840]  down there every day for eight hours or more
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:30.000]  you know i know i know i just um it's great it's greed it's pure greed
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:33.920]  they mine these diamonds and there's some five dollars a carrot
[2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:39.440]  that's what they pay five dollars a carrot then they sell a carrot at diamonds
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:43.360]  for twenty thousand dollars in the united states
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:47.280]  i've seen eight-year-old children cutting diamonds
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:54.480]  in india um i've seen these children sleeping on the floor of the workshops
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:59.840]  um with their kind of toothbrush back to the side of the spinning wheel
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:04.320]  no safety precautions nothing to stop the dust the corrosive dust from the
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:07.680]  ground diamond going straight into their lungs
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:11.760]  and this is how the psychological warfare works so women and men can keep
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:14.960]  buying them they go oh there's bad diamonds and there's good
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:18.320]  diamonds and then they blame all their evil activity on the bad
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:22.400]  diamond people when that's really them and then women still go out and buy them
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:25.760]  i i think the answer is don't buy these dirty things
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:30.320]  now i think you know what i like to see has to be honest but i like to see
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:34.240]  major reform i don't see them have certificates and come out of
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:37.760]  diamonds where there's international inspectorate to make sure that the
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:42.160]  mind-working property and the cutters have got ethical
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:45.840]  you know decent conditions but the bankers will just buy that
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:49.360]  will just control the international inspectorate i mean who set up the un
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:53.120]  was the Cecil Rhodes combine needs to be
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:56.560]  something many independent it needs to be new i agree with you well we need to
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:59.920]  have people need to fund you know their own investigative
[2:41:59.920 --> 2:42:02.400]  foundations but see the people don't have the money
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:05.600]  to go out and do investigations and expose it
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:09.840]  and just like with organic food that it would get that trusted group
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:13.600]  certification i just said can i mention another book
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:16.880]  coming out this year oh yeah tell us the latest you said you're working on new
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:19.600]  investigations yes yeah it's a book called fear of the
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:24.720]  invisible and it's into the pharmaceutical industry
[2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:30.640]  in the same thing that Dick Cheney had well we want to get you back on about
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:33.760]  the drugs that have been sold i've been looking at childhood
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:38.960]  vaccines autism and all that stuff that gets your
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:41.040]  children can't go to school unless they've had these
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:44.480]  injections and i've i've got transcripts out of
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:49.200]  washington dc that haven't seen the light of day before
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:52.720]  on the top british and american scientists
[2:42:52.720 --> 2:42:56.640]  meeting together talk behind closed doors and no
[2:42:56.640 --> 2:43:01.040]  journalist in the room about the safety of vaccines and what they say behind
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:06.960]  closed doors is nothing like what they say to the public
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:10.640]  i've been warned again i've had a british government scientist say to me
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:13.760]  please don't tell parents about this stuff because we don't want to put them
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:16.400]  off vaccines well for those that don't know i don't
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:20.480]  know about your investigation but separately even abc news
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:24.320]  in 2004 reported on when congress congressman dan
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:30.640]  burton went and had the document seized the high-level cdc in fda meetings
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:33.200]  where they said do not give it to your grandchildren not give it to your
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:35.360]  children millions have been brain damaged from the
[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:39.040]  mercury alone and other things uh the cancer virus is all of it we
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:43.280]  cannot let the public know they will lynch us and so they can take
[2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:47.520]  you know there's no public in my book the very first time i show how these
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:50.880]  things are made i go right through it really carefully
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:54.800]  after all the questions because when i what happened here
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:44:00.480]  i was over in the united kingdom and um my brother phoned me up and told me that
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:04.240]  his neighbors in the same set you know they
[2:44:04.240 --> 2:44:11.040]  were they've got brain damaged child just after having an mmr vaccination
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:14.240]  and they wanted to say that you call yourself an investigated journalist has
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:16.960]  the government been hiding anything from us
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:20.240]  but to be honest at that point i hadn't got a clue
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:25.040]  i hadn't been looking into it i've been believing what the doctors told me
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:30.240]  and but i've you know i've gone into it as deeply as i can just like i've done
[2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:35.600]  on diamonds and i've uncovered a can of worms you
[2:44:35.600 --> 2:44:40.800]  know it's just i'm staggered i'm just terrified
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:46.240]  um you know i'm happy to say my daughter hasn't had my grandchild
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:49.120]  vaccinated my daughter wasn't vaccinated
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:57.360]  but the uh i you know it's well i tell you the meeting
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:00.880]  was chaired by the world health organization
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:06.800]  at the nih in washington dc and what they found for the woman had to say
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:13.280]  was that chicken leukemia virus was in the mmr vaccine
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:16.400]  they said that on record on a government record
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:21.760]  yeah chicken leukemia virus in mmr and they can't get it out
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:25.920]  well they don't want it out uh that's actually you're just yeah you just
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:29.600]  make they've lowered the standards by a hundred times
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:32.880]  and the manufacturers cannot purify the vaccines
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:36.240]  i'd always imagine that vaccine was a sterile fluid
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:39.840]  no sterile ingredient now it's filled with hundreds of different dna
[2:45:39.840 --> 2:45:44.000]  fragments and cancer viruses like that you're right dna fragments RNA
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:47.280]  fragments some of the scientific prions might be in there too
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:51.120]  and by the way this is in all their own documents uh they know what this is
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:56.720]  official documents i i'm you know i've just found this i found fraud
[2:45:56.720 --> 2:46:01.360]  in the uh documents on hiv from the cdc
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:04.160]  ma'am i have the government documents yeah that's from the vaccines
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:07.600]  i have the government documents and this is made you can google this it's a
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:12.800]  major websites over 200 million americans corp if it just
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:16.240]  it's just gonna up it's called fear of the invisible dot com
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:19.280]  fear of the invisible dot com that's the same as the book
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:22.480]  okay well i mean did you know i've got now
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:26.320]  two strands to my arm when i've done really you know major
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:31.200]  workers diamonds and viruses and all those diseases
[2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:35.360]  well did you know that um they're just scaring us they they try to scare you
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:39.120]  into buying stuff yeah did you know that the
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:46.640]  that the hv 40 um monkey virus uh all right that's what started me i was
[2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:52.640]  flown by a british television channel to attend an emergency workshop in the
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:57.280]  1990s at the national institutes of health and it was
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:04.160]  about simian fires 40 sp 40 being in the polio vaccine so i
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:07.600]  thought well how the rest of the monkey fires get into the polio vaccine and i
[2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:12.080]  find out that it's grown on dead monkeys
[2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:16.400]  the kidneys they kill monkeys they take their kidneys and their testicles
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:21.200]  because they can get to those two things easy and they put them in incubator
[2:47:21.200 --> 2:47:25.280]  mash them up sprinkle a previous batch of vaccine on
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.120]  top of them wait two or three days and then they
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:32.720]  they have a filter at the bottom and they filter off the fluid from the
[2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:35.680]  from the monkey cells and that's what goes into the
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:40.080]  the fact the fact the leading british expert at this international meeting
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:44.720]  at the nih this is an official record he said at one period of more monkey
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:47.120]  fires is in the polio vaccine than the world polio
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:50.880]  fires and then 200 million americans were given
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:54.320]  that and uh they confirm it's caused
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:59.520]  hundreds of millions of cases of the formerly rare cancers caused by the
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:03.520]  virus and now now it's just there's kids dying
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:06.720]  everywhere leukemia and died everywhere cancer
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:11.920]  around the world i should have watched the cover-up because i was one of the two
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:15.440]  scientific scientific journalists actually sat through
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:19.200]  all the tests with a laboratory from all over the world reporting that
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:22.480]  and then they had a press conference at the end for the press or lazy
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:26.240]  they didn't attend listen to the scientists direct me
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:30.240]  and one of the scientists they hadn't spoken out during the meetings
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:34.240]  told the president give it to his children yes so you
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:38.160]  that was totally misleading yeah you go to the meetings
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:41.520]  you go to the meetings you go to the meetings
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:45.280]  and you hear them in minutes killing everybody and then they go out of the
[2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:50.400]  building what we've got now the product in the flu vaccine we've got mercury and
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:53.840]  neurotoxin and what do we do to our senior citizens
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:58.400]  are getting brain diseases and dementia we give them mercury every year in the
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:02.560]  flu vaccine which causes that which causes brain damage
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:06.560]  yes well they admit i mean i just can't believe the insanity of this
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:10.560]  well it's eugenics ma'am and i'm glad you've done this and by the way you're
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:14.240]  an incredible person you're a activist journalist author and award-winning
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:17.600]  filmmaker janine roberts has over 30 years work focusing on mainly on
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:21.840]  environmental and human rights issues she's written five books the ma'am poon

[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:34.000]  Aboriginal resistance how a group held out against three military
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:39.040]  expeditions massacres to mining the colonization of Aboriginal Australia so
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:43.600]  you've been in the bush africa in in in australia you have really been on the
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:46.800]  front lines and it goes on and on and on

[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:53.600]  we have all the government documents so you've gone to one level but or maybe
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:57.200]  haven't given you a chance to go to the next this is all eugenics ma'am
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:02.640]  by design they're putting soft kill bio agents
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:06.240]  which debilitate and are hard to track why you're dying
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:11.200]  through the micro plasms through the dna uh artificially engineered viruses is
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:13.680]  what you can call them it's really a nano tech
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:17.440]  through the mercury through the monkey virus is the monkey virus is the 60
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:21.040]  year old bio weapon and the and the rock of fellers who funded
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:26.160]  hitler they're all behind this ibm are you aware of that level of this

[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:32.160]  it's right i mean i've i went out to go get myself in hot water all the time i
[2:56:32.160 --> 2:56:36.080]  mean i got my tires spiked a year ago i was in
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:42.240]  israel west bank palestine and it was uh israelis that spiked my tires
[2:56:42.240 --> 2:56:47.120]  both my front tires and the thing was i stopped to talk to a palestinian farmer
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:52.720]  and they said i must be a bad one so despite my wills

[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:01.200]  i'm reporting it i get there i got to see but
[2:57:01.200 --> 2:57:04.960]  you know the only way to see something to get the truth is you have to go there

[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:12.640]  well my question actually was your spike speaking earlier about how they've
[2:57:12.640 --> 2:57:16.000]  closed down this mine in the united states um when they discovered these
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:20.400]  diamonds how did they ever allow the canadian minds to open them because
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:23.360]  you know i did that did some research into it i'm apparently 60 percent of
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:27.520]  it's owned by rio tinto and in australia and the rest is a
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:31.520]  a guy by the name of harry winston isn't uh... yeah harry winston
[2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:35.840]  is actually facing me i will let her answer that go ahead
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:42.880]  hey when rio tintosink rt said that was one of my first targets my book about
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:47.200]  book called um massacres to mining that's nearly a book of mine was all about
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:50.960]  rio tintosink and how they operate with ulcer
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:56.240]  ruthlessness towards tribal peoples i make indians whoever they are
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:58:01.440]  i was up there i was asked up to yellow knight to advise the people up there
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:06.000]  i my film uh the local environmentalists wanted
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.920]  wanted to put my film on in yellow knife

[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:19.040]  it was front page headlines in the local newspaper
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:24.080]  and they insisted they flew me up there and uh

[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:22.800]  holding for a while okay i thought we were taking callers who were
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:26.480]  specifically for her in fact uh... okay but go ahead sir
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:30.080]  yeah i've been holding for a while i'm sorry mr. jones um but uh i just wanted
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:33.120]  to uh... um mentioned that someone was going on in
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:36.240]  florida about the economy and now the school district literally
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:40.560]  going bust and cutting everywhere uh... there's a protest going on and it's
[3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:43.120]  it's really really big i don't know if you know anything about it everything's
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:46.080]  going to collapse by design just like mexico i'm going to go back to you
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:49.360]  later because i specifically went to the calls and asked who was for mrs
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  roberts but thank you um you know our guest is here to specifically talk
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:56.080]  about diamonds or she expanded it out into vaccines
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:01:59.120]  uh janine roberts in the closing three minutes we have left final comments
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:01.760]  from you
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:06.720]  okay uh i was going to say that uh i watched the u.s military scientists in
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:11.040]  washington dc they were losing gas from the next door
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:14.880]  sewage plants and passing it through an osteocephaline torch
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:18.800]  and they were making diamonds from it real diamonds all those diamonds
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:24.320]  to tip missile cones and they're kind of joking about it because they said
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:28.880]  the gas from the sewage works next door it makes white diamonds
[3:02:28.880 --> 3:02:34.000]  you know really fine white diamonds and i've now found out that the beard has
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:37.680]  two plants one on the olive man of the british coast
[3:02:37.680 --> 3:02:42.400]  another one in south africa where you use similar technology to manufacture pure
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:46.880]  diamonds so when you get your diamonds your girlfriend if you do
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:51.360]  decide to get one we just remember it could be made by the sewage works
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:54.880]  plant yeah because they they they burn the
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:59.840]  methane and then get that pure carbon they do that i watched they were just
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:04.320]  injecting the gas into the osteocephaline flame you didn't need
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:08.480]  anything more than an ordinary welding torch
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:13.680]  do you need high pressure i mean technology is changing
[3:03:13.680 --> 3:03:19.280]  and i i mean if you want to get stones get emeralds or rubies or
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:22.800]  some of the other stones they haven't got such a rocket attached to them
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:26.880]  as diamonds they've got the worst rocket of a lot
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:31.040]  and it's simply i haven't had chance to say it but they
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:34.720]  went into american high school on second world war they
[3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:38.800]  started off then said by diamond it's patriotic people supporting wartime
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:44.960]  industries they sold it to us as an ancient tradition
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:50.240]  but the old tradition was in india where diamonds were worn by men because
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:53.840]  they're so hard as seen as a symbol of ferridity
[3:03:53.840 --> 3:03:59.760]  not a symbol of feminine charm and so they changed the old stories and they
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:02.880]  made a big myth about this and told everyone that
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:06.640]  if you want to get married you gotta give your girl a diamond and
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:09.600]  they invented the story and they took us for a ride
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:14.400]  and it works like a charm because people love to be suckers and the very same
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:16.800]  bankers the control the diamond trade and the drug
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:21.680]  trade are and illegal and legal are just gang raping us right now we got to
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:24.880]  fight them off like you did those thugs
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:27.760]  i mean i said right in the bankers i mean the way
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:31.040]  is bankers the way that bankers are treated after their banks they should
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:34.080]  be given medical treatment i mean they should be given
[3:04:34.080 --> 3:04:37.760]  psychological help because if they make a mess of our banks
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:40.880]  why give them more money well a mess for them is good
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:44.320]  uh janine roberts i mean it's like someone's
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:48.640]  got a gambling habit to give them more money
[3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:51.520]  well they got swat teams if you don't follow their orders they control the
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:54.720]  government they have a swat teams in the military so the fraud will continue

[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:24.000]  disproven now folks then they try to say people are over reporting
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:27.680]  and over diagnosing autism type disorders
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:31.040]  well that's funny uh people known we have one subs
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:34.400]  group of autistic folks are known as idiot savants
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:37.200]  that's the term used no insult to autistic children that's the term
[3:09:37.200 --> 3:09:40.720]  idiot savant i'm sure a lot of you've seen uh
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:48.160]  what's the film with rain man where he's the he's the card counter
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:51.760]  and he's the idiot savant uh and i mean there's really people who can do that
[3:09:51.760 --> 3:09:54.960]  they can you can say what's eight hundred and sixty seven million
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:58.480]  two hundred and you know ninety seven thousand combined with this algorithm of
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:01.920]  a two hundred and eighty four trillion you know google
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:04.480]  plexus and they can basically tell you the answer
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:08.480]  to the mathematical equation but they can't tie their shoelaces they can't
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:12.240]  do anything idiot savants were one in ten million
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:15.440]  i mean they were incredibly rare and autistic well you know was one in a
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:19.200]  million then it was one in uh twenty six thousand and now it
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:25.120]  was one in 168 and then it was uh one in 87 and
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:28.800]  they have whole wings of schools with the autistic children now and
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:32.400]  you get you take your children to see a movie i've done it a few times
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:36.160]  and uh they'll have whole rows of the autistic children
[3:10:36.160 --> 3:10:39.200]  and all these poor mothers there that were good mummies and gave them all the
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:44.800]  shots and you talk to these mothers and these you say when did this happen
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:51.440]  when did this uh first first unfold and they say oh 18 months and these
[3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:54.080]  mothers don't even know about vaccines and autism they're like
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:58.000]  oh he was 18 months or she was 18 months we gave him his third round of shots
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:02.240]  and then it happened um you'll need to communicate with john if she's there
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:04.960]  because i don't know no no one's no one's letting me know
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:12.400]  yeah um thank you yeah um so so all of this goes on
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:19.600]  all of this uh happens and it just gets worse and worse and worse
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:24.320]  and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:28.400]  and there's so many other you know situations now
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:34.480]  where government allows industry to do this and it's by design it's eugenics
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:38.480]  i mean i get up on air and i tell people half of
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:42.320]  corn syrup products have high levels of mercury now that's just a tested
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:45.760]  fact by independent industry in the government that google that folks
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:49.280]  um mercury corn syrup because people still email me don't believe this
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:54.000]  just just google and then hit news mercury in corn syrup and i want to
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:57.920]  show the washington post headline and now they just said you know what
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:01.520]  mercury isn't bad for you anymore and i have the newscast i've played it many
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:04.560]  times not gonna play it again you can just google news says mercury's good for
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:09.760]  you um it turns out that 90 plus percent
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:14.880]  i want to google this next just show the news article
[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:19.920]  90 plus percent of infant formula has melamine deadly plastic attacks all the
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:22.560]  organs the kidneys they just used to say it was bad
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:26.080]  people are dying all the place from they just say no it's good for you now
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:30.560]  uh bayer shipped out over a million ampules of factor eight filled with hiv
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:33.920]  and hepatitis knowingly came out in their own documents and lawsuits nobody
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:37.440]  gets in trouble it's just hey you know
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:41.440]  hiv is good for you hepatitis is good for you
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:48.160]  millions and millions and millions have died the government admits from the
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:51.760]  simian virus 40 alone and there's all these other viruses you know you heard
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:56.960]  last hour about leukemia viruses in your shots
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:00.480]  or all the government studies about how you have a massive increase in Alzheimer's
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:06.320]  if you take the shots we do have uh our guest on with us
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:11.520]  and i appreciate um barbara low fisher one of the founders of the non-profit
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:15.200]  national vaccine information center uh on with us and she's been tracking the
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:19.440]  propaganda the dis info being put out uh by the government's own court bought
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:22.720]  and paid for by the vaccine makers and so she joins us now with the balance of
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.240]  the hour we'll open the phones up later in the hour four uh barbara great to
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:32.320]  have you here with us so much okay uh break down the latest i know hpv's
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:36.080]  killing folks and maiming them and another is telling us that autism is
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:38.160]  a cause by vaccines now with this latest
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:41.920]  federal court ruling uh break down what's most important for folks to know
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:44.800]  right now uh my goodness there's so much going on
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:51.520]  and just in the past three weeks um yes uh we we issued a press release uh
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:55.760]  several weeks ago it was actually it was a special report that was carried on
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:14:01.520]  on cbs uh regarding garter still vaccine hpv vaccine that was licensed in
[3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:07.600]  2006 after being fast tracked uh the fda allowed merc to fast track that vaccine
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:12.160]  unfortunately because it's it's killing and brain injury and causing
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:17.200]  immune system problems really serious problems for a lot of girls and what
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:21.200]  what's really tragic a lot of these girls are very healthy
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:25.600]  high functioning i mean straight a student athletes gymnast cheerleaders
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:30.240]  um very very healthy girls who are getting one or more
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:35.200]  shots of garter cell and are dying within days or weeks of this
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:39.600]  vaccination are being left with seizure disorders that can't be
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:44.480]  controlled with medication uh rheumatoid arthritis symptoms
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:47.840]  they will collapse their blood pressure will drop and they will collapse
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:51.120]  there's inflammation of the heart inflammation of the brain
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:55.680]  inflammation of different organs in the body um it's it's really serious and
[3:14:55.680 --> 3:15:00.480]  if you if you go on to our website at nvi-w-w-n-b-i-c-c-dot-org
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:04.240]  you can uh search the med alerts database which we have
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:08.400]  provided the data that from the vaccine adverse event reporting system
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:12.320]  where you can go on and you can search and you can if you just click on
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:16.640]  hpv4 and search the field you can you can read the reports
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:20.080]  that are being made to the government which the government has dismissed as
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:24.480]  being all a coincidence in october they the government issued a report saying
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:27.920]  all of these girls who are dying and who are being brain injured
[3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:32.560]  are it's all a coincidence it has nothing to do with garter cell vaccine
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:35.360]  and we issued a report as i said several weeks ago
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:38.640]  what we did is we went in and we looked and compared
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:43.040]  garter cell vaccine reactions adverse event reports to the federal vaccine
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:47.920]  adverse event reporting system with another vaccine that is also used in
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:50.400]  the same age group that is 11 to 12 year old
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:55.920]  uh children and that vaccine is called minatra it's a vaccine for meningococcal
[3:15:55.920 --> 3:15:59.360]  and the difference between the two vaccines is that the
[3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:03.280]  meningococcal vaccine minatra is given to both boys and girls
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:07.680]  whereas garter cell is only given to girls and what we found was a three to
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:14.000]  30 times more uh uh reports of serious health
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  problems and death after uh garter cell
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:24.480]  than after uh minatra vaccine and you know we're talking twice as
[3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:28.480]  many emergency room visits we're talking
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:35.280]  seven times the the reports for for the field disabled or did not recover
[3:16:35.280 --> 3:16:39.920]  um it was clear that you had two vaccines
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:44.000]  and and if the vaccines were equally reactive if there if it was all a
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.880]  coincidence you would have actually had a higher
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:51.440]  incidence in the minatra group why because minatra is only given once
[3:16:51.440 --> 3:16:55.760]  it's given singly and you have it's given to boys and girls you have about
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:59.120]  16 million doses of that vaccine that have been given
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:02.960]  as of about the middle of last year and 15 million doses of garter cell
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:06.480]  garter cell is given three times so you really should have a if
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:10.240]  everything was the same you should have had more reaction reports
[3:17:10.240 --> 3:17:14.640]  um after minatra so clearly we've got a problem with garter cell
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:18.480]  and i think that it's really important for anybody out there who is even
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:21.440]  considering having their daughter vaccinated with this vaccine
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:25.760]  they've got to to do their own research before they take that child in
[3:17:25.760 --> 3:17:29.280]  well i just want to add that i just noticed with exact headlines from
[3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:32.720]  articles we've written and linked to that there's some type of google block
[3:17:32.720 --> 3:17:36.160]  right now uh on separate issue i was just looking
[3:17:36.160 --> 3:17:39.520]  for it melamine and 90 percent of baby formula that was a washington post
[3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:42.720]  headline it's not even available on news or
[3:17:42.720 --> 3:17:46.080]  web they are scrubbing have you run into this
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:49.200]  well it's interesting you bring that up because i did
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:53.200]  uh there was someone who said to me the other day
[3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:58.800]  that she had gone in and she's actually uh researching hepatitis b vaccine
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:03.840]  and that that reports uh that that she'd been able to get
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:08.960]  on that vaccine prior or no longer on i think this is the google search engine
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:12.560]  but she found him on other search engines and i i don't know
[3:18:12.560 --> 3:18:16.720]  whether there is uh there is this whitewashing going on there definitely
[3:18:16.720 --> 3:18:20.400]  is i put the exact headline in and it's not there
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:24.240]  this is this is this is getting sick you know i want to get into the facts and
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:26.080]  the data with you when we come back but but
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:30.240]  right now barbara i want to understand how do they think they're going to get
[3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:33.600]  away with all of this i mean not just the vaccines but
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:39.680]  mercury in in in half of the of the corn syrup 90 plus percent of the baby
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:43.600]  formula melamine and before it's a scientific fact it's killing people
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:46.400]  now they just say no it's good i mean it's almost like mass
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:49.680]  mental illness has happened well you know i mean
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:53.440]  certainly we have absolutely do not have enough regulation
[3:18:53.440 --> 3:18:57.840]  of the toxins which are which are being put into our environment by the
[3:18:57.840 --> 3:19:01.600]  chemical companies by pharmaceutical companies by many different
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:06.800]  companies that are producing these uh these products that are toxic
[3:19:06.800 --> 3:19:12.000]  and and it is only going to be changed by the people rising up
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:15.920]  and demanding that the politicians that they elect the legislators they elected
[3:19:15.920 --> 3:19:19.920]  the state and federal level are responsive to the concerns of the
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:23.680]  people because otherwise we are going to become consumers of toxic
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:26.800]  product and what and particularly in the area of vaccination
[3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:30.480]  when they are when there's calls to end the exemptions to end religious
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:33.520]  and philosophical exemption leaving only medical exemption
[3:19:33.520 --> 3:19:37.280]  which you can't even get anymore we become captive
[3:19:37.280 --> 3:19:40.400]  you know captive consumers of toxic products

[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:24.000]  barberlofisher the head of the preeminent organization that fights for
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:28.080]  people to know the truth about vaccines and know what's happening
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:31.360]  the national vaccine information centers are guest please continue going
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:34.400]  down on the holocaust that's happening
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:38.000]  well you had mentioned prior to break that you know what's happened in the
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:42.880]  u.s. court of claims here in washington with regard to giving compensation to
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:46.160]  children who have been injured back by vaccines you know
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:49.840]  many years ago when the 1986 national childhood vaccine injury
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:54.560]  act was passed our children were only being asked by government
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:24:58.800]  recommended by government to get seven vaccines it was 23 doses of seven
[3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:02.400]  vaccines it was measles monster umbrella in mmr
[3:25:02.400 --> 3:25:05.680]  and dpt diphtheria pertussis tetanus in polio so seven
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:09.840]  23 doses of seven vaccines that law was supposed to be
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:15.600]  for vaccines that you know caught like polio that that that we were trying to
[3:25:15.600 --> 3:25:21.200]  control polio it was not for vaccines like
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:24.880]  garter cell as i was speaking before or some
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:29.680]  rotavirus and these other other vaccines that have now come out since then
[3:25:29.680 --> 3:25:33.680]  and now our children are getting 69 doses of 16 vaccines
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:36.960]  and a lot of children are regressing after getting
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:40.480]  all of these vaccines sometimes eight to ten vaccines on one day
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:44.160]  and they're regressing and they're becoming autistic learning disabled
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:48.880]  having adhd add uh intestinal bowel disorders
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:53.360]  uh... et cetera well the government doesn't really want to acknowledge that
[3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:56.160]  this is occurring and so what's happened over the years
[3:25:56.160 --> 3:25:59.760]  is a system that was supposed to provide parents with an alternative
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:03.600]  to doing doctors in court it was really what i call an experiment
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:07.120]  in tort reform there was a lot of pressure for tort reform
[3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:11.440]  uh... 20 years ago and congress was persuaded by the vaccine manufacturers
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:14.480]  they told congress in the country they were going to leave this country
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:18.320]  without any vaccines congress said we are going to protect these companies
[3:26:18.320 --> 3:26:22.880]  so we came to table and fought for as much as we had no power we came and
[3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:26.000]  fought for as much as we could get for the families
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:30.080]  now what was supposed to be a no fault non-adversarial alternative to a lawsuit
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:33.840]  has turned into a mock court trial in this u.s court of claims
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:37.280]  where instead of being allowed to to plead your case in front of a jury of
[3:26:37.280 --> 3:26:41.040]  your peers you are pleading your case in front of one person
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:44.640]  a special master appointed by the u.s court of claims
[3:26:44.640 --> 3:26:48.400]  so over the years what what what the uh departments of justice and
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:51.120]  uh departments of health and human services have done
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:54.240]  is that they've really gutted the original deal that was made
[3:26:54.240 --> 3:26:58.480]  on the in this law which was supposed to presume causation
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:02.320]  in the absence of a better explanation that is children were supposed to be
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:06.080]  compensated if you could not find an alternative
[3:27:06.080 --> 3:27:09.280]  explanation to why they became brain injured or died
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:12.720]  after vaccination it was never supposed to be a place where you were supposed
[3:27:12.720 --> 3:27:17.040]  to prove causation in fact like you have to in a civil court of law
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:20.880]  but over the years because they've gutted the system and made it very very
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:24.320]  weak and and and very hard for plaintiff lawyers
[3:27:24.320 --> 3:27:28.320]  and the victims what it's it's turned into this this joke
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:31.760]  and and and the results the culmination of it was what happened
[3:27:31.760 --> 3:27:35.680]  several weeks ago when the u.s court of claims and and you know i don't even
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:38.640]  know how this happened and that there was like this class
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:41.840]  action suit in effect that was brought on behalf of
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:46.160]  like about five thousand children who had regressed after vaccination into
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:49.360]  autism and there were only two very narrow biological
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:52.800]  mechanism arguments made that had to do with thimerosal
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:57.040]  and mmr vaccine even though there are many other biological mechanisms that
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:00.160]  could have been argued or been argued differently
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:03.760]  so they lumped all of these children into two
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:07.440]  small narrow arguments as to why they were
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:13.040]  brain injured by these vaccines and what happened was because the really good
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:16.640]  studies that should be published in the medical literature don't get published
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:19.920]  why don't they get published because the pharmaceutical industry has an
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:23.920]  inordinate influence on what is published in the medical literature
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:27.760]  and that was the same week that that is actually the same day that that court
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:33.600]  um the judgment was issued which denied these children compensation
[3:28:33.600 --> 3:28:36.640]  the british medical journal had the courage for once
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:41.040]  to publish an article by tom jefferson out of it italy an epidemiologist has a
[3:28:41.040 --> 3:28:44.480]  lot of integrity who publishes a review for the conquering
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:49.360]  collaboration and he showed that on influenza vaccine for example
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:52.720]  he showed with doing an actual epidemiological
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:56.800]  analysis that the studies that are that are funded
[3:28:56.800 --> 3:29:00.320]  by the pharmaceutical companies get preferential treatment
[3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:03.840]  in the medical journal and those who are not funded by
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:09.440]  by pharma pharma don't get published or are are not valued as highly
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:13.040]  so what did the u.s court of claims judges how special masters have to
[3:29:13.040 --> 3:29:16.640]  consider they had inadequate evidence to consider
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:19.520]  officially because you don't have the studies published that should be
[3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:23.040]  published plus you have lousy studies published so
[3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:26.960]  what happened net net was they they rejected
[3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:31.200]  these three cases which which is going to have an impact on all of those other
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:35.120]  children yeah setting a precedent barbara low fishers stay there
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:38.000]  we're going to come back and get more into this
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:42.080]  and talk about solutions because we are reaching critical mass folks are really
[3:29:42.080 --> 3:29:44.960]  waking up right now the fact that these vaccines
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:48.560]  are killing and maiming a lot of people
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:29:55.760]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:55.760 --> 3:30:00.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:32:05.200 --> 3:32:08.640]  with the recent bailout international bankers and power brokers
[3:32:08.640 --> 3:32:12.480]  have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world
[3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:15.520]  bank to act as saviour but we've only seen the beginning
[3:32:15.520 --> 3:32:19.200]  their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern
[3:32:19.200 --> 3:32:22.240]  times shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and
[3:32:22.240 --> 3:32:24.800]  panic across the land the insiders have discovered
[3:32:24.800 --> 3:32:28.000]  that they must control two things to seize total power
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:31.680]  phase one is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to
[3:32:31.680 --> 3:32:36.480]  accept phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies

[3:33:01.600 --> 3:33:10.560]  all right going back to barbara lofischer some of your phone calls for
[3:33:10.560 --> 3:33:17.600]  coming up specifically on the vaccine issue 1-800-259-9231
[3:33:17.600 --> 3:33:20.880]  now i know in in globalist documents we covered my film in-game blueprint for
[3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:24.320]  global enslavement they say they would use vaccines to put the soft kill
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:27.360]  weapons uh the viruses uh the chemicals that
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:32.160]  dumb people down to create this new society but there's no doubt
[3:33:32.160 --> 3:33:34.800]  that these big companies know it's hurting people the government knows
[3:33:34.800 --> 3:33:38.800]  it's hurting people and they're doing it and i guess we should probably get
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:42.240]  you know into discussion with you about the fact that all over the country they
[3:33:42.240 --> 3:33:45.520]  do these stunts where they say it's the law you've got to have shots
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:49.520]  or you're going to jail when there's waivers
[3:33:49.520 --> 3:33:52.320]  to not have to take them to go to school or work at a certain business
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:55.200]  but those waivers themselves aren't even law to get one
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:33:58.960]  now they're trying to deny waivers uh so they train us first to take a waiver
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:01.360]  then they take the waiver away when there's not even a law
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:04.640]  that's kind of like the nis and the animal id and all that too taking over
[3:34:04.640 --> 3:34:08.640]  farms it's this color of law where they train us to do things that aren't even
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:13.200]  the law where is the fight going because as people wake up to the
[3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:17.360]  fact that vaccines are just deadly and horrible and is now we see pr ads
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:20.640]  everywhere about how corn serves good for us and how vaccines are good for us
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:24.960]  and how melamine's okay for us i mean that's on the you know tv now as ads
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:28.880]  that shows they're getting desperate so i mean that's exciting to know people
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:32.080]  are waking up but the establishment's counter striking saying we're just
[3:34:32.080 --> 3:34:35.360]  going to go ahead and try to actually pass laws to make you take them
[3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:39.680]  because you know you're figuring out that we lied to you and there's no law
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:43.520]  i mean i mean that's a mouthful but can you comment on that i agree with you
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:47.120]  i i well i'll tell you what i'm really concerned about
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:53.200]  um in the early 1990s um pharmaceutical companies and government
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:56.560]  and actually even stars and hollywood unfortunately
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:02.160]  uh decided it was a great idea to set up electronic vaccine tracking systems
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:06.320]  they started in cities and then they moved to states
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:10.640]  and now we're going to see a national medical records
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:17.040]  electronic tracking system set up under the new stimulus plan and health
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:21.360]  in you know the reform of health insurance and the vaccine tracking systems
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:24.720]  are going to be definitely become part of that and
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:31.520]  you know in 1995 Donna Shalala and HHS appropriated the social
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:36.000]  security number for use in vaccine tracking systems that
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:42.720]  really the vaccine issue was the first use to justify electronic
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:46.800]  tracking of citizens in this country and let me just add let me just
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:51.040]  i'll just add for folks that aren't aware of this they're saying under the new
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:56.400]  national id and the new medical monitoring system that they're setting
[3:35:56.400 --> 3:35:59.600]  the policies through the bioethicist boards of the hospitals
[3:35:59.600 --> 3:36:02.480]  and they're and they're doing these scare stories about tuberculosis and things
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:05.440]  they let all the immigrants come in that they don't test them but then they're
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:08.880]  saying citizens and people won't be able to fly they're actually
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:12.480]  proposing this i'm sure you've heard of it if you haven't had all your shots up
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:15.360]  to date so they're really getting ready to to clamp down
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:21.120]  well indeed in the night in 1991 they forwarded this sort of national health care
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:24.800]  idea and the electronic medical tracking at that time
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:29.280]  people were outraged and they protested against them i remember NVIC my
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:32.640]  organization uh testified and said you know this is
[3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:35.440]  not a good idea we knew the vaccine tracking
[3:36:35.440 --> 3:36:39.360]  uh systems was what they wanted and we knew that there was going to be
[3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:43.280]  societal punishments attached most likely for not complying
[3:36:43.280 --> 3:36:46.640]  back then there was a suggestion by different people that you shouldn't be
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:51.440]  able to file your state or federal taxes and take an exemption for children
[3:36:51.440 --> 3:36:54.560]  especially if you couldn't show proof that the child had gotten all government
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:58.160]  recommended vaccines you couldn't get a driver's license
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:01.120]  they were talking at that time about planes planes you know getting on
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:04.720]  planes or going into stadiums or whatever and and and at the time the
[3:37:04.720 --> 3:37:08.240]  society was not ready for it well they took their time
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:11.520]  and now this is going to be forwarded i have always been
[3:37:11.520 --> 3:37:16.080]  very very concerned about this because you know once you have a tracking of
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:19.440]  everybody's movements and you have a tracking of everybody's health care
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:23.040]  records and vaccination status it is easy to
[3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:27.840]  attach societal sanctions for not for example vaccinating with all government
[3:37:27.840 --> 3:37:32.720]  recommended vaccines since 9-1-1 there definitely has been an attempt
[3:37:32.720 --> 3:37:37.440]  to to um define disease control as a matter of
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:41.680]  national international let me stop there this isn't some science fiction
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:45.520]  movie tommy thompson is health and human services secretary five years ago
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:48.480]  traveled to high schools all over the country and colleges and said
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:53.760]  every american by law needs an implantable microchip to stop epidemics
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:37:57.920]  so we can track all of you so they're openly saying forced chipping
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:38:02.160]  on record but then he refused to take it uh himself so
[3:38:02.160 --> 3:38:07.200]  so a lot of times people stand down to this stuff because it sounds so crazy
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:10.560]  but it's the government and the corporation's pushing it and i know
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:12.800]  they're a bunch of eugenicists that want to carry out
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:16.000]  health care rationing and getting rid of the old they but tom dash on this book
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:21.200]  said that it's in the bill to start rationing uh so this is eugenics this
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:24.800]  isn't good government health care you know which is bad enough it gives the
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:28.320]  government total control to make you do what they wanted in
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:31.840]  england as you know barbara but the listeners probably don't two years ago
[3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:34.960]  they started threatening people under government health care that they had to
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:38.080]  have all their vaccines or they're denying not just children
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:42.320]  but adults critical care you pay your taxes you're in a socialist system
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:45.040]  and they say you won't put in your body what we want
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:49.360]  you're not going to get health care well you know i
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:52.480]  yeah i had you have to understand it when i this happened to my son when i my
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:55.760]  son was vaccinated in 1980 there is no way
[3:38:55.760 --> 3:39:01.120]  that i ever imagined that i would learn the things that i've learned over the
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:07.200]  last 27 years and i you know i i i sat at the table with people
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:11.280]  from industry from government from special industry funded by industry
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:16.400]  i do not believe that all of them are deliberately trying to hurt people what
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:20.640]  i think is that ideology has definitely blinded people
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:24.400]  they they do see these vaccines i remember robert menelson who was the
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:27.440]  founder of the holistic health care movement in this country back in the
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:32.000]  1970s used to say that vaccination is the new sacrament
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:35.920]  and it is almost like a religion no it's a government religion
[3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:39.520]  oh give me the sacrament it's like a religion
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:44.000]  and that they believe or at least you know i don't i can't ascribe what
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:47.280]  everybody look at their eugenesis they want to set the precedent
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:50.880]  that we line up and take whatever shots they say just like going into the
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:53.200]  showers go ahead i do believe that they want us to
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:57.200]  take absolutely want to have create a system whereby we will
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:40:01.600]  be forced to take the product the pharmaceutical products and the
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:04.560]  vaccines that they believe are going to quote
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:08.720]  keep the society safe now i don't agree they've been doing national
[3:40:08.720 --> 3:40:11.440]  drills to forcibly inoculate us under fema
[3:40:11.440 --> 3:40:15.760]  well and i'm concerned that we have for whatever reason they're doing it
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:19.600]  we as a society as a people as a free people
[3:40:19.600 --> 3:40:23.280]  need to stand up and say we you know state legislators
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:27.120]  federal legislators you have got to pass legislation
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:30.480]  that is going to protect our right to inform consent
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:34.160]  to use of any pharmaceutical product or medical intervention that can kill or
[3:40:34.160 --> 3:40:38.080]  injure us or our children that is a fundamental right the right to bodily
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:41.840]  integrity to individual autonomy is a human right
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:45.840]  and we look the other way and are complacent and apathetic
[3:40:45.840 --> 3:40:50.160]  and trust blindly at our peril yeah let me say this for sure
[3:40:50.160 --> 3:40:53.440]  let me say this barbara lo fishing at your take on is one of the premium experts
[3:40:53.440 --> 3:40:55.680]  on this we're talking to all the doctors and you know
[3:40:55.680 --> 3:40:59.120]  constantly tracking all the latest developments in research
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:02.560]  even if vaccines you never heard anybody and were wonderful and were great
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:06.560]  it would be a wicked evil dangerous precedent to set a precedent where
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:08.640]  whatever the government says they want in our body
[3:41:08.640 --> 3:41:12.480]  they can force because down the road some evil group could come into control
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:18.000]  and do that but instead totally agree with you that's a very important statement
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  we have you know incrementally our freedoms are being taken from us
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:25.760]  and we and and people are sick leave such a busy life
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:30.640]  and they they need to understand they have to every single day be vigilant
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:34.400]  it the the price of freedom is eternal vigilance i believe that was thomas
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:37.760]  jefferson or someone who said that but it is so true
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:41.520]  because you you know if you get set up an infrastructure and a government that
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:46.240]  doesn't allow the people to have free choice particularly in health care
[3:41:46.240 --> 3:41:50.160]  then somebody as you point out could come in and use
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:54.320]  that against all of us and then you look at the truth the atomic soldiers the
[3:41:54.320 --> 3:41:58.640]  saskegee airmen uh the children being raided to death the thousands of them
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:01.920]  here in the u.s then you know it is a bad group
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:05.440]  already in control they set it up it is evil intentions it is bad
[3:42:05.440 --> 3:42:09.360]  you have a bunch of lazy bureaucrats control freaks at health departments and
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:11.280]  state health departments and federal level
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:14.160]  yeah they're just following orders they're compartmentalized
[3:42:14.160 --> 3:42:17.200]  they're blissfully ignorant they shoot their kids up and watch them get in the
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:20.240]  corner and you know be gone forever and they just
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:23.440]  rationalize it it's a sick cult and then they turn
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:26.560]  get into a cult like everybody dying of cancer because the hormones in the food
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:29.680]  the women and the breast cancer they make that a weird cult of you know
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:33.120]  getting together and and giving money to the very groups engineering it
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:37.600]  this is eugenics barbara and and this is being done by design
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:41.040]  and and bottom line what what collision do you see happening i mean the
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:44.400]  collision is already going on but i see it intensifying as the death
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:47.440]  of destruction the maiming the pain the
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:50.240]  the you know the u n's been caught putting sterilization hormones and
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:54.160]  tetanus shots that's on record i mean as more and more die and they go it's
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:57.520]  good it's good it's good we want to put it in in in
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:43:01.200]  in mosquitoes so you have to take it we want to put it in your food so you have
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:04.720]  to take it you know and as everybody's getting sick and they just keep going
[3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:08.080]  the men and swat teams will drop by if you don't take it where you're loving
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:12.000]  government i mean how can the cattle not see what's happening to them
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:16.400]  well you know if i've been really interested in what how hollywood
[3:43:16.400 --> 3:43:22.720]  in both film and in on television in drama in the evenings is starting to
[3:43:22.720 --> 3:43:26.400]  sort of shine a light on some of this through
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:29.920]  fiction i mean if you look at some of the films that have been out whether it's
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:33.280]  i am legend b for vendetta some of the films
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:38.640]  is it at the eleventh hour on on that is now that's because so many hollywood
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:42.320]  people have given the shots of their kids and i you know charlie sheen
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:45.760]  uh... and it's made and it's hurt their children
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:50.400]  it will certainly are creative people in society are authors are screen
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:53.920]  writers uh... play writers they they do
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:43:58.400]  sometimes see where things are going and they're like they they do that they
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:01.520]  ring the bell and i definitely see this this
[3:44:01.520 --> 3:44:05.520]  more and more you're you're seeing these themes of science
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:10.720]  gone amok uh... positions it is like the positions who who kind of are playing
[3:44:10.720 --> 3:44:14.960]  god and the result when you don't have the people
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:18.960]  have control over those who are in positions of power
[3:44:18.960 --> 3:44:22.560]  who are playing god i think that was my next that was my next point barbara
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:25.120]  we gotta have you back up soon for two hours once a year is not enough we
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:27.120]  appreciate you want to give up the website
[3:44:27.120 --> 3:44:30.080]  but the other side of that my wife tells me she watches a little bit of tv
[3:44:30.080 --> 3:44:33.040]  there's some show called the practice and it's all about how
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:36.080]  gotta get the abortion your backwards if you don't want it
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:39.120]  uh... you know just selling abortion i mean even if you're for abortion what's
[3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:42.320]  the fact of selling it uh... and then selling oh
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:45.440]  everybody dies or gets sick at the clinic because one person hadn't been
[3:44:45.440 --> 3:44:49.440]  vaccinated if you're supposedly vaccinated somebody who isn't vaccinated
[3:44:49.440 --> 3:44:53.360]  isn't going to infect you so we also see counter propaganda
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:57.360]  well certainly if if someone if one is going to take the risk with with getting
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:01.680]  a vaccine because every vaccine carries a risk it's greater for some than others
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:06.000]  then one should at least be at least my mind a hundred percent guarantee that
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:08.560]  that vaccine is going to work and you're right
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:11.520]  if the vaccines are as effective as the companies
[3:45:11.520 --> 3:45:14.880]  said they are and the government said they are then you should have them
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:18.240]  vaccinated should have nothing to fear from the unvaccinated and there shouldn't
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:21.680]  be such an issue about forcing people to get vaccinated if they
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:25.200]  don't want to now what about what about what happened
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:29.680]  in maryland year and a half ago i had the state attorney on
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:33.120]  and he said i have a vaccine to my kids and i said well why are there police
[3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:36.560]  dogs well in case there was any problem guys in riot year police dogs
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:39.040]  thousands of kids fifteen hundred kids and their parents
[3:45:39.040 --> 3:45:43.520]  thinking that it was the law to take shots crying not wanting it subconsciously
[3:45:43.520 --> 3:45:46.720]  you know knowing it was bad and then they didn't even show them waivers or let
[3:45:46.720 --> 3:45:50.480]  them know i mean this mass fraud of every year
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:54.240]  before school saying it's the law you got to take shots when it's not the law
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:45:57.360]  that right there should make everybody run from vaccines
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:46:01.680]  well i think a lot of people looked at that tv coverage and i was there that
[3:46:01.680 --> 3:46:05.840]  day and i i i can tell you it was a very chilling
[3:46:05.840 --> 3:46:09.920]  site because they've made sure that that's what team with those police
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:13.520]  dogs and and that and carrying guns were very visible
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:17.360]  they did it deliberately and they would not let anyone into that courthouse
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:21.280]  to to to look at what was happening including the media
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:24.880]  and so i i thought it was just a very chilling
[3:46:24.880 --> 3:46:28.400]  scene and i thought it was a wake-up call for everybody
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:31.600]  because this is an inappropriate uh... flexing
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:35.840]  of state power well and they went why were those kids lined up with their
[3:46:35.840 --> 3:46:40.320]  parents why were they summoned because they hadn't gotten the chickenpox
[3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:45.200]  or hepatitis b-shot give me a break well let's stop right there
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:48.480]  i mean i mean let's let's address and recognize you were there i want to i
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:51.200]  had we had other witnesses on but i didn't know you were there when you hear you
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:54.960]  lay it out there's a mass hoax where they say you'll
[3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:58.480]  be arrested if you don't take it and then i have the
[3:46:58.480 --> 3:47:01.760]  state attorney on he laughs and says my kids don't take it yeah alex i know
[3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:07.280]  it's not the law like it's funny and they think they're there crying
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:10.880]  thinking it's the law it was a mass exercise of
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:14.000]  false arrest of false and print i mean it's it's just
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:18.880]  with swat teams and dogs and armor and men in black and people lined up being
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:22.800]  injected and it wasn't even a law i mean it's a crime
[3:47:22.800 --> 3:47:27.440]  well you know i i i have one memory that really will always stay with me
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:32.800]  um i was there with my son and uh we had a video camera
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:37.200]  and i was trying to talk with the the the parents who were exiting with their
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:41.760]  kids to interview them about what had happened in the courthouse since
[3:47:41.760 --> 3:47:45.520]  nobody was allowed in and i there were these
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:49.680]  cement balls that were like hundreds of feet away from the entrance
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:52.800]  and i don't know why i guess that was cool but it realized that
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:56.880]  we weren't supposed to be on the other side of the balls we were supposed to
[3:47:56.880 --> 3:48:01.840]  be on the outer edge well i i had stepped in inside to to just
[3:48:01.840 --> 3:48:06.480]  of like 12 inches to talk to this mom who came out with her
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:12.880]  children and while we were talking the uh poll uh one of the swat team
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:20.240]  with his hand on his gun and the dog came out of the courthouse
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:25.200]  walking toward me and i'm telling you alex it was like i felt this thinking
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:29.840]  i felt my throat go into my stomach you know that kind of flash of fear and i
[3:48:29.840 --> 3:48:33.760]  thought to myself this must be how every any person
[3:48:33.760 --> 3:48:38.880]  who in any time in the world who has come up against the power of the state
[3:48:38.880 --> 3:48:42.480]  felt when they they knew that that power was coming
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:45.840]  toward them and it was i thought this is so inappropriate
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:49.600]  i did get on he motioned for me he directed me
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:53.120]  as he walked toward me with that dog to get on the other side of that cement
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:57.760]  ball now it was just such an inappropriate
[3:48:57.760 --> 3:49:02.080]  no no no stop stop it wasn't inappropriate it was hardcore vicious
[3:49:02.080 --> 3:49:07.200]  tyranny and once we cow to them you go to dc new york cops say no cameras turn
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:09.120]  them off we're going to watch you with our cameras
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:12.560]  it's just you're a slave get out there and lick my boots and meanwhile those

[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:20.000]  high five it's just it's really fun to serve the system and be evil
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:23.280]  and to not care and i saw the dogs and the cops
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:26.800]  and and they tell them to stand there like this going and we have video in the
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:30.000]  upcoming film the obama deception with just cops in new york literally with

[3:49:38.560 --> 3:49:41.680]  you're trying to talk to other slaves you're trying to

[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:23.280]  but tell them to take a call or two from Linda and Sarah maybe does or an
[3:54:23.280 --> 3:54:27.120]  animal see in the time we have left uh don't forget the Obama deception is

[3:54:39.520 --> 3:54:43.200]  we've been putting your blog and the national vaccine information
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:47.440]  center website up but but audibly give everybody those website addresses
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:54.080]  yes www.nvic.org that's for national vaccine information center
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:58.880]  nbic.org and the blog is vaccine awakening
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:03.520]  dot blogspot.com or just google Barbara Lowe Fisher and I see you out there
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:06.800]  fighting everywhere and you've gained so much credibility over the years I
[3:55:06.800 --> 3:55:08.800]  even see on a lot of mainstream television and
[3:55:08.800 --> 3:55:12.400]  it seems like we're winning the fight to wake people up but we're losing the
[3:55:12.400 --> 3:55:15.680]  fight with enforcing it on us I see an explosion
[3:55:15.680 --> 3:55:20.160]  I do see a crack a train crash coming I think that as the people become more
[3:55:20.160 --> 3:55:24.000]  enlightened as they they understand and have the
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:26.880]  information and certainly the internet in the last
[3:55:26.880 --> 3:55:30.560]  decade has has really brought this information
[3:55:30.560 --> 3:55:34.160]  to the people that they didn't have access to before
[3:55:34.160 --> 3:55:38.320]  and so and the internet is a way for people to communicate with each other
[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:42.960]  around the world so those in power are having a hard time controlling the
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:45.840]  information so they gotta have a cop with it with
[3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:49.200]  with a german shepherd and a gun marks towards a woman with her little boy
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:54.080]  now now now expanding on that um I want to take a call or two here I'm
[3:55:54.080 --> 3:55:58.160]  wish we had more time but unfortunately the show is basically over
[3:55:58.160 --> 3:56:01.440]  um but if you're a police officer government bureaucrat this is hurting
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:05.040]  your children too you're with the people I can understand how these control
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:08.720]  freaks in government relish lying enforcing vaccines
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:13.280]  well you know remember you know I remember when the Berlin wall went up
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:18.320]  and I remember when it fell and I remember when the guards were told to
[3:56:18.320 --> 3:56:23.200]  shoot the people who were trying to go over the Berlin wall
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:27.680]  and at some point they just laid down their guns and said
[3:56:27.680 --> 3:56:32.080]  we're not going to shoot anymore and you know I've always predicted that we
[3:56:32.080 --> 3:56:34.880]  were going to go through a period of great oppression
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:38.800]  before we are going to break through to to what I call an awakening which is why
[3:56:38.800 --> 3:56:43.360]  I call my bug a vaccine awakening I think that we may be entering a
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:47.840]  time where we will have oppression but but the people I believe in the power
[3:56:47.840 --> 3:56:50.640]  of the people I believe in their common sense and in their
[3:56:50.640 --> 3:56:54.000]  wisdom and ultimately they will do what they need to do
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:58.080]  to protect the entire biological integrity of themselves and their children
[3:56:58.080 --> 3:57:01.600]  because our children is all we have we have that is the future
[3:57:01.600 --> 3:57:06.400]  and we have the biological imperative it dictates that we must protect the
[3:57:06.400 --> 3:57:10.400]  genetic integrity of our children and biological integrity so I believe that
[3:57:10.400 --> 3:57:13.200]  people will ultimately win but I think they'll be a lot of suffering in
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:15.360]  between that's right in the mercury actually attacks the
[3:57:15.360 --> 3:57:18.400]  DNA that's what you're looking to I apologize to Linda Sarah
