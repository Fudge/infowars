[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.469]  You've got it, brother.
[00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.311]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:09.572]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.712]  Alright, you wanna go?
[00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:17.354]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.943]  We're good.
[00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:52.239]  We are broadcasting worldwide, blasting out on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave, and of course satellite number one on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for online streaming and podcasts.
[00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.620]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:05.010]  You have founded the tip of the spear, the front line in the InfoWar as we attempt, in some cases with great success, to alert free humanity to the dangers of historical tyranny.
[00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:14.255]  That is now manifesting itself and coming in like a flood against free peoples all over the world, not just here in the United States.
[00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:17.957]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, popping in for a segment or two.
[00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:20.538]  The start of the next hour is Aaron Dykes.
[00:01:21.238 --> 00:01:32.165]  Aaron and Darren McBreen, two of our great reporters, have spent the last few days during a big federal martial law takeover drill that included practicing rounding up citizens and putting them in a nearby sports stadium.
[00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:35.867]  We'll tell you the cover story the feds had for that one.
[00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:48.015]  It'll be popping up at the start of the next hour, also popping in a witness off and on the last week to the demonstrations in and around Wall Street culminating in people being beat up over the weekend and hundreds being arrested.
[00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:57.439]  That is all coming up today with Luke Rodowski joining us and reporting from fullworks.com from New York City, Lower Manhattan.
[00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.240]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.942]  Obviously, we've got an information overload here.
[00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:10.086]  And I'm not getting a lot into politics because most of these people are horses owned by the very same stable.
[00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:15.668]  Owned by the very same operation, the Globalists, like a Don King boxing match.
[00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:24.271]  But, we have a real contender in the arena, in this rigged game, who's not rigged, and so the system is pulling out the stops.
[00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:26.051]  Of course, his name is Ron Paul.
[00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:39.316]  But I think it's important to just go over a few of the dirty tricks they've run against him, and illustrate the fact that even the corporate shill media is admitting that the Tea Party, people who actually are constitutionalists,
[00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:43.446]  The Republicans have basically failed to co-opt it.
[00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:45.328]  Rick Perry has failed to co-opt it.
[00:02:45.328 --> 00:02:48.271]  And the Tea Party is destroying Rick Perry.
[00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:55.017]  He came out of the gates and was the frontrunner instantly because of media anointing him as the leader.
[00:02:55.017 --> 00:03:01.282]  But as soon as myself and Ron Paul and others said, did you know he was Al Gore's chief of staff?
[00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:02.783]  Did you know he supported Hillary Care?
[00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:04.705]  Did you know he went to Bilderberg?
[00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.789]  Did you know he supports handing over 8,000 miles of Texas roads?
[00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.831]  Did you know he's for forced inoculation?
[00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:12.073]  He has imploded.
[00:03:12.073 --> 00:03:16.899]  The problem is we've not completely destroyed him yet.
[00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:24.166]  We've also got to take out politically the other Ken doll who's just as bad or worse and that's Mitt Twinkle Toes.
[00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:26.349]  Romney.
[00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:35.514]  He is a clone of Rick Perry, except for the fact that he's from Michigan, not from Texas, and he has not attended Bilderberg, that we know.
[00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.210]  And he was on a male cheerleader.
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.294]  Normally, to be a Republican contender, you've got to be a male cheerleader as of late.
[00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:46.937]  Rick Perry, of course, is a male cheerleader, like George W. Bush and others.
[00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:53.461]  And Trent Lott and the rest of them, part of the Twinkle Toes pillow-biting club, or whatever they're part of.
[00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:55.123]  So, that's all coming up.
[00:03:55.123 --> 00:03:56.243]  We're going to break this down.
[00:03:56.243 --> 00:03:58.825]  And Time Magazine trying to prop him up.
[00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.267]  The rise of Rick Perry.
[00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:03.249]  Remember I told you Rick Perry was going to run when he pledged he wouldn't.
[00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:06.668]  And I told you that all this stuff would come out.
[00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:16.036]  That's why he told a Fox News host a year and a half ago that he's scared of Ron Paul and Alex Jones, because he knows we're carrying the data that can bring him down.
[00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:24.824]  Same thing on Newt Gingrich, who's not really a contender, but she's still discrediting Mr. Carbon Tax, Mr. Global Government.
[00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:28.067]  In fact, guys, will you Google for me?
[00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:36.332]  Because I've always been to bring in here is actually I don't actually own the Alvin Eide Toffler book that he intro recalls for world government.
[00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:41.894]  Something like Newt Gingrich called for global government in Toffler book intro.
[00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:42.555]  That should get it.
[00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:46.579]  He's also called for implanting the entire population with microchips.
[00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:47.099]  Don't believe me?
[00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.422]  Just type in Newt Gingrich, microchips.
[00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.144]  But back to Mitt Romney.
[00:04:51.144 --> 00:04:57.931]  He, of course, is... I'll tell you about him when we get back, but Mitt Romney's a big carbon tax supporter and the author of Obamacare.
[00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:04.499]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.740]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.922]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:18.943]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:21.164]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:22.024]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.024 --> 00:05:22.544]  Bernanke?
[00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:23.205]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:24.485]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:26.726]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:42.753]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:05:42.753 --> 00:05:47.897]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:47.897 --> 00:06:00.065]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:05.489]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:07.771]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:17.663]  Yeah.
[00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.961]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:38.043]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:42.486]  It is, of course, Sunday, the 25th day of September 2011.
[00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:46.409]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.370]  We're also going to have open phones.
[00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.452]  I want to get into some of the news, and I'll open the phones up.
[00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.434]  I want to take your calls throughout the next two hours.
[00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:58.758]  And we have Aaron Dykes, Infowars.com reporter, with some breaking news, joining us at the start of the next hour.
[00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:09.964]  We're also going to talk for a few minutes with Luke Rudowsky, who's been inside of those Wall Street demonstrations, where there have now been a whole bunch of different arrests taking place.
[00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:15.347]  We have the Daily Mail, as well as Reuters reporting that the euro has six weeks to live.
[00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:29.023]  If the countries that make up the euro in Europe do not give up all of their sovereignty to a quote financial union owned and run by the very same mega banks that sold those governments the worthless derivatives.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.482]  And they're holding Europe hostage, of course.
[00:07:33.482 --> 00:07:46.352]  If Europe gives in and waives what sovereignty it has left, even out of the euro itself, they of course will be further imploded, just like the big central banks have done in the third world over and over again.
[00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:53.137]  Here in the US, of course, the traders in both parties have transferred power to the new super congress that controls the power of the purse.
[00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:56.520]  An unprecedented event that's gotten almost no news coverage.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.202]  We live in incredible times as the private corporate
[00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:03.185]  Criminal world government openly establishes itself.
[00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:26.364]  Now before I get into the fall of Barack Obama and what could be the political fall of Rick Perry before he ever hatched out on the national stage and break down what happened at the Republican, the latest Republican debate with Herman Cain winning and a lot more in the Miami paper has the headline here
[00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:32.163]  Let me just give it to you because it's amazing.
[00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:33.584]  Rick Perry in deep trouble.
[00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:35.926]  That's the Miami Herald headline.
[00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:52.158]  Before I get into that and the establishment dinosaur corpse zombie walking corpse media that there's a big survey out today that the mainstream media is furthering and accelerating its hemorrhaging of viewers and readers.
[00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:54.279]  We crossed the Rubicon two and a half years ago.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:06.526]  According to a bunch of big university studies where the internet now has more viewers, more listeners, more readers going there for news than all the mainstream media combined, even with their internet footprint.
[00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:13.990]  Alternative is bigger than them, but that hemorrhaging has only accelerated as they continue to try to prop up people like Rick Perry.
[00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.972]  Here's the cover of Time Magazine, the rise of Rick Perry.
[00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:30.741]  So I'm, and quick fall if we get the word out on this guy, same thing with the other Ken Doll pretty boy, Mr. Carbon Tax, Mr. Obamacare, Mitt Romney.
[00:09:32.361 --> 00:09:35.424]  If we get the word out about what they really support, it's over for them.
[00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:48.715]  And you notice people are waking up now in a few weeks to these people, instead of taking a few years like Obama, or six, seven years with George W. Bush, or seven and a half years to wake up to Bill Clinton being a con artist.
[00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:51.158]  People are waking up to the game.
[00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:53.299]  That The Who has talked about.
[00:09:53.299 --> 00:10:16.646]  You know, I was driving in today listening to 93.7 LBJ, the local rock station, and listened to The Who song, Won't Get Fooled Again, and this was something, this was music that came out in 1971, and they're talking about the left-right paradigm, they're talking about the scams, they're talking about how it's a two-party dictatorship,
[00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:22.310]  But finally, decades and decades later, more and more people.
[00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.912]  Well, Congress has a 9% approval rating, the lowest in history.
[00:10:25.912 --> 00:10:28.293]  There is a political realignment happening.
[00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:29.993]  There is a great awakening.
[00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:34.715]  But just because you're awake doesn't mean you know exactly where you are.
[00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:38.656]  You ever woken up in the middle of the night in a hotel room and you wonder where you are?
[00:10:38.656 --> 00:10:41.558]  Takes you a few seconds to go, oh, I'm out of town.
[00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:46.779]  I'm in New Mexico, or I'm in California, or I'm in New York, or I'm in South Texas.
[00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:47.440]  I'm in Illinois.
[00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:50.429]  You're not at home, you know, back in Kansas anymore.
[00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:51.890]  That's the same thing.
[00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.972]  People are awake now, but that doesn't mean they figured out exactly what's going on.
[00:10:56.972 --> 00:11:01.734]  But at least now they'll listen and understand this global criminal takeover.
[00:11:01.734 --> 00:11:06.356]  I mean, listen to the words from Won't Get Fooled Again by The Who.
[00:11:06.356 --> 00:11:14.840]  First, maybe if you're younger or older and don't know who The Who are, I should play a clip of this song to remind you.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.160]  Here it is.
[00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:20.880]  You've heard that before.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:34.988]  All right, we're going to come back after the break and actually play some of the pertinent sections from the piece about meet the new boss, same as the old boss, won't get fooled again.
[00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:36.989]  But I wanted to remind you of the hoop.
[00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:42.613]  By the way, Jaron was down at his favorite place to watch soccer on television.
[00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:44.794]  You don't mind if I say where you go watch soccer, do you, Jaron?
[00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:47.404]  He loves it.
[00:11:47.404 --> 00:11:48.385]  Fido's down there.
[00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:50.387]  He's always trying to get me to go down there.
[00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:51.368]  And guess who was there?
[00:11:51.368 --> 00:11:53.069]  Robert Plant!
[00:11:53.069 --> 00:12:00.517]  And I almost could strangle Jaren for not going up with his iPhone, his producer phone, and shooting quick interview with Robert Plant.
[00:12:00.517 --> 00:12:01.699]  Nobody was bugging him in there.
[00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:03.919]  Most people didn't even know who he was.
[00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.240]  I guess he owns one of the teams.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.600]  His team was losing the team he was watching.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.161]  And Jaron didn't go over and talk to Robert Plant.
[00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:15.042]  And then Jaron pointed out, well, my iPhone's so old, the producer iPhone is so old, it doesn't shoot video.
[00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:17.003]  So I have to get a new producer phone.
[00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:29.086]  But side issue that got brought up, I heard Jeff Ward on Local 590 AM this week saying that he talked to a cab driver who saw, who had Robert Plant in his car.
[00:12:29.386 --> 00:12:34.668]  I don't know why Robert Plant's here in town, and quite frankly, at the end of the day, he's a great musician, but I really don't care.
[00:12:34.668 --> 00:12:37.310]  I just brought it up because we're talking about rock and roll.
[00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.912]  Listen to the words of this song before I come back and get into what's really happening with the 2012 presidential campaign.
[00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:45.513]  Obama, Rick Perry, all of them.
[00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:47.134]  They're all in the same camp.
[00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:48.594]  Different parties, same camp.
[00:12:48.594 --> 00:12:50.935]  Only one guy stands outside of it.
[00:12:50.935 --> 00:12:52.976]  But listen to this.
[00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:53.497]  These words.
[00:12:53.497 --> 00:12:54.597]  Won't get fooled again.
[00:12:54.597 --> 00:12:55.858]  The who?
[00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.539]  We'll be fighting in the streets with our children at our feet.
[00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:04.085]  And the morals that they worship will be gone.
[00:13:04.085 --> 00:13:11.952]  And the men who spurred us on said in judgment of all wrong, they decide and the shotgun sings the song.
[00:13:11.952 --> 00:13:13.374]  Talk about revolution.
[00:13:13.374 --> 00:13:21.201]  I'll tip my hat to the new constitution, I'll take a bow for the new revolution, smile and grin at the change all around me, the hope and change.
[00:13:21.942 --> 00:13:23.045]  It's 1971.
[00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:27.796]  Pick up my guitar and play just like yesterday and I'll get on my knees and pray.
[00:13:27.796 --> 00:13:29.440]  We won't get fooled again.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.523]  Don't get fooled again.
[00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:33.201]  Change, it had to come.
[00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:38.083]  We knew it all along, but we were liberated from the fall, that's all.
[00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:45.545]  But the world looks just the same and history ain't changed because the banners, they were all flown in the last war.
[00:13:45.545 --> 00:13:49.046]  They're always fighting the last war, not the new, the new con game.
[00:13:49.046 --> 00:13:54.008]  You think of a dictator as Hitler or Stalin and Mao, not as a bureaucracy, not as a banking cartel.
[00:13:55.854 --> 00:14:10.619]  I'll tip my hat to the new constitution, take a bow for the new revolution, smile and grin at the change all around me, pick up my guitar and play just like yesterday, and I'll get on my knees and pray we won't get fooled again, don't get fooled again, no, no.
[00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:17.562]  By the way, I have confirmed from folks that most of the Who are huge fans of the show, and if you're listening out there, you ought to come on the show.
[00:14:17.562 --> 00:14:24.164]  Of course, there's even folks in rock bigger than the Who who I've talked to who are listeners but won't come on.
[00:14:25.863 --> 00:14:32.546]  Continuing here, I'll move myself and my family aside if we happen to be left half alive.
[00:14:32.546 --> 00:14:39.649]  I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky, for I know that the hypnotized never die, do ya?
[00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:42.730]  And it doesn't sound as good when I'm speaking it, sorry folks.
[00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:54.195]  There's nothing in the street that looks any different to me, and the slogans are replaced by the by, and the parting on the left is now the parting on the right,
[00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:59.372]  And the beards have all grown longer overnight.
[00:14:59.372 --> 00:15:01.494]  I'll tip my hat to the new constitution.
[00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:04.115]  I'll take a bow for the new revolution.
[00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:06.397]  Smile and grin at the change all around me.
[00:15:06.397 --> 00:15:08.779]  Pick up my guitar and play just like yesterday.
[00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:12.421]  Then I'll get on my knees and pray we don't get fooled again.
[00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:13.442]  Don't get fooled again.
[00:15:13.442 --> 00:15:14.703]  No, no.
[00:15:14.703 --> 00:15:15.844]  Yeah!
[00:15:15.844 --> 00:15:18.265]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:20.567]  Folks, do you like being conned?
[00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:23.349]  Do you enjoy being screwed around?
[00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:34.519]  There's one person in the 2012 race who's being attacked by MSNBC and Fox, by CNN and CNBC.
[00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:41.465]  There's one guy in every debate who, when he wins the poll, MSNBC didn't show it and Fox didn't either.
[00:15:41.465 --> 00:15:47.971]  There's one guy that they dubbed booing over whenever he won the CPAC poll two years in a row.
[00:15:47.971 --> 00:15:49.052]  His name's Ron Paul.
[00:15:49.753 --> 00:15:53.738]  We're gonna talk about Rick, Slimeball, Perry, all of them straight ahead.
[00:15:53.738 --> 00:15:58.605]  We're gonna talk about Obama and how pathetic he is and how I told you he would implode.
[00:16:02.213 --> 00:16:06.174]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:15.037]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:19.658]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:16:19.658 --> 00:16:30.481]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:40.623]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:16:40.623 --> 00:16:46.065]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:53.546]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:56.307]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.401]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:08.326]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:10.888]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:16.052]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:19.293]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:17:19.293 --> 00:17:21.614]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:27.856]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:31.237]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:37.019]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:38.660]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.800]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.623]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:17:42.623 --> 00:17:46.848]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:51.474]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:54.077]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:57.081]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:17:57.081 --> 00:17:57.701]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:04.445]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:18:04.445 --> 00:18:05.365]  Number one.
[00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:08.786]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:09.646]  Number two.
[00:18:09.646 --> 00:18:14.547]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:18:14.547 --> 00:18:15.287]  It's true.
[00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:20.148]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:18:20.148 --> 00:18:20.988]  Number three.
[00:18:20.988 --> 00:18:24.569]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:28.250]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.271]  Number 4.
[00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:32.033]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:35.717]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:18:35.717 --> 00:18:36.498]  Number 5.
[00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:40.661]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:45.406]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:18:45.706 --> 00:18:49.870]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.651]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:53.913]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:18:53.913 --> 00:18:56.735]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:18:56.735 --> 00:19:01.319]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:04.482]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Schenck and eFoods Direct.
[00:19:04.762 --> 00:19:07.324]  I have e-foods for my own emergency food supply.
[00:19:07.324 --> 00:19:10.387]  You know, Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[00:19:10.387 --> 00:19:11.187]  Very different.
[00:19:11.187 --> 00:19:21.136]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season, and we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[00:19:21.136 --> 00:19:23.398]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:27.501]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:31.084]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's minds.
[00:19:31.144 --> 00:19:37.509]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.350]  So everyone needs food security.
[00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.253]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect.
[00:19:43.253 --> 00:19:46.496]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.
[00:19:46.496 --> 00:19:52.801]  Get stocked up with the best storable foods out there with eFoodsDirect and be prepared for any emergency before it happens.
[00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:55.563]  To take advantage of this special call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:20:01.198 --> 00:20:02.719]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:04.780]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.983]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:36.073 --> 00:20:48.920]  That's right, all of these fools ran from George W. Bush when he was leaving office.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.021]  To Barack Obama.
[00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:57.183]  And if you would have voted for McCain, you would have been going to another establishment, bought and paid for individual.
[00:20:57.183 --> 00:21:01.284]  When you actually look at their policies, there's almost no difference.
[00:21:01.284 --> 00:21:03.845]  There's a difference in delivery and style.
[00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:11.888]  But in the final equation, modern American presidents are puppets of the bureaucracy and of the special interests that are put into power.
[00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:16.610]  Now, I know what I'm saying here today is no revelation.
[00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:22.853]  I know that probably over 90% of you are saying, really, Alex, tell us something we don't know.
[00:21:22.853 --> 00:21:24.173]  What are you going to tell us next?
[00:21:24.173 --> 00:21:29.035]  That birds sing, that water's wet, that the sky is blue?
[00:21:29.035 --> 00:21:32.077]  Okay, well, okay, so you know this.
[00:21:32.077 --> 00:21:39.640]  Well, then why is Mitt Romney right now the frontrunner with Rick Perry second and Ron Paul third?
[00:21:41.212 --> 00:21:47.994]  Why are two dyed-in-the-wool establishment hacks in power?
[00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:49.234]  Let me go one further.
[00:21:49.234 --> 00:21:57.076]  Why don't Democrats love Rick Perry and love Mitt Romney?
[00:21:57.076 --> 00:22:02.117]  I mean, they're for torture, they're for wars, they're for big government.
[00:22:02.117 --> 00:22:07.238]  They're bought and paid for by the very same big Wall Street interests that get the trillions in corporate welfare.
[00:22:07.238 --> 00:22:09.939]  I mean, if you really look at who finances all these people,
[00:22:11.954 --> 00:22:13.655]  That's what I used to tell Democrats.
[00:22:13.655 --> 00:22:26.819]  I said, look, you should love George Bush because the very same special interests that are financing your political party are financing him.
[00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:37.462]  And I told Democrats, I said, you're going to love Obama, even though he's going to continue everything Bush did, because that's who the very same special interests are putting money into.
[00:22:37.462 --> 00:22:38.863]  This is not rocket science.
[00:22:40.191 --> 00:22:44.453]  And so the Republican and Democratic leadership will act like they're fighting with each other.
[00:22:44.453 --> 00:23:01.742]  But when you get down to a case like Ron Paul, and I was driving in listening to local radio today and I heard a host asking his listeners, why are you saying Ron Paul is a first-tier when he came in fifth or whatever it was in Florida?
[00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:09.087]  Why do you guys keep insisting he can win, and I heard a few callers who really couldn't articulate things.
[00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:13.388]  Let me articulate things for everybody out there, okay?
[00:23:13.388 --> 00:23:20.011]  Ron Paul has won the two coveted CPAC polls in a row by record percentages.
[00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:25.754]  That is a Republican straw poll of the real Republican faithful.
[00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:35.480]  He got standing ovations when he spoke about non-interventionism and true libertarian constitutionalism, that you can call conservatism.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.561]  It's all just labels.
[00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:39.343]  The point is, he's a steadfast.
[00:23:39.343 --> 00:23:46.667]  And this year, when he won, Fox News dubbed booing over it, and got caught and said it was an accident.
[00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:52.731]  Ron Paul has won the New Hampshire, statistically, because he's bought 4,000 votes, that's admitted.
[00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.712]  He won the Iowa.
[00:23:54.712 --> 00:23:55.793]  He won the California.
[00:23:56.741 --> 00:24:02.705]  He won most of the other states, or came in second or third place.
[00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:04.766]  But that isn't what matters.
[00:24:04.766 --> 00:24:09.630]  Even though Ronald Reagan won those polls, and even though Ronald Reagan won the CPAC, that's all somewhat important.
[00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:16.094]  What is important is, he is the second biggest collector of money under Mitt Romney.
[00:24:16.094 --> 00:24:20.797]  And it's small donations on average, less than 50 bucks, when Mitt Romney's are in the thousands.
[00:24:20.797 --> 00:24:24.220]  You can go look it up at the Federal Elections Commission.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.781]  They're going to be filing more of those numbers soon.
[00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.871]  So, number one, he's a big earner.
[00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:32.091]  A big collector of money.
[00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:33.631]  And it's coming from grassroots.
[00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:37.512]  He's gotten over 70% of all military donations combined.
[00:24:37.512 --> 00:24:38.933]  You can just search that term.
[00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:40.733]  Ron Paul gets majority of military donations.
[00:24:40.733 --> 00:24:42.874]  You'll get Politico, Associated Press.
[00:24:42.874 --> 00:24:45.714]  But again, buried in the back of the news.
[00:24:45.714 --> 00:24:48.615]  He gets more than all Republicans and Obama combined.
[00:24:48.615 --> 00:24:48.935]  Ron Paul.
[00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:57.442]  Ron Paul, in every scientific poll I've seen, comes in first, second, or third place.
[00:24:57.442 --> 00:25:08.410]  That's why Ron Paul, in the Republican debate earlier in the week, not the last one in Florida, said, I am... Maybe it was the latest one, they all run together.
[00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:15.215]  I actually have been watching them, not live, but on the web, and we post them on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:16.032 --> 00:25:21.074]  I tend to skip through some of the lower tier candidates, but I've been watching most of it.
[00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:29.937]  And Ron Paul says himself he's a number three candidate, and undoubtedly he's number three.
[00:25:29.937 --> 00:25:34.718]  Now, I was going to do a report on this on the InfoWars Nightly News Friday, but didn't have time.
[00:25:34.718 --> 00:25:36.199]  It's actually in there on Newsdesk.
[00:25:36.199 --> 00:25:38.080]  I should have had it for the break.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.941]  But several news publications broke down the numbers.
[00:25:43.414 --> 00:25:45.795]  And Dew was checking it and found them to be accurate.
[00:25:45.795 --> 00:25:59.318]  Ron Paul, out of all the candidates, in the last three debates, Republican debates, has gotten the least amount of time in questions and in answers.
[00:25:59.318 --> 00:26:04.700]  The last one I saw was like Romney was like 13 minutes and Ron Paul was four and a half.
[00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:08.057]  Perry was what, like nine minutes?
[00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:15.023]  I mean, this is so obvious that they run this hoax, Ron Paul can't win, Ron Paul can't win.
[00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:27.252]  Even Jon Stewart a month ago helped break the hoax, finally, and showed a compilation of four different TV networks, all saying the exact same thing about Ron Paul can't win, or when he had second place, mentioning first and third.
[00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:29.914]  I hear the conservative radio networks do the same thing.
[00:26:29.914 --> 00:26:31.956]  Local radio, it is a talking point.
[00:26:32.898 --> 00:26:35.260]  Now, local talk show hosts aren't getting a talking point.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:45.347]  They regurgitate what the national talk show hosts say, a lot of them knowing they'll go up the corporate ladder from the establishment if they show themselves to be yes-men and women.
[00:26:45.347 --> 00:26:58.736]  But others are just weak-minded and just kind of think repeating what's on the Sunday news shows, yeah, well, those are the experts on TV, so if I regurgitate their pap talking points, that makes me sound like I'm really smart.
[00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:00.858]  No, no.
[00:27:00.858 --> 00:27:06.401]  It's about getting outside the box, off the reservation, off the plantation.
[00:27:06.401 --> 00:27:10.343]  So, if... In fact, I'm going to have Paul Watson do this tomorrow.
[00:27:10.343 --> 00:27:21.269]  I'm going to call Paul Watson before I even get off air today, and I'm going to ask him to write a big article tomorrow chronicling the dirty tricks against Ron Paul that have been run just the last six months.
[00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:25.171]  And it is mind-blowing how many of them.
[00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:25.711]  But just
[00:27:27.526 --> 00:27:33.092]  Something we did confirm in Drudge Report linked to our article about this Friday.
[00:27:33.092 --> 00:27:37.978]  Fox News pulls poll showing Ron Paul debate victory.
[00:27:37.978 --> 00:27:39.980]  Claims Mitt Romney won.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.485]  When they close the poll out, Ron Paul beating by right at double.
[00:27:45.632 --> 00:27:52.837]  By 11,000 votes, and it's geolocated, you can only vote once with an IP address, and this happens at every poll.
[00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:57.721]  I've seen some where he gets more than double, where he has like 62% in the last NBC poll.
[00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:02.464]  62% of all the others had 30-something, and then they wouldn't even mention him.
[00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:08.929]  Wall Street Journal two weeks ago had a poll where he got over 40%, and it showed all the other candidates, and it said other candidate, which was Ron Paul.
[00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:13.731]  And then everybody commenting under the thing said, we know what you're doing, Wall Street Journal.
[00:28:13.731 --> 00:28:18.433]  It's liberal, it's conservative, but they're all flavors of the same establishment, Kool-Aid.
[00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:21.694]  You ever wonder why Gatorade has like 20 different flavors?
[00:28:21.694 --> 00:28:23.215]  It's so they take up shelf space.
[00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:26.968]  It's the same thing with the Republicans and Democrats.
[00:28:26.968 --> 00:28:31.950]  They just want to make you think you're getting choices, but it all comes from the same company.
[00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.792]  Like a Don King fight, where Don King owns both the fighters.
[00:28:35.792 --> 00:28:36.812]  Here it is.
[00:28:36.812 --> 00:28:40.473]  Fox News poll shows Ron Paul debate victory.
[00:28:40.473 --> 00:28:43.655]  Pulls the poll, but not before we screenshotted it and saved it.
[00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:48.317]  And then put up an article saying, in its place, that Mitt Romney had won.
[00:28:48.717 --> 00:28:51.301]  We're going to tell you about that and take your call straight ahead.

[00:29:03.133 --> 00:29:08.459]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:09.981]  Saving means to make money.

[00:29:27.037 --> 00:29:35.042]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:29:35.042 --> 00:29:40.285]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:30:04.227 --> 00:30:05.487]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.487 --> 00:30:09.028]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.028 --> 00:30:11.829]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:11.829 --> 00:30:17.511]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:24.193]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.193 --> 00:30:30.175]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.175 --> 00:30:33.816]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.356 --> 00:30:38.619]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:44.583]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.583 --> 00:30:48.125]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.125 --> 00:30:50.106]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.106 --> 00:30:51.227]  It's here.

[00:31:29.229 --> 00:31:33.984]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:33.984 --> 00:31:37.053]  Blue diamond gusset's got it.
[00:31:39.032 --> 00:31:41.173]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:31:57.543 --> 00:31:58.043]  Others don't.
[00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:01.166]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:04.609]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:07.192]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[00:32:07.192 --> 00:32:10.254]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[00:32:10.254 --> 00:32:11.055]  Very different.
[00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:14.558]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[00:32:14.858 --> 00:32:20.999]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:23.240]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.360]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.001]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:37.362]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[00:32:37.362 --> 00:32:39.222]  So everyone needs food security.
[00:32:39.222 --> 00:32:42.923]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoods Direct.

[00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:02.900]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.942]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:08.165]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:20.638 --> 00:33:22.858]  I was a highway man.
[00:33:22.858 --> 00:33:25.219]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:33:25.219 --> 00:33:29.080]  Sword and pistol by my side.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.380]  Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.381]  Who is this, Bill Clinton?
[00:33:37.381 --> 00:33:38.921]  You can trust me, I'm good.
[00:33:38.921 --> 00:33:41.962]  Global warming's real, pay Al Gore money.
[00:33:41.962 --> 00:33:43.842]  Alright, we are back live.
[00:33:43.842 --> 00:33:48.183]  Look, if you want to understand what's going on with Ron Paul and what's happening in this campaign,
[00:33:49.612 --> 00:33:50.412]  It's very simple.
[00:33:50.412 --> 00:33:56.914]  You saw the entire establishment, Pepsi, the big corporations, get behind Obama.
[00:33:56.914 --> 00:34:03.735]  You saw Wall Street give him four times the money, in some cases five times the money they gave John McCain.
[00:34:03.735 --> 00:34:13.477]  Not that John McCain was good, but that the establishment thought, hey, this guy can sell our baloney better than Obama.
[00:34:15.871 --> 00:34:20.393]  Or this guy cannot sell the baloney as well as Obama.
[00:34:20.393 --> 00:34:23.455]  I was having a Freudian slip because I was about to say next.
[00:34:23.455 --> 00:34:27.197]  Now the establishment is sick and tired of Obama.
[00:34:27.197 --> 00:34:33.800]  So you've seen the Chicago Tribune, the Washington Post, all these editorials coming out saying, don't run again, Obama.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:43.705]  Give us a fresh face in the Democratic primaries so that people get bought into the new personality and believing that this new Superman will save us.
[00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:49.408]  It's part of being conned over and over again.
[00:34:49.408 --> 00:35:09.321]  And so, what I'm getting at here is when you see the establishment get behind a George W. Bush, or get behind a Barack H. Obama, or get behind a Ricky Perry, you know, the Ricky Bobby of Texas, when you see that, that right there is the illustration of this is who you don't want to vote for.
[00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:09.922]  Rick Perry,
[00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:17.066]  And Mitt Romney have not won one single straw poll.
[00:35:17.066 --> 00:35:21.007]  They weren't even the frontrunners months ago when the media would add them into the polls.
[00:35:21.007 --> 00:35:23.507]  But the media kept saying they were the frontrunners.
[00:35:23.507 --> 00:35:24.567]  They were the winners.
[00:35:24.567 --> 00:35:29.628]  And so some weak-minded people start to think, well, that's who they say I can vote for.
[00:35:29.628 --> 00:35:33.929]  It's kind of like showing up at the store and saying, I want to rent this DVD.
[00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:35.910]  And they say, sorry, we're out of that movie.
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.970]  OK, well, what else you got?
[00:35:38.806 --> 00:35:42.208]  They told you you had to vote for Mitt Romney or Rick Perry.
[00:35:42.208 --> 00:35:53.436]  They told you on every show and every program that the race was down to them and then said too bad Ron Paul can't win when in every poll he's been first, second or third.
[00:35:53.436 --> 00:35:55.838]  Most polls he's been second or third.
[00:35:55.838 --> 00:36:06.085]  If you don't believe me just type Ron Paul comes in first in Rasmussen poll or type in Ron Paul comes in second in Mason Dixon or Ron Paul comes in third in Gallup.
[00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:18.370]  In fact, we're going to show you, if you're watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, we're streaming the show, we can put it on screen before we play this video clip, just a Google search of Ron Paul, third place.
[00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:25.257]  And you'll get Rasmussen, you'll get Gallup, you will see all of those numbers right there.
[00:36:25.257 --> 00:36:27.579]  In fact, I had it up during the break, that's how I know that we...
[00:36:28.643 --> 00:36:30.404]  I don't know why he didn't win!
[00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:52.719]  I don't know why people are saying he can't win.
[00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:54.780]  Again, it's this mindset.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.621]  I guess we're gonna go ahead and go to some phone calls here.
[00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:06.443]  Look, the issue here, ladies and gentlemen, is that it's time to stop being conned.
[00:37:06.443 --> 00:37:10.024]  It's time to realize what's happening.
[00:37:10.024 --> 00:37:14.946]  It's time to just have fundamental common sense.
[00:37:16.004 --> 00:37:20.787]  That's all this is, is fundamental common sense.
[00:37:20.787 --> 00:37:32.274]  That when Rachel Maddow on the fake left is attacking Ron Paul, and when Sean Hannity on the controlled right is attacking Ron Paul, and when all these other candidates
[00:37:33.948 --> 00:37:34.368]  Are you kidding me?
[00:37:53.614 --> 00:37:56.515]  And they said, well, too bad that this team can't win.
[00:37:56.515 --> 00:38:08.960]  Too bad the Patriots can't win because they're only number three and there are plenty of games left for them to be able to get into the position of number one.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.081]  I mean, even when somebody's number one, you don't say that it's impossible for them to lose.
[00:38:14.081 --> 00:38:17.143]  In fact, there it is on screen.
[00:38:17.143 --> 00:38:20.164]  Ron Paul, I'm trying to change the course of history.
[00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:20.724]  Ron Paul.
[00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:26.422]  Yeah, yeah, see, earlier I was in there and I just did the search, uh, Ron Paul in third place.
[00:38:26.422 --> 00:38:30.006]  Like, I'll do it on this computer in here, and then we can do a document cam shot that way.
[00:38:30.006 --> 00:38:30.827]  Watch this.
[00:38:30.827 --> 00:38:33.930]  I'm gonna show viewers this right here on the screen, okay?
[00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:39.436]  Ron Paul in third place.
[00:38:40.922 --> 00:38:43.483]  It's all right there for anybody that wants to go look at it
[00:39:03.663 --> 00:39:05.405]  There it is, Rasmussen.
[00:39:05.405 --> 00:39:07.407]  That's Gallup Poll saying the same thing.
[00:39:07.407 --> 00:39:08.948]  Ron Paul, third place.
[00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:12.231]  Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Ron Paul.
[00:39:12.231 --> 00:39:15.754]  Rick Perry was 17%, Ron Paul was 14.
[00:39:15.754 --> 00:39:17.456]  And what's the source on that?
[00:39:17.456 --> 00:39:18.777]  USA Today.
[00:39:18.777 --> 00:39:24.462]  I mean, this is so elementary that it makes my head spin sometimes.
[00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:45.806]  That you've got a guy who has come in first, second, or third in every scientific poll of hundreds and hundreds I've seen, who wins all the spontaneous internet polls, that I believe are even more scientific because you can only vote once according to your IP address, who's winning every one of those, usually in double digits.
[00:39:45.806 --> 00:39:48.868]  In fact, in every case by double, or right at double.
[00:39:48.868 --> 00:39:54.012]  And they're saying, sorry he can't win, sorry he's not a choice, sorry he's not a contender.
[00:39:55.469 --> 00:40:02.074]  That'd be like if there was a guy in Formula One racing who had won races coming second and third and a bunch of others.
[00:40:02.074 --> 00:40:23.710]  They're in the pole position, out of the gates, and with 80% of the race to go, they're in third place, and their car is picking up steam, running great, and they say it's too bad that the Marlboro car, or the Jack Daniels car, or whatever it is, or the Chevy car, too bad that car can't win.
[00:40:26.274 --> 00:40:29.298]  And you're like, but they've got all these laps to go.
[00:40:29.298 --> 00:40:35.185]  The race isn't even half over and he's in third place and he's gaining on the other car.
[00:40:35.185 --> 00:40:39.430]  They go, sorry, doesn't count, can't win, can't look at that candidate.
[00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:44.336]  And the whole system then, all the commentators start attacking him and saying how horrible they are.
[00:40:45.307 --> 00:40:54.952]  Now, see, in a race like that, some politics can come in, taking points away or whatever they do, but at the end of the day, it's about the driver and the car.
[00:40:54.952 --> 00:41:02.557]  But in this case, you're voters, and so they're manipulating you, saying, uh-oh, he's pulled up to third place from way back at the back.
[00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:03.917]  Oh, he's not a contender.
[00:41:03.917 --> 00:41:04.718]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:04.718 --> 00:41:06.319]  Don't even look at that car.
[00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.120]  And then, when he does win the races,
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:15.852]  When he does get right at double the votes Mitt Romney got at the Fox News poll, they just pull the stinking thing when the Drugs Report links to it.
[00:41:18.717 --> 00:41:21.719]  And then we write an article about it and it gets national attention.
[00:41:21.719 --> 00:41:23.700]  This is what's so frustrating.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.882]  It is a total and complete mind game.
[00:41:26.882 --> 00:41:28.723]  Jaron was able to find this video clip.
[00:41:28.723 --> 00:41:30.484]  This is from the last debate.
[00:41:30.484 --> 00:41:33.266]  Ron Paul saying, well, I'm number three now.
[00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:35.187]  I'm the third contender.
[00:41:35.187 --> 00:41:36.368]  And he's being humble.
[00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:42.232]  He could have quoted scores of polls, Scientific, Gallup, you name it, with him in second.
[00:41:42.232 --> 00:41:45.013]  You can type in like I just typed in Ron Paul in third place.
[00:41:45.013 --> 00:41:47.555]  And I just showed you Gallup and Rasmussen.
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.421]  I just typed it in, in front of you, and it came up.
[00:41:51.421 --> 00:41:54.101]  I can type in, Ron Paul gets first place in the scientific poll.
[00:41:54.101 --> 00:41:55.841]  I can type in, Ron Paul gets second place.
[00:41:55.841 --> 00:41:57.882]  The point is, let's just say he's third place.
[00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:06.684]  Let's just go ahead with the majority of the polls, he's in third place, but they're telling you that he cannot win too bad, it's Mitt Romney or Rick Perry.
[00:42:06.684 --> 00:42:17.826]  The truth is, if real Americans and constitutionalists who want to get out of this banking crisis, who want to get out of the UN, who want to get rid of all these federal agencies, who want to go back to being what America was and move forward.
[00:42:18.925 --> 00:42:26.821]  If you want to get rid of the private Federal Reserve banking cartel, if you want to restore the Republic, you've got to vote for Ron Paul!
[00:42:26.821 --> 00:42:30.208]  Instead they have this mind game of, too bad he can't win, he's in third place.
[00:42:31.425 --> 00:42:34.486]  We're gonna come back from break with that video clip and then I'll go to your phone calls.
[00:42:34.486 --> 00:42:35.886]  I'm about to have an embolism here.
[00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.507]  It makes me so mad.
[00:42:37.507 --> 00:42:48.470]  It makes me so angry that they must sit there when we've got a chance to get the executive branch, which won't fix everything, but could really start to turn things around, right when this country desperately needs it.
[00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:58.453]  A guy who understands the New World Order, a guy who understands the Bilderberg Group that Rick Perry goes to, a guy that understands corporate cronyism, and they're telling you you can't have him.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:16.827]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:20.509]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:43:21.516 --> 00:43:34.288]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:43:34.288 --> 00:43:41.555]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:43:42.236 --> 00:43:52.624]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:43:52.624 --> 00:43:56.546]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:59.649]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:44:01.658 --> 00:44:06.363]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:44:06.363 --> 00:44:12.790]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.053]  Number one, study the past.
[00:44:15.053 --> 00:44:17.455]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:44:17.455 --> 00:44:21.179]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:44:22.307 --> 00:44:25.390]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.233]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:38.300]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.703]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:44:41.703 --> 00:44:45.346]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:44:46.187 --> 00:44:51.111]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:44:51.111 --> 00:44:55.735]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:57.896]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:45:01.055 --> 00:45:02.777]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:45:02.777 --> 00:45:08.083]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:09.625]  Saving means to make money.
[00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:18.415]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:26.680]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:34.685]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:45:34.685 --> 00:45:39.907]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:45:39.907 --> 00:45:42.069]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.052]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:45:48.052 --> 00:45:50.433]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:45:50.433 --> 00:45:52.555]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:45:59.677 --> 00:46:00.858]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:46:00.858 --> 00:46:07.784]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:46:07.784 --> 00:46:10.346]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:46:10.346 --> 00:46:15.730]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.773]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:46:18.773 --> 00:46:21.074]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:46:21.074 --> 00:46:27.339]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:46:27.339 --> 00:46:27.760]  In fact,
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:28.701]  I don't know.
[00:46:49.102 --> 00:46:50.923]  End of America 3.com.
[00:46:50.923 --> 00:46:53.505]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:46:53.505 --> 00:46:57.387]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:46:57.387 --> 00:47:01.369]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:47:01.369 --> 00:47:02.890]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.951]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.951 --> 00:47:08.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:14.466 --> 00:47:24.035]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:24.035 --> 00:47:29.800]  Okay, folks, we don't screen your calls and we've got more than a score of them there holding.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.683]  I want to go to you.
[00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:38.709]  I don't know what I can say to you today about Ron Paul to
[00:47:40.663 --> 00:47:45.025]  Get you angry enough to get the word out to stop this hoax.
[00:47:45.025 --> 00:47:51.928]  And we've already seen the fact that the media was ignoring him when he was in second and third place and not mentioning him as a candidate.
[00:47:51.928 --> 00:47:55.189]  That blew up a month ago in their face.
[00:47:55.189 --> 00:48:00.711]  And now they're back to just scrubbing him from polls, he wins and other things.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:01.672]  But it's a big deal.
[00:48:02.731 --> 00:48:09.575]  And I even hear Ron Paul's supporters saying, too bad he can't win, too bad he's not a top-tier candidate buying the propaganda.
[00:48:09.575 --> 00:48:12.597]  And that's why this country is where we are now.
[00:48:12.597 --> 00:48:17.600]  Ron Paul is the only candidate that can beat Barack Obama.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.543]  In fact, they've done major focus groups, ballot polls, you can pull them up.
[00:48:21.543 --> 00:48:29.268]  Ron Paul performs the best in a head-to-head run right now with voters across the board
[00:48:31.035 --> 00:48:37.009]  He performs the best against Barack Obama, beating him hands down.
[00:48:37.009 --> 00:48:39.454]  They first did these polls six months ago and he was neck and neck.
[00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:50.596]  What's going to happen with a Mitt Romney or a Rick Perry is they're going to get into the campaign, all the dirt's going to come out on them, and Barack Obama's going to end up being president again.
[00:48:50.596 --> 00:48:51.417]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:48:51.417 --> 00:49:02.284]  In fact, it's almost better that Barack Obama be president instead of Mitt Romney or Rick Perry, because they're all working for the same globalist, anti-American interest.
[00:49:02.284 --> 00:49:10.169]  And Obama will have spent all his political capital, be absolutely hated, and probably get impeached down the road if he gets reelected.
[00:49:11.377 --> 00:49:20.962]  With a Mitt Romney or a Rick Perry, it'll be forget about all the stuff Obama did just like they did with Bush and it'll take time to expose the new person as a puppet.
[00:49:20.962 --> 00:49:27.665]  That's why it's so essential now to expose Rick Perry and Mitt Romney's real record.
[00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:29.646]  And we've been doing that with Rick Perry.
[00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.280]  I've talked to Ron Paul on and off air.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:49.150]  You notice he's gone after Rick Perry for supporting carbon taxes, and supporting gun control, and supporting Napa superhighways, and supporting forced inoculations, and being Al Gore's chief of staff in Texas, and supporting Hillarycare.
[00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:50.250]  Oh, you're a new listener?
[00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.891]  You didn't know all those things?
[00:49:51.891 --> 00:50:00.817]  I would tell people those things two years ago about Rick Perry nationally, because I'm syndicated around the country, and people would call me saying I was a liar.
[00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:07.341]  Now they finally went and looked it up and people are like, whoa!
[00:50:07.341 --> 00:50:09.722]  Well, let's move on from McPerry for a moment.
[00:50:09.722 --> 00:50:19.065]  Mitt Romney supports and is praised by Al Gore for supporting carbon taxes that will end industry as we know it in this country.
[00:50:19.065 --> 00:50:21.166]  What's left of it?
[00:50:21.166 --> 00:50:27.968]  Wrote the book, actually wrote the Massachusetts health care law that is the Obama model for health care.
[00:50:29.269 --> 00:50:38.546]  And I've got to see all these dyed-in-the-wool, blue-haired type Republicans getting off on Mitt Romney because he's an effeminate Ken doll type.
[00:50:39.588 --> 00:50:51.995]  I mean, can't we have somebody that isn't one of these metrosexual pretty boys with their hair cut just right, and they look like Ken Doll up there, and male cheerleaders like Rick Perry with that fake good old boy thing?
[00:50:51.995 --> 00:50:53.296]  I mean, it makes me want to throw up.
[00:50:53.296 --> 00:51:02.281]  And every time I watch Rick Perry saddling up to some old lady and, you know, telling her, how you doing, sweetie pie, and using some fake charm on her, it makes me want to throw up.
[00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:04.182]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:07.805]  This is Ron Paul in the last debate being asked, who's your running mate going to be?
[00:51:07.805 --> 00:51:11.068]  And Ron Paul says, well, I am now in the polls number three.
[00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:14.211]  So as soon as I'm number one or number two, I'll announce who my running mate will be.
[00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:15.032]  Think about it.
[00:51:15.032 --> 00:51:21.598]  The establishment will not report that in all the scientific polls, he's number one, number two, or number three.
[00:51:21.598 --> 00:51:24.100]  And Paul just says, I'm number three.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.004]  And you're being told by talk show hosts, local and national, he cannot win.
[00:51:29.144 --> 00:51:37.849]  And they get frustrated with all the Ron Paul supporters calling in like you're a kook or you're some minority.
[00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:43.112]  All we've got to do is expose Rick Perry and Mitt Romney's real record and it's over for them.
[00:51:43.112 --> 00:51:49.775]  We've got three and a half good months ahead of the beginning of the caucuses and primaries in Iowa, Florida, New Hampshire.
[00:51:49.775 --> 00:51:51.616]  We can put Ron Paul in there.
[00:51:51.616 --> 00:51:56.639]  He is exponentially growing and he's broken through the first few hoaxes that he can't win.
[00:51:57.745 --> 00:52:05.688]  In fact, I told you that Rick Perry's poll numbers would start dropping before he'd even announced he was number one.
[00:52:05.688 --> 00:52:08.909]  Now he's following number two, number three, or number four in every poll.
[00:52:08.909 --> 00:52:16.733]  Here's Time Magazine out this week, the rise of Rick Perry, and trying to prop him up, trying to say he's the man.
[00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.773]  And what does it say in here on the first page?
[00:52:18.773 --> 00:52:20.634]  Give me a document cam shot for viewers.
[00:52:20.634 --> 00:52:27.097]  It says, if he can deal with the Tea Party, if he can win them over because they don't think he's real,
[00:52:28.055 --> 00:52:31.278]  He can win.
[00:52:31.278 --> 00:52:31.639]  You see?
[00:52:31.639 --> 00:52:36.884]  He's got to become Ron Paul to win.
[00:52:36.884 --> 00:52:40.747]  Aggie yell leader, that means cheerleader, Texas governor, one-time Democrat.
[00:52:40.747 --> 00:52:44.831]  Since launching his campaign for president, Rick Perry has turned the Republican Party upside down.
[00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:49.075]  Can he win over the Tea Party without making independent voters cringe?
[00:52:49.075 --> 00:52:50.417]  As if the Tea Party's unpopular.
[00:52:51.564 --> 00:52:56.526]  The ideas of liberty and freedom and Second Amendment and private property rights, those are extremely popular ideas.
[00:52:56.526 --> 00:53:00.087]  But the controlled media says, oh, you're white if you're in the Tea Party.
[00:53:00.087 --> 00:53:04.788]  Automatically trying to say if you're black or Hispanic or Asian, you can't be for freedom.
[00:53:04.788 --> 00:53:07.109]  It's always about dividing everybody.
[00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:08.229]  So here's Rick Perry.
[00:53:08.229 --> 00:53:11.490]  Now, what's happened to Rick Perry?
[00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:12.551]  I'll show you this article.
[00:53:12.551 --> 00:53:15.212]  Herman Cain wins Florida straw poll in stunning victory.
[00:53:15.212 --> 00:53:16.412]  Rick Perry in deep trouble.
[00:53:18.254 --> 00:53:26.039]  You know, as slick-talking as Allen West is, you notice he went ahead and voted for the spending increase, even though he promised he wouldn't.
[00:53:26.039 --> 00:53:27.941]  Same thing with Herman Cain.
[00:53:27.941 --> 00:53:37.568]  Pro-Patriot Act, formerly worked for the Federal Reserve, pro-torture, pro-national sales tax, and by the way, now he's announced they're going to keep the income tax as well.
[00:53:38.336 --> 00:53:44.261]  It was always the plan to bring in a sales tax or a consumption tax, a VAT tax.
[00:53:44.261 --> 00:53:45.421]  That's what the big central banks want.
[00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:46.762]  They're not going to get rid of the income tax.
[00:53:46.762 --> 00:53:47.983]  They're going to change the name of it.
[00:53:47.983 --> 00:53:50.145]  You're not going to get rid of the income tax and get a sales tax.
[00:53:50.145 --> 00:53:51.426]  You're going to get both.
[00:53:51.426 --> 00:53:53.468]  And I told you that 15 years ago.
[00:53:53.468 --> 00:53:55.209]  It's always been the central bank's plan.
[00:53:55.209 --> 00:53:58.511]  It's what they're demanding right now in Europe.
[00:53:58.511 --> 00:54:00.433]  But again, why did folks vote for Herman Cain?
[00:54:00.433 --> 00:54:04.316]  He spent the last two years there before he even announced his campaign, basically campaigning there.
[00:54:05.287 --> 00:54:09.570]  So he won, Rick Perry didn't win, and what do they say?
[00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.171]  Herman Cain wins Florida straw poll in stunning victory.
[00:54:12.171 --> 00:54:16.174]  Rick Perry in deep trouble.
[00:54:16.174 --> 00:54:17.815]  And I agree with the Miami Herald.
[00:54:17.815 --> 00:54:24.899]  His poll numbers are plunging.
[00:54:24.899 --> 00:54:27.160]  His poll numbers are plunging.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.602]  What, Rick Perry got 14% Ron Paul right behind him.
[00:54:30.602 --> 00:54:31.523]  And that's in Florida.
[00:54:34.167 --> 00:54:44.614]  So again, who can beat Barack Obama in all the major polls in a head-to-head race?
[00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.095]  Ron Paul.
[00:54:46.095 --> 00:54:59.284]  Who is undisputedly in third place with the establishment, Democrat, Republican, across the board, telling you he can't win and scared to death of him, and when he does win polls, dragging it off the NBC or Fox websites?
[00:55:00.782 --> 00:55:01.663]  Ron Paul.
[00:55:01.663 --> 00:55:03.485]  That's who they're scared of.
[00:55:03.485 --> 00:55:08.571]  Oh, by the way, I thought I would mention this.
[00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:11.694]  Rick Perry literally gets up there as 10 years as governor.
[00:55:11.694 --> 00:55:19.482]  He doubled the size of the state budget, doubled taxes, brought in three new taxes, the franchise tax and others that are really an income tax on businesses.
[00:55:20.498 --> 00:55:28.262]  Rick Perry, who tried to hand 8,000 miles of roads over to foreign companies and grab hundreds of thousands, if not millions of acres in eminent domain.
[00:55:28.262 --> 00:55:31.204]  A guy that's for forced inoculations, on and on and on.
[00:55:31.204 --> 00:55:41.489]  While he was governor and made cities sanctuary cities and in-state tuition and all the rest of it, he said, well, it'd be downright mean in the debate to not give illegals in-state tuition.
[00:55:41.489 --> 00:55:44.510]  Really, somebody from Oklahoma doesn't get that coming to Texas.
[00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:49.513]  You know, if you go to Mexico, you don't get in-state tuition.
[00:55:50.976 --> 00:55:53.800]  If you're an illegal or an immigrant, you get arrested.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.365]  Mexico has some of the most draconian immigration laws in the world, but that's okay.
[00:55:57.365 --> 00:55:59.628]  We're just supposed to have bleeding hearts here and have open borders.
[00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:03.116]  By the way, I want Mexico to have freedom.
[00:56:03.116 --> 00:56:08.061]  I don't want the UN down there forcing the people off their land up to Mexico City and then north.
[00:56:08.061 --> 00:56:10.723]  The point is it's all globalism and the globalists are for it.
[00:56:10.723 --> 00:56:22.755]  But 81% of the jobs were immigrants and 95% of those, this is Wall Street Journal, Daily Mail, you name it, 93% of those weren't even legal.
[00:56:24.928 --> 00:56:29.589]  80 plus percent were immigrants and 90 plus percent were illegals.
[00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:38.732]  That's the new jobs in Texas because Rick Perry made it the biggest sanctuary state in the country after California.
[00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:43.494]  Vicente Fox came here six years ago and gave him awards that I bullhorned.
[00:56:43.494 --> 00:56:45.354]  I shut down their speech at the governor's mansion.
[00:56:45.354 --> 00:56:46.294]  It's on video.
[00:56:46.294 --> 00:56:46.795]  It's online.
[00:56:46.795 --> 00:56:48.355]  Just type in Battle for the Republic.
[00:56:48.355 --> 00:56:49.796]  That's the name of the documentary.
[00:56:49.796 --> 00:56:50.496]  It's in there.
[00:56:50.496 --> 00:56:50.836]  Online.
[00:56:50.836 --> 00:56:51.176]  YouTube.
[00:56:52.794 --> 00:56:57.681]  I bullhorned him, and I always get emails going, show me where Rick Perry got awards from Vicente Fox.
[00:56:57.681 --> 00:57:01.867]  And I send people out the email, or I send them the video.
[00:57:01.867 --> 00:57:03.949]  Yes, yes, yes, here it is.
[00:57:03.949 --> 00:57:07.094]  Immigrants take most jobs in Texas as Americans fill only 20%.
[00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:09.874]  I don't know.
[00:57:25.655 --> 00:57:28.356]  93% of the 81% of jobs are illegal aliens.
[00:57:28.356 --> 00:57:30.257]  That's who Rick Perry is!
[00:57:30.257 --> 00:57:32.018]  Carbon taxes!
[00:57:32.018 --> 00:57:33.499]  Hillary care!
[00:57:33.499 --> 00:57:35.360]  Same thing with Mitt Romney!
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.803]  And you idiot Republicans love getting up there on the radio and supporting it.
[00:57:40.803 --> 00:57:42.584]  And you're gonna get what you deserve!
[00:57:42.584 --> 00:57:45.606]  A bankrupt, imploded, police state America!
[00:57:45.606 --> 00:57:48.148]  You're just as idiots as the Obama supporters!
[00:57:48.148 --> 00:57:48.668]  You're idiots!
[00:57:50.455 --> 00:57:52.036]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:55.479]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[00:57:55.479 --> 00:57:58.061]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[00:57:58.061 --> 00:58:01.123]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[00:58:01.123 --> 00:58:01.923]  Very different.
[00:58:01.923 --> 00:58:05.426]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[00:58:05.726 --> 00:58:11.871]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[00:58:11.871 --> 00:58:14.113]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[00:58:14.113 --> 00:58:18.216]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[00:58:18.216 --> 00:58:21.879]  The huge issue of the Greatest Depression is on everyone's mind.
[00:58:21.879 --> 00:58:28.245]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[00:58:28.245 --> 00:58:29.946]  So everyone needs food security.
[00:58:30.086 --> 00:58:33.990]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect.
[00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:37.214]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.
[00:58:37.214 --> 00:58:43.541]  Get stocked up with the best storable foods out there with eFoodsDirect and be prepared for any emergency before it happens.
[00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:46.544]  To take advantage of this special, call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:58:51.593 --> 00:58:55.614]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.614 --> 00:58:58.855]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.855 --> 00:59:03.636]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.636 --> 00:59:10.038]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.038 --> 00:59:12.279]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.819 --> 00:59:13.979]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:59:13.979 --> 00:59:14.740]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.080]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.724 --> 00:59:33.846]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.846 --> 00:59:39.010]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:51.501]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:55.085]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.085 --> 00:59:58.287]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:08.622]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.622 --> 01:00:11.624]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:22.826]  Okay, look, it's so elementary and so simple that Ron Paul is being cheated that I've gotten so angry today that I have hardly been able to talk.
[01:00:22.826 --> 01:00:26.788]  I rarely stumble about and I've done that some today because it's so ridiculous.
[01:00:26.788 --> 01:00:30.010]  I watched the entire establishment running scared from Ron Paul.
[01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:36.973]  I know we got a bunch of callers, the Robert, Barry, TJ, Jim, Carol, Troy, Benjamin, Jerry, Will, Chase, Kathy, Brian.
[01:00:36.973 --> 01:00:38.734]  I will get to every single one of you.
[01:00:39.734 --> 01:00:46.758]  Luke Rodowski's just popping in for five, six minutes with an update on the arrest at Wall Street, the demonstrations there.
[01:00:46.758 --> 01:00:51.780]  Popping in for about five minutes the next segment, just back from Colorado with a martial law drill is Aaron Dice.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.961]  He's going to pop in and then back to your calls.
[01:00:53.961 --> 01:00:58.984]  Now I say if you disagree, go to the head of the line, if you volunteer that information.
[01:00:58.984 --> 01:01:02.406]  The problem is most people that disagree now don't really disagree.
[01:01:02.406 --> 01:01:04.287]  They just use it as an excuse to go to the head of the line.
[01:01:05.054 --> 01:01:07.995]  Or they want to lecture me on how I should do the show or something.
[01:01:07.995 --> 01:01:10.837]  I mean disagree with something I've said.
[01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:15.399]  But let's see if Carl does, because that actually gets me to wake up when somebody disagrees.
[01:01:15.399 --> 01:01:17.600]  Carl in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.722]  I want to say thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:21.722 --> 01:01:29.325]  And yes, I have three points of disagreement, but I must admit they are more about the delivery of your content than the content itself.
[01:01:29.325 --> 01:01:30.126]  They always are.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.361]  I don't want to talk about me all day, though!
[01:01:33.361 --> 01:01:34.722]  I mean, that's the issue!
[01:01:34.722 --> 01:01:37.224]  Well, one of the ideas can help Ron Paul get elected.
[01:01:37.224 --> 01:01:38.865]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:01:38.865 --> 01:01:48.130]  Okay, the first one is Alex Jones, you mentioned before that you turned down publishing deals because you don't have the time and you can reach more people over the internet.
[01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:55.235]  I believe that's true, but we need to get the reading public on our side and here's an easy way to get your message to them.
[01:01:55.235 --> 01:01:57.016]  Transcribe broadcasts.
[01:01:57.568 --> 01:02:02.493]  I think that could really get your word out with a minimum time investment and increase the revenue to your operation.
[01:02:13.086 --> 01:02:24.751]  Yeah, I think the thing is, I want to write like some awesome 1984 non-fiction tome, and really crystallize it, and really get behind it, and not just churn out pulp.
[01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:29.793]  But you're right, I should do it, I should do more, and I should call back all these publishers that are calling me.
[01:02:29.793 --> 01:02:37.536]  But hell, if that little turkey Glenn Beck, Mr. Pro bailout, Mr. Pro Rick Perry can have his own imprint, I sure should.
[01:02:37.536 --> 01:02:40.577]  I'd dwarf him on the web, and the web is the future.
[01:02:40.577 --> 01:02:42.578]  Tell me what else I've done wrong here, or other...
[01:02:42.918 --> 01:02:45.359]  That's not really disagreeing, Carl.
[01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:49.241]  Alright, well, I apologize if I'm wasting your time, but I feel these ideas... You're not wasting my time!
[01:02:49.241 --> 01:02:49.902]  They're great ideas.
[01:02:49.902 --> 01:02:50.702]  What's next?
[01:02:50.702 --> 01:02:55.465]  Alright, well, I believe the true measure of a leader is the influence they have on others.
[01:02:55.465 --> 01:03:01.868]  And while I know you have great influence over some, in the end, I believe that you scare more people into merely observing the truth.
[01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:07.331]  I disagree.
[01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:09.855]  I've been the most effective person out there other than Ron Paul.
[01:03:09.855 --> 01:03:11.217]  Nobody can deny that.
[01:03:11.217 --> 01:03:12.519]  And I'm not trying to scare folks.
[01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:14.201]  I believe people aren't cowards.
[01:03:14.201 --> 01:03:18.167]  I'm trying to shock them out of complacency in their trance.
[01:03:19.144 --> 01:03:37.194]  Oh, and I agree that you have been very influential in the alternative news media, but I feel that you do come across very tough to some people, and I'm not saying you change who you are, because you are who you are, and that's impossible to change, and you have made great strides because you stand firm on your principles.
[01:03:37.194 --> 01:03:40.736]  But what I really disagree with is something called the losada.
[01:03:41.332 --> 01:03:49.939]  So, it pretty much is a term derived from a psychologist who said that for every one negative interaction, you need three positive interactions.
[01:03:49.939 --> 01:03:51.420]  Hey, hold on one second!
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.200]  Yes?
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.922]  There's music playing in here.
[01:03:54.922 --> 01:03:56.624]  And earlier, music just turned off.
[01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:59.025]  Okay, just, sir, go ahead.
[01:03:59.025 --> 01:04:06.231]  Okay, well, a psychologist named Losada did research showing that for every one negative remark, you need three positive remarks.
[01:04:06.693 --> 01:04:09.854]  To really allow a human to flourish in a team environment.
[01:04:09.854 --> 01:04:17.278]  And you want your listeners to be part of the team for freedom that promotes ideas of liberty and justice.
[01:04:17.278 --> 01:04:22.340]  And I feel that for every one positive remark, you have three negative remarks.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:25.962]  Listen, I gotta go, but I heard your points and it's good constructive criticism.
[01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:31.552]  Look, I don't have the time and the energy to sit here and craft everything I say and do.
[01:04:31.552 --> 01:04:36.854]  Some days it's genius, other days, you know, it's moderately effective.
[01:04:36.854 --> 01:04:39.935]  Anything in the face of this dehumanization is good.
[01:04:39.935 --> 01:04:41.675]  Resistance is victory.
[01:04:44.503 --> 01:04:49.208]  I see it as positive to say negative things about the globalist.
[01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:52.411]  So you're looking at things from a two-dimensional perspective.
[01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:57.516]  Telling somebody, hey, there's a big ditch over there, don't run your car off in it, that's positive, it's not negative.
[01:05:00.427 --> 01:05:02.128]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.128 --> 01:05:07.430]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:08.970]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:17.754]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:18.494 --> 01:05:26.019]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:26.019 --> 01:05:34.024]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:34.024 --> 01:05:39.247]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:41.409]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[01:05:42.929 --> 01:05:47.411]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:51.913]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:03.939 --> 01:06:04.139]  Yeah!
[01:06:04.139 --> 01:06:04.500]  Let me at him!
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.280]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:06:18.905 --> 01:06:25.091]  I got Aaron in here to give us a report on the big Marshall Law financial collapse drill they just had out in Denver.
[01:06:25.091 --> 01:06:26.292]  I had our reporters there.
[01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:31.196]  I got Luke Rudowsky popping in about arrests on Wall Street, but I want to get to your calls.
[01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:35.320]  Robert, Barry, everybody else that's holding, we're going to get to you, well, here in about a minute or two.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.223]  I want to play a clip that I've been mentioning of Ron Paul.
[01:06:39.223 --> 01:06:42.806]  This is in the last debate, being asked who he would take as his running mate.
[01:06:43.687 --> 01:06:50.453]  And he was saying, well, once he is a first or second place candidate, that he would do that, that he is in third place.
[01:06:50.453 --> 01:06:53.576]  And that's a very moderate, conservative statement by Ron Paul.
[01:06:54.608 --> 01:06:57.069]  He is third place, probably second.
[01:06:57.069 --> 01:07:06.592]  And Rick Perry, as the Miami Herald points out, is plunging as people learn he worked for Al Gore, campaigned for Hillary Care, forced inoculations.
[01:07:06.592 --> 01:07:09.573]  But Romney is exactly the same!
[01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:13.734]  These are globalist, socialist, corporate cronyites.
[01:07:13.734 --> 01:07:18.375]  Because the corporations want to pool your money so they can then suck it offshore.
[01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:20.456]  And if you idiot Republicans vote for
[01:07:22.594 --> 01:07:24.995]  Mitt Romney or Rick Perry, you get what you deserve.
[01:07:24.995 --> 01:07:27.536]  Just like you idiot Democrats.
[01:07:27.536 --> 01:07:30.377]  Of course the economy didn't get better with Obama.
[01:07:30.377 --> 01:07:32.258]  Of course the wars continued.
[01:07:32.258 --> 01:07:34.218]  Of course the torture continued.
[01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:36.359]  Of course the spying continued.
[01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:39.020]  Of course all the insider garbage.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.141]  Look at who financed him.
[01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.782]  Look at how the system supported Obama.
[01:07:44.082 --> 01:07:49.889]  When the system, like Time Magazine, is supporting somebody like Rick Perry, look out!
[01:07:49.889 --> 01:07:57.357]  When they're lying, and deceiving, and pulling polls, and saying somebody can't win, that's who you go to!
[01:07:57.357 --> 01:08:00.261]  It's so simple, it makes me get very angry.
[01:08:00.261 --> 01:08:02.603]  And you don't want to see me when I'm angry.
[01:08:02.603 --> 01:08:04.566]  Let's go ahead and go to this Ron Paul clip, here it is.
[01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:10.556]  I plan to make a choice at the moment because I am on national polls.
[01:08:10.556 --> 01:08:12.997]  It seems like I'm in third place now.
[01:08:12.997 --> 01:08:14.738]  I think it would be inappropriate.
[01:08:14.738 --> 01:08:20.120]  As soon as I'm one of the two top tier, then I will start thinking along that line.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:30.303]  But right now I'm going to defer and just work very hard and make sure that I stay in the top tier and then eventually be one of the top two contenders.
[01:08:33.635 --> 01:08:35.562]  Texas Congressman Ron Paul, he joins me now.
[01:08:35.562 --> 01:08:36.264]  How are you Congressman?
[01:08:36.264 --> 01:08:36.946]  That's enough.
[01:08:38.663 --> 01:08:47.805]  You know, I've had a chance to talk to Ron Paul quite a bit off the record before, and when he was first going to run, I said, look, sir, you probably won't win this first time, but you can probably win the second time.
[01:08:47.805 --> 01:08:53.126]  And you know you're going to influence the debate and warn people about currency devaluation and everything else.
[01:08:53.126 --> 01:08:56.407]  We need you to get in there to keep putting heat on the Federal Reserve.
[01:08:56.407 --> 01:08:57.527]  And he said, no, you're probably right.
[01:08:57.527 --> 01:08:58.767]  I'm probably going to run.
[01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:02.428]  And then, of course, I didn't say anything for a few months knowing he was going to run.
[01:09:02.428 --> 01:09:05.549]  And it's the same thing before this last race.
[01:09:06.409 --> 01:09:10.951]  I don't ever try to call Ron Paul up and give him advice, but I think I am.
[01:09:10.951 --> 01:09:12.292]  And it's this.
[01:09:12.292 --> 01:09:16.274]  He needs to get up at the next debate and say, hold on a minute!
[01:09:16.274 --> 01:09:23.057]  And hold up a sheet and say, the average candidate was given 10 minutes in the last debate, I was given 4 minutes.
[01:09:23.057 --> 01:09:25.118]  I've been given the least amount of time in every debate.
[01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:28.800]  And if the moderators aren't saying that in the question, say, listen!
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.201]  I know you got an agenda, give me the floor!
[01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.702]  And I know Ron Paul can get angry, because I've seen it before.
[01:09:34.867 --> 01:09:37.048]  Okay, it's always the nice guy that's being real friendly.
[01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.630]  That's because they're actually a Tyrannosaurus.
[01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:44.113]  Only guy on the Congressional Baseball team to ever knock out a home run.
[01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:51.258]  You saw when that bearer Sasha Cohen went after him, Ron Paul, you know, basically slapped him upside the head, pushed him out of the way.
[01:09:51.258 --> 01:09:54.240]  Ron Paul is a nice guy because he's aggressive.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.542]  Aggressive people have trained themselves to be friendly.
[01:09:57.542 --> 01:10:00.284]  But he needs to turn loose and open up a can of you-know-what.
[01:10:00.284 --> 01:10:01.945]  He needs to say, listen!
[01:10:02.785 --> 01:10:05.347]  I've been giving less time to everybody else up here.
[01:10:05.347 --> 01:10:06.668]  I've won most of the straw polls.
[01:10:06.668 --> 01:10:10.931]  I've come in first, second, and third in all the scientific polls, but everybody says I can't win.
[01:10:10.931 --> 01:10:14.153]  That's because I'm the only one up here not bought and paid for.
[01:10:14.153 --> 01:10:15.494]  I'm not a globalist whore.
[01:10:15.494 --> 01:10:16.835]  You want America back.
[01:10:16.835 --> 01:10:18.276]  You want the Republic back.
[01:10:18.276 --> 01:10:21.579]  Vote for me and stop letting the controlled media tell you who's gonna win.
[01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:24.481]  And I'm gonna go further here.
[01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:27.083]  And then just basically lay out the facts.
[01:10:28.775 --> 01:10:33.176]  And he needs to get aggressive and say, I have been in the top tier since the beginning.
[01:10:33.176 --> 01:10:34.577]  The top three is the top tier.
[01:10:34.577 --> 01:10:36.457]  I actually have to disagree with Ron Paul.
[01:10:36.457 --> 01:10:38.858]  This thing about, I'd be in the first or second tier.
[01:10:38.858 --> 01:10:40.498]  You're definitely in the top tier.
[01:10:40.498 --> 01:10:42.499]  The top tier is the top three candidates.
[01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:43.959]  First, second, and third place.
[01:10:43.959 --> 01:10:46.140]  That's how any game, any race works.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.780]  The top three are the main contenders.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:53.382]  The top three teams in the NBA, the NFL, the National Baseball League.
[01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:56.763]  That's how it works!
[01:10:56.763 --> 01:10:57.763]  In horse racing!
[01:10:59.275 --> 01:11:05.999]  And for them to say that a top contender is not a contender is a rigged game out in the open!
[01:11:05.999 --> 01:11:10.562]  And he should instantly surge to number one just by evidence of that.
[01:11:10.562 --> 01:11:18.347]  If you people want the same thing over and over again, vote for Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, or Barack Obama.
[01:11:18.347 --> 01:11:22.370]  A bunch of slick guys in fancy suits reading off teleprompters.
[01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:24.251]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:11:24.251 --> 01:11:25.132]  I'm just getting angry now.
[01:11:28.354 --> 01:11:28.954]  Rick Perry.
[01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:32.535]  81% of the new jobs are illegal aliens.
[01:11:32.535 --> 01:11:34.096]  Yeah, I guess you did bring some jobs here.
[01:11:34.096 --> 01:11:41.899]  You drove down the wages while you were here and passed a bunch of new taxes you can give to the illegal aliens and free welfare, you piece of trash.
[01:11:41.899 --> 01:11:43.099]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:49.781]  Some dirty Hillary supporter, some dirty Obama supporter, dirty Bill Clinton supporter, Al Gore supporter.
[01:11:49.781 --> 01:11:51.602]  I can't handle it.
[01:11:51.602 --> 01:11:54.543]  Mitt Romney supports carbon taxes?
[01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:59.391]  I'm so sick of the fact that I spend all my time being informed and other people aren't informed.
[01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:01.112]  I had Lord Moncton on a week ago.
[01:12:01.112 --> 01:12:02.152]  Great guy.
[01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:10.676]  But he was like, well, once the Congress, once the Democrats heard I was here to debate Al Gore, they said I couldn't speak or Gore wouldn't speak and they put Newt Gingrich in instead.
[01:12:10.676 --> 01:12:11.796]  He did a pretty good job.
[01:12:11.796 --> 01:12:18.098]  Newt Gingrich does TV ads supporting carbon taxes and global warming with, who's he do it with?
[01:12:18.098 --> 01:12:18.579]  I forget.
[01:12:18.579 --> 01:12:22.040]  Pull up the, go to YouTube.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.461]  Newt Gingrich does global warming ad.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.682]  I think it's Hillary Clinton he's sitting there with.
[01:12:29.682 --> 01:12:36.468]  The point is, he wrote the foreword to Alvin and Heidi Topler's book calling for the end of America and global government.
[01:12:36.468 --> 01:12:37.488]  I'm sick of it!
[01:12:37.488 --> 01:12:39.290]  He's a Bilderberg Group member!
[01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:47.196]  You don't get invited to the Bilderberg Group unless you've shown you'll spread your legs to any New World Order operative politically.
[01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.318]  This is with Pelosi.
[01:12:49.318 --> 01:12:50.499]  Show the stinking video.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.649]  Then I'll go to the calls and Aaron, or maybe I won't.
[01:12:53.649 --> 01:12:56.118]  I'm just getting more and more wound up here.
[01:12:56.118 --> 01:12:57.222]  If I have to sl-
[01:12:58.365 --> 01:13:03.528]  It's one thing if you're going to support carbon taxes like that swollen con artist Al Gore.
[01:13:03.528 --> 01:13:04.468]  That's one thing.
[01:13:04.468 --> 01:13:19.557]  But to have this entire Republican leadership being crammed down our throats supporting carbon taxes, NAFTA highways, forced inoculations, socialist health care, and I got to sit here and watch national radio host endorsing Mitt Romney?
[01:13:19.557 --> 01:13:21.638]  You people make me want to vomit!
[01:13:21.638 --> 01:13:24.539]  Your listeners are idiots!
[01:13:24.539 --> 01:13:25.740]  What is wrong with you?
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.101]  You said you found the clip?
[01:13:28.257 --> 01:13:33.302]  Here, here, here, here, here is Newt Gingrich with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:13:33.302 --> 01:13:38.067]  I said Hillary, another hag, but here it is.
[01:13:38.067 --> 01:13:39.028]  I will play it in a second.
[01:13:41.804 --> 01:13:43.286]  Ah, stupid YouTube's not working.
[01:13:58.843 --> 01:14:01.904]  We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.
[01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:06.385]  If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.
[01:14:06.385 --> 01:14:08.646]  Go to wecansolveit.org.
[01:14:08.646 --> 01:14:10.227]  Together, we can do this.
[01:14:21.297 --> 01:14:26.019]  Hi, we're political whores bought and paid for by mega banks that create money out of nothing.
[01:14:26.019 --> 01:14:34.862]  They own the oil companies, and together with the oil companies, they're lobbying to shut down all coal production because that's 50 plus percent of the power in North America.
[01:14:34.862 --> 01:14:42.165]  By doing that, it'll jack up overall use of oil and other power systems and increase our profits via artificial scarcity.
[01:14:42.165 --> 01:14:44.225]  Please let us cheat you and rob you.
[01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:45.106]  Here, let's go ahead.
[01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:48.067]  That's the guy they sent to fight Al Gore on global warming.
[01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:50.454]  Hey Alex, great honor to talk to you again.
[01:14:50.454 --> 01:14:56.096]  Hey, I got a point that'll help Ron Paul next time he gets cornered about Iran and why we need to start another war with him.
[01:15:09.645 --> 01:15:35.604]  He needs to bring that point up that when we are changed in front of Mike Huckabee and said if we allow Iran to have a nuke that it was reckless and all this kind of garbage, that Ron Paul needs to come back and say, well, it would be more reckless if we let, start a war with Iran, they mine the Straits of Hormuz, they knock out the refineries in Saudi Arabia and the delivery systems to the tankers, what kind of depression that'll start.
[01:15:35.604 --> 01:15:36.364]  Yeah, yeah, stay right there.
[01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:37.245]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:15:37.245 --> 01:15:37.565]  Look, look.
[01:15:39.179 --> 01:15:40.400]  Iran is not Iraq.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.102]  There's three times as many people.
[01:15:43.102 --> 01:15:44.283]  They already fought the U.S.
[01:15:44.283 --> 01:15:48.285]  through the Iraq proxy in the Iran-Iraq war, and over a million and a half of them died.
[01:15:48.285 --> 01:15:50.807]  They are going to go absolutely wild.
[01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:52.608]  And they've got inspectors in there.
[01:15:52.608 --> 01:15:54.189]  They've been running reactors for months.
[01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:55.811]  They can't make weapons fuel with it.
[01:15:56.846 --> 01:15:58.748]  It's just absolute baloney!
[01:15:58.748 --> 01:16:00.529]  They lied about WMDs in Iraq!
[01:16:00.529 --> 01:16:05.072]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:16:05.072 --> 01:16:09.416]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:16:09.416 --> 01:16:14.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.880]  It's true.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:21.582]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:16:21.582 --> 01:16:25.184]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:16:25.184 --> 01:16:29.886]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:32.647]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:16:32.647 --> 01:16:35.988]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:16:36.328 --> 01:16:41.250]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:46.311]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:50.493]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:16:50.493 --> 01:16:52.273]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:07.478]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:17:07.478 --> 01:17:12.620]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:21.343]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:17:21.343 --> 01:17:25.405]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:17:25.405 --> 01:17:27.745]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:17:39.497 --> 01:17:41.638]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:43.420]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.322]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:17:46.322 --> 01:17:50.545]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:17:50.545 --> 01:17:52.946]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:17:55.648 --> 01:17:57.229]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:58.010]  Got it.
[01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.891]  Others don't.
[01:18:04.286 --> 01:18:05.547]  Tyranny is here.
[01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:09.490]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:11.892]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:18:11.892 --> 01:18:17.597]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:18:17.597 --> 01:18:23.842]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:30.226]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:18:30.226 --> 01:18:34.409]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:38.692]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:18:38.692 --> 01:18:44.657]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:18:44.657 --> 01:18:48.199]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:18:48.199 --> 01:18:50.180]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:50.621]  It's here.

[01:18:59.989 --> 01:19:01.590]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:05.033]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[01:19:05.033 --> 01:19:07.615]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:19:07.615 --> 01:19:10.678]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:19:10.678 --> 01:19:11.479]  Very different.
[01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:14.982]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[01:19:15.282 --> 01:19:21.424]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:23.645]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:19:23.645 --> 01:19:27.767]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:19:27.767 --> 01:19:31.428]  The huge issue of the Greatest Depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:19:31.428 --> 01:19:37.771]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[01:19:37.771 --> 01:19:39.632]  So everyone needs food security.
[01:19:39.632 --> 01:19:43.353]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from Eat Foods Direct.

[01:20:01.561 --> 01:20:03.081]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:03.081 --> 01:20:05.122]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.122 --> 01:20:08.343]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:16.428 --> 01:20:29.153]  You know, what's going on is there's a lot of people that think they're members of the establishment out there and they wear suits and they sit there in little stuff coats and try to talk real calm like an NPR propagandist.
[01:20:29.153 --> 01:20:30.294]  I'm getting angry.
[01:20:30.294 --> 01:20:31.494]  I'm getting motivated.
[01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:35.836]  I'm telling you how I really feel and what I intellectually really see.
[01:20:36.696 --> 01:20:51.166]  We got a bunch of foreign banks that have seized our government, that are butchering our constitution, that are setting up a police state to secure their ill-gotten gains, to raise all these new taxes and austerity, to pay them the money they've stolen, in derivatives.
[01:20:51.166 --> 01:20:52.847]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:56.709]  And meanwhile, the government's always, oh, we're doing this to protect you from Al-Qaeda.
[01:20:56.709 --> 01:21:00.612]  I saw, they've got drone attacks all over North Africa to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:21:01.567 --> 01:21:02.590]  Based out of Libya!
[01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:05.058]  They just put Al-Qaeda in control of Libya!
[01:21:05.058 --> 01:21:06.662]  They talk to you like you're an idiot!
[01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:16.673]  They give you people with voting records about as liberal as Bill Clinton, Mitt Romney, and Rick Perry and tell you they're great.
[01:21:16.673 --> 01:21:20.094]  And yes, then they sit there and say we've got to have war with Iran.
[01:21:20.094 --> 01:21:27.056]  When Ahmadinejad's about to be out of office, when the UN is in there, the reactors cannot produce weapons material.
[01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:28.296]  But so what?
[01:21:28.296 --> 01:21:30.237]  Dozens of countries have weapons.
[01:21:30.237 --> 01:21:31.377]  South Africa has nukes.
[01:21:31.377 --> 01:21:33.197]  We're going to attack them?
[01:21:33.197 --> 01:21:34.818]  The Russians had 10,000 nukes.
[01:21:34.818 --> 01:21:35.798]  We never had a war with them.
[01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:39.681]  Iran gets one nuke, they use them, they're a parking lot!
[01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:43.003]  What about somebody staging a nuke attack, though, to start World War III?
[01:21:43.003 --> 01:21:48.128]  To politically then get everybody to stand down and go along with the police state takeover.
[01:21:48.128 --> 01:21:50.089]  Did you ever think about that?
[01:21:50.089 --> 01:21:56.794]  Or is it too much fun to hate Ahmadinejad because he doesn't look like you?
[01:21:56.794 --> 01:21:58.075]  Dinejad, Dinejad.
[01:21:58.075 --> 01:22:00.758]  I'm having this Freudian weird foible.
[01:22:00.758 --> 01:22:02.219]  Is it Dinejad or Dinejad, Aaron?
[01:22:03.424 --> 01:22:06.707]  Dinejad, Achmed Dinejad, always said it right, let me again, Jeed.
[01:22:06.707 --> 01:22:08.388]  I'm gonna keep saying Jeed.
[01:22:08.388 --> 01:22:12.471]  Robert in Georgia, finish your point, we're gonna get a report from Aaron Dykes, then go on to more calls.
[01:22:12.471 --> 01:22:28.685]  Yeah, it's common sense when you think it through about, you know, Mike Cuckabee's comment about irresponsibility, allowing them to have a nuke, but if the tankers can't come to our country, they're sitting empty because the Saudi Arabia oil fields have been bombed out and the Strait Hormuz is mined.
[01:22:29.617 --> 01:22:34.668]  That, the fuel, the trucks won't be able to run to the grocery stores to restock that.
[01:22:34.668 --> 01:22:37.493]  People won't be able to fuel the cars to get to work.
[01:22:37.493 --> 01:22:40.159]  And so we're already teetering on, well we're already in a depression.
[01:22:40.646 --> 01:22:43.168]  But that'll cause absolute anarchy in this country.
[01:22:43.168 --> 01:22:50.575]  But the globalists would love that because then they can blame all the problems on Iran while the foreign banks gut the country.
[01:22:50.575 --> 01:22:53.558]  See, we think of our government as like this patriotic group.
[01:22:53.558 --> 01:23:04.629]  It's openly owned by offshore banks who are exempt from taxes and then have their heads like Buffett come out and call for raising taxes to get rich when he helped write the loopholes for himself.
[01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:07.031]  Yeah, but here's the deal.
[01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:17.617]  When Ron Paul gets cornered again, whether it's in a debate or some reporter, he needs to bring that point up that that would be far more reckless if we started a war with Iran.
[01:23:18.638 --> 01:23:24.280]  I don't know if somehow you could get that over to Ron Paul the next time they, you know, pull a dirty trick on you.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:30.162]  Well, Ron Paul's going to do what Ron Paul's going to do, and he certainly played the nice guy, but now's the time to get aggressive.
[01:23:30.162 --> 01:23:31.182]  Robert, thank you.
[01:23:31.182 --> 01:23:34.163]  I'm going to talk to Aaron Dyches here for a few minutes.
[01:23:34.163 --> 01:23:35.384]  We're going to let his call go now.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.620]  Robert, thank you.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:44.303]  And then we're going to come back with Barry, TJ, Jim, Benjamin, Jerry, Will, Chase, Kathy, Brian, and others.
[01:23:44.303 --> 01:23:51.845]  Aaron Dykes, I appreciate you coming out on Sunday because I haven't talked to you since I sent you Thursday to cover the martial law drill there in Florida.
[01:23:51.845 --> 01:23:56.967]  Tell us exactly what you and Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News witnessed out there.
[01:23:57.267 --> 01:24:03.288]  Well, we got back yesterday, Alex, and the exercise took place mostly on Friday, starting around 5 a.m.
[01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.209]  And they said they took more than 18 months putting this together.
[01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:10.910]  I never saw the full budget, but it was Homeland Security grants, so our money.
[01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:16.111]  And they were just frothing all around the city, shutting down everything, using all these facilities.
[01:24:16.111 --> 01:24:23.652]  And they had four public facilities where the media was sort of invited, but then they still freaked out and interrogated us at almost every location.
[01:24:24.232 --> 01:24:25.494]  Then they had... Well, you're the enemy.
[01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:26.436]  You're the American people.
[01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:27.718]  They work for foreign banks.
[01:24:27.718 --> 01:24:30.622]  Then they had other secret locations, including the sports stadium.
[01:24:30.622 --> 01:24:33.827]  And when we showed up there, they really got weird.
[01:24:33.827 --> 01:24:35.029]  And tell us why they got weird.
[01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.351]  They didn't want you seeing the children.
[01:24:37.037 --> 01:24:46.482]  Yeah, because they were doing a relocation drill, taking the children to the sports stadium, and you know, that would be from all the Denver public schools, and then have the parents pick them up afterwards.
[01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:50.725]  They did a FEMA drill, using fake parents to pick up some real children.
[01:24:50.725 --> 01:24:53.226]  And again, why is FEMA involved with people's kids?
[01:24:53.226 --> 01:24:59.469]  A. Saw how great they did with the Superdome in New Orleans, and B. We've got the documents a decade ago.
[01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:05.693]  This is just training for the cops to take political dissidents to sports stadiums, and to make the parents come turn their guns in to get their kids.
[01:25:05.973 --> 01:25:11.897]  Well, yeah, if you use the pretext that it's keeping them safe from a school shooter, then it sounds nice and happy to bring them to the stadium.
[01:25:11.897 --> 01:25:13.898]  But yeah, it could be anything.
[01:25:13.898 --> 01:25:18.561]  Well, we happen to know from the clergy response teams and others, it is about political dissonance.
[01:25:18.561 --> 01:25:22.624]  And when the parents come, you check their ID and, oh, we need to take you in for questioning.
[01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:24.504]  Disappear.
[01:25:24.504 --> 01:25:24.764]  Right.
[01:25:24.764 --> 01:25:35.190]  But when we tried to check out the story and find out what they meant by testing student teacher processing activities at Mile High Stadium, which has been renamed a few times over the years, they wouldn't let us in.
[01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:36.431]  They wouldn't tell us anything.
[01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:43.396]  And finally, after like an hour of waiting, finally, they sent out the Denver Police Victims Unit guy to talk to us.
[01:25:44.116 --> 01:25:47.517]  They're kind of like, oh, you stayed too long at the elementary school drill earlier.
[01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:48.617]  There's nothing to see here.
[01:25:48.617 --> 01:25:55.059]  But yes, it is our goal to bring all children to the sports stadium in this drill or any real event.
[01:25:55.059 --> 01:26:01.301]  Aaron, what did you think of the school you went to that had the first graders with cops aiming guns at them?
[01:26:02.208 --> 01:26:03.868]  It was surreal to say the least.
[01:26:03.868 --> 01:26:09.970]  I mean, of course, if there really was a school shooter, it makes sense to bring in the cops, but what are they really using the SWAT teams for?
[01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:13.090]  To knock out people's homes, growing gardens, and the rest of it, right?
[01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:22.032]  Well, in the old days, if there was a school shooter, the first cop in just ran in, drove his car up, jumped in, ran in, and shot the guy, like with the UT tower shooter.
[01:26:22.032 --> 01:26:23.293]  They didn't play games.
[01:26:23.293 --> 01:26:24.653]  Now, in every case, they wait like
[01:26:24.773 --> 01:26:24.893]  Yeah.
[01:26:45.231 --> 01:26:47.472]  Yeah, it's really sad, and they had all the tables turned.
[01:26:47.472 --> 01:26:51.553]  So yeah, it was a scenario where the shooter had been there for a while before the SWAT team showed up.
[01:26:51.553 --> 01:26:53.734]  By the way, I don't want to just make that statement, Aaron.
[01:26:53.734 --> 01:26:58.196]  I had the Rocky Mountain News reporter on about 10 years ago, or 9 years ago, about this.
[01:26:58.196 --> 01:27:00.756]  And it's now defunct, Rocky Mountain News.
[01:27:00.756 --> 01:27:02.137]  Second biggest paper in Colorado.
[01:27:03.445 --> 01:27:09.631]  There were court cases and lawsuits that came out in court that the SWAT teams actually shot some of the kids at Columbine.
[01:27:09.631 --> 01:27:12.734]  And there were other shooters inside, and 127 bombs.
[01:27:12.734 --> 01:27:15.216]  That's CBS News, so I'm not just saying that.
[01:27:15.216 --> 01:27:15.837]  Sorry Aaron, go ahead.
[01:27:16.587 --> 01:27:17.868]  Yeah, it's upsetting.
[01:27:17.868 --> 01:27:22.953]  But as far as the drill we witnessed on Friday, who was playing the terrorist?
[01:27:22.953 --> 01:27:25.235]  It looked like a returning veteran to me, Alex.
[01:27:25.235 --> 01:27:30.260]  He was in the fatigues with the shooter gloves and it didn't look like... Well, we have all the training manuals.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.561]  It's always a returning veteran.
[01:27:31.561 --> 01:27:33.123]  Veterans are the number one threat.
[01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:34.104]  Homeland Security admits that.
[01:27:34.264 --> 01:27:46.932]  So everything Homeland Security's been warning about and propagandizing about for a year and a half or so, or probably longer, a year and a half that I'm directly aware of, they were playing out in one way or another in this drill that involved more than a hundred agencies.
[01:27:46.932 --> 01:27:57.560]  Well, when we got the documents three years ago from good cops sent to us, where they said gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans are the enemy of America, the Homeland Security came out and said, yeah, that is who we trained to fight.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.741]  And they put Al Qaeda in Libya.
[01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:00.261]  They're good.
[01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:01.381]  Al Qaeda's good.
[01:28:01.381 --> 01:28:03.062]  But George Washington is bad.
[01:28:03.062 --> 01:28:06.924]  And I actually have FEMA saying George Washington is bad in my film Road to Tyranny.
[01:28:06.924 --> 01:28:10.525]  I have them training cops that George Washington is bad.
[01:28:10.525 --> 01:28:12.406]  And Ron Paul, by the way.
[01:28:12.406 --> 01:28:13.186]  Yeah.
[01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:15.547]  And this is not satire, if you're a new listener.
[01:28:15.547 --> 01:28:17.608]  These are foreign banks that are destroying America.
[01:28:17.608 --> 01:28:18.829]  Of course they hate real Americans.
[01:28:19.704 --> 01:28:33.030]  But while they're prepping all the security with the mobile vans and everything and the NFL pat-downs, is it any wonder they're doing scenarios with malls, with shopping centers, with sports... Well, they admit now TSA's is gonna be in those, so they gotta get you ready for the next stage event there.
[01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:34.751]  It's all a big rollout, Aaron.
[01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:38.032]  Yeah, and so we just saw a piece of that here on Friday.
[01:28:38.032 --> 01:28:42.554]  I know on InfoWars Nightly News, weeknight, 7 o'clock, we're going to have a big report for us tomorrow.
[01:28:42.554 --> 01:28:49.256]  More footage at 7 o'clock tomorrow Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:28:49.256 --> 01:28:53.918]  I'm going to come back with more calls, then Luke Rodowski from the Wall Street demonstration arrest.
[01:28:53.918 --> 01:28:55.339]  Aaron Dykes, thanks for joining us.
[01:28:55.339 --> 01:28:56.359]  Thanks Alex.
[01:28:56.359 --> 01:28:56.879]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:00.698 --> 01:29:01.879]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:29:01.879 --> 01:29:08.802]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:11.363]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:29:11.363 --> 01:29:16.746]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:29:16.746 --> 01:29:19.787]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.848]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:29:22.088 --> 01:29:28.352]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:29:28.352 --> 01:29:31.714]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:29:31.714 --> 01:29:37.498]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:29:37.498 --> 01:29:39.139]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:29:39.139 --> 01:29:40.440]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.122]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:29:43.122 --> 01:29:47.344]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:29:47.344 --> 01:29:49.926]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:51.950]  End of America 3.com.
[01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:54.536]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:30:01.727 --> 01:30:06.409]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:30:06.409 --> 01:30:12.853]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:30:12.853 --> 01:30:15.114]  Number one, study the past.
[01:30:15.114 --> 01:30:17.515]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:30:17.515 --> 01:30:21.237]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:25.459]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:30:25.459 --> 01:30:29.303]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:30:29.303 --> 01:30:34.349]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:30:34.349 --> 01:30:37.774]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:30:38.334 --> 01:30:41.757]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:30:41.757 --> 01:30:46.261]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:51.185]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:30:51.185 --> 01:30:55.809]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:55.809 --> 01:30:57.990]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:05.364]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.364 --> 01:31:08.608]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.608 --> 01:31:13.413]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.413 --> 01:31:19.820]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:22.043]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.583 --> 01:31:22.883]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:22.883 --> 01:31:23.383]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.383 --> 01:31:24.063]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.063 --> 01:31:25.344]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.344 --> 01:31:27.584]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.488 --> 01:31:43.609]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:43.609 --> 01:31:48.751]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:48.751 --> 01:31:57.854]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:05.781]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.781 --> 01:32:14.643]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.643 --> 01:32:19.284]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.284 --> 01:32:30.086]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.726 --> 01:32:40.228]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.228 --> 01:32:45.670]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:53.151]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:55.552]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:05.171]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.171 --> 01:33:08.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:08.812 --> 01:33:28.297]  You know, sometimes I have these shows
[01:33:30.487 --> 01:33:39.850]  In fact, it's Sunday more often than not that I get angry, petulant, and I don't think do a very good job, because I get in here and I read all this news before I go on air.
[01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.371]  And then I just get frustrated.
[01:33:42.371 --> 01:33:44.351]  Why does America have to be run like this?
[01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:57.636]  Why do we have to have hundreds of mainstream publications announcing global government, run by private banks, and still I've got to see national hosts make fun of me for talking about world government?
[01:33:57.636 --> 01:33:58.596]  I've had nightline here.
[01:33:59.662 --> 01:34:13.932]  I've had MSNBC here, all of them, Politico, New York Times, Rolling Stone, you name it, and I'll say, yeah, there's a world government, and they go, you really believe there's a world government being formed by private interest?
[01:34:13.932 --> 01:34:22.799]  And I'm like, here, let me show you 20 mainstream news articles calling for a global corporate government that's exactly what we said was coming, and show you documents proving it.
[01:34:23.419 --> 01:34:25.341]  And they just say, no, I don't want to see that.
[01:34:25.341 --> 01:34:26.962]  I'm here to interview you.
[01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:36.490]  See, they want to keep it like in this fantasy world, like, well, we choose to say there isn't one of these tyrannical governments forming, and you choose to say you believe it.
[01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:38.532]  I don't believe it.
[01:34:38.532 --> 01:34:39.393]  I know it.
[01:34:40.874 --> 01:34:48.906]  I don't believe every major vaccine manufacturer out there has been caught adding cancer viruses to vaccines on purpose.
[01:34:48.906 --> 01:34:56.557]  I am literally up to my eyeballs in documentation and did a whole news show Friday on it.
[01:34:57.861 --> 01:35:00.163]  That by the way is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:00.163 --> 01:35:10.532]  That section of InfoWars Nightly News is up there for everybody as most of the show ends up a day or two later ending up on InfoWars.com or PresentBeta.com of InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:35:10.532 --> 01:35:13.254]  It's shock cause of cancer revealed.
[01:35:13.254 --> 01:35:16.257]  You might want to go watch it.
[01:35:16.257 --> 01:35:18.679]  And again, I'm supposed to just calmly sit up here.
[01:35:20.322 --> 01:35:41.122]  When I have government and corporate and foundation documents where they admit they were going to do this to the population and then now they've done it and the cancer rates have tripled, I keep saying doubled, that's in the last decade or so, they've actually tripled since 1980 on average and I showed all those numbers and UN numbers and I mean they're killing us.
[01:35:41.863 --> 01:35:51.770]  And instead I'm supposed to just give money to some cancer treatment charity or shave my head and go jog for people with cancer, which is fine, but why not talk about why it's epidemic?
[01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:54.172]  Why little kids are dying everywhere from it?
[01:35:54.172 --> 01:36:02.698]  I'm supposed to just sit here and be calm and talk about how bad Obama is all day instead of how bad the entire system is.
[01:36:03.138 --> 01:36:04.840]  I want it to stop.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.281]  I'm not a chump.
[01:36:06.281 --> 01:36:07.562]  I'm not a sucker.
[01:36:07.562 --> 01:36:09.023]  I'm not a schmuck.
[01:36:09.023 --> 01:36:10.304]  I'm not an idiot.
[01:36:10.304 --> 01:36:11.505]  I'm not a mark.
[01:36:11.505 --> 01:36:13.467]  I'm not here to be a slave.
[01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:15.688]  I'm not here to be an idiot.
[01:36:15.688 --> 01:36:21.133]  I know what's going on because it's in my face and I don't like it!
[01:36:21.133 --> 01:36:22.194]  Alright, I said I'm going to your calls.
[01:36:23.666 --> 01:36:26.788]  But I'm like somebody who goes through a buffet and puts too much on the plate.
[01:36:26.788 --> 01:36:29.089]  Called Aaron in here, had him on about two minutes.
[01:36:29.089 --> 01:36:31.930]  Luke Radowsky on, founder of We Are Change, great patriot.
[01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:35.592]  He's reported for some large national news outlets like RT and others.
[01:36:35.592 --> 01:36:37.293]  He's on with us right now.
[01:36:37.293 --> 01:36:41.175]  He's been in and out of the week-long demonstrations there in New York.
[01:36:41.175 --> 01:36:42.416]  There were a bunch of arrests.
[01:36:42.416 --> 01:36:43.616]  Some say 80, some say 100, some say 20.
[01:36:45.117 --> 01:36:45.597]  I don't know.
[01:36:45.597 --> 01:36:47.719]  I've got a bunch of articles about it.
[01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:49.180]  I know you've been there off and on.
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.921]  Peaceful people trying to demonstrate.
[01:36:50.921 --> 01:36:54.304]  Nowhere in lower Manhattan is it allowed, just like China.
[01:36:54.304 --> 01:36:56.265]  But oh, it's okay because we're America.
[01:36:56.265 --> 01:36:57.926]  And so you don't protest Wall Street.
[01:36:57.926 --> 01:37:01.269]  And the media is calling them communists, and certainly some of them are communists.
[01:37:01.269 --> 01:37:05.232]  But nobody's a bigger communist than Wall Street with their tens of trillions of bailout money.
[01:37:05.532 --> 01:37:10.059]  Stealing our cash and Wall Street funding socialism to steal our money.
[01:37:10.059 --> 01:37:13.884]  So yeah, there's some dumb commies on the ground protesting their bosses, yes.
[01:37:13.884 --> 01:37:18.191]  But I'm told, Luke, most of these people are in the fetters that really know what's going on.
[01:37:18.191 --> 01:37:19.513]  Luke Radowsky, tell us what's happening.
[01:37:20.043 --> 01:37:25.067]  Most of these people are caring, loving Americans who want this system to end, screwing everybody over.
[01:37:25.067 --> 01:37:32.474]  Sadly, when all the action was going on yesterday, I was actually on the other side of town, but I ran to Union Square where all the arrests were happening.
[01:37:32.474 --> 01:37:42.402]  I actually got an interview with one of the people who survived the police beatings and escaped those orange nets, those orange nets that the NYPD hasn't used ever since the Republican National Convention.
[01:37:42.922 --> 01:37:43.563]  I don't think so.
[01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:02.484]  We're good to go.
[01:38:25.445 --> 01:38:29.048]  So right now, what I hope to see is a larger number of people who are going to fight back.
[01:38:29.048 --> 01:38:34.172]  We're going to come out to Liberty Plaza right now, and they're going to show people that we're not going to stand down.
[01:38:34.172 --> 01:38:38.655]  The more numbers we have, the better the situation is going to be out there, and they can't stop all of us.
[01:38:38.655 --> 01:38:43.419]  Well, what's amazing is, Luke, this was going on before you even came to Austin on Monday and Tuesday.
[01:38:43.419 --> 01:38:48.723]  You'd already filed video reports of demonstrations a week and a half ago, and they would block most of lower...
[01:38:51.127 --> 01:38:53.929]  Manhattan around Wall Street so he couldn't get into it.
[01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:58.972]  Now, for over a week, they've been trying to stop any demonstrations anywhere.
[01:38:58.972 --> 01:39:04.857]  And our government criticized China for blocking protests.
[01:39:04.857 --> 01:39:07.138]  How can the New York police act like this?
[01:39:07.138 --> 01:39:09.520]  I know you've even gotten permits before.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:13.062]  I've been with you when New York cops say, we don't care if you have a permit.
[01:39:13.062 --> 01:39:14.143]  You're not going to demonstrate.
[01:39:14.143 --> 01:39:16.805]  I mean, this is really a shameful situation.
[01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:25.778]  I mean, the NYPD is getting orders from high-level government officials to stop and quail this movement, this resistance, and that's why they're acting this way.
[01:39:25.778 --> 01:39:37.669]  Many officers, I mean, the people there are giving the officers coffee, water, even food, and they're telling them, you know, you are a part of that 99% who's being screwed over by the 1%, and we are here standing with you.
[01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:39.231]  Your pensions are going away.
[01:39:39.231 --> 01:39:41.473]  Sadly, that message has not been heard, and people are
[01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:45.296]  So you go up and give the cop coffee and then they beat your head in and laugh at you?
[01:39:45.296 --> 01:39:50.780]  Well don't worry, the cops are going to lose their pensions and they'll love it.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:54.303]  It'll all go to foreign banks and that's what they want.
[01:39:54.303 --> 01:39:57.445]  And they want the dollar devalued, so?
[01:39:57.445 --> 01:40:01.488]  They're like, here I can beat your head in, don't matter Rothschild, take my money.
[01:40:04.152 --> 01:40:05.733]  It's ridiculous what's happening right now.
[01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:12.918]  There's some signs of good things happening, of police officers secretly letting some people let go when other officers aren't watching.
[01:40:12.918 --> 01:40:16.641]  So not all police officers are that bad, but what we saw is the worst yesterday.
[01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:29.029]  And we're trying to show people, you know, this has to stop, and this can only stop if... But look, just to confirm here, Luke Radowsky on the ground in the middle of all this, off and on the last week and a half, um, Luke,
[01:40:30.239 --> 01:40:35.566]  Because they're reporting peaceful demonstrators are being drug off.
[01:40:35.566 --> 01:40:36.828]  Yeah.
[01:40:36.828 --> 01:40:39.632]  Grabbed by the hair, some even pepper sprayed.
[01:40:39.632 --> 01:40:41.214]  You can see the videos online.
[01:40:41.738 --> 01:40:50.784]  Total draconian, total police abuse of power with people who are just wanting to stand in the street, who want to just walk and get their message heard.
[01:40:50.784 --> 01:40:55.227]  Our message does not get heard by the corporate mainstream media, but now we're finally getting attention.
[01:40:55.227 --> 01:40:59.530]  So this is going to backfire on the NYPD because of their brutality.
[01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:03.112]  And I hope more people come out, more people hear about what's happening and make a stand.
[01:41:03.112 --> 01:41:05.033]  Because the bigger the numbers, the safer we are.
[01:41:05.033 --> 01:41:07.875]  I learned this from Barcelona when they were doing similar movements.
[01:41:08.155 --> 01:41:13.117]  Whenever there was a low turnout, the police would come and beat the crap out of everybody and kick everybody out.
[01:41:13.117 --> 01:41:16.458]  And we've got word that they're planning on doing this soon in New York City.
[01:41:16.458 --> 01:41:21.360]  But they can't get rid of thousands of people if we're all there at once, peacefully standing.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:25.501]  Okay, so this is going to happen right now, all info warriors in the New York area.
[01:41:25.501 --> 01:41:26.742]  Where do they converge again, Luke?
[01:41:27.361 --> 01:41:31.184]  Liberty Plaza by City Hall, right by, right in between Wall Street.
[01:41:31.184 --> 01:41:35.928]  We're all there, you can't- What do you think, you're gonna stand at the Liberty Plaza?
[01:41:35.928 --> 01:41:38.310]  What do you think this is, America?
[01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:41.073]  Let's beat the people up at the Liberty Plaza!
[01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:44.632]  I hope to see as many people out there as I can.
[01:41:44.632 --> 01:41:47.114]  There's so many amazing people from all walks of life.
[01:41:47.114 --> 01:41:49.836]  And I have to say, this is not even a protest, but it's a movement.
[01:41:49.836 --> 01:41:50.476]  It's a culture.
[01:41:50.476 --> 01:41:56.381]  It's a new way of life of people coming together, helping each other, living side-by-side, feeding each other, clothing each other.
[01:41:56.381 --> 01:41:58.022]  Very un-American to demonstrate.
[01:41:58.022 --> 01:41:59.583]  I can't believe you're doing this, Luke.
[01:41:59.583 --> 01:42:03.466]  Luke Rudowsky, fire out the websites for folks to find out more about WeAreChange.
[01:42:03.466 --> 01:42:09.811]  Just go to youtube.com forward slash wearechange and we're going to be following your reports about what's happening in Occupy Wall Street as it happens.
[01:42:10.646 --> 01:42:11.486]  Well done, my friend.
[01:42:11.486 --> 01:42:12.127]  Appreciate you.
[01:42:12.127 --> 01:42:13.927]  We'll talk to you tomorrow more on this.
[01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:17.069]  Okay, I gotta get to at least 10 of these calls or so.
[01:42:17.069 --> 01:42:19.710]  Everybody's been patiently holding.
[01:42:19.710 --> 01:42:21.551]  The very same banksters are imploding.
[01:42:21.551 --> 01:42:23.312]  Europe noticed each bailout.
[01:42:23.312 --> 01:42:25.493]  They only need more money after that.
[01:42:25.493 --> 01:42:26.973]  Things only get worse.
[01:42:26.973 --> 01:42:28.334]  Six weeks to save the euro.
[01:42:28.334 --> 01:42:32.215]  Chancellor's warning after another day of financial turmoil.
[01:42:32.215 --> 01:42:35.497]  All over Europe, they're running around not going along with this.
[01:42:35.497 --> 01:42:39.519]  No matter how many pensions you get rid of or how much government you cut,
[01:42:40.598 --> 01:42:43.279]  You're not ever gonna get rid of the derivatives.
[01:42:43.279 --> 01:42:47.181]  The bankers set this up to hold the world hostage.
[01:42:47.181 --> 01:42:48.641]  And the same thing's happening here.
[01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:53.443]  When we come out of break, I'm giving each caller one minute to make their peace.
[01:42:53.443 --> 01:42:54.024]  I'm moving on.
[01:42:54.024 --> 01:42:58.926]  I will get the Barry, TJ, Jim, Benjamin, Jerry, Will, Kathy, Brian on the other side.
[01:43:00.831 --> 01:43:02.012]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:43:02.012 --> 01:43:08.939]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:43:08.939 --> 01:43:11.501]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:43:11.501 --> 01:43:16.886]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:43:16.886 --> 01:43:19.929]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:43:19.929 --> 01:43:22.231]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:43:22.231 --> 01:43:25.574]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[01:43:25.774 --> 01:43:28.475]  And America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:43:28.475 --> 01:43:31.856]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:43:31.856 --> 01:43:37.638]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:43:37.638 --> 01:43:39.278]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:43:39.278 --> 01:43:40.579]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:43:40.579 --> 01:43:43.240]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.461]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:43:47.461 --> 01:43:50.042]  You can find the video at www.barron.com.
[01:43:50.182 --> 01:43:54.267]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:43:54.267 --> 01:43:58.131]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:58.632]  Number two,
[01:44:10.285 --> 01:44:15.189]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.930]  It's true.
[01:44:15.930 --> 01:44:20.794]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:20.794 --> 01:44:21.635]  Number 3.
[01:44:21.635 --> 01:44:25.218]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:25.218 --> 01:44:29.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:29.922]  Number 4.
[01:44:29.922 --> 01:44:32.684]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:32.684 --> 01:44:36.367]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:44:36.367 --> 01:44:36.608]  Number 5.
[01:44:37.148 --> 01:44:41.291]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:44:41.291 --> 01:44:46.335]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:45:00.365 --> 01:45:01.947]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:45:01.947 --> 01:45:05.390]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:07.973]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:45:07.973 --> 01:45:11.036]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:45:11.036 --> 01:45:11.836]  Very different.
[01:45:11.836 --> 01:45:15.340]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:21.781]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[01:45:21.781 --> 01:45:24.022]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:45:24.022 --> 01:45:28.123]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:45:28.123 --> 01:45:31.784]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:38.145]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[01:45:38.145 --> 01:45:40.005]  So everyone needs food security.
[01:45:40.005 --> 01:45:42.346]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food
[01:45:42.446 --> 01:45:44.528]  That's right.
[01:45:44.528 --> 01:45:47.131]  Every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.
[01:45:47.131 --> 01:45:53.437]  Get stocked up with the best storable foods out there with eFoods Direct and be prepared for any emergency before it happens.
[01:45:53.437 --> 01:45:56.099]  To take advantage of this special call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:46:01.311 --> 01:46:03.032]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:46:03.032 --> 01:46:08.335]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:46:08.335 --> 01:46:09.876]  Saving means to make money.
[01:46:09.876 --> 01:46:18.661]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:46:19.401 --> 01:46:26.923]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:46:26.923 --> 01:46:34.924]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:46:34.924 --> 01:46:42.325]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:46:45.066 --> 01:46:45.906]  Coast to Coast.
[01:46:45.906 --> 01:46:47.747]  Direct from Austin.
[01:46:47.747 --> 01:46:50.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:17.035]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.035 --> 01:47:19.697]  You bet your bottom devalued dollar it is.
[01:47:19.697 --> 01:47:22.779]  By the way, I went over to Romeo's to eat Italian food with some of the crew.
[01:47:23.865 --> 01:47:24.906]  Let's go ahead and go to Barry in Texas.
[01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:47.871]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:47:47.871 --> 01:47:48.871]  Welcome.
[01:47:48.871 --> 01:47:49.931]  Okay, hello, yeah.
[01:47:49.931 --> 01:47:50.592]  Good to talk to you.
[01:47:50.592 --> 01:47:54.653]  I met you at the, uh, PSA, uh, protest at the state capitol.
[01:47:54.653 --> 01:47:55.733]  It was awesome.
[01:47:55.733 --> 01:47:57.094]  The storming of the capitol?
[01:47:57.094 --> 01:47:57.574]  Yes.
[01:47:57.574 --> 01:47:58.454]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:58.454 --> 01:48:01.396]  We didn't get a pyramid and grovel outside.
[01:48:01.396 --> 01:48:02.236]  We stormed it.
[01:48:03.055 --> 01:48:06.018]  It was awesome when we saw Chupacabra Dewhurst there.
[01:48:06.018 --> 01:48:16.310]  I was just going to just underline something he said about Ron Paul that, you know, people that work a lot will bring up politics and say, yeah, I would vote for Ron Paul, you know, except they say he can't win.
[01:48:17.029 --> 01:48:19.790]  And obviously, you know, I take an opportunity to explain to him, but why not?
[01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:23.771]  You know, I mean, he's, uh, he's either number two or three, depending on which poll you look at.
[01:48:23.771 --> 01:48:27.352]  And, uh, I kind of try to explain to him that they're just basically going along with what they've been told.
[01:48:27.352 --> 01:48:31.774]  It's like telling a child Santa Claus isn't real or it's a magician trick.
[01:48:31.774 --> 01:48:35.675]  The magician is not really putting swords through his beautiful assistant.
[01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:45.418]  And when they say Ron Paul can't win when he's number one, number two, or number three in every scientific poll, is a total mind game, and the people doing it are scum!
[01:48:46.399 --> 01:48:48.564]  And the people buying it are idiots!
[01:48:48.564 --> 01:48:49.305]  I'm sorry.
[01:48:49.305 --> 01:48:54.076]  I'm just sick of pe- I'm like, that's a scam, it's a parlor trick, wake up to it!
[01:48:54.076 --> 01:48:55.279]  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish up, Barry.
[01:48:55.913 --> 01:48:58.515]  Well, the other thing I was going to say, the co-worker told me a story about his wife.
[01:48:58.515 --> 01:49:00.176]  He and his wife went in for a routine check-up.
[01:49:00.176 --> 01:49:01.457]  She was six months pregnant.
[01:49:01.457 --> 01:49:08.941]  And the doctor there, who saw his wife, he knew, walking out, that he was going to be lambasted with pressure to get a vaccine.
[01:49:08.941 --> 01:49:12.444]  Because it just was sign after sign, get your vaccine, get your vaccine, get your vaccine.
[01:49:12.444 --> 01:49:14.005]  So he went in there, he was prepared.
[01:49:14.005 --> 01:49:16.987]  He told his wife, look, we're not going to get the vaccine they're going to offer to us.
[01:49:16.987 --> 01:49:18.047]  And she was like, well, why?
[01:49:18.047 --> 01:49:23.571]  And he tried to explain it to her, you know, because I don't want the baby to be exposed to any toxins or the preservatives, whatever.
[01:49:24.051 --> 01:49:32.778]  But the doctor became very upset and she said, well, you're going to have to sign a waiver and if anything happens, you're going to be responsible because the baby's going to be born during flu season, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:49:32.778 --> 01:49:34.800]  And he said, OK, fine, we'll sign the waiver.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.581]  You shouldn't have.
[01:49:35.581 --> 01:49:40.304]  Listen, listen, I've had dozens of medical doctors on until three years ago.
[01:49:40.304 --> 01:49:43.087]  They always said, don't give a pregnant woman a vaccine.
[01:49:43.087 --> 01:49:45.128]  It causes miscarriages and brain damage.
[01:49:45.128 --> 01:49:47.330]  And now they say, give it to pregnant women.
[01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:48.111]  It's on the day.
[01:49:48.111 --> 01:49:50.713]  It's on the insert not to give it to the women.
[01:49:50.933 --> 01:49:56.256]  You don't have to sign a waiver saying you've done something wrong with that piece of garbage doctor.
[01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:57.517]  They're like Nazis, though.
[01:49:57.517 --> 01:50:01.400]  They've committed this evil, like leeches and everything else, for so long.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.761]  They're going to defend it as it gets more and more brazen.
[01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:09.065]  But you notice with Perry, it's now a national issue, him sitting there with the forced inoculation.
[01:50:09.065 --> 01:50:09.925]  I'm sorry, finish up.
[01:50:09.925 --> 01:50:10.906]  So what happened with the doctor?
[01:50:11.687 --> 01:50:23.817]  Well, yeah, so she tried to make him feel really guilty and as soon as they stepped out to get another procedure done, she saw one of the technicians, I guess, who gives the vaccine and the doctor said, hey, she needs a vaccine and pointed at his wife.
[01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:31.224]  And the wife just looked at her husband and he kind of was like, he said he didn't want to blow up in front of everybody, but he was furious and he looked at the doctor like, we just talked about this.
[01:50:32.044 --> 01:50:33.805]  They treat you like animals!
[01:50:33.805 --> 01:50:36.507]  They tell you it's the law to take it in school when it's not!
[01:50:36.507 --> 01:50:37.728]  They're criminals!
[01:50:37.728 --> 01:50:47.354]  They admit that the seasonal flu shot doesn't even protect you from flu, and doubles your chances of getting the next season flu, and three consecutive shots doubles your chance of Alzheimer's.
[01:50:47.354 --> 01:50:48.494]  Look it up!
[01:50:48.494 --> 01:50:49.675]  This is eugenics!
[01:50:49.675 --> 01:50:51.056]  I appreciate your call, Barry.
[01:50:51.056 --> 01:50:53.478]  TJ in Minnesota, hosting on 93.5 Shortwave.
[01:50:53.478 --> 01:50:54.098]  Go ahead, TJ.
[01:50:54.098 --> 01:50:54.418]  Go ahead, TJ!
[01:50:59.991 --> 01:51:00.872]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:51:00.872 --> 01:51:02.533]  Yes sir, welcome.
[01:51:02.533 --> 01:51:06.856]  Yeah, I'll say my piece in 45 seconds or less.
[01:51:06.856 --> 01:51:08.857]  I wasn't mad at you, I'm mad about the doctor.
[01:51:08.857 --> 01:51:16.743]  I'm mad about the doctor lying and saying take a flu shot when that criminal knows the insert says it'll probably kill that baby better to hammer.
[01:51:16.743 --> 01:51:22.968]  And the government now recommends you give pregnant women shots because it's a form of forced abortion and sterilization.
[01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:24.188]  It's eugenics!
[01:51:24.188 --> 01:51:25.870]  I'm sorry, they're murdering us!
[01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:27.171]  Go ahead, I'm sorry, TJ.
[01:51:28.444 --> 01:51:31.085]  That's okay, I only wanted 45 seconds.
[01:51:31.085 --> 01:51:33.146]  Go ahead!
[01:51:33.146 --> 01:51:36.068]  I got two points, the second one's more important than the first.
[01:51:36.068 --> 01:51:42.031]  I'm very apolitical and you and I and most of your listeners know that our vote doesn't count.
[01:51:42.031 --> 01:51:45.972]  I've met Ron Paul, he's a nice guy, but does he have a standing army?
[01:51:45.972 --> 01:51:47.053]  A fort?
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:52.603]  Air defense artillery to keep him working if he was to be a president?
[01:51:52.603 --> 01:51:55.125]  Okay, listen, he'll be injecting ideas.
[01:51:55.125 --> 01:51:56.726]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[01:51:56.726 --> 01:51:59.989]  And so by him running, we win, exposing the whole system.
[01:51:59.989 --> 01:52:02.190]  If you just have an attitude, one guy's got to fix it all.
[01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:03.491]  It's never going to happen.
[01:52:03.491 --> 01:52:07.534]  Ron Paul, by running, is illustrating all their dirty tricks.
[01:52:07.534 --> 01:52:14.739]  Okay, I want to go to the second point, because you said it the other day, and it's more important than politics ever was.
[01:52:14.739 --> 01:52:16.580]  I believe, and I've watched
[01:52:17.662 --> 01:52:25.108]  populations and censuses and I fly over Asia and Mexico and the U.S.
[01:52:25.108 --> 01:52:41.980]  We've been depopulated heavily for 10 or 15 years to an Armageddon-like state and you said that the other day and you're the only man I've ever heard say that with authority and I think that you and I are correct.
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:45.823]  All you've got to do is start reading obituaries and looking at the birth columns or
[01:52:47.757 --> 01:52:50.038]  Sir, I gotta jump, but look, the U.S.
[01:52:50.038 --> 01:52:51.959]  life expectancy has dropped.
[01:52:51.959 --> 01:52:55.741]  And that's with all the drugs they do to keep you alive, it's still dropped.
[01:52:55.741 --> 01:52:59.423]  And then before, about 30% or more of babies died.
[01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:07.247]  So now when you take the average of the high infant mortality rate out and add it back in, our life expectancy's dropped by more than 15 years.
[01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:14.871]  Okay, to quantify that, if you made it past being a young child in the old times, then you live longer on average, if you go back 100 years ago.
[01:53:16.091 --> 01:53:18.112]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Arkansas.
[01:53:18.112 --> 01:53:18.972]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:53:18.972 --> 01:53:19.892]  Go ahead.
[01:53:19.892 --> 01:53:21.433]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:21.433 --> 01:53:25.134]  Did I understand you earlier this week to say that you were in Hot Springs last Sunday?
[01:53:25.134 --> 01:53:26.674]  Yeah.
[01:53:26.674 --> 01:53:30.055]  You didn't buy a local paper, did you?
[01:53:30.055 --> 01:53:43.119]  Last Sunday's Arkansas Democrat Gazette has a front page article below the fold that talks about the state legislature has just passed a law requiring all water systems serving 5,000 or more people to install fluoridation systems.
[01:53:43.812 --> 01:53:44.853]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:53:44.853 --> 01:53:47.755]  And of course, you have some of the best water in the country in Arkansas.
[01:53:47.755 --> 01:53:50.496]  Those deep aquifers, volcanic aquifers.
[01:53:50.496 --> 01:53:55.639]  But that's because all these cities are pulling the fluoride out, so then they try to pass a law.
[01:53:55.639 --> 01:53:59.102]  Guys, Google that.
[01:53:59.102 --> 01:54:02.644]  Arkansas legislature passes law requiring fluoridation.
[01:54:02.644 --> 01:54:07.367]  It's Act 197 of 2011.
[01:54:07.367 --> 01:54:10.729]  Well, I tell you, they want to make you... Listen, it's a fact.
[01:54:11.536 --> 01:54:14.517]  That the fluoride is massively increasing cancer.
[01:54:14.517 --> 01:54:17.078]  Just search fluoride cancer increase.
[01:54:17.078 --> 01:54:23.599]  And earlier, I got mad about the doctor saying to a pregnant woman, take your flu shot, when they're nothing but big farmer reps.
[01:54:23.599 --> 01:54:30.641]  The stinking flu shot has been proven to cause brain damage, birth defects, and spontaneous miscarriage.
[01:54:30.641 --> 01:54:34.802]  The stinking insert says don't give it to pregnant women.
[01:54:34.802 --> 01:54:36.843]  It's like a test to see what they can get away with.
[01:54:36.843 --> 01:54:38.123]  Yeah, there's the act.
[01:54:38.123 --> 01:54:40.024]  Wow, this is passed now in Arkansas?
[01:54:40.632 --> 01:54:42.914]  Yeah, this was in last Sunday's paper.
[01:54:42.914 --> 01:54:43.834]  Well, you know why?
[01:54:43.834 --> 01:54:47.877]  All over Canada, all over the US, all over Europe, they're pulling fluoridation.
[01:54:47.877 --> 01:54:52.221]  It's like five, six towns a week, cities, big cities are doing it.
[01:54:52.221 --> 01:54:55.103]  And so they're panicking and trying to make it the law.
[01:54:55.103 --> 01:54:58.005]  Wow, are folks upset about that in Arkansas?
[01:54:58.596 --> 01:55:04.839]  I haven't heard a whole lot, and I've started a new job, so I'm kind of out of touch right now, but I'm surprised I haven't heard more about it.
[01:55:04.839 --> 01:55:06.140]  Alright, I gotta jump.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:07.040]  I'll cover this more.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:07.681]  Wow.
[01:55:07.681 --> 01:55:09.622]  State-level forced fluoridation.
[01:55:09.622 --> 01:55:11.182]  That's not just a federal regulation.
[01:55:11.182 --> 01:55:12.403]  That's forced.
[01:55:12.403 --> 01:55:14.504]  These criminal scumbags.
[01:55:14.504 --> 01:55:15.585]  Oh, man.
[01:55:15.585 --> 01:55:17.226]  Benjamin in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:55:17.226 --> 01:55:17.606]  Go ahead.
[01:55:18.376 --> 01:55:20.578]  Yeah, they tried to do that to my sister.
[01:55:20.578 --> 01:55:26.425]  She was nine weeks pregnant, and they had two separate nurses come in and ask her, would you like the flu shot?
[01:55:26.425 --> 01:55:27.466]  No, okay, they walked out.
[01:55:27.466 --> 01:55:28.347]  Would you like the flu shot?
[01:55:28.347 --> 01:55:29.388]  Another one came in.
[01:55:29.388 --> 01:55:30.109]  No.
[01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:36.136]  Then the doctor came in, and he said, well, you're gonna get deathly ill if you don't take this flu shot.
[01:55:36.136 --> 01:55:38.198]  And I guess they were just trying to murder her and her baby.
[01:55:38.198 --> 01:55:39.139]  I guess, I don't know.
[01:55:39.139 --> 01:55:39.860]  I'm sick of it, though.
[01:55:40.373 --> 01:55:43.874]  Well, what they are is little control freaks who've bought in.
[01:55:43.874 --> 01:55:45.774]  Doctors are just like technicians now.
[01:55:45.774 --> 01:55:50.075]  They do whatever Big Pharma tells them through the American Medical Association.
[01:55:50.075 --> 01:55:55.196]  Just like doctors 80 years ago sterilized over 500,000 people under orders.
[01:55:55.196 --> 01:55:57.716]  Hitler got all those eugenics from the U.S.
[01:55:57.716 --> 01:56:02.477]  You wonder why in New York just five years ago they would test pesticide on poor children until they died.
[01:56:02.477 --> 01:56:03.757]  That's New York Daily News.
[01:56:03.757 --> 01:56:04.718]  The doctors were ordered to do it.
[01:56:04.718 --> 01:56:05.898]  They murdered little black kids.
[01:56:05.898 --> 01:56:06.298]  They love it.
[01:56:06.798 --> 01:56:09.282]  I mean, it's this power trip.
[01:56:09.282 --> 01:56:12.186]  Hitler's tyranny started through a medical tyranny.
[01:56:12.186 --> 01:56:15.491]  And it's all about forcing it on people.
[01:56:16.598 --> 01:56:17.738]  Well, I've never taken a flu shot.
[01:56:17.738 --> 01:56:19.179]  For some reason, I'm still alive.
[01:56:19.179 --> 01:56:20.240]  I don't think I need it.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:25.142]  Sir, they're coming out with hundreds of new vaccines and trying to have government mandated.
[01:56:25.142 --> 01:56:26.042]  Look at Rick Perry.
[01:56:26.042 --> 01:56:29.503]  Pull up the USA Today articles from 2007.
[01:56:29.503 --> 01:56:30.944]  We showed it Friday.
[01:56:30.944 --> 01:56:32.305]  He said, I order it.
[01:56:32.305 --> 01:56:33.025]  It's the law.
[01:56:33.025 --> 01:56:34.666]  You must take it.
[01:56:34.666 --> 01:56:39.428]  And millions of Texas children went and took it and many of them died or had convulsions.
[01:56:39.428 --> 01:56:42.629]  Now he says, well, it was just a recommendation and there was a waiver.
[01:56:43.399 --> 01:56:44.920]  A waiver for something that's not a law?
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.381]  It's all a con!
[01:56:46.381 --> 01:56:53.786]  If you want to know how criminal government is, even if you're for vaccination, go to a public school and say, I don't want to vaccinate my children.
[01:56:53.786 --> 01:56:55.408]  They'll say, it's the law, Mr. Johnson.
[01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:57.809]  And then say, I know you got a waiver.
[01:56:57.809 --> 01:56:58.830]  And the waiver's a scam.
[01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:59.390]  There's no law.
[01:57:00.247 --> 01:57:00.407]  I don't
[01:57:15.759 --> 01:57:18.780]  We're gonna beat this Nazi New World Order trash!
[01:57:36.568 --> 01:57:38.049]  We've got red blood.
[01:57:38.049 --> 01:57:44.272]  We're Americans and no amount of brain damage and cancer-causing fluoride or mercury is gonna stop us.
[01:57:44.272 --> 01:57:45.212]  God bless you all.
[01:57:45.212 --> 01:57:46.853]  I'll see you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:46.853 --> 01:57:47.533]  Central.
[01:57:47.533 --> 01:57:49.094]  Infowars.com!
