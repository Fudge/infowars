[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]  So in the first place, what we have to do is go on the offensive against what the government is
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.640]  doing here, because you're exactly right. This Capitol lie is what it is. It's the big lie about
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.000]  what happened at the Capitol on January 6th is being used to weaponize the CIA. It's being used
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.680]  to weaponize the FBI. It's being used to weaponize the DOJ. The entire intelligence apparatus, the
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.000]  entire national security apparatus is being marshaled to now target dissent, now being used
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.720]  to target right-wingers. This cannot be allowed to stand. And so you're exactly right. We have to
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.760]  strike at the core of that, which is the myth of this Capitol insurrection. And I think the biggest
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.720]  thing that people can do with a big platform is to share the message. And I see you've been
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.000]  spreading the message on InfoWars. I know Revolver has been talking about this. I think Tucker has
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.600]  been covering this. I've been covering it on the show. We've got to raise awareness about what's
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.400]  happening. But two, I think it's important that we establish the facts with Freedom of Information
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.960]  Act requests. That's a big part of it. And we also have to sue too, because if you look at these
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.640]  people that are being tried, tracked down by the FBI and these 470-plus defendants in these cases,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.160]  they've got to sue for wrongful prosecution. Because the guy that's running the investigation,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.000]  Sherwin, went on 60 Minutes while all of this was ongoing in January, and he laughed and said,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320]  yeah, well, we went after their internet celebrities first because we wanted to make
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.640]  sure that they weren't protesting at the inauguration. We wanted to make sure to
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.520]  basically scare them off and intimidate them. And then the people at the DOJ got on his case
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.680]  and they said, oh, yeah, you weren't supposed to say that, actually. There might be some trouble
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.680]  because of this.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:17.200]  Government is in place and is carrying out the orderly extermination of an overbloom
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.720]  of homo sapiens sapiens on the planet. That is the cover story in the halls of the United Nations
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.840]  and corporate governments. It's far worse than even that. A total genetic rewrite
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:47.280]  and a transfer of the planet from a carbon-based biological system into a silicon life form.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.600]  That is the revolution. That is the particular destination of what is known as the eugenics
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.960]  movement, which changed its name after World War II to the transhumanist movement.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.240]  And what we see coming out of the governing class all flows from that fount.
[00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:18.896]  A lot of people have contacted me in the last few weeks and said.
[00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:30.038]  You need to do a special roundtable event discussing the January 6th false flag operation.
[00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:53.502]  Because they're not even having their quote commission in Congress because the Democrats know the truth will actually come out about Jaden X and Anthony Ford by the hundreds dressed up like Trump supporters. And so I made the decision to at least do a special Saturday broadcast today, 6 p.m. Central, as it starts.
[00:03:53.518 --> 00:04:00.958]  To have a discussion about how that would be done and how that could be done with Pete
[00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:06.638]  Santilli, who's been set up by the feds and been through quite a lot in Oregon and in
[00:04:06.638 --> 00:04:11.938]  other areas with the Bundys, Nevada.
[00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:16.578]  And then, of course, we're going to have another person to try to put in prison, and that is
[00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:21.478]  Nick Fuentes, fresh off the big debate with Robert Barnes.
[00:04:21.478 --> 00:04:26.318]  He'll be joining us coming up in just about 45 minutes from now.
[00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:31.318]  First, we're going to talk to Mr. Santilli a little bit.
[00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:32.438]  So this is not the
[00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:39.435]  one six commission this is not the the actual breakdown today i i really want to get a bunch
[00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:44.555]  of experts together and and really codified and maybe like a three-hour special where we go through
[00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:51.915]  all the evidence consecutively because it is quite voluminous and you can say well one cop died a few
[00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:56.795]  days later from a stroke and then three citizens died it's still important but you're kind of like
[00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:01.515]  chuckie schumer alex making a big issue out of the january 6th thing when we've got forced
[00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:06.475]  inoculations world government 5g all the major infrastructure getting taken over by ransom
[00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:12.475]  hackers china threatening to nuke the us and i totally agree that january 6th is a blip on the
[00:05:12.475 --> 00:05:18.795]  radar i don't focus on it because i'm in the middle of it i focus on it because they're making
[00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:24.555]  it a big deal and using it to use the intelligence agencies and then the military has been used
[00:05:24.555 --> 00:05:31.195]  against al qaeda on the american people and this is a huge illegal shift of the whole police state
[00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:36.555]  on to the people that we knew it was always being built for and and and so that's really
[00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:41.355]  the big news that goes part and parcel hand in hand horse and carriage
[00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:52.573]  key and lock simpatico with the global passports with the global ids with the vaccine passports
[00:05:52.573 --> 00:05:58.013]  with the social credit scores so it all goes together but what happens is i come in here on
[00:05:58.013 --> 00:06:01.693]  the weekday shows and the commercials break the broadcast up some of that's good some of that's
[00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:06.973]  bad but it creates kind of an adhd field of the show because i'm trying to get to everything
[00:06:06.973 --> 00:06:14.893]  and frustrated the saturday long-form shows are very very popular because they always get millions
[00:06:14.893 --> 00:06:21.213]  of viewers which is quite a feat for an independent video channel thanks to all you spread the word it
[00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:25.933]  is your feat you're doing a great job in the info war i salute you and the crew is doing a great job
[00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:32.813]  making sure that we detonate the truth bomb and then you are the explosive we are the detonator
[00:06:32.813 --> 00:06:36.893]  and that's a good analogy for it peaceful information warfare
[00:06:38.733 --> 00:06:44.333]  but i was in here reviewing before i went live this morning and then this afternoon several hours
[00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:52.591]  on what's currently happening with the forced inoculation rollout the forced gene therapy rollout
[00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:59.711]  and all the new quote disorders that have popped up that are people becoming brain dead people
[00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:05.551]  having convulsions people getting alzheimer's when they're 15 years old that's it's all over the news
[00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:08.911]  we're like we don't know why suddenly all these people have neurological disorders oh they were
[00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:16.591]  all vaccinated but i mean it's crazy and so i was reviewing the last few days news and a bunch of
[00:07:16.591 --> 00:07:22.991]  stuff i didn't get to and one of these articles we could do three hours commercial free and go
[00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:27.711]  through every facet of it and it would just you could do three hours but instead i'm just going
[00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:29.231]  to hit as much of it as i can
[00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:42.853]  the u.n is trying to ban the use of ivermectin worldwide ivermectin in a whole bunch of studies
[00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:49.093]  and literally thousands of doctors from india to the u.s from japan to russia from the uk to chile
[00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:54.373]  i mean i've got it right here it's 99 i mean you give somebody ivermectin that's got one of these
[00:07:54.373 --> 00:08:01.013]  really bad viral infections and and if you get to them early it's 100 even people super sick it's
[00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:06.133]  like 98 you know they've been trying to suppress it here along with hydroxychloroquine but the
[00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:14.053]  story isn't that they're suppressing it you know that think about the evil and the organized crime
[00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:22.773]  level that all the doctors know it's incredible it costs 20 for a complete regimen you can take
[00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:27.493]  it prophylactically you can take it you know before you get infected to stop from being
[00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:35.653]  infected it's all there and the u.n is trying to block it because they want viruses to kill
[00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:42.213]  people i mean this is so much bigger than just the poison injections it's the u.n and big tech
[00:08:42.213 --> 00:08:48.453]  is in charge all over the world of what degree doctors can give with approved drugs as an antiviral
[00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:53.653]  you damn doctor give me whatever they want phones it's an approved drug but they don't want that
[00:08:53.653 --> 00:08:58.453]  because they want to make you take the franken shot and look i know you all know that but but
[00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:03.813]  just let that sink in and and this is the reason i can barely do my show this week because i was
[00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:09.653]  in a very angry mood all weekend i still am i feel like i'm not doing the best job i can because
[00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:15.013]  we're on the phone with well-known medical doctors that won't come on the show because
[00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:18.053]  they know they'll get in trouble but you can see other doctors that have come on the show and others
[00:09:18.133 --> 00:09:23.973]  that have gone public where they're seeing every woman that takes the the the the mrna shots is
[00:09:23.973 --> 00:09:29.413]  having a miscarriage none of these ob gbyns are seeing any babies delivered when the woman takes
[00:09:29.413 --> 00:09:32.853]  the shot but they're scared to go on air and talk about it even though it's come out and been
[00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:39.893]  confirmed by others so it's that level of you're thanking some doctor for telling you this but
[00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:44.453]  they're still too scared to talk that's why we're dying that's what you're supposed to speak out but
[00:09:44.453 --> 00:09:49.573]  see you can't because big tech and hospitals come after you because they're part of the criminal
[00:09:49.573 --> 00:09:56.773]  operation when tens of thousands of doctors say this ivermectin is 100 hydroxychloric one's almost
[00:09:56.773 --> 00:10:04.693]  100 this oral steroids almost 100 you you don't then fire them or sue them or or suspend them
[00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:12.453]  or ban them off the internet that's a crime and then i'm that's just one story of literally
[00:10:12.453 --> 00:10:16.853]  hundreds that are just as big i've got today i've got all the articles all the admissions all of it
[00:10:17.078 --> 00:10:27.798]  and so i've talked to like 10 medical doctors some of them i know personally that have reached out to us
[00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:32.678]  and i'm talking this week and i'm talking to all the other people the same thing and
[00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:36.117]  then i see the studies all confirming it and let me give you one more big thing
[00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:42.418]  remember a month ago it was a big deal but it got almost no attention
[00:10:43.218 --> 00:10:49.137]  Fauci testified to congress that half of the NIH that's the doctors and scientists have not taken
[00:10:49.137 --> 00:10:53.218]  the shots even though they were first in line to get it and were refusing and then i start hearing
[00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:58.658]  callers call in and they're going yeah my dad works for the defense department and they just
[00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:05.058]  acted like they gave him a shot but didn't i've talked to people that it's the same way i know
[00:11:05.058 --> 00:11:07.058]  doctors and medical people and nurses
[00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:14.711]  that I personally talked to and it's just a side note of oh yeah none of us are taken
[00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:18.591]  at the hospital we just scored at the trash can and yeah we know it's really hurting people
[00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:22.591]  it's crazy but we're scared to speak out and yeah we're seeing a lot of people die from
[00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:29.451]  it and I'm just sitting there I'm just sitting here hearing this they won't take it but they're
[00:11:29.451 --> 00:11:34.471]  having lotteries on TV with Governor Newsom like it's an IQ test up there going oh you're
[00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:39.891]  gonna get $1,000 if you take the shot you get $1,000 and you get $1,000 and he's smiling
[00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:46.991]  like some jack-o'-lantern American psycho on steroids I mean he just oozes evil and
[00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:52.771]  then his actions are evil and it's yeah yeah all these different executives are dying
[00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:58.071]  famous people you name it the VP of Oracle died he was in great health 50 something years
[00:11:58.071 --> 00:12:06.511]  old took the second shot died of COVID no you died of the injection so people say well
[00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:11.031]  just get to the news you'll actually get to it all there's no way I just covered two things
[00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:15.971]  just mentioned them to you that took five minutes here here let's let's just try it
[00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:22.431]  this way here because it would be really hard here's a big new presents you talking about
[00:12:22.431 --> 00:12:26.991]  killing everybody here's the NN Bar Association trying to block the UN from blocking ivermectin
[00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:32.831]  since when the hell look at that right here did the UN get involved in what drug your doctor can
[00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:39.791]  give you that's freaking world government man and the same head of the UNWTO WHO vaccine program
[00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:43.871]  this lady's on video admitting vaccines don't work and are killing everybody back in December
[00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:48.351]  of 2019 and saying they don't know what to do because they're told what to do by the big banks
[00:12:49.231 --> 00:12:52.831]  but now she's on board she's like oh don't let those Indians have ivermectin
[00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:58.351]  we need to we need to kill that's killing people the damn vaccine doesn't help you it kills you too
[00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.591]  man I tell you this is insane look at this headline it's happening and it's probably
[00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:11.151]  spreading Canadian health officials baffled by mystery deadly brain disease oh and all of
[00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:13.791]  the symptoms is what the vaccine does
[00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:20.916]  and the scientists say it seems to be communicable people that aren't even
[00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:24.076]  vaccinated are catching it
[00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:30.489]  and it's all hiding in plain view that's an rt article posted on info wars.com and then there's
[00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:40.329]  this gigantor article that dr sherry tenpenny sent us from the german government the bundes administration
[00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:48.828]  that's their parliament law for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in humans
[00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:55.468]  infection production act 21 vaccines and it's updated just recently they passed this
[00:13:56.588 --> 00:14:02.188]  that they're allowed to infect you with live microorganisms inside vaccines and then it's
[00:14:02.188 --> 00:14:03.308]  now federal law
[00:14:03.538 --> 00:14:11.938]  that they are now allowed to give you a contagious injection that you spread to people
[00:14:13.298 --> 00:14:17.618]  then i've got all the articles like oh we've got vaccines that give others the vaccines
[00:14:17.618 --> 00:14:22.258]  that'll stop the refuse nicks and then we go hey we don't want that they go shut up it doesn't exist
[00:14:23.058 --> 00:14:27.058]  hey they're planning vaccine passports here's the documents shut up jones is insane
[00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:31.058]  you need vaccine passports there are no vaccine passports you need vaccine passports
[00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:34.418]  that's gaslighting like you punched somebody in the nose they're bleeding you go you just
[00:14:34.418 --> 00:14:38.658]  broke my nose no i didn't you're crazy hey everybody in the room tell bob we didn't just
[00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:44.178]  break his nose everybody goes you're crazy bob i'm a weak-minded people they'll think okay i'm
[00:14:44.178 --> 00:14:48.418]  nuts you didn't break my nose that i'm crazy no you just got punched in the nose
[00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:59.016]  why do you think they're passing laws like that and i went this day when i saw this and found another law
[00:14:59.016 --> 00:15:03.656]  the eu passed two years ago saying the same thing they got it all set up it's a bunch of lawyers
[00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:07.976]  well i don't care if you pass a law saying you can give people deadly stuff that spreads to me
[00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:12.376]  and others hitler passed a bunch of laws he could do a bunch of evil crap hell we had laws that black
[00:15:12.376 --> 00:15:18.936]  people were two-thirds human i say that law needs to have its our ass wiped on it excuse me
[00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:26.216]  it's a load of crap because when you take somebody else's rights away you better damn believe you're
[00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:34.216]  the one losing it next let's see my defense of everybody's rights is not even because i'm the
[00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:39.736]  sweetest nicest little bleeding heart person i know this universe is connected and what we let
[00:15:39.736 --> 00:15:43.096]  them do to everybody around the world the third world people you don't think i don't know they're
[00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:46.376]  not winding up the third world turning them into a weapon you don't think i don't know they're not
[00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:50.856]  brainwashing to be anti-white you don't think i don't know all that but we just can't then kill
[00:15:50.856 --> 00:15:55.656]  all those people just because the globalists brainwashed them we've got to reach out to these
[00:15:55.656 --> 00:16:01.896]  people because you know who's watching folks the big guy and we don't turn things around by becoming
[00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:06.376]  the enemy see that's how satan wins he gets evil people to do bad stuff and then we adopt their
[00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:14.136]  tactics to beat them and we've just become who we're fighting that's not how we win this we win
[00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:19.016]  it by the understanding of the globalist system and by the people go oh it's too complex let me
[00:16:19.016 --> 00:16:24.536]  tell you people aren't dumb they're lazy i know men that know everything about their job and
[00:16:24.536 --> 00:16:27.896]  everything about sports and everything about how to make money but they sure as hell don't know
[00:16:27.896 --> 00:16:35.016]  what you're talking about when you talk about carbon dioxide being a life-giving gas they
[00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:38.696]  look at you like you're a weirdo because they heard it's bad you better figure out real quick
[00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:43.336]  what that's all about because if the global government wants to cut the carbon dioxide off
[00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:50.296]  they want to cut the oxygen off dumb ass you know that doesn't make sense why they want to do that
[00:16:50.296 --> 00:16:55.736]  because they say they're going to rewrite the whole planet it's a takeover and i don't know
[00:16:56.376 --> 00:17:02.376]  who's behind it but it's anti-human and it looks as alien as it gets oh my bible tells me there's
[00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:06.376]  a fallen entity here that would do this exactly as the bible says where the world government
[00:17:06.376 --> 00:17:12.056]  market the beast all this oh and now it's happening oh wow we got warned didn't we
[00:17:13.096 --> 00:17:18.296]  think i've been warning you for 27 years god's been warning us for thousands of years
[00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:24.450]  you think god's going to give us free will and then put us in here without a cheat sheet
[00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:31.230]  god gave us the damn cheat sheet to send us into the test hey you kids got free will but
[00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:38.190]  here listen to me here's the cheat sheet there's a there's a creature wants to kill your ass
[00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:45.310]  because you're better than him and he knows it he wants to take his time with you all right
[00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:51.230]  let me get to this report because it gets into the flavor of all this and the times we're in
[00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:57.150]  and then i'm gonna go to break for a moment with the clip we're gonna come back with pete santilli
[00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.790]  who again years ago
[00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:08.010]  was a funny talk show host and an interesting talk show host and he thought that I was
[00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:14.590]  full of it warning him that these militias were led by feds and he would get sucked in
[00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.710]  by some of the feds that would go Alex just doesn't like the militia no I love the Second
[00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.470]  Amendment I believe in the militia when you've got feds setting up militias to discredit
[00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.090]  militias I'm going to expose them but of course the feds doing that are they going to say
[00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:35.910]  I'm the fed no I'm not the fed and it's not bragging but listeners always ask this like
[00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:41.530]  Jones who are your sources how do you know all this I'm mainly the source I spend all
[00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.510]  day researching this most people in government and intelligence agencies do the minimum they
[00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:51.770]  can for money and for what their bosses want to hear I work all the time so let me tell
[00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:57.190]  you who my source is Alex Jones let me tell you you know where the CIA tunes in right
[00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.730]  you know where the Russians tune in the Japanese you know everybody tunes in right you know
[00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.430]  who Tucker Carlson tunes into and Joe Rogan and Elon Musk you know where they tune in
[00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:09.970]  right they tune in right here and I've known that for a long long time but there's this
[00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.010]  ongoing thing online where people are like
[00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:22.150]  my gosh well he he's getting all this information he must be getting it from the pentagon and yes
[00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.950]  i've gotten information from people but usually it's just confirming what i already know or giving
[00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:33.270]  me an a guest or an expert to talk to and the reason i bring that out here is not to brag to
[00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:41.030]  you it's to say you can learn all this stuff too this is not magic see real intelligence is what
[00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:46.070]  you actually see on the ground it's not what you hear inside an intelligence agency that's some
[00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.790]  of the biggest bull there is the intelligence agency said i was a russian agent the intelligence
[00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.190]  agency said trump was yeah we're russian agents like we're chinese jet pilots from mars
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:02.740]  you don't even your gut tells you that's not true but it doesn't matter it changes the subject
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:08.420]  for them onto us instead of them who are the anti-human agents they're not shycom agents
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:15.700]  they're not they're satanic agents see there's only two kind of agents god's agents and the
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.460]  devil's agents and then there's one other group people that try to stay out of the fight and
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.860]  people that try to stay out of the decision making process that call themselves neutral
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:34.580]  no one is neutral in the universe in fact when you call yourself neutral you have now accepted satan's
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.300]  rule
[00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:42.750]  and decided to not even use any of the satanic power of the world for yourself
[00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.350]  so you're really the biggest dumbasses in the world I mean at least a real
[00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.469]  Satanist knows what they've done so make no mistake those of you out there that
[00:20:52.469 --> 00:20:55.229]  think you're staying out of things you're a winner no you're called a loser
[00:20:55.229 --> 00:21:03.709]  what did God say you were hot nor cold so I spit you out of my mouth
[00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:11.629]  all right talk about synchronicity talk about serendipity talk about whatever you want to
[00:21:11.629 --> 00:21:12.070]  call it
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:21.219]  yesterday on air i said i'm coming in saturday and i'm doing a show on the false flag that was
[00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:26.980]  january 6th and i said we're going to call this first show is just a discussion about
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.020]  how we should do a larger program or a larger symposium maybe in a hotel ballroom or something
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.899]  that goes for two days i don't know but draw a lot of attention to it to get congress to do it
[00:21:36.899 --> 00:21:41.540]  to get governors to do it because january 6 is important because it's the mo of the future
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:51.379]  it's oklahoma city 2.0 it's 9 11 2.0 it was a synthetic operation and it was run by
[00:21:52.899 --> 00:21:57.219]  large leftist foundations through u.s intelligence agencies that were ousting
[00:21:57.219 --> 00:22:02.179]  trump and bringing in biden for the whole new posture of saying homeland security will work
[00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:06.580]  with the pentagon of the cia to go after the american people and all trump supporters as
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.219]  terrorists that's been announced that's in congress congressman nunas the ranking republican on the
[00:22:11.219 --> 00:22:15.060]  intelligence committee in the house has been in the meetings but it's also on the news where they
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:20.100]  say we're going to use the pentagon on the american people well pete santilli's already
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:25.540]  had a chance to enjoy army special operations assigned to the fbi arresting him so we'll be
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.500]  talking to him come up here in a few minutes but that's what's really going on here is the war
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.340]  against america they're going to stage a race war then claim anybody that's still a constitutionalist
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:41.540]  or pro-gun is a racist because they know people aren't going to join a a a civil war to get the
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:47.860]  guns but if it's a civil war to fight the racists they will so i said we're going to have this first
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:53.699]  show this first discussion with pete santilli then um others are going to be coming on like
[00:22:53.699 --> 00:22:58.260]  nick fuentes who they're also trying to put in jail over this and we're going to have a discussion
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.500]  about how we can move forward this isn't the main january 6th commission i saw on a saturday
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:08.179]  talking about it but it's funny i walk in here a couple hours ago and i see one of the researchers
[00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:15.540]  drew in his office and he's got headphones on it says bill maher false flag january 6th i said
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.820]  take your headphones off and i said let me guess he's saying oh all these crazies say january 6th
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.100]  was staged by the left and then he goes in and makes fun of how dumb republicans are he goes yeah
[00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:33.060]  you don't look like oh you've seen the video no i hadn't seen it it's formulaic but i wanted him
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.739]  to just know that's how formulaic this is that i hadn't seen this last night i didn't know about
[00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:44.340]  this i i went ahead and watched it right before i went on air and it's exactly what i thought
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.419]  because they're scared he's told the talking points to put out bill market sound really
[00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:53.939]  reasonable really nice he's a he's got high q scores he's very charismatic he's very smart
[00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:57.939]  and he writes a lot of his own stuff but a lot of this is handed down to him so what does this
[00:23:57.939 --> 00:24:03.780]  tell you that he's up there saying it's ridiculous no one dressed up like trump supporters and set
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:10.340]  him up because that's why they didn't have their commission and i was on santilli's show yesterday
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:16.100]  morning talking about it was a thursday i forget it all blends together talking about how that was
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.179]  indeed the case and he was agreeing and we were talking about trying to do more shows to expose
[00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:24.340]  this because it isn't just january 6th it's the whole posture of the government saying
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.739]  the american people are enemy and joe biden last week saying white supremacy is the number one
[00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:33.219]  threat not fentanyl killing millions not open borders not disease not china threatening to
[00:24:33.219 --> 00:24:38.820]  nukes uh not all the the satanism and the pedophilia the vaccines tainted killing all
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:46.659]  these people no the issue is white supremacists killing black people what maybe 10 black people
[00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:50.980]  get killed a year by nutty white people who are white supremacists i mean seriously white
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.620]  supremacist killing people's really really rare unless it's the white supremacist bill gates and
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.739]  the globalists they're actually killing people all over the world and oh biden has special vaccines
[00:25:00.739 --> 00:25:06.980]  he's sending just to africa told you that was coming oh we've got special ones for you we've
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.060]  caught them oh so so while you're killing the black people at planned parenthood and everywhere
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:17.139]  with your deadly vaccines oh but i love you and those evil hillbillies he makes fun of the
[00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:20.659]  hillbillies because some of their teeth aren't perfect they don't have 50 million dollars like
[00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:25.219]  bill maher and you know they live in trailers those idiots and you know they live on 100
[00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:29.620]  acres too aren't they dumb they got a pond and they're living great oh oh those dumbasses that
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:36.100]  don't want hollywood don't want new york they want to live out in the woods and they have dogs and
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.060]  they've got children and there it is yeah oh yeah because the last thing they want is everybody
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.300]  coming to this country to become farmers again black folks anybody they want you in their cities
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:52.899]  under their control so i thought i'd play uh last night just three and a half minute excerpt of false
[00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:58.580]  flags and he pretends to dress up like a trump supporter attack the capital and then when we
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:05.699]  come back i'm gonna hit a few examples of jayden x the day before the day of it inside the capital
[00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:11.780]  saying let's burn this mother effort down and jade next we now know got 90 000 from the media
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.739]  not 70 000 including cnn and he went in with the cnn camera people that were posing as somebody
[00:26:16.739 --> 00:26:23.139]  else with state department connections and videotaped all the key stuff and all that's
[00:26:23.139 --> 00:26:27.780]  going on and then you've got hundreds of people taking off their antifa gear they're black
[00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:34.100]  and putting on the maga gear and then you've got the q person not the q followers they're
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.340]  just people you know q announces he's against the new world order people go well i affiliate with
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:44.980]  that i have a magic relationship with the h-and board and then really that's the globalist giving
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:51.219]  you dates and things to discredit things and then trying to conscript you gets you to sign on
[00:26:51.939 --> 00:26:56.899]  to then oh there's something big's the capital you know it's gonna happen and then try to trick
[00:26:56.899 --> 00:27:01.540]  trump to go to the capital so he can be there right when they're provocateur people and people
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.100]  think they were under q's command break in after antifa breaks in and the police are ordered to
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.980]  stand down we had and then they had a big time magazine article where the left bragged how they
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:17.379]  sucked this in so it wasn't just antifa dressed up they were the shop troops that started it at
[00:27:17.379 --> 00:27:21.540]  nine in the morning hours before trump even spoke that was going on oh antifa was down there attacking
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.020]  the police then more came dressed like trump supporters then they as as the hundreds of
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:31.060]  thousands came from trump's speech down there they began to attack the larger crowd they started
[00:27:31.139 --> 00:27:36.659]  fighting back the police got the stand down order which is admitted and then 600 people walked in
[00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:41.460]  in between the velvet robes they've all been indicted but only 100 or so were violent and yes
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:47.939]  there were groups that infiltrated the proud boys they infiltrated the oath keepers and they
[00:27:47.939 --> 00:27:53.219]  infiltrated the boogaloos and they brag that's not the fault of the leaders like stewart-rhodes
[00:27:53.219 --> 00:27:58.020]  and people you got a big organization they had infiltrators like this fbi agent that i said watch
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.780]  he's been charged they'll drop that later they dropped it what monday
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:11.860]  see i've been down this rodeo a few hundred times and you can listen to me now america we can stop
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:17.300]  this or you can ignore what i'm saying and pete santilli will be a microcosm of your coming life
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.780]  because you may not go out and be part of one of these groups like santilli didn't got set up for
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:27.060]  nothing but look by the grace of god got out of it to tell the tale rarely do folks do that it's
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.219]  going to be the whole collapse of society and you're going to be bad because you were a republican
[00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:37.620]  voter period that's how they intend to do this is connect the republican party to white supremacy
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.939]  and the second amendment to it that's how they plan to overturn it that's the whole program
[00:28:41.939 --> 00:28:44.659]  you're seeing right now but the people are aware of it it's over
[00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.909]  and so here's Bill Maher
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:57.100]  desperately following his talking point because they're scared of this they're making fun of this
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.260]  because then they think oh you won't cover it because Bill Maher made a joke out of it
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.780]  but it's not a joke they make fun of what they're afraid of ladies and gentlemen all right so let's
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.700]  go ahead and go to this Bill Maher piece on the January 6 false flag this was already the subject
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:16.940]  of today's show as we told you yesterday but he beat us to it because this is now a key confluence
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.740]  we expose this it brings down their whole new agenda to turn the military industrial complex
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.740]  loose on the American people and here is their desperate attempt to drive us off of this subject
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:32.700]  here it is three-quarters of Republicans think that the riot the Capitol Hill riot was not
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:40.940]  Trump supporters out there they think it was actually liberals and Democrats dressed up as
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:50.780]  them making them I'm not making this up trying to make Trump look bad that we dress up as them
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.820]  so I just want to say to conservatives you got us
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.140]  you got us that's what we do
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:06.940]  we do we do it we dress up like you
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.940]  there's a costume department at George Soros's house Tim Robbins and I do the sewing and
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:22.860]  there's even a catalog now false flag supply if you want to as a liberal dress up to make
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:27.820]  Trump look bad just get the stuff here we have some of the things for example you could get this
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:33.580]  this distressed MAGA hat this is great because you want it to look like you know you've had it
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:41.340]  for a while but if you really uh if you really want to do well look like them get this Trump
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:50.060]  MAGA hat with the mullet with the mullet built into it you see there you go and then there's the
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.700]  if you really want to seal the deal you know dress up like them
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.420]  uh because it's all in the details uh get these meth keys
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:20.700]  and then if you really want to sell it okay so you know I mean a lot of the people who are Trump
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.460]  supporters they blow off their hand setting off firecrackers and doing other hold my beard dares
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:34.300]  so you get this fake rubber hand with the missing finger you see them a lot of them got missing
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:40.300]  limbs from fight for the country too you know about that would you uh and then
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.940]  you're also gonna need you know a lot of the liberals we're too in shape they get the Trump
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.940]  gut you know you put this right
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:59.100]  there's also oh there's the uh oh you want you want a misspelled hand sign this is
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:11.980]  oh again yeah it's in the details you want your copy of the constitution they always carry a copy
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.900]  make sure it's still in the packaging because they've never read it that's that's very important
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:24.620]  and finally not to leave the ladies out of this you want these are terrific these are
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.460]  Mike Pence earrings where he's you see he's hanging
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.380]  where's can I see that
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:47.340]  okay so they're definitely scared ladies and gentlemen of us looking at this and and and we
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.140]  are going to be looking at it Pete Santilli is a syndicated talk show host marine patriot
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.140]  he's been around for 10 years or more that I've known of him and he sent me a bunch of exhibits
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.540]  and things and we can do some of that about what he experienced how the fed tried to set him up but
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:05.740]  that's all come out now they had you know army brim berets shooting people in Oregon everything
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:10.780]  else trying to set people up they put him in prison for years uh but it came out that they
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.340]  set him up so he finally got out that's all there we're gonna do a longer show in the future and we
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.860]  got Nick Fuentes who they're trying to put in prison right now they're gonna put me in prison
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.500]  for January 6th as if I would provocateur an attack on the Capitol to discredit the fact
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.420]  we wanted a 10-day investigation there's no motive there and every time I talk about the
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.860]  left goes oh Jones is scared yeah I'm scared for the whole country you're absolutely right
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.540]  uh and I was there and I experienced what happened I experienced the secret service saying yeah
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.220]  Alex come out here you're gonna lead it I'm like secret service never gets involved in politics
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.300]  and again that was the deep state trying to set Trump up he figured it out at the last minute
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:49.660]  so did I uh so I was in part of a big part of history this is going to be as bad as Oklahoma
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:55.100]  City with hundreds of dead if they could have really tricked the Q people to storm en masse
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.460]  but 99 percent of the million people were there did not go in the building the media shows that
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:05.660]  mass it says they were all attacking no so we're gonna go to Pete Santilli but I want to play for
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:13.340]  you Jaden X who's now turns out got 90,000 dollars from CNN and a consortium of other media saying
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.500]  we're gonna storm the Capitol tomorrow we're gonna burn it then the next day he's in it saying let's
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.500]  burn it he wasn't going to burn it he wanted other people to burn it and they're part of the
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.620]  hundred or so Antifa that were there at 9 a.m attacking the riot police so that when Trump
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.220]  supporters arrived hours later they could be tricked into attacking them and the rest is
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.420]  history so here's uh Jaden X there's like five videos of this but I told him just pick one here
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.780]  here's one of him saying let's burn this mother effer down
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.220]  and there's so many people it's just they're gonna push their way up here
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.580]  bro I see people out there get hurt I don't want to see you get hurt
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.220]  I know we will make it we will make it
[00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:18.390]  so we have many many other clips of him saying that over and over and over again we're going
[00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:24.310]  to burn this mother effort down but I wanted to then also just show you the clip there's a bunch
[00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:30.710]  of these clips they try to take these off the internet everywhere and again that's an old
[00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:35.830]  headline it's down 90,000 that he sold it for and by the way he's put court filings in because it's
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:42.069]  been seized by the feds asking for it back so I wanted to update viewers and listeners on that
[00:35:43.509 --> 00:35:49.430]  here again is just one of the videos of Antifa off in the woods on the edge of the capital
[00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:57.670]  in their full black putting on the Trump gear exactly what Bill Maher says doesn't exist here it is
[00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:06.029]  again the camera goes up you see the footage right there and the person is
[00:36:06.029 --> 00:36:10.730]  obviously hiding it because Antifa comes over and tries to stop them there's the
[00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:15.170]  footage they did not want you to see
[00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:19.630]  and this is just the tip of the iceberg so I want to talk about
[00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:25.069]  the history of this why we know about this going forward we know the new head of the ATF
[00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:32.430]  actually helped cover up Waco and Oklahoma City with then Deputy Attorney General Holder
[00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:37.870]  and so again Pete Santelli thanks for coming on with us today this is just a first look we're
[00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:42.189]  gonna do a longer special on this soon I also want to get your take on how do you think we
[00:36:42.189 --> 00:36:46.990]  should all get together and have a big event to to really draw attention to this because it's
[00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:53.549]  much bigger than January 6th. Okay the other day when we were talking and and prior to that I was
[00:36:53.549 --> 00:36:58.029]  thinking about our interview and I said you know Alex Jones is the one that can kind of assemble
[00:36:58.029 --> 00:37:03.230]  a team especially with your contacts with constitutional attorneys a truth commission
[00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:08.990]  and we're noticing listen I understand the gimmickry that they're the charade in the
[00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:14.270]  legislature where the the House and the Democrats want to do a commission then they throw it to the
[00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.830]  Senate and the Republicans say they don't want a commission and then of course the Republicans get
[00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.950]  blamed for the cover-up when in fact I see it the other way around now let me show something to you
[00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:29.629]  here I'm going to show it to you on the screen this right here is all the evidence that I was
[00:37:29.629 --> 00:37:35.390]  able to acquire through the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge case the federal case the
[00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:42.589]  Bundy Ranch case and guess what I was able to to determine is that the same methodology by the same
[00:37:42.669 --> 00:37:48.669]  exact cabal has employed the same exact strategy these are black ops that well in advance of these
[00:37:48.669 --> 00:37:54.029]  quote-unquote organic protests that whether it be a Malheur or Bundy Ranch or January 6th for that
[00:37:54.029 --> 00:38:00.589]  matter they in well in advance of the events that seem to sprout up organically they're already in
[00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:09.629]  there manipulating they're controlling now before I went before they put me in handcuffs in in 2016
[00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:19.549]  2014 you know before the the Bundy Ranch incident I was a student of you know Ruby Ridge Waco I
[00:38:19.549 --> 00:38:24.990]  watched your documentaries when you were down there rebuilding but publicly stored sourced
[00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:30.350]  info that I was researching at the time when I was an outsider to all this gave me some insight
[00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:36.830]  as to their narrative scripting they're warming up to public three months in advance to them coming
[00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:43.870]  in and ultimately killing all the people at Waco but my involvement through Bundy Ranch and Malheur
[00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:49.230]  basically allowed me because all of us did not want to we didn't want to plead out we wanted to
[00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:54.750]  go to trial and essentially you got a master's degree in those three or four years in how they
[00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.830]  run these setups and how they manipulate groups and how they try to create violent outcomes
[00:39:00.189 --> 00:39:05.950]  absolutely analyzing tens of terabytes of information and this is what we ultimately
[00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:12.990]  ended up doing in Oregon in leftist Portland Oregon we were able to get a leftist jury to
[00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:19.870]  say that the only people that broke the law were people like operatives maybe possibly John Sullivan
[00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.710]  if he's on their payroll they're out there breaking the law the people that were at
[00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:28.270]  Malheur were FBI informants they're the ones that were breaking the law and that's why
[00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:33.549]  they acquitted the jury acquitted the defendants in Oregon I was dismissed from the case why
[00:39:34.189 --> 00:39:40.990]  because we caught them lying in their 302 reports but most people aren't as tough as you you spent
[00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:46.509]  years in jail them trying to flip you but you didn't flip that that's correct because we knew
[00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:50.430]  the truth and you know what the same thing applies and this has everything to do with what's going
[00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:57.629]  on January 6th it's the same exact methodology because guess what in Nevada we discovered that
[00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:03.790]  the U.S attorney's office was out at Bundy Ranch coaching the federal officers on how to get
[00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:09.790]  indictments same exact thing happened January 6th the U.S attorney that was bringing the indictments
[00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:15.870]  was out in the crowd and what they do in a color revolutionary style they bring in their operatives
[00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.870]  to provoke the crowd we've got it well docked I even have clips with me today if you wanted to
[00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:25.069]  play it I can tell you which clip to play these operatives were the ones that were instigating
[00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:29.149]  and bringing the barricades down because one and a half million people went right up against
[00:40:29.149 --> 00:40:35.229]  a bunch of today I just want to do a big gestalt as they say and then I want to come in the next
[00:40:35.229 --> 00:40:41.629]  few weeks and do more shows on this and then line up and then really put on the trial today I just
[00:40:41.629 --> 00:40:46.509]  want to discuss you as a victim of this and someone that persevered and made it out of it
[00:40:46.509 --> 00:40:52.670]  as a key witness not many go through this and ever make it out here's the here's the main reason why
[00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.589]  I wanted to speak to you about this and get the word out especially the same day you said we should
[00:40:56.589 --> 00:41:00.990]  have this commission I had a guy from revolver call me the day before saying the same thing
[00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:05.069]  I had one of my friends about a week before at dinner say you should have a people's commission
[00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:09.149]  because we know it's a false flag and I've been talking about it with my friends and family
[00:41:09.149 --> 00:41:13.390]  the same day so we're all kind of in the zeitgeist this needs to happen that's why we're doing this
[00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:20.109]  January 6th has all of the earmarks and we're talking about the administration the Obama
[00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:25.149]  administration and all their DOJ deep staters were the same ones that were behind the scenes
[00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:30.270]  on January 6th I can pretty much guarantee you that on these trips got a million people coming
[00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:34.430]  to town to say we know you stole the election how do they take that victory and turn it against us
[00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:40.029]  that's and they they did it but it didn't go as well as they wanted it was kind of kind of a dud
[00:41:40.029 --> 00:41:48.589]  a misfire Alex well I've seen reports I saw a FISA warrant this is in October prior to the election
[00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:55.950]  by the FBI doing foreign intelligence surveillance and then I discovered I put two and
[00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:03.069]  two together FBI's doing intelligence gathering and surveillance on foreigners then I see Ukrainians
[00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:07.790]  on the ground January 6th now it's completely wiped off the internet I was able to grab some
[00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:13.790]  screen grabs Gateway Pundit had it but guess what they were able to renew their FISA warrant so this
[00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:18.430]  is in advance of January 6th for those who don't know they like to use foreigners these false flags
[00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:24.270]  they use German intelligence operatives in Oklahoma City and Waco exactly now Ukraine has a huge
[00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:29.310]  heavily funded billions a year shadow army that they don't just use in Ukraine against the Russians
[00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:34.350]  they use it against the American people that's right now guess what all of this stuff now let
[00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:39.629]  me give an example of why it's important we get to the family members that they must provide support
[00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:45.710]  hey we need some help legally like President Trump formed America First legal group to help with
[00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:51.229]  unconstitutional legislation and and inhumane or unconstitutional stuff like holding even the Q
[00:42:51.229 --> 00:42:55.790]  shaman as a danger to society the reason why they're holding them is because they want to
[00:42:55.790 --> 00:43:01.710]  they want to put the full pressure on these people to get them to plead out why because guess what if
[00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:08.270]  you decide to go to trial 30 to 45 days prior to trial that's when all the FBI informant stuff
[00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.350]  comes out that's when all the exculpatory information comes out and that's when you
[00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:17.229]  really discover exactly what they were doing and that's how we were able to get the trial dismissed
[00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:22.830]  in Nevada exactly so you're sitting in the very place you were sitting the very place they're at
[00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:28.430]  right now exactly and it's important that we not only get them to support we need to get them out
[00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.229]  so that they can defend their cases prepare for trial and let's get them to support with a bunch
[00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:37.390]  of constitutional attorneys I'm even willing to volunteer my time because I know how to go into
[00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:42.430]  the discovery explain you spent years in jail able to go over all this and enable from what I
[00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:48.189]  read you were the one that educated the lawyers and really helped end all these cases that is
[00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:51.950]  another big element because if you picture this all of these defendants if there's hundreds of
[00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.710]  them I don't know how many there are they're assigned because they can't afford to spend
[00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:00.430]  two million dollars to defend themselves well they're assigned a seat what they call a cja
[00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.990]  attorney it's through the criminal justice act well they're on the government payroll
[00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:10.589]  they're working for the government and in most cases all they're ever doing and they've never
[00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:15.149]  even gone to trial the majority of the the attorneys that were handling our case never
[00:44:15.149 --> 00:44:21.390]  even took cases to trial and what their job is to do is to get a plea bargain and that's part of the
[00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:28.589]  cover-up is to cover cover up all of the misconduct the false flag operations the black operatives
[00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:35.470]  it's well documented let me give you an example of this CNN actually ran a piece where Amy
[00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:41.629]  Klobuchar was asking the Capitol Police head did you see a copy of this intel report on January 5th
[00:44:42.189 --> 00:44:47.149]  which was the night prior and he said no I didn't see that well the contents of that
[00:44:47.149 --> 00:44:52.910]  report is exactly the stuff that we exposed in the Bundy trial these are very detailed
[00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:57.549]  intelligence assessments and reports that are assembled by thousands of people within the
[00:44:57.549 --> 00:45:02.830]  deep state they've got access to fusion centers they've got access to human intelligence they've
[00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:08.189]  got access to online covert investigators throughout provoking people to go to DC
[00:45:08.189 --> 00:45:14.270]  all of this stuff gets fleshed out if they go to trial if you don't go to trial and they played out
[00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.790]  all that stuff gets covered up so we need and that's what I said two weeks ago that I was
[00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:21.870]  on your show that I see some clips of you were saying the same thing I'm like let's have this
[00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:27.870]  commission because even the Republicans just just put a few facts out it's over I mean we have them
[00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:33.950]  they literally provocateur this thing through Antifa and then through the Q forums trying to
[00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.870]  trick enough people that once the police stood down to go in that capital and that's what the Q
[00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:43.149]  people told them to do that's right and what we actually ended up discovering all the way up until
[00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:48.830]  trial you know a couple of years later is that they had withheld exculpatory information not
[00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:53.790]  just from us prior to trial but they withheld it from the grand jury they lied to the grand jury
[00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:59.069]  saying that Pete Santilli was a danger to society that Cliven Bundy was a danger to society well I
[00:45:59.069 --> 00:46:05.069]  have an intel report directly from the federal government the FBI Department of Interior and
[00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:12.350]  LVMPD that said Cliven Bundy wasn't even a threat that it was better to lure in all of his supporters
[00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:18.189]  and that's what they did at Bundy Ranch they spent months online trying to lure everybody in they did
[00:46:18.189 --> 00:46:23.629]  the same thing January 6th identically to what they did and explain the psychology because we see
[00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:29.310]  like Bundy thing as a victory hey leave a rancher alone been there for 100 plus years his family
[00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:34.350]  but for them that creates fear they can say here's the terrorists and those agencies get more funding
[00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:39.549]  and get to paramilitary their forces I'm going to tell you something right now a federal judge her
[00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:45.870]  name is Gloria Navarro she was working for Harry Reid when when Cliven Bundy and the remaining
[00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:51.470]  defendants went to trial and started revealing everything that's contained here they were in
[00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.830]  such a panic and by the way you sent me all the evidence of this I just don't know what
[00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:59.390]  to show first I've got federal records transcripts indictments I mean I've got
[00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:05.950]  you know what I want to show you I want to show you as a matter of fact if we can go to a clip
[00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:11.870]  if they can if they can pull this up pretty quickly I'm I'm sure that that they'll be able
[00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:18.750]  to reference it this way here's here's a January 6th report what is the number here hold on one
[00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.830]  second here's the thing Pete we're gonna do this in another show though because I want to be able
[00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.430]  to have a whole list and go over it in order because because I mean we know the evidence
[00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:32.750]  is there but I want to actually put it on in a more take a look at number 16 pull that up because
[00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:37.710]  it has to do with the and I you may not have seen this it was just released yesterday at the Red
[00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:43.549]  Pill expo stop the hate published this little montage but what you'll be able to see is
[00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:49.710]  thousands of people that are going up to the bike racks and and as they approach the bike racks well
[00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:56.109]  we're we're a law-abiding citizen ring um there were uh capital police officers nobody went past
[00:47:56.109 --> 00:48:01.710]  that until there were one or two provocateurs that started agitating the police and bringing
[00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:07.149]  the barricades down that was that first layer that happened all the way into the capital well
[00:48:07.149 --> 00:48:13.629]  this is exactly in a different form what they did at Bundy Ranch what they did at Mallier now
[00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:18.670]  uh what they did January 6th this is a well scripted well oiled machine where they only have
[00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:25.470]  to use four or five provocateurs to get a very energetic crowd to follow uh absolutely it's mob
[00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:30.189]  psychology let's just stop right there because we're taped to air it's like we're live teleprompter
[00:48:30.189 --> 00:48:34.750]  free but we're taping this to air at six tonight we only got up to clip nine so that's why I wanted
[00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.990]  to do this later is I have a skeleton crew and it becomes directing stuff on air becomes the
[00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:44.109]  whole broadcast but can you send us uh the the other clips because you know I don't know about
[00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:50.189]  this new clip just just tell us we can add it in post what is the uh a new thing on January 6th
[00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:57.950]  okay so so on on January 6th this is this is what we have I strongly suspect and we also have
[00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:04.910]  testimony uh in in Congress that the FBI sent an intelligence report that they were well aware
[00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:09.870]  and submitted a report on January 5th uh to the Capitol Police of what they were expecting
[00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:14.910]  to occur on the 6th now if you recall uh they accused President Trump of inciting a crowd to
[00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:21.710]  do stuff on January 6th when in fact they had intel reports from the 5th well to produce a
[00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:28.589]  report like that requires a huge effort all of that is in the discovery if people plead out
[00:49:29.149 --> 00:49:32.910]  and uh because they want to get out of jail they're being held against their will of course
[00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:38.350]  they'll never see those intel reports they'll never see the 302 reports they'll never see
[00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:44.589]  any of this information uh whatsoever no Alex we caught them red handed doing the following
[00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:50.270]  and I can I I will stake my life on this that the same people that were involved in this
[00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:59.390]  operation at the DOJ uh the FBI as well as their um their toothless quote unquote um uh uh FBI
[00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:06.509]  informants that those people were also involved on January 6th it's very very easy to expose them
[00:50:06.509 --> 00:50:13.549]  especially through our experience uh since 2014 doing this and I you know like I said I want to
[00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:17.390]  help get the word out in the following regard you know there's people like Robert Barnes,
[00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:23.390]  Norm Pattis uh they can help lobby and to get uh some assistance from some of these big law groups
[00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:28.189]  to get these guys out of jail and and get them the support that they need to take oh I said
[00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:33.229]  this four months ago Trump right when it happened Trump needs to go on the offense he needs to have
[00:50:33.229 --> 00:50:37.470]  his own commission because they're trying to hang this around his neck and say he did this
[00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:41.950]  when he had nothing to do with it it's outrageous they provocateur it and for people that don't know
[00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:47.310]  Pete I'm not against the average Q follower that people come and they go you know Q exposed the
[00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:51.790]  New World Order 30 years ago and I'm like no Q's four years old and they couldn't stop our movement
[00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:58.270]  so they tried to lead our movement with a disinfo op and now most people understand that but the Q
[00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.310]  movement was saying the storm is here we're going to storm the Capitol and I saw some of that thought
[00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:07.390]  well nobody's going to be dumb enough to do that but no there were people that were dumb enough to
[00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:13.710]  do it and and so let's go back to you you weren't dumb but you were involved with the militias as a
[00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:19.870]  reporter covering them what made you think I was the fed when I was warning you and others six seven
[00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:25.149]  eight nine ten years ago and and and trying to explain to you that that that I'd been through
[00:51:25.149 --> 00:51:29.870]  this a bunch and you know in the decades before that because you know the feds come and go I'm
[00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:35.390]  the militia leader Pete Jones is bad you're part of our group now you understand he's a fed I mean
[00:51:36.029 --> 00:51:42.189]  describe how they manipulate people well they I mean their FBI informants there's there was a
[00:51:42.189 --> 00:51:47.549]  report out two weeks ago that I saw that the FBI and their they need reform there with their
[00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:54.509]  their FBI informants they they have these people they're criminals they I got infiltrated
[00:51:54.509 --> 00:51:59.870]  uh by somebody who sabotaged our operation and was insistent exactly they recruit thousands
[00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:06.189]  and thousands just to go after us of sophisticated real con artist criminals that have had successful
[00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:10.589]  careers so you're that's how they're able to convince you because you're up against real con
[00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:16.189]  artist yeah you know there was a New York man uh in the uh there was arrested uh because of the
[00:52:16.189 --> 00:52:22.029]  quote unquote capital riot uh and they just released him because the FBI informant lied
[00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:28.350]  these FBI informants get paid thousands of dollars they get envelopes of cash and their job is and
[00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:32.750]  they're even allowed to break the law by the way and that recent report actually exposed that there
[00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:37.870]  were four thousand FBI informants that were allowed to break the law but they were providing good
[00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:44.189]  information well guess what that's it uh uh it's called entrapment essentially uh same thing that
[00:52:44.189 --> 00:52:51.470]  they did on January 6th is they spent probably uh months online when President Trump started
[00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:56.350]  announcing that we were going to do a rally on January 6th how far in advance of January 6th
[00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:02.189]  where he said uh be there it's going to be wild they immediately almost two months two months well
[00:53:02.189 --> 00:53:07.229]  guess what that operation and that intel report that was delivered on January 5th I can pretty
[00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:12.189]  much guarantee you same exact thing happened their people go to work they got online covert
[00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:17.470]  investigators I sent you documentation we'll be able to do this at a future date we caught them
[00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:22.670]  on social media antagonizing people sending pictures of the MRAPs that they had out there
[00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:27.549]  at Bundy Ranch telling people it's going to get hot you better come in the Q people that are
[00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:33.470]  antagonizing they're basically online covert investigators working for the FBI the people
[00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:38.590]  that are on the ground breaking the law any this is the number one indication that you've got
[00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:43.549]  somebody that's with the the FBI or they're an informant and they might not even look like it
[00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:47.790]  but they're on their payroll they're allowed to break the law if they don't get indicted
[00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:52.029]  number one number two they're breaking the law number one indication that you're standing right
[00:53:52.029 --> 00:53:57.870]  next to a fed they won't get indicted you will they need to wrap you into a conspiracy here's
[00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:07.229]  the main thing this these indictments at Mallier at Bundy Ranch January 6th as well they're reverse
[00:54:07.229 --> 00:54:14.189]  engineered they said to themselves how can we get a whole bunch of people arrested come January 6th
[00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:20.590]  and they basically just scripted and they mold shape guide and send everybody to the barricades
[00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:24.750]  so that Nancy Pelosi can step up to the podium to say that there was an armed insurrection
[00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:30.189]  now also here's another thing the media is complicit in this thing how do I know this
[00:54:30.189 --> 00:54:37.630]  because they were on the ground they were on the ground providing intel to the FBI they were also
[00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:44.990]  promoting a false narrative in the media to do what I spoke to the cameraman they were given
[00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:50.990]  shot lists they give they're given shot lists they want to take pictures of the least presentable
[00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:56.750]  we'll call them or you know the least sure but I mean it was CNN connected groups that were
[00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:03.470]  shooting the video for Jayne next and others that's right and so for them to say it's preposterous is
[00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:10.029]  ridiculous but I'm not gonna lie to people and say it was all Antifa they tricked sizable portions
[00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:14.430]  of people who identified as Oath Keepers most of them actually weren't Oath Keepers
[00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:21.950]  or as Boogaloo or as some of the other organizations like Proud Boys to go in and do it
[00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:26.830]  and then when you point out that oh you got infiltrated then they tell the members Jones
[00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:33.470]  just turned against Oath Keepers Jones just turned against the Proud Boys no I didn't I'm saying
[00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:38.350]  you've been infiltrated again I'm not saying like see I told you so Pete Santilli when I brought up
[00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:43.069]  that story I'm trying to understand the psychology of how they how these feds because people don't
[00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:47.470]  know this whole story can even convinced you because I used to warn militias I like the
[00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:52.029]  hatari militia I saw the guy in a gas mask and two guys behind like they're dictators going
[00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:56.189]  we're gonna fight the UN and world government we're gonna have a war and I remember saying
[00:55:56.189 --> 00:56:00.189]  that looks staged they're about to set up the hatari militia six months later they did set
[00:56:00.189 --> 00:56:04.269]  them up so it's very obvious when you see the scripting but you're a smart guy you're a marine
[00:56:04.269 --> 00:56:08.670]  you're a patriot how did you never get sucked in anything illegal but how did you get sucked
[00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:14.750]  into thinking I was the fed when I was saying you're getting set up or you're a fed no you know
[00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:19.390]  what I wasn't fully aware it literally until I got locked up and I looked at all the discovery
[00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:27.390]  and I you know all these discs again I was not aware of how criminally corrupt they are malicious
[00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:34.189]  prosecution entrapment misconduct and by the way that's not a conspiracy theory the judge specifically
[00:56:34.269 --> 00:56:40.509]  said this case is dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct for doing all those things now now I
[00:56:40.509 --> 00:56:44.990]  was never near nor would I participate in anything at any point in time I mean David Knight was there
[00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:51.549]  at Bundy Ranch Joe Biggs was out at Mallier I was at both places as well and I would never
[00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:56.269]  know you you were one-tenth as aggressive as a Black Lives Matter activist I mean you
[00:56:56.269 --> 00:56:59.229]  so so if you went to prison they should all go to prison for a million years
[00:57:00.189 --> 00:57:05.390]  no the ones that were breaking the law essentially would never come near me they had that they had
[00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:10.029]  this stigma against me Pete Santilli's uh you know he's a fed so people were staying away from me I'm
[00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:13.069]  like so is that part of your wake-up process because they should tell you I was a fed and
[00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:18.830]  then now they were calling you a fed they did it to to both of us I was infiltrated saying that you
[00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:23.630]  were you know out there saying I was a fed and then you were told that I was a fed but you know
[00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:28.750]  what I didn't need to contact you it was because because the stuff you were doing and saying
[00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:32.430]  I was either thinking you know this guy's either an idiot or he's a fed and I don't think you're
[00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:36.109]  an idiot I think you're a smart guy now that's why I was trying to understand how you were in
[00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:41.790]  the midst of this and didn't see they were going to set your ass up oh no I did not I was shocked
[00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:49.069]  actually when I got put in handcuffs on January 26, 2016 after they shot and killed Levois Fennicum
[00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:54.750]  I thought I was going to be released within 24 hours they wanted me so bad because I had reported
[00:57:54.750 --> 00:58:00.029]  that Hillary Clinton took 130 million dollars from Uranium One 10 hours prior Loretta Lynch
[00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:05.870]  signed off on my arrest warrant they wanted me so bad that they even had a witness come forth
[00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:11.870]  and make up a story about me conspiring with Anne and Bundy to take over the bird farm they flat
[00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:16.189]  out made it up we caught them and they actually dismissed and why were they so crazy why would
[00:58:16.189 --> 00:58:20.350]  they set up a checkpoint in the middle of the mountains and just shoot up a car full of innocent
[00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:26.029]  people well I was supposed to be in that convoy the reason why and by the way that's contained
[00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:31.630]  all contained here the reason why they selected that area it was in in a dead zone where I wouldn't
[00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:36.670]  be able to broadcast it out they told me that came out of court I've seen the documents oh yeah
[00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:42.350]  and the OSP which is the Oregon State Troopers they were they were all Oregon State Patrol they
[00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:47.549]  were told to turn off all their body cams then the FBI fired a couple of provocative rounds
[00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:53.390]  um and then they covered it up uh basically they fired the rounds you know what they do uh in at
[00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:58.670]  Bundy Ranch they kept them up all night they kept all of their BLM agents and and their National Park
[00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:03.309]  Service agents up all night they sleep deprived them and told them that the militia was going to
[00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:09.149]  come kill them uh so they tell the rank and file the good you know uh door kicker that's right the
[00:59:09.149 --> 00:59:13.710]  brainwashing in the military and the police is at the highest level against their own people when
[00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:18.590]  the left's taking over Alex I'm telling you here's another thing that we need to get out there and
[00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:21.790]  it's only going to come from us because it's not going to come from the government if they do an
[00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:28.350]  investigation the Bundy Ranch case was busted wide open you know why because a man named Larry Wooten
[00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:33.870]  who's a federal agent he was in charge of the case and he knew exactly what they do they were doing
[00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:40.670]  was wrong it was illegal it was malicious and he was the one that exposed this and it was through
[00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:46.590]  whistleblower on the inside we have those same great people at the Capitol Police that are have
[00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:50.830]  been compartmentalized they were told to do certain things they got information from their
[00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:54.670]  well that's why the feds yeah exactly the police were involved they were good guys they were put
[00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:58.990]  in a horrible position and and and I know we know some of what they're saying is absolutely a false
[00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:03.630]  flag they were ordered to go do traffic control they were told did not get reinforcements when
[01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:09.549]  Antifa was attacking them for three hours that's three hours before Trump's people ever even came
[01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:13.470]  incredible listen the way we end this right now and we're gonna do a whole new show on this
[01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:17.549]  and and we'll have time in the next week or so to get all the data together and collate it so
[01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:22.189]  it's all bam bam bam this is a special Saturday report just to just to get people's mindset you
[01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:27.149]  know in this general area and start thinking about it but in closing you're right whistleblowers are
[01:00:27.149 --> 01:00:33.870]  the key they're king and whether it's on big tech or the pedophile rings or corrupt government that's
[01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:38.269]  what keeps bringing them down and that's what's scaring the system so much so there is a lot of
[01:00:38.269 --> 01:00:42.830]  hope but but finally what do you make because you saw it you were there when we played it Bill Maher
[01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:47.149]  coming out making fun of false flag January 6th I mean that tells you the system's really concerned
[01:00:47.149 --> 01:00:52.670]  about this well yeah and you'll notice that see they they work hand in glove they get their
[01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:57.069]  cameramen to take a shot of a militia guy that doesn't look appealing and then he and then they
[01:00:57.069 --> 01:01:02.430]  throw it to Bill Maher and say put up a picture that makes us look less flattering let's demonize
[01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:09.390]  half of the population it is an anchoring that I've seen two or three times over now the media
[01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:14.910]  is complicit in this operation and it's easy to expose they're participating in the whole thing
[01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:18.990]  they're just handing it off to Bill Maher and then saying hey you need to make these guys look
[01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:23.790]  like a bunch of poop pots well guess what we want a full investigation we also want to see
[01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:29.710]  what Jayne Nex is CNN operative that was standing right next to him whether or not she was oh yeah
[01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:35.390]  we need to have we need to have subpoenas of CNN and of Anderson Cooper and of Jayne Nex I totally
[01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:40.830]  agree and again expanding on that final point they wouldn't be again having Bill Maher do this
[01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:45.309]  if they weren't scared so so I totally agree with you they wanted to use this but once they realize
[01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:50.350]  they can't even have a kangaroo commission because even a kangaroo commission this will come out
[01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:55.710]  that's why we need to have our own commission and actually cover it I have a final point guess what
[01:01:55.710 --> 01:02:00.509]  there's a blessing in disguise because if we submitted FOIA requests like judicial watch they
[01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:05.309]  get jammed up because of Hillary Clinton's emails over five or six years well guess what all of the
[01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:10.509]  information doesn't need to be FOIA it's it can be actually provided through discovery and all the
[01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:16.189]  cases right now there's hundreds of them we need to have a team of attorneys that helps coordinate
[01:02:16.189 --> 01:02:20.990]  and consolidate a joint defense and then let's start collecting all this data it's all going to
[01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:26.590]  come out in the discovery we need a class action suit by the 500 plus innocent people most of them
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:30.830]  because some did do dumb stuff okay charge them with a misdemeanor or whatever you know for
[01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.590]  for looting or whatever but the point is or crapping on Pelosi's desk even though I'd probably
[01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:38.269]  give them a medal I'm joking the point is no I don't want to crap on Pelosi's desk because it
[01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:42.830]  turns her into a victim folks we don't want vigilante stuff we want her to be charged for
[01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:47.710]  being a CHICOM agent and to go through due process but pulling back here the headline will be Jones
[01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:51.790]  says give a medal to those that crapped on her desk that was a joke I think they should actually
[01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:56.670]  get in trouble but should they be locked up in solitary confinement no we now have Elizabeth
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:03:02.990]  Warren months ago saying let them out or or put them on bond people just walk between the velvet
[01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:08.029]  robes and now the Russian foreign minister is concerned because this is China-esque if they
[01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:12.670]  can lock up 500 innocent people for just walking in the Capitol when the cops open the doors and
[01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:18.189]  put them in solitary confinement and not let them even have hearings and let the jail guards
[01:03:18.189 --> 01:03:24.350]  beat their eyes out they've been calling them white supremacists they're like having gladiatorial
[01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:30.350]  events where the white prisoners are beat up by the black guards on record I mean this is a
[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:36.750]  hellish situation in a DC dungeon sounds even far worse than where you were held so we need to
[01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:41.549]  the majority of the attorneys that are assigned to these defendants these Americans that are
[01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:46.189]  that are inside they don't even have trial experience they're they're assigned
[01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:51.710]  attorneys that have zero trial experience because their job is to put pressure on them get them to
[01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:58.830]  plead out but my attorney had 700 case files and only took a couple of cases to trial.
[01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:05.930]  Pete how do folks find you because listeners that care find this show they find your show
[01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:10.730]  but viewers and people need to realize out there you're not just like some side dish
[01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:15.310]  here you're the main course in the fight against the new old order I mean I mean folks you're
[01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:19.009]  not the potatoes you're the steak you know you're not the buzz you're the lightning you're
[01:04:19.009 --> 01:04:23.130]  not you're not the you know the big lighter you're the flamethrower the listeners need
[01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.529]  to know that it's when they tell people about it and then they tell people about it and
[01:04:28.529 --> 01:04:32.290]  that message that's the chain reaction the globalist wouldn't be censoring and doing
[01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:37.049]  all this if we didn't have hope we have more than hope if the people listen and take action
[01:04:37.049 --> 01:04:43.610]  so how do folks find your show all of my links are at Pete Santilli dot Moby and we need
[01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:48.290]  to get the word to these family members of these hundreds of defendants that they need
[01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:52.770]  to get out get them out of jail and let's start preparing for trial and let's get them
[01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:56.770]  the support that they need to win a trial because the truth will be exposed the worst
[01:04:56.770 --> 01:05:02.009]  thing that the deep state wants is for these cases to go to trial well you're absolutely
[01:05:02.009 --> 01:05:06.410]  right and I also you know hear people out there saying don't defend what they did or
[01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:10.569]  you're defending the attack on the Capitol I'm not defending idiots that got fooled by
[01:05:10.569 --> 01:05:14.610]  Q to go in with Antifa that was maybe a hundred of them that got violent but hundreds and
[01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:19.770]  hundreds that didn't know what was going on that just walked in and they're now for being
[01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:24.290]  between velvet ropes facing you know many years in prison in solitary confinement I'm
[01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:28.930]  not defending what happened it's the opposite I'm defending victims that if we let them
[01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:33.450]  be victimized we're all gonna be victimized Pete Santilli thank you so much and I look
[01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:37.810]  forward to having a larger symposium of some type in the near future on this because it's
[01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:42.730]  very very important yes sir thank you for having me thank you all right we're gonna
[01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:48.890]  go to a very short break here and then we're gonna come back with someone who they're also
[01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:53.650]  trying to put in prison for what happened at the Capitol on January 6 and that is Nick
[01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:58.730]  Fuentes stay with us there are now over a hundred peer-reviewed studies in just the
[01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:04.330]  last year documenting that surgical masks do nothing to stop the transmission and the
[01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:09.850]  spread of viruses it's a hoax it's a fraud here's another article on info wars.com a
[01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:15.609]  major German study showing exactly the same thing but Fauci knew that he wrote a study
[01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:22.590]  himself his name's on it in 2008 saying not only do masks not work but most of the deaths
[01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:29.170]  of the Spanish flu back in 1917 1918 were caused by people wearing masks and it breeding
[01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:35.569]  bacterial pneumonia in it they're filthy diapers many people dying have died of bacterial pneumonia
[01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:40.049]  and they call it COVID-19 and the criminal Fauci and others knew it all that's why it's

[01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:22.310]  All right Nick Fuentes joins us now and if you just tuned in I'm really just trying to
[01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:28.910]  talk to people that have been through the feds the globalist the Justice Department
[01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:32.390]  trying to set people up and really the Justice Department always had problems but once the
[01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:38.990]  Clintons took it over in the early 1990s it's been trying to set up the American people
[01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:42.710]  trying to set up populists trying to take what George Herbert Walker Bush did with Ruby
[01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:46.950]  Ridge and take it to the next level and so Nick Fuentes well-known talk show host with
[01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:51.910]  his America first movement this popular show they've been trying to set him up myself up
[01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:56.430]  President Trump up claiming we wanted to attack the Capitol that day but now the evidence
[01:07:56.430 --> 01:08:00.910]  is overwhelming that it was a lot of anti provocateurs and others that did trick a very
[01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.549]  small number of people out of the million that were in DC that day into going in and
[01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:07.590]  now they're not having their commission because I think they know that information will come
[01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:13.549]  I think we should talk more about this and also develop some plan to push for a commission
[01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:18.910]  so Nick thanks for joining us on this Saturday evening we know you're a busy guy being front
[01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:25.269]  and center at the middle of this along with myself and others what is your insider view
[01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:31.350]  Well my insider view is that you know what the Capitol has been characterized as is completely
[01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:35.590]  not what it was and I know you were there and I was there obviously and we were there
[01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:40.510]  throughout the buildup to that which was stop the steal in Atlanta and other places and
[01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:43.830]  the way that it's been characterized by the mainstream media and now by the government
[01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:48.630]  is that this was some kind of like you said coordinated planned assault or an attack or
[01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:52.790]  something and as we know that couldn't be further from the truth what happened was and
[01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:59.350]  my experience was I went to DC on January 6th for the rally on the ellipse that was
[01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:04.150]  an official presidential rally outside the White House sanctioned by the government of
[01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:08.150]  course and it was hosted by people that were a part of stop the steal from the beginning
[01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:12.230]  it was women for America first I know you were a part of that Ali everybody was there
[01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:16.790]  for stop the steal was there for the president's rally and I remember I was there and Donald
[01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:21.910]  Trump said on the stage we are now going to go peacefully to the Capitol to protest what's
[01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:27.030]  going on which was the counting of the electoral college votes and and so we went we walked
[01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:31.510]  over down to the Capitol I know you gave a speech out there I gave a speech out there
[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:36.550]  it was peaceful from where I was standing I didn't charge or breach or anything like that
[01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:40.550]  and I had no plans or intentions to I think that there were some people that maybe were
[01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:45.750]  overzealous there's some videos that show that police officers were letting people inside the
[01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:50.950]  Capitol flagging them down letting them inside telling them I saw there was one video that just
[01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:55.670]  came out recently a police officer said hey as long as you're not violent come right on in and
[01:09:55.670 --> 01:10:02.070]  hey we respect your right to protest this was a smart move yes exactly because now this has
[01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:06.710]  created the pretext for everything that we're seeing now which is the crackdown from the DOJ
[01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:12.630]  the FBI so the way that I see it is basically this was a big trap I think that they knew that
[01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:16.790]  everybody was going to be there in DC they knew that Trump was going to be at that rally they knew
[01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:21.830]  that he was going to sponsor that protest and so they set everybody up and then why was it that the
[01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:27.269]  you know remember Donald Trump said that he wanted National Guard that day and they
[01:10:27.269 --> 01:10:32.390]  turned him down he said we need thousands of National Guard in DC that day and they said no
[01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:36.070]  they didn't want it and so even though it was anticipated that there would be hundreds of
[01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:41.030]  thousands of people there the Capitol is totally undefended and what's more they were retreating
[01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:45.190]  back further and further into the that's right I've been to the Capitol many times even even
[01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:49.590]  last year and this year I mean I've been there probably 10 times it's usually crawling with
[01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:53.990]  police there were you there were nowhere to be seen except a tiny group of like 30 that were
[01:10:53.990 --> 01:11:00.790]  supposed to hold off you know maybe a few 400 500 rowdy people that were at the vanguard but still
[01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:08.230]  this was a setup by the system exactly it was a setup and and you can see clearly what the
[01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:12.950]  motivation was because what they got it's exactly what they wanted they got all these people that
[01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:17.110]  were peaceful people that you know look at the people that have been charged in this case I think
[01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:22.710]  you've got 475 something like that that's the number of defendants and I don't believe one of
[01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:27.430]  them was caught with a gun or charged with a gun so you had people that were protesting across the
[01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:32.790]  country in DC twice before that well exactly this is an insurrection to take over the government
[01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:38.150]  we would have showed up with machine guns and explosives and I mean and communications equipment
[01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:41.830]  we would have been taking over DC television stations I mean I don't want to do this but
[01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:46.390]  everybody wants to know how you do it you take over the TV stations you take a bunch of hostages
[01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:50.870]  and you take over the capitol and you don't let them leave and you and you start killing people
[01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:57.910]  okay you don't you don't show up with guys in shaman outfits yeah well yeah that would have
[01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:02.630]  been the worst insurrection in history right the one that had no planning the one that had no weapons
[01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:07.910]  the one that had no plan I mean you had people that went into the capitol led in by police and
[01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:12.950]  then were walking and staying between the velvet ropes in the rotunda taking pictures and selfies
[01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:16.870]  people went into the chambers of the senate they took their pictures then they left and that's
[01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:21.750]  supposed to be some kind of an attempt to overthrow the government that's supposed to be a coup to
[01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:25.990]  declare a new government or something and even if you shaman they're holding without bail who I
[01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:30.309]  think's a nice guy just you know you know got caught the moment we've all made mistakes he comes
[01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:35.670]  in and says a prayer he's totally polite to everybody right well and they're polite to the
[01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:40.790]  whole thing I mean there were some vandalism but we're not talking about take a look at what BLM
[01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:44.630]  did you want a football team a college football team wins there's more violence
[01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:49.990]  oh yeah or when a city wins a stanley cup or you know anything like that you want to see
[01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:55.269]  destruction you see cars on fire you see you see a world cup win you see a lakers win
[01:12:57.110 --> 01:13:01.910]  right you see smashed windows you see all kinds of things and that's not to say that some people
[01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:06.950]  didn't force their way in but people are taking a small thing they're blowing it wait up wait a
[01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:13.030]  minute this isn't as big as pearl harbor according to chucky shamer right yeah it's the worst since
[01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:17.830]  the civil war so this is worse than 9-11 this is worse than pearl harbor this is worse than
[01:13:18.389 --> 01:13:23.110]  the iraq war this is worse than the sinking of the lucitania i guess all of that combined right
[01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:26.710]  because you had some boomers walking through the velvet ropes taking selfies
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:32.150]  unallowed right i mean they're not allowed to do that it was an unauthorized tourist trip
[01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:36.790]  taking selfies inside the capitol and and the point is they know exactly what they're doing
[01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:43.269]  they know that when they invoke those words insurrection coup siege attack that's all very
[01:13:43.269 --> 01:13:47.910]  deliberate they know that they're creating a very particular kind of a characterization of those
[01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:53.510]  events so that they could get a very particular outcome which is if that is terrorism if that was
[01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:58.070]  a domestic terror attack then what becomes warranted is a new patriot act what becomes
[01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:03.110]  warranted is a new war on terror and and more jurisdiction for the federal government to spy
[01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:07.830]  prosecute to interrogate to detain people and you already see that underway with the capital
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:12.630]  defendants you've got people that are being charged right now with trespassing with disorderly
[01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:17.430]  conduct and they're being held in solitary confinement for five months and and we know
[01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:21.910]  that that is only the beginning they're going to take the tools that are that has sort of been
[01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:26.550]  implemented in an ad hoc way since the capital and they're going to institutionalize those and
[01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:30.630]  make those permanent and make it so that it is a permanent war on terror against right-wing
[01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:36.070]  dissent against trump supporters against any of these so-called emerging political narratives that
[01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:40.470]  could become violent or challenge the system misinformation it's all part of the program
[01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:44.070]  well that's it and what really scared the system was the million people that showed up in that last
[01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:49.350]  shot where you've got miles and miles of people i got there two hours into it trump had just
[01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:53.750]  finished his speech and i couldn't tell what was happening 100 yards ahead of me because all the
[01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:59.190]  crowds of people until like tear gas hit me in the face and so the idea again that any of the
[01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:05.430]  people that went into the capital later had no idea i just went over to the cops and i said uh
[01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:09.670]  we're not allowed to go on there no but it's all been breached and it's all in video and i go well
[01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:14.470]  that's terrible let me get on your speaker system i know you have an emergency pa system which they
[01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:18.630]  were using the next day to say no one's allowed to under martial law and i said or at least get
[01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:22.710]  your own people so they got a captain he said no we're not going to do that they could have gotten
[01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:28.470]  on the speakers before actually battle was killed and said get out uh donald trump says leave
[01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:34.070]  everyone would have left but they didn't do it did they didn't use the power of speaker systems
[01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:39.590]  in every hall in every area that is deafening 300 yards away on pennsylvania avenue you can hear
[01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:45.190]  this is a civil emergency no one is allowed on the streets after sex if you were seen you will
[01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:50.389]  be arrested that's the same damn system they had they could have just flipped the switch and said
[01:15:50.389 --> 01:15:54.389]  like like the principal at all students out of the building everyone out of the building
[01:15:54.389 --> 01:15:59.590]  you will be arrested everyone but instead they're like we're here for q q said we're arresting
[01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:07.830]  pelosi a few dozen morons and and again that's insane you have a pa system for a reason if
[01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:13.830]  there's a fire if there's an earthquake if there's a shooter they stood down who ordered the stand
[01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:19.910]  down that's the question that needs to be answered fundamentally because that's exactly what it was
[01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:25.750]  as a stand down if they wanted people to disperse if they did not want people in the capital there
[01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:29.990]  would be no way that you could know that because they didn't properly staff the capital and the
[01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:35.510]  capital police that were there fell back and fell back and retreated and the most famous video of
[01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:41.510]  that black capo police officer he's running and leading the crowd further inside the capital
[01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:46.790]  further inside the corridors and and multiple videos have come out showing police flagging
[01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:55.190]  people further inside opening the ropes outside and and opening gates waving people in yes yes
[01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:59.190]  and it's all on video and the evidence is all there and that's exactly the question that has
[01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:05.110]  to be asked is who gave the stand down order and why if this was an attack if this was terrorism
[01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:10.070]  if this was a coup why then would the police stand down and this was a supposed threat to democracy
[01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:15.990]  where politicians are are under attack and fear for their lives it was absolutely calculated
[01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:21.110]  and they're getting out of it exactly what they wanted and and i think to your point that's a big
[01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:26.630]  reason why they have shut down this january 6th commission i think that you know maybe they don't
[01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:31.750]  have it now or later or something but i think that they don't want this commission because already
[01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:37.190]  the lies are beginning to crumble like for example about the the capital police officer that allegedly
[01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:42.550]  died at the hands of the protesters brian sychnik new york times came out with that story a few days
[01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:47.350]  after the capital and said oh some police officer was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher and
[01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:54.070]  then arrived at the hospital dead and that was used by the way in the actual articles of impeachment
[01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:59.190]  in the u.s house of representatives that article was cited in the articles of impeachment to
[01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:04.389]  impeach donald trump on that same day and then since then the new york times retracted that story
[01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:09.030]  turns out there's no fire extinguisher didn't die the same day had nothing to do with that
[01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:14.150]  they later came up with this story about chemicals or bear mace or something that turned out to be
[01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:18.870]  not true but they needed something because they killed three citizens that day so let's let's pull
[01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:23.670]  back here i want to ask you this this this question second but first get this point in
[01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.990]  what do we need to do because you've got a lot of pull you know you're very successful smart guy
[01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:31.910]  people really like what you're doing nick uh you've got a big movement that'll listen to you
[01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:36.470]  i've got a big movement our listeners have got a big circle of friends they can talk to
[01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:39.670]  what do we ask trump to do what do we ask congressman what do we ask governors to do
[01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:45.590]  because this needs to happen because on the matrix or the skeleton of the hoax of january
[01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:51.190]  6 being this bloody insurrection the worst thing ever white supremacist all of it's a lie
[01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:58.710]  not a white supremacist event on on that fraud that foundation they're building homeland security
[01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:04.790]  fbi cia uh white supremacism is the main threat america first is her terrorist gun owners are
[01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:09.590]  terrorists let's have a race war let's have a domestic war this is their hope that they wanted
[01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:15.910]  at ruby ridge and waco and oklahoma to trigger the excuse for the feds to have a war with veterans
[01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:21.350]  and gun owners which is suicidal and insane but that's what they want to do what do we do that's
[01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:29.910]  first uh and then i've got this question for you trump needs to understand that he's the only one
[01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:35.510]  that knows who came to him and said have alex jones open the gates and lead the event three days
[01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:39.110]  or four days it was actually like a week and a half before i first heard it and i'm like yes we're
[01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:43.190]  talking to trump and he wants you to lead it i hadn't talked to trump in a while then and then
[01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:47.750]  you know woman's putting you know don jr on the phone all this stuff and then you're gonna leave
[01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:52.710]  with a bullhorn halfway through his speech to make sure it's peaceful and i'm like how am i
[01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:56.389]  gonna lead hundreds of thousands they go oh we don't think it'll be that we think there may be
[01:19:56.389 --> 01:20:00.309]  50,000 will come and the secret service and capital police are you know working with trump
[01:20:00.309 --> 01:20:05.190]  and you know trump's gonna have military there which we now learn he asked for so so trump
[01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:10.710]  clearly had all this together was gonna go speak and then the president says he's going somewhere
[01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:15.190]  where's the secret service they didn't show up where's the where's the capital police they know
[01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:20.550]  they cut the capital in half that day and and sent them on traffic control for trump's main event at
[01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:26.630]  the ellipse so this was a setup and in that and who did that because i was telling my wife sitting
[01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:30.630]  next to me i go i got a bad feeling i said there's no way the secret service can open that gate but
[01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:35.030]  i see the woman telling me this talking to secret service talking to the president's main people
[01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:38.230]  talking to all of them right there because i'm in the you know right in the row right there in front
[01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:41.750]  of trump and then they open the gate and waved me through the secret service waves me through
[01:20:42.389 --> 01:20:48.550]  obviously they weren't involved but whoever set that up was planning to set me up and the president
[01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:53.590]  and like i said it kind of petered out it was like a misfire so so that's another big area of
[01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:58.630]  investigation not just who ordered the shutdown uh not just who ordered the capital to open up
[01:20:58.630 --> 01:21:03.990]  not just who did that but also who's recommended that who got that ready because they wanted to
[01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:09.350]  get trump and me and you and all of us in one net thank god it misfired so go ahead and take
[01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:13.670]  that i'm gonna give you the floor the next 10 minutes sure so in the first place what we have
[01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:17.830]  to do is go on the offensive against what the government is doing here because you're exactly
[01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:23.990]  right this capital lie is is what it is it's the big lie about what happened at the capital on
[01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:29.990]  january 6th is being used to weaponize the cia it's being used to weaponize the the fbi it's
[01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:34.630]  being used to weaponize the doj the entire intelligence apparatus the entire national
[01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:40.790]  security apparatus is being marshaled to now target dissent now being used to target right
[01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:45.510]  wingers this cannot be allowed to stand and so so you're exactly right we have to strike at the core
[01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:49.990]  of that which is the myth of this capital insurrection and i think the biggest thing
[01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:54.710]  that people can do with a big platform is to share the message you know and i see you've been
[01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:59.670]  spreading the message on info wars i know revolver has been talking about this i think
[01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:03.510]  tucker's been covering this i've been covering it on the show we've got to raise awareness about
[01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:07.830]  what's happening but too i think it's important that we establish the facts with freedom of
[01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:12.469]  information act requests i know that that's already been submitted for example on behalf
[01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:17.590]  of ashley babbit and there should be foias submitted about everything else as well i paid
[01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:22.790]  the lawyer to do it and they're just stonewalling yeah well yeah and yeah that's a big part of it
[01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:26.870]  and we also have to sue too because you know if you look at these people that are being tried
[01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:32.389]  tracked down by the fbi and these 470 plus defendants in these cases they've got to sue
[01:22:32.389 --> 01:22:38.550]  for wrongful prosecution because the guy that's running the investigation sherwin went on 60
[01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:43.910]  minutes well all of this was ongoing in january and he laughed and said yeah well we went after
[01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:49.350]  their internet celebrities first because we wanted to make sure that they weren't protesting at the
[01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:54.389]  inauguration we wanted to make sure to basically scare them off and intimidate them and then the
[01:22:54.389 --> 01:22:59.430]  people at the doj got on his case and they said oh uh yeah you weren't supposed to say that actually
[01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:03.990]  there might be some trouble because of this now we never heard anything more about that but
[01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:07.670]  you know i look at a lot of these different defendants that have been involved in this
[01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:11.830]  there was a case that was dropped just this past week where the fbi went and they went to this
[01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:16.630]  guy's facebook records and and he was saying oh i was in the capital it turned out that he wasn't
[01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:21.350]  they dropped his charges so all these people got to start to counter sue against the government
[01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:26.070]  and i think that'll open up new information i think that'll open up a new front on on legal
[01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:32.150]  warfare and then ultimately you know it might be prudent to push for some kind of a january sixth
[01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:36.550]  commission for our own interest to get to the bottom of this to ask the questions not about
[01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:42.389]  like who should we put in jail not not how should we sentence and gulag everybody that was involved
[01:23:42.389 --> 01:23:47.430]  but like you said answer the critical questions like who gave the stand-down order what exactly
[01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:52.070]  was going on how exactly was this thing organized because and to get to that second point that you
[01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:59.270]  made about donald trump i remember exactly what you're talking about now i had almost no involvement
[01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:02.950]  in the planning of this thing i know you were a little more involved i know ali was involved
[01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:07.670]  but all i was told is there's going to be a rally on the sixth outside the white house be there at
[01:24:07.670 --> 01:24:12.630]  like 9 a.m or something and that that's all i knew about it i had no plans for the sixth other than
[01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:17.510]  this until i plan on going to the rally and going straight home and i remember distinctly during the
[01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:22.710]  president's speech which i wasn't expecting i had heard nothing about this during the president's
[01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:28.950]  speech on the ellipse he specifically said that he would lead the march to the capital and and
[01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:33.830]  exactly like you said i don't know what happened to that but he said i think two times in the speech
[01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:39.030]  that he would be out in front of that he would meet the people that were at the ellipse at the
[01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:44.710]  washington monument at the capital he said that he would lead the protesters over there and you
[01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:49.990]  know i i know everybody else went there i know you went there i went down there i saw possibly
[01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:55.030]  hundreds of thousands of people walking from the white house all the way to the capital president
[01:24:55.030 --> 01:25:00.469]  trump never arrived where did he go what exactly was the plan there so there's a lot of unanswered
[01:25:00.469 --> 01:25:04.710]  questions about exactly what i said you'll have before but you're right i want to know what
[01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:08.790]  happened i because i'm being blamed you're being blamed we were walked right into this i don't
[01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:13.750]  think trump did this you know this obviously hurt him but he has the answers he and he alone
[01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:19.190]  other than the bad guys that can bring them down i think he should be exactly wanting a commission
[01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:26.630]  or having his own well and i i think a big part of why they censored him was because of exactly
[01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:32.150]  this i mean they and and they also it was very strategic of them they impeached him on the same
[01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:37.590]  day they brought everybody back in session and they impeached donald trump after the riot and
[01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:43.750]  you know why they convicted him before the the body was even cold of ashley babbit exactly
[01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:49.910]  right right and and they did that so that that was hanging over his head throughout the remainder of
[01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:54.950]  his presidency because he was still president from the sixth until the 20th and then even on after
[01:25:54.950 --> 01:26:00.790]  that well into february that's when they finally resolved the impeachment and so i think the 25th
[01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:06.230]  amendment the whole time right right and well they've been doing that since he got into office
[01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:11.830]  but right then republicans at that point mike pence cabinet officials could have conceivably
[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:16.230]  been a part of a coup like that using the 25th amendment they had that hanging over his head that
[01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:20.630]  it's like look if you don't play ball we will impeach you convict you and put you in jail
[01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:25.590]  if you don't play ball mike pence and the cabinet will revolt and get you out of office and throw
[01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:29.830]  you in jail and so i think that that was a big strategic thing that they did because at that
[01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:33.990]  point trump had nothing left to lose he was stabbed in the back by everybody but they put
[01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:38.870]  that dagger over his head so that he couldn't have a full range of motion and then since the
[01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:44.150]  impeachment has obviously resolved itself back in february where would he possibly be able to
[01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:49.430]  air this out he's banned from facebook twitter youtube everything else uh you know so they
[01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:53.190]  really put everybody in a bad situation in part he needs to bring the rallies back
[01:26:54.469 --> 01:26:59.830]  i absolutely agree and he's not been outspoken enough about this i love donald trump i was there
[01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:04.469]  on the 6-4 donald trump and i regret nothing you know because this guy was the real deal real
[01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:10.630]  patriot that being said what has he used his platform for since leaving office he goes on
[01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:15.670]  sean hannity and he just kind of like complains about lebron james saying that thing about that
[01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:20.550]  police officer a month ago and he puts out these press releases from the desk of donald trump it's
[01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:26.550]  like you have 475 year supporters languishing under under the grip of the federal government
[01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:32.309]  for going out to support you like you said he knows what happened on that day so why doesn't he
[01:27:32.309 --> 01:27:38.309]  use the pulpit that he still has go out there do a rally and tell the truth and and mobilize the
[01:27:38.309 --> 01:27:42.870]  people again i i don't know what's going on it seems like the donald trump that we have now is
[01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:49.190]  not the same donald trump that we had back in 2016 because this donald trump is far more conventional
[01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:53.990]  plays by the conventional playbook and you know obviously the conventional playbook is not going
[01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:59.590]  to win against conventional adversaries he doesn't have general flan he doesn't they have harassed
[01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:03.830]  and cut off everybody and they harass anyone around him i mean they harass the people the
[01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:08.309]  lady that serves ice cream in his club the people that cook his steaks i mean they i'm not a victim
[01:28:08.309 --> 01:28:13.670]  here it's just they have harassed my family they've hired pis we're talking you know wall
[01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:21.030]  street journal new york times washington post vanity fair people they've moved reporters to
[01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:26.230]  austin that did year-long investigations apiece offering people money to lie about me when i have
[01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:30.150]  such a boring life you know i mean about as excited as it gets as me eating a big steak and
[01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:35.350]  a potato like a pig at seven at night then watching tv i mean you know i'm getting the hot tub but i
[01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:40.710]  mean they have been and i've talked to people around trump they have harassed the hell out
[01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:44.870]  of everyone around him so if you because let me tell you i don't they've tried to target my crew
[01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:49.350]  too over the years they just ran off the bad people this crew is incredible but if i didn't
[01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:55.670]  have a crew i could do nothing and trump does not have a crew that's his problem i mean he couldn't
[01:28:55.670 --> 01:29:04.469]  i'm told he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the 1995 level technology one person posting
[01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:09.110]  board where he would post something with no interaction and then you wonder why he canceled
[01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:15.830]  it he could he could go to uh gab right now they have a two million people for him just on his own
[01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:23.510]  page and it works good but again he won't do it because he is surrounded by scum yeah well and
[01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:28.870]  that's a story often told about the past four years during the trump administration as i think
[01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:35.110]  that donald trump you know when it was let trump be trump back in 2016 that is what started the
[01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:39.670]  whole revolution that's what made him the the primary nominee that's what made him the president
[01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:45.750]  of the united states in 16 and you know something kind of peculiar happened in november 16 is that
[01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:50.710]  brian's previous took over the transition and then they got johnny de steffano and ppo and then
[01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:56.150]  jerry kushner starts to get involved and like you said all of a sudden donald trump finds himself
[01:29:56.150 --> 01:30:00.550]  surrounded by people that are that are a bad influence either people that are malicious
[01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:04.389]  people that are incompetent but this has been the story of the administration and i know you know
[01:30:04.389 --> 01:30:08.790]  and i know and anybody that knows anything about what went on in washington dc for the past four
[01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:14.950]  years that was like the story the administration is trump is doing what he can but he's one guy
[01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:19.190]  he's literally one guy i'm gonna explain this i'm 47 you're young and that's great we're counting
[01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:24.790]  people like you i've been doing this 27 years and i get to a point sometimes where my brain refuses
[01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:29.190]  to look at something anymore because it hates it so i hate the globalists i wanted to feed them
[01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:33.830]  but my brain at a certain point goes i refuse to look at this anymore you're gonna go have
[01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:39.270]  some fun which is a normal way i don't have a heart attack imagine me in 74 like trump
[01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:44.230]  and when he got it in at first he had a few good a lot of bad people but he could had his will
[01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:50.469]  he bulldozed a lot of it through got set up got attacked got surveilled and now because he doesn't
[01:30:50.469 --> 01:30:54.469]  have all that power anymore all those power brokers that at least did some of what he wanted
[01:30:54.469 --> 01:30:59.350]  they're gone because he doesn't have power to offer him anymore so he's literally like a dude
[01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:05.590]  that wants to hoe up a thousand acres but doesn't have a tractor or a mule so imagine trump doesn't
[01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:10.630]  even have a hatchet or a hoe and i'm not and i'm not defending him i'm just saying we everyone that
[01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:16.469]  keeps imbuing him with all this power he had the power we gave him and and we got a lot done
[01:31:16.469 --> 01:31:22.389]  i'm surprised it ever happened we sucker punched the globalists but now they're on board to destroy
[01:31:22.389 --> 01:31:28.469]  us they are no they know we kicked their ass so we've now summoned their counter strike their
[01:31:28.469 --> 01:31:33.590]  empire strikes back and so the big question is what do we the people do instead of counting on a
[01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:39.190]  magic cue or a magic trump we're gonna have to pull ourselves up with our bootstraps i've done it
[01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:44.230]  you've done it others have done it and i'm not bragging it's true we're the model of perseverance
[01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:49.830]  and victory so how do we have victory nick fuentes well in my opinion we have to follow through on
[01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:55.110]  the message of stop the steal you know in my opinion the the battle is not over from stop
[01:31:55.110 --> 01:32:00.070]  the steal and not necessarily it's hr1 damn right if they get that it's a it's a dictatorship
[01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:06.550]  explain it well not necessarily just that but i'm talking particularly about destroying the gop
[01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:11.830]  following through on the promise during stop the steal to say we cannot allow the gop to go back
[01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:18.710]  to the way that it was i think when you say take complete the takeover of the gop exactly exactly
[01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:24.469]  institutionalizing the trump revolution that he started in 2016 when you say destroy the gop
[01:32:24.469 --> 01:32:28.710]  that goes great with the base and i get what you mean you mean you mean conquer it take it over
[01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:35.590]  for the people capture the flag you need to destroy destroy the insiders destroy the uh
[01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:43.190]  shycom agents what you'd call the israel firsters anybody that isn't for america yes exactly the the
[01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:48.630]  gop regime you know it's it's the gop and this has been the story for 30 years probably a lot
[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:53.430]  longer than that that you've got the constituency of the gop which is right on the money you know
[01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:57.750]  the american people know what's going on it's been the leadership of the gop and the conservative
[01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:01.430]  movement that has steered them wrong and misguided them and betrayed them well yeah that's global
[01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:06.630]  opposition so yeah so so i'm not disagreeing with you but why do you use the word destroy the gop
[01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:12.870]  instead how about remove the fake gop well destroy the gop is just a little bit more catchy but i
[01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:17.270]  agree with what you're saying and just to make myself clear right the gop should be used as a
[01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:22.710]  vehicle to get america first into power right wipe out the regime wipe out the people that are in
[01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:28.070]  control use the gop to enhance our message because donald trump ran as a republican i'm not in favor
[01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:34.150]  of totally you know making that's what they fear is us taking it over right destroy the corrupt
[01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:41.430]  leadership of the gdp of the gop i totally agree destroy the fake loyal opposition new order scum
[01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:48.150]  destroy them that's right that's right and replace them with the true america first people like
[01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:52.630]  donald trump like ronda santas like a lot of these people that you see stepping up and taking
[01:33:52.630 --> 01:33:57.350]  leadership uh because what they're trying to do is take the republican party and drag it back to
[01:33:57.350 --> 01:34:01.430]  what it was before and and you know a lot of people say well the republican party is corrupt
[01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:06.230]  and the republican party is far gone but donald trump came in there beat everybody won the
[01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:11.590]  presidency and was able to build 500 miles a while not start a single new war he was able
[01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:16.710]  to read renegotiate the trade deals fight a trade war with china we can use the gop towards the ends
[01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:21.350]  of america first the thing that is standing in the way is like you said that's the loyal
[01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:24.790]  opposition it is the people that have ran this country and the party into the ground
[01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:29.830]  doing the dirty work of the left oftentimes sometimes more eagerly than the left themselves
[01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:35.030]  so that's the path forward in my mind is we have got to stop voting for rhinos we've got to stop
[01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:39.830]  voting for and being complicit in and supporting people that are wrecking the party and as you say
[01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:45.110]  american first is inevitable that's right it is it is inevitably going to happen and it's
[01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:49.910]  inevitable because you know the country's going down and everybody can see that and there's going
[01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:54.550]  to come a time when enough people are going to wake up because the country is going down
[01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:58.710]  that we're going to be able to turn things around and i think that's basically what happened under
[01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:02.710]  donald trump oh i mean i agree i was about to say it's already happened they stole the election
[01:35:02.710 --> 01:35:07.270]  so when i said everything obviously getting rid of the rhinos is key but i mean everything is
[01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:11.990]  election wise if we don't stop the election fraud we don't have a hope if we do defeat it
[01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:17.670]  we're going to have major victory that's true that's true because trump won in 2020 keep in
[01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:23.350]  mind everything going against donald trump the coronavirus the recession the russia hoax the
[01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:29.030]  media being against him and he won 74 million votes more than any other sitting president in
[01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:33.750]  the history of the united states and he won the election it was because of unprecedented mail-in
[01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.950]  ballot fraud the likes of which has never been seen maybe in the history of the world so we
[01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:41.510]  shouldn't get depressed because the truth is we've been kicking the globalist asses that's why
[01:35:42.309 --> 01:35:45.190]  did we not think they wouldn't counter-strike with all their stolen money
[01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:50.790]  right it's empire strikes back that was the perfect analogy because when we put trump in
[01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:55.430]  office and and it was the base of people that that allowed donald trump to mount this challenge
[01:35:55.430 --> 01:36:00.870]  against the globalists we did sucker punch them we did knock them back on their butt and and now
[01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:05.430]  what we've seen is the largest counter-attack in history which has been by the way four years in
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:10.150]  the making they said the day after trump got elected at google headquarters we have to make
[01:36:10.150 --> 01:36:14.950]  sure that this never happens again and it was the most powerful institutions in the world that have
[01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:21.190]  worked every day since then to engineer the big tech censorship regime engineer potentially the
[01:36:21.190 --> 01:36:26.710]  covid virus and the lockdown and recession engineer the voter fraud and the elites keep going but the
[01:36:26.710 --> 01:36:31.190]  elites are so weak though in the old days they just kill a president they know there's good guys
[01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:36.070]  throughout the system so they're not even willing to kill people anymore which again shows their
[01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:40.630]  little globalist system only makes everybody weak i mean and i'm not saying killing presidents is
[01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:45.270]  good i'm just saying they don't even have the power to actually kill a president and and try to
[01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:49.270]  get away with it because they have no honor to kill a president you can say what you want about
[01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:54.790]  kennedy those guys had enough honor they could keep it quiet they don't even trust themselves
[01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:59.110]  enough to kill a president right now think about that because they're such backstabbers they're
[01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:04.710]  fools they have no honor which makes them thieves they're stupid they lose their real power and that
[01:37:04.710 --> 01:37:10.150]  they have no honor because they're all screwing each other over that's right and the system is
[01:37:10.150 --> 01:37:15.350]  fragile you know that's what that the things that they're doing right now this is not the actions of
[01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:20.870]  a system which is confident in itself a system that is strong and powerful they are lashing out
[01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:24.790]  desperately and that's how we have to look at it when they're when they're pushing the envelope on
[01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:29.590]  all this stuff with the feds and the doj and all of that that is desperation because they saw what
[01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:35.030]  happened on january 6th and i think it was almost fitting in a way because i'm not talking about the
[01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:40.230]  the breach i'm not talking about the broken glass and things like that but i maybe you felt the same
[01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:43.990]  way i don't want to put words in your mouth but i know that when i pulled up to the capitol on
[01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:49.110]  january 6th and i saw the building surrounded by hundreds of thousands of trump supporters wearing
[01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:54.150]  their maga hats waving american flags oh i love that feeling of showing our power and showing that
[01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:59.350]  biden can't get 50 people at an event but we've got a million and then that's why i got so mad
[01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:04.710]  when it was all taken from us by a few idiots right because it was a glorious sight i mean that
[01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:10.150]  was a beautiful image and it was a demonstration of power for once and in a way it was almost a
[01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:15.270]  fitting end except for the trap except for the the screw job that they pulled what what a
[01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:22.710]  demonstration it was like trump came to dc in january 2017 and in 2021 hundreds of thousands
[01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:27.990]  of of his supporters came and surrounded the capitol to say you know we want the trump
[01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:34.070]  revolution it's the next chapter of the war exactly we can't expect magic intel q says is
[01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:38.790]  going to save us i trump won in a landslide we know that the evidence is overwhelming and all
[01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:42.630]  those battleground states instead of winning by a quarter point or tenth of a point one by a point
[01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:49.510]  three points five points but if you pull back i mean that is just a devastating victory against
[01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:54.870]  them but as i said we cannot then expect that they're not going to counter strike uh nick
[01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:59.910]  always incredible points again tell people how do they find your amazing weeknight show
[01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:04.790]  i am on america first out live monday through friday at 8 p.m central time
[01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:10.070]  lastly one last point i like robert barnes i know you like him he's a really smart guy and
[01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:14.710]  you can see from his perspective i don't like radical islam i don't like what the palestinians
[01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:21.750]  are doing i'm not against israel i get his points i think the last straw was something you've talked
[01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:29.110]  about is we're sick of the israel lobby being used to paint american patriots and conservatives
[01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:34.309]  and christians as anti-semitic and so i think israel and people that support israel need to know
[01:39:34.309 --> 01:39:41.910]  if israel wants to be some pro-freedom bastion and pro-free speech and pro-gun then we will
[01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:47.430]  support it i think but if it becomes some thing that's like this idol we have to worship and
[01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:52.469]  it's great and it gets his freedoms but we don't and then and then israel and and and
[01:39:52.469 --> 01:39:59.190]  jews in general allow uh the adl and others to be this bucket of black paint that they paint us with
[01:39:59.190 --> 01:40:03.590]  people are going to resent that i think that's why you've seen in conservatives and nationalists a
[01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:09.510]  major turn against israel and i'm not against the average jew i'm not against israel i know if you
[01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:12.870]  turned it over to the muslims they'd be killing each other over it but at the same time it's not
[01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:20.469]  some fetish thing that i'm supposed to worship while the jerusalem post says i'm an anti-semite
[01:40:20.469 --> 01:40:27.190]  because i'm pro-gun i mean i just can't take it anymore having sasha barry cohen that makes his
[01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:33.670]  living off of super racist stuff going and setting up rednecks to sing an anti-semitic song so he
[01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:38.150]  can say we're bad people when he's the son of a bitch making hundreds of millions of dollars off
[01:40:38.150 --> 01:40:43.350]  of it and i don't like being led around and made fun of by him that i'm a dumb hillbilly christian
[01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:48.870]  with buck teeth and all these caricatures that hitler did against jews i'm sick of bill maher
[01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:53.510]  doing them against against midwestern white people you know i'm not a racist i'm a christian
[01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:57.830]  i'm a good person and i'm not going to sit there and watch a bunch of leftists i don't care whether
[01:40:57.830 --> 01:41:01.830]  they're black or jewish or whoever the hell they are tell me i'm a piece of crap all day
[01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:08.710]  that's so well said and that sums up why you're seeing people turn on this issue because you know
[01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:12.630]  when people are being led to believe that israel was like this right-wing state that was joining
[01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:17.590]  us in the fight against radical islam people go you know okay that's reasonable america has allies
[01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:21.510]  america can support our allies and you know hey maybe these jewish people have something in common
[01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:25.990]  with us but you're right it's turned now into like this this big blackmail scheme and it's like
[01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:32.070]  look i got into this in 2016 with the message of america first i mean yeah okay we can have allies
[01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:37.030]  and yeah if israel can can justify itself based on its merits like you said if they're if they're
[01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:41.990]  pro-gun if they're pro-nationalism and so on that's terrific but you've got people that are
[01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:47.670]  coming in and they're telling christian conservative american patriots that if you don't put israel
[01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:52.549]  before america if you're not in favor of foreign aid and foreign wars and all of this well you just
[01:41:52.549 --> 01:41:57.670]  hate jews or you you just must hate israel you're an anti-semi and that's exactly right i'm sick of
[01:41:57.670 --> 01:42:02.870]  people demanding in the america first movement that we have allegiance or patriotism to a foreign
[01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:08.150]  country and by the way nobody would accept the current situation with israel if it was any other
[01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:12.790]  country if it was a russian group saying this about russia if it was chinese group saying that
[01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:19.350]  about china or mexico saying about mexico no conservative would for one second stomach
[01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:23.590]  the kind of behavior of the israel lobby if it came from any other country and i think we know
[01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:29.510]  why that is it's because the israel lobby is more influential than let me expand on that i liked uh
[01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:35.590]  the big uh vegas magnet giving trump a bunch of money i'm all like hey if the israel lobby wants
[01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:41.270]  to promote guns and sovereignty and low taxes whoo israel and so i think there's a battle also over
[01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:45.990]  the heart and soul of what jews in america and israel are going to push i know a lot of jews
[01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:50.389]  that actually love trump love guns love america they agree with you nick and so the question is
[01:42:50.389 --> 01:42:55.670]  i think instead of just getting in a fight with israel in general we can very easily only use the
[01:42:55.670 --> 01:43:01.590]  word seduce it's a bad word but i think we can actually get most jews on board to actually
[01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:07.670]  promote america and promote freedom instead of letting the left dictated and control jews by
[01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:12.389]  saying anybody that's for freedom is anti-semitic that's trying to inject something into a debate
[01:43:12.389 --> 01:43:17.750]  that shouldn't even be there so i all i'm saying is i want to have a dialogue and the adl and
[01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:22.549]  southern poverty law center do not want any dialogue because they want to control the jews
[01:43:22.549 --> 01:43:28.790]  in israel just like they want to control everybody else but jews are huge political givers per capita
[01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:33.430]  for a religious group they're the number one givers in the world and a lot of this is people
[01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:38.230]  trying to scare jews to keep them on the jewish plantation i think everybody needs off the
[01:43:38.230 --> 01:43:42.630]  plantation and i think whether you're a whether you are a christian or a muslim or a jew or an
[01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:47.670]  agnostic you have a right to say what you want when you want and big tech on the censorship
[01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:53.030]  using the anti-semitic slur is what's hurting jews and israel more than anything and i'm
[01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:58.870]  telling jews in a loving way if you're jewish you particularly need to speak up and say no to this
[01:43:59.830 --> 01:44:04.150]  well and and everyone can be america first and i think you hit the nail on the head right there
[01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:08.230]  and it's true everybody has it's not a white supremacist thing it's not a white nationalist
[01:44:08.230 --> 01:44:13.190]  thing every american has a vested interest in putting this country first because insofar as
[01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:17.030]  you're american and you reside in this country why would you want to put something ahead of america
[01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:21.190]  or the well-being of america that's called being a slave exactly if we don't put ourselves first
[01:44:21.190 --> 01:44:25.430]  we won't have the wealth and support and success to help others putting yourself first is not
[01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:31.750]  selfish if you don't put yourself first you're in a cult that's right that's right and and you
[01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:35.750]  can't call yourself a patriot if you're not in favor of putting america first and and you're
[01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:39.350]  right jewish people i think even people that support israel can be a part of that too you
[01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:43.510]  know laura loomer i had her on my show good morning groper and she said you know look you
[01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:47.670]  and i disagree about the israel lobby but we basically agree on everything else we agree on
[01:44:47.670 --> 01:44:53.030]  big tech immigration the anti-white hatred from the media all of this why can we not work together
[01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.389]  and she said you know look i'll tell you i'm america first not israel first i said you know
[01:44:56.389 --> 01:45:01.190]  what then we're allies right if we agree on 90 percent and you say you're america first i say
[01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:05.350]  that's that's an alliance right there so it's just about being imaginative about what this
[01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:10.710]  relationship can be and and the core guiding principle is just about reciprocity it has to
[01:45:10.710 --> 01:45:15.910]  be on our terms we can't we can't have our terms dictated down to us by a foreign country and told
[01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:19.670]  this is how it has to be if there's some reciprocity and and they you know they could
[01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:23.590]  put america first then i think we're on the same page and there's no problem and i said in the
[01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:29.670]  debate i'm not necessarily anti-israel per se i'm against these kinds of relationships when they're
[01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:34.469]  abusive with any country there is a similarly abusive relationship with nato and the united
[01:45:34.469 --> 01:45:39.510]  states oh i don't like nato saying china's good i'm i agree with trump we should run nato not
[01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:44.950]  the chi comms and that's how it works if we don't run the un the chinese do if we don't run nato
[01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:49.110]  somebody else and look i'm not for an empire i went out of all this but if we're gonna have
[01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:54.549]  this stuff we better run it well and it has to be on our terms it has to be for our interest
[01:45:54.549 --> 01:45:58.150]  and in the same way that we could say to nato hey you know you're not spending enough money
[01:45:58.150 --> 01:46:01.750]  you need to pay a certain percentage of your gdp and hold up your end of the bargain
[01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:06.469]  you know it's not to say that there's you know like you said we have this system it is the way
[01:46:06.469 --> 01:46:11.350]  that it is let's have it on on our terms let's dictate it in a way that is reciprocal in a way
[01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:17.510]  that benefits us and that same reasoning must apply in all cases with no special exceptions
[01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:21.990]  with no exception for a well-funded lobby or anything like that and and i think that that
[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:27.030]  is something that is is pretty uncontroversial and basically universal i think that anybody who is
[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:32.150]  really a serious patriot can say i can put america first in each and every single case
[01:46:32.150 --> 01:46:36.790]  that doesn't make me a racist that doesn't make me an anti-semite it doesn't make me a bigot
[01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:41.750]  that that is the core of what it means to be a patriot what it means to be an american closing
[01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:46.549]  and closing let's just go one one further if something's better if the new country forms
[01:46:46.549 --> 01:46:51.030]  it's even better and shows a track record i would support that as well but the globalists want to
[01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:54.630]  get rid of the american system because it challenges their centralized system do we have
[01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:59.830]  problems are we corrupt damn right wealth and power that comes from freedom creates that paradox but
[01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:04.710]  what they're trying to get rid of america's ideas for is to replace it with this leftist corporate
[01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:12.710]  selfish fraud that diminishes the individual and that is trying to take us over and so i grew up
[01:47:12.710 --> 01:47:16.710]  here in how great america was and how great texas was and i was never an arrogant person
[01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:20.070]  so i thought why are my grandparents and parents that are such humble people
[01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:24.230]  crazy when it comes to america and texas well it's because of our family and what we've done
[01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.830]  and all of it and also they've been around the world they realized it was under attack so as
[01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:33.910]  long as i'm a turd that i realized this country is literally our ship and it's sinking now we
[01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:38.469]  better love it or we're gonna lose it nick pointez thank you so much great interview and we really
[01:47:38.469 --> 01:47:43.990]  appreciate you coming on thanks for having me i appreciate it and i like nick pointez i like
[01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:49.990]  robert barnes i want to get them i'm going to ask them both here would you accept a another debate
[01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:54.389]  maybe moderated by who barnes wants because i said i wouldn't talk and i probably talked too much
[01:47:54.389 --> 01:47:59.750]  nick would you have another debate with robert barnes i would i would anytime any moderator he
[01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:05.590]  can call the details i'm game all right thank you and again because it became a fight with the
[01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:09.510]  grippers you know you know kind of going after barnes which is fun it's all it's all fair and
[01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:14.070]  loving war i like being attacked i think it's interesting it's fun people help me get better
[01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:20.469]  uh barnes um it's probably going on the show next week on some other issues but i would really love
[01:48:20.469 --> 01:48:24.790]  because i think they both made some really good points uh because you know i like israel a lot of
[01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:30.389]  ways uh other ways i'm being called anti-semitic for no reason it's kind of like my god i like
[01:48:30.389 --> 01:48:35.350]  want to support you and you're slapping me upside the head but that's not israel that's the leftist
[01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:40.630]  and that's what they're up to so uh but i should be able to tell israel and what what what i as
[01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:45.430]  american think and what i think should be going on because i'm equal i'm just as important as
[01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:49.750]  israel ish i mean you say oh well that's a country how do you say you're as important as it is i'm
[01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:56.469]  an american i am america you understand i'm good i'm strong i fought horn my family's good and and
[01:48:56.469 --> 01:49:02.150]  i i have a future and and and i have an identity and i get together with other people that share
[01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:07.510]  that idea and we build a world islam has its plan for the world i don't want to be part of that
[01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:12.070]  they can go do what they want all day i don't want to kill them i don't hate them but if they
[01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:15.670]  think they're going to come tell me how to live they got a problem and it's the same thing for
[01:49:15.670 --> 01:49:21.750]  the russians or the chinese or israel or anybody else if the russians were in my business the way
[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:28.150]  the israel lobby is i would be hopping mad and that's where i'm going but i'm not stupid if they
[01:49:28.150 --> 01:49:31.670]  had some new communist leader in russia i'm not going to be the enemy of the russians
[01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:38.150]  that is key to understand and that's why all day they tell you jones isn't really an american
[01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:43.030]  trump's not really an american oh they're really on foreign payroll because they know i am an
[01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:50.309]  american if i'm anything i am an american and and and i am proud of america and i'm proud of my
[01:49:51.110 --> 01:49:56.230]  heritage and i and i'm proud of my european roots but i'm proud of everybody else and their roots as
[01:49:56.230 --> 01:50:03.190]  well but i will not sit here and hear that i'm bad because of who i am no i am who my ancestors
[01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:08.549]  are and i and i respect that and i'm proud of that and i'm also know you're human as well and
[01:50:08.549 --> 01:50:13.830]  i'm proud of you all right we're going to go to this special report then we're going to come back
[01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:18.710]  with the nightmare analysis on the covet bio weapon globalist takeover that is so incredibly
[01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:24.070]  important and we will finish up with that and then lord willing i'll be live tomorrow 4 to 6
[01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:30.309]  pm central with my sunday show and then i went shroyer with sunday live 6 to 8 pm here is the
[01:50:30.309 --> 01:50:37.190]  save the frogs save humanity report uh and it's important and i hope that you that already know
[01:50:37.190 --> 01:50:41.110]  all this that are watching will go to band out video where it's posted on the front page and
[01:50:41.110 --> 01:50:46.070]  we'll share it and instead of it getting uh you know 300 000 views or whatever it's going to get
[01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:51.830]  it'll get 10 million views because this is one of the big central issues not just the poison vaccines
[01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:56.389]  that aren't vaccines it's it's the endocrine disruptors uh and it's something they've really
[01:50:56.389 --> 01:51:00.469]  tried to suppress because they're scared of it just like they don't want a real commission on
[01:51:00.469 --> 01:51:05.510]  january 6 uh they don't want a real investigation of the chemicals because they admit it's their
[01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:12.389]  plan so here's the report we'll be right back the biggest online meme in history is widely recognized
[01:51:12.549 --> 01:51:16.469]  the alex jones gay frogs rant do you understand that
[01:51:20.150 --> 01:51:25.350]  corporate media has attacked me thousands of times for it literally there have been
[01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:30.950]  dozens of times that late night comics have made it their central joke i don't like them
[01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:36.469]  putting chemicals in the water that turned the friggin frogs gay do you understand that
[01:51:36.469 --> 01:51:45.110]  wow if he is that upset about a government conspiracy that is not happening just imagine
[01:51:45.110 --> 01:51:49.110]  how upset he's going to be when he finds out about one that actually is like this explanation
[01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:53.510]  as to why men are gay the reason there's so many gay people now is because it's a chemical warfare
[01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:59.030]  operation here's the inside of this juice box and if they zoom in anymore see that thin plastic
[01:51:59.030 --> 01:52:03.750]  it's got it after you're done drinking your little juices well you i mean you're you're
[01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:09.030]  ready to go out and have a baby he's saying the chemicals are making people gay folks it's making
[01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:16.389]  the frogs gay two-thirds of the frogs down in houston are bisexual great show alex we sold a
[01:52:16.389 --> 01:52:26.790]  lot of super male vitality formula soon all of your listeners will be transformed into gay
[01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:27.830]  alumni
[01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:39.030]  fun side note pinterest also took down their info wars page which is bad news if you were
[01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:45.990]  planning an autumn wedding with the theme gay frog chemtrails tap water is a gay bomb and that they
[01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:51.350]  are putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay matte brain fighters is how the
[01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:58.150]  lesbian conspiracy has maintained its vice grip on our nation's chia seed supply all right it's
[01:52:58.150 --> 01:53:04.150]  how they reproduce alex jones is a fake which by the way people have a right to be remember that
[01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:09.030]  gay frog clip at the start he did a follow-up show explaining how chemicals were being placed in the
[01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:16.389]  water to feminize society and reduce the population and then immediately segued to this we sell five
[01:53:16.389 --> 01:53:21.110]  different brands of the very best watery water filtration systems out there they're amazing they
[01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:28.070]  cut out 99.99 of the glyphosate the herbicides the pesticides the fluoride i mean to an untrained
[01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:33.830]  eye it sure seems like he was using the idea of a gay frog to sell his products which incidentally
[01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:39.190]  is the same mistake the wb network made on info wars one of his most famous statements was saying
[01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:44.790]  that tap water is turning the frogs gay and it'll turn you gay too first off gay people are awesome
[01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:49.430]  i don't think that's a problem at all that's the problem with a guy like alex jones because
[01:53:50.230 --> 01:53:57.670]  he got them to believe that the gay frogs were based on studies and facts but it's not a laughing
[01:53:57.670 --> 01:54:06.950]  matter endocrine disruptors phthalates and other chemicals in the water supply are gender bending
[01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:16.549]  not just frogs not just birds not just monkeys but humans every species on earth is becoming
[01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:23.670]  sterile and is also confusing its sexual preference we know from studies over a decade ago that
[01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:30.710]  mercury makes birds gay and people go yay gay is cool except now there won't be any more of those
[01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:36.630]  birds they're going extinct many species of frog and toad are close to going extinct because the
[01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:42.710]  majority of the males when they come in contact with atrazine and other chemicals are becoming
[01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:48.710]  attracted to other males and trying to fertilize other male's eggs that don't exist then when you
[01:54:48.710 --> 01:54:55.270]  pull back and you study books like eco science written by obama's science czar he admits to
[01:54:55.270 --> 01:55:00.870]  plans to put gender bending chemicals in the water so this isn't just an accident this isn't just
[01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:07.590]  runoff that is taking place this is being done by design as a program of depopulation they have
[01:55:07.590 --> 01:55:16.150]  picked formulas for fuel and formulas for other products like plastics that create the leakage
[01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:21.590]  and the leaching of these chemicals into the environment when i've talked to top chemists
[01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:28.070]  top developers and they say it's very easy and inexpensive to have safer fuels safer plastics
[01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:33.910]  and other products the system made a decision back in the 50s and then the 60s when microwaves
[01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:41.990]  came out to by design allow lining in the plastic containers where the food would then be cooked
[01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:48.630]  to leach massive amounts of phthalates and other chemicals that again on record in utero
[01:55:48.630 --> 01:55:57.270]  if a woman is eating food that was cooked heated on those plastics not just in microwaves but also
[01:55:57.270 --> 01:56:01.990]  in conventional ovens that it would then leach those chemicals and in utero
[01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:08.469]  in the first trimester lower the level of testosterone penis size number of sperm you name
[01:56:08.469 --> 01:56:16.150]  it that her child when he grows up will be able to produce this has all been done by design don't
[01:56:17.110 --> 01:56:24.710]  microwave their food in plastic containers and the reason for this is pretty simple the
[01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:29.110]  american academy of pediatrics warns families to avoid this practice because when plastic
[01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:35.590]  containers are heated up they can release harmful chemicals into that food and kids are the biggest
[01:56:35.590 --> 01:56:41.430]  concern of course why well these leached chemicals may interfere with the child's hormones override
[01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:46.870]  big tech sensors click the link below and share this important report and you can go out and look
[01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:55.030]  at thousands of examples in the environment where major government agencies and universities
[01:56:55.030 --> 01:57:00.870]  are actually sterilizing different insects and different fish to lower their populations
[01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:08.469]  or in the case of japan they feed a derivative of the soybean to catfish so that they're all
[01:57:08.469 --> 01:57:15.030]  female because the females of that species are much larger we have a ranch in east texas and we
[01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:21.910]  have a large 10-acre pond that has plants that grow in it and make it hard to be able to swim
[01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:29.750]  in or fish and so we went to the state of texas who gave us sterilized carp that we then put in
[01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:34.309]  the lake that can't reproduce because they're an invasive species how do they sterilize them
[01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:41.350]  when they were eggs they just put a few drops of an industrial chemical into the water and again
[01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:47.670]  that makes them all sterile that's just one example my father owns property with sterilized
[01:57:47.670 --> 01:57:54.230]  fish on it with just a few drops put into the water when they were developing as eggs as embryos
[01:57:55.190 --> 01:57:59.270]  this is everything ladies and gentlemen this is how the globalists have emasculated us
[01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:05.110]  our sperm counts are down more than 50 in every industrialized country and as soon as other
[01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:09.990]  countries that weren't industrialized like brazil adopt the same chemicals the same policies that
[01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:17.750]  are used in the europe in japan in the us in canada in australia we're seeing similar numbers
[01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:24.549]  and not just sterilization not just feminization but we're also seeing skyrocketing cancer cases
[01:58:24.549 --> 01:58:29.590]  we're seeing hyper feminized women girls that go into puberty now on average at eight instead of
[01:58:29.590 --> 01:58:35.990]  12 now we see three-year-old girls that are going into menstrual cycles even some babies are now
[01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:41.270]  having menstrual cycles so this is very very dangerous it feminizes men and it over develops
[01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:47.590]  women and actually shortens the length of their lives as well the globalists are hitting us with
[01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:54.230]  soft kill chemical weapons and they admit that this is part of their larger plan that's why
[01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:59.990]  we're making it a major part of our initiative at info wars to expose this because this is a topic
[01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:05.670]  that when we cover it the system tries to make into a joke we've come out with a new t-shirt
[01:59:05.670 --> 01:59:10.790]  that helps you fund the info war but also helps you in a non-threatening way spread the word it
[01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:17.430]  simply says on the front info wars.com save the frogs on the back it's much bigger and then people
[01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:21.590]  are guaranteed because i've worn these out in public now before they went on sale i'm going to
[01:59:21.590 --> 01:59:25.750]  ask you questions about it and are going to want to know more and then you can direct them to the
[01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:30.790]  research and information and understand that we're not just saving the frogs here we're saving
[01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:35.750]  ourselves and this is a topic that almost everybody's heard of the quote frogs being gay
[01:59:44.549 --> 01:59:48.870]  really what they are is confused and being sterilized and what you see with frogs is
[01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:53.590]  happening with humans now where genital sizes are going down black white hispanic doesn't matter
[01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:58.469]  fertility is going down and it's being done through the chemicals to make us a more manageable
[01:59:58.469 --> 02:00:06.309]  docile dumbed down group so go to info war store.com today and get this shirt in three
[02:00:06.309 --> 02:00:12.950]  different great colors one is a light cream one is black and one is kind of a jungle electric green
[02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:17.590]  i would call it they're great shirts these came in about a month ago before they went on sale
[02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:22.630]  everybody around the office wants one people been loving them people been getting great responses
[02:00:22.630 --> 02:00:28.309]  out and around austin texas wearing them and you will too some of the info war shirts are very very
[02:00:28.309 --> 02:00:32.870]  aggressive like the first one i designed 25 years ago mass murderers agree gun control works with
[02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:38.870]  hitler stalin and maul and on the back it says politicians love disarmed peasants that's a great
[02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:45.590]  shirt but it's very hardcore on a scale of one to ten it's about a ten in your face this shirt is
[02:00:45.590 --> 02:00:51.030]  more about like a two or three it's hey yeah everybody likes frogs save the frogs info wars
[02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:55.190]  is controversial i've heard about that what's going on well it's the controversial research
[02:00:55.190 --> 02:00:59.830]  and that's why all these big talk show hosts have attacked jones it's why literally thousands of
[02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:04.469]  publications have attacked me because it's a talking point they've been given to make a joke
[02:01:04.469 --> 02:01:09.830]  out of this so when professors and scientists and others warn people about it it becomes a big joke
[02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:15.270]  and as we continue to expand how they covertly put these chemicals in the food and water
[02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:19.910]  we're not just going to look at artificial chemicals that are being added we are also
[02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:24.469]  going to start looking at how they have genetically engineered different foods
[02:01:24.469 --> 02:01:31.350]  to make them extremely toxic take soybeans eaten by asians for thousands of years they do have some
[02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:39.510]  estrogen mimicers in them plant estrogens but with the new industrialized genetically engineered
[02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:47.510]  systems of soybean it's much much stronger and if you process whole soybeans and leave the cores in
[02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:54.710]  them it passes on extremely toxic levels of estrogen so you hear about soy boys and you
[02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:59.510]  see lots of articles saying oh no it's safe eat lots of soy and most processed foods are
[02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:06.389]  based on soy it's its main ingredient it's really messing up women it's just destroying men and if
[02:02:06.389 --> 02:02:13.110]  you see soy boys that are aggressive that are loners that don't like women and that are very
[02:02:13.110 --> 02:02:20.549]  very hateful that's exactly what primate studies show with monkeys rats rabbits and other animals
[02:02:20.549 --> 02:02:26.150]  is that it makes the males antisocial makes them very scrawny and weak but also very very hateful
[02:02:26.150 --> 02:02:31.750]  and very very aggressive and murderous just like incels almost every school shooting that
[02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:39.670]  isn't gang related is a incel who is a loner who has a very high soy diet and who basically
[02:02:39.670 --> 02:02:45.990]  feels rejected by women well the same thing exactly happens in multiple studies with monkeys
[02:02:46.549 --> 02:02:52.790]  whose neurological systems are almost identical to humans so again learn about henry ford and how
[02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:58.710]  he was working with hitler and others and was obsessed with soybeans and how he could then
[02:02:58.710 --> 02:03:05.190]  deploy soybeans around the world as a way to pacify populations hitler wasn't just planning
[02:03:05.190 --> 02:03:10.549]  to conquer the world through military might after he took out russia and the uk which was
[02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:17.030]  england at the time he was planning to control people through diet injections and injunctions
[02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:23.990]  and bertrand russell uh also won major global awards for his plans to do the same thing so
[02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:30.389]  this was developed 70 80 years ago and they're doing it through the food through the water look
[02:03:30.389 --> 02:03:35.510]  at fluoride all the big harvard studies and others admit massively lowers iq massively lowers
[02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:41.910]  fertility and now the same system is pushing dangerous gene therapy mRNA systems and virus
[02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:49.110]  vector systems that their own studies cause massive heart attacks incredible lesions on the
[02:03:49.110 --> 02:03:55.110]  heart lesions on the lungs blood clots and again they're testing putting this out there and getting
[02:03:55.110 --> 02:04:00.230]  away with soft killing us where people died a few months a few years but no one's exactly sure
[02:04:00.309 --> 02:04:04.870]  what killed them because the original testing was never officially done on these vaccines
[02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:10.309]  but they did testing before that that fauci funded to actually see it would do under other project
[02:04:10.309 --> 02:04:17.750]  names previously but with the exact same family of viruses so this is the attack on humanity this is
[02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:23.750]  their entire system this is their program and it's deadly deadly serious and and so they want us to
[02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:30.870]  celebrate now men losing their masculinity women becoming hyper feminine but but that doesn't mean
[02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:36.150]  looking sexy like maryl monroe it means looking like some type of ogre blob that by 30 has already
[02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:42.469]  her uterus and ovaries are like an 80 year old woman you see that the women look like ogre blobs
[02:04:42.469 --> 02:04:48.870]  the men look like little scrawny gremlins and and and this is their program this is their operation
[02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:53.830]  and then you learn that aldous huxley and his brother julian huxley were actually working on
[02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:59.990]  this real program that they put in the fiction book published 1932 brave new world which they
[02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:05.590]  admitted in 1961 was actually a real plan against you and your family to actually split humanity
[02:05:05.590 --> 02:05:11.830]  into two species so again it's essential to get this information out and it's essential to warn
[02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:16.950]  others and spread the word so this shirt is very high quality made right here in america printed in
[02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:25.030]  america we are selling them for 1776 at m4store.com and it helps keep us on the air and it helps you
[02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:29.750]  spread the word and it's a really good looking shirt so again i hope you'll get your save the
[02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:45.030]  frogs m4 t-shirt at m4store.com today i'm gonna say real slow for you
[02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:49.030]  the

[02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:08.950]  need a tip to shut our speech down and attack us we will defend ourselves
[02:07:16.230 --> 02:07:22.230]  all right folks there's no way to do all this news justice on this special saturday transmission so
[02:07:22.230 --> 02:07:26.230]  i'm just going to run over the headlines here in closing after the big interviews with
[02:07:26.230 --> 02:07:33.350]  santelli and with the fuentes and then uh tomorrow on the sunday show 4 to 6 p.m
[02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:40.230]  i'm going to drill more into all this news and also whatever the new news that's breaking us
[02:07:40.230 --> 02:07:46.309]  but let's just let's do it as best we can right now and just go through a hundred articles or so
[02:07:46.309 --> 02:07:52.630]  uh with just the basics here it is look at this photo of your tv viewer this says it all that's may
[02:07:52.630 --> 02:08:06.389]  2021 lumber a thousand dollars will buy you that and just six months ago seven months ago
[02:08:06.389 --> 02:08:16.469]  in the fall of 2020 you could buy more than three times more lumber same thing with steel
[02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:24.389]  same thing with corn they've all tripled or more but cnn says there is no inflation this says it
[02:08:24.389 --> 02:08:30.870]  all memorial and justice rally that happened today sacramento state capital for ashley babbit saturday
[02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:40.230]  june 5th she was murdered let's remember who really died at the capital now let's move into
[02:08:40.230 --> 02:08:45.590]  this area and again i've tried to organize these where they tie together but world economic forum
[02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:52.950]  that's the big globalist public bilderberg group pushes mit program that automatically detects
[02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:59.750]  disinformation narratives oh so taxpayer paid for government systems to add more
[02:08:59.750 --> 02:09:06.469]  censorship and control so that the criminals at the wto and the world economic forum can keep
[02:09:06.469 --> 02:09:14.950]  lying to us and it continues twitter suspends organization for announcing they will release
[02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:21.350]  more foushee emails the informed consent action network a major public policy group legally does
[02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:26.389]  the for a request to get foushee emails you're not allowed to expose the criminal what he's
[02:09:26.389 --> 02:09:34.870]  done twitter says you're suspended karma mark zuckerberg blast whistleblowers who exposed
[02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:41.990]  facebook censorship in leaked video so the leaking is the key that's why they want an internet id
[02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:47.430]  for when you do anything it puts a record of who you are so no one can put out anonymous stuff
[02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:52.630]  that's the holy grail of all this is a world id a world medical id a social credit score
[02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:55.910]  with an internet id so that you can't expose these monsters
[02:09:57.910 --> 02:10:00.870]  then all you do is just go to big public events and take those over legally and lawfully and
[02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:07.030]  expose it genetically engineered magneto protein remotely controls brain and behavior
[02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:12.469]  to be added to vaccines to help you not be depressed anymore and then they have a special
[02:10:12.469 --> 02:10:18.230]  electromagnetic systems under opa genetics and flashing lights that will make you happy london
[02:10:18.230 --> 02:10:23.590]  guardian continuing
[02:10:23.850 --> 02:10:33.210]  after 50 years the mrna revolution is here that's the headline all the news oh it's a revolution
[02:10:33.930 --> 02:10:39.450]  we're doing it we're changing your body whether you like it or not and the germans just passed a law
[02:10:39.450 --> 02:10:43.610]  to let them change your genetics where someone else takes a vaccine that's really a genetic
[02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:48.010]  takeover and then it leeches into you the germans just passed a law saying they can do that
[02:10:48.010 --> 02:10:54.970]  more articles about oh all over the london guardian everywhere oh it's the revolution
[02:10:54.970 --> 02:11:00.890]  yeah it's their globalist anti-human revolution fully vaccinated napa woman dies of covet 19
[02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:09.690]  just like the major executive over at the good folks at oracle why he took his second shot and
[02:11:09.690 --> 02:11:13.930]  died of covet so now when they kill you the vaccine they call it covet caught in a pickle
[02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:18.890]  tens of millions of americans might not have had an adequate response to the covet 19 vaccine oh
[02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:24.330]  my gosh cnn you're gonna need more shots not just three not just four not just five oh my gosh we
[02:11:24.330 --> 02:11:31.690]  told you that was coming over a year ago any menstrual changes after koba jab could be short-lived
[02:11:31.690 --> 02:11:36.170]  experts say oh yeah you're gonna have some menstrual problems are now admitting no big deal
[02:11:38.730 --> 02:11:42.970]  the big smoking gun video that they're now see breaking in the news a month after we broke it
[02:11:44.010 --> 02:11:47.930]  peter daszak admitting they created the gain of function covet 19

[02:12:46.410 --> 02:12:53.930]  brain barrier can cause cerebral hemorrhage and here's the big study on that which we already
[02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:58.250]  knew it's just more of that they'd already studied it before they did it they knew what they were
[02:12:58.250 --> 02:13:05.530]  doing here's the oracle executive joel callman the vice president 50 something years old and great

[02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:15.770]  vaccine they said it was covet big pharma now taking out big tech
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:24.520]  oracle vp dies of covet after receiving second dose he was so proud of himself though when he
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:32.360]  got it he was like look mommy wow i'm a big kid now and he's helping bring out a vaccine passport
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.480]  get vaccinated get your smartphone get started with v-safe now you're allowed to go out
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:39.960]  because we're in your body and we're taking care of you and we're dead
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:46.120]  and it goes on and on and on more scientists coming out saying that the spike protein
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.200]  is killing you in major news
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:58.240]  but let's do this let's just move that little stack
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:06.080]  right over there and let's let's let's look at this stack of news right here look at this
[02:14:07.919 --> 02:14:14.639]  California Governor Gavin Newsom reneges on surrendering emergency power to close
[02:14:14.639 --> 02:14:18.639]  everybody's restaurants but his boy he made some big profits and he was given a
[02:14:18.639 --> 02:14:24.799]  free three million dollar house but that's okay and oh now he said that you know they'd let you
[02:14:24.799 --> 02:14:29.200]  go back out and have your businesses open after June 15th and he would stop being a dictator but
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:35.839]  oh sorry just like Trudeau he's not Kentucky's vaccine lottery offers one million full ride
[02:14:35.839 --> 02:14:40.400]  scholarships how to enter oh you're getting a full ride all right once they set the precedent
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.799]  to make you take whatever they want to put in your body this vaccine doesn't cripple you or kill you
[02:14:44.799 --> 02:14:50.000]  the next one will watch Governor Newsom picks the COVID-19 vaccine lottery winners just like
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  the movie The Island you think you're winning a lottery you're actually getting sent to die
[02:14:54.879 --> 02:15:03.120]  that's okay oh but Theranos is history the big scam PCR style testing but big blood testing
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:09.280]  breakthroughs are coming post-COVID and the holy grail is robots and computers constantly testing
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:16.639]  us constantly scanning us and then announcing that we're these big evil horrible bad people.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:22.280]  Let's move on now to this stack of news.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.280]  Here's a big new Brzezinski.
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:25.760]  You can actually see the video of this online if you like.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.520]  In early times, it was easier to control a million people than to kill a million people.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:34.600]  Today, it's infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control them.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:39.440]  And here's the Indian Bar Association letter.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:45.900]  And here's the news article all about it with the head of the UN's vaccine program saying
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:51.140]  we don't want anybody allowed to have ivermectin.
[02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:57.040]  The UN is trying to block countries from giving them a cure for COVID so they can die.
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:01.060]  It's been on record antiviral for decades, it's cheap, and Big Pharma runs her so she
[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:04.200]  doesn't want you to be able to have it just like here.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:07.740]  Since when did the UN become the authority over big tech and over your doctor and over
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:08.860]  your life?
[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:11.820]  Since you were in a world government.
[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:12.900]  They launched the attack, folks.
[02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:15.140]  They launched the whole deal.
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:19.540]  Then there's this article, it's happening, and it's probably spreading.
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:24.060]  Canadian health officials baffled by mystery, deadly brain disease that suddenly popped
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:29.260]  up and has killed a bunch of men and women.
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:31.700]  And they just don't know what it is, but they think it's spreading.
[02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:32.700]  Oh, really?
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:36.740]  You take a shot, it then spreads to you.
[02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:37.740]  And that leads us to this.
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:39.060]  This is from Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:40.060]  I checked this.
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:41.060]  It's online.
[02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:47.980]  German Parliament Law for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in Human Infection
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:58.980]  Act IFSG 21 Vaccines translated on the German Parliament site at the Reichstag into English.
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.740]  In the case of the protective vaccination ordered on the basis of law or one publicly
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:09.220]  recommended by the highest state health authority or vaccine according to 17A paragraph two
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:16.180]  of the Soldiers Act, vaccines may be used that contain microorganisms that can be excreted
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:19.060]  by the vaccinated and ingested by other people.
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:31.800]  So there you go that's the shedding law right there but it's okay because the German government
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:36.360]  same ones that gives little kids the convicted pedophiles says it's okay. The German government
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:41.480]  has just passed a law that allows vaccines, vaccinations to be produced that cause the
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:46.920]  vaccinated to excrete microorganisms that can be ingested by the non-vaccinated. In simple terms
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:52.120]  those willingly injected with the vaccination would be able to pass that on to others who did
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:57.080]  not wish to take the vaccination and those who wish to resist this would have no legal recourse.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:01.960]  This law wasn't passed by accident and it is frightening window to the future that the
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:09.880]  establishment has planned for us. Oh they're not planning it it's here because after all what's in
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:17.080]  NBC, ABC, CBS every channel every day just this week and going back many years ago
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:23.640]  the same headline every day. Scientists prove kids are bad for earth. Morality suggests we stop
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:30.120]  having them. The very people that want us to die are telling us we have something to save you.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:37.560]  Would you give up having children to save the planet? Meet the couples who have what heroes.
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:44.280]  I regret having children another article. Yes she regrets it she's a good woman.
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:52.200]  Oh my but they love us they want us to die but they love us. Should we be having kids in the
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.520]  age of climate change? Well if we lock you down you can't even get together or have a job you
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:01.480]  won't have them anyways. Fertility rates plunge but China has three child policy. Seven reasons
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:07.720]  people shouldn't have children according to Science Business Insider. Yes one legacy of
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:13.800]  the pandemic maybe less judgment of the child free. No one's judging you you don't have children
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.680]  but they don't want you to have children. It's time for parents of white kids to bring the
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:24.680]  resistance home. Then it goes into how white people are bad and of course how the pandemic
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:30.680]  lockdown caused all the massive suicide. That's just some of the news but I tell you what I'm
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:37.160]  going to do. All this I got ready all this I got prepared for you but I'm not going to cover it now
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:42.440]  I will cover it one way or another on the Sunday show and I pledge to you unless there's some huge
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:46.360]  breaking news story which I'm sure there will be but I will uh judiciously get to all this.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:52.280]  Here's some of the good news and bad news over here. Federal judge overturns California's
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:58.680]  unconstitutional ban on assault weapons quite a ruling and I guess George W Bush did something
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:03.720]  good this was actually one of his judges. UK and US travelers must be vaccinated to enter France.
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:11.880]  EU looked at importing 70 million Africans by 2035 which will be a group they politically control
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.880]  and uses a permanent underclass. The ADL wants you arrested if you talk about it but that's
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:21.160]  officially been announced. Trump warns Zuckerberg next time I'm in the White House it will be all
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:25.720]  business. Well don't think you'll be back in there with election fraud unless we change that.
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:28.920]  NATO chief says org does not see China as a threat
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:39.400]  and so much more. Tomorrow night 4 p.m central and remember millions of you wonderful people
