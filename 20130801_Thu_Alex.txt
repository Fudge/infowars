[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:37.080]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are going to have another jam-packed
[00:37.080 --> 00:43.960]  incredibly important broadcast on this August 1st 2013 worldwide transmission
[00:43.960 --> 00:49.280]  it is Thursday ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us jacari Jackson is
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.560]  going to pop in with us at the bottom of the hour there's a big story in Austin
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.480]  that has gotten no national attention and jacari went out and investigated it
[01:00.480 --> 01:08.600]  it was a white cop from the info I have but some are saying Hispanic I don't know
[01:08.600 --> 01:14.240]  that shot a black guy who was simply walking away from a bank an hour after
[01:14.240 --> 01:17.360]  the bank had been robbed and the guy that reportedly robbed the bank from the
[01:17.360 --> 01:23.280]  CCTV cameras is a white guy and the Austin police officer shot the guy in
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.400]  the back of the neck and where's Jesse Jackson where's Al Sharpton and my old
[01:29.400 --> 01:35.120]  point is that you know if I want to walk away from a cop I don't want to get
[01:35.120 --> 01:39.440]  shot in the back of the neck and I'm not here to go after the police just
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.840]  because they're the police either it's just it's weird how when the cops did
[01:42.840 --> 01:48.080]  something like this the normal you know people that run around trying to stir up
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.480]  trouble aren't involved especially if it's a democratic city and the only city
[01:53.480 --> 02:01.160]  of any size in Texas that is a red area is Austin Texas and that's because of
[02:01.160 --> 02:04.640]  election fraud it's really a very libertarian conservative area believe
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.160]  me I've lived here most of my life my grandparents are from Austin my mothers
[02:09.160 --> 02:15.920]  from Austin and everyone did you understand how Terry town a tiny group
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.840]  of ultra-rich parasites that feed off all the government programs and inside
[02:20.840 --> 02:27.480]  deals how they run the city but around here there I mean we have a pretty good
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.280]  police department on average compared to a lot of cities I have to be honest
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.480]  about that but more and more the cops like every month or so are shooting
[02:36.480 --> 02:42.120]  white guys black guys you name it in the back a lot of times like you'll get out
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.480]  of your car when they tell you nothing in your hand the cop will get scared and
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.000]  they'll shoot you and it's all this instinctive training stuff I understand
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.760]  instinctive shootings a way to really draw fast and but they're not guns
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.400]  flingers in the old West but that's how they're being trained and it does make
[03:00.400 --> 03:04.440]  you a great quick draw instinctive shooter boom you know hit bullseye I
[03:04.440 --> 03:08.720]  just went was involved in about ten different or so shootout the old
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.080]  right when I got out of high school in college one of my dad's friends a dentist
[03:13.080 --> 03:18.440]  name was dr. Dillingham he did up he's a nice guy ended up moving off working for
[03:18.440 --> 03:23.080]  the US Army as a dentist but because he loved guns so much I'd go out shooting
[03:23.080 --> 03:26.040]  with him and then got into it for a while didn't have time I was working so
[03:26.040 --> 03:30.240]  many jobs and getting into radio but I would go out and do it I mean and you
[03:30.240 --> 03:36.360]  go through these these courses where you'd have stuff pop out and then you'd
[03:36.360 --> 03:40.040]  shoot it and I got really good only doing it I don't know 10 12 times I
[03:40.040 --> 03:43.520]  forget because they might have 200 people competing in it I got to be in the
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.080]  top 5% by the time I quit and there'd be all these cops getting mad look at this
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.280]  kid beating us blah blah blah but I was obviously real young and you know had
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.800]  quick instincts and I wouldn't shoot the family when it popped up and I wouldn't
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.000]  shoot them and that was paper targets people on pop you know bam and then like
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.720]  metal targets coming down you shoot at metal traps a lot of fun but I now
[04:06.720 --> 04:11.280]  digress the point is the cops are training now with laser pointers that
[04:11.280 --> 04:16.480]  that that recoil and and and all these different obstacle courses but the
[04:16.480 --> 04:19.240]  issue is somebody gets out of their car with their cell phone boom you're dead
[04:19.240 --> 04:23.640]  it's like well he thought it was a gun but that's really scary folks and I've
[04:23.640 --> 04:30.920]  told the story before of when I was senior in high school my mother said go
[04:30.920 --> 04:34.440]  up to the frozen yogurt place get me yogurt so I went out jump the car grow
[04:34.440 --> 04:36.960]  up got the yogurt probably was feeding a bit coming home
[04:36.960 --> 04:42.840]  top sees me flips around I turn into my street towards our house pull over he
[04:42.840 --> 04:46.000]  walks over goes them lies his registration he was huh pulls his gun out
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.440]  and it's like pointing it at my head and he's like get out of the car get out of
[04:48.440 --> 04:52.360]  the car and he gets a goes oh sorry you can go I thought your weight belt was a
[04:52.360 --> 04:59.880]  big knife or a gun almost blew my head off folks so I've experienced this

[08:10.880 --> 08:21.680]  GCN radio network can you believe it already the eighth month of 2013 is upon
[08:21.680 --> 08:28.520]  us it is the first day of August 2013 on this live Thursday edition Joseph Farah
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.280]  the head of the Western Journalism Center the founder of it and of course the
[08:33.280 --> 08:39.200]  head of WorldNet daily constitutional libertarian conservative outfit will be
[08:39.200 --> 08:43.080]  joining us to cover the waterfront of scandals and corruption and what where
[08:43.080 --> 08:47.920]  he thinks Obama is going to be going in the next three years he's got left or
[08:47.920 --> 08:51.960]  so in office Farah predicted back during the election we would see massive
[08:51.960 --> 08:57.080]  persecution of the Tea Party Christians conservatives libertarians and that the
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.760]  gloves would come off when Obama got reelected of course Farah had not
[09:02.760 --> 09:07.560]  supported John McCain four years previously saying you know there's no
[09:07.560 --> 09:11.160]  such thing as lesser of two evils but he said you know maybe that's wrong we
[09:11.160 --> 09:15.840]  thought maybe a bad socialist president would would make the Republicans
[09:15.840 --> 09:21.160]  become actual conservatives and could help sweep the nation for American
[09:21.160 --> 09:28.320]  ideas but it backfired and the the kleptocratic mafia has just literally
[09:28.320 --> 09:35.840]  had a a bum rush orgy of overrunning every liberty we've got butchering every
[09:35.840 --> 09:41.000]  industry we've got collectivizing the country going from 15 million people six
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.840]  years ago on food stamps to 50 plus million and 101 million on some form of
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.400]  food assistance over 130 million Americans on some form of welfare and
[09:50.400 --> 09:56.560]  it's just getting worse and that's their plan the Cloward and Piven plan is the
[09:56.560 --> 10:00.680]  public plan and of course they had previous plans to that one in the 60s
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.600]  to bankrupt once free free market countries and to make you dependent and
[10:05.600 --> 10:11.560]  poor that is the plan sorry socialism communism doesn't work except for small
[10:11.560 --> 10:18.040]  tiny groups that run it who are offshore and exempt from it it's like trying to
[10:18.040 --> 10:21.800]  explain to people you know she cake and a gun and put it in your head and pull
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.400]  in the trigger with live ammo isn't good for you and people are like no
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.240]  socialism's good uh Obamacare I get something free of course now it's
[10:30.240 --> 10:33.680]  coming out that it's bankrupting healthcare giving nobody anything free
[10:33.680 --> 10:38.720]  making 60 plus percent of the doctors begin to move to quit shutting
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.560]  everything down oh and as predicted they're in the news today I'm gonna get
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.600]  to this saying the answer is total socialist health care now it's gonna
[10:46.600 --> 10:52.760]  bankrupt things oh oh yeah oh you mean if they pay 21 million dollars to move
[10:52.760 --> 10:57.440]  General Motors to China that might make Detroit finally collapse you I didn't
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.400]  know that I I didn't know if you totally move General Motors out of Detroit it
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.680]  might actually put the final nails in the coffin gee who would have funked
[11:04.680 --> 11:08.880]  that I mean I'm not for bailing stuff out because it never works and criminal
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.240]  groups always steal the money one way or another in this kind of system but in
[11:13.240 --> 11:17.840]  Detroit would have been given 21 billion smackers over the last four years
[11:17.840 --> 11:24.440]  that place would be revitalized right now but sorry it ain't China got the
[11:24.440 --> 11:27.480]  factories all right I know I keep harping on that it's just they're
[11:27.480 --> 11:32.320]  shutting down a power plant every two and a half days in the US modern
[11:32.320 --> 11:37.080]  construction totally clean water vapor carbon dioxide come out of the stack
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.760]  nothing else so they list water vapor and carbon dioxide as toxic waste and your
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.840]  power prices are going up and America is shutting down but all the select
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.480]  globalist operations are exempt they're exempt from the regulations they're
[11:49.480 --> 11:54.600]  exempt from Obamacare the Congress is exempt the IRS is exempted itself this
[11:54.600 --> 12:02.360]  is called titles of nobility why isn't the Constitution that you can't have
[12:02.360 --> 12:06.720]  titles of nobility and being government because the title of nobility
[12:06.720 --> 12:10.400]  doesn't just mean you wear a crown or that you get to go to the elite parties
[12:10.400 --> 12:14.880]  or whatever it means you get given exemption from taxes regulations
[12:14.880 --> 12:22.880]  basically a letter of mark to operate a license license and if you don't have
[12:22.880 --> 12:30.040]  the license you can be destroyed what did our first and greatest president
[12:30.040 --> 12:46.200]  George Washington say he said the power to tax is the power to destroy and what
[12:46.200 --> 12:51.160]  is the IRS doing right now to pro-life groups libertarian groups Christian
[12:51.160 --> 12:55.600]  groups conservative groups tea party groups any group that is right of
[12:55.600 --> 13:06.200]  mouth say tongue seek and seek and destroy isn't it nice isn't it just sweet
[13:06.200 --> 13:11.080]  isn't it just cutie cake okay let me do this let me tell you what's coming up
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.280]  today Joseph Ferrer is gonna be with us for a full hour that's always informative
[13:15.280 --> 13:19.440]  as he's got his heir to the ground all over the country and worldwide and then
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.920]  we're going to be speaking coming up about 20 minutes with Jakarta Jackson on
[13:24.920 --> 13:29.680]  the big Trayvon Martin scandal you didn't hear about that happened right
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.120]  here in Austin Texas last week that has gotten zero national coverage because
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.000]  again we're a democratic city where this went on if it's a democratic run city
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.560]  you can just shoot black people all day long if you want you don't get any
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.240]  trouble but if it's a conservative area and you can make it a left right issue
[13:47.240 --> 13:50.840]  well then of course the cops are shooting people all over the country with
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.080]  this instinctive shooting training for no reason people can have nothing in their
[13:55.080 --> 13:58.960]  hand they got out of the car just I felt threatened I shot him it's like that
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.480]  guy on the dart pad in San Francisco a few years ago making a movie about that
[14:04.480 --> 14:08.960]  and he he wouldn't even in the fight wasn't involved but they they get him
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.080]  down on his belly and they shoot him in the back and the bullet bounces back up
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.120]  through his heart and then they even took their time taking over the hospital to
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.160]  make sure he died from what I saw from and they confiscated all the footage
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.960]  from people's cameras but one person was on a train at a stop and it drove off as
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.040]  the cops figured that out and got it all on tape and the police lied about it
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.640]  and said that he'd attacked them that's the new thing the FBI comes to your house
[14:31.640 --> 14:34.720]  and just sets you down for questioning and then you get shot in the back of the
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.280]  head the old days the Russians at least took you to a dungeon interrogated you
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.320]  kept you a few months took you out to walk you once a day you didn't know when
[14:42.320 --> 14:45.440]  you get the bullet in the back of the head it's kind of a humane way to run a
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.560]  Stalinistic murder operation but but here you know they just come in and get
[14:49.560 --> 14:54.200]  you to answer all the questions and then shoot you in the back of the head and
[14:54.200 --> 15:01.320]  then admit they kill you and then classify national security the autopsy
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.280]  it's kind of a cool cool it's what tough guys do I mean it it's good that the
[15:06.280 --> 15:10.160]  government has no checks and balances and can do whatever it wants that always
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.840]  goes really well in history your bank accounts are safe your kids are safe the
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.560]  government won't start big wars it can't win of course megalomaniacs to get
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.360]  control always do but so what I mean you know we're just cruising towards
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.840]  absolute destruction but everything's okay let's just drink some more fluoride
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.600]  okay so let me tell you what else is coming up here obviously Snowden granted
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.280]  one year asylum in Russia I'm gonna get into that first here in a moment then
[15:35.280 --> 15:40.720]  US to conduct joint military exercise in Egypt you mean the military that we
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.440]  have it's hijacked by foreign banks is to conduct foreign operations it's
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.800]  important to understand that and another one here more Israeli strikes likely
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.040]  Syria moves missiles before alleged Israeli strike report says how are
[15:53.040 --> 15:59.240]  well in Israel's publicly attacking Syria with cruise missiles but then they
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.480]  won't even admit they're attacking I tell you that is 1984 right there here's
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.640]  another one fed say it's classified info to say who we're at war with that came
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.520]  out of tech dirt in a congressional testimony they will not Congress will
[16:13.520 --> 16:19.200]  not be told who we're at war with oh that's that's very 1984 also Senate
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.240]  kills Rand Paul attempt to cut Egypt aid yeah let's let's not cut the aid to
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.880]  the Muslim Brotherhood massacring Christians right now US House passes
[16:29.880 --> 16:34.440]  Iran sanctions bill to slash oil exports they've now elected a moderate
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.080]  president and Iran's trying to work with the less so it's it's very important
[16:38.080 --> 16:44.920]  to to rebuff all of those deals Pentagon considers troop reductions due to cuts
[16:44.920 --> 16:48.040]  from sequester you know they got drones down to do the killing they don't need
[16:48.040 --> 16:52.200]  troops anymore and that's just some of the news on that front a solar flare
[16:52.200 --> 16:58.360]  narrowly misses earth EMP disaster barely avoided out of the examiner we're
[16:58.360 --> 17:01.480]  gonna be getting to that that's the kind of stuff we should actually be be worried
[17:01.480 --> 17:09.600]  about Rand Paul strongly hands at 2016 presidential run we've got what will
[17:09.600 --> 17:15.840]  become of Trayvon's hoodie the latest piece of iconic trial evidence for the
[17:15.840 --> 17:21.160]  Smithsonian and the George Zimmerman was pulled over in outside Dallas Texas in
[17:21.160 --> 17:28.280]  Forney I dated a girl from Forney once and he was pulled over and he had a gun
[17:28.280 --> 17:31.440]  he was speeding and the cop figures out it's George Zimmerman says well let me
[17:31.440 --> 17:35.600]  get you out cut you loose here without a ticket just with a warning cop didn't
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.080]  want to deal with that media circus and the media is like why wasn't Zimmerman
[17:40.080 --> 17:43.640]  arrested with a gun well because he has a concealed carry and that's
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.000]  reciprocal and 30 plus states thank God they're there there are concealed
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.520]  carries because those have driven down crime on average over 25% in the first
[17:53.520 --> 17:57.320]  two years it's implemented in some states you see more than 50% drops in crime
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.360]  well the national drop an overall violent crime since 1991 according to
[18:02.360 --> 18:09.600]  the Justice Department we've gone over this at nauseam he is 61% and no gun
[18:09.600 --> 18:17.200]  violence overall violent crime 61% gun violence 51% and gun homicides where
[18:17.200 --> 18:23.280]  people die 49% you can look those up for yourself so there you go I mean overall
[18:23.280 --> 18:28.880]  more guns means less crime and even though the economy is imploding and even
[18:28.880 --> 18:33.840]  though people are leaving Detroit and in other globalist control areas and
[18:33.840 --> 18:37.560]  flooding cities like Austin where I live I saw a big study in the Austin
[18:37.560 --> 18:42.120]  American States been a month ago that Austin has more poor people moving to
[18:42.120 --> 18:47.280]  it than any other city but Atlanta but you're both seen as quasi boom towns
[18:47.280 --> 18:53.920]  Austin number one Atlanta number two and you do see a lot of robbers and
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.280]  tempted carjackers getting their butts shot off you know as they move here from
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.480]  Chicago and as they move here from Detroit and as folks move here from New
[19:02.480 --> 19:05.400]  York City and they come bus to somebody's house and they're not there
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.000]  towering in fear they just shoot you with a shotgun so there are they all we
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.680]  are stacking up a lot of dead hoodlums around here but the the other side of
[19:15.680 --> 19:21.680]  that equation is the cops are actually getting shot at more in things something
[19:21.680 --> 19:26.720]  not accustomed to here in Austin Texas because everybody's been so armed in
[19:26.720 --> 19:31.360]  Texas you know it's not a very good idea to attack anybody much much less the
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.920]  police there are a lot of cops now getting shot so the it's not a ton but
[19:35.920 --> 19:39.600]  more than it used to be all over Texas so yeah cops are killing a lot of
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.260]  innocent people now that's not a very good idea is it so we'll talk to
[19:44.260 --> 19:48.400]  the carjacks and about that but first did you know the NSA director for the
[19:48.400 --> 19:53.640]  head of cybersecurity general Alexander got grilled at the black hat hacker

[26:00.640 --> 26:08.000]  time I checked just to administer the NSA hubs in their systems we're talking
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.320]  about big money here they sell sometimes thousands of dollars per data
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.120]  request that's already automated I mean it is a huge moneymaker and then they
[26:17.120 --> 26:20.520]  get to use the data and they share it with each other this is a corporate
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.760]  world government so when Alexander says the head of cybersecurity the head of
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.520]  the NSA oh I you know we don't track it with all this info and everybody that's
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.520]  actually true they're storing it they're using it and the government's kept on a
[26:33.520 --> 26:39.240]  medium leash what they can do it's the 2,000 plus companies that have basically
[26:39.240 --> 26:43.040]  got access to everything and the top fortune 500 they have access to all of
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.400]  it this is on record I'm trying to explain this to you the communist
[26:47.400 --> 26:54.960]  Chinese run the big data mining system in England and the US that's BBC one of
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.360]  the biggest this is globalism you give us control of your systems the globalist
[26:59.360 --> 27:02.960]  say China you get the Panama Canal and you get our grid and you get to say what
[27:02.960 --> 27:07.320]  movies can come out it's globalism it's all to get rid of the nation-state and
[27:07.320 --> 27:13.480]  play everybody off against each other it is just incredibly diabolical so I'm
[27:13.480 --> 27:17.440]  gonna be breaking all this down after zikari Jackson comes in with the new
[27:17.440 --> 27:21.920]  Trayvon Martin case that nobody has been covering nationally but this is really
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.040]  serious but let's go to this clip from info wars.com with Steve Watson it was
[27:27.040 --> 27:34.720]  also a local CBS with multiple security consultants heckling NSA head shouts
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.680]  freedom and read the Constitution then they said hey Alexander you lied to
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.720]  Congress and you're lying to us it shows the face of thousands of hackers
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.560]  black-hat hackers and people that counter black-hat operations that's nasty
[27:47.560 --> 27:50.960]  stuff folks just shaking their heads while he's talking because they know the
[27:50.960 --> 27:56.040]  guy is a complete liar shoveling Bravo Sierra in their face let's play that
[27:56.040 --> 28:01.280]  clip popping terrorism it's one of the most important things oh yeah right you
[28:01.280 --> 28:06.840]  run al-Qaeda on record everybody knows it and with that when you think about it
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.720]  notice he talks in that MPR voice that non-threatening cause we stand for
[28:11.720 --> 28:25.920]  freedom not that but I think what you're saying is that in these cases
[28:25.920 --> 28:32.640]  what's the decision where's the discussion and what tools should we have
[28:32.640 --> 28:51.880]  to stop those I haven't lied to Congress thank you for that but I do think
[28:51.880 --> 28:58.920]  this is important for us to have this discussion because in my opinion what
[28:58.920 --> 29:06.240]  you quickly believe is that which is written in the press without looking at
[29:06.240 --> 29:15.640]  the facts this is the greatest technical center of gravity in the world I
[29:15.640 --> 29:24.360]  ask that you all look at those facts check that out read the congressional
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.280]  testimony look at what we're talking about here because this is our nation's
[29:30.280 --> 29:34.200]  future and in there be listening carefully somebody
[29:34.200 --> 29:37.960]  shouts out read the Constitution there's more heckling to we have the full

[33:53.680 --> 33:58.360]  reason we're covering it is it it shows how the media picks and chooses what

[36:46.640 --> 36:53.040]  conquer it it's it's done scientifically and you don't see the so-called liberal
[36:53.040 --> 36:56.760]  black groups that are out there talking about 50 plus percent of black people
[36:56.760 --> 37:01.080]  being aborted and that's the highest of any group I mean there's as much as 20
[37:01.080 --> 37:05.200]  percent of white folks aboard their kids and then it moves down to Hispanics and
[37:05.200 --> 37:08.400]  others who if I was Hispanics I'd be proud that they're one of the groups that
[37:08.400 --> 37:11.560]  didn't like to kill their kids I think it's very very shameful that that
[37:11.560 --> 37:15.440]  anybody does that obviously but they sell it like you're just going to get you
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.920]  know a wart removed off your butt or something and that's not really what
[37:18.920 --> 37:22.960]  abortion is and now you see MSNBC almost every week and CNN going you know
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.640]  babies after birth let's kill disabled babies or even you don't like the sex
[37:27.640 --> 37:32.720]  of them it's your choice as a parent up to age three to kill your kid and we
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.880]  first broke that from the Journal of the of bioethics a few years ago people
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.560]  didn't believe it for about a week and then finally it was national news that
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.120]  that they were in there saying let's kill kids up to age three even if they're
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.000]  healthy just you know we're the bioethicists they're going to decide to
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.680]  decide if you're really alive or if your lives were something and you know old
[37:54.680 --> 37:59.080]  people they're not really happy let's just kill them that's why Mark Dice went
[37:59.080 --> 38:03.600]  out last week we put the video up when he premiered it a few days ago on info
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.080]  works dot com prison planet dot com we played clips over here and he showed
[38:07.080 --> 38:12.120]  everybody you talked to only one person said is this a joke all the others said
[38:12.120 --> 38:18.400]  oh yes I think we should get rid of all the old people we should euthanize them
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.720]  and it was old people saying it saying I don't want to be alive when I feel bad
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.280]  well see you're not gonna be getting healthcare you're gonna get euthanized
[38:26.280 --> 38:31.080]  ladies and gentlemen and this is the way of it this is eugenics this is how
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.320]  it started in Nazi Germany and look I've already digressed I want to get the
[38:34.320 --> 38:40.160]  new report the point is is that I don't know the last few years it's got to be
[38:40.160 --> 38:44.040]  more than 10 cases the last few months I've heard about three or four of them
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.040]  where Austin cops where I live pull somebody over the white guy Hispanic
[38:49.040 --> 38:51.840]  black it doesn't matter you get out of your car they've killed people of every
[38:51.840 --> 38:56.760]  quote race they get out day night doesn't matter and the cop has been trained
[38:56.760 --> 39:00.120]  for instinctive shooting thinks they see something and thinks we're at the okay
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.920]  corral and boom shoot you boom you're dead and then it's like well they were
[39:05.920 --> 39:10.480]  scared and that's why the police defended Zimmerman so much because they
[39:10.480 --> 39:13.680]  understand you're in a fight you're in a situation they don't know what happened
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.000]  you've got reasonable doubt but at a certain point even when it's in areas
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.840]  with surveillance cameras they they grab that they don't release the dash cam
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.200]  footage in Austin this is going on and you've got this detective a white
[39:26.200 --> 39:30.320]  detective by the way we had to dig to find that this happened last week white
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.560]  detective like something out of a movie hour after the banks robbed he's there
[39:34.560 --> 39:38.600]  it's a white guy on the surveillance footage that's the suspect we're gonna
[39:38.600 --> 39:45.080]  show that jacar as you ask for important a moment he chases a guy you know a
[39:45.080 --> 39:49.360]  fellow walks in black guy sees all the cops everything goes whoop it was mad a
[39:49.360 --> 39:52.000]  warrant or something who knows that's not in the news sure they would have told
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.280]  us it was a case those little bunch of cops kind of like open the door as much
[39:55.280 --> 39:58.800]  a star stormtroopers and Star Wars are like I think I'll get out of here and
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.920]  so he goes walks on the street cop starts chasing him and you know I know
[40:03.920 --> 40:07.040]  the instinct before I had cops behind before and thought about just you know
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.200]  you know let's see how fast this baby can go but the guy runs the cop
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.040]  commandeers that somebody's car chases him and shoots him in the back of the
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.280]  neck now jacar you've you've been really researching this and so fill us in on
[40:20.280 --> 40:25.000]  what happened and the fact that this is barely even local news here's the KVUE
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.120]  story new details released an officer involved shooting last week you show up
[40:30.120 --> 40:36.760]  yesterday with our camera guy there's cops waiting basically trying to run you
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.400]  off yeah and and we've got all that on tape but but I kind of butchered the
[40:41.400 --> 40:45.120]  story break down what's happened the fellow they killed where this is going
[40:45.120 --> 40:48.120]  because it's it's getting pretty scary the state police I'm afraid are going to
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.960]  pull me over in Texas now they do proctology exams just randomly and use
[40:51.960 --> 40:56.200]  the same glove now they've got weird army checkpoints my wife ran into with
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.120]  Hitler youth up in Waco like I haven't even aired that footage off her iPhone
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.360]  yet and then and then I'm afraid about cop things I'm walking away one of our
[41:04.360 --> 41:07.600]  reporters was walking home the other night and cops jumped came out of a
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.480]  house party in her neighborhood was Lee and ran over to her and ask what she
[41:12.480 --> 41:15.200]  was doing obviously she was attractive yeah and it was like going into the
[41:15.200 --> 41:18.600]  party watch it honey do you ever by the hair like cavemen they don't you know
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.200]  go dragging her off but yeah I'm ranting here jacar tell us about this case the
[41:22.200 --> 41:25.320]  guy's name and what's happened well the gentleman that you're talking about is
[41:25.320 --> 41:29.640]  Larry Jackson he like you said he went to a bank after had been robbed now this
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.600]  is a daytime bank robbery the man goes to the bank after had been robbed I'm not
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.920]  sure if they had police tape or what the situation was goes tries to open the
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.600]  door the door is locked somebody comes out the bank manager says sir what are
[41:40.600 --> 41:43.760]  you doing he's like well I'm just here to make a transaction now this is where
[41:43.760 --> 41:46.600]  it gets little if you they say the man presented some type of falsified
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.240]  identification now but see first they said the man ran I'm going with their
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.600]  old line that's that's still that's still a lot of story the full story so the
[41:54.600 --> 41:57.320]  man present some identification when I was talking to the assistant police
[41:57.320 --> 42:00.680]  chief yesterday he wouldn't specify what that was if it was a fake ID if it was a
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.520]  forged check to what it was they might have said I'm not telling you my name I
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.800]  could have been in as well so the man comes in contact with the officer
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.040]  detective Kleinerd I believe what's his name and they have a brief exchange the
[42:12.040 --> 42:15.160]  man says I'm not staying here I'm leaving and off says you're not allowed to
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.160]  leave the guy walks off the walk turns into a run runs down the street and
[42:19.160 --> 42:23.080]  Josh and I film this and we'll get to that special report in a second and the
[42:23.080 --> 42:26.760]  guy runs down the street the officer for whatever reason decides to commandeer
[42:26.760 --> 42:30.680]  somebody's vehicle like James Bond commandeer somebody's vehicle drives down
[42:30.680 --> 42:35.080]  the street meets up with a guy they have a physical altercation underneath the
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.760]  bridge and the man ends up with a bullet in the back of his neck and the
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.800]  story has been changing from when I saw last week I mean who knows what the
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.720]  truth is because so often they lie and they're really I mean they're acting
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.720]  suspicious too I mean you show up days later days yeah how many days later this
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.680]  happened on Friday I believe it was and we just had a chance to go out out of
[42:56.680 --> 43:00.520]  the studio yesterday myself and Josh and we'll get to this in the video we go to
[43:00.520 --> 43:04.200]  the bank like five days later four days later we park across the street because
[43:04.200 --> 43:07.080]  we're driving up and I'm like I'm not gonna park in their parking lot because
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.520]  I know they don't kick us out so we park at a grocery store clearly across the
[43:10.520 --> 43:14.280]  street we get ready I say I'm gonna go inside and talk to the bank manager and
[43:14.280 --> 43:17.760]  Josh was like okay I'll just stay out here and shoot some b-roll good and I walk
[43:17.760 --> 43:21.960]  across the street the second my foot hits the curb with what has to be the
[43:21.960 --> 43:26.200]  fastest response time in APD history a man runs out the bank what are you guys
[43:26.200 --> 43:30.760]  doing maybe it's cuz you're black maybe I don't know what it was shoot you a little better and
[43:30.760 --> 43:34.520]  I'm joking yeah hopefully not but I get across the street and the guys like what
[43:34.520 --> 43:37.960]  are you doing I was like yeah you can see it right there as I'm going into bank and
[43:37.960 --> 43:40.480]  then when he sees my camera that's when he gets a little more friendly and he
[43:40.480 --> 43:43.720]  shakes my hand and so forth and he and after that he was pretty well mannered
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.880]  and he said well they prefer that you you call ahead and I said well sir you know
[43:47.880 --> 43:51.120]  I'm already here can I just go in and talk to the bank manager and he says well
[43:51.120 --> 43:54.040]  you know I don't really want that I said well will you talk to him he said yeah
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.040]  but it's a I mean you're nice about this and I tell the reporters don't get
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.080]  conversations but I would have said it's a free country I'm going in there yeah
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.920]  I mean I'm getting tired of this oh yeah and of course I'm being sarcastic
[44:02.920 --> 44:06.040]  about the cop gonna shoot you but the point is I mean he does run over there
[44:06.040 --> 44:10.120]  towards you and I mean wow they're really on this story they don't want people
[44:10.120 --> 44:14.320]  talking to the witnesses and I guess that was the point and they leave us out
[44:14.320 --> 44:17.600]  there about 10 15 minutes meanwhile a helicopter flies overhead I'm not sure if
[44:17.600 --> 44:20.640]  that was related or not it's just something weird that happened part of
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.120]  living in a free country yeah part of living in a free country and you were
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.200]  walking while black yes I was walking while black and it just so happened that
[44:28.200 --> 44:31.080]  you know that matter you're wearing a suit that's not even enough now yeah I
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.240]  was dressing you know you know a crown to be like the Queen of England then he
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.760]  would have like bowed down to you yeah if I was walking over you had a shaved
[44:36.760 --> 44:40.600]  head though like him you should like that yeah but you know like I was saying
[44:40.600 --> 44:44.760]  we were out there and the bank manager comes about 10 15 minutes later or a
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.480]  bank representative and meanwhile APD calls us could we call to talk to their
[44:48.480 --> 44:51.760]  public information officer they call us back while we're at the bank I'm say
[44:51.760 --> 44:54.400]  well just so you guys know I just encountered officer he's leaving us
[44:54.400 --> 44:57.440]  outside for 10 15 minutes I'm not exactly sure what he's doing just know
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.080]  that we're out here let's say okay just come and meet with us at 1245 at the APD
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.040]  headquarters so we talked to the bank representative and he doesn't give us any
[45:05.040 --> 45:08.280]  information so we should I stand up go to APD and that's when we talked to
[45:08.280 --> 45:13.400]  assistant chief I'll keep on calling Bradley Manning but his name is Manley
[45:13.400 --> 45:18.880]  so Brian Manley yeah Brian Manley he's very manly he was very manly is a very
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.480]  very nice gentleman he didn't give us too much in a way of information and one
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.920]  the questions I asked him you know I said if this is an ongoing investigation
[45:25.920 --> 45:28.760]  you say you know the shooting is on investigation why did he chase him that's
[45:28.760 --> 45:32.360]  under investigation and so forth how do you know that the man was there to
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.520]  commit a fraud mr. Jackson and he said well you know of course that's still
[45:36.520 --> 45:40.000]  part of the ongoing investigation but you know the shooting why the officer
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.040]  unholstered his weapon that's under investigation but the fact that the man
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.520]  was there to commit a fraud that's a concrete fact and by the way if the
[45:47.520 --> 45:52.360]  suspect was black what would a bank robber come back later I would see some
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.360]  reason to pursue but it's like looks like a redneck hillbilly and in the in the
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.360]  main suspect videos and then a black guy comes and talks to the manager starts
[46:00.360 --> 46:03.840]  walking away going I don't want to talk to you I don't and then you end up dead
[46:03.840 --> 46:07.360]  and that's happening more and more all over the country yeah and that people
[46:07.360 --> 46:11.640]  keep saying that the man had no reason to run like Anthony Bealer said he said
[46:11.640 --> 46:16.200]  the reason the fact of the guy's dead now shows that he had a reason to run well
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.360]  let me tell you I'm actually now when I'm with my kids I'm actually scared of
[46:20.360 --> 46:23.320]  the state police because they're still shot I mean they'll pull you over in front
[46:23.320 --> 46:28.480]  of your family and literally stick their hands in your in your rear end I mean
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.320]  that is horrifying man and it's just another case we see because we saw the
[46:32.320 --> 46:35.920]  case in Toronto I believe it was this past weekend as well a gentleman was on
[46:35.920 --> 46:40.680]  the boxcar I think the guy's 18th name was Sammy Yadam and he steps he's not
[46:40.680 --> 46:44.240]  even stepping off the bus he has a knife you can see the video right there he has
[46:44.240 --> 46:46.400]  a knife in the sand please tell him to drop the knife he doesn't drop the
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.480]  knife now as you can see in this clip Alex they're close enough to him to use
[46:49.480 --> 46:53.360]  maybe a chemical agent use some beanbags and they shoot him over and
[46:53.360 --> 46:56.880]  over and over and over they shoot him nine times in this clip almost like the
[46:56.880 --> 47:01.640]  95 year old got the nursing home that had a shoehorn and he had a cane he had a
[47:01.640 --> 47:05.280]  shoehorn and then they said he allegedly grabbed a butcher knife and was waving
[47:05.280 --> 47:08.640]  around even if he did have a butcher knife he think he could probably snatch
[47:08.640 --> 47:12.280]  a knife from a 95 year old man and they shoot him with a beanbag well I would
[47:12.280 --> 47:15.800]  just lock the door until he settled down yeah but no it's like tough to kill
[47:15.800 --> 47:19.040]  somebody because I mean you're not even a man until you've killed some people you
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.720]  know according to these great that's that's what we'll see there's soldiers
[47:21.720 --> 47:25.040]  they're designed to kill people break things and so you're like an enemy of
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.880]  Iwo Jima and this is the mindset now what the cops don't get is that police
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.160]  are supposed to be peace officers you're supposed to be so macho you don't go and
[47:35.160 --> 47:40.280]  just kill people as the first first first idea that's what thugs do yeah and
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.120]  the guy was looking for a fight the cop was looking for a fight you know he
[47:43.120 --> 47:46.520]  chased the guy down on foot first then commandeered a vehicle he was going to
[47:46.520 --> 47:49.520]  catch this guy when he meets up to him I guess the guy put up more of a fight than
[47:49.520 --> 47:52.880]  he wanted and somehow another guy ends up with a bullet we don't even know that's
[47:52.880 --> 47:57.320]  true body he's shot in the back yeah it was very suspicious to me that's just the
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.880]  story I was told well let's go ahead and go to your news report right here and
[48:00.880 --> 48:03.800]  we'll go out to break and come out and finish up with us with Jakari Jackson and
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.160]  this is happening all the time now where I live let's go and go to this clip we're
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.120]  here at the benchmark bank you just saw a moment ago we stepped out of our
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.680]  vehicle which is across the street where my cameraman Josh is we came across the
[48:14.680 --> 48:17.760]  street to the benchmark bank we were immediately approached by officer he
[48:17.760 --> 48:20.360]  said sir what are you doing here I said I'm just here to speak to the bank
[48:20.360 --> 48:23.440]  manager he said well they prefer that you call before you come I said well I'm
[48:23.440 --> 48:26.440]  not looking for a problem officer can you go get the bank manager for me the
[48:26.440 --> 48:29.480]  officer agreed so that's what we're doing now so you saw just moments ago we
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.040]  were approached by both an officer and a representative of the benchmark bank now
[48:33.040 --> 48:36.080]  the reason why we're here is because last Friday a gentleman tried to enter the
[48:36.080 --> 48:38.600]  bank after the bank had been robbed obviously the gentleman did not know
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.800]  this keep in mind the gentleman who came to the bank after been robbed did not
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.640]  match the description of the suspect at all the gentleman presented
[48:45.640 --> 48:48.960]  identification to the bank then an officer approached the man the man did
[48:48.960 --> 48:52.280]  not want to talk to the officer decided to walk away from the situation that
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.760]  walk turned into a run a foot chase ensued the officer eventually caught up
[48:56.760 --> 49:00.000]  to the man at a nearby park there was an alleged struggle and somehow or
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.640]  another the man ended up with a bullet in the back of his neck first of all do
[49:03.640 --> 49:08.120]  you think was the appropriate response of your officer to chase the man yes the
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.320]  police department does have a pursuit policy a foot pursuit policy that
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.520]  dictates when our officers can be engaged the foot chase ended under the
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.680]  Shull Creek Bridge over off of 34th Street and their struggle ensued under
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.960]  that bridge during the foot pursuit detective Kleiner did enlist the aid of
[49:25.960 --> 49:30.480]  a motorist to help him catch back up to mr. Jackson do you know at what point
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.600]  the officer removed his holster what's a knocked out did he pull it out do you
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.040]  know exactly what happened that's still part of the ongoing investigation as far
[49:37.040 --> 49:40.280]  as striking an unarmed man in the back in the back of the neck do you think
[49:40.280 --> 49:44.920]  that's justified I can't speculate on that is the officer involved still in
[49:44.920 --> 49:50.080]  active duty yes the officer per our standard policy is on restricted duty
[49:50.080 --> 49:53.000]  with pay now it's my understanding that the gentleman has some type of false
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.800]  identification can you specify what that is again due to the ongoing nature of
[49:57.800 --> 50:00.440]  the investigation there are some pieces that we're not releasing we have this
[50:00.440 --> 50:03.960]  ongoing investigation as far as you know when the officer unholstered his weapon
[50:03.960 --> 50:07.320]  when exactly he fired the weapon but you're pretty confident in saying that
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.960]  he was there the gentleman was there to commit a fraud that's his prior history
[50:10.960 --> 50:16.960]  have anything to do with that conclusion we have not released mr. Jackson's full
[50:16.960 --> 50:21.760]  criminal history we don't want it we're not attempting to challenge his
[50:21.760 --> 50:27.440]  credibility anytime a life is lost it's tragic and it's tragic for mr. Jackson's
[50:27.440 --> 50:31.960]  family as a law enforcement family it's tragic for us our officer is you know
[50:31.960 --> 50:35.280]  having a hard time with this as well now I can't help but notice the similarities
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.200]  between this case and the George Zimmerman Trayvon Martin case whereas the
[50:39.200 --> 50:42.560]  person with the gun aggressively pursued the person without the gun and when an
[50:42.560 --> 50:46.560]  altercation ensue the person with the gun opened fire all right just so happens
[50:46.560 --> 50:51.720]  and that is what the subject of the new august issue is all about by the way in
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.400]  the new magazine is out info wars store dot com we'll have conclusions and final

[57:32.600 --> 57:36.640]  jacari in the last minute we've got any other comments about this tragic case of
[57:36.640 --> 57:43.560]  Mr. Jackson Larry Eugene Jackson Jr. 32 here in Austin Texas and the police
[57:43.560 --> 57:47.040]  they're acting very suspicious if they didn't have something to cover up I
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.000]  don't think they'd be acting like this yeah and it's unfortunate Acevedo is
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.880]  out of town he I believe he's in California dealing with his mother his
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.640]  mother's ill from what I understand to hear that yeah but this is the situation
[57:57.640 --> 58:01.800]  overzealous police chase a man down and shoot him you know like you said we're
[58:01.800 --> 58:05.520]  not sure if they're just shot him in the leg I mean just running to deserve to
[58:05.520 --> 58:09.520]  die I mean I don't know I mean and then the just the note I think a tray bomb was
[58:09.520 --> 58:13.560]  running from from Zimmerman he should go to prison for that yeah trying to defend
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.680]  yourself from you know oversell his person it's it's a very unfortunate
[58:17.680 --> 58:20.840]  circumstance and hopefully gets a bottom of it and I really want to know how they
[58:20.840 --> 58:24.880]  know what the man was there to commit a fraud if you know they don't want to be
[58:24.880 --> 58:29.200]  explicit with that information you know they're very closed mouth about it right
[58:29.200 --> 58:31.880]  now I would add this there they've been killing a lot of white people like this
[58:31.880 --> 58:35.200]  too oh yeah I don't see one loving it might be racial though we don't know my
[58:35.200 --> 58:39.480]  point is is what scary is that it's just a total culture to kill us it's

[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.800]  is going to be joining us to cover the waterfront first I'll say hey what's
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.320]  for front and center on your radar screen when we get this kind of guess on I'd
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.920]  like to cover the waterfront and then I'll get into the latest on Snowden getting
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.880]  political asylum in Russia Bradley Manning we'll get all what's happening in the middle east
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.640]  we'll go over Rand Paul he's going to run for president that's guaranteed that's always been
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.400]  the plan I could tell you right now I'll just leave it at that and by the way I can get Rand Paul
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.440]  on the show they make a big deal of it when he comes on they attack him they demonizing
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.840]  it doesn't even boost our ratings when he comes on I've known the guy for 14 15 years
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.440]  so that's why we don't even get Rand Paul on last time he was on he called us to come on
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.440]  and then they make a big national issue out of it and I think overall it's you know not
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.320]  positive for him so we don't even get him on that's how we operate around here but you know what
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:24.120]  it's been about a year since it's been on maybe it's time to get him get Rand Paul here on the
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.400]  transmission and you know why should we let them dictate who can come on the show by by demonizing
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.000]  him even though I can get him on the show I still leave him alone because I know it causes a
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.160]  conniption fitness operation whenever he does it that's why Rand Paul so great we always have
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:45.480]  c-span on him like every week I see him in there live just just he just gets better and better
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:52.360]  and now he's diffusing Chris Christie going hey why don't we get a beer uh stop acting like I'm bad

[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.560]  just gets more and more popular so does Ted Cruz I'd make a good ticket Rand Paul Ted Cruz the
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.600]  Paul names bigger so he should be the presidential candidate and the vice president the Ted Cruz
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:16.440]  that'd be power packed right there doesn't matter the robots do the voting in so many areas yeah
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  plus Ted Cruz didn't he from Canada they were u.s citizens and then they had him up there
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.000]  that's right he's eligible that's right I mean well John McCain was born in the Panama Canal

[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:52.360]  was Barry Cetero and then now Obama goes on radio shows and stuff goes hey it's Barry people used to
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:59.160]  call me that he's like inoculating people psychologically but he had like a couple other

[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:43.000]  first day of august 2013 i'm alex jones of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i know we
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.120]  have a lot of new affiliates picking us up all the time and some people are not familiar with the
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:54.040]  show i am a syndicated radio host documentary filmmaker and a constitutionalist libertarian
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:00.680]  paleo conservative and the media today calls anybody who's not a complete authoritarian
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.640]  communist a right-wing extremist and so if standing for liberty and freedom means i'm a right-wing
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:12.520]  extremist then i will also take that mantle on when i criticize bush for attacks on civil
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.720]  liberties and freedoms i was called a hardcore commie by the controlled right wing the establishment
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:23.800]  rhino christ christy types no i'm someone that stands for the bill of rights and constitution
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.880]  and i know that joseph ferrah founder of the western journalism center and a man who of course ran
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.320]  big newspapers across the united states before that and founded back in 1996 world net daily
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:43.800]  a pioneer along with a drugs report dot com wnd dot com uh a pioneer in publishing uh filmmaking
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:50.040]  radio shows you name it a pioneer uh really in taking the the old muck raking real journalism
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:57.240]  americana type journalism uh and putting it into the 21st century and of course uh ted newgent
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.920]  writes for them as well ted contacted me and said carry his stuff as well i don't think we ever do
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:09.720]  that but we probably should over at info wars dot com but wnd dot com uh and he he joins us uh here
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.640]  today on the broadcast to talk about a whole host of issues but first off joseph when you said a few
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:20.600]  years ago in the air that when obama got reelected get ready for the hammer to drop boy you weren't
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.720]  kidding the persecution of tea party telling pro-life groups what they can pray targeting the
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:33.160]  associated press uh prosecuting whistleblowers now obama behavioral insight teams um biopics on
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:43.160]  hillary clinton cia domestically brainwashing uh promoting uh the kleptocratic uh agenda of the
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:50.040]  socialist progressives i mean this is like a twilight zone episode i'm alex jones the supposed
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.200]  crazy guy that you know thought all this would happen and it happened it's getting even crazier
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:59.960]  than i thought it would get this fast joe joseph era what in the new world order is going on here
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.760]  well uh the good news is that obama is kind of bringing you know some of the left and right
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.760]  together you know if you want to use those labels uh especially with regard to the surveillance state
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.680]  that he you know look he didn't invent this it's been creeping up on us for for decades and you know
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:26.200]  but he's basically put it on steroids and and i think that there's you know reaction from uh
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:32.120]  you know folks on the left who who actually have a conscience you know people like that
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.880]  head off and folks like that and you know some some members of the senate and house and the
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:45.000]  democratic side have been really at the forefront of protesting uh this this uh
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:52.200]  just unbelievable big brother kind of situation you know they're just you know you and i we knew
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:59.480]  about the nsa for a long time this was no surprise to us you know it's been around for a long time
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:06.920]  it is obviously it's getting worse technology improves uh it makes it more feasible for government
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:13.080]  to gather more information on us more easily that's what's been happening and now we've got a guy in
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:20.520]  the white house who you know he basically believes in unlimited government that's that's the key i think
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:28.280]  to understanding where we are right now that's a completely unamerican principle uh america is
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:34.760]  founded on constitutionally limited government the federal government has a straight jacket on
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:41.240]  its power uh intentionally conceived by the founders and you know obviously there have been
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:48.440]  abuses to that over 230 some years but now we're at the point where we have a president at a state
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:55.000]  and we have many many members of congress republican and democrats who basically believe there are no
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.440]  constitutional restraints on what the government can do and that's why uh you know they vote in
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:10.840]  favor of preserving and and even expanding this incredible uh abusive surveillance state that
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:16.600]  they've created all in the name of fighting terrorism i gotta tell you something alex um
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:23.240]  the worst kind of terrorism that's ever plagued people in the history of the world is government
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.440]  terrorism and that's what we're we're up against in america today of all places it's it's shocking
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:37.560]  and by the way they try to to cast or frame what you say is radical that is americana
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.600]  that's what the country was founded out of the the flower of the renaissance uh that was the
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:49.160]  entire idea that's what they'd been through they knew that governments killed 262 million people
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:55.560]  according to the university of hawaii study and democide in the 20th century non-military combatants
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:02.040]  deaths that's men women and children we all know this from polpot to adolf hitler to joe
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:09.800]  Stalin to mausetongue to uh people like fidel Castro and then we get up and say that's tyranny
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:15.240]  this is a threat and they go oh you're crazy but i think the good news is this coming out of the
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.040]  kleptocratic tyrants this coming out of the statist i think has finally gotten people to start to
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.480]  wake up are you seeing a giant awakening taking place well i don't know if it's a giant awakening
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:34.360]  but i think it's very uh encouraging let's say that this is not a debate that is strictly along
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:40.920]  party lines or i you know the the traditional kind of ideological line it's really about people who
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:48.600]  who i think you know believe in the constitution or at least parts of it and uh and those who
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:55.080]  don't those who really think there are no limits to government and that we'd be crazy in america
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:03.640]  to to uh to succumb to uh the constitutional restraint and and that really makes it a lot easier
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:11.080]  i think for people to understand now you know there's this problem uh there is terrorism you know
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:18.520]  there is this outside terrorism thing i you know me i've been you know i've been exposing uh the
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:24.840]  muslim brotherhood for i believe it's real i don't believe it was invented to scare americans
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:30.280]  there are threats that we face in the real world but the question that we have to ask ourselves
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:37.720]  as americans is are we willing to give up everything that's beautiful and you know all the the
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:46.440]  liberties that uh that uh abounded at the founding of this country uh it over you know over this
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:52.840]  fight with a bunch of terrorists and i i say the answer is clearly no and i think we have an
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:59.480]  opportunity with you know the media exposure think about this alex ten years ago was the media
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:07.480]  writing about the nfa the nfa was doing you know 90 of what it's doing right now ten years ago
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:12.360]  and nobody was concerned about it well americans you know they they really were in the dark
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.880]  you knew this i knew this your audience knew it my w&d's audience knew it but you know 99
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:25.560]  percent of americans did not know that the government was in their bedroom it was on their
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.600]  telephone calls it was you know looking at what they were typing on their computer and what
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.720]  websites they were visiting it was tracking them with their cell phones you know this was all
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:42.280]  happening before well now they know it and there is you know if you look at the polls is very encouraging
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.520]  americans don't like it in fact there's a poll out today i believe it shows americans are more
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:56.760]  uh fearful of government surveillance like the nfa's than they are of terrorism that's a breakthrough
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:03.080]  well there's an article out today that if you google uh pressure cookers uh you get a visit from
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.040]  the police it just gets more and more ridiculous they're spying on everything i mean you see stories
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.360]  all the time we're in france somebody makes a joke on a text message and the cops are there an hour
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:18.920]  later it it's all being read it's unconstitutional and i want to quantify this since you raised it
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.760]  i know there have been radical extreme muslims since they attacked europe you know hundreds of
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.040]  years ago right and then that responded with the crusades i know there's been wahhabis before
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:34.440]  saudi arabia was saudi arabia my point is is that they use that threat which is overblown
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.760]  to then target the tea party libertarians gun owners look at how they say now the threat isn't
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.880]  muslim extremists it's libertarians gun owners returning veterans that's what i said and i pointed
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.080]  out our government helped organize al-qaeda uh in the fight against the russians they helped protect
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:55.160]  them they turned a blind eye to it they're now using them as the main force against syria in libya
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:02.360]  our government you know help bring a you know kick out the old dictator of uh of uh of uh
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:08.520]  egypt to put in the new you know front guy moracy uh who was you know many many times worse than
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:14.520]  hazy mubarak so my point is is that they're they are using radicalism to take over areas
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.880]  to stabilize things they want while separately using it to take our liberties away exactly right
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:27.160]  that's the way it works and of course the real answer to you know preparing americans to do battle
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:35.320]  with any enemy whether it's terrorism or a more conventional kind of uh threat is you know we've
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:42.360]  always been armed americans have always been armed you know uh that's why it's never been invaded
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.160]  by any foreign power right and so you know but what are they trying to do they're trying to take
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:55.720]  our guns away and and so you that that puts the lie to the fact that they really want to do anything
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:03.000]  about terrorism and there's a report out today uh that says that you know they've been saying well
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:12.520]  look how many terrorist uh operations have been uh thwarted because of this NSA spying and it turns
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:19.160]  out there really are only two that they can even substantiate as having anything to do with this
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.360]  program so in our entire free society over something that's less dangerous than honeybees
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.080]  right i mean i've just had it i agree with jesse ventura i just say let the danger let it be there
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.720]  will deal with what happens that that's the way it is and if we really catch some country attacking
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.520]  it's they'll be reprisals it's ridiculous i mean it's it's all being used to power grab

[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:29.240]  you should reject these voices there you go because what they suggest is that our brave
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:36.920]  and creative and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham with which we can't be trusted
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:42.120]  talk about brainwashing he acts like you're attacking america if you're worried about keeping
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.720]  the country free saying the government is the people will know it's not it's exempting itself
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.280]  from everything it's foisting on the people fundamentally and then saying if you've got a
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:57.320]  business you didn't build that somebody else made that happen and of course we're all co
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.200]  collectively connected but it's the power of the individual that then raises the power of the
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:08.680]  collective and the individual is at the head the individual is sovereign not the government and the
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:14.680]  and the big brain bugs on top directing the overall architecture and now joe's affair
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:20.520]  are the head of worldnetdaily.com why do you think they're just coming out in the public with
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.080]  everything now and throwing it in our face is it an attempt to just acclimate us or since they
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.800]  can't hide it they're going to go ahead and flaunt it and maybe move the overton window
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.760]  is this some move towards learned helplessness or a Stockholm syndrome what's happening well
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:41.640]  look i think the the agenda is very clear you know from obama and and not just obama but
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:48.760]  you know obama epitomizes it that uh you know what these guys really like and have always liked
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:55.000]  for most of their lives is socialism that's what they where they want to take us uh or that you
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.040]  call it communism or socialism you know same same difference and a good example of this right from
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:10.040]  obama's mouth uh in the last two days was you know his high praise for ho chi min now you know
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:16.120]  we can we can debate the vietnam war and our role in it but ho chi min was a communist who tortured
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:23.240]  americans or marxist led in this Stalinist who killed 500 000 of his own people now they want to
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:29.560]  portray him as some kind of popular folk hero in vietnam the george washington of vietnam inspired
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:36.440]  by thomas jefferson you know gosh we have known this for decades that that was a clever ruse that
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:42.680]  ho chi min used to try to get uh you know the american government to support uh him back in the
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:49.320]  1950s when uh it went uh you know truman was still president and later in the eisenhower years
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:55.240]  but they know we know what ho chi min was and now they're trying to recast ho chi min
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.320]  but just like they did you know they did in the 1960s it was a communist disinformation
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.840]  effort and um and and now obama's using a president of the united states is portraying
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:14.440]  ho chi min this mass murderer this terrorist uh you know how did he was he popular among his
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.720]  people you know hitler was popular among his people the way totalitarian has become popular
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.400]  as they kill the opposition or they lock them up in the reeducation oh yeah i love how how
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.960]  how to quote fake democracy they used to bring an authoritarianism not a republic they go well we
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.320]  have a majority let's say turn your guns in like i've got to do something because a pack of idiots
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:41.800]  want me to exactly exactly that's the that's the opposite of of what you know the american founding
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:48.520]  was all about you know protecting the the uh the the rights of the minority we don't live in a
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:55.080]  democracy we live in a constitutional republic there's huge differences and unfortunately american
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.440]  people have been so dumbed down over such a long period of time that you know now we want to be like
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:07.560]  everybody else in the world that's what the founders were uh you know dead set against but i mean
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:13.800]  there is a sense that i see on the street across the board folks understand that obama and and the
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.520]  people that are controlling him really have conned them people know the economy's in deep trouble
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.360]  they know they're becoming domesticated but the collectivists don't care because when they shut
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:28.360]  down coal plants or pay to move general motors uh to china then you've got 101 million people as of
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:33.240]  last month as you know now on some form of food assistance i mean land of the free home of the
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.000]  brave 101 million people on food assistance that's right you create the dependence we've seen it done
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  and you know in many minority communities to the point where they they go and they vote like robots
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.720]  for the people who are going to keep those those little you know uh gratuities coming to them uh
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:57.400]  every month and and that is really sad instead of being you know so teaching self-reliance and
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:05.560]  from you know uh and and and and being a self-governing society we're becoming a bunch of sheep
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:11.080]  that are actually dependent we think on on the government's uh goodwill toward us
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:17.560]  Joseph Farah of wnd.com is our guest we've got him to the end of the hour we have a long 18

[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:41.720]  into the persecution of the press not just conservatives or libertarians and where joseph
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.720]  era thinks all that's going on we'll talk about a new film they've got we're not carrying yet but
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.760]  we need to that's available at world net daily made out of the book disinformation that has very
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:56.440]  powerful book and i'm glad it's been made into film to understand how the propaganda state works
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.720]  because of obama's behavioral insight teams and and others saying the cia is going to be involved
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:07.320]  domestically in the pentagon uh really really uh you know signs of the fact that as the government
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.800]  it's more and more corrupt and collapses it becomes more and more authoritarian but that
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:16.280]  that big question before i get into general alexander being heckled we're going to play a clip of that
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:22.840]  joseph era where do you think the world in general is going i mean i know that we all
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:29.960]  affect that and the future isn't set but generally geopolitically domestically what is the map of
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:36.760]  the world tyranny versus liberty well there's a couple things happening at once obviously one is
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:42.440]  you know you know we've got economic problems in this country of course but the the thing that
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:49.880]  you know is uh when you look worldwide you see this is really a global crisis so all the economies
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:57.240]  are on the on the brink even even economies that you know have been thriving like in china uh
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:03.640]  you know all of a sudden the the parties come to an end here and you know in the past the united
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:11.080]  states has been kind of a hedge against the global uh economic collapse but now we're kind of at the
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:17.400]  forefront of it and so there's not going to be any place to go uh when when that hits and the and
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:23.640]  the dominoes pull and so that's one thing then of course you've got the uh the issues of you know
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:30.600]  i you know i i do believe that the uh the islamic threat is real i think uh the middle east is
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:36.120]  going to continue to be in in great turmoil what what many people in united states have called
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:41.960]  the arab spring is is really anything but a spring it's like a nuclear winter that we're
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:47.560]  we're headed into and that's going to be very destabilizing not only for the economy but you
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:55.000]  know um just a matter of uh self-preservation and so you know i think those are the two main
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.360]  things when you look at the world globally right now that are potentially disastrous for us uh
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:12.120]  wherever we live um and uh and and and it ties in i think alex to what we're seeing in terms of the
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.280]  creep toward authoritarianism here in the united states and and around the world why why now are
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:26.440]  we headed in this direction why are why are governments trying to you know get this iron
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:33.480]  fisted control over the people well i think it's because they know better than we do where we're
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:40.440]  headed toward this great economic collapse and i think that they see that as an absolute necessity
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.360]  when you know they're no longer able to send out social security checks and food stamps and so forth
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:53.160]  uh they they they realize that the only thing uh they're going to have their only response
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:37:00.840]  can be to use force to maintain some kind of order and and and let's quantify when we it is very
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:06.840]  scary let's quantify that why then try to disarm the general population when that's a hedge against
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:13.240]  letting things get out of control and uh undoubtedly if you look historically and economically
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:19.320]  the world is sliding into global depression there's no way i can see on with the current policies
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:25.720]  globally to get out of that so they intend to make lemonade out of lemons and use it to consolidate
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:30.760]  even greater power but but when we talk about a collapse what are some of those factors from your
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:36.120]  well research perspective and your whole research team of some of the top minds in the in the world
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:43.080]  in the world uh on finance like dr coursey where do where do they think it's going and what's the
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:49.320]  timeline well you know it seems like we're hanging on by our fingernails you know for instance people
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:55.560]  have pointed to to grief as kind of you know the canary in the coal mine when when grief goes it
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.680]  could set off but and but you know they keep propping up the canary in the coal mine the canary in
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:06.680]  the coal mine is on life support system and so therefore you know they think well that's the
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:13.480]  they're hedge against this this ultimate collapse that's bound to take place at some point in the
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:19.240]  future but when you look at it look what our economic policies in this country are unsustainable
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:25.240]  we know it's the same situation in europe they're they're slightly more advanced than we are but
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:32.040]  you know you look at the the american debt right now at seventeen trillion dollars and um uh and
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:38.280]  and you and you realize well you know if you just look at the number the the number of zeros
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:45.000]  and seventeen trillion it should be a wake-up call to everybody but you know uh too many of
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.920]  the american people just believe that somehow government's going to pull a rabbit out of a hat
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:58.200]  and and get us out of this this fix and there is no fix there's no fix for seventeen trillion
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:08.120]  dollars that's like um you know close to a hundred percent of the gdp in in the united states of
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:14.680]  america that's the debt and uh so how do you deal with that there there's no dealing with it the
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:19.720]  the only way you can deal with it is to say well we're not going to make it bigger anymore uh we're
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:27.640]  going to freeze it right where it is and there are probably only maybe 20 to 30 members of congress
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:34.840]  who feel that way today uh and that's why you know i started this red ink campaign no more
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:41.960]  red ink campaign to try to get people to pressure members of congress for this very logical
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.320]  step which is don't keep increasing the debt limit limit don't keep passing these continuing
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:54.440]  resolutions don't keep giving obama uh all the borrowed money he needs to you know build obama
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:00.440]  care and all the other crazy programs he wants to do we can stop sure well now he's sounding more
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:05.960]  dictatorial i saw him on the news last week go i'm not gonna allow people to block what i'm doing
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:12.360]  in congress and he just on every subject carbon taxes you name it just does whatever he wants
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:19.800]  i mean don't all the democrats and republicans get that this will collapse the culture and ruin
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:24.520]  their kids future if they don't turn back now because it's not debatable it's funny they all
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:30.280]  say it they all you know they all say it even obama says it even obama will tell you and you
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:35.320]  know you just have to go back a few years when he was in the u.s senate and he opposed raising the
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:40.040]  debt limit he said it was on his payroll back then he said we couldn't go on like this he's been
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:45.640]  saying he said it as a presidential candidate he has said it as president over two terms now
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:54.040]  but he keeps insisting that any even any talk of not raising the debt limit and continuing this
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:00.040]  this process what was it six six trillion or seven bush left now it's 18 trillion isn't it
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:06.600]  well we're adding about that since obama came in over one trillion a year so he this is about his
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:13.640]  50 year he's added about six trillion dollars in debt uh in five years yeah but then i've seen
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.360]  breakdowns that it's even more if you look at this is that's the help we're not even dealing with
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:23.320]  the the the clever accounting book you know bookkeeping tricks that they're doing for instance
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:30.840]  you know according to the treasury department the debt hasn't risen in like 80 days and the reason
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:37.400]  for that is they can't borrow money if they go over 17 trillion dollars so they keep borrowing it
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.320]  and insisting that they haven't borrowed any money sure sure but the real numbers i've seen
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.800]  is it's well over 18 trillion and that's what the and that's not even counting the unfunded
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.360]  mandates so let me understand this from your perspective shifting gears back to the middle east
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.800]  look what is the method to the obama controllers who are a lot of the same people that run the
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:04.440]  republican party to put al-qaeda in syria to turn libya over to the radical lohabist uh
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:11.320]  and and and then why why is israel uh it uh been uh been helping uh try to take a sod out because
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:16.280]  a sod was no longer offensively messing with anybody and then what do they think they're
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:22.200]  going to do once they put uh these radicals in control of syria i mean i guess just when they
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.120]  attack the west they'll just take their rights i guess that's the plan right i think there are two
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:32.680]  answers to that number one why why does america do this well i don't know why exactly i'm camp
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:38.760]  i'm not a hundred percent sure but it does put the lie to the fact to the idea the notion that
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.800]  these guys are really interested in fighting terrorism when they're when they're playing
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:51.400]  in power people they say attacked us you know namely al-qaeda so that doesn't make any sense
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:59.080]  but my my my guess is that it's part of some that you know uh globalist type uh conspiracies
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:04.360]  yeah geopolitical yeah now what about israel i think that's a more interesting question because
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:10.600]  you would think well isn't this sort of self-defeating why are they siding with not the bad guys but
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:16.360]  the really bad guys in syria you know and trying to overthrow a sod when a sod offers them some
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:24.440]  stability and i think the answer to that this is my guess uh it it's really bizarre but you know i
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:30.760]  think that what they're doing they believe they're number one enemy right now the most imminent threat
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:36.040]  they face existential threat you know what the threat they could put is iran so they want to take
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:42.360]  out iran's exactly and who is syria allied with who is a sod allied with he's allied with iran
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:49.560]  and so they'd rather deal with iran first and then basically have one enemy left which is the muslim
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.960]  brotherhood for all intents and purposes and they can deal with the muslim brotherhood
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:59.720]  on their own time schedule that's my guess well my larger issue is this everybody knows i'm not
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.600]  anti-israel but at the same time i'm not i try to stay out of this because i'm sick of it
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:11.320]  it's a political football like gay marriage you know potlaws any of this stuff it just it it just
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:18.520]  goes on and on but then people want you to like choose a side in this whole deal and the obsession
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:25.640]  by the anti-israel crowd uh constantly making stuff up that you know israel runs this is real
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:32.360]  runs that israel runs me this person you know general jones uh and the joint chiefs is jewish
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.480]  when they're not i mean i mean it really is a worldwide mental illness and and i don't get
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:42.680]  what the establishment with a lot of jews in it is doing promoting this agenda because i see the
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:49.000]  i see the left the really pushing an anti-semitic agenda and i don't what are they planning to
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.240]  get out of this i mean this is really like a religion i don't know but it reminds me of an
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:45:00.440]  old joke alec uh where where this guy mocha is sitting there and he's reading a nazi newspaper
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.360]  this jewish guy's reading a nazi newspaper his friend comes up to him says why are you reading a
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:10.360]  nazi newspaper he says well you know i used to read the the regular press but it was full of bad news
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:17.560]  the jews control the the control you know that uh you know how it's full of persecution of the jews
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.000]  and so forth now i read the nazi newspaper and it's all good news because the jews control the banks
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.240]  and the media and and everything so you you get the picture he was reading it because it was like
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:36.600]  a delusion of grandchildren exactly yeah you know i mean you're right the the anti-semitism and and
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.440]  really if you think about it you can go all the way back to you know hitler uh and what was hitler
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:48.040]  hitler was a socialist uh you know joseph stallin was a was a communist to look at you know how he
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:54.680]  persecuted the jews in the soviet union and and after stallin as well so where does the anti-semitism
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:02.440]  come from where does it emanate from in the modern world well it's perpetrated almost exclusively
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:09.400]  by socialists yeah but exactly but then it's also used as this football where everything becomes
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.800]  about that when the world is so much more complex like what about the communist chinese you know
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.600]  there's a billion plus people over there being used by communists delivers the world what about
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:24.200]  what about this issue what about it's like all people talk about from both sides is fighting
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:30.920]  with each other over this and it's really a party i don't want to be part of speaking of disinformation
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:35.720]  talk about that film a bit and then i want to get into have you seen the video of the head of the
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:42.120]  nsa being booed yesterday at the black cat conference uh they're a black cat hackers i heard the audio
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:47.640]  yeah i didn't see the video we're going to play that in a minute but but tell us about the film
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.680]  disinformation in the book well this isn't the book in movie disinformation it's really the
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.800]  movie is just adapted from the book and it's a series of terrific interviews with with people
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:03.960]  who are who are experts on what disinformation really is and we've all heard the term disinformation
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:11.800]  but it really is a made up word made up by the soviet union they recognize that you know lying
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:19.400]  to people is a very important strategy for maintaining power but this information is more
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.640]  than lies um it's one thing when somebody lies to you but it's another thing when a very credible
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:33.160]  source lies to you then it's that that's you know what the first lie is misinformation but the lie
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:43.000]  by a credible source is disinformation and um you know the soviet union uh had spent a massive
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.280]  amount of of its economy on perpetrating disinformation here in the west and this
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.880]  book in this movie uh chronicle that and the guy who wrote the book and the inspiration for the
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:03.720]  movie is named ian mahi pachepa who was the highest ranking soviet block defector to the west
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:09.880]  during the whole cold war he was in charge of romanian intelligence they had to take a daring
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:19.160]  escape route to get out of romania and come to the west he's been living under a new identity ever
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:26.760]  since constantly faced bill to visit a uh by death threats from romanians and and communists
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.720]  uh around the world by the way i've now basically taken over the eu bureaucracy
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:38.120]  exactly and imagine imagine yourself being this guy who comes here in the late 1970s
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:44.040]  to escape the freedom and to help the west understand what they're up against and to
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:51.640]  with communism and now seeing uh communism effectively taking over your new homeless
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.920]  well please help us get him on i want to play speaking of disinformation the nsa director who
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.640]  lied to congress and said we don't collect any data and had to admit two days later okay i lied
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:06.600]  and then now he lies to hackers that know full well what he said is pure bull here's a clip of
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:12.200]  that i want to get joseph's take on it stopping terrorism is one of the most important things
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:24.440]  exactly and with that when you think about it how do we do that because we stand for freedom
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:34.360]  not that but i think what you're saying
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:38.360]  is that in these cases
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:45.800]  what's the decision the heck was that rather the era and what tools should we have to stop those
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:53.080]  no i'm saying i don't trust you you lied to congress why would we believe you're not lying to us right
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:59.320]  now i haven't lied to congress what about i admitted he did congressional testimony
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:06.600]  wait for the question session thank you for that but if you disagree with what we're doing
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:17.880]  then you should help twice as much i have you should too i mean the arrogance of that and
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.440]  then he doubled back and said he did a lot of congress he admitted that okay that wasn't true
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:27.560]  right i mean this is unbelievable you know what struck me the first time i heard that it is this
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:34.360]  guy sounds like a hypnotist he's trying to put us to sleep with his speech well you know you
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:39.560]  weren't listening last hour were you i said that it's an npr voice i've talked to high-level npr
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.760]  people off record they tell them to do that on purpose to lull people into a trusting place i
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.080]  want to come back with with joseph and have you continue with what you're about to say
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:54.920]  that's why i like joseph farrah folks he gets it i mean that that that whole npr voice see
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:02.680]  i'm here like this trying to wake you up there they're going uh don't worry the obama administration

[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  used to always ask me about this and i went looked into it and there's other systems and
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:42.360]  whether it works or not they really are teaching npr people msnbc people government people and i've
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:49.160]  been to a 21 meetings they talk like this they go everything's fine it's like a cult or something
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:53.080]  it's how cult leaders talk you were starting to talk about that what's your take on this
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:56:03.320]  alex yes everything's going to be all right big brother is your friend turn in your guy
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:09.720]  well i thought they do this at msnbc whenever i turn on msnbc they're shouting at each other
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:15.080]  well i know some of the shows do that but then they have others where they do talk real like this
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:20.120]  no i mean i think i think there's something going on there i i don't know who's who's propagating
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:26.520]  this but it is it is npr like and and i think that most people who listen to npr are not really
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:33.000]  necessarily hearing the information that's being conveyed you know they're kind of being put into
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.320]  some kind of a trance well who are these guys on the classical channels where sometimes i'll
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:42.600]  listen to them and almost run off the road they're like and next we have a yohan bach piece and a
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:50.760]  minor by the such and such orchestra and i'm like uh i'm sorry you are the you are the personification
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:57.720]  of the opposite of all of that i have to hand you that now i've been told by some people sometimes
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.680]  it's like nails on a chalkboard but that's what america needs right i'm like the yosemite sam of
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:10.200]  talk radio oh i hate commies well you're the town crier and uh you know that that's we're in those
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:16.360]  kinds of times where we need people waking us up and and i commend you for for the great job you're
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:22.280]  doing absolutely sir we appreciate what you're doing i do you think overall obama is in deep
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.800]  trouble but i guess republicans won't try to impeach him yeah the he can only be in big trouble if
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:33.880]  there was a you know some organized opposition and the republican party is not organized opposition
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:40.200]  to the democratic party they're you know i mean at least the leadership of it isn't and uh you
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.360]  know i think they're about to hand him all kinds of victories they're not going to defund obama
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:49.400]  care even though they have the power to do that just in the house the representative has no support
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.040]  i mean take carl rove chris christy and others they spend more time attacking rand paul and
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:59.640]  libertarian types that are the future of liberty instead of going after obama right i'm glad you
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:05.000]  mentioned rand paul because i think there's some guys like rand paul he stands out in my mind but
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:11.640]  there are a few others who you know are they're in positions of power they're in the senate they're
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:19.160]  in the house and they are uh you know i think beginning to send out a different kind of message
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:24.200]  to people a message about liberty about self-government about all the things we believe in oh it's
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.520]  scaring the establishment that's how you know they're dangerous yeah i mean they're they're
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:34.920]  denounced by uh republicans and democrats alike uh but it doesn't do anything to to dampen
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:39.960]  this their support and i think that's great and i hope we have a president i hope so too joseph thank

[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:45.160]  good sir hey alex i'm a long time listener and um it's interesting when you say that uh all this
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:52.280]  news that we have it's so distracting us from the real things that are going on and at the last
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:59.800]  week you were saying that um we have a chance that humanity can beat this new world order and i
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:08.120]  disagree with that sir um humanity can't win i mean the anti christ and his one world government
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:14.520]  it's coming whether we like it or not and it's going to get so bad that jesus has to come back
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:22.840]  and go to war against them and and this is real sir this is so real and people need to understand
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:28.440]  that and every day i i just want you to bring that up i mean it doesn't have to be all three hours
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:35.880]  but please we have new listeners coming in every day i mean this is for people's soul and um i'm
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:40.120]  praying for you every day alex i appreciate what you're doing well let me just quantify this for
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:46.040]  a moment bill so stay there i'm going to go back to you in a second number one most people on the
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:51.080]  planet aren't christians maybe one out of five is a christian of some type and they're all fighting
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:55.480]  with each other over what the bible really says you know let's say out of two billion people are
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:11:04.200]  christians so maybe two out of two out of seven if you count seven billion people and around two
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:10.200]  billion say they're christians and most of christianity has just turned into a big country club
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:14.040]  deal and everybody's saying that other group's wrong and we're in the end club it's like a country
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:22.840]  club i'm just here to try to preserve basic dignity and and and human liberty and to not
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:30.280]  beat people over the headwood things and i see most of the churches i go to i don't care if they're
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:35.080]  baptist or methodist or if i go with one of my friends to hit you know before this catholic
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:41.080]  church it's the same thing uh well don't worry about anything because the world's about to end
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:50.600]  next month and for me it's the ultimate ultimate ultimate ultimate cop out let's say the antichrist
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.240]  is going to show up in 10 20 years i'm sick of always hearing it's going to be 1987 and 1992
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:00.360]  and 1999 these preachers you know saying it and just obsessing and this event in the middle east
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.440]  is this and this is that then they said same event over and over again and it's going to happen on
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.480]  this date no man know with that if you supposedly are a christian but these people will obsess over
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:17.080]  christ said don't obsess over that it's our job regardless to go out and to help people be aware
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:22.120]  of the tyranny that's happening and to help the innocence and the children they're going to abort
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:27.640]  and the orphans they're using and abusing and the and the and the gmo and the and the chemicals
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:32.280]  and the really bad stuff you know at the fast food places none of us are perfect but we're
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:37.800]  all trying to get towards something better our world's so poisoned it's it's it's hard to find
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:43.960]  anything it's quote perfect you know too much water is bad for you but it's about trying to be good
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:48.440]  it's not about saying i'm good i'm going to tell you how to be it's about hey i want to be good i
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:52.920]  want to build something better i want to be a better person because it's fulfilling that's
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:57.240]  what's satisfying people think they're going to become satisfied by being nasty and evil and
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:02.440]  manipulating people like i've been done wrong so i'm going to be bad to other people that is not
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:08.360]  the way it works that's why i have forgiven people that have lied about us and attacked us
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:13.720]  into horrible things because if they're just having a hard time and obviously dumbed down
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.880]  and twisted and you can see that with discernment that they're just having problems and they're not
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.240]  inherently evil then it's best to forgive them because hating them you know just gives into
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:27.800]  the whole thing and try to help them now if somebody's consciously evil and psychopathically
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:31.560]  manipulative they're the enemy and have to be dealt with but then i don't enjoy crushing them
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:36.440]  they've got to be you know done away with like you do you know a cat you're putting asleep as it has
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:43.160]  brain tumors uh but good people have to realize that we're not supposed to be wimps either and
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:48.440]  just walk around and you know that that's christlike because that's not actually who christ was it's
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:53.400]  the opposite the money changers the manipulators of society they're the real enemy they're the plague
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.920]  and christ beat them with a whip and overturned their tables we have to politically and psychologically
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:06.440]  do that and the bible says the beast will wage war on the saints and overcome them but through
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:12.840]  that you'll have the greatest awakening revival the world's ever seen the people have to be tested
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:20.200]  to show who they really are and you are not going to be raptured the bible does not say that until
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:24.440]  clearly after the antichrist has been tied by the archangel and thrown into the pit
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.000]  or i guess thrown into his cage for a thousand year display
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:36.440]  and so if anybody believed any of the bible whether you believe it's real or not what the
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:42.520]  churches are preaching is not there the dead in christ rise and then the living and the muslims
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:47.080]  interpret that that all everybody's just gonna die everybody's just when christ comes back everybody
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:50.920]  just dies like oh wonderful we're all you know they'll probably think when everybody's dying from
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:55.400]  bio weapons that the christ has come the christ has come hellbop hellbop i don't i think that's
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:59.800]  figurative there as well and people get really obsessed they don't care if we love justice and
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:06.600]  are against abortion we have to agree with their phara cynical can't dealing with what the bible
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:12.120]  really says and i reject all of it i just want to be a good person i want to stand up against evil
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.840]  i want to try to build people up i don't claim to be good here in two shoes quite frankly i am
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:23.160]  as i'm a wicked devil folks i'm a black devil you want to know who alex jones is i'm i'm i am a
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:32.280]  reprieved uh person try not to backslide and by devil i mean i can see and think all the things
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:39.080]  the new will order does i am inherently super wicked ladies and gentlemen but my good side is
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:43.640]  even bigger than that and that's what i choose and every day i get closer and more christ
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:49.560]  like by increments i'm still i mean a flaming devil ladies and gentlemen the real deal and
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.560]  that's how i know the enemy i can look right at them and see what they are i don't even run into
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:59.560]  many devils that are as evil as i am because if you've thought it you've done it folks and i can
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:04.840]  understand evil i know the mystery of good and evil like i just took a bite right out of that
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:09.560]  fruit okay i mean i got it and that's why i know who the enemy is i don't want any part of it
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:19.240]  it's really bad but just knowing it is a sin because to know it is to be in communion with it
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:25.640]  it's the knowledge of good and evil ladies and gentlemen the ancients before they fell
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:32.520]  had the knowledge of good and were innocent they you know that they they were aggressive
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:37.800]  they hunted they did whatever but they didn't have the knowledge of sin the technology the bible
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:44.440]  says in the end times the wicked will run about like like mad beast inventing new new sins new
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:50.200]  evils think of all there are new things under the sun being invented and
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:57.960]  that's where i stand on that i don't know the way gmo and everything's going
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:03.000]  the things described in revelation boy if the if it's in real they had a time machine
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:10.680]  you know insect looking craft dropping things out that make pillars of fire the size of mountains
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:18.680]  nuclear war plagues killing a third of the world service the ocean dying i mean it's it's it's
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:25.560]  even if you don't believe it the globalists have taken it as a model as a template so thank you bill
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:32.280]  i uh do you have any other comments to that uh that you'd like to talk about yes sir i do um
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:38.280]  i agree with everything you're saying um and just like you i seek the truth and everything both of
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:44.360]  my parents are pastors and i actually went to school i thought about going to seminary and i
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:51.400]  just want you helix to please question um why you call yourself a christian uh yeah there you go
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.920]  i know the only thing that satisfies you guys is talk look you're you're i understand it and i've
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.600]  got family that are baptists that are like this listen it's a Pharisee deal about how you've got
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:09.000]  to tell everybody about are you a good christian all day and and and mess with them so much they're
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.600]  going to go no i'm a devil worshiper i'm going to go party shut up and leave me alone you don't
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.880]  understand that and i appreciate your call i mean it is the religion is not impecking everyone
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:25.560]  you know the Pharisees came to christ and said you're with money changers you are with tax collectors
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:30.760]  you're with prostitutes you're with people that do unclean plumbing well you know what are you doing
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:35.960]  he goes well these are the people that'll listen to me you go up on your hill up there on the Sabbath
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:40.680]  and you'd pray in front of everybody in public and tell everybody how great you are we all know
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.720]  what's really going on and and i'm telling you it's a country club most christians i know have
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:50.440]  arrived at the most elite country club in the world and all they do is sit around reproving
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:56.440]  each other and talking about how great they all are and how good they all are just constantly and
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:02.360]  that is why everyone is running from christianity because what's being pushed is not christianity
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.400]  now i said i take a lot of calls that was an important call spent a lot of time on it but i'm
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:13.080]  done hey i already told you i'm as wicked as the day is long okay what i'm telling you is is that
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:19.480]  i see the good in you you have to see the good in me and it's not like some hallucination where
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.160]  everything's so evil you can't do anything but just like i see these christians they just shuffle
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:29.400]  around with their hands out they go like mpr slaves or something and they just shuffle around
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:34.120]  and worship their preacher and he's god well he's got you know mistress and you know all the stuff
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:39.480]  out the back it's just all a bunch of bull man i mean i just do not need to hear it anymore okay

[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:33.640]  what in the hell is a king wall i don't know are you really calling from idly
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:41.240]  i am i'm i am i appreciate your call dylan i'm having trouble with your audio understanding
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:45.640]  exactly what you're saying thank you ray in texas ray you're on the air go ahead
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:54.280]  hello yes sir yes sir shortly after world war two president harry s truman met with
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:26:00.120]  those soldiers who were held in the concentration camps of germany he was so moved by their
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:06.280]  statements that when soldiers in black uniforms showed up they knew bad things were going to
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:13.320]  happen he was so moved by that that he has congress to enact a federal civil right
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:19.320]  that and he signed it into law that those civilian force in black uniform may make
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:25.800]  or take a police action against the citizen in the united states so no u.s citizen should
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:32.360]  will ever be reminded of the atrocities committed against us forces and so no u.s citizen should
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:37.400]  ever feel they're being controlled by a totalitarian force sure sure you know i you know i'd actually
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:43.880]  read about that before what was the name of that uh what was the name of that law they tried to pass
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:49.080]  well he signed it in the federal law what was it i've only heard of it once before
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:55.800]  so no civilian should ever be reminded of the atrocities committed against us forces
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:02.200]  at the hands of the ss and so no well sure historically a black uniform is like the executioner
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.320]  too and every time about black you know every time i talk about black uniforms people say well why are you
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:11.320]  wearing a black shirt today well i guess because i'm a little bit overweight it makes me look smaller
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.720]  but no no i'm actually losing weight again so not too much but i probably a third of my shirts are
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:22.600]  black it's not bad if you're wearing a black shirt it's that when the police historically are wearing
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:29.080]  black uniforms whether it's mexico or nazi germany or soviet russia and soviet russia the secret police
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:34.200]  wore black uniforms and it's done to intimidate and and then when they were masked they've had
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:39.560]  police chiefs come out and admit they wear those to intimidate people go ahead yes sir
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:47.880]  and it's a federal civil right that no civilian force in black uniform may make or take a police
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:53.400]  action against the system united now sir what's the name of the law i want to look that up well
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:28:01.240]  well i have looked and looked i read it in a federal maranda rights handbook about in 2007

[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:06.200]  all right folks let me get some news i'm gonna go right back to your phone calls
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:15.320]  quinoa is a grain that you do have to cook under high temperatures to make it edible
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:25.880]  and it's a spanish grain and it was michael cantalano was looking for information online
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:31.800]  about pressure cookers or michelle her husband in the same time frame was googling backpacks for
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:37.000]  their children now wednesday morning six men from the joint terrorism task force showed up
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:43.480]  at their house to see if they were terrorist with big shields armored vehicle the combat
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:50.440]  outfits and of course they had the trendy little you know chick there to help with the children
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:55.640]  in case they needed to be taken uh which prompts the question how'd the government know what they
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:02.120]  were googling and it goes on to say they admitted basically that it's all runs of the nsa database
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:07.800]  and that just goes to what snowden was saying and folks they probably are going to do a few
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:13.160]  of these now to make you think they're using it to go after terrorists uh ladies and gentlemen
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.200]  it's used to steal economic data and be able to fix markets on record that's the main use
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:22.680]  to target political enemies to target the press to target whistleblowers that know about corruption
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:27.960]  i've told you that for over a decade with experts like the former producer of nightline james
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:34.360]  bamford the road body of secrets back in 2001 on it and account with others that we've had on i mean
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:41.480]  this is known this has been an eu commissions congressional commissions so when general
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:46.200]  alexander gets up there and says we don't record or save anything the congress is like excuse us
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:50.280]  because it's come out again today that congress funded it was all briefed and knows full well
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:55.240]  the crime they've committed just like last week they voted to continue warrantless spying just
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:59.960]  like a court ruled two days ago they can spy on you without a warrant now and they're like oh you
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:07.720]  didn't hear fourth amendment means we don't get a warrant you're like oh okay it's all part of just
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:19.240]  the complete over-the-top nature of all of this and it really really makes me want to throw up
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:26.280]  and they asked him why are you getting a pressure cooker why were you searching for pressure cooker
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:32.200]  and and he said well you know my wife got it to to cook
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:38.920]  and then the officer went on to say what in the hell that's what the caller was saying and how rude
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:45.880]  that is what in the hell is quinoa man i tell you i mean this is the type of stuff you deal
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:50.360]  with where a bunch of armed people show up knock down your door you come out with your kids and
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:54.440]  it's all part of the delusion that there's these terrorists everywhere the real al-qaeda terrorists
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.840]  were always run by our government which is a criminal offshore bank that of course wants to
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:06.200]  use the threat to take our liberty and it's totally disgusting the article from the atlantic wire
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:11.720]  is up on info wars dot com right now if you want to see it now let's shift gears into that area
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:18.040]  snowton rented one-year asylum in russia while they consider permanent asylum by the way russia
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:22.120]  spies on their people too it's come out that they've got snooper systems that grab all the cell
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.960]  phone data out of the air and track you that's because they're telecommunications companies
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:30.600]  don't have it put in at the site they just grab it out of the air the old-fashioned way here it's
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:36.120]  all wired directly in the telephone company is the nsa even small companies have blown the whistle
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.960]  going oh yeah they came in and made us and small companies don't have lobbyists so they don't get
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:45.960]  paid to put the grid in and make money they didn't write the law the little companies i'm talking 10
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:50.520]  15 employees this has come out they've got to put in say a hundred thousand dollars of equipment
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:54.360]  because the fed showed up and threatened them we need to be able to pick up everything your people
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:38:00.120]  are doing on their email servers hell yeah this is the type of stuff that goes on and then they get
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:06.760]  up in line go we're not listening to nothing you do oh let's continue here snowden's father
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:11.720]  calls out obama on nirenberg crimes a very powerful letter that went public yesterday
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:16.120]  curtain emma wrote about it it's up on info wars dot com pointing out he had a right and a duty to
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:23.640]  expose the crimes not just a right he had a duty to not be complicit in them absolutely and that's
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.040]  why they're worried about their own people not being part of this criminal takeover here's another
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:35.000]  one nsa spying directly harms internet companies silicon valley california and the future of the
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:42.200]  entire u.s economy money magazine points out well yeah because all that infrastructure costs
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:46.920]  billions and billions a year to put in it passed the cost on and then we can't be competitive with
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:51.960]  other countries that aren't the quote pivot you know of world data we're not the pivot we're the
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:57.800]  pivot of the of them spying it's so overdone the face scanning cameras the license plate reading
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:02.600]  systems all of it and then it goes into how it violates all these other laws and people don't
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:08.360]  want to do business here now because they know when you do something on anything hooked into the

[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:26.840]  saying it i have a question for you and um the thing that i have to say is i have a really new
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:35.400]  listener i've only been listening since maybe the end of june not very long and um no hold on um
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:45.160]  anyways what am i gonna say i'm the leader i'm sorry go ahead ma'am before i um started listening
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:52.520]  to you and found you on youtube i read a book and um this book is really cool um it's about this guy
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:48:00.280]  who had um a near-death experience and um he saw like some people call it the end of the world but
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:05.480]  like you know the end times basically like he saw well every culture they've got even mainline
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:10.600]  university studies it doesn't matter if you're an atheist or a hindu or a christian has the
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.240]  portal the angels that whole experience there have been people that have been dead you know
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.560]  10 minutes we've had on that i know personally who've come back and literally the guardian angel
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:24.120]  was there you're being sent back there's a reason every culture in history has those stories and
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.440]  even if you say it's something scientific what is it i mean we're on a planet in deep space look at
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:33.400]  all how wild stuff already is someone who's spiritual just knows that there's more out there
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:38.360]  that are limited five sense awareness can pick up and i feel sorry for those that haven't had
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:45.400]  experiences uh you name it that that let them know there's more than meets the eye
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:52.680]  what was interesting was um he had this near-death experience and he saw this all this stuff that's
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:49:01.800]  going on right well after i read this um some of the things that was he had mentioned um i started
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:06.840]  like seeing all this stuff on youtube and it like went hand in hand so for example like
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:12.680]  the foreign invasion like he talks about that how we're going to get invaded by foreigners and
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:17.880]  we're going to get to bed we're going to get invaded by helpers what is that well the news
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:23.720]  will there'll be helpers oh okay well anyways he's good it talks about the invasion of foreigners
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:28.440]  and then it talks about it's so crazy because um when i read the book i didn't really like
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:33.240]  i didn't really understand what it meant until i started finding out about chemtrails and i was
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:39.400]  like oh my gosh because like in the book it's talking about how there we're going to get poisoned
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:44.520]  and how um it's going to be a little microscopic white like flakes like you can't see them with
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:51.080]  your eyes but they're going to be vitamins sprayed by the helicopters right but when i read that i was
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:55.320]  just like okay well that's crazy but then when i started well look you're just going to go to sleep

[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:34.840]  solutions to the people and our whole idea is to go around the united states for six weeks
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:43.720]  we stop in every state every city we interview people um and no i know i saw your entry it's
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:50.360]  really good did it make them the final 200 or so cool cool i mean i mean did it i mean i mean

[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:06.440]  we're going to be cycling more of the films through the paul revere site in the next few

[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:25.080]  we live from lost in texas it's kind of not threatening blood on over here while i go to
[03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:32.200]  sleep never mind those fangs got to drink a little blood now yeah that was jan napolitano
[03:08:32.200 --> 03:08:36.760]  bringing us in now that she's not the head of my security she's doing voiceovers for us and i think
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:41.480]  we are going to do an animation margos morales one of our great graphics people he's really good at
[03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:47.800]  those little green antennas on this on the nsa director when he was like hello and they're like
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:55.640]  you know we want freedom you are getting freedom when we spy on you you lied to congress i did not
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:09:01.400]  lie maybe they're like robots or something i don't i'm being sarcastic but i mean it's just
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:08.040]  it's a cult of crooks uh amber calling from texas she wanted to talk about food additives
[03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:11.880]  yeah they have like silicones and the stuff they make chicken mcnuggets with and it just
[03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:17.320]  goes from bad to worse go ahead and get into your points ma'am yes it is basically the biggest lie
[03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:22.920]  we're told is that proteins and amino acids are good for us i mean some of them are but the worst
[03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:30.120]  chemicals that cause all brain damage are also amino acids and proteins that's just their chemical
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:35.080]  structure but they are sure they've been chemically manipulated like they can argue what's an aspartame
[03:09:35.080 --> 03:09:39.400]  is no big deal but it's the way the molecules been strung together it breaks down basically
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:45.000]  in a formaldehyde in your stomach everybody knows that makes you go blind right yes and
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:49.880]  formaldehyde actually amplifies what it does in your brain i mean it's whenever we have a stroke
[03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:55.000]  or a head injury the brain spits out amino acids that actually cause the damage and those are the
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:00.760]  same amino acids we're eating and the IQ the IQ's gone way down it's it's it's certainly no doubt
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:05.960]  yeah yeah it all causes brain damage and every single chronic disease is just a different type
[03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:10.840]  of brain damage according to what area of your brain was damaged so none of them are even really
[03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:16.360]  diseases they're just brain damage but why not be brain damage you just sit there in an easy chair
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:22.120]  listening to government people talking droning mind control hypnotism voices all right it makes
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:28.840]  it a lot easier to believe things when your brain isn't working and natural flavor is the worst one
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:34.360]  i mean just think about that ingredient what the heck is natural flavor it's not natural and it's
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:40.200]  not a flavor it just excites the crap out of your brain where you taste it can be whatever
[03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:45.400]  they want it to be and that's why generally you want to move to whatever's organic non-gmo
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:50.040]  whenever you can and help create that market absolutely what was the other points you wanted
[03:10:50.040 --> 03:10:54.200]  to get to ma'am and the other thing is those same chemicals are the same ones that are in
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:58.600]  vaccine so we're all looking for different chemicals but it's all the same oh next you're going to say
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:04.680]  vaccines aren't good for us yeah i know and i actually i have studies that i guarantee no one's
[03:11:04.680 --> 03:11:11.080]  ever seen because this is in information control at its finest i mean if you want to know medical
[03:11:11.080 --> 03:11:15.640]  facts you can't see them because they're in medical journals that only hospitals and universities
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:20.600]  get to see well a lot of those medical journals are online you got to pay for the full ones but
[03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:24.760]  but then people do do reports on those with subsections you should start a website or do a
[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:28.600]  youtube channel they may have already been doing that you know showing the stuff to people and you
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:32.680]  won't reach probably millions of people but you'll reach thousands and then if millions of people
[03:11:32.680 --> 03:11:36.920]  do what you're doing we'll reach hundreds of millions so i mean regardless i mean have you
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:43.160]  gotten this info out to the people uh i have to admit i'm a little weirded out because this is the
[03:11:43.160 --> 03:11:47.880]  exact proof that could take down pharmaceutical corporations in monsanto and i'm like i don't
[03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:51.960]  want to do well and actually this stuff yeah listen i appreciate your call ma'am uh you know

[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  millions of listeners we're having an effect but we're only one small part of it i need everybody
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:05.240]  else to go out there i mean if you know something's going on and you have medical journal stuff because
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:10.280]  it's all out there people are then afraid to go talk about it and show somebody might come after
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:15.480]  you they're already coming after us i mean if they're not i'm not mad at you it's just that
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:20.520]  it you know people want to call here like it's safe to say it here but you don't want to be public
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:23.960]  we need people to get in the game against the new world order but good to hear from you i appreciate
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:31.000]  your call uh let's talk to erin in washington you're on the air hi Alex how you doing today
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:36.760]  i'm doing all right there trooper yes um i'm not really calling from Seattle as it has on your
[03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:42.040]  list otherwise i'd be talking just like this i love these impersonations you do well no way
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:57.400]  it's not that it's not okay and the reason i'm calling uh like i told you guys uh i wanted to
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:04.360]  talk well mainly to your listeners about the beginning of our nation you know is kind of a
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:11.000]  there's two purposes for the foundation of our country as you know you know and it goes back to
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:18.600]  rosicrucianism and uh the masons you know wanting to spread democracy you know is the kind of their
[03:13:18.600 --> 03:13:25.400]  key you know it's the the occult uh secret or the occult promise right and it is so over the top
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:31.880]  because at their core doctrine it's luciferian and you know there's a lot of lower level
[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:37.800]  you know fraternity members that don't know this but you've got to understand just like an agent
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:42.280]  like all your agents you know they're listening to your show now you know there are high levels
[03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:47.000]  and they're just being used you know they're being used to work for someone else and like you said
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:52.120]  at the bottom of the rabbit hole or at the top of the pyramid it's that same evil spirit it's always
[03:13:52.120 --> 03:13:58.040]  been and well i mean to be specific we've we've sold the films about the new atlantis in america
[03:13:58.040 --> 03:14:05.080]  secret beginnings and frances bacon and the queen of england and there is all of that going on
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:09.000]  but then other things happen you know george washington spoke out against the illuminati
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:14.040]  he was a mason but he was a great guy and they had a real goal of freedom and empowering humanity
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:21.560]  and so it's really competing organizations even within what you'd call the masons you know people
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:27.320]  say all the masons are all evil well no but at the higher levels of it there are the secret adepts
[03:14:27.320 --> 03:14:32.360]  and basically an illuminati version or a mera vigen version where they do teach that you know
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:38.600]  basically jesus and lucifer are one two sides of the same coin uh but that's not really what the
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:45.080]  even more ancient masons taught there were a bunch of mystery schools of of farming and metallurgy
[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:51.480]  and architecture and you had to go through a bunch of initiations and be from the right family
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:56.760]  to even be in those and so the it was ancient times it was pre-christian so you also had a cultic
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:01.320]  stuff in there which just means hidden and so it means the hidden world you just don't give
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:05.720]  everybody the knowledge and the data what i'm doing is trying to reverse engineer all this
[03:15:06.360 --> 03:15:11.800]  and get people thinking about it to truly empower humanity so that they can't use secretness to only
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:16.120]  illuminate themselves because they were really illuminated they would want to empower everybody
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:21.560]  not just empower themselves to then dump everybody else down that's the opposite of illuminating
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:26.040]  so see they call themselves the illuminated ones the illuminati but really they're trying
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:32.280]  to bring darkness to the world you understand oh yeah absolutely and i mean uh you know it's all
[03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:36.840]  you know they're all falling for the same tricks as adam and eve fell for like the knowledge of
[03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:41.000]  good and evil right i i i told you understand what you're saying about you study into this and you
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:48.520]  start you know feeling that evil power and you know so anyways so my i guess i urge you know
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:53.320]  christian brothers and sisters to look into it you know but to look at how to fight it and don't
[03:15:53.320 --> 03:15:58.440]  just look and do all the bad things but uh you know look at the whole you know that's at the end of it
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:04.040]  all and you know continue to speak and you will find it i hear you erin good to hear from you
[03:16:04.040 --> 03:16:10.040]  i'm gonna try to get everybody in in this segment alan delaware you're on the air go ahead hi alex
[03:16:10.040 --> 03:16:17.080]  i've got intel here about uh oil reserves having peaked in 2005 usable oil reserves that we know
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:23.880]  of is easy low hanging fruit has peaked in 2005 the Saudis are panicking over fracking uh they
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:29.560]  have earthquakes we've got all kinds of methane gaps released uh we know that the planet is in a
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:35.480]  cooling uh where you're basically going back to the ice age because of the sun dimming what do
[03:16:35.480 --> 03:16:41.880]  you make on this and it's 2017 really uh the end of oil flows as we know it do you have anything on
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:47.400]  that well again this is incredibly complex oil is getting harder to get
[03:16:50.360 --> 03:16:52.920]  they are having to do more more expensive exploration
[03:16:55.640 --> 03:17:03.560]  but there's also the pro carbon tax people hyping artificial scarcity exaggerating but undoubtedly
[03:17:05.240 --> 03:17:10.040]  said i go on a thousand feet for oil they're going 15 000 feet for oil and there's a lot of big
[03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:14.840]  oil reserves that have been left alone that the globalists are trying to create an artificial
[03:17:14.840 --> 03:17:22.200]  scarcity in the north sea the stuff in alaska stuff all over and then letting wall caters go in or
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:26.520]  smaller companies that'll do the deep wells places like texas so they're trying to bring in regulations
[03:17:26.520 --> 03:17:34.200]  to shut that down that we got dilling poll on about a tomorrow 97 percent of the global warming con
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:38.680]  artists groups are fun about oil companies that's why they always say you work for the oil companies
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:42.120]  because really the oil companies want all the smaller things shut down
[03:17:42.840 --> 03:17:48.360]  i guess big oil companies are actually funding the anti fracking films so see if there's different
[03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:53.720]  groups big oil wants coal shut down because you could make gasoline out of that or or type of
[03:17:53.720 --> 03:17:59.320]  fuel more like diesel uh so we look we've got a lot of energy we are using a lot of it as well
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:05.480]  i'd like to move on to other energies but they're suppressing those creating a counterfeit
[03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:10.680]  alternative energy system that's unsustainable and only gives money to their friends
[03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:18.600]  so real progress is being held back by these oligopolies go ahead and natural gas is not
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:23.080]  going to work in automobiles because it turns your car into a ticking time bomb they don't
[03:18:23.080 --> 03:18:28.120]  have any solutions whatsoever all the intel that i'm getting is coming from the congressional
[03:18:28.120 --> 03:18:35.480]  hearings that are being well i mean you say congressional hearings that are being suppressed um
[03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:43.480]  what i'm saying sir is that there's giant oil reserves they have it tapped and huge government
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:48.840]  reserves around the world saudi arabia has peaked in its oil production but russia is just going
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:53.480]  into its areas they haven't drilled in half their country it's just full of oil there's oil pretty
[03:18:53.480 --> 03:18:58.920]  much anywhere you drill in areas of russia uh so what i'm saying is that they're creating an
[03:18:58.920 --> 03:19:05.400]  artificial scarcity to consolidate power right now and trying to shut down other energy reserves
[03:19:06.520 --> 03:19:11.640]  you know about fuel they can create out of uh out of coal right that can be running cars you know
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:18.200]  about that i heard that they're spraying coal with diesel fuel so that they can get these tax
[03:19:18.200 --> 03:19:25.000]  breaks from the government or in what's called uh this uh um uh fake fuel what do you call it fake
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  fuel well listen i'll say this everybody that wants to come out pick oil it's going to happen
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:33.320]  because they're going to cut it off i mean there are it's the oil companies that that run the green
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:37.800]  movement and they're going to they've got you captured we are on an oil based system they
[03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:42.920]  won't let us get out of it i don't particularly like it so you understand the people saying get
[03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:48.040]  off oil are the ones that are when they say get off oil they mean they're gonna charge you so much
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:51.800]  for it you're going to live in a 200 square foot apartment i don't know how to explain it to people
[03:19:51.800 --> 03:19:55.400]  i'm trying to explain it they're going to put taxes on petroleum based plastics
[03:19:55.400 --> 03:20:18.200]  god bless you all back tonight seven o'clock central info wars nightly news
