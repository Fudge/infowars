[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  You want answers?
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:14.000 --> 00:34.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  Well, this is going to be an extremely fast moving Tuesday, the 30th day of September, 2014.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  Dr. Ron Paul, former congressman, will be joining us to cover the waterfront.
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  From ISIS being backed by the West to the 28, 9-11 pages that clearly show our government stood down bare minimum
[01:00.000 --> 01:10.000]  to his son, Ron Paul, the GOP frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2016.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  That and a lot more is coming up.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura will shift gears out of the lawsuit he won
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  and get into geopolitical issues, domestic issues, immigration issues,
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  and take your phone calls coming up in the third hour.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  And I've got Dr. Ed Group joining us to talk about very serious developments on the Ebola front at the bottom of the hour.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us.
[01:34.000 --> 01:42.000]  North Texas Hospital evaluating patient for potential Ebola exposure, CBS Local, out of DFW.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  There's another headline out of nine news in Dallas.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  Dallas Hospital isolates possible Ebola patient.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  Ebola outbreak, thousands of orphans shunned, BBC.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  Ebola's trick and line barriers are sending an economic hell.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  The Washington Post, five reasons why we may never know Ebola's true impact.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  That's out of time magazine. We're going to break it down. And then, of course, this article up at infowars.com.
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  I'm Max Flavo.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  Ebola Alert, US Patient Zero, suspected in Dallas.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Travel history and symptoms suggest infection.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  That's coming up right after the break.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  We're going to get into that first.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  Continuing.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  New documents show legal basis for NSA surveillance program.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  The NSA made its own documents.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  Kind of like a get out of jail free card you make up on your home computer and put in your wallet.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  And they say that's how they spy on everyone illegally without warrants and why they lied to us.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  Gee, they're being honest. They promise. I mean, it's okay.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  They had a note, even though they forged it. It wasn't from the doctor or from mommy.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  It was from Bathomet. So we're going to be breaking that down.
[02:54.000 --> 03:04.000]  Also, you know that we don't criticize police themselves individually and demonize police for what other bad police do.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  That only feeds into the us against them paradigm, the divide and conquer balkanization that the globalists want.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  We are against federalization of the police. We are against them violating the Bill of Rights of Constitution.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  But the police are a reflection of the government.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  And you know what rolls downhill. So just demonizing them doesn't do anything plays into the larger plan.
[03:28.000 --> 03:40.000]  But we do have to show what federal training and federal directives have turned the police into what we fear in Mexico, what we fear in Nigeria, what we fear in North Korea.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  These are mainstream news articles I have, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  I'm going to shoot him in the bleepest in the male genitals says cop before executing camper.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  They pull up and say, we're going to kill him. And the other police go, you mean non lethal.
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  And the guy starts giggling. Of course, even after he's been shot repeatedly on the ground, they keep shooting.
[04:06.000 --> 04:14.000]  Let the dog bite him. It's an example of the stuff you see with gang members attacking an old lady or something.
[04:14.000 --> 04:22.000]  The very same giggling, the jibbering, the, I don't like hardcore convicts that are abusers of innocence.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  I don't like gang members. Thug types will try to intimidate you at the gas station.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  I'm not looking for trouble, but I just start really getting ready to go crazy, you know, clobber.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  And it's, I get the same feeling when I see a group of thug cops. Most cops don't act like that, but you can see it when you've got a group of gangbanger cops.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  It's like the gangbangers have infiltrated the military. And it is disgusting. And that's what they are.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  They're gangbangers with badges. And there's, there's nothing I think more disgusting.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  And then it goes on. Florida woman arrested for possession of spaghettios. Can't make that up.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  Cop sees his car when told to get a warrant. Tells owner that what he gets for exercising his rights.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.000]  At the same time, the restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and two together?
[05:10.000 --> 05:18.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[05:18.000 --> 05:26.000]  But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  DNA Force.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  Open your eyes. It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[06:05.000 --> 06:12.000]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[06:12.000 --> 06:20.000]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  Open your eyes. Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts, and more.

[07:43.000 --> 08:12.000]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[08:12.000 --> 08:38.000]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[08:38.000 --> 08:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Tuesday, the 30th day of September 2014.
[08:48.000 --> 09:01.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. Paul Watson just posted an article to infowars.com that I'm going to pull up right now.
[09:01.000 --> 09:19.000]  That is huge, huge news. CDC warns funeral homes in U.S. to prepare for Ebola victims, recommends caution workers not to embalm corpses.
[09:19.000 --> 09:42.000]  This ties into an article that we put out four years ago when we received secret documents out of Indiana that confirmed them in New York state as well as Texas and Arizona that they are preparing for millions dead per popular state like Illinois and Texas and Indiana and New York, hundreds of thousands in states like New Mexico and others.
[09:42.000 --> 10:00.000]  I have asked Watson, who just showed me the article five minutes ago before it went live, to add the old article about the larger preparations during an airborne Ebola release or mouse pox or something along those lines.
[10:00.000 --> 10:20.000]  Now, they have brought more than 15 Ebola patients to the United States. That's never been done before. They're now estimating at the U.N. 1.4 million people will have it by December. Some top German virologist in Build magazine were quoted three weeks ago as saying 5 million, 5 million.
[10:20.000 --> 10:38.000]  Now, I don't know if any of this is going to be that bad, but this is not infowars.com saying this. We were covering it months ago saying it could be projected out to that point, but it's getting serious because they could use the fear to roll out this Monsanto,
[10:38.000 --> 10:53.000]  Billa Melinda Gates vaccine and heaven knows what will be in that. My grandmother got the polio vaccine and a month later got paralyzed and almost had to be put an iron lung and about half her muscles, the nerves got eaten, got killed.
[10:53.000 --> 11:10.000]  And she's 89 years old today on crutches and in a wheelchair. 1955, she was as happy as pie and beautiful and had two children and was, you know, married to my grandfather.
[11:10.000 --> 11:25.000]  And she went out and got that vaccine and she got it. And by the way, it was a scandal then how many people got polio from it. They were just hyping it up and it wasn't that big of an issue until the vaccine came in. And it was a victory of propaganda that they could do that.
[11:25.000 --> 11:41.000]  And still in India, in Pakistan, every couple of weeks you hear about 500 kids, 1,000 kids, 64,000 children in the last year. These are real headlines. Have paralysis after polio vaccine. They don't call it polio. They just, it's the same thing.
[11:41.000 --> 11:59.000]  Something eats your nerves and a lot of kids die and it's just a number. Oh, 63, 64,000. 64,000. Big deal. Oh, there was some more kids just died in Columbia last week getting vaccines. They were getting the HPV Gardasil.
[11:59.000 --> 12:14.000]  Oh, there's more dead kids in Afghanistan. The UN came out yesterday and admitted what the Telegraph said two weeks ago. Yeah, you know what? It's true. We had a vaccine mix up to kill a bunch of kids 15 and one town alone.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  And you know, they always under report, but it's just like a big deal. That's just part of getting your shots as you die.
[12:21.000 --> 12:34.000]  And they go, what are you against science? You get shots? I don't trust this world government caught doing countless secret tests on everybody and their mother doing this kind of stuff. I mean, you'd be crazy too.
[12:34.000 --> 12:55.000]  Our government kept shooting black people up with live syphilis and then not giving them treatment and watching their excruciating deaths as they spread it through the black and white population for 47 years, 47 years.
[12:55.000 --> 13:08.000]  And they oversaw Lyme's disease that is tick-borne syphilis that was produced at Plum Island. Look that up. You can't make this stuff up. And I'm just giving you well-known stuff that everybody knows.
[13:08.000 --> 13:24.000]  I'm not mentioning the literal hundreds of other admitted domestic tests that I could rattle off right now. Hundreds of them, hundreds, thousands of total studies, hundreds that were lethal.
[13:24.000 --> 13:39.000]  And giving the pregnant wives of GIs from 1943 until the 80s when they, quote, quit the program, vitamin bottles, mislabeled vitamins that were uranium and plutonium pills so they could, quote, see what it did to them.
[13:39.000 --> 13:51.000]  They weren't seeing what it did to them. It was a human sacrifice of the baby, a power of the state to corrupt the medical corps and to see how far they could go.
[13:51.000 --> 14:03.000]  It was a corruption. It was a twisting. So that's why this Ebola is so serious is because we can't trust the people involved over seeing it.
[14:03.000 --> 14:11.000]  What are they doing putting thousands of U.S. troops and others into the Ebola hot zones? You would never do that.
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  What are they doing letting them come back? What are they doing bringing more than 15 of these patients into the U.S.? What are they doing?
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  Look at this headline. Just went up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. We're tweeting it right now at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[14:24.000 --> 14:33.000]  CDC warns funeral homes in U.S. to prepare for Ebola victims. This is breaking at infowars.com.
[14:33.000 --> 14:45.000]  The Centers for Disease Control is advising funeral homes in the United States on how to handle the remains of Ebola victims, although officials are keen to stress the development is not cause for alarm.
[14:45.000 --> 14:58.000]  All three pages list of recommendations instructs funeral workers to wear protective gear while handling Ebola victims as well as warning them not to carry out autopsies are in bomb corpses.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  You think they need to be told? Don't touch it. I guess they probably do.
[15:01.000 --> 15:09.000]  If the outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in West Africa, why are funeral homes in America being given guidelines?
[15:09.000 --> 15:23.000]  Ask WFSB. Last night it was revealed that the Dallas hospital is holding a potential Ebola victim in stringent isolation after the patient was admitted based on symptoms and recent travel history.
[15:23.000 --> 15:33.000]  Alicia English, executive director of the Georgia Funeral Directors Association, dismissed suggestions that Americans should be alarmed by the recommendations.
[15:33.000 --> 15:45.000]  Again, you asked Watson to print me, because I can't do it on air, print me the Aaron Dykes article from four or five years ago with the actual documents about funeral cemeteries prepared for mass graves.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  I think it was the headline. I just need that intel. We can put it on screen. Thank you. I want to have it added to this article.
[15:51.000 --> 16:04.000]  As reported earlier this month, the U.S. State Department ordered 160,000 Ebola hazmat suits, prompting concerns that officials were preparing for an outbreak within the United States.
[16:04.000 --> 16:10.000]  While Ebola has so far been confined to the continent of Africa, speculation has arisen that the virus could have gone airborne to at least unlimited extent.
[16:10.000 --> 16:25.000]  Michael T. Ulsterholm, director of the Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, acknowledged in recent New York Times op-ed that virologists are loath to discuss openly, but are definitely considering in private the possibility that Ebola has gone airborne.
[16:25.000 --> 16:42.000]  Top German virologist Jonas Schmidt, caused consternation recently when he suggested that the battle against Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia was lost and that the virus would eventually kill five million people.
[16:42.000 --> 16:56.000]  Here is the article from 2009 by Aaron Dykes. Plans for mass graves confirmed. Government serving cemetery readiness for mass flu outbreak or other deadly contingent.
[16:56.000 --> 17:05.000]  And the actual documents are there, preparing for millions to be buried in just one cemetery in Indiana and New York state.
[17:05.000 --> 17:14.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, plans for mass graves confirmed. We can scroll down and show folks the documents right there in the article.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  This is the reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  Okay, because when we reported the mass grave plan, they had all this national media say we were putting on a hoax.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  They had all the national media say we were lying. We don't put out hoaxes.
[17:29.000 --> 17:39.000]  Probably every six months or so, one of my great writers, and I've done this myself before, will pick up somebody else's report that is a hoax or wrong.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  Because we're posting a lot of news and get it wrong.
[17:41.000 --> 17:49.000]  A couple of weeks ago that happened. It hadn't happened in about a year or two that Watson had made a mistake.
[17:49.000 --> 17:55.000]  And he did one about sex education in Florida from another source that was not accurate. It was actually Canada.
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  But that stuff goes on in schools regardless. But the Washington Post wrote about how we were deliberately putting out bull last week.
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.000]  Even though I saw it five minutes after it went up, it had a gut reaction. I couldn't get ahold of Watson.
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  So I called another web guy. I got the codes and I'm good at it. I said, jerk that story.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  And then I got Watson on the phone. I'm not throwing him in the bus. This happens to me too.
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  This is an example of total transparency here. And I said, I think that's fake. I think those people look too old.
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  And he goes, all right. And then Washington Post hit us. But here's the thing.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  They were watching within about 10 minutes. We had that pull down 5, 15, I don't know, 5, 10 minutes, whatever.
[18:31.000 --> 18:38.000]  Had like five comments when I found it. When I looked at it. And they had already seen it and already screenshotted it.
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.000]  That's how much they're watching us just waiting for us to make a bumble.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  But I'm glad I should probably even retract that on air because that's why I didn't actually talk about that.
[18:47.000 --> 18:54.000]  That was on purpose to tell that story because we don't celebrate our mistakes, but we open them up.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  We want you to know when we make a mistake because we're here trying to get it right.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  It's like yesterday I said, show teleprompter here. I'm going off memory and research.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  I said, yeah, this monster that cut these ladies head off, tried to kill the other one.
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  Got stopped by the CEO of the company, Oklahoma. You know, I'm glad he took that guy out. I'm glad he killed him.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  Well, I knew full well he wounded him. I don't know why I said kill him. It's a Freudian slip. I wish he was dead.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  And CJ popped my ear and said, he's not dead. And then they threw up an article right there in front of me.
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  That's good. That's what we all need to do with politicians, with media, with everybody else.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  I've told my whole crew, you call me on bull. You call me when something's wrong.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  You call me when you think something's out of bounds because I don't want to sit up here and compartmentalize,
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  smoke and moan, dope, believing I've got all the answers like the establishment does.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  Let me tell you, establishment, you don't have all the answers. This world is in crisis.
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  And when a ball of brakes out of it does in this country, we need to blame the system that didn't put the standard provisions in to stop it.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  They turned off the default protection modes.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  The human body is extraordinary. Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[20:07.000 --> 20:12.000]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon hardened body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[24:21.000 --> 24:43.000]  Lundy through Friday from 11am to 2pm central. We're here. This Ebola thing has been allowed to get out of control.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  It appears to be mutated in a stronger fashion. That's what the virologists are saying.
[24:48.000 --> 24:59.000]  I'm not going to recap all that. The fact that they are letting people fly into here from Liberia and other countries that are in a state of collapse right now.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  It's not even the Ebola deaths, which are terrible. That are the real crisis. It's the fear, the panic.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  And I'll tell you this. If Ebola breaks out in the United States, I'm going to quarantine myself.
[25:14.000 --> 25:24.000]  I'm wearing a mask. I've already got it in place for my family. And I'm just going to stay away from people that are infected and stay healthy. That's all you got to do.
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  But our government could pull all sorts of shenanigans to let this be the crisis that let Obama stay in office.
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  I mean, I never used to think that would actually happen. But the sky's the limit now. They've gotten away with executive orders on everything.
[25:37.000 --> 25:47.000]  And just launching wars without approval and carbon taxes without approval. So the sky's the limit at this point. I would expect anything out of these people.
[25:47.000 --> 25:56.000]  We're going to talk to Dr. Group coming up in the next segment about that. Later in the broadcast, after Ron Paul leaves us at the bottom of the next hour,
[25:56.000 --> 26:06.000]  I'm going to get into three articles from the stack today. And there's more than just these three. It is not my job and not my goal to just get up here and bash police.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  When I was younger, I did do that to a certain extent because I knew that North Korea and Mexico in places were oppressive and bad.
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.000]  I didn't want our police to be like that. I knew they were being federalized. I knew they were being militarized. But that's happened now.
[26:19.000 --> 26:29.000]  But you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar, as Grandma would say. And the police, as I've said a thousand times, is true.
[26:29.000 --> 26:38.000]  I didn't realize when I was young and dumb, still I guess young and dumb to a certain extent, at 40 years old, are a natural ally of the Liberty Movement.
[26:38.000 --> 26:47.000]  In polls, it's like 95% are pro-gun. Some are 98% national polls. They tend to be pro-property rights, actually anti-police state in many cases.
[26:47.000 --> 26:54.000]  The police state is what the feds are bringing down, what the globalists are bringing down from the top. They want to federalize local police.
[26:54.000 --> 27:04.000]  They give them the training, the militarization, the asset forfeiture, and then sit back with CNN and MSNBC and everybody and go,
[27:04.000 --> 27:16.000]  oh, look how horrible the police are after they literally are trying to twist them with their arm behind their back and to try to hire thugs and hire low IQ and hire gang bangers.
[27:16.000 --> 27:29.000]  Like they hire the droogies in Clarkwork Orange, the Stanley Kubrick film based on the book, Clarkwork Orange, that if you watch it today, you see how visionary it was, where they hire the gang members to be the cops.
[27:29.000 --> 27:41.000]  That's what's done in oppressive countries. That's what the Nazis did, is they hired the street thugs, hundreds of thousands of them, and veterans, bad veterans, to form the SA.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  But mainly just criminals and street thugs. And that's what I'm seeing in more and more of these videos from their own squad cars.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  I'm going to shoot him right in the bleeper, says cop, and this is on the news, we can say it, but I'll let the report say it, cop says cop before executing camper.
[27:57.000 --> 28:09.000]  And it's just some homeless guy, and even after they shoot him over and over again with real bullets, but also with bean bags and stuff, they go up and shooting more and they let the dog bite him and get off on it.
[28:09.000 --> 28:18.000]  And I said this was cold blooded murder on purpose. This is what you see in videos or testimony where six or seven gang bangers beat up and kill an old woman.
[28:18.000 --> 28:28.000]  It's the same giggling, the same, whether it's weirdo convicts or gang bangers or gang banger cops, they all look and act the same, everybody knows it, and I want to throw up.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  Let's play part of this newscast where they giggle and laugh about it before they execute the unarmed man. Here it is.
[28:34.000 --> 28:42.000]  Investigator Chris Ramirez has a video that APD didn't know he had. You're going to hear it for yourself and you decide what it means.
[28:42.000 --> 28:50.000]  And Tom and Tessa, the two officers who shot and killed homeless camper James Boyd, a Dominic Perez and Keith Sandy.
[28:50.000 --> 29:00.000]  Well, this story is about Keith Sandy. Nobody in the public has heard what Sandy said two hours before he pulled that trigger firing those fatal shots.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  Well, you're about to hear officer Sandy's own words.
[29:04.000 --> 29:13.000]  Keith Sandy, fired from New Mexico State Police, but hired by APD anyway, responded to the scene in the foothills last March.
[29:13.000 --> 29:28.000]  He sees an old colleague, State Police Officer Chris Ware. Sandy doesn't realize it, but where's dash cam is rolling, picking up this conversation that will change how lawyers, judges and our community view this shooting.
[29:28.000 --> 29:44.000]  We'll be right back, folks. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones. We'll be right back. Dr. Group's coming up. We'll play all this later.
[29:44.000 --> 29:49.000]  There's a couple more cases today. We're going to be covering just like it.
[29:49.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:06.000]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[30:09.000 --> 30:19.000]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day? If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[30:27.000 --> 30:36.000]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water, water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[30:39.000 --> 30:46.000]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[30:46.000 --> 31:00.000]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency. Go to infowarstore.com today to purchase your Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 Water Filtration System or call 1-88-253-3139.
[31:00.000 --> 31:09.000]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[31:09.000 --> 31:15.000]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[31:15.000 --> 31:19.000]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  Survival Shield X2.
[31:21.000 --> 31:34.000]  Leading the way into the next generation of super-high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus-million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[31:34.000 --> 31:42.000]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[31:42.000 --> 32:00.000]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation. Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at infowarslife.com, infowarstore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[32:12.000 --> 32:19.000]  If not, then I want to know why. Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people. They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  They're so populist. I say, so what? There's a battle going on out there right now. The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.000]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[32:31.000 --> 32:37.000]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[32:37.000 --> 32:47.000]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything. The info war is worldwide. Tell your friends about info wars, and let them know that info wars doesn't print bull.
[32:47.000 --> 33:11.000]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact. Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, and planetinfowars.com. The truth will set them free.
[33:17.000 --> 33:29.000]  For a long time, run over for a long time. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[33:29.000 --> 33:42.000]  Go tell that long tongue liar. Go and tell that midnight writer. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter. Tell him it's gonna, got him down.
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  So Congressman Dr. Ron Paul is going to be joining us coming up the start of the next hour.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  Then I will continue with this news. I'm going to shoot him right in the bleeper.
[33:53.000 --> 34:07.000]  He says cop before executing camper dash cam of state police captures officers premeditated intentions to shoot the homeless man.
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.000]  And they did indeed do that. Then let the dog after he was already dead, bite him and have a little bit of enjoyment.
[34:12.000 --> 34:19.000]  Another one. Florida woman arrested for possession of spaghettios. They said the spaghettios look like methamphetamine.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  Cop sees car when told to get a warrant. Tell owner that that's what he gets for exercising his rights.
[34:27.000 --> 34:38.000]  Close quote. That's on the dash cam. You need a warrant to search my car. Okay, I'm just going to seize your car.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  Of course, no drugs were found. Nothing. Of course, who ships the drugs in.
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.000]  Another one. Pennsylvania cop sued for storming home and arresting woman for video recording them out of her own home in the street.
[34:49.000 --> 34:59.000]  I mean, this is the craziness. And the reason police have been told to do this and act like this is because the power structure wants to convert us to a police state,
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  wants to convert us to a total totalitarian program.
[35:04.000 --> 35:13.000]  The inventor of the Internet. No, not Al Gore. The real British inventor has gone public worldwide and says we're going into a planetary tyranny.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  He used those words. You can look it up. William Benning used the words total totalitarianism, big brother 1984 on steroids.
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  He comes on the show now three times for what he's been on with David Knight twice. So five times.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  And it just sounds like me. He's the former director of intelligence at the NSA number three or number four, a director of the NSA.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  And he sounds more hardcore than me. And then I break down how I think it's really all working and operating.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  I don't want to sound arrogant. I know how it works. And he goes, yes, exactly, precisely, exactly, precisely.
[35:48.000 --> 35:56.000]  I have former CIA commanders on. They go, yes, exactly, precisely, because I'm not bragging. I'm saying we're just confirming our intel,
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  our analysis is spot on because all I've done is sit here and study this for a very long time.
[36:02.000 --> 36:13.000]  Believe me, anybody, if they immerse themselves for 22 years, 20 years on air, six, seven days a week, anybody does what I've done,
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  who isn't mentally retarded and you'll be an expert on all this stuff. That's why they're scared.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  See, it seems like we're so far behind down the rat hole in tyranny that we can never come back.
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.000]  That's not how it works. It flips, folks. Once you get a certain amount of weight, it's boom, because it's so obvious.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  It's over the top that they have that on us that it's over the top until it flips. Then that's against them.
[36:36.000 --> 36:43.000]  You see what I'm saying? It's like a judo move. They go over the top so we can't believe it's happening.
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  But if we ever wake up, the bigger they are, the harder they fall is kind of the analogy.
[36:49.000 --> 36:56.000]  And if people ever wake up out of their trance, they're going to be fully awake.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  It's kind of like, have you ever been halfway going to sleep and then you, somebody can't wake you up
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  as you were trying to go to sleep? But then if you've been in a deep dream, you can pop out of it fully awake?
[37:06.000 --> 37:14.000]  It's kind of like that. We're in such a deep dream, historically, this has happened before, that if we come out of it, it's, whoa!
[37:14.000 --> 37:21.000]  I'm in the matrix. This is incredible. That's the point we're reaching. And that's why the establishment is so desperate going,
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  okay, Mercury's good for your brain. Okay, your kids don't belong to you. Two plus two equals five or seven or whatever we say.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  And the world government's good, but it doesn't exist. They're trying to just get you used to now all the craziness.
[37:33.000 --> 37:43.000]  They're trying to acclimate you. It's psychological warfare. But if you're aware of the psychological warfare, it's game over.
[37:43.000 --> 37:51.000]  So their attempt to train the military to confiscate our guns and round up Liberty lovers and set up Brigade's homeland under Northcom,
[37:51.000 --> 37:59.000]  in the last six years, it accelerated under Obama undoubtedly. What do you think took the military from 50% awake to 90% awake?
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  And I've had Colonel Schaefer countless others that they go, that's the number, 90 plus percent. I'm not just saying that.
[38:05.000 --> 38:15.000]  What took them from 50% awake to 90% being called into briefing rooms and trying to take guns and told George Washington's bad?
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  It's the over the topness of it. But what are they going to do? They're going to take down America. I'm getting chills right now.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  I really am getting chills right now. It's just so epic what we're in the middle of and we just wake up to it. It's incredible.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  It's incredible that we could meet them. We could turn the tide. It doesn't mean we'll be in a utopia.
[38:32.000 --> 38:39.000]  It doesn't mean everything will be perfect, but we could stop a real offensive to really bring in hardcore tyranny.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  But let me tell you, the reason I get chills is, I don't want to say I'm scared because I'm not. It's the opposite, but it's like fear.
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.000]  It's braced. Like when you know you're about to get in a fight with a really mean guy and you're not scared, you're just getting ready.
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  It's an electricity. Because I realize, folks, I'm deader to boxer rocks if we don't turn this around.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  And your pension funds, your future is gone, too. I mean, it's so real, it's for everything.
[39:05.000 --> 39:13.000]  That's why I see men getting all psyched up about a Super Bowl game and they've got their tickets going in and they've got that same male energy that's meant to defend their family and their country.
[39:13.000 --> 39:20.000]  And they're, hmm, my team's going to win. That tribal energy is for what's happening now for real enemies, folks.
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.000]  So for me, it's like I'm playing in the Super Bowl every single day.
[39:28.000 --> 39:40.000]  It's like I, and then I don't feel adequate. I don't feel like I'm worthy because it's so epic that that's why I say, please don't tell me I'm doing a good job.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  And I don't want to talk about myself either. It's just that I think the way to wake people up is to have that personal experience and just share with you what I've gone through.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  I didn't believe a lot of this stuff 20 years ago. I was like a mainline Republican.
[39:52.000 --> 40:00.000]  And then I was a libertarian and I was like, I just, it's all real. So I'm radical because the truth is radical.
[40:00.000 --> 40:10.000]  And so they've miscalculated. If 50% of the cops were awake probably 10 years ago, now it's like 65, 70.
[40:10.000 --> 40:19.000]  It's like a conservative number because they're now seeing it's all real and they can feel it's bad. They know it's not good. They know it's not freedom.
[40:19.000 --> 40:26.000]  And they see bad guys being brought in and put in charge. They see corruption being allowed to operate. They see it. They're creeped out by it.
[40:26.000 --> 40:33.000]  They just are alone like we are. They don't know what to do. They've destroyed our culture of freedom. They've atomized this.
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.000]  I'm going to go to Dr. Group on Ebola. I'm ranting, but Dr. Group, before we get into Ebola and the shocking news on that front today,
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  talking about the awakening. I mean, I've had dinner with you, hung out with you and your wife last week when you were here in town.
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  You're a really smart guy. You were in army special operations. There are a lot of interesting things you've seen behind the curtain.
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.000]  What do you call this awakening? And am I overestimating it or underestimating it?
[40:57.000 --> 41:06.000]  No, I think that, you know, like yourself, I mean, I'm really involved in looking at more or less the eugenics part of it,
[41:06.000 --> 41:13.000]  how everything ties together with the health care. You know, hey, I was, you know, like you said, you're a Republican.
[41:13.000 --> 41:21.000]  I was all into pharmaceuticals and wanted to be a medical doctor until I started finding out the truth and started digging deeper and digging deeper.
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  And now I'm looking at it as, you know, what's going on and how this is affecting the masses all over the world.
[41:27.000 --> 41:35.000]  And I think that we're at a tipping point. I mean, we're at the maximum. Well, I wouldn't say maximum, but like you said, I mean,
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  We're approaching the maximum. We're approaching event horizon.
[41:40.000 --> 41:47.000]  Houston, I'm starting to see Homeland Security cars driving around. We have a whole building being built downtown for Homeland Security.
[41:47.000 --> 41:57.000]  So you see Homeland Security working with the local police departments, but at the same time, I have Houston police department officers that come by here
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  that tell me that they see what's going on inside. They are waking up. So it's a 50-50 thing. You know, you have the positive and the negative.
[42:04.000 --> 42:14.000]  Sometimes you have more negative and then all of a sudden you'll have more positive. So it's really, I would say the strongest fight right now
[42:14.000 --> 42:21.000]  in healthcare and politics. I mean, all the way around, which is happening and people are waking up.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  I, you know, I like to think people would wake up a little bit faster.
[42:24.000 --> 42:32.000]  But the main thing that I've been focusing on is teaching people how to wake up by getting healthier and supporting their body's natural immune system
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  and supporting their self-healing mechanism because really that's what it all comes down to.
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  I mean, if you look at every single aspect that, you know, the globalists have used through poisoning the air and the food and the water,
[42:44.000 --> 42:53.000]  it's all designed really to dumb you down to make you mentally retarded to, you know, lower your IQ levels to affect your body so you're sick
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  to instill fear into your system, which drops your immune system by 50%.
[42:58.000 --> 43:06.000]  So getting the word out to people about how they can keep their immune system strong, how they can keep their bodies clean,
[43:06.000 --> 43:16.000]  how they can avoid all that, how they, you know, just knowing the information, how they can protect themselves against fear.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  You know, I mean, that's probably one of the biggest things out here, you know, with this Ebola.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  The way I do it is I take action against something and then that calms me down and makes me feel good.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  Well, exactly. I'm not scared of anything because I've taken action and many of your listeners have taken action too.
[43:30.000 --> 43:38.000]  They know what to do. I mean, you know, if you know what to do with an Ebola outbreak, if you know what to do with a pandemic,
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  you've prepared for all that. You've got food storage. You've got a place to go.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  You've stocked up on, you know, silver. You've stocked up on iodine.
[43:46.000 --> 43:54.000]  You've stocked up on the things that are going to protect yourselves, the NA force, all that stuff that's there to protect you
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.000]  and to boost your own immune system and to keep your body strong and you have a plan, then there's nothing to fear.
[44:01.000 --> 44:12.000]  I mean, you know, if you understand the, how the globalists and how all those individuals operate, you know, and you just look at why are they breaking all the rules here?
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  Why is Obama signing executive order to, you know, that can force action?
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  They're moving on all fronts now. They don't care anymore. I've never seen so much corruption. What does that signify to you as an indicator?
[44:23.000 --> 44:32.000]  Just the fact of how they've handled this Ebola situation, if you look at the supposedly pandemics in the past with swine flu, H1N1,
[44:32.000 --> 44:41.000]  I would say this is by far the worst scenario that we've been in just because the way the government and the World Health Organization is handling the situation,
[44:41.000 --> 44:50.000]  bringing people into uninfected countries. I mean, this is like insane. You quarantined an area with a potential pandemic.
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.000]  You never fly people into the United States and fly people into other countries.
[44:55.000 --> 45:05.000]  And, you know, now with what you're saying with the funeral homes and everything, I would say with the connections to the vaccinations,
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  with them being able to forcibly vaccinate, that's a whole other thing.
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  You know, get out of a densely crowded populated city as fast as you can.
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.000]  But more importantly is just make sure that you have what you need for you and your family.
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  I was about to say, I'm just going to stay away from crowds if it actually gets in the population.
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  I mean, clearly, I don't think it's going to get that bad over here. I hope it doesn't show up over here.
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  It may already have. They're reporting on CBS News, but it's going to be the fear the government puts out in the vaccine they roll out,
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  like the polio vaccine that they admit gave people polio, like my grandmother.
[45:40.000 --> 45:48.000]  Here's CBS News for folks that just joined us. North Texas Hospital evaluating patient for potential Ebola exposure.
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.000]  Ebola Alert, U.S. Patient Zero, suspected in Dallas. Travel history and symptoms suggest infection.
[45:54.000 --> 46:02.000]  Plans for mass graves confirmed. Infowars.com. Dallas Hospital, possible Ebola patient.
[46:02.000 --> 46:10.000]  Nine News. And then I've got my other report here by Paul Joseph Watson upon infowars.com,
[46:10.000 --> 46:16.000]  the one we were just mentioning. CDC warns funeral homes in the U.S. have prepared for Ebola victims.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  They've never done this before. Why would they bring Ebola patients in, Dr. Group?
[46:20.000 --> 46:28.000]  Why would they do that and then start saying get ready for it? I mean, it looks premeditated.
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  Everything that's been happening in the last five years has pretty much been right in our face.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  They're getting to the point now where they don't even care. It used to be kind of secretive,
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  but now they're doing it right in front of you and they're reporting it on the news.
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.000]  We're bringing Ebola patients right into the U.S. and they're just testing the reactions
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  and the reactions of the general population and seeing what they're going to do.
[46:52.000 --> 46:58.000]  They just keep pushing it further and further and further to the limit and nobody's doing anything about it except us.
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.000]  There are a select group of people that are calling us, finding, hey, listen, how is this happening?
[47:04.000 --> 47:11.000]  What can we do to protect ourselves? But the more that they push, also the more that they can create fear
[47:11.000 --> 47:17.000]  and then you have that 80, 90% of the population out there that says, government, we depend on you.
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  What are you going to do for us? And they start calling and pushing the CDC and the World Health Organization
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.000]  into vaccines and they'll line up at every single drug store all day long.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  If a vaccine came out tomorrow in Ebola vaccine and it was distributed through every drug store in the United States,
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  the scary thing is 80, 90% of the population would run down there with their kids and everything
[47:40.000 --> 47:48.000]  and take an untested vaccination. And not only that, you have stuff that's going on in the United States right now,
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.000]  these weird respiratory illnesses that are affecting the children all over the place, the adults,
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  the amendment Obama signed that they can physically detain anyone with signs of respiratory illness.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  He did that a couple months ago and then magically this starts and then they admit it's linked to the vaccines.
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  We had Dr. Blalock, brain surgeon, medical doctor on your stay. He was saying it's called mutations from the vaccines,
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  causing other viruses in the gut to then mutate. I mean, it's and that they all know this.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  So it's clearly on purpose, incredible. I want to shift gears briefly.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  A couple of months ago, it's 12 weeks ago, we came out with DNA force, the most powerful formula ever,
[48:28.000 --> 48:36.000]  literally for on record doing amazing things inside the body. And I've been taking it even before it came out.
[48:36.000 --> 48:42.000]  Everybody in my family that's taken it has been blown away. It's the flagship of info wars, life.com products.
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  Spend a couple minutes telling people what's in DNA force that you helped us develop with my dad.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  Break down what this formula does. And when people purchase it, it also supports the transmission.
[48:55.000 --> 49:04.000]  Yeah, this is actually of an amazing formula and, you know, just a response from the people that have that got the DNA force from info wars.
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.000]  I've had people contact me. It's amazing. And the reason why we developed it is because there's such an attack on the cells.
[49:11.000 --> 49:19.000]  I mean, if you look at the body, what decreases, what causes aging, what decreases cellular function, what harms the cells?
[49:19.000 --> 49:27.000]  And those are all free radicals. It's free radical damage from, you know, all of the chemicals that you're ingesting in the food and the beverage and everything else.
[49:27.000 --> 49:35.000]  And if you're sick, the immune system has to work extra hard stress. I mean, stress is causing an immune deficiency.
[49:35.000 --> 49:44.000]  And the majority of people over 35 right now lack of sleep. So, you know, looking back, it's all about looking at the root cause of what's going on in the body.
[49:44.000 --> 49:54.000]  And if the cells are being attacked, our main mission was to be the first company in the world working with your dad to develop a product.
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  Cause again, you know, we're really big on cleansing and cleansing and cleansing and that's great for the cells.
[49:59.000 --> 50:08.000]  But a lot of people out there want the extra ability to protect their cells from free radical damage and to, you know, slow down the aging process.
[50:08.000 --> 50:17.000]  I mean, the anti-aging market out there is an incredible market for folks who don't know that this is a whole bunch of patented certified organic compounds.
[50:17.000 --> 50:23.000]  We'll talk about when we come back from break and hit some other Ebola news that we're even able to actually say what it does.
[50:23.000 --> 50:32.000]  You don't see that with other supplements because they're not this nutraceutical level of just absolutely certified ingredients.
[50:32.000 --> 50:44.000]  Right. Yeah. So some of the ingredients on there, like the BioPQQ, which is a micronutrient, which is a strong antioxidant, it protects mitochondria from oxidative damage.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  And it actually, in studies, has been shown to grow fresh mitochondria.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  Mitochondria is the powerhouse of everybody's cells.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  So, I mean, if you really want to support that for extra...
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  Stay there, Dr. Group. InfoWarsLive.com. DNA Force is back in.
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.000]  Listen to the real world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien. I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[51:24.000 --> 51:31.000]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen,
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  which is bitterly markable because I rarely get that feeling.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  The only thing I've actually added to my routine is One World Way. Wow!

[53:59.000 --> 54:20.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on your mind.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  You know, Dr. Groups saying get sunshine, drink purified water, get the right minerals and nutrients to protect your body.
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.000]  Get your immune system up. No, no, no. Ezekiel Emanuel who helped write Obamacare has said it's meant to bankrupt the country.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  Death panels are real. We should get rid of old people.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  So I thought we should actually have him on the show here. So there's fairness doctrine.
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.000]  And so here he is. If you're watching us on TV at infowars.com, infowars.com forward slash show.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  You can see it. And here he is. He has something to say to all the viewers and listeners out there.
[54:54.000 --> 55:07.000]  Ezekiel Emanuel, Obamacare spokesman, Obamacare head. Go ahead, sir.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  Ezekiel Emanuel. Let's pull out so folks can see him.
[55:11.000 --> 55:19.000]  You know, he kind of... Obamacare. They love us bringing Ebola patients in.
[55:19.000 --> 55:29.000]  Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel. Why? Why? Why? He lovingly... He looks like the Grim Reaper, but I guess actually up is down, down is up, black is white now.
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.000]  So that's the good guy. George Washington's bad. Christians are bad. Christ is bad.
[55:34.000 --> 55:41.000]  The Grim Reaper Ezekiel Emanuel. Angel of Death is good. Angel of Death flying free.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  Stopping the sarcasm. Ron Paul's coming up. We have this segment. One little short one left with Dr. Group.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  Getting serious here. It's really becoming obvious what they're up to, what they're doing.
[55:51.000 --> 56:00.000]  And they're really moving in, trying to stop folks from getting high quality supplements like X2 and the DNA force and the occupower.
[56:00.000 --> 56:09.000]  Everybody can see what it's done for me. They've seen and heard the testimonials. Here are a couple of them that have come in right here.
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.000]  Tell folks about some of the testimonials you've been seeing yourself on DNA force X2. You name it, Dr. Group.
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.000]  I mean, you know, out of thousands of people that have used it, they online, there's four or five stars.
[56:23.000 --> 56:30.000]  I mean, mostly like four and a half stars. We hardly ever get anybody that sends a product back.
[56:30.000 --> 56:39.000]  I mean, but that's what we're about. I mean, we don't create products that are second best. I mean, our products are guaranteed to be the best in the world.
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  I mean, if you can find a better product out there, we'll buy it for you and we've never even had that.
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  Well, Obamacare's a better product. Doubles or triple prices. Gets rid of your doctor and creates euthanasia squads and death lists for veterans.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[56:54.000 --> 57:02.000]  You know, that's that's a pretty bad. It's a disaster, actually. I mean, Obamacare is doing nothing but addressing the root cause.
[57:02.000 --> 57:10.000]  Listen, the medical profession has never focused on the root cause. They do not want you to know what causes disease.
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.000]  They don't want you to know how to fix disease. I mean, all they want you to do is get on their medications and eventually die.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  I mean, that's why people need to look away from.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  Now, don't get me wrong. If you get in a car accident, you have broken bones, emergency situations. We have the best medical system in the world.
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  But as far as the doctor group, no, Obamacare love you.
[57:32.000 --> 57:46.000]  Yeah, I don't know about Obamacare. Now we'll see how that works out because, you know, pretty soon, I'm sure somebody will get in a car accident and they'll be bleeding to death and they'll and then they'll wait five hours to approve the Obamacare insurance plan.
[57:46.000 --> 57:52.000]  They'll bleed out. So I can't say that anymore, but I mean, our doctors are at least trained to save your life.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  Now, you know, I don't know.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  Well, sure, the doctors are against Obamacare, almost all of them.
[57:56.000 --> 58:06.000]  Look, people need to get DNA force because literally one ingredient cost us upwards of $40 a bottle just for the one ingredient.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  And there's a whole bunch of ingredients in there.
[58:08.000 --> 58:17.000]  The bio PQQ, a whole bunch of ingredients, infowarslife.com, go read about them. That's why it's $130 a bottle or $129 a bottle.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  Leading competitors that aren't even as strong folks are 300 to 600 or even more.
[58:22.000 --> 58:29.000]  This is a true nutraceutical in every sense of the word at an incredibly low price and it helps us fund our operation here.
[58:29.000 --> 58:38.000]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139. And of course, you can also get our Clotal Silver. It's $19.95.
[58:38.000 --> 58:45.000]  And some of the best out there, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.000]  Or there's Obamacare, which loves you. It's for the children. You can always have that.
[58:50.000 --> 58:57.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[58:57.000 --> 59:05.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[59:17.000 --> 59:22.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[59:22.000 --> 59:32.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[59:36.000 --> 59:43.000]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[59:43.000 --> 59:53.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[59:53.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  CJ made the joke. I don't want to steal his joke that politicians talk out of their rear ends.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  And I got this little grim-raper that we're calling a Zika Lemanual. You couldn't really hear him earlier because I put this face up to the microphone.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  You actually have to put his Obama up to the microphone to hear it, so here we go.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  But if you're against Obamacare, you're racist. We'll get your guns. It's so much fun.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Oh, so loving. Oh, so good. Obamacare.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Okay, Ron Paul's coming up. Finishing up, Dr. Group of the Global Healing Center that helped develop DNA force, Occupower, you name it. Not only are you getting the best supplements out there from our research folks, you're helping find the tip of the spear on the info wars.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  I want to thank all of you, whether it's the Silver Bullet or whether it's the nascent iodine X2, whether it's the super mill vitality, all of it is super high quality and funds the operation.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  But spend a few more minutes talking about DNA force itself and some of the other compounds that are in it.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Okay, so, yeah, I mean, DNA force is incredible because we took the best compounds that would help kind of preserve you. I mean, some of these compounds extended the life of mice and testing by 30%.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  So, I mean, you know, what would you give to do that? I mean, I've been taking it for three or four months now and people that I haven't seen in a while say I look, you know, a few years younger.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  But what it's designed to do is to help your skin glow, to look younger, to feel younger. It's great for the heart. There's ingredients in there like pteropyr, which contains a concentrate from blueberries.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  There's a CoQ10 in there. Oh, yeah, explain how many blueberries you'd have to eat to get what's in one serving of this.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  You'd have to eat 500 little bitty pallets of blueberries, you know, those little bitty cases of blueberries that you get.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  So, I mean, basically, this formula is excellent because most of your mitochondria are going to be in your heart cells, your brain cells, your skin cells.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  So, it really works on the heart. Each ingredient alone, I recommend people go to look at because we chose the best of the best.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  So, it's really an overall graceful. Exactly. Just try it. Just try it, folks, because you're going to discover.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Just try the X2. Try the survival shield. Try the Supermobile Vitality, but really try the DNA force because you've heard the rave reviews, you've heard the calls.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  This stuff really is revolutionary. We've had a lot of people that have had great success with just stress and mental clarity as well with this formula.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  I mean, some of the ingredients there have been proven in clinical studies to increase mental clarity, especially during times of stress.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  So, it's an all-in-one formula, really, that just helps protect every single thing in your body.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  It also helps the mitochondria and the telomeres in there from damage, and that's really what causes the aging process.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  And again, the BioPQQ. Talk about some of the other patented compounds that are in here briefly.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Okay. Well, we have our lipoic acid, and that's known to support cardiovascular health. It encourages normal blood pressure.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  It's hot. The antioxidant capacity of that is great. We have a special type of CoQ10.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  We have the CoQ10, which is the made in the USA pure form. It's one of the only ones in the world made in the USA.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And that CoQ10 is an enzyme necessary for proper cardiovascular function.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  It's clinically proven to help support your immune system, strengthen the body's defenses, especially, you know, we have these potential-
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Trans-reservatrol.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  The trans-resveratrol, I mean, resveratrol has been talked about for years as a potent antioxidant.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  We use the trans-resveratrol, which is 99% purity. It's the purest one on the market.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Dr. Group, we're out of time. Fantastic job. Thank you with DNA Force. Get yours before it sells out infowarslife.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-2533-139.

[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  Place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  Oftentimes, full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives, or worse, gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Oxipowder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Instead, oxipowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  To experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology, go to infowarslife.com, or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxipowder, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  This is Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Well, we're always honored to have the living legend, doctor, former congressman, family man, patriot, Ron Paul on with us, and of course his son in every major poll out there, is the front runner, and hasn't even announced yet, and is the front runner in New Hampshire as well,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  and is presenting the big CPAC polls. Senator Rand Paul, ladies and gentlemen, so it's so exciting to have former congressman Ron Paul on with us for the next 20 minutes or so to cover the waterfront.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Sure thing. Good to be with you.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Wow, there's so much to hit. First off, ISIS, now saying race for imminent terror attacks. Give up your liberties. What's really behind that?
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Well, you know, it's a reflection of a deeply flawed foreign policy. I do think that people should be aware of the fact that the more we do over there, the more likely there will be terrorist attacks.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  But right now, we're accommodating the radicals by just going over and staying their backyard. One time, Ben Lawdon said, fine, come over here.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  By this on our stand, it's easier to kill you here than it is to come over to the United States. So, yeah, we're accommodating them, and so there will be attacks, but that doesn't mean that tomorrow several American cities are going to be blown up.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  But long term, that's still going to be a possibility because there's a lot of anger that builds up and they feel very frustrated, and people say, well, you're bashing America, you're blaming America for all that.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  But what about from their viewpoint? Is it terroristic to have a family wiped out that is at a wedding party because a drone dropped the missile and he missed the target and it hit some innocent people?
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  That sounds rather terroristic to me, so there's so much hypocrisy that goes on, but Obama the other day when he was giving his speech, he said, well, yeah, we misjudged this.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Of course, we misjudged the army that we have built up in Iraq. They didn't fight very well, but we've also misjudged al-Qaeda.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  We thought we had them whipped, and we really did, but there was a small remnant left over, and that morphed into ISIS, and we just didn't pay enough attention to it.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So on and on it goes, at the same time, do they ever say, well, what was this place like before we went in? Yeah, we had this terrible monster Saddam Hussein who couldn't stand al-Qaeda and didn't get along with the Iranians.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  So we forcibly throw him out and give it a, make it a haven for al-Qaeda. And of course, this pretence that we got rid of al-Qaeda is just a pretence.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  So what do we do? We set the stage for another war, and the Nobel Peace Prize-winning president that we have says that the good war is Afghanistan, and it looks to me like he thinks it's not such a bad idea going into Syria.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  Well, they've given Henry Kissinger and Al Gore peace prizes, so it's really a mark of shame in my view now to have one, but I did hear they're talking about giving Genghis Khan a Nobel laureate peace prize posthumously.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  I haven't heard that one. That ought to be interesting. Well, I mean, he did launch a lot of wars, so why not give him one? Yeah, that's right.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  I'm being sarcastic. I don't start giving them to Hitler and Stalin and a few others, you know. Why not? That's a good idea. We could nominate Stalin or something.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  Again, Ron Paul is joining us live here on the Susie edition. If you've just tuned in, you can check out his amazing multimedia TV, radio, podcast system, RonPaulChannel.com. Many of our affiliates that carry my show also carry his show around the country, so it's very, very exciting to see really what I think is the hope is the new media displacing the establishment media.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  The inventor of the Internet was in Reuters yesterday over in England, and we'll put that story up on screen, saying that the very freedom of the web is threatened. We had William Binney on a few weeks ago, former director of intelligence for the NSA, saying it is a totalitarian takeover.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  It is targeting the people. I mean, we have a lot of prominent folks, not just you or the former president of the Czech Republic. We have a lot of prominent people that are coming out and saying, look out. What's your view on Internet freedom?
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Well, it's being diminished. I mean, the larger the government gets, the less freedom that we have. But in the same sense, there's a counterbalance to this because there's a lot of rebellion going on right now. I mean, just think how strong the secessionist movements are, people who want their independence.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  That's pretty strong, even though there's not tremendous success so far, but the ideas are changing. And one thing I've noticed that in some of these boats, in the referendums that occur, it shows that young people are more likely to say, you know, let's get out of this big government business.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  They're the ones that are messing up the economy and they're the ones who get us into wars. So, yes, they're very much involved. And of course, we brainwash the military that we have and the American people saying, well, we have to do this because we have to be over there because we have to defend our freedoms.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  We have to defend our Constitution, protect our national security. But they can lie about that just so long because it has nothing to do with it. It has more to do with what the subject you bring up. What they're talking about is that they justify the war.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  People can get frightened into giving up their liberties. They don't even have to come in here and invade us. We create NSA and we create patriot action and these secret courts. So, we unfortunately do a lot more harm to our liberties than any outsider ever dreamed of.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Tim Berners-Lee, who's credited more than anyone of being the true inventor of the Internet, not Al Gore, has nothing to do with it, folks, is saying that basically the same thing, leave it alone, leave it free. All the inventors, all the trailblazers, all the experts agree with you, Congressman, Ron Paul again joining us.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  You've made one of your main initiatives in the last few years trying to defend the Web, which is laudable, obviously, but when we have almost all the inventors of it, all the experts agreeing with you, how could the establishment then be still marching towards draconian control of the Web?
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Well, they think they can do it because they have a lot of guns and they have a lot of authority, but I think there's a building. Who was it? Google and somebody else developing a telephone that the government couldn't even get into.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  I mean, that's the counterbalance and I have a lot of confidence in technology, even with the abusive state. Technology can counteract this. Oftentimes, we would have laws being proposed in Washington that will have how to solve the problem of getting phone calls that you aren't solicited,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  so we need more federal government regulations to regulate your phone and who can call you when and have these lists, no-call lists. See, I opposed all that because I always believed, and rightfully so, that we can get technology into our telephone system.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  We can include a number. We don't want to answer. We don't have to, and spamming protection helps us to some degree. Technology by the government is always going to be used against us, but we have to try to get the smart people on our side to make sure the technology protects our liberties.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Case in point, as you know, Congress has tried to pass a bunch of laws about pop-up ads on the Internet to get their claws into that. Instead, people just download free pop-up blockers that works perfectly in almost every case.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Again, innovation is the answer, not more regulation. I saw a study that came out, I'm sure you saw it from a major university about a month ago, that the U.S. is now 33 worldwide for economic freedom behind every industrialized nation. I mean, this country is not as free as it used to be.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  It's going in the wrong direction, but what about on television? I don't watch these movies and things, but people who download or set their programs, can't they go back and watch the program and click off? They don't have to listen to the ad, so that's another way that they can serve their own benefits.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  I still want to be the optimist to say that this technology is about time it's being used for a good reason. My argument is that for thousands of years, all technology has been used for the state in enhanced war.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  Whether it's jet powers or nuclear energy or whatever, it's always been used to build bigger and worse weapons. I think now we are moving into an age where we are capable as human beings to take technology and use it to do exactly the opposite.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  I know that it's early on and it's a big transition and it might be a stretch, but why not? Why not even think that it's a possibility that we can use technology for the advancement of peace and prosperity rather than using it to enhance the power of the state?
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  RonPaulChannel.com. Dr. RonPaul joins us. I want to ask you about Ebola in a moment, but since we were talking about Al Qaeda and our government giving them weapons and calling them ISIS, Hissle, Congressman Walter Jones, as you know, is introduced to build or release the 28 pages.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  I've talked to him and others that have seen it. I've talked to Colonel Shaffer and others. I know you've spoken out now. I mean, clearly it's Saudi Arabia in there that our government knew bare minimum was standing down.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  What is your view of the 28 pages of the 9-11 report that's been made secret and what should be done about that?
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  Well, we're doing our very best to galvanize the people who believe that we have a right to see that. And even those people that were involved in the investigations we generally think are part of the establishment.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  We're saying we should see this too, so that is very, very good. And this should be the whole purpose. Unfortunately, all commissions that I have witnessed generally are there to cover up the mistakes of government and to protect government agents so they never get blamed for anything or never get punished for anything.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  So I do everything. I had Walter on the program. We interviewed him on the channel and we're trying to build up as much pressure. Some day maybe, but they're going to fight it.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  But I don't think it takes the genius to figure this out. The first thing is, I think what government does is almost they encourage the speculation about what's going on and they do this by claiming that we don't even know what's happening out there and yet we do.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  What about right after this thing happened? I remember being stranded in Washington and I couldn't get out of Washington after 9-11. The airports were a horrendous mess and then I hear the story.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  Well, you know, the Saudis got out, the Bin Laden family got out and the FBI never even asked them a question. I mean, if that doesn't make you suspicious of what's going on, nothing will. But we have yet to learn all the truth of it and I think that's what our job ought to be and that is finding out the truth rather than the lies.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  Of course, my statement has always been that if there is an empire and you tell the truth, the truth becomes the reason. That's why the whistleblowers get into so much trouble, Greenwald and others get into big trouble by just trying to tell us the truth.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  That's right. Now, continuing a few final questions in the five minutes we have left with former Congressman Ron Paul. Ron, looking at the economy, I want to spend a few minutes on that. I want to look at Ebola and then we'll talk about Rand 2016.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  You're a medical doctor. I'm not a medical doctor, but I know the standard policy was don't bring Ebola patients or smallpox patients into the U.S. Now they're bringing them in by the score. They think they may have someone who got a new hazard in Dallas right now, that's CBS News.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  What is going on here as a medical doctor? What's your take on this?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  I think we should have stayed out of this. This is another example of how foreign aid backfires on us. A lot of people, people dying, serious disease, we're the smartest in the world. We have to go over there. We have a military power that sends 3,000 troops to fight Ebola.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  So we send our people over there. We know there's an epidemic, but it's interesting there was a report that showed that this part of the world has put up with epidemics of diseases like this for a long time.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  They had certain rules built into their society that if there's a bad disease going around some small town or area that you quarantine, and it was almost soft quarantine, don't come in and you don't leave. It was self-contained.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  We go over and we get involved and we send people in and out. It just behooves me to think about how we messed it up. Besides, I keep thinking, although I know how serious this is, I know a lot of people are dying, but in perspective, how many people...
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  When I think about the problem that the world faces and the problems have been compounded by government about malaria, we have a couple hundred million people get malaria every year.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  We have 1.2 million people die of malaria every year, and it's been compounded by government intervention and the inability to use sprays to kill the mosquitoes.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  They were really, really concerned when the concern for the people who died from malaria be at least equal to a couple thousand dying from the Ebola.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  I agree. They have to make it be 40 million people have died since they banned DDT and won't even allow something to come out that's a lot safer.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  The key point you just made, Ron Paul, in the few minutes we have left here, the economy. I personally travel around the country some and outside the U.S.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  And just food prices have more than doubled the last year. Everything is so expensive, I can't imagine what it's like for poor people to survive.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Yeah, but you don't believe the government. The government reports CPI and that's what really counts. CPI is not going up. Everybody's okay.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  And their standard of living is going up and they're not having a problem. The value of the dollar is being held up.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Of course, being cynical, but I think the real conspiracy that goes on is to prop up the dollar.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  It's not so much conspiring in some ways, but it is. The big guys and the central banks, everything is dependent on the dollar right now.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  The dollar is very strong compared to other dollars because we have promised and we have acted this way in the crisis that we're going through right now since 2008.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  We bail out everybody, not only all our banks, but all the central banks of the world and all the governments and all the currencies of the world.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  So they have an interest. Everybody has an interest in protecting the dollar, but ultimately they won't be able to and I think we're a fast approach at that time.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  Well, sure. I mean, I read the Basic Economics. There's a race worldwide to devalue, so it's like Helter Skelter coming down fast but miles above you.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  It's like a sinking mountain into the ocean. We're on the top, but we're still sinking and most economists across the board admit there'll be a comeuppance.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  As your gut tell you as a student of Von Mies, who saw this out 30 years ago, how long can this go on?
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  Well, that's the one thing that Austrian economics teaches that we can have a pretty good understanding of which way things are going.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  You know, print a lot of money and the value of the dollar goes down, but they also have an emphasis on the subjective theory of value and that is there are subjective elements in it.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  Sometimes even a strong military bestows confidence in a currency. So money supply is important, but the perceptions are important and military is important.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  And so therefore you don't know when it's going to end. Right now we have some excitement going on over in Hong Kong.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  It's sort of stirred in the markets a little bit. So some morning we'll wake up and there'll be something much bigger than what we just saw at Hong Kong.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Maybe it'll be all of China or something that's blown up economically and then that will be the end of it and people will have to realize that you can't live on debt forever and that's what they believe they can do now.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  Debt as far as the Keynesians are concerned is not a problem. The only problem is if you want to accumulate debt and spend more money, that is the only problem they have to worry about.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  Alright, I know you've got to go. One last question, RonPaulChannel.com. I'm seeing Ted Cruz, who I like, but I don't trust as much as your son, coming out and saying he's going to focus mainly on foreign policy in his campaign for president.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  Clearly he's running. We know Rand's running. Rand is focusing on foreign domestic as well, but I really think focusing on tax cuts, focusing on regulatory rollbacks, getting back to the Constitution, that's what people want.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  I think Cruz is making a mistake. What are you advising Rand to do? I'm just trying to give my two cents. Don't you think we need to focus on domestic issues?
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Yeah, we do, but I'm not in the business of volunteering my advice. I think he knows where I stand on these issues, but one other thing that he does without my emphasis directly at him, but my emphasis over the years, and that is this whole issue of privacy.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  He's done such a good job on that, and showing how abusive our government has been. I think that is catching on, and I think he's still going to have a strong attraction to the young people, and that's a big issue for them.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  What is it like to see your son being the presidential frontrunner for the grand old party?
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  It's great, but to me it's also a mixed bag, because I know what the piling on and the yelling and screaming by the enemies and the distortions that go on, and what's going to happen, what the establishment will do.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  Yes, I'm very pleased not only for him, but I'm pleased to promote the message, but I'm also thinking about you're going to get some hard knocks, and no parent would feel good when their kids get hard knocks.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  You've got to be proud of him, and he's just one more example of the legacy that you continue to put out there of freedom, and I hope others step up and promote liberty, because you're another testament, Ron Paul, to what an individual can do taking action.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  God bless you. Have a great week coming up, sir.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Thank you.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Bye-bye.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  Thank you. There goes former Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Yeah, I mean, Ted Cruz thinks he can score a bunch of points against Obama on ISIS and stuff, and sure he can.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  And I like Ted Cruz. I really admire him, and we've only interviewed him once for TV, and I wish I would have, you know, gotten involved with him earlier, because he was very accessible, and we haven't really bugged him now.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  But, you know, his wife was in the Council on Foreign Relations, but I know a lot of people that were in it and got out of it.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  Just because you were in that doesn't mean you're bad. It's got like 7,000 members now. It's gotten bigger. It's the steering committee that's really bad news.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  And, you know, work for Goldman Sachs and stuff. But I mean, we've got to be ready for people in the system to promote liberty.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  You have to go off what they do now. And he promoted freedom when he was married to his wife.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  So I'm just having a discussion here openly, I guess, with myself and you, the listeners, about Ron Paul, about Ted Cruz.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  It's time to discuss that. I just have known Ron Paul since 1996.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  I know him quite well, and I'll just leave it at that. And I know he's for real.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  I mean, he plays a little bit of politics and stuff to get a position to run for president, but you think about him versus a Dianne Feinstein,
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  or versus an Al Gore or something like that. I mean, it's just, it's night and day.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  It's, it's, it's total night and day, and he's willing to get up there and take his licks and be attacked.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  They're going to try every dirty trick in the known universe on him.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  And part of me says, hey, let the Democrats get back in and just wreck everything. So to let Rand Paul get in and end up blaming him for everything.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  But, you know, just as we done May the Heavens fall, I don't want to go that route.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Although let's just let it get worse and worse and that'll wake people up. No, we can't survive it.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  We can't get a John Boehner type or a Jeb Bush type, another neocon.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  I know Boehner isn't running, but you know, Chris Christie, we need somebody who really doesn't want to wreck the country and isn't going to play games.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  I mean, Rand Paul says, yeah, I'm all for bombing ISIS, but I don't trust you to bomb them because you've been funding them, Obama.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  And hey, John McCain, why are you hanging out with Al Qaeda? I mean, hey, the drug war is a fraud and hey, the NSA is a fraud.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  I mean, Rand Paul is better than Ted Cruz. It's just a fact. We'll be right back. Stay with us, infowars.com.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.

[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape,
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  but that we can fight back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.

[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  We know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.

[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  Just won't quit.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  in the heart of the Resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  I'm going to be honest with you, 15 years ago when I first got a chance to meet and know
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  pretty big movie stars, pretty big celebrities.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  It was a little awe-inspiring to be in New York City or Los Angeles in a big mansion
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  and to be invited out to dinner and I thought it was really cool.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  But I got a bird's-eye view into how the general public imagines celebrities in the whole culture
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  like some Elysium world heavenly place.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  It's actually a prison and the worst vibes overall I've ever felt.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  That's why so many big celebrities don't live in LA or don't live in New York
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  trying to stay away from the celebrity because it is so horribly empty.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  And the reason I just opened this segment up with that statement is I was thinking about
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  how the only people I get excited about are trailblazers and people that are honorable and good.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  And how a rockstar to me is Dr. Stan Monteef who spent, I kept saying 48 years,
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  that was like four years ago when he gave that speech, so it was 52 years,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  two years battling cancer and excruciating pain to stay on air five days a week, five hours a day
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  on over 100 plus stations nationwide.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  And just how smart he was, how committed, how loving.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  I see that in my family.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  I mean, I grew up having no idea how great my grandfathers and grandmothers were,
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  how great my parents were compared.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  Now, being 40, I matured a lot more.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  A lot of 40 year olds aren't that mature because they don't really become even adults
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  or they're 30 or something, there's a rest of development.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  I've been, I mean, I grew up pretty quick.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  I was doing stuff when I was 13, the guys are doing when they're 20,
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  but still I was immature in many ways.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  And now as I get older, it's just like, oh, I wish I could let the young people know what I know
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  to not get in trouble and not be part of the system and to not care what people think about you.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  And then I realized the general public is that way.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  Adults really only care about the fake status, the empty status of the fanciest car or the biggest house.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  Well, if you like a fancy car and a big house, that's great.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  It's a place to have parties and have your friends over and you have employees as part of the economy.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  I'm not against the wealth.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  It's just, it can't be the capstone on the pyramid.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  What is the capstone on the pyramid is being in societies of men and women where you're about not screwing each other over.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  Your word is your bond.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  You're honorable.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  People can trust you and to have been led into those societies.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  And it took so long.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  I was never even trying to get into those societies.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  I don't even mean like a secret society.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  I mean a society in general.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  And now people know I don't screw people over.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  People know I'm for real.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  People know and then those doors just open and then you find that there's these societies of people that are honorable and good.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  People like Dr. Blalock.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  People like Dr. Monteef.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  I don't know why so many times it's doctors because they've attacked doctors and torn down their image.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  It's a lot of them are corrupt and bad in the society.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  But it's like my dad's grandfather that was a medical doctor that had the whole black bag and you know still wrote around a horse and carriage before he got a car.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  It was all about being honorable, being good, being upright, being smart, being learned, being strong, having dignity.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  And they've taken our dignity.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Gerald Salente talks a lot about this.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  I mean I look at photos and old newsreels of black people.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and even 60s.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  And their eyes are sharp.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  They're dressed nice.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  They have dignity.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  The white people are the same.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  And now it's just not there.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Our souls have been sucked.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  We have been just robbed of everything that's honorable and I am dishonorable compared to many of my ancestors.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  And I'm not a dishonorable person. I'm just saying I am weak and worldly compared to many of my forebears and I can see the degeneration of my line.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  But that is what civilization is made of, is realizing, pull yourself up and within that discipline, the discipline of Ron Paul who I know, I know works 14 hours a day at 78 years old.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  And jogs and rides a bicycle and works out and still has a couple beers.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  I mean it's just a manly man.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  And he doesn't have a big tough bearing.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  It's the long haul of being the doctor, the Vietnam vet, the husband, the father raising those kids, doing all that, going to Congress, being laughed at in the 80s, getting kicked out, getting back in in 96, having no co-sponsors.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  And now it's bills that he wrote years ago are passing the house.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  People are picking them up and reintroducing them.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  It's just the testament of the long haul, the great striving.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Can you guys pull up the arena by Teddy Roosevelt?
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  I want to read that poem on air.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  It's not even a poem, it's a statement.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  Because that is the human experience.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  That's the heroes out there is a woman whose husband dies in a car wreck and she raises three kids and works hard and those kids end up having trouble but getting out of school and getting jobs and getting married and living.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Survival is victory.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  That's a hero.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  And we have to rediscover what makes us great and strive for it.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  So I was just thinking how I'm star struck by Ron Paul.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  And so I went off on this whole jag about so many people, so many people out there think they're not fulfilled because they don't know Brad Pitt.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  They think they're not fulfilled because they don't know Josh Brolin.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  They think they're not fulfilled because they don't know Charlie Sheen.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  They think they're not fulfilled because they don't know Robert Plant.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  They think they're not fulfilled because they don't know Sean Lennon.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  They think they're not fulfilled and it's like a God.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  And you talk to the actual people, they know it's all fraud.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  They know what none of it means anything.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  But it's that image of Hollywood and the culture of the glamour that the glamour says take the vaccines.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  The glamour says families aren't good.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  The glamour says having kids aren't good.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  So then only the most unwashed, dumbed-down people have kids and the whole society falls apart.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  We've already said families crud, so why should it be anything but that?
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  We have to believe in humanity and face down the evils.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Doesn't mean we'll ever defeat all of it, but if we let it run all over us, it will win.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  We have to get involved.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  And so I was just thinking about how sad I am for people that think lying and cheating and stealing and deceiving is the way to get ahead.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  Well, yeah, you get away with it for a short moment, but you lose who you are and then you have no culture, no society.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  There's no honour amongst thieves.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  And there's still a lot of honour in Western civilization, but we've learned to be cowed and shut up and just be honourable inside our houses
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  and just quietly take it with desperation.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Well, I'm not going to take it.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  I'm not here to be run over with my family. I'm not here to aid and abet evil by joining with it.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  And I don't mean the evil that state-run churches tell you about all day about how you're evil and having a beer's evil or doing this is evil or doing that's evil.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  We all know we got problems.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  I'm talking about people that are premeditatedly evil and want to go out and hurt innocents and want to promote abortion and want to promote tyranny
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  and want to promote disarming the people and breaking up families and shooting little kids up with deadly vaccines
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  and shooting pregnant women up when they know full well it hurts the fetuses on record.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  That's evil and that's what I want to hear about from these dirty pulpits with these devils standing up in them.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  After you've dealt with the big dragons.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  See, if they don't deal with the big dragons because the big dragons are scary.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  By the big dragon of the state, you keep your mouth shut about it.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  Well, because you kept your mouth shut, the dragon grew a thousand times and is now burning everything down.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  And you say, oh, let it burn everything down. Let it stomp on everyone.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Hide under some rocks. Maybe the dragon won't get you.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Yeah, today or this week or next year, it'll probably just get your kids.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  No, I will face that dragon.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  And it's not because I'm a hero, folks, you were made to face it.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  You were made to stand up against it.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  That's why you're here.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  That's the test.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  Every one of our ancestors, whether they were good, bad or ugly, had to struggle.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  And we've got to rediscover good from bad and recognize evil and tell it, get out of my way.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  Stop it. No.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  You got to call it out.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  We're going to lose everything.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  You will run and we will live. I run and you might live at least a while, but many years from now lying in your beds.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  What would you give to come back here and face our enemies and tell them you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom?
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  That's truly living.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  I forget it. Who said it, but.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  A man with courage only dies but once cowards die a thousand deaths.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  Well, I know the quote I gave earlier was William Wallace. Yeah, but the quote about.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  We look up. I think it's so old. They don't know who said it, but.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  The brave die a single, but a single death, cowards die a thousand deaths.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  We can see who said that. I know you found the arena quote. I want to read that arena quote. Thank you by Teddy Roosevelt. Thank you.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  I want to be in the arena and I also don't want as a person that wants good to be manipulated because the evil is also good.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  Getting good people to go out and do evil things under the cover of a good cause.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  You have to have the courage to really analyze things and have discernment and decide what you're going to get behind and what you're not.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  They found the quote. Here it is.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  It seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death and necessary end will come when it will come.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  William Shakespeare.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  I knew that was Shakespeare, but it was Shakespeare was taking all the colloquialisms and all the nomenclature of the time and boiling it down.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  It's carved on castle parapets that the brave only taste death once.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  And that's basically what he expanded on.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  Here's a quote by Teddy Roosevelt in a speech given in Paris, France in 1910.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  The man in the arena. I read this on air every few months.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  The credit belongs to the man who was actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  Who strives valiantly, who errors, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds?
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  Who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause?
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, Ron Paul?
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  And who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat?
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  But I would add to that there's still a fate worse.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Imagine being the dark servants of evil that actually know these secrets of chivalry and manhood and womanhood and honor.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  And who seek to keep honor from the blood of the people, who seek to keep liberty, the spirit of freedom from the minds of the kingdom.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  Can you imagine knowing all these secrets that have taken me my entire life to learn were always known
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  and were the bedrock of any successful civilization, hidden, hidden from the people,
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  not codified, not taught, not preached, not given.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  Like manna from heaven to the people who feel bad because their car is old and broken down
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  or feel bad they don't have the new fancy clothes or all the perfect finery.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  When all they really need is to be honorable and strong and respect their family and respect liberty and respect the liberties of others,
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  it's in that dignity and in that respect and in that honor that we will revive civilization
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  and reverse this hurtling runaway 900 mile an hour train going up into the side of a mountain.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Our people, our children of every race, color, creed, religion are on a runaway train on a runaway planet
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  blasting through space, hurtling around that fiery ball.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  All the people that came before us, all the past generations, all that they strove for, the tyrants, the lovers, the artists,
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  this one was weak, this one was strong, this one a traitor, this one honorable, all of it went on on this planet,
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  all of it into the eyes of the Creator, who your very soul knows is there,
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  the very presence of the universe and its Creator, breathing down our neck, reminding us of eternity.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  But the atheists and the establishment, they want to be God, they want to say there's nothing in the world but the black pyramid,
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  there's nothing in the world but the Madison Avenue, there's nothing in the world but Times Square,
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  there's nothing in the world but the women on the TV shows putting makeup on themselves and running around narcissistically.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  And these disassociated, disconnected children, artificial sociopaths brought up like robots,
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  unable to even commune with fellow men and women in kinship and honor.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  Men and women as lovers and as strivers with their families, sons and fathers together in honor,
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  mothers and daughters in grace and strength and honor, all of it is culture moving forward.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  People don't even have knowledge of it, the images of men they put out in Hollywood and television,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  the images they put out of women, what they tell us is great, is a scientific psychological warfare virus
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  injected and poured into our souls, our psyches to deprogram God's basic codex
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  and turn us into manifest, frothing, mindless, empty beast, sacrificed to their evil God of anti-human, anti-liberty,
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  devil-inspired, disease-ridden, stinking, dishonorable failure.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  It's a spiritual choice. You do not want to join with the New World Order.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  You do not want to give it sucker. You do not want to aid and abet it.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  You do not want to be part of it. You do not want to be in it.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  We have to build a better world starting with ourselves, with God's grace and guidance, leading, guiding and directing us.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  We have to move forward because you're not going to find it in the big institutions.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  They have almost all been captured or bullied or blackmailed or bludgeoned or killed.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  And the enemy marches forward, but despite that, there is a great hunger for freedom.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  And you think about Ron Paul and how far the Liberty Movement has come because of him and you supporting him.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  As he said, it's just a focal point of freedom.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  And now Ron Paul, who isn't perfect, but is moving forward, and it's an expression of the power of taking action
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  and the power of the individual through free association, linking out and reaching out to others
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  in not a centralized collectivism, but a true collectivism of free will and connection.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  We'll be back.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  Listen up all you preppers and survival enthusiasts.

[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  We should not have as the highest order of what we think is great a bunch of sex craze, drug addict, music people,
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  whether they be black gangbanger people or white trash country singers or rock and roll decadent devil worshipers.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  It shouldn't be the top of the pyramid. It shouldn't be what we worship as our golden calf.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  It should be justice. It should be God. It should be what's good.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  That should be our North Star, where our heart is.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  King David made a lot of mistakes, had friends killed for their wives, but he would always repent for real.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  And had his heart pointed at God. He was a powerful man, so he had powerful flesh.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  What do you think people that are powerful, powerful and love God don't have all the same stuff evil people have?
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  They usually have more. Maybe a little secret.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  All of you that are into evil that you're getting power out of it.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  People that love good, people that are honorable will absolutely in a fight stomp you into the ground.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  Everybody knows it. And they also are probably three times more wicked inside their mind.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  And that's why they're trying to be good because they've also just got this big evil side.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  They got an even bigger good side. And that's what King David had.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  And that's what it comes down to is where is your heart pointed?
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  What do you want to do at your core?
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  And are you sorry and ashamed in front of God for the bad things that you even think about?
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  Because if you had that in your heart for new listeners, if more Americans, if more people in the world had that in their heart,
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  our problems would start to end very quickly.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  But we've got to seek God's face and repent.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  As a nation, look how evil we are funding al-Qaeda, aborting babies,
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  shooting everybody up with deadly vaccines and lying about it, setting up death panels,
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  letting the government pass Obamacare, letting the government militarize police.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  All these things. That's our fault.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  Sure, we got conned and maneuver manipulated, but now we know so there's no more excuses.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  And we have to build the icons so that young people know to look up to medical doctors that go against the grain
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  and expose the vaccine horrors or other issues or GMO or people that go to Congress for decades and against the tide, turn the tide.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  I mean, that's what we're talking about.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  Because almost every time you do the right thing for the right reasons over a long period, you win.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  I can't think of times where you don't. That's the big secret.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  That's why evil is so scared of good people getting involved.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Before I end the shower, please don't forget we're lists are supported.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  We try to sell the very best products that promote liberty, that are a win-win-win across the board.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  We have a whole range of Made in America, don't tread on me.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Molan Labe, come and take it, ball caps and t-shirts Made in America, women's apparel, beanie caps, winners coming.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  We got a little bit more of the Molan Labe belt buckles in that we hadn't produced yet.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  When those sell out, they're going to be gone.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  The first two waves did. This is the final. They're all stamped.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  One to 500. We had 250. We just didn't produce because they were behind.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Those are in. Infowarsstore.com or Made in 1776.com.

[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Because we can be censored off other platforms like YouTube and Facebook and have been before.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  So we have our own system as kind of a clearinghouse.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  PrismPlanet.tv.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  And then you pay it forward.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  Within a day, almost everything here on air ends up getting put to the YouTube channels and other places.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  But a lot of that stuff gets censored and things.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  So you are paying to help us then get it out to the public.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  With the seed money to get that done.

[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential fourth hood situation?
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  Is this another fourth flight stage attack to take our seven liberties and put more homeland security?
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  Or sticking our hands down our pants on the streets?
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  And that's what PrismPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrismPlanet.tv

[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  This is Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura fresh off the victory in his lawsuit to clear his name from now confirmed slander libel.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  It was not going to be getting into that today, but he's going to be joining us to cover the waterfront of his take on what's happening in the world.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  So I look forward to that.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  And I will open the phones up for the governor at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  That's why we're having him back.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  So we had Congressman Ron Paul on earlier very powerful interview.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  And there's so much he got into saying we were lied to about 9-11.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  And I'm going to go back and listen to that interview. That was just crazy powerful.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  He got into a whole bunch of stuff that I was like, wow, he just said that. Wow, he just said that.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  I've got to go back and listen to that.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  But always a newsmaking interview always important.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  So former Congressman Ron Paul was on with us.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  There's a bowl of things really concerning me because it is a pandemic in Africa.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  The UN says 1.4 million could end up getting it as many as a million could die.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  Some are saying 5 million.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  I mean, I hope that's not the case.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  But what I'm worried about is a vaccine. I don't trust.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  I don't trust this system.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  North Texas Hospital evaluating patient for potential Ebola exposure.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  That's how the CBS News DFW and saying they show signs of it and came from a country where it was happening.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  Ebola alert US patient zero suspected in Dallas.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  Travel history symptoms suggest infection.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  That's up on infowars.com.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  Ebola outbreak thousands of orphans shunned at least 3,700 children in Guiana, Liberia and Sierra Leone,
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  who have lost one or both parents to Ebola this year face being shunned.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  The UN has said carriers were urgently needed caregivers for these orphans.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  UN has said.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  So again, there's other just amazing news on that front.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  I'm going to go ahead and go to him here because we got him on a little bit early.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  We're going to come back from break.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  I got a bunch of questions that I want to ask Jesse Ventura from Minnesota Governor fresh off his victory.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  Where the Jerry said yes, he was liable to slander.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  We're not going to talk about that a bunch today.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  I want to get into the waterfront of world events and where Jesse thinks the planet is going.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  Jesse, we're going to break in a moment.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  Thanks for coming on, Governor.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  But first off, what are some of the things you want to get to when we come back?
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  Oh, I don't really care, Alex. You know, with you, I'll talk any subject that you pretty much want to talk to me about.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  If you want to talk about the trial, we can talk about the trial, whatever thing you want to discuss, it's fine with me.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  I want to ask you when we come back, in your gut, where you think humanity is going to be in 100 years?
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  Will humanity survive?
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  Don't answer that yet.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  I just want to get your take on it.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  And I want to ask you about your TV show.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  I tell you, I watch it when I can online, but I had three people yesterday.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  Come up to me separately and bring up your TV show and some of the big debates you've been having on it.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  So congratulations having all these other hit TV shows in the establishment media and now having one in cyberspace.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  I think that's the real mark of super success you could dominate in cyberspace.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  Well, Alex, all I can say is this show I'm doing right now is my favorite one I've ever done.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  Because of the fact that there's no FCC regulations, nobody hovers over me or a dot TV.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  I'm the boss.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  I mean, I talk about anything that I want to talk about and it's wonderful.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  That's all I could say.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  I'm so content doing this show.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  I don't even want to do anything else.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  I remember you were driving off with Kinky Friedman about eight years ago when I first met you.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  It's got to be longer than that.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  I was in San Antonio, we did an interview and as you were getting in the car, I said,
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  Governor, wait till you finally do your own thing on the Internet.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  That's when you're going to have your most fun.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  I don't know if you remember me saying that to you.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  I don't recall it because everything was moving so fast and I'll take your word for it.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  I just remember that because I knew you were made for the Internet where you could just be unfiltered.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  We're going to come back and talk about the show so much more.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  And at the bottom of the hour, take phone calls, wildcard.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Anything you want to ask the governor, Jesse the Mind Ventura, freshly vindicated in his lawsuit.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  It was all pure bull. It never happened. He told the truth.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  DNA Fourth.

[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time. Just one of the key compounds, BIO-PQQ,
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  DNA Fourth.

[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  At the same time, the restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  They are never going to stop. They are never going to deviate from their program.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  Until we stop them.

[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  Sight is the primary input to the brain.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  Arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies,

[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  I love powerful broadcasts and I think we had one of the most powerful interviews with Ron Paul earlier
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  where he came out and said they lied about 9-11.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  The 28 pages where he dropped a bunch of other big bombshells.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  I love to see Ron Paul getting more hardcore.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  And now we got somebody who's always hardcore and will always tell you what he really thinks.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  You know, there's probably 10% of things that Jesse Ventura believes that I don't agree with.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  I could care less because he says what he really thinks.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  He's honorable. He doesn't lie. He's the real deal.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  Everything he's ever told me he's done.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  Everything he's ever told me he's turned out to be true.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  And as you get older you learn what a rare thing that is.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  Not again kissing his butt, but we were talking about honor in the last hour and being honorable.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  And how really that's the most valuable thing you can have in this world.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  It's kind of like Tony Montana says in Scarface, there's only two things I got in this world
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  and that's my word and my wavos and I won't break them for anybody.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  And so that's why I really love Jesse Ventura because he is the real McCoy, a real-life John Wayne character.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  Jesse, it's great to have you here with us, Governor.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  Great to be on again, Alex. It's fall and of course I don't know when I'll head across the grid again
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  because you know my second home down there was really devastated.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  And I want to make a correction so that people understand that our mainstream media really doesn't do their homework.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  Baja was not hit by a hurricane. Baja was hit by a typhoon.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  That's right. It's in the Pacific.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  Yes, a hurricane is only in the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  A typhoon is in the Pacific Ocean, but mainstream media seems to have lost sight of that fact
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  because I know that from being in the Navy.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  I was taught that in the United States Navy that in the Pacific it's a typhoon, but getting back to Baja, it was devastated.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  And what bothers me is you don't even hear about it on the news.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  All they do is make life stories like, oh, a bachelorette party was interrupted by the hurricane that hit Baja.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  They don't realize that place was devastated just like Katrina devastated New Orleans.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  And they are our brothers and sisters to the South.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  Why aren't we helping them instead of worrying about waging war in the Middle East?
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  There, I've gotten off my pulpit.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  No, I'm glad you brought that up because I remember watching the news and it just clicked.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  I didn't even catch that when Baja was getting smashed by a typhoon.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  I mean, you learn that in like seventh grade or whatever when they have a little bit of meteorology in science class
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  that hurricanes are in the Atlantic, typhoons are in the Pacific, typhoons rotate the opposite direction.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  They can get up to 100 miles an hour faster.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  I mean, and I remember meteorologists on the news calling it a hurricane.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  That had to be on purpose, Jesse.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  No, I don't know if it's on purpose.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  I just think it's ignorance.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  I just think that they are not that deep into it anymore and that that word has overtaken, that hurricane's overtaken typhoon.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  It's really here nor there, but the main thing is this, Alex, is why aren't we helping these people down there?
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  I don't see anything on television.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  I don't see anybody coming forward and saying, you know, there's devastation.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  These people have lost everything down there, a lot of them.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  I mean, I'm fortunate I've gotten word that my house is restricted.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  You know, I live off the grid though.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  The cities are the places that have really been nailed down there.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  And all the people in this country that enjoy vacationing down there, they enjoy the life down there.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  Come on, step up to the plate and let's look to support the Red Cross and other things that are needed down in the Baja very badly right now.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  Yeah, there hadn't really been a lot of coverage of that, but I know what happened.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  They let it pass right by and all hummed it and that's all you hear from it, you know.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  You know, now that I think about it, that's pretty rare for the West Coast to get hit by a typhoon.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  And it's strange that they didn't talk more about that.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Well, they certainly haven't done anything with it, you know, as far as relief or anything like that.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  The word I'm getting though is that the people are being vigilant, they're doing great down there.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  And I've lived there for now eight years and I have no doubt in my mind, of course, they're going to survive it.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  There's survivors down there.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  They don't worry about what Wall Street's doing today.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  They worry about, am I going to have food at my table tomorrow?
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  You know, it's much more prevalent than what Wall Street's doing, but it's a lifestyle.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  I love Alex there.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  I'm off my thing now.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  But anyway, let's move on to something I want to talk about.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  I find it astounding, Alex, that the Republicans, and you know I'm an equal opportunity disliker of both parties,
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  but I find it astounding the hypocrisy of the Republicans now accusing the Democrats of falling asleep at the wheel with ISIS.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  Excuse me, weren't they in charge when 9-11 occurred?
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  And weren't they in charge when we invaded Iraq and created all of this disruption and instability over there?
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  Here's my belief, Alex.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  They knew all along there was going to be an ISIS.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  All this stuff has been done on purpose to support the military industrial complex and our war economy,
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  which is what operates the United States of America today.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  We're an economy war-based.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  Well, Governor, I totally agree with you, and for four years they've been funding them to attack the Syrian government.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  They've killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  Almost all the fighters are al-Qaeda.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  They just renamed it to ISIS.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  They gave them 600 tons of weapons, as Senator Rand Paul exposed.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  And now they're saying, give up your rights, al-Qaeda.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  ISIS is about to kill you any minute when it's our own government in NATO that armed them.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  This has got to be the biggest war forever.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  I don't know how they're getting away with it.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Well, one of the things they're doing is what I pointed out on my show.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  They've got this new bomber now, the F-22 Raptor or something.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  And it's leading the airstrikes over there.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  Well, they cost $150 million apiece.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  And, you know, they got to see if they worked, Alex.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  This is all part of the military industrial war machine.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  And as soon as ISIS is destroyed, that's for sure another named enemy will appear on the horizon over there.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  I mean, we've gone through al-Qaeda.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  We've gone through who is it with the Taliban.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  And now we've got ISIS.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  Well, as soon as they get rid of ISIS, they'll have some other fancy game for another group over there.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  My position is let's get the hell out of there.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  Oh, they've already created Coruscant. They've already got Coruscant out.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Yeah, there you go. So they get the fourth one on the horizon now.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  You know, I don't agree with everything Ronald Reagan did.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  I don't put Ronald Reagan on the pedestal that the Republicans do.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  But the one thing I did agree with him, way back when they attacked our Marine barracks in Lebanon
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  and they killed literally 200 brave Marines serving in that foreign country in Lebanon,
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  did Ronald Reagan avenge and go to war?
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  No, he got the hell out of there.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  He did what they would call today cutting and running.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  Well, sometimes it's better to be prudent than to strike back and revenge right away.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  And right now, in my opinion, the best thing this country could do is get the hell out of the middle.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  I've said it before. Let's go back to Columbus.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  Remember Christopher Columbus, the guy who allegedly discovered the New World for the Anglo-Saxon European?
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  What was he doing? He was on a mission to find an alternative route to India
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  because he didn't want to go through the Middle East.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  Now, if Columbus was willing to defy science, because at that point they said the world was flat
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  and you'd fall off the end of the earth, Columbus didn't care.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  He was willing to fall off the end of the earth not to go through the Middle East.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  Now, that was five, six, seven hundred years ago. Why haven't we learned from it?
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  You're right. And look, the big corporations, they just want a place to drop bombs
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  and make trillions of dollars, trillions in the Iraq and Afghan wars of the last 13 years.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  We've been bombing Iraq. Alex, it's all about the war culture of America today
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  and supporting our military industrial complex because I guarantee you,
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  as soon as they put down ISIS, there will be another enemy on the horizon.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  You've already mentioned that new one they got.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  It's incredible and it's so formulaic.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  I had Ron Paul on earlier and he's come out in support of Walter Jones and Congress's bill
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  for at least the 28 pages. I've talked to Jones and others.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  It does say clearly, even in the Commission's report, that Saudi Arabia was involved
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  and that basically a stand down was ordered. And Ron Paul basically said,
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  yeah, we've been lied to about 9-11. Well, you've been saying that for eight, nine years.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  I've been saying that since it happened.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  But I think that's a good thing, though, that more and more of this is coming out
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  and even the New York Post that's been a group demonizing anybody that talks about 9-11,
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  being staged or being covered up. They now have come out and said that there's a cover-up.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  What do you make of that?
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  Well, certainly, you know, I had Congressman Jones on my show and I was astounded.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  I mean, I thought I was talking to someone in the Twilight Zone.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  Because the exact things he was saying is the things you and I and all of us have been harping on
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  for almost a decade now. And I was astounded and I warned him.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  I said, aren't you fearful of repercussions that they're going to come after you with a sledgehammer?
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  You know, and he didn't feel that way. And I'm all for it because he point blank told me.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  He said these 28 redacted pages, he's read them, they have nothing to do with national security, nothing.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  So there's no reason they should be redacted.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  He said all they do is create a money trail that shows that the Saudis were the finances behind 9-11.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  And I bet if you continue that money trail, lo and behold, it could even report back to this country in some way, shape or form.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  Well, have you ever become president? I hope you put Walter Jones in your cabinet because he's a very honorable person.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  But he doesn't get all the attention Ron Paul does.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  Well, he's still elected in there. And so people need to pay attention to this guy because as much as I admire Dr. Paul,
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  Dr. Paul is now a civilian like me. And once you're a civilian, you have no power in the government.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  Right now, Congressman Jones is in that government, so therefore he has the power of what it's worth of actually still being in there.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  That's right. We're getting him on next week.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  All right, Governor Jesse.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  For how long you'll be there? I don't know.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  We got a supporting. All right, coming back. Jesse Ventura, former Minnesota governor fighting to promote liberty and a great awakening.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:07.000]  Hey, Boomer. I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water. Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  It's the cleanest, best water ever. Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.

[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:26.000]  The strength new nascent iodine formula is here. Survival Shield X2. Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:34.000]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients and completely vegan.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  On screen are Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation, pure, clean and sourced from deep within the Earth.

[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  The total amount of debt in the US has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  The two big to fail banks are much larger and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street Casino and start a cash flowing international business of your own.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  The crash is coming. Take measures now to soften the landing.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789. That's babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  It's also perfect for chainsaws, tractors and other small gas engines.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  Use spare fuel alone or mix it with any amount of regular gasoline to extend the supply of gas you do have on hand.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  Spare fuel is absolutely essential for unforeseen emergencies.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:43.000]  Store spare fuel in your vehicle's trunk or cargo bay and use it in case you run out of gas on the highway.
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is also safe to store with your other supplies and it can be stored for many, many years.

[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest. We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  This popular online TV show is attracting big crowds.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  And again, we'll tweet out the link at RealAlex Jones on Twitter as well.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  But going back to the governor in this short segment, we're going to open the phones up in the next segment for any question or comment.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  We don't censor your calls. We just ask that it's a quick question or a comment for the governor, not a diatribe like I would do.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  Now, this is a short segment, Governor. I want to get into the police state with you.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  In your TV shows, you've warned about it for years. I've been talking about it forever. Armored vehicles, MRAPs being delivered to public schools, NSA spying.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  It's all for the American people.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  Now, we learned in Albuquerque where earlier this year, they shot that unarmed homeless man and let a dog chew on his dead body.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  That as the police drove up the hill, we have the clip, they said, quote, I'm going to shoot him right in the male member, says Cop before executing him.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  Here's another headline today. Florida woman arrested for possession of SpaghettiOs.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  Cop sees car and then tells when the man says get a warrant, they say, we're going to seize your car for exercising your rights.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  I mean, it stacks of this. And I'm not just bashing police themselves, but the system is definitely trying to turn our police into something out of the running man.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  I mean, they're trying to turn the police into the character you played in that hit Schwarzenegger film. Your take on that.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  Well, you know, it's funny you say that, Alex, because I did an interview on my show and this interview, we brought up the running man again.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  I mean, I'm hearing more and more talk out there about the running man and people need to understand the film I did with Arnold the running man.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  It's written by Richard Bachman, who in reality was Stephen King.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  Now, I have all the respect in the world for Stephen King. He's a phenomenal writer, but I do not want to live in a world of Stephen King's imagination.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  And that's what the running man was. Stephen King's look at the future and the use of his imagination.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  Well, he's too bizarre for the reality of the world. Bless him for what he does entertaining us, but I don't want to live in a Stephen King world.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  And that's the way we're heading towards the running man. I mean, we discovered that the TSA eventually down the line is going to get airplane travelers these wristbands.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  They will have all your vitals on it with my show conspiracy theory. That was the episode they wouldn't allow on.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  We found out they were going to use these wristbands and everybody jump on board. Oh, I got the wristband all my vitals. That's all I could have.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  What they weren't going to tell you is that that wristband would be commissioned you like a taser.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  Yes. Everyone wearing them. So anyone in the airport could be dropped to the floor in convulsions if you're wearing these things.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  And you know, much the same as the running man. If you remember when Arnold escaped, he had the thing around his neck and he had to have it taken off by Nick Fleetwood.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  Otherwise, they could activate it. It would blow his head off. And so, you know, we're heading that direction.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  Sure. And people better wake up for the fact that our police is supposed to be a reflection of us. They are not to be the military.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  Our police are turning far more military today than to be a reflection of society. And I'm against having all these armored vehicles.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  I'm against all these policemen who look like stormtroopers now. They even wear the Nazi-like looking helmets.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  You can't even see their faces. They come up. And I understand police is a dangerous job.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  But if you look at the statistics, I believe there's at least 10 other jobs that are more dangerous. Am I right on that?
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  Yes. And most cops get killed in car wrecks. And it's all for intimidation. It's all federally worldwide the police are going to this model under the Rand Corporation.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  It's an admitted plan to basically take over countries. They call it a national stabilization force. That sounds like something out of the running man as well.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  Oh, yeah. Very much so. And it's ridiculous. And it's time that we... You know, I don't know how many times, Alex, I could tell people the only way out of this is to stop voting for Democrats and Republicans.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  I mean, I'm sick of saying it because nobody bothers to listen and they keep electing them over and over again. You know, they're like the mouse on the treadmill.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  They can't get off. And until our populace can get off the treadmill, this is what we're going to face.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  You're right. Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest. And if we'll put him back up on screen, you go to aura.tv forward slash off the grid.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  We just type in Jesse Ventura off the grid into search engine. It comes right up. You can find us Facebook, Twitter, and you can also find the censored shows from his conspiracy theory show on YouTube.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  They're always taking them down, but folks are putting them back up.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  I want to talk about web censorship that you govern when we come back because the inventor of the Internet, not Al Gore, but the real one.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  So there's an attempt to end the Internet because, yeah, the system can't compete with my show and your show.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  So what do you expect him to do to try to shut us down straight ahead with Jesse Ventura, your phone calls, and more?
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2. Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions found more than 7000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan. We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:31:01.000]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:13.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.

[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  All right, your phone calls are coming up for former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. We were just speaking about 1984 and the running man.
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  Thailand considers tracking tourists with GPS bracelets after banning Orwell's 1984 being sold in the country. Thailand, which began arresting citizens last summer for reading copies of George Orwell's 1984, is now considering tracking tourists with GPS devices.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  Thailand's Tourism and Sports Minister, I won't try to pronounce this name, Kabakan Watanaga Vakarl, said the government is working with hotels and resorts to assign ID wristbands, including serial numbers of tourists, for future plans including GPS tracking.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  As he first, it comes out with the bracelet and then they train you for it. The next step will be some sort of electronic device that would not yet be discussed in detail, he told Reuters. So that story just went up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  Before we get into some of the other issues, Jesse, and where you think the world's going and the attempts to censor the internet that I was just mentioning before the break, your court case.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  You know, I follow the news and there's still just a steady demonization campaign, kind of like when you were in Minnesota, they said you got pulled over by the cops at the airport starting fights and you were in Minnesota when that happened and came on the show and said I'm in Minnesota, not true.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  Fox News reported that first. Then they said right when you drove into Mexico that you'd been running around saying you were glad Navy Seals were dead and it had been beaten up.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  Of course, none of that was true. Now proven in court. And then now I tune in. I mean, I just see stuff. Jesse Ventura's glad Seals are dead. Jesse Ventura attacks widow when her insurance paid for it.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  I mean, what were you supposed to do? I mean, it's news core. I'm not even attacking news core. I don't have a dog in the fight, but you're my friend. It's not true.
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  News core published the book and so they never tell people that they just sit there. They really have it out for you. Why do you think that is?
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  Well, you know, they won't have me on either to allow me to defend myself. I cannot go on Fox News. We've tried on multiple occasions. They won't get the trash me continually.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  Well, I'm a danger to them. And it's also because they have a major conflict of interest. News core owns both Harper Collins and Fox News.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  So if I win a lawsuit against Harper Collins, that's money out of Fox News's pocket, you know, up the corporate ladder.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  So they're being dishonest with the public and not telling them that they have a major conflict of interest and that they are with the Harper Collins book that I might have made $40 million off that book.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  Now they paid me. Now let's go to the estate for a moment. I've been accused of going after the widow and her children. Well, it's not true.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  You cannot find one legal document that says I went after Taya Kyle, the widow. I sued Chris Kyle. Chris Kyle tragically died.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  Well, then it's standard procedure. The lawsuit ships from the person to the person's estate. Taya Kyle, the wife came in and became the executive of this estate by choice.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  She knew the lawsuit was there. She knew it was pending and she chose to become part of it because the executive to an estate can be a lawyer.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  It can be an uncle. It can be anybody. The state approves it. She wanted it. She chose to do it. So she became the executive of the state and entered into the lawsuit.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  Now, everything on her end was covered by insurance. She didn't have to pay for the big table of lawyers. She wasn't even involved in settlement talks.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  The last settlement talk, they wanted to leave her in Texas. She didn't even have to come up to be part of it from their side.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  But yet the media continues to portray me like, who's the little guy on CNN who said, have I no shame?
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  Anderson Cooper and Fox News continues to say, well, witnesses showed that none of these people were ever in the courtroom, Alex.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  No, no, they just got fake witnesses that they pulled out of their, you know what?
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Exactly. When they talk about any evidence in this case, they're making it up because they were not in the courtroom.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  I agree. They lost the case. They lost the case and I tune in and they act like you lost.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  Well, and they make it look like somehow the jury was wrong and then how could the jury get it wrong? The jury was not wrong.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  The evidence was so overwhelming that he never hit me. We never had a confrontation and the whole thing was fabricated.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  Well, it's ridiculous. You're not going to go in a Navy SEAL bar where you're friends with the owner for a commencement and then say you're glad SEALs are dead and obviously getting a big fight.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  I mean, it's just, plus I know you, you're all about not getting in confrontations and all about being nice in public. It's just pure, absolute crap.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  Yeah, and when it came out that way, but again, Fox News, even to this day, continues to make it look like I'm guilty.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  And as I said, it never happened. The jury heard evidence and then they get on me because they awarded me 1.84 million.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  Well, most of that's going to go to my attorneys and I didn't ask for that. That's what the jury awarded me.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  That is the jury, what they did.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  Governor Bill O'Reilly, we played the clip. I'm going to play it again.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  Had a thing about cyber stalking women on the internet and sex crimes and cut to a clip of my face yelling and had my face turned red and said, we've got to ban the hate.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  And my lawyer said, no, clearly that's that's an attempt to defame you. You could win it, but it would cost millions and take years. Well, just like you've had to do.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  MSNBC said the Boston bombers were influenced by me to blow stuff up with no evidence.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  So the question is, why are they doing dirty tricks on you? Dirty tricks on me. They've been doing it to Rand Paul as well.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  Have a Democrats dress up like Klan members and show up at his events. Luckily, we caught them. It's because they've got our phones tapped.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  None of us are perfect, but they know we're real and they're scared of anybody who might ever tell the truth.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  So they're trying to assassinate our character.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  Yeah, exactly. We're considered, I guess, their rival. We were not in their court. We're not in what they're trying to do.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  So naturally, we are the enemy. And so they're fortunate to have the power of the media in their back pocket who can then continue to portray us.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  I mean, Alex, I love it how they portray me as some odd, like I'm out of my mind in a wild man.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  You know, that people believe I'm out of control of all this. You've met me. I'm always, I'm never out of control.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  It's so laughable, you kind of chuckle over the way they try to portray me in the media.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  Let me tell you a story. I'll tell you how not dumb, but not paying attention to the public is.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  Every time Hulk Hogan gets in trouble, I get emails or on the street or my neighbors come over or if I'm at a party and they go,
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  hey, your buddy Jesse Ventura got caught in a sex tape. Hey, your buddy Jesse Ventura, you know, just got divorced and his son just wrecked a car.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  And I go, no, that's Hulk Hogan. Jesse Ventura is all about being in control of his life.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  And they go, no, whatever, cover up for your friend. So it's almost like an Americana to be ignorant.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  You know, oh, a sod gets attacked by Al Qaeda. We fund them and then we blame a sod.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  I mean, it's like a religion of being ignorant in America. I'm not trying to be mean here, but I have experienced it with you.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  You don't look like Hulk Hogan. You've got dark hair. He's got blonde hair. I guess you're both big guys. You were rivals.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  So how does, look, if I've seen this myself, am I right? Or have you experienced being blamed for Hulk Hogan?
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  Well, I've been blamed for him a few times and I don't know. Maybe he's been blamed for me too. I have no idea on that.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  But there was a time that we both had bleach blonde hair and we were both big wrestlers.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  And so, you know, it doesn't bother me that I can get mistaken for him at times. I don't care about that.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  But it does bother me though, if he does something and I get the blame for it, if he does something that's not particularly too good,
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  you know, people should have a common sense to be able to distinguish the two.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  But then again, mistakes can be made. But what's happening with our media is not mistakes.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  Exactly. Well, they're playing on the public's ignorance.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  I mean, they're, yeah. And that's what they do. They play on the public's ignorance and they always make me out to be some out of control guy.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  And now, because I did an entertainment show called Conspiracy Theory, allegedly I have no credibility and he's one of those conspiracy dots.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  Well, people need to also remember, nine out of ten times when the government gives you their story, it is likewise a conspiracy theory.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  It's only a theory what they're telling you because it's never backed up with any hard evidence.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  They just tell you their side of the story. But yet, and I love too, Alex, how today they've morphed the word truth into being bad.
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  If you're called a truth or today, something's wrong with you. You're out of control. You're a crazy person.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  So by the opposite thought, you mean liar is now good. You know, I don't get this. Truth used to stand for something.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  And they've morphed it today into truth being bad.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  Well, I don't think it's working.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  Like that we have to overcome.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  I don't think it's working. Congress has a 7% approval rating.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  I want to go to Carl's governor. But first off, go back to that question in your gut with your son, your daughter, your whole life.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  Do you think humanity is going to make it and survive?
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  And we've got the West clearly in the wrong trying to start a war with Russia.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  And I'm not even defending Putin. It's just clearly starting to fight in my view.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  I don't think, I think all of it's planned and it's all a big stair tactic like what Elfletcher Crowdy said at the end of World War Two how all wars would now be fought in third world nations and they would be fought to where the military would have no direct objective to achieve where they could claim victory.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  And every war has been that. So I tend to believe what Colonel Crowdy said because the proofs of the pudding is what's happened.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  And I think all these wars are done on purpose as really a distraction and again to fulfill an economy that is war based.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  They have to keep us at war now. We have to keep making these planes. We have to keep making these implements a war.
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  So until we change our culture, this is what we're going to get.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  Now, can we change our culture? Certainly.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  But it starts with electing the right people and electing Democrats and Republicans.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  They're going to get it done. So until we break the stranglehold of the two parties on our government, there's no hope for us.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  I agree with you, but in your gut, where do you see this country going?
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  I don't know. The new millennium kids give me hope because they're not watching television.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  The average viewer of Fox News is 72 or 73, which means they're going to be dying shortly.
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  So that could be the end of Fox News when all the people that watch them are dead from old age.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  So I think Alex, with the new millennials, if they'll not fall victim like we did in the 60s, the war ended in Vietnam and we became part of the cultural system then.
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  We didn't stay separate from it. I'm hoping that the new millennials will learn from this that they will break away from the status quo and, for lack of better term, continue to do their own thing because their wars have been ongoing the whole time.
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  So it's not, it doesn't compare directly to Vietnam. And they're smart kids. They got the internet and the internet right now is uncontrollable, but rest assured the government will do their best to control it.
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  Well, they can't compete with us. I mean, CNN's collapsing. They're all collapsing. We're exploding. Ron Paul's got his own channel reaching millions. I mean, it's really an exciting time.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  And I would encourage all the viewers and listeners, go out and do your own thing as well. Also support our local M&M affiliates because that's a precious way to reach people.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  Let's go ahead and talk. Let's take some calls, Gov. Let's talk to Tim in Florida. You're on the air.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  Oh, I just want to say real quick, Jesse, the body venturer, you've always been a big fan. And real quick, you know, every time they've ever showed a video of them, Islamic beheading anybody, they never wore any mask and there was never no break.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  So the ones that I'm, my argument is they never, they stopped in the middle and then they never sewed the bodies with the actual.
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  That's a good question. I mean, we know they put out fixed up before. How can you believe any of it?
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  Well, another thing to remember too, people, that's what they do over there. The Saudi Arabian government has beheaded people. That's what they do.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  See, I oppose all capital punishment. What's the difference if you're beheading somebody or putting them in a toaster or injecting them with a chemical that doesn't work half the time that we do here?
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  Capital punishment, still capital punishment. I disagree with it vehemently that shouldn't exist on the planet.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  Well, I'm for capital punishment in the village.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  I'm not.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  Well, let me just go back briefly and get your take on this. Go back to the village and half the village sees somebody strangle a kid. The village would go beat the guy to death. That's natural justice.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  But you can't trust a corrupt state that's been caught framing innocent people. I mean, some estimates are half of death row are innocent.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  So you can't trust a system like that to meet out the death penalty, whether it's North Korea or the United States. What do you say to that?
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  Well, my belief is this, Alex, we may differ a little. Here I am, the atheist who doesn't believe in the death penalty. Imagine that.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  But for all the religious people, thou shalt not kill. There's no asterisk there. It doesn't say, well, except in the case of a murder, if you can put him to death.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  Somebody has to pull that switch. And I've always, I've had shows where I said, who's more powerful? God is the government.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  Well, clearly the government's more powerful because the government can kill and there's no repercussions from God.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  Sure.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  So, you know, my position is killing is wrong and so is killing for punishment. That is wrong too. We shouldn't be doing it because somebody has to physically carry out the killing.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  Sure. But the translation just to be clear is thou shalt not commit murder. The King James says kill. I mean, I mean, obviously you would defend yourself if somebody attacked you.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  Well, of course, there's self defense. If it's you dying or the other person's attempting to kill you, that's totally different.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  Let's see one more.
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  I'm talking about having a system. I oppose that.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  No, I get it. It makes sense. Slam.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  Slam. Real fast question.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  Yeah. Slam in Canada. Go ahead.
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  Yep. I'm just calling it regarding, I think it's a lot worse than we think it is personally. This ISIS group that changes their name every five minutes like P. Diddy or whatever the hell his name is right now.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  Pardon my French. And then, you know, with all the stuff going on, the beheadings and those being questionable and I request, I mean, I thank you both for what you're doing.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  But you know, this is weird though. I've never seen calls come in with the same weird point about beheading.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  I'm looking at these calls on screen. A bunch of them are about beheadings. People are, I don't know. Do you guys know each other calling him with this theme?
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  No, no, I'm not. I don't know who that guy was.
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  What's your question real quick? What's your question?
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  I think it's a lot worse. Do you guys agree with me that it's a lot worse than we think it is? I mean, there's a lot of people I think it's worse.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  I don't. I don't anticipate ISIS coming here and invading our country.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  I think, and imagine this, if we hadn't gone into Iraq, took out Saddam Hussein and destabilized the whole region, would there be ISIS if Saddam was in charge?
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  Sure. I agree. I don't think so.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  You're absolutely right, Governor.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  If Saddam Hussein was still in charge of Iraq.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  Or if we hadn't in the last four years given them all these weapons, again, building up the enemy as you said at the start of the interview.
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  And come back real quick, final segment with Jesse Ventura, Pete, Wildman, Todd, George, and others.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  Get ready. We're coming back.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  No joke. Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor. And if House Bill H.R. 5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets. Goodbye. Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer. Go now to infidelbodyarmor.com.

[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years. That means big savings.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:48.000]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water. Get a Big Berkey today at bigberkeywaterfilters.com. GCN listeners receive 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  But they happened. They're still monitoring. You're every move. It's coming.
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  What's coming?
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  Call 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E.
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  In Indiana, Pete, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  What's the point, though?
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  My point is that with the recent beheading of the women in Oklahoma and the people, the sheeple, being prone to imitating what they see on TV or network TV, it's been suggested that we might start seeing IEDs planted by domestic ISIS affiliates, terrorists, whatever you want to call it.
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  Yeah, which is exactly what Homeland Security said they needed martial law for. Good point. Jesse, this whole thing does look scripted.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  Well, it may be, and the point of the matter is this, if we would get out of the Middle East, remember what Osama bin Laden said. He said, you don't see us attacking Norway, do you?
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  If we'd get out of the Middle East, it would all end. The reason they're attacking us is because we're over there occupying them and telling them how to govern themselves.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  Let them govern themselves. Let's get the hell out of there. Columbus didn't want to go there. Why should we go there today?
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  I'll say this, you don't see the al-Qaeda people attacking South America, or you don't see them attacking South Africa because they're not over there, and it's a fake clash of civilizations.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  Todd in Ohio, thanks for calling. Quick question for Ventura.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  Good. We're good. Go ahead.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  I'm a veteran, and I've come home from the military, and I did it, but there are a lot of different propaganda threats going on here in the United States.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  My question and point I want to make is, what happens when we can't wake up the masses and one of these terrorist threats hits? How do we resolve that?
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  Well, we've allegedly been hit on 9-11 by a massive terror attack, and the Republicans were in charge then.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  So the point is this, government can't keep you safe without taking your freedom.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  I would rather have my freedom and take my chances than to be locked up and lose my freedom because they're going to keep me safe.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  I remember a cartoon I saw where it showed mom, dad, and the two kids, and they're all sitting at the dinner table and they go, boy, I feel safe now.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  And the cartoon had them inside a barred cell locked in a cell, but boy, I feel safe now.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  The point is this, freedom is safety, and that's what we need to be striving for is to lock it down America.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  If you lock down America, they win.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  That's right. Notice the annihilation of our freedoms in 13 years, and now Al Qaeda has whole armies to take over.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  Obviously, it doesn't keep us safe. It's being used to take over. That's why our government's arming Al Qaeda.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  This is how you conquer America. Thank you, Todd. I'm sorry the other callers. We're out of time.
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  Governor, I know you're probably not going on a Baja. I'm usually go, I guess, in September or October.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  Well, you never know, Alex. I want to go down there to help, even more than my show.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  I'd like to go down there and give physical help, if I can, because they need the help down there, just like we needed it in New Orleans when Katrina hit.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  Nobody's covering it here in America, and we have our brothers and sisters down there in big trouble in the Baja.
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  Well, I'll tell you what, you've been on the show before via Skype down there, so if you're down there a week or a month, I want to give us a report here.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  We'd love to help off the grid as well. Get some coverage of what's happening down there, Governor.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  Okay, we'll do that, Alex. Thank you, and we'll look forward. I'll talk to you again before I leave.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  You bet. Say hi to your wives and everybody else, and have a great week coming up, Jesse.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  You too. Bye, Alex.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  All right, there goes Jesse. And again, folks, he's just a real guy, and that's why they hate him and want to destroy him.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  All right, folks, tonight, 7 o'clock Central, Info Wars Nightly News, and back tomorrow.
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:48.000]  That's it. Great job, crew, and great job to our affiliates. Great job, Ron Paul. Great job, Ed Group. Great job, Info Wars.
