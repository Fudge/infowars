[00:00.000 --> 00:28.100]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:28.100 --> 00:33.720]  The film White Noise was released on Netflix in September of last year.
[00:33.720 --> 00:41.120]  It's about a train crashing, exploding, and burning toxic chemicals off into the atmosphere,
[00:41.120 --> 00:47.320]  creating a major health hazard for miles around, reflecting what just happened a few weeks ago
[00:47.320 --> 00:48.880]  in Ohio.
[00:48.880 --> 00:57.080]  White Noise was even filmed in the same area, just a few miles from Ground Zero in East Palestine.
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.920]  Some people will call this a coincidence, but these days, believing in coincidence can
[01:02.920 --> 01:04.800]  cost you your life.
[01:04.800 --> 01:06.040]  And there is more.
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.380]  Just three months before the train wreck, the city of East Palestine began adopting the
[01:11.380 --> 01:17.200]  MyID digital bracelet system into their local emergency services.
[01:17.200 --> 01:24.600]  Being touted as the ultimate ID system, MyID is a digital ID company, dealing primarily
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.680]  with digital ID bracelets for the medical industry.
[01:28.680 --> 01:34.760]  Bracelets designed to make it easier for first responders to access your medical profile
[01:34.760 --> 01:37.960]  in the event of an unexpected emergency.
[01:37.960 --> 01:43.160]  And just a week before the crash, they began handing these bracelets out to all the residents
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.960]  of East Palestine.
[01:45.960 --> 01:52.640]  Also two weeks before the crash, the CDC updated their page on vinyl chloride, removing their
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.200]  section on how it affects children, and raising the safe exposure threshold.
[01:58.200 --> 02:05.440]  Neil Donald Walsh wrote, There are no coincidences in the universe, only convergences of will,
[02:05.440 --> 02:08.080]  intent, and experience.
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.760]  Not only does the Ohio train crash appear to be a deliberate attack, it appears to potentially
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.960]  be a very deadly attack.
[02:16.960 --> 02:23.840]  Three days after the train wreck, authorities called for a controlled release burn, controlled
[02:23.840 --> 02:30.000]  in that they would initiate the spark that will burn all the chemicals and cargo together
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.280]  in a massive chemical fire, potentially putting millions of people's lives at risk.
[02:36.280 --> 02:41.800]  The vinyl chloride spill at Camp Lejeune was small in comparison to what happened this
[02:41.800 --> 02:43.480]  month in Ohio.
[02:43.480 --> 02:50.080]  But it still poisoned over a million people, and it took decades for the effects to materialize.
[02:50.080 --> 02:57.840]  A new federal lawsuit against Norfolk Southern alleges that 1.1 million pounds of vinyl chloride
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.680]  was spilled into the local environment.
[03:00.680 --> 03:07.760]  The vinyl chloride metabolite chloroethylene oxide attacks human DNA and can take years
[03:07.760 --> 03:11.880]  to start showing up as cancers and other disease.
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.360]  There is arguably no safe dose for exposure.
[03:16.360 --> 03:23.040]  Leading expert in the study of vinyl chloride, Dr. Julianne Baer, agrees and says that nobody
[03:23.040 --> 03:25.280]  should be drinking the local water.
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.680]  According to Dr. Baer, vinyl chloride gets transported into homes via the groundwater.
[03:31.680 --> 03:37.160]  She says, it comes out of the water, into the air, and that's really the major route
[03:37.160 --> 03:39.280]  of toxicity for the liver.
[03:39.280 --> 03:41.400]  It comes through the air.
[03:41.400 --> 03:47.520]  While some argue that burning it resolved these issues, that seems to be false.
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.600]  Dioxins are the deadly toxins behind Agent Orange and DDT.
[03:52.600 --> 03:58.680]  They are generated when chlorinated chemicals, like vinyl chloride, burn.
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.360]  In fact, the exact reaction that happened in East Palestine when they decided to burn
[04:04.360 --> 04:11.880]  vinyl chloride and PVC pellets together was arguably the most efficient and deadly way
[04:11.880 --> 04:17.960]  of dispersing dioxins into the environment, and could equate to being one of the biggest
[04:17.960 --> 04:21.080]  chemical weapons attacks in history.
[04:21.080 --> 04:26.480]  Some are saying that tens of millions of lives could now be at risk, and that number will
[04:26.480 --> 04:33.160]  keep growing so long as humanity dismisses these attacks as coincidence and continues
[04:33.160 --> 04:35.080]  to do nothing.
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.920]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:37.920 --> 04:44.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday of February 22nd, 2023.
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.800]  We have a huge guest in studio today.
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.800]  I'll tell you about it.
[04:47.800 --> 04:51.920]  When we come back, we obviously have masses of just insane news.
[04:51.920 --> 04:57.560]  My job's gotten a lot easier because the New World Order is in our face, pissing in our
[04:57.560 --> 05:01.240]  face, and we're going to stop them.
[05:01.240 --> 05:03.920]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.800]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny, and
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.800]  that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[05:12.800 --> 05:13.800]  It takes commitment.
[05:13.800 --> 05:19.080]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to infowarsstore.com and buy great products
[05:19.080 --> 05:24.840]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[05:24.840 --> 05:30.120]  Infowarsstore.com, they get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War
[05:30.120 --> 05:36.040]  for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back at Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil
[05:36.040 --> 05:39.760]  we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half
[05:39.760 --> 05:40.760]  off.
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.240]  It's all available at infowarsstore.com, some of the very best products, and a lot of you
[05:45.240 --> 05:46.880]  have never shopped at Infowarsstore.
[05:46.880 --> 05:50.040]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken
[05:50.040 --> 05:52.280]  the step to go to Infowarsstore.
[05:52.280 --> 05:56.440]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[05:56.440 --> 06:21.480]  So again, please take action and go to infowarsstore.com today, and I thank you.
[06:21.480 --> 06:37.400]  All right, it's Wednesday, February 22nd, 2023, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:37.400 --> 06:42.480]  Remember this broadcast was already supposed to already be off the air, very powerful forces
[06:42.480 --> 06:49.040]  including the FBI, the CIA, large corporations, think tanks have been working tirelessly along
[06:49.040 --> 06:53.440]  with the corporate dinosaur media and big tech to shut us down, but because we have
[06:53.440 --> 06:58.280]  we the people, because we have you, because we're together, we are still on air, though
[06:58.280 --> 07:04.520]  battered and embattled, but battle-hardened, and in many ways, more effective and more
[07:04.520 --> 07:06.120]  influential than we've ever been.
[07:06.120 --> 07:11.960]  And I don't just mean myself, but I mean the crew, our guests, our hosts, our reporters,
[07:11.960 --> 07:17.480]  our researchers, this family, and all of you that have kept us on the air over the years
[07:17.480 --> 07:25.000]  and spread the word, you're not a participant in this, you are a MVP, most valuable player,
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.000]  in the fight.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.200]  So let that sink in to your heads when you call in and thank me over and over again.
[07:31.200 --> 07:33.120]  No, I'm thanking you.
[07:33.120 --> 07:35.080]  Let that burn into your head.
[07:35.080 --> 07:37.920]  That's not to butter you up or kiss your ass.
[07:37.920 --> 07:39.680]  You are victory.
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.440]  When you get excited, when you take action, when you're informed, when you've got God
[07:43.440 --> 07:51.920]  on your side, when you're hitting your knees every night, we are unstoppable.
[07:51.920 --> 07:55.960]  World government is now out in the open, and in every pole and study around the world,
[07:55.960 --> 08:00.920]  it's wildly unpopular, and they got dressed down to their face by Elon Musk last week,
[08:00.920 --> 08:01.920]  and more is happening.
[08:01.920 --> 08:05.680]  I monitor the other big talk show hosts, the ones that aren't liberal or conservative,
[08:05.680 --> 08:10.440]  but are, quote, middle of the road, and it's not just Joe Rogan, the majority of them are
[08:10.440 --> 08:14.680]  turning against the establishment and turning against the globalists because they realize
[08:14.680 --> 08:22.720]  their own interest to live in a quasi-free, successful country or world are in trouble.
[08:22.720 --> 08:26.040]  Big article on this out of Vanity Fair yesterday, I don't have time to get to, but I'll cover
[08:26.040 --> 08:27.040]  it more today.
[08:27.040 --> 08:33.080]  Now, I've known about this guy for over a decade, I mean, hell, back to the Iraq War.
[08:33.080 --> 08:39.280]  This is the second one, so I guess hard to believe that's 20 years ago, 2003, and producers
[08:39.280 --> 08:40.280]  are great.
[08:40.280 --> 08:43.680]  They're great guests, and I've asked a few times, say, get Michael Yon on, for some
[08:43.680 --> 08:45.440]  reason never happened.
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.600]  I knew he lived in Texas, he lives outside Austin, Dripping Springs, and then, boom,
[08:49.600 --> 08:52.760]  here he came, walking through the door here, stayed at home with Mike Adams.
[08:52.760 --> 08:56.000]  So I said, well, you please, and your busy schedule will come on for two hours tomorrow,
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.800]  and he obliged, saying he'd want to get on the show for years, so, well, we're gonna
[09:00.800 --> 09:03.640]  be as happy as two peas in a pod here.
[09:03.640 --> 09:08.760]  This guy has seen it all, long history and special forces, then as a journalist, as a
[09:08.760 --> 09:14.600]  pro, a human activist, just, man, this two hours, second and third hour, are gonna go
[09:14.600 --> 09:20.160]  by so quick with Michael Yon in studio, he spent a lot of time last year over in the
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.440]  Netherlands, where it's the front line of the globalist assault to shut down farmers
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.360]  when the Dutch are the third biggest food producers in the world, will cause mass starvation,
[09:30.360 --> 09:33.680]  not there, but around the world, it's just, we're gonna cover everything.
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.680]  World War III, the Ukraine situation with Michael Yon, a super smart, super humble guy,
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.600]  and he's gonna be with us, talking about information war and more, then fourth hour
[09:44.600 --> 09:52.440]  hosted by the mighty, amazing, dynamic, you know it's true, Drew Hernandez, such a brain,
[09:52.440 --> 09:58.240]  and such a fiery speaker, he's got it all, he is gonna be hosting the fourth hour, and
[09:58.240 --> 10:01.840]  I tell you, I sleep better at night, knowing there are the Drew Hernandez's, there are
[10:01.840 --> 10:07.560]  the Chris Skies, there are the Tucker Carlson's, there are the Carl Rittenhouse's of the world,
[10:07.560 --> 10:11.320]  speaking of Carl Rittenhouse, the guy that admits he chased him down with a gun and pointed
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.040]  it at him with an intent to shoot him, is suing him for shooting him in the arm.
[10:17.040 --> 10:21.640]  Talk about incredible control that Carl Rittenhouse showed, because if you're aiming the gun at
[10:21.640 --> 10:26.080]  me and knocking me down on the ground or pointing it at me, I'm gonna shoot you in the chest.
[10:26.080 --> 10:31.920]  Rittenhouse basically blew half the guy's arm off to disarming, that is Obi-Wan Kenobi level
[10:31.920 --> 10:35.800]  stuff, doesn't kill the guy, just cuts the arm off, getting sued and they think they'll
[10:35.800 --> 10:41.480]  get a judge and elect this venue and might win, but it's better to be tried by nine and
[10:41.480 --> 10:49.080]  carried by six as they say, we'll be covering more of that, look, there's a lot I didn't
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.200]  get to yesterday, a lot I got to cover today, we're gonna jam it all into this hour, then
[10:53.200 --> 10:58.480]  intersperse more with our guests in the second, third hour ahead of the amazing Drew Hernandez,
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.200]  but let me explain how I operate, because the politicians don't get this, the power
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.440]  structure doesn't get it, most of the audience gets it, but some people don't.
[11:08.440 --> 11:12.480]  And they think Jones must be working for some special interest group, Jones must have some
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.840]  special funding, Jones must be taking orders from somebody, no, I'm just like a grassroots
[11:18.840 --> 11:25.720]  activist, I take orders from my own research and where God leads guides and directs me.
[11:25.720 --> 11:32.320]  And so, I don't wanna throw the baby out with the bathwater with Trump, the system legitimately
[11:32.320 --> 11:38.960]  hates his guts, he legitimately got elected, he legitimately called the shots himself or
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.040]  tried to, and presidents really since they took out Nixon, this is admitted in PhD level
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.600]  political science, are puppets of these council on foreign relations, corporate round table
[11:50.600 --> 11:56.000]  committee of 300 groups, he said well which is it, the club of Rome, the Debo's group,
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.920]  the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, there's like 20 dudes, they're all men, almost all
[12:02.920 --> 12:08.160]  old white men, maybe one Asian person, there's one black guy that you know is in one of the
[12:08.160 --> 12:14.880]  high level boards as well, but the point is, is that they're the ones pushing all the racial
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.040]  division and white people are bad, when meanwhile there are a bunch of old white men running
[12:19.040 --> 12:26.360]  this thing, and people ask well what is the most powerful group, it's 20 guys or less
[12:26.360 --> 12:32.280]  that sit as the chairman and the directors and the presidents and the heads of all of
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.080]  these globalist organizations, more than 100 of them, and that's what the Rockefellers
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.880]  really did a really good job of in an evil way in the last 100 years, was setting up
[12:40.880 --> 12:47.320]  over 100 national and international boards that they then give endless funding to, to
[12:47.320 --> 12:52.640]  get their people put into positions of power in the bureaucracy, in the military, in industry,
[12:52.640 --> 12:57.280]  in banking and academia and government, and that's why when Schwab talks about, it penetrates
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.200]  the cabinets, they've got a bunch of globalist organizations that will have hundreds or thousands
[13:02.200 --> 13:07.680]  of members depending on the group, but there's only about 20 people that had them, in fact
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.840]  if you look at the main groups, there's four or five guys that are on more than half of
[13:11.840 --> 13:17.680]  the directorships, so it's four or five guys that, that, that are the chairman of the boards
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.840]  of those groups, and then you've got another 15 or so that help them, so we're talking
[13:21.840 --> 13:28.680]  about 20 people that run these things, and man they are eugenicists, they are transhumanists,
[13:28.680 --> 13:34.160]  they are anti-Christians, they are promoting pedophilia, when you see all the pedophilia
[13:34.160 --> 13:40.680]  and all the corruption and all the evil, it's them, so is Trump pigheaded, does Trump have
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.520]  big blind spots, absolutely, does Trump convince himself something's the right thing to do and
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.720]  then never admit he's wrong, yeah, that's a powerful attribute against the globalist,
[13:49.720 --> 13:57.400]  but it's also a powerful problem when he's wrong because he will not listen and he cannot
[13:57.400 --> 14:03.240]  be turned around, case in point, the poison shots, that said when we come back, I've
[14:03.240 --> 14:07.360]  been weighing who's better, to Santas or Trump, and I've been openly throwing my support
[14:07.360 --> 14:12.280]  to Trump or to Santas when one of them does the right thing, because we have leverage,
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.920]  all of us have leverage, on Congress, on these leaders, on these corporate leaders, to put
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.640]  pressure on them, putting pressure on McCarthy to put out the January 6th video, now he says
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.520]  it's coming out in about a week and a half, Tucker's already been giving access to it,
[14:25.520 --> 14:29.800]  so we have power, they don't want us to use it, that's why they censor us, so I haven't
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.320]  thrown Trump out with the bathwater, I've been very critical to try to put pressure
[14:34.320 --> 14:37.840]  on him to do the right thing to save lives and stop the poison shot, but without Trump
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.760]  we're already doing that together, getting past the censors and working really hard,
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.760]  we've done an amazing job, you've done an amazing job, that's it, when the Santas came
[14:46.760 --> 14:50.760]  out hardcore against the poison shots and his criminal investigations going, I said,
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.760]  okay, he just went up in the scales against Trump, he's a couple points ahead, I give
[14:56.760 --> 15:02.240]  it 52 to 48, the Santas right now, in my heart, in my mind, who I think is better because
[15:02.240 --> 15:08.680]  I judge a tree by the fruits, Trump has aggressively, the last few months, been hammering this
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.400]  war, calling the globalist war mongers, explaining it's World War 3, and really trying to rally
[15:14.400 --> 15:20.000]  people against the war, when nobody at his level is doing it, not the Santas, not really
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.240]  any of them, Rand Paul's been somewhat critical, but not much, Trump, with his anti-World War
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.200]  3 stance, but believe me, he's dangerous to take, with the power he's got, just pushed
[15:32.200 --> 15:38.360]  him way ahead of the Santas, I'd say it's 60-40 right now, in the scales, Trump is way
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.200]  better than the Santas right now, and I intend to put pressure on the Santas, you should
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.840]  too, to come out against this war as well, he's been somewhat supporting it, this could
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.920]  end our civilization in life as we know it, so I'm gonna come back with this very important
[15:50.920 --> 15:54.760]  Trump clip and more, but whether you're an AP reporter that calls out the Defense Department
[15:54.760 --> 15:58.040]  for starting the war, or whether you're Trump calling it out, everybody needs to do it right
[15:58.040 --> 16:01.760]  now.
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.720]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane

[18:00.120 --> 18:06.720]  In the year 2000 Alex Jones' film dark secrets inside bohemian grove showed the world how
[18:06.720 --> 18:14.480]  our so called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[18:14.480 --> 18:21.520]  In 2007 Alex Jones releases end game, exposing the world elites plans for covertly using
[18:21.520 --> 18:27.200]  biological weapons against all of mankind and by the time they launched their attack
[18:27.200 --> 18:34.280]  in 2020 Alex Jones' info wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly
[18:34.280 --> 18:37.160]  vaccines that we knew were coming.
[18:37.160 --> 18:43.200]  This is why they attack us, this is why we need your support because we tell the truth
[18:43.200 --> 18:45.800]  Alex Jones was right.
[18:45.800 --> 18:52.120]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the links, join us in
[18:52.120 --> 19:00.680]  the fight for freedom and help us defeat the new world order.
[19:00.680 --> 19:08.160]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist, I have come from nowhere to
[19:08.160 --> 19:12.160]  the very heights of politics not just in America but in the world.
[19:12.160 --> 19:17.680]  We are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war but I don't
[19:17.680 --> 19:18.680]  deserve the credit.
[19:18.680 --> 19:23.440]  Yes I've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars for the
[19:23.440 --> 19:29.280]  real reason you have the success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[19:29.280 --> 19:31.560]  the new world order we've ever had.
[19:31.560 --> 19:38.280]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[19:38.280 --> 19:42.240]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[19:42.240 --> 19:45.080]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[19:45.080 --> 19:50.760]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[19:50.760 --> 19:54.600]  now because we are over the target and this great is happening.
[19:54.600 --> 20:01.280]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[20:01.280 --> 20:28.120]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:28.120 --> 20:39.960]  I tried to paint your clusters of information as they move through the computer but it didn't
[20:39.960 --> 20:40.960]  look like.
[20:40.960 --> 21:08.400]  Once you get in, once you take the red dude, there's no going back, the matrix is a documentary
[21:08.400 --> 21:11.240]  as they say.
[21:11.240 --> 21:15.940]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, so let me finish the point I was making before I do this key
[21:15.940 --> 21:23.320]  trump clip from last night that is absolute truth and goodness and makes him in my mind
[21:23.320 --> 21:32.160]  pull way ahead in the fruit of the tree analogy against the sanis and we want to pit them
[21:32.160 --> 21:39.600]  against each other to make iron, sharpen iron to get them both to really be hardcore against
[21:39.600 --> 21:40.600]  the new world order.
[21:40.600 --> 21:45.000]  That's what the populace want, that's what's good, that's what's true, let's do it.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.560]  We have the initiative, the globalist agenda is horrible, nobody wants it except for a
[21:49.560 --> 21:54.360]  tiny new world order cabal of criminals, a cult.
[21:54.360 --> 21:58.080]  But I don't get up here and go well, who will give me money, will it be the sanis or trump,
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.000]  I never got money from those guys in the RNC, I don't sit up and say what will get me ahead
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.800]  with the system, I would have taken the offer to go meet Henry Kissinger when the head of
[22:05.800 --> 22:09.360]  the Kissinger group tried to get me to go to New York 15 years ago, I would have taken
[22:09.360 --> 22:13.440]  the other deals, I would have taken the Fox News deal whenever they wanted to start me
[22:13.440 --> 22:20.600]  with a Saturday show, again 15, 14 years ago when I had the offers from Roger Ailes.
[22:20.600 --> 22:25.160]  I want to be independent, that's what's really valuable to me, whether it's with a bullhorn
[22:25.160 --> 22:30.320]  beside the road or in a high tech studio talking to millions of people, that's my goal.
[22:30.320 --> 22:34.560]  And so listeners get a little confused sometimes, they say well some days you're for DeSantis
[22:34.560 --> 22:39.360]  and some days you're for Trump, are you flip-flopping, no, I'm always clear that I want them as
[22:39.360 --> 22:46.760]  major leaders that have a huge bully pulpit to promote issues of freedom and the truth.
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.720]  And so when Trump does something good, I support him, when Trump does something bad, I come
[22:50.720 --> 22:54.600]  after him, when DeSantis does something good, I support him, when DeSantis does something
[22:54.600 --> 22:57.920]  bad, I come out against it, it's real simple.
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.360]  I'm not here like I'm judging a Miss America contest of who the better candidate is, because
[23:02.360 --> 23:10.000]  how they look, or who's got a better suit, or who spoke better, I care about results.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.680]  Rand Paul certainly is, he's a good speaker but he doesn't have a lot of charisma, but
[23:16.680 --> 23:20.400]  I love him and think he would be a great president because he's smart and has really
[23:20.400 --> 23:21.400]  good policy ideas.
[23:21.400 --> 23:26.120]  So I don't care about how good a speaker you are, I care about what you stand for and
[23:26.120 --> 23:28.960]  your integrity, and that's what we should all stand for.
[23:28.960 --> 23:31.440]  What is the results of what you produce?
[23:31.440 --> 23:35.760]  My grandfather would always tell my dad, me when I was little, I don't want to hear talk,
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.160]  I want results.
[23:38.160 --> 23:41.520]  I don't want to hear about how you're going to do this, I want to see how you're going
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.160]  to do this.
[23:44.160 --> 23:47.280]  And that's what it comes down to.
[23:47.280 --> 23:51.040]  And so with what Trump has done, we've got all the big World War III news here, because
[23:51.040 --> 23:55.480]  we're in the beginning of World War III, make no mistake, questions, will it go nuclear,
[23:55.480 --> 23:59.080]  will it go chemical, will it go biological, will it go cyber attack, and they've already
[23:59.080 --> 24:02.920]  cyber attacked and took Putin's speech off TV and off the Internet two days ago, and
[24:02.920 --> 24:05.800]  a giant attack on Russia, I mean we're already there.
[24:05.800 --> 24:07.720]  The escalation is already out of control.
[24:07.720 --> 24:12.000]  The question is can it be contained, can it be wound back down?
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.320]  The way it's going to do that is if we've got, depending on the poll, there's hundreds
[24:16.320 --> 24:22.080]  of them, but they're all on the low ends, 75 to 87%, we've covered the polls, covered
[24:22.080 --> 24:28.920]  another one that was in the high 80s yesterday, that 80% on average of the American people
[24:28.920 --> 24:32.960]  do not want this damn war, plus it hasn't been declared and it's illegal.
[24:32.960 --> 24:36.440]  But we've been slept, walked into it, because we never support a war with Russia, just start
[24:36.440 --> 24:40.080]  one day like that, we'd say that's crazy, don't do it.
[24:40.080 --> 24:43.680]  But if they can slowly escalate it, they can give what they want.
[24:43.680 --> 24:51.320]  But if we see things like the AP reporter who nailed Kirby that we played yesterday saying
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.160]  the NATO started this, NATO admittedly overthrew Ukraine, George Soros brags about it, now you've
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.240]  got troops massing there, been fighting the Russians for years, what do you expect Putin
[25:00.240 --> 25:02.920]  to do?
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.320]  I think Putin made a big mistake walking into a trap, but I can see what we would do if folks
[25:07.320 --> 25:12.840]  were overthrowing countries on our doorstep and manipulating political movements inside
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.800]  our country to overthrow our government, but see that's what the globalists have done,
[25:17.800 --> 25:21.040]  it's not been the Russians overthrew the US government got control of it, it's been the
[25:21.040 --> 25:23.520]  New World Order allied with China.
[25:23.520 --> 25:28.320]  Now they've split with the Chinese, there's a rift right now, but they're still for their
[25:28.320 --> 25:35.200]  goals a worldwide corporate fascist control grid, cashless society, market to be system,
[25:35.200 --> 25:38.640]  they're simpatico, the Chai comms of the New World Order.
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.680]  But just like Hitler and Stalin splitting in the middle of World War II when they had
[25:42.680 --> 25:48.080]  a armistice and a pact, an agreement before, the same things happened with China.
[25:48.080 --> 25:51.960]  So we're entering that moment in history where more happens in a year than happened
[25:51.960 --> 25:56.600]  in the previous 50, we're entering a very fluid, dangerous point and what we need to
[25:56.600 --> 26:03.080]  see is Rand Paul, not just calling for Fauci to be arrested, that's great, but coming out
[26:03.080 --> 26:07.800]  against the war full, throatedly with press conferences and making the rounds and we need
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.800]  to see constituents of Senator Johnson, who's a great guy, call him up and say knock off
[26:11.800 --> 26:18.040]  the war mongering, we need demonstrations, we need peaceful action, we need civil disobedience,
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.400]  we need to take action like we did with the poison shots and we can back this thing down
[26:23.400 --> 26:27.600]  and put the genie back in the bottle, but there's not much time because the road we're
[26:27.600 --> 26:31.640]  going down very quickly leads to nuclear war.
[26:31.640 --> 26:34.040]  And everybody knows that's a fact.
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.160]  So I salute Trump, he said we need a clean house of all warmongers and American last
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.360]  globalist in national security national complex.
[26:42.360 --> 26:44.640]  World War III has never been closer, yeah we're in it.
[26:44.640 --> 26:51.600]  Then it is right now, Trump thrashes America's last globalist over Ukraine war and it goes
[26:51.600 --> 27:02.920]  on from there, demented war mongers and globalists, here's what Trump had to say, clip 14.
[27:02.920 --> 27:06.520]  World War III has never been closer than it is right now.
[27:06.520 --> 27:12.920]  We need to clean house of all of the war mongers and America last globalist in the deep state,
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.200]  the Pentagon, the State Department and the national security industrial complex.
[27:18.200 --> 27:19.200]  You know what?
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.200]  It's my fault, it's a three and a half minute clip, I didn't look at it, I thought it was
[27:22.200 --> 27:25.040]  a two minute clip because there's another clip here of Trump that's two minutes.
[27:25.040 --> 27:27.240]  So I went to that late, we're going to go to break it in a few minutes and come back
[27:27.240 --> 27:28.240]  with it.
[27:28.240 --> 27:30.520]  It's just too important to have it cut off by the break.
[27:30.520 --> 27:37.240]  But again, the same as was two three points ahead in my mind of judging a tree by its fruits
[27:37.240 --> 27:38.920]  a month ago.
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.760]  He was 52 to 48 against Trump, 53 to 47 in my mind how my mind counts these beans.
[27:45.760 --> 27:49.160]  You've got your own view and you're welcome to it, I'd love to take calls tomorrow and
[27:49.160 --> 27:50.160]  hear what you think about this.
[27:50.160 --> 27:53.600]  But DeSantis was ahead of Trump in action.
[27:53.600 --> 27:58.320]  Not now with this and he's given a bunch of other speeches, this is what we need to hear,
[27:58.320 --> 27:59.320]  this is what's going on.
[27:59.320 --> 28:03.560]  And look, we spent a lot of time on the train derailment, the horrible fire in the Dockson
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.320]  and it's important and it's really bad for people in the area.
[28:07.320 --> 28:12.640]  But compared to nuclear war, it doesn't even show up on the Richter scale and the same
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.480]  people ignoring what's happened in Ohio are the ones pushing us into nuclear war.
[28:17.480 --> 28:23.240]  So yeah, let's focus on Ohio and let's let's pressure, you know, the EPA that's finally
[28:23.240 --> 28:26.360]  going in there to try to clean this up.
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.280]  Let's find out who gave the orders to blow this up and burn this up when it creates this
[28:30.280 --> 28:32.680]  deadly Dockson when you add those chemicals together.
[28:32.680 --> 28:36.280]  Any chemistry first year student would know that in college.
[28:36.280 --> 28:40.880]  But can we focus a little more on World War Three and the collapse border and all of that
[28:40.880 --> 28:45.280]  because this is the nation standing nation ending events that we're witnessing.
[28:45.280 --> 28:46.760]  So we're going to go to break.
[28:46.760 --> 28:49.160]  I'm going to come back with a Trump clip and a lot more.
[28:49.160 --> 28:50.960]  This is big though.
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.840]  And yeah, no, I'm behind Trump right now for president.
[28:54.840 --> 29:02.640]  I'm supporting him for president right now.
[29:02.640 --> 29:09.120]  C is in a fight for its very life and info wars for decades has been at the very forefront
[29:09.120 --> 29:11.920]  of the fight for a pro human future.

[33:27.280 --> 33:34.640]  alex jones all right really smart and formative gas to cover the waterfront.
[33:34.640 --> 33:39.720]  Coming in studio next hour definitely don't want to miss that let me just get back to
[33:39.720 --> 33:46.160]  where I am on this Trump situation the sanis has been supporting the Ukraine war and that
[33:46.160 --> 33:51.000]  is a big black mark on him and he needs to come out against that I understand he's a
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.760]  governor of a state but he can't have his KK-82 we all know he's running for president
[33:55.760 --> 34:01.600]  so if he comes out full-throatedly against the war he will then be better than Trump
[34:01.600 --> 34:05.200]  because Trump's bad on the shot but currently world war three is the most dangerous thing
[34:05.200 --> 34:09.480]  we're facing Trump is putting his money where his mouth is and doing things that are totally
[34:09.480 --> 34:14.840]  bucking the system I have to morally than say I support Trump and it's not a lesser
[34:14.840 --> 34:22.520]  of two evils I'm not supporting Biden I'm not supporting Gavin Newsom is the word is
[34:22.520 --> 34:26.640]  Biden's probably not going to run that's coming out now obviously he can't the guy can barely
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.600]  talk if you got a choice between Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump you can't go with Gavin
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.200]  Newsom obviously but that's not the issue the issue is putting pressure on Trump and
[34:36.200 --> 34:41.320]  the sanis and the republicans to stop all the world war three and poison shot garbage
[34:41.320 --> 34:47.360]  and tomorrow I will open the phones up on the subject Trump or the sanis or maybe you
[34:47.360 --> 34:53.040]  don't want either one well then what are we going to do because believe me I am so frustrated
[34:53.040 --> 34:58.640]  by Jared Kushner and Trump giving a bunch of rhetoric against censorship but doing nothing
[34:58.640 --> 35:03.400]  then it bit him in the ass I got big problems with Trump I don't care about being patted
[35:03.400 --> 35:07.760]  on the head by Trump that Trump stopped calling me years ago because I talked I talked about
[35:07.760 --> 35:12.560]  policy and I'd say I don't want to hear how great I am I'm not one of your donors I want
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.520]  action against the deep state and Obama put almost three billion dollars in with this
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.400]  breakaway network inside the government to censor the American people with the CIA and
[35:22.400 --> 35:27.760]  the Defense Department and the Justice Department and I would tell them the legislation name
[35:27.760 --> 35:33.520]  the Defense Authorization Act 2017 signed a law before Obama left the countering foreign
[35:33.520 --> 35:39.080]  disinformation propaganda act and Trump would get frustrated I'm like dude I'm not here
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.240]  to be petted like a little kitty cat and I purr in your lap and I feel good because
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.720]  a big famous president is calling me I don't give a hell about that I don't give a damn
[35:47.720 --> 35:54.080]  about Hollywood I had Hollywood offer me the big rolls if I would just go along with them
[35:54.080 --> 35:59.360]  15 years ago that's when the big offers came from Hollywood and Henry Kissinger and all
[35:59.360 --> 36:05.160]  of them and I told him piss up a rope because who wants to be a Hollywood star when America
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.560]  collapses and you're in World War three who wants to be part of the elite that's screwing
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.240]  everybody over that's not a hard offer to turn down you could put a gun to my head and make
[36:14.240 --> 36:20.400]  me follow it now we tell you those stories folks because you understand how real this
[36:20.400 --> 36:28.880]  is almost everybody else took the money almost everybody else sold out but we the people
[36:28.880 --> 36:35.640]  didn't and so we're at this point right now where I have to say what Trump is doing against
[36:35.640 --> 36:40.480]  the war he's given a bunch of these speeches is absolutely essential the only thing he's
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.440]  wrong about is saying World War three could start any day he thinks of World War three
[36:44.440 --> 36:49.160]  is nuclear World War three is just a big conflict between major powers that starts breaking
[36:49.160 --> 36:55.160]  out around the world and Israel's bombing Iran China's making big moves in the South
[36:55.160 --> 37:02.040]  China Sea they're all talking about full war it's already here so here's what Trump had
[37:02.040 --> 37:08.320]  to say last night the full videos on him for worse.com World War three has never been closer
[37:08.320 --> 37:14.480]  than it is right now we need to clean house of all of the war mongers and America last
[37:14.480 --> 37:20.500]  globalist in the deep state the Pentagon the State Department and the national security
[37:20.500 --> 37:26.040]  industrial complex one of the reasons I was the only president in generations who didn't
[37:26.040 --> 37:32.280]  start a war is that I was the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many
[37:32.280 --> 37:38.760]  of Washington's generals bureaucrats and the so-called diplomats who only know how to get
[37:38.760 --> 37:44.160]  us into conflict but they don't know how to get us out for decades we've had the very
[37:44.160 --> 37:50.760]  same people such as Victorian Newland and many others just like are obsessed with pushing
[37:50.760 --> 37:58.240]  Ukraine toward NATO not to mention the State Department support for uprisings in Ukraine
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.640]  these people have been seeking confrontation for a long time much like the case in Iraq
[38:04.640 --> 38:10.320]  and other parts of the world and now we're teetering on the brink of World War three
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.600]  and a lot of people don't see it but I see it and I've been right about a lot of things
[38:14.600 --> 38:21.000]  they all say Trump's been right about everything none of this excuses in any way the outrageous
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.520]  and horrible invasion of Ukraine one year ago which would have never happened if I was
[38:27.520 --> 38:33.720]  your president not even a little chance but it does mean that here in America we need
[38:33.720 --> 38:40.360]  to get rid of the corrupt globalist establishment that has botched every major foreign policy
[38:40.360 --> 38:46.840]  decision for decades and that includes president Biden whose own people said he's never made
[38:46.840 --> 38:53.440]  a good decision when it comes to looking at other countries and looking at wars we have
[38:53.440 --> 38:59.520]  to replace them with people who support American interests over our four years in the White
[38:59.520 --> 39:06.080]  House we made incredible progress in putting the America last contingent aside and bringing
[39:06.080 --> 39:13.160]  the world to peace and now we're going to complete the mission the State Department Pentagon
[39:13.160 --> 39:19.280]  and national security establishment will be a very different place by the end of my administration
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.000]  in fact just into my administration it'll be a very different place and it'll get things
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.160]  done just like I did four years ago we never had it so good we'll also stop the lobbyists
[39:32.160 --> 39:37.640]  and the big defense contractors from going in and pushing our senior military and national
[39:37.640 --> 39:45.480]  security officials toward conflict only to reward them when they retire with lucrative
[39:45.480 --> 39:50.920]  jobs getting paid millions and millions of dollars take a look at the globalist war
[39:50.920 --> 39:57.600]  monger and donors backing our opponents that's because they're candidates of war I am the
[39:57.600 --> 40:03.600]  president who delivers peace and its peace through strength there was a reason we had
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.760]  no conflict there was a reason we didn't get into wars because other countries respected
[40:08.760 --> 40:15.360]  us I entirely built all right from the beginning rebuilt our military it's a big reason for
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.560]  that they didn't want to mess around with the United States and now they're laughing
[40:19.560 --> 40:25.520]  at us we could end the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours with the right leadership at the end
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.600]  of my next four years the war mongers and frauds and failures of the senior ranks of
[40:30.600 --> 40:36.400]  our government will all be gone and we will have a new group of competent national security
[40:36.400 --> 40:42.560]  officials who believe in defending America's vital interests above all else thank you very
[40:42.560 --> 40:49.800]  much all right that's a three and a half minute clip I could spend months deciphering it everything
[40:49.800 --> 40:58.800]  you said is true about the deep state the revolving doors the system designing failure
[40:58.800 --> 41:04.680]  the danger of accelerated war beyond world war three nuclear war that was an important
[41:04.680 --> 41:11.320]  speech and you've got to support Trump doing that courage and truth is contagious we need

[50:21.760 --> 50:28.000]  within the year that's up on info wars dot com we mentioned this yesterday but here are
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.360]  the articles physical attacks on power grid surged a new peak politico wall street journal
[50:34.360 --> 50:40.680]  all reporting what we told you we were tracking power grid attack surge are likely to continue
[50:40.680 --> 50:51.120]  study fines attacks on the u.s. power grid are surging the civilization is being purposely
[50:51.120 --> 50:58.440]  collapsed right now and the question is why are we putting up with it so by the year and
[50:58.440 --> 51:04.120]  a half ago we all saw biden fall down repeatedly going up the stairs to puppet one or air
[51:04.120 --> 51:15.600]  force one well leaving poland he fell down again while scrambling up the stairs and again
[51:15.600 --> 51:21.180]  this is so emblematic of somebody with dementia with serious cognitive problems who's a puppet
[51:21.180 --> 51:27.240]  of the globalist and of course for a cobalt is third unelected administration but he really
[51:27.240 --> 51:32.280]  thinks he's president he really thinks he's dynamic and he really thinks he can scrabble
[51:32.280 --> 51:37.680]  up the stairs he's like an old dog that can't hunt anymore but he thinks he can and that's
[51:37.680 --> 51:42.880]  emblematic of where our republic is led by these skeletons i'm i played the clip yesterday
[51:42.880 --> 51:47.440]  that cue that up if you can find it and then the whole two hour speech is insane george
[51:47.440 --> 51:53.880]  soros in germany last week in a speech where you couldn't understand half of it and again
[51:53.880 --> 52:01.760]  this is a guy to a great extent calling the shots more than even oh biden go ahead and
[52:01.760 --> 52:14.560]  buy the club
[52:14.560 --> 52:38.400]  acid would increase the level of the oceans by seven meters.
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.560]  That's who's running our country and starting wars with Russia.
[52:42.560 --> 52:45.080]  That's who thinks they're in complete control of society.
[52:45.080 --> 52:49.560]  Now, let me get to the poison shot stack before our guest comes in.
[52:49.560 --> 52:53.840]  This is a small smattering of today's news.
[52:53.840 --> 53:00.760]  Vaccinated, overrepresented in all cases, deaths, ONS data shows.
[53:00.760 --> 53:04.600]  That's just out of England, the only country putting out some data.
[53:04.600 --> 53:08.440]  But the insurance companies, they have the data around the world,
[53:08.440 --> 53:12.800]  and I'll show you a map just in Europe of where all the excess
[53:12.800 --> 53:16.520]  deaths are, highest rate ever recorded.
[53:16.520 --> 53:22.880]  And it is completely corresponding to the level of the amount of shots
[53:22.880 --> 53:25.400]  of the so-called vaccine we're taking.
[53:25.400 --> 53:28.800]  Dr. Fauci comes clean on vaccines or upstory viruses.
[53:28.800 --> 53:33.240]  Suddenly comes out and says they don't work.
[53:33.240 --> 53:36.280]  Israel court offered Ministry of Health.
[53:36.280 --> 53:42.280]  Israeli court ordered Ministry of Health to release the agreement with Pfizer.
[53:42.280 --> 53:46.800]  These two pages contain the section titled liability and indemnity provision.
[53:46.800 --> 53:50.600]  99% of it is blacked out.
[53:50.600 --> 53:52.760]  I wish this was a joke, but it's not.
[53:52.760 --> 53:54.720]  And look at what they released.
[53:54.720 --> 53:59.320]  The fact that it gives them indemnity and freedom from any liability,
[53:59.320 --> 54:05.840]  give experimental shots to us, and 99% of it is blacked out.
[54:05.840 --> 54:08.040]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[54:08.040 --> 54:10.560]  And I have this clip out of Canada.
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.040]  I'm kind of springing this on you guys to see if you can find it in the Airstreams list.
[54:14.040 --> 54:18.560]  Liberal explains, this is the lawyer for the government, vaccine contracts
[54:18.560 --> 54:20.200]  with no liability clause.
[54:20.200 --> 54:22.840]  And he goes on to say, well, we didn't know what it would do,
[54:22.840 --> 54:27.440]  and it might really hurt people, so we gave them full liability protection.
[54:27.440 --> 54:28.600]  I thought it was all tested.
[54:28.600 --> 54:31.240]  I thought it was all great.
[54:31.240 --> 54:34.360]  We'll get to that in a moment, but first, this is so bad.
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.000]  Massive amounts of excess deaths, and nobody seems to know why.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.080]  What do you think is causing this?
[54:41.080 --> 54:42.800]  Ask Peter Sweden.
[54:42.800 --> 54:45.440]  And it shows the death numbers.
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.680]  And as you go up, in the higher vaccinated areas,
[54:50.680 --> 54:51.840]  you get the higher death rates.
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.080]  Notice, in Russia, and Eastern Europe, and Turkey, and everywhere else,
[54:57.080 --> 54:59.960]  there's no excess deaths.
[54:59.960 --> 55:04.440]  But the more a country submits and forces its population to take it,
[55:04.440 --> 55:07.200]  the higher the death rate.
[55:07.200 --> 55:12.040]  Here are those numbers, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:12.040 --> 55:15.960]  But on average, it's a 56% increase in death
[55:15.960 --> 55:20.160]  when you average all age groups together from the shots.
[55:20.160 --> 55:21.840]  Here's a lawyer breaking it down.
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.320]  Criminal indictments, the US Department of Defense, along with Fauci Gates,
[55:26.320 --> 55:32.640]  Tedros, Moderna, Pfizer, FDA, CDC, WEF, CA, and others willfully
[55:32.640 --> 55:36.320]  and criminally engaged in racketeering illegal advertising fraud
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.680]  and mass premeditated murder of millions of innocent people worldwide.
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.960]  It's being testified to international organizations.
[55:44.960 --> 55:49.360]  But don't worry, they think you'll forget the last virus with the new virus.
[55:49.360 --> 55:52.480]  Who convenes urgent meeting over outbreak of deadly Marburg virus
[55:52.480 --> 55:55.440]  that kills 90% of those infected?
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.040]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of the government lawyer
[55:59.040 --> 56:05.560]  explains vaccine contracts with no liability clause in Canada.
[56:05.560 --> 56:08.920]  These agreements require employees of the government of candidates
[56:08.920 --> 56:13.600]  that access these documents to sign confidentiality agreements.
[56:13.600 --> 56:14.680]  And why is that?
[56:14.680 --> 56:17.960]  Why is there much more redactions, as my colleague said,
[56:17.960 --> 56:20.360]  in these documents than in other documents?
[56:20.360 --> 56:25.080]  It's because these documents were signed at the beginning of a pandemic
[56:25.080 --> 56:27.760]  when everybody was desperate for vaccines,
[56:27.760 --> 56:31.720]  when companies were being told to rush vaccine production,
[56:31.720 --> 56:36.040]  due testing in an unprecedented way, in a way they normally don't do it.
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.160]  So these companies were exposed to way higher liability,
[56:39.160 --> 56:42.560]  putting their products on the market than they normally would,
[56:42.560 --> 56:45.360]  because they didn't do the type of testing
[56:45.360 --> 56:48.080]  that normally takes these drugs years to come to market.
[56:48.080 --> 56:51.080]  They did it all in less than a year.
[56:51.080 --> 56:53.440]  So that's why these companies said,
[56:53.440 --> 56:58.000]  if I'm going to deliver you this product that I haven't tested in my normal way,
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.440]  I want to have different conditions.
[57:00.440 --> 57:03.760]  And with companies, all countries around the world competing with each other
[57:03.760 --> 57:07.120]  to get these, the countries had less leverage than they normally do.
[57:07.120 --> 57:11.040]  For example, if we were entering into flu vaccine contracts
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.520]  or monkeypox contracts or other things that were normally available,
[57:16.520 --> 57:19.000]  this would be a different issue.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.360]  But these are already signed.
[57:20.360 --> 57:22.720]  They were signed at a time the government didn't have that leverage
[57:22.720 --> 57:23.520]  in negotiations.
[57:23.520 --> 57:27.280]  We just wanted to sign as many vaccine contracts with as many producers as possible,
[57:27.280 --> 57:29.040]  because Canadians were desperate for vaccines.
[57:29.040 --> 57:31.600]  And in the end, it worked out we got vaccines
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.080]  and we were one of the countries that got to vaccinate everybody the fastest.
[57:36.080 --> 57:39.280]  But it didn't work out unless you learned to kill a bunch of people.
[57:39.280 --> 57:43.040]  It was the same program of stampeding people into submission all over the world.
[57:43.040 --> 57:45.280]  And now there's a UN treaty to take control of our bodies.
[57:45.280 --> 57:48.440]  Hour number two straight ahead, you don't want to miss this.
[57:48.440 --> 57:51.840]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[57:51.840 --> 57:58.640]  And Info Wars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[57:58.640 --> 58:00.400]  We can't stay on air without your help.
[58:00.400 --> 58:02.280]  And I want to thank you all for your past support.
[58:02.280 --> 58:05.000]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.760]  at infowarstore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[58:09.760 --> 58:14.280]  Ultimate Bone Broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock.
[58:14.280 --> 58:19.000]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing. Nitric boosts what it does for your heart.
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.880]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[58:20.880 --> 58:24.880]  All these products like Ultimate Crill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality,
[58:24.880 --> 58:29.080]  they're all available at in stock, ready to ship to you right down infowarstore.com.
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.480]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset in the World for the World,
[58:33.480 --> 58:38.080]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[58:38.080 --> 58:40.480]  And the last month, I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books,
[58:40.480 --> 58:44.480]  we didn't have them for sale. But now, I sign the last books and get them right now.
[58:44.480 --> 58:49.480]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[58:49.480 --> 58:53.480]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[58:53.480 --> 58:58.080]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[58:58.080 --> 59:04.480]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vanda Waters Detoxification Supplement.
[59:04.480 --> 59:11.480]  That features Natokinase. It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[59:11.480 --> 59:17.480]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[59:17.480 --> 59:21.480]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection,
[59:21.480 --> 59:25.480]  and definitely with the vaccines. People are lower with the spike protein, they don't feel well.
[59:25.480 --> 59:30.480]  This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[59:30.480 --> 59:34.480]  So does Ivermectin, and now Natokinase. Isn't it interesting?
[59:34.480 --> 59:40.480]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[59:40.480 --> 59:44.480]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that,
[59:44.480 --> 01:00:00.480]  because it's important, you didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.480]  When you have US senators in both parties saying,
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.480]  we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before,
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:16.480]  but what do you think that makes the Russians do? Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.480]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine, I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.480]  Only one level above that on their death con, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:33.480]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:40.480]  Think of their ignorance. Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.480]  that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:52.480]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5, land-launched systems that can also launch from ships
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:58.480]  that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down, and yes, the United States has those too.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.480]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed system that we don't have. It's on record the U.S. has those systems.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.480]  The point is, it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason,
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.480]  because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.480]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war, especially when Russia's not starting to fight with us,
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.480]  and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country's run by Russia
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.480]  when that was all a giant lie, the globalists of the outside evil force.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:01.480]  I'm as mad as hell. I'm not going to take this anymore. Just get up from your chairs right now.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.480]  What are you doing? Who in this universe is yelling?
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.480]  Open it and stick your head out and yell and keep yelling.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.480]  I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.480]  I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.480]  I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.480]  I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.480]  I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.480]  I'm mad as hell. I'm mad as hell.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:54.480]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:00.480]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he let out. He didn't know where he was going,
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.480]  but he knew he had to go somewhere. Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.480]  That old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide,
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.480]  open a sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.480]  Paul are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:21.480]  He says, the British is coming. The British is coming. Get you a gun. We're going to have us a revolution.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.480]  And them farmers come up piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.480]  Minute men, there's called. What's minute men? Minute men?
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.480]  There's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice, and when Paul comes screeching down the road that way,
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.480]  they grab their guns and hid out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.480]  And when the British come pranks and long haul dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:54.480]  It was a sight to see. And then it happened. They fired the gun.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:01.480]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.480]  Oh, get out.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:28.480]  That's a fact. That's the way this country started.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:34.480]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.480]  but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:59.480]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:05.480]  There is a war for the future happening right now. There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny,
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.480]  our children's destiny. And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.480]  It takes commitment. That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to infowarstore.com
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:22.480]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:27.480]  Well, I've been following this guy for more than a decade, such prolific work,
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.480]  and then I've tried to get the producers a few times to get him on, but it never happened.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.480]  Turns out he lives in Drip Exprings. He was on with Mike Adams there staying in the 4th hour.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:41.480]  Michael Yon is here, and wow, did try to describe your whole background, the thousands of stories you broke,
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:47.480]  all over the world what you've done, from the war zones to the border to hunting cannibals,
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:56.480]  just all of it is wild. Absolutely wild. You're on Twitter at Michael, underscore Yon, Y-O-N,
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.480]  and of course, MichaelYon.locals.com. Great to have you here with us in the next two hours.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.480]  I kind of want to just let you take it away, because you know so much.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.480]  It's really an honor to come on your show. It's amazing actually.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:18.480]  Well, yeah, I've come to Texas because this is an epicenter of the action, not because people that know me
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:24.480]  know that wherever I go, you should probably go away from. I actually have an office in Thailand.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:32.480]  When it comes to information war, by the way, info wars, I've actually written three books on information war,
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.480]  but they're all in Japanese, unfortunately, they're not in English, because I've been trying to wake up
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.480]  the Japanese to the incredible information war that they are undergoing.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:50.480]  It's an information war designed to split Korea and Japan and the United States, that defense triangle,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:57.480]  and it's been pretty effective against Korea and Japan. But in any case, right, I've been a war correspondent for years
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.480]  and mostly Iraq for a couple years, Afghanistan for a couple of years, off to Philippines.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.480]  I was out with Maoist in Nepal and a lot of the fighting.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]  Before that, you were in the military?
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:14.480]  I was in special forces in the military, right, and so that gave me a good background for understanding
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.480]  a lot of the unconventional warfare that we see today.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.480]  And for instance, I lived in Poland for a couple of years, lived in Germany for four years,
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:32.480]  and so I spent six years, and I spent most of my time overseas, most of my life has been overseas in about 90 countries.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.480]  So although I'm American, I've lived all over the United States, I went to school in California,
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.480]  I grew up in Florida, you know, stationed at Fort Bragg, of course, in special forces,
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.480]  in bad tolls, Germany, and that sort of thing.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.480]  So I've been around, I've seen a few things, I've learned a few things, and now we see that we are in big trouble.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.480]  And the highest level of warfare, of course, is information war, info wars.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.480]  That was my first question before we hit all your great knowledge is,
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.480]  how would you describe the state of the world in America right now?
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.480]  Problematic, to put it lightly.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.480]  This morning when I woke up, I called Mike Flynn, who's a big fan of your show, by the way,
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:13.480]  and I told him I'm coming on with Alex today, and we talked about this.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.480]  I mean, we are that close to a thermonuclear war.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.480]  I mean, it's obviously, you get it, I watch you, Alex, you're talking about it all the time.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.480]  We are amazingly close to a very serious, we're in a serious war right now.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:32.480]  For instance, with CCP, the Chinese Communist Party has been at war with us for years.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:40.480]  One only needs to read to unrestricted warfare to watch what China does.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:48.480]  Of course, I got kicked out of Hong Kong in 2020, I was covering the resistance in Hong Kong
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.480]  for about seven months, and they finally kicked me out.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.480]  They should have kicked me out after about seven minutes, but you might have seen it in the news.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.480]  But that was a huge information operation as well.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:05.480]  In Hong Kong, one of the things that the Chinese Communist Party has done to destroy Hong Kong
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.480]  is weaponized immigration.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.480]  So they've been bringing in mainlanders into Hong Kong for years,
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.480]  and they've been bringing in, on average, 100 to 150 a day for many years.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.480]  Now it's a larger number, and they're trying to force the Cantonese speakers there to speak Mandarin,
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]  not to speak Cantonese.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.480]  They're trying to rewriting the history lessons in the Hong Kongers' school books and that sort of thing.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.480]  So it's that information war to rewrite the history and persuade the Hong Kongers.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:39.480]  And also they're doing the same thing, by the way, in Okinawa, Japan, trying to get the Japanese who live on Okinawa
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.480]  to think that they're actually historically Chinese.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:49.480]  They're trying to get the Okinawans there to speak old dialects that aren't really spoken much anymore,
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:56.480]  putting old dialects of Japanese Okinawan dialect onto the elevator buttons on the ATM machines.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.480]  Same thing's done here with all the transgenderism. It's all a war on language.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.480]  Language. Language is the high ground. As you know, you talk about it all the time.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.480]  You can't seed the language. The little words like vaccine, it's not a vaccine.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:15.480]  You can't, or migration, we're being invaded, right? Europe is being invaded.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.480]  These aren't migrants, this is an invasion.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.480]  This is a straight-up invasion. You know, this is weaponized migration.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.480]  I was over in Morocco, what, about a year or so ago, a year and a half,
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.480]  and I was there with Chuck Holton, a good friend of mine, war correspondent, former Army Ranger, actually,
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:37.480]  and we saw that Belarus was starting to try to push migrants, quote-unquote, into Belarus and into Poland.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.480]  I knew that Poland wouldn't let them. I lived in Poland for two years.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.480]  There was a reason for that, that I lived in Poland for two years, but it was quite interesting.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.480]  And I knew that Poland, as a country, has what I call a non-Newtonian personality.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.480]  In other words, the harder you push them, the stronger they get, like you.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.480]  The harder you push, as Jones, the stronger you get.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.480]  I mean, you get punched and you get knocked down and you get back up.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.480]  Poland's like that. Poland, like the Germans, constantly push Poland.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.480]  You have to take your fair share. Poland's not going to sit like that.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:14.480]  So I flew up to the Lithuanians. I had been to the Lithuanian Army in Afghanistan, actually.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.480]  So I kept my contacts there, and from Morocco, I called up some Lithuanians.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.480]  I called up an army officer, actually.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.480]  I said, hey, what's up with Belarus pushing migrants into Lithuania?
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.480]  And he said, well, come on up. We just noticed you were in Morocco.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.480]  So I flew to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, got off the airplane, met with some top government officials.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:39.480]  I got full access to the camps, including their intelligence people, their army, police, elected officials,
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:45.480]  and saw what's happening. And basically Belarus, with Russia behind it, is pushing the migrants, invaders.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.480]  And they're from all over the world, all over Africa. Many of them are actually Syrians and Iraqis, as well, from the Middle East.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.480]  Chetians, many Chetians. I asked them about Chetians. I said, do you have any Chetians?
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.480]  So it's not just the U.N. using migrants as a weapon?
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:03.480]  Oh, no. But, however, and I told the Lithuanians, we had a little private conference there,
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.480]  and I said, you know, you're going to get an ecosystem of people here.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:14.480]  You're going to get the OIM, the ILM, depending on which language, the immigration pump you might call it.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.480]  It's also working in Darien Gap. You're going to get a Norwegian refugee council.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:29.480]  You're going to get Catholic charities. There's a little ecosystem of pumping stations that pumps these migrants from all over the world.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:37.480]  For instance, through Darien Gap, where I just came in from Darien Gap, which is a huge jungle area between Columbia and Panama.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:47.480]  I've been going to Darien Gap ever since Biden seized or whoever put the meat puppet Biden into office.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.480]  He's a dog king for those who know what dog kings are.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:14:02.480]  I knew that Darien Gap was going to be a funnel or an hourglass from Asia and from Africa and from South America into Panama and up to the United States.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:09.480]  Let me explain what the Darien Gap is. Highway 1 goes all the way from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:16.480]  You can ride on a motorcycle or a car and go all the way to Yavica, Panama, and then there's about 63 miles with no roads.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.480]  That's called the Gap, the Darien Gap. It's some pretty epic jungle.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:28.480]  The migrants will come up or the invaders will come up from about 140 different countries and they go to Columbia.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.480]  I've gone down there to Columbia and I've started the Darien Gap on that side. I didn't walk all the way through.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.480]  They will start in Columbia, go through the Darien Gap, a huge number of them die.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.480]  They walk over the Montaña de la Muerta, the mountain of death, and the three crossings were so many drowned.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:50.480]  Then the Indians start killing them, the Kuna and the Embraer Indians, who I'll go out with all the time.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.480]  That's who I go with, is with the Indians.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:58.480]  Finally, they come out through the other side of the Gap and they're put on buses and actually 39 died about a week ago
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:05.480]  in a bus accident with one of these buses that's coming up from the Darien Gap to Costa Rica border.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:13.480]  These are funded largely by the United States. For instance, Secretary Mayorkas was heading down.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.480]  That was my next point. We've got to go break. Guys, you get the clip as a bunch of them.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:24.480]  But Biden's saying, if I get elected, immediately surge the border. There's no doubt that that call and then State Department funding is causing this.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480]  That's what you're saying.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:32.480]  100%. In fact, I've stayed down on Darien Gap for months developing human sources and that sort of thing.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:40.480]  Getting to know the Indians and the Embraer Indians and the Kuna Indians and many of the workers like Red Cross.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:47.480]  And so there's actually a hotel right beside one of the camps in Darien Gap called San Vicente Camp.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:56.480]  Hold on. Stay there. This is riveting stuff. This is inside the globalist invasion of America, World War III and more of our special guest stay with us.

[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:16.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:32.480]  Well, Michael Beyonce, famous wartime correspondent, loved by the U.S. military, former Special Forces himself, and he's drilling into the 10-foot view or 5-foot view or 1-inch view about the Darien Gap and the rest of it.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:39.480]  I was asking him, give us the 35,000-foot view of the UN, the NGOs, the State Department, the larger operation.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:45.480]  I mean, inside where these people are coming from, you're seeing Chinese Russians reporting across as well.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:52.480]  Right, Chinese. In fact, a couple of weeks ago, or three weeks ago now, I was in the Darien Gap two weeks ago, and I took two Chinese with me.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:59.480]  I took a Cantonese speaker and I took a Mandarin speaker because there's so many mainland Chinese coming through the Darien Gap.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:05.480]  The mainland Chinese will fly to Ecuador first, and then they go through Columbia and they come through the Gap.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.480]  And so I took those two speakers.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.480]  That's where the Panama.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:17.480]  They start on the Colombian side, they'll start at a place called Nicocaly, and they get on boats, which I've done, and then they'll go on the boats to a place called Coppergana.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:23.480]  And from there, they'll either boat or there's two different main journeys to get into the Darien Gap at that point.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:30.480]  The Chinese have more money, so they take a more luxurious route. You might say it's still quite difficult and dangerous.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:37.480]  And the mainland Chinese will pay about $20,000 to get from mainland China into Panama itself.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:42.480]  And so they've got money, and again, I took two Chinese down there with me recently.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.480]  One spoke Cantonese, the other Mandarin.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.480]  I took them down there because I wanted to see if any actually spoke Cantonese.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.480]  None of the about 50 that we spoke with that were coming through, none spoke Cantonese.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.480]  Everybody spoke Mandarin. Nobody was from like Malaysia or Indonesia or Taiwan.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.480]  They were all from mainland China, and they're from many parts of mainland China.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.480]  They were educated people. They were not people running from the gulag or that sort of thing.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.480]  They were clearly educated people, and some spoke English, actually none spoke German.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:20.480]  I tried German on most of them, but they all said that they were coming up for jobs and that sort of thing.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.480]  There were some family units, but mostly they were military-aged males.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.480]  And some of them looked very military to me.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.480]  They were very switched on. They were alert. They were fit.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.480]  They weren't shuffling and looking at their feet, walking through.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:40.480]  They were really looking around, checking everything out, and Larry of the cameras and that sort of thing.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.480]  But I still got a lot of video of these.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.480]  Most of the people coming across our border are military-aged males from whatever country,
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.480]  whether that's Haitians or whatever.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.480]  That's the same thing in Europe.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.480]  Oh, absolutely. All over Europe, for instance.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.480]  I was just down in Dominican Republic as well.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.480]  Dominican Republic is building a border with Haiti.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.480]  And should I look at you or the camera, by the way?
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.480]  This way.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:10.480]  All right, so the Dominican Republic shares the island with Haiti, of course.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.480]  About one-third of the island is Haiti, and the other two-thirds are Dominican Republic.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.480]  And they are building a wall there, which they call their Trump wall.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:21.480]  I was just down on that wall between Haiti and Dominican Republic.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:28.480]  And the Dominican Republic has kicked out about 162,000 Haitians in the last year or so.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.480]  Now, many of the Haitians, they'll go down to Suriname in South America,
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.480]  and then they'll eventually make it through Colombia and come through the Darien Gap.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.480]  Huge amounts of Haitians are coming through.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.480]  So Haitians are one of the larger groups.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.480]  They do a huge amount of criminality, actually.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:49.480]  Whether it's Colombia or Panama or Mexico, everybody's wary of the Haitians.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.480]  Not Africans, but Haitians specifically.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.480]  And why does Colombia let them land there?
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.480]  Like, why don't they just go directly to Mexico?
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.480]  Interestingly, when I was in Colombia about two years ago,
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.480]  and there was actually a CNN on the big screen at the hotel in the restaurant in Spanish,
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.480]  showing people how to get through the Darien Gap.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.480]  It was showing migrants, if you want to call them that,
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.480]  how to get to various countries through Colombia and to the Darien Gap.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.480]  Colombia is just making money off of them.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.480]  For instance, they make a lot of money.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.480]  I mean, right now about 1,000 per day are coming through, right?
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:32.480]  And so all of these people pay a lot of money to, whether it's the boatmen or the taxi drivers or whatever.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.480]  And so there's a lot of money flows into the country that way.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.480]  And you said the State Department's helping us happen.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]  Absolutely.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.480]  Well, Secretary Mayorkas flew down there about last April.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.480]  I got word from a congressman, actually, that I was about to fly to Arizona
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.480]  and go with some congressmen on the border.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.480]  And one told me that Mayorkas was about to fly to Panama.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.480]  I said, well, if he's coming to Panama, I bet he'll go to Darien Gap.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.480]  So I went down there, and I stationed myself, and I waited for about three to four days
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.480]  in a place where I thought he might land in helicopters, which he did.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.480]  He landed in three black hawks.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.480]  I launched my drone, and the drone is Mayorkas landed.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.480]  And he went right by me, as close as we are now.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.480]  And he went into a place called San Vicente Camp.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.480]  And since that time, the camp has doubled in size.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.480]  So they've more than doubled in size.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.480]  I just droned it again two or three weeks ago.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.480]  And you can see the difference between how it was then and how it is now.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.480]  Las Blancas is another camp, which is more than—
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.480]  So they're expanding these camps all over the place?
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.480]  They're expanding the camps in size.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.480]  And also, the operation is much smoother now.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.480]  In other words, before the migrants—
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.480]  again, if you want to call them that, euphemistically called migrants—
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.480]  would come, and they might spend days or even weeks in the camps.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.480]  Now they can spend hours.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:56.480]  So once you come through the Darien Gap now, you're immediately getting put into a bus.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.480]  And again, just about a week ago, a bus had an accident, killed 39 of them.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.480]  So they'll go to two different camps.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.480]  So they go—as you come through Darien Gap, you'll feed into two different villages.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.480]  One is called Kanan-Mimbrio, right?
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.480]  It's on the Mimbrio River.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.480]  And that's about three hours up by Dugout Canoe.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.480]  It's like Apocalypse Now stuff up into the jungle.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.480]  And then there's another Emborah Indian village, also about three hours up into the jungle.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.480]  So I've been to both of these more than a dozen times.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.480]  And this is where they will feed out into is these two villages, right?
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.480]  And once you get to one of these villages, then you'll stay overnight or so.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.480]  And then you'll get put on a Dugout Canoe.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.480]  That's the only canoes out in these rivers.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:43.480]  There's crocodiles and all that. You're way out there, right?
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.480]  And so then you come down about three hours on the river.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.480]  You get put on doos and a halfs that are operated by Cinefront,
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.480]  which is like the Panamanian Border Patrol police.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.480]  They're highly professional, by the way.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.480]  And actually, a Cinefront Special Forces team just helped me get through two journalists.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.480]  And about just a few—it was a month ago or so.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.480]  Two journalists came through and went on Bannon Show, actually, when they made it.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.480]  And so I helped them get through and Cinefront actually helped us.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:17.480]  So Cinefront will then shuttle the migrants into the two camps, Laus Blancas or San Vicente.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.480]  At Laus Blancas and San Vicente, for instance, I was in Laus Blancas a few weeks ago,
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:25.480]  as soon as you get off the Dugout Canoe, there's somebody standing there with a map,
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.480]  which he's got folded out, and it's showing you where to go.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.480]  And you can take the QR code and make a QR code that will show you the map, where to go,
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:39.480]  all the migrants, where all the stops are up in Panama.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.480]  So Western governments, Europe and the U.S. are creating pipelines with third-world populations.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.480]  It's a complete pipeline with pumping stations.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.480]  You should see this. I'll give it to you when I leave.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.480]  And so you can have the QR—you can see the map yourself.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.480]  And so we have pipelines.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.480]  And at this Laus Blancas camp, there's actually a nursery tent there.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:59.480]  There's a legal tent there, giving you legal advice.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.480]  How to talk when you get to the U.S. border, you know, the things that you have to say.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.480]  And the same thing was done 10 years ago, starting in Europe, creating those pipelines.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.480]  Absolutely. And, you know, the Europeans have been a naive population of this,
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.480]  especially, for instance, the Swedes.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.480]  I was in Luxembourg last year. I spent about a week there in Luxembourg.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.480]  The last time I was in Luxembourg was when I was in the Army, right?
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.480]  And it was the jewel of Europe. It was a beautiful place.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.480]  Now, it's about literally about 50% migrants.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.480]  And you can see that on their official website.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.480]  Just sleeping on the street everywhere.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.480]  Yeah. That's not a number that came out of my head.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.480]  You can see that on their official website. I think it was 48%.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.480]  All right. Stay there. I want to talk about big picture with us.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.480]  Some of the shift gears to Ukraine war, to information warfare,
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.480]  to the New World Order, to Biden.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.480]  Just big picture. You're a smart guy.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.480]  How you would describe the world today and where you think we're going
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.480]  and what you think we can do to avert this engineered U.N. world crisis.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.480]  We'll be right back with our special guest in studio.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.480]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.480]  And the world is an insane place.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.480]  World War III has already started.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.480]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:12.480]  There's mass censorship.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.480]  James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:17.480]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.480]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.480]  It's away. But those of us on the forefront are under more attack
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480]  by the establishment than ever.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:28.480]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast,

[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.480]  So again, please take action and go to infowarstore.com today.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.480]  And I thank you.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:03.480]  I talk a lot about the great successes infowarstore has had.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.480]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.480]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.480]  When we talk about the crew at infowarstore,
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.480]  the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:18.480]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.480]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.480]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.480]  five, six, seven days a week.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.480]  It's really just incredible.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.480]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew,
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.480]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.480]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.480]  InfoWars can not stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.480]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.480]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.480]  Most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.480]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.480]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.480]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.480]  actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.480]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com,
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.480]  our fighting problems will be over.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:14.480]  Please take action now.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:56.480]  Please take action now.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:03.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:09.480]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:15.480]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:20.480]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:28.480]  Michael Yon is our guest famous investigative journalist
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.480]  for war zones around the world.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.480]  He's focusing on the collapsed border by design.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:35.480]  It's the real war zone in Europe and the United States,
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.480]  the replacement migration, the UN plan.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.480]  So give us the high-level overview of what you think's happening here.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.480]  And since I mentioned it, here's that club of Biden
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.480]  when he was a candidate saying,
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.480]  if I win, immediately surge the border.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.480]  That's because things have changed.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.480]  I would in fact make sure that there is,
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.480]  we immediately surge to the border.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.480]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.480]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.480]  That's who we are.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.480]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.480]  and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480]  Sorry, I asked you a question and played a clip.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.480]  That's my fault.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.480]  Michael, start over.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.480]  Well, there's a demographic destruction ongoing here.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.480]  It's a replacement strategy.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.480]  Of course, when you say that,
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.480]  people say that's conspiratorial, but they say that.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.480]  That's clearly what they're doing.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.480]  That's what Stalin did in 32 and 33 with the Holodomor, right?
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.480]  With the Kulaks, Kulakization, right?
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.480]  It's the same old strategy that Mao used as well.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.480]  Of course, Mao looked up to Stalin for his,
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.480]  for a lot of his hints on how to do.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:35.480]  And so now the big corporations are using Maoist technology.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.480]  Maoist control.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.480]  This is a clear, we are already in World War III.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.480]  It's just not kinetic insofar as nuclear weapons go at this time.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.480]  Give us the big picture,
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.480]  because I saw it on my account a few months ago,
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.480]  the food, the infrastructure, all of this.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480]  Right.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.480]  Now, as a war correspondent, I've done the kinetics.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.480]  I've done all the firefights for many years
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.480]  and that sort of thing and the bombs and the ambushes
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:34:59.480]  and that sort of thing.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.480]  That's kind of a lower level of warfare.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.480]  The highest level of warfare is,
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:07.480]  the PhD level is information warfare, right?
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.480]  But underneath this are so many other things.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:12.480]  For instance, food supply, energy, of course.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.480]  And the food supply is obviously crucial.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.480]  Whoever controls the food and the energy and the money.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.480]  So I've been studying the food issues for quite a while.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.480]  And in January of 2020,
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.480]  I started warning about potential famine.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.480]  And you've never heard me warn about that
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]  before as a war correspondent.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:32.480]  I would always just say be prepared, that sort of thing.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:35.480]  But I didn't say now become a prepper, right?
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.480]  And now at this point, if you're not prepping,
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.480]  you're somewhat foolish actually.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:43.480]  I hate to use that term, but let's just be realistic.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.480]  You know, and it's all about conditions, by the way.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.480]  When I talk about famine, when I say what I'm going to say next,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.480]  oftentimes people will say,
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.480]  what will be the spark?
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.480]  What will be the spark of a war?
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.480]  What will be this?
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.480]  It's not about sparks.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.480]  Sparks is kind of an amateur level of looking at things.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.480]  It's all about conditions.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.480]  Like a forest fire.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.480]  Like when I'm down in the Darien Gap in the jungle,
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.480]  it's a rainforest.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.480]  You could have a firework factory blow up in the Darien Gap.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.480]  It will leave a smoking crater
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.480]  and it might burn for a few hours and it's going to go out.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:14.480]  Conditions are not ripe for a jungle fire in the Darien Gap.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.480]  But if you have, you know, California,
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.480]  where they leave the fuel load under the dry trees
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.480]  and that sort of thing, anything will do.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.480]  A little spark, a cigarette, whatever,
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.480]  and the whole town's burn up.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.480]  It's the same way with famine.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.480]  Famines can happen suddenly or they can happen slowly.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.480]  They can happen suddenly with, for instance, a volcanic eruption.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.480]  Japan has probably had maybe more than 500 famines
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.480]  in the last 1500 years and three of the biggest ones
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.480]  started with volcanoes, right?
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:44.480]  But there's also the slow moving of famines,
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.480]  which are often intentional.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:49.480]  Often times, like, for instance, the Irish famine,
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.480]  1845 to arguably 52, depending on who you want to argue with.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:59.480]  But the potato famine, once the blight began,
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.480]  then the English took advantage of it.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.480]  Not just the English, but some others did as well.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.480]  So your enemies can take advantage of it.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.480]  Likewise, in the 1944, 45 famine,
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.480]  and what they called the Hungarventer in Netherlands,
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.480]  the Nazis actually instigated that famine.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.480]  And it was kind of a sudden famine, like a light switch.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.480]  It came on and it went off when we broke,
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.480]  after the Allies invaded and we liberated the Dutch,
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.480]  so it only lasted roughly six months.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:28.480]  So food is a weapon and the system, the bureaucrats,
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.480]  the corporations are setting up an atmosphere,
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.480]  an environment for worldwide famine.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:36.480]  Right, and this drives the next part of the warfare.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.480]  Hop, human-osmotic pressure.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.480]  The human-osmotic pressure is the push in the pull of migration.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.480]  Right?
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.480]  Now, the globalists have been saying for years
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.480]  that they want to displace about 1.2 billion people in this.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:52.480]  And of course, Lara Logan has given me an earful of this.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.480]  You know how Lara is,
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.480]  Michael, are you paying attention to me?
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.480]  That's sort of the 1.2 billion people.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.480]  Well, the UN plan says about 2050,
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.480]  600 plus million in the U.S. alone.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:02.480]  How many?
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.480]  600 million they want to bring here.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480]  Yeah.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.480]  And you'll see clowns like Peter Zayn saying,
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.480]  you know, we've got plenty of room, right?
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.480]  Bottom line is this hop, this human-osmotic pressure,
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.480]  which human-osmotic pressure is driven by things like,
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.480]  well, it can be just a soft pressure economic-wise,
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.480]  like the draw and the push, let's say,
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.480]  if you're living in Mexico,
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.480]  you might want to work in the United States
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.480]  and live back in Mexico, actually, right?
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:27.480]  Many Mexicans still do that,
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.480]  and Americans do likewise, right?
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.480]  And then there's the hard pressures,
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.480]  like pandemic, famine, and war, which is like a fire.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.480]  You're going to run from the fire, right?
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.480]  And so interestingly, pandemic and famine and war,
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.480]  the more of these things,
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.480]  if you're going to get into the higher levels
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.480]  of studying warfare, first of all,
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.480]  you must study information war, period.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.480]  And you'll see so many things around you
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.480]  you couldn't believe that are happening
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.480]  once the curtains are opened.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.480]  And then studying famine and pandemic are essential.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.480]  Pandemic and famine and war are the triangle of death.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480]  They always go together.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.480]  If you get a big war, you'll always get pandemic and famine.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.480]  And if you get famine, you get a war.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.480]  That's right. It's the triangle of death.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.480]  I was saying this on an interview a couple of years ago
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.480]  and one of my kind readers, she said,
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.480]  you know, you say, pan for war, pandemic, famine, war,
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.480]  as if you made it up.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480]  And I said, I did.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.480]  And she goes, no, it's in the Bible.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.480]  I said, actually, you're right.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.480]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.480]  That's probably actually where I got it from.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.480]  The four horsemen, the fourth one is the fourth one.
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.480]  Why are powerful infrastructure groups?
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.480]  Why are powerful corporations pushing a climate of war and famine?
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.480]  Something you talk about all the time.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.480]  World domination.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.480]  They clearly want to reduce the world population for starters.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:44.480]  And this is an off-stated goal to even as low as 500 million people,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.480]  which would obviously, so if they're going to bring 600 million in here,
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.480]  it's just for a cool accusation move basically to kill us, right?
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.480]  And to take our property, which is very easy to do.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:55.480]  You can just tell the Haitians and the others,
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.480]  hey, go take those white people's property.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.480]  How many places in Africa?
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.480]  And that's the left.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.480]  Just like South Africa is priming anti-white race war.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.480]  Absolutely.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.480]  I mean, and that's the...
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.480]  So South Africa was a beta test.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.480]  And some other African countries as well.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.480]  And that's just the, that's just,
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.480]  the information war component is obviously part and parcel to everything.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.480]  They did it in Rhodesia too.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.480]  In the clouds.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  That's the whole thing, right?
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:23.480]  And so that's what Stalin did with the cool accusation.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:26.480]  First, we labeled everybody cool ox or Jews, Jews,
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.480]  or Poles had to wear the P for Polish, right?
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.480]  And so, first of all, you label your enemy, you mark your enemy,
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.480]  and then you say, hey, they stole your stuff.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.480]  Go take it from them, and it's yours.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.480]  And that's how you get away.
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.480]  Remember two years ago, Facebook put out an update with 12 people,
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.480]  myself and a few others, and said,
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.480]  these groups you're allowed to call for violence against.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480]  And people couldn't believe they did that,
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:49.480]  but they actually posted that as their official rules.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.480]  So they're beta testing that.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.480]  They called for violence against you openly.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.480]  They said, they said, you are not allowed to say anything positive
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.480]  about these 12 people, myself, Paul Watson again,
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.480]  again, as a few others, and you are,
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480]  but you are allowed to call for violence against them.
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:06.480]  I swear to God, does it sound real and pull it up?
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.480]  It's real.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.480]  That is, that's, that's stunning.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.480]  I mean, they're literally trying to call a hit squad in on you.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.480]  That's quite obvious.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.480]  But I think they were just beta testing to see if they get away with it.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.480]  They pulled it in two days.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.480]  Hmm.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.480]  Information war.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480]  You know, let's talk just for a minute.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.480]  Do you mind if I go off on a tangent about dog king's dog king?
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.480]  A dog king is an old strategy and information war to demoralize your enemies.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.480]  For instance, when the Swedish will kill a Norwegian king,
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.480]  they would make a literal dog into a king,
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:41.480]  like, you know, with a crown and everything.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.480]  And so the dog would have a translator
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:46.480]  and the dog's body language would give orders, right?
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.480]  So that's why they called him dog king's.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.480]  It was also done in Ethiopia and other places, right?
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.480]  So this had been done for centuries.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.480]  Caligula's horse, you know, whether he actually made a horse a senator, I don't know,
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.480]  or King Rama the 10th in Thailand made his poodle Fufu
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.480]  into a vice air marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.480]  He didn't, he had some problems with the Air Force.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:10.480]  So he made his poodle into actually a vice air marshal to demoralize the Air Force.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.480]  So you see, that's what's happening when you've got brain dead featherman up in Pennsylvania
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:17.480]  or you've got Biden, who's clearly a dog king.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.480]  You've got Harris, clearly a dog king.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.480]  Drag queen story times, critical race theory.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.480]  It's the purge of the military.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.480]  So you've got all these dog kings that demoralizes the people who don't do anything about it,
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.480]  who don't literally, you talk to Pashtun people in Afghanistan,
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.480]  they'll tell you what they would do.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.480]  I've talked to them.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.480]  They would, anyway, I'll get put in jail if I say what the Pashtun would say.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.480]  Stay there, I'll talk about dog kings when we come back, this is riveting stuff.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.480]  They want to get into you famously trapped cannibals and caught them.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.480]  Oh, that was epic.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]  You know, I was taking a...
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.480]  Well, stay there, stay there.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:54.480]  In fact, let's come in with a clip of I'll Eat My Neighbor straight ahead.

[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.480]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mies,
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.480]  famously said more than 150 years ago,
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.480]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.480]  because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.480]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:22.480]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.480]  and because of the facts that what we've covered is coming true.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.480]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down,
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.480]  if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting,
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.480]  you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:38.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.480]  and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.480]  If you decide we're done, we're done.

[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:39.480]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy,
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.480]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.480]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.480]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra

[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.480]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.

[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.480]  I will eat my neighbors.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.480]  I'm not letting my kids die.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.480]  I'm just going to be honest.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.480]  My superpower is being honest.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:32.480]  I've extrapolated this out and I won't have to for a few years since I got food and stuff,
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:34.480]  but I'm literally looking at my neighbors now and going,
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.480]  I'm ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.480]  You know what?
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.480]  I'm ready.
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:40.480]  My daughters aren't starving to death.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.480]  I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:44.480]  See, my superpower is being honest.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.480]  I'll eat your ass.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.480]  Okay, so that's good.
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:48.480]  And I said that was satire.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.480]  The media ran with it.
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.480]  But if they continue to collapse society,
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.480]  you've covered what's happening with the Dutch farmers everywhere else.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  The deliberate Canada, making them dump millions of gallons a month of milk.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:02.480]  I mean, this is a deliberate scarcity program by the ruling class of the planet.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.480]  You're an expert on that.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.480]  I mean, describe what you're seeing happening.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.480]  Right.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.480]  That's why I'm carrying this red handkerchief.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.480]  All the Dutch people know what this is.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:13.480]  That's the symbol of the resistance in Netherlands.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.480]  The weft, the world economic form, they call it the weft in Netherlands,
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.480]  is working to take their farms.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:24.480]  And right now they're trying to take another 3,000, there's 52,000 farms in Netherlands.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.480]  They own about 62%.
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.480]  Farmers own about 62% of the land.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.480]  And they're trying to take complete control.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:36.480]  And they've appointed the minister doing it to be the head UN guy running it worldwide.
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.480]  It's so predatory.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:38.480]  It's so illegal.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.480]  It is.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:40.480]  It's highly predatory.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.480]  In fact, when I leave you, I'm flying back to Netherlands.
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.480]  Because I'm going back on with Jordan Peterson over there.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480]  He went over with me.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.480]  I took him to a farm and to meet other people over there to see the situation.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.480]  It's a clear war on food.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.480]  It's not just a war on farmers.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.480]  It's a war on food to reduce the number of people.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:07.480]  And they're doing epic information war in Netherlands to persuade the Dutch people that the farmers are bad.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:15.480]  And in Netherlands, they blame the Stikstof pollution, which in Dutch language means nitrogen.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.480]  And next door in Germany, of course, Netherlands borders Germany.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:22.480]  In Germany, it's the carbon dioxide.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:24.480]  But in Netherlands, it's Stikstof.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.480]  Everything Stikstof is poison, they say.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.480]  Even though humans put off that.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.480]  And well, the nitrogen.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.480]  I mean, the nitrogen fertilizers, nitrogen fertilizers like ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate,
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480]  all these sorts of things.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:46.480]  You know, the Haber-Bosch process, which was first described in a thermodynamics book in 1903 by a guy named Fritz Haber, a German chemist.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:54.480]  He described the idea of taking the hydrogen off of natural gas and combining it with the nitrogen that we're breathing and making ammonia,
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:57.480]  which they could use for making explosives and fertilizers, right?
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.480]  And so in 1908, he finally got a little bit of ammonia to come out.
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480]  It was very difficult.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.480]  In a 1913, another guy named Bosch, Karl Bosch, also a German chemist, but he could take it to the industrial scale.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:16.480]  They started working on this at Ludwigshoff in Germany at BASF Plant, where I went to twice last year.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.480]  And by 1915, they were doing it on an industrial scale.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:25.480]  They were making ammonia at an industrial scale at Ludwigshoff and on the Rhine River at BASF Plant,
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.480]  which they could make a lot of explosives with that and fertilizers.
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:34.480]  And now you'll see at that time that's when the global population began to really explode.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:39.480]  Literally, anamodia began to explode as well because, you know, the same process.
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:45.480]  So they're cutting off carbon dioxide that plants breathe. They're trying to cut off nitrogen.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.480]  I mean, this is a direct attack.
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:51.480]  Absolutely. Before that, actually, we were using bird guano and bag guano for fertilizers,
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:56.480]  which actually is what is believed to have led to the Irish potato blight.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:03.480]  There may have been a fungus in the bird guano that was used for fertilizer for the Irish lump or potatoes.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.480]  Anyway, separate story.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:12.480]  And so right now, for instance, when Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 were blown up,
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:17.480]  Nord Stream 1, Nord Stream 2, when those things just got cut, that was it.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:24.480]  I mean, I had been warning, for much of last year, if BASF closes, that's Europe having a heart attack.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.480]  Then Mike Adams was warning about the same thing.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.480]  So the fertilizer is being cut off.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.480]  Oh, yeah, because you need that natural gas. It doesn't matter how much electricity you have.
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.480]  You can't make the nitrogen as fertilizers with electricity.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.480]  You have to have the natural gas, or in China, they'll use coal gas.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:46.480]  But you're not going to make it with nuclear power plants, right?
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:54.480]  So last year, I had a dinner with a retired CEO of a Dutch chemical company, and Jordan Peterson.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.480]  I arranged the dinner actually in Amsterdam, and his name is Hank Dahl.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:03.480]  Hank said, you know, countries like India and Brazil, where we get a lot of our protein, Brazil,
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.480]  are just not going to get enough fertilizers in 2023.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.480]  Here we are 2023.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:12.480]  So they're not going to get enough of their nitrogen as fertilizers this year.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:17.480]  And that's going to create an angular world. I've seen UN numbers that once the third world
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.480]  spends a certain amount of its paycheck on food, war always starts.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.480]  So when Klaus Schwab says the angular world will bring in our great reset,
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.480]  they're orchestrating the collapse, but they believe they'll pose as saviors during the collapse.
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:30.480]  Pandemic, famine, war.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:34.480]  Four horsemen, straight from the Bible, and the information war.
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.480]  Then when people are in this emotional state of being quite hungry,
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:43.480]  and not only that, they're handing out phones to many of the migrants
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.480]  who are coming across the border into the United States.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.480]  You can control these people with their phones, obviously, right?
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:54.480]  You can give instructions and say, hey, come to Alex Jones' place, destroy it.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:57.480]  You'll get paid if you even show up. First, they'll just get you to show up.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480]  We'll put some money on your phone.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.480]  And antipose a drill of that.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:01.480]  I'm sorry, sir?
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.480]  Antipose a test of that.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.480]  Oh, absolutely. Antifa, I was out with them in Hong Kong.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.480]  Believe it or not, Antifa was in Hong Kong.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:12.480]  I didn't even know much about Antifa until I was in Hong Kong,
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:15.480]  and there was Antifa people there learning how to fight and that sort of thing.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:20.480]  And so I was there in the fighting in Hong Kong for seven months until they kicked me out.
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.480]  But when you see Antifa then started using the umbrellas and different techniques
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:28.480]  that you would see in Hong Kong, they learned those techniques
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:32.480]  and they brought them back to when I left there, I went over to Portland.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:35.480]  And I was out in the fighting in Portland and watching these techniques.
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:38.480]  Now, when I went to the January 6th thing, I was there.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.480]  Actually, I didn't go inside. I sensed that it was a trap.
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.480]  I went to the door and I was like, you know what?
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:47.480]  Don't do this, because I could see a lot of agent provocateurs around.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.480]  I've been in so many fights in Thailand and the United States
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.480]  and also in Hong Kong watching agent provocateurs do things.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:54:00.480]  That group on January 6th was filled with agent provocateurs.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.480]  I'm always watching for people with antennas, right?
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:06.480]  Always when you're looking for who's operating with who.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.480]  When they start talking on their radios, they're usually looking for the guy they're trying to talk with.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:13.480]  So I was spotting the cells. There were a lot of cells.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:19.480]  And now it's coming out. Adam Schiff freaks out at the Tucker Carlson Granted Access January 6th footage.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.480]  Biden, again, is very scared of this.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:28.480]  January 6th, prisoners and their families petitioned Speaker McCarthy to release all 41,000 hours
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:31.480]  to crowdsourcing, but I'm glad Tucker's into it.
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:36.480]  He's really scaring the deep state. New video of REAPs hurling giant Trump sign at police on January 6th
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.480]  was never arrested like several Trump supporters who touched the same sign.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:46.480]  And notice as we go deeper and deeper into this, the information war is becoming more and more intense.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.480]  More and more dog kings.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.480]  Oh yeah, we got into dog kings and got cut off. Keep going with dog kings.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.480]  Dog kings is a demoralization technique.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:01.480]  A demoralization technique very effective, like Caligula apparently may have made his horse into a senator.
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:06.480]  Whether that actually happened is who knows. But anyway, that's a sort of dog king, right?
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.480]  So you basically put idiots in charge. You put the Biden, that sort of thing.
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:12.480]  And it demoralizes people that don't...
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.480]  Harris, Fetterman, this is all on purpose.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.480]  Exactly. Fetterman is obviously Fetterman.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:21.480]  And so that's a dog king. Now, it demoralizes the population itself,
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.480]  but also emboldens your enemies and saying, look, those Americans are whomever
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:27.480]  will actually follow whatever they're told to do.
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.480]  I thought that too. I thought the disastrous Afghan withdrawal
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.480]  was to make Russia feel strong to move into Ukraine.
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.480]  Yeah, that's what I think as well.
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:38.480]  And I was deeply involved in getting Americans out, by the way.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.480]  I knew. I mean, you go for 10 hours. There's just so much stuff.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.480]  Yeah, that was... you know, anyway, that's a whole separate story.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.480]  But the dog king thing is obviously... you know, there's a really important book
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:52.480]  that everybody should read called Rape of the Mind. Rape of the Mind is from 1954.
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:56.480]  And it goes through all... I've written three books on information work.
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.480]  They're only in Japanese, unfortunately.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.480]  So if you don't speak Japanese, then you're going to have a hard time.
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.480]  But if you read Rape of the Mind and you look around what just happened
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.480]  and what is happening right now, you will be vaccinated against...
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:12.480]  against mind rape, right?
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.480]  That's key. If you're aware of it, then it doesn't control you.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:18.480]  It's much harder, because you'll see the techniques like, you know,
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.480]  when you do martial arts, if they're about to put you in a chokehold,
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.480]  you can sense it and make countermeasures, right?
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.480]  And once you sense the techniques that they're using against you,
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:29.480]  if you read Rape of the Mind and read it very slowly,
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.480]  you will learn so much, you'll look around you and say,
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.480]  wait a minute, that's exactly what they locked us down.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:37.480]  You could drink all the alcohol you want, smoke dope, go ahead and smoke it.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.480]  But can't go to church, can't go to funerals, can't go with your family.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.480]  Just watch the TV and get brainwashed.
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:45.480]  That's right, Rape of the Mind.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.480]  1954 book, very...
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.480]  You know, I was over in Mateus Desmond, you know, the Belgian psychologist.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.480]  I was at his home last year with the famous Japanese journalist,
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:59.480]  Masako Ganao, who's probably watching now from Japan.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.480]  And we were in his home and I was looking at his books
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:06.480]  and I was looking for Rape of the Mind and there it was.
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.480]  And I said, do you mind if I photograph your books
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.480]  and he allowed me to... I think he's been on your show, hasn't he?
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:14.480]  And so he, you know, we talked about Rape of the Mind.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:16.480]  He's another person who's read it. It's a very important...
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:18.480]  We've got another hour coming up. I'm trying to shut up. We have the floor.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:21.480]  I want to get into the cannibal story.
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:23.480]  I want to get into the military stories.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:26.480]  I want to get into your smart guide.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.480]  He says, a citizen is a human. What do you think we should do to stop this?
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.480]  How is it going with the New World Order?
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.480]  Is it some levels? They seem to be winning, but a lot of levels they're not.
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:38.480]  I mean, just last week you've got Elon Musk confronting the World Government Summit
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.480]  saying you're failing, you're evil, you're going to kill us.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.480]  I mean, a lot of stuff's happening.
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.480]  Hour number three with our special guest, Michael Yon, straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:55.480]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023.
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:57.480]  And the world is an insane place.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.480]  World War III has already started.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.480]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.480]  There's mass censorship.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.480]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:07.480]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:11.480]  The good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its way.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.480]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:18.480]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast,

[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.480]  with massive, massive savings.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:16.480]  I can't be happy until I have seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:18.480]  Thee.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:21.480]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:25.480]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.480]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.480]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:32.480]  With the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.480]  Do as you please.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.480]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:40.480]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.480]  I would imply that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.480]  In the old I would teach to pray after me.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:50.480]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.480]  And then I'd get organized.
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:55.480]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.480]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.480]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.480]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:06.480]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:09.480]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.480]  If I were the devil I'd soon have families at war with themselves.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:14.480]  Churches at war with themselves.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:16.480]  And nations at war with themselves.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.480]  Until each in its turn was consumed.
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:25.480]  And with promises of higher ratings I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the blame.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:28.480]  The president of the United States is racist.
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.480]  If I were the devil I would encourage schools to refine young intellects
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:35.480]  but neglect the discipline of emotions just when those run wild.
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:38.480]  Within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.480]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.480]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:45.480]  Then from the schoolhouse.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.480]  And then from the houses of conscience.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:51.480]  And in his own churches I would substitute psychology for religion.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:55.480]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls.
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.480]  And church money.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.480]  If I were the devil I'd take from those who have
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.480]  and give to those who wanted
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.480]  until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.480]  I would caution against extremes.
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:10.480]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.480]  This isn't a game.
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:15.480]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:18.480]  I would convince the young that marriage is old fashioned
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:20.480]  that swinging is more fun
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:23.480]  that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:25.480]  And thus I could undress you in public
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:28.480]  and I could lure you into bed
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:31.480]  with diseases for which there is no cure.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:36.480]  In other words, if I were the devil I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:58.480]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:06.480]  The young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau,
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:11.480]  half of his government, are actually young nobleness of the world.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.480]  It's that we penetrate the cabinets.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.480]  The change is not just happening.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.480]  The change can be shaped by us.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.480]  We have to prepare for a more angry world
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:31.480]  and how to prepare to take the necessary action to create the fair world.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:34.480]  I see the need for a great reset.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.480]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:42.480]  and everything will be normal again.
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:46.480]  This is, let's say, fiction. It will not happen.
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:50.480]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:54.480]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.480]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:02.480]  of a comprehensive cyber attack
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:05.480]  which would bring to a complete halt
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.480]  to the power supply, transportation, hospital services.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.480]  Our society as a whole.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.480]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:26.480]  as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:53.480]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:58.480]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:02.480]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.480]  It takes commitment.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:07.480]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to info.warstore.com
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:10.480]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life

[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:53.480]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:54.480]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:58.480]  So again, please take action and go to infowarstore.com today.
[02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:17.480]  And I think, I've got a tiger by the tail to explain the sea. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:21.480]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:28.480]  You know, I've said that I know Michael Yanis for a decade. No, I've been on air for 28 years.
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:32.480]  I remember him in coverage in the Iraq war, the second one in 2003.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:38.480]  I mean, dude, I feel like I totally know you, but I just read your name and seen some of your reports over and over again.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:40.480]  Then when I saw you on Mike Adams a few months ago, I said,
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:43.480]  oh, this is the guy with Jordan Peterson with the great reporting from the Netherlands.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:47.480]  I've got to get him on. And then luckily you were here with Mike Yeshten.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.480]  You moved to Texas. That's amazing. But you're a humble guy.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:55.480]  But I think what you said is this, you were in special forces, you saw things, you realized information war was the next level.
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:58.480]  So you got into the information war as a journalist to tell the truth.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:02.480]  So people really respect you. A lot of the listeners are really excited you're on.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.480]  Most of them know who you are.
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:08.480]  Give us just as an American as a human, your view of the world and who the power players are
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:12.480]  and what's really happening in Ukraine and where you see this all going.
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:21.480]  First of all, the Ukraine war is at best terrible. I mean, it's a huge, huge error for the United States to be involved.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:24.480]  Not to get into all the details, but it's go ahead. You got the floor.
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:29.480]  Yeah. Yeah. You know, I lived in Poland for two. Let's go back to my special forces days.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:35.480]  I was on two different A teams in special forces as a green beret in both of those teams.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:41.480]  I can say it now. It was classified at the time, but we trained to parachute into Poland near a place called the alley stock.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:45.480]  To do certain things, to do sabotage and kill Russians and that sort of thing.
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:47.480]  And so it was a lot of training as you can imagine.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:50.480]  I went to language school for it. I went to two language schools for it.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:55.480]  And then later I lived in Poland after the after I was out of the army, which was unrelated.
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:08:02.480]  But the bottom line is, is I'm quite cognizant of things that go on in that region.
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:04.480]  You know the cultural terrain.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:09.480]  Very. You know, I've spent a lot. I spent six years in Europe or almost seven at this point.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:16.480]  And so, you know, I've been all over Europe and, and, and in fact, I'll be going back again in a few days to go back home with Jordan Peterson.
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:20.480]  Actually, and I may go to Ukraine. Actually, I'm not. Go ahead.
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.480]  I'm listening.
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:30.480]  Yeah, I may go to Ukraine. I'll probably, if I do, I'll probably go to Poland first and maybe Lithuania and, you know, talk with some of my contacts there and then Mosey on over to Ukraine.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.480]  It's unclear. I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:43.480]  As I'll kind of follow my nose when I get there. But as you can see, we are getting into a time of war that's going to unfold over a period of years.
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:45.480]  And one of the most.
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.480]  That's key. This is just the start.
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:55.480]  Oh, clearly. And again, you know, before I came on today, I called Mike Flynn, General Flynn, and I said, Hey, I'm going to go on with Alex today.
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:09:02.480]  What, you know, let's strategize some of the important things to talk about with you. Of course, he watches your show.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:09.480]  And one is, is just how close we are to a thermonuclear war. I mean, we are that close. Russia clearly feels threatened.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:21.480]  And if I were them, I mean, if China were putting troops in Mexico and in Canada on the borders, you know, in large numbers or any numbers, which they may be doing.
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.480]  The U.S. would hit them.
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:35.480]  I would. I mean, if Canada were starting to allow, you know, Chinese to station themselves across our border, Canada would become enemy territory, not Canadians, but Canada territory, of course.
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:43.480]  And of course, Ukraine, keep in mind, Ukraine and Russia have been fighting each other since forever, right? It's the white people Middle East is what I call it, right?
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  And Europe in general is always been a fractious area. It's only had this interagnum of peace post World War Two.
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:10:01.480]  Because of U.S. troops in particular, I used to be stationed there. We are obviously the ones that kept the peace there. We're pulling back now.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:11.480]  And now we're instigating. I mean, we clearly attack Nord Stream. Is there proof of that? You know, when it was still bubbling up, a lot of us thought, Hmm, who could have done that?
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:16.480]  Not the Russians, obviously, not the Germans. You know, that was their pipeline, right?
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:22.480]  And Biden and others had threatened to do something with Nord Stream. Now, Nord Stream is vital.
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:28.480]  When most of the Europeans wake up to what actually just happened with Nord Stream, I think a lot of them are still asleep.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:36.480]  They don't realize what just happened. We really just damaged them. And it's going to unfold as 2000, 2023 unfolds.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:46.480]  I saw a number where it was over $100 billion. The Germans have spent alone to hide the energy cost increase from the Germans.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:54.480]  And as you know, they can't do it forever. Another great book is When Money Dies. That's a good book to refer back to in the early 20s.
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:00.480]  So when you say this is the beginning, they're building permanent arms factories in Poland. They're saying it's probably a three year war.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.480]  That's in the Rand Corporation reports that you just alluded to. So how does this multi year war go?
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:13.480]  Well, as you know, with war, anybody who thinks they can predict which way a war can go is actually a fool.
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.480]  Anybody who can start, you know, thinks they can start a war and control it knows nothing about war.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:23.480]  Wars do what pandemics do. They get out of control and war makes war, right?
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.480]  They escalate.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:32.480]  War creates war, pandemic creates pandemic, famine creates famine, and they all create each other, right?
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:38.480]  Ukraine is one of the bread baskets of the world. And now it's very, you know, interrupted.
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.480]  Of course, many of the farmers are either fighting or they've left or they can't fight.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.480]  They're in the or their farmland has been bombed. They can't go back.
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.480]  So there's one piece off the chessboard, right?
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.480]  Now we've got Nord Stream interrupt, well, not interrupted, destroyed.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:01.480]  We've so many other interruptions are unfolding now. Conditions are being set for global famine and global famine.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:05.480]  The last time I think we saw, you know, a sincere global famine.
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:13.480]  If you want to call it that would be about 1816, the year without a summer, the volcanic eruption in 1815.
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.480]  It kind of unfolded in 1816 and 1817.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.480]  You know, because that was, you know, the atmosphere was filled with.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.480]  Was that Krakatoa or another one?
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.480]  No, it wasn't Krakatoa's Timbora, right?
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.480]  And so that was, you know, in 1815.
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.480]  There's a great book on it called The Year Without a Summer, actually.
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:35.480]  Interesting when they analyzed old paintings from the time period, not just that volcanic eruption, but others.
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.480]  The artists, the great artists would have a little bit more red in their sunsets.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.480]  So you can analyze, you know, art history actually has more purpose than.
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:48.480]  No, the plants don't grow as well. So Kloschwa Braggs, they're artificially doing this to collapse the old system, bringing anew.
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:51.480]  How does the elite, like you said, they're to control this?
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:54.480]  I mean, this is out of control.
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.480]  Yeah, notice how they're floating cannibalism now as well, right?
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:58.480]  You see the.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:12:59.480]  That's why I made the joke a few years ago.
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:01.480]  Yeah. Oh, you can see it coming.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.480]  When I saw you do that, I said, look, he sees it like normal.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:10.480]  You're usually so far ahead of everybody else's headlights that it sounds crazy, as you know.
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:14.480]  But it just turns out you just happen to be right before other people have picked up on it.
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:23.480]  And for instance, the cannibalism thing, you can see it getting floated around now in different magazines and newspapers and online.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.480]  New York Times.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:25.480]  That's right, New York Times.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:29.480]  Well, you're an expert on cannibals, and you tracked them and actually arrested them and stopped them.
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:36.480]  But I saw a pinning on a reporter for them like 20 years ago that within 15 days of a total breakdown, most people become cannibals.
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.480]  Within 10 days, most people will commit murder.
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:39.480]  Can you speak to that?
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.480]  Yeah, I mean, I didn't arrest any, but I certainly tracked some down.
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.480]  You know, the reason I tracked them down, I was taking a break in the action, actually, on cannibal hunting.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:58.480]  But when I was in Special Forces, I had some really great mentors, and I was told, study world religions, study cults, study anthropology,
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.480]  which sounded kind of strange because I'm like, hey, I'm a young green beret.
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.480]  I should be studying explosives, you know, and I should be studying warfare, right?
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:07.480]  But winning the hearts and minds is most important.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:11.480]  Yeah, but that upper level, that next level is information war, right?
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:16.480]  And so I began, I found out that I was very interested in anthropology when I started reading.
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.480]  Like I've read everything Joseph Campbell ever has written as an example.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.480]  He's dead on.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.480]  Yeah, he's right on.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:23.480]  Hero with a thousand faces.
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:24.480]  I read that three times.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.480]  I read all of his books.
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:26.480]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:30.480]  So, I mean, and I've traveled around the world quite a lot, well, about 90 countries.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:32.480]  Most of my life has been overseas.
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:37.480]  So, I was in India just taking a break and I was out photographing a tiger and that sort of thing.
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:41.480]  And I came across some cannibals and it was quite interesting.
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:45.480]  And then I realized some Americans were involved, including one from Houston, right?
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:47.480]  It took me a long time to figure out that.
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:51.480]  When I said arrested, I think you're tracking him led to him getting grabbed, right?
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:55.480]  Well, he's dead now, but he ended up being arrested when he tried to kill me, actually.
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.480]  But his name was Gary Stevenson.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:59.480]  He was born on December 3, 1950 in Houston.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.480]  His dad was an art.
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:06.480]  I've got all of his family photos and, you know, actual copies, the prints of his family, the originals.
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:10.480]  And I got his daughter to take a DNA test for me and this sort of thing.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.480]  I hunted down a lot of cannibals.
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.480]  But the bottom line is, it's interesting.
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:17.480]  It's a cult called Agwar, which has been around for at least 600 years.
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:22.480]  And they believe, I can explain this in like 15 seconds, the kernel of the religion.
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:27.480]  It's a subsect of Hinduism, but they believe God or the gods are perfect and created everything.
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.480]  And therefore, everything is perfect.
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:32.480]  So if you're disgusted by anything, you're disgusted by God.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:33.480]  So you should do everything.
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:36.480]  So one of the things they do is cannibalism, right?
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.480]  And they do it openly.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:38.480]  They won't hide it.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:41.480]  They'll do it like we would eat fried chicken.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:42.480]  I mean, they're very...
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:44.480]  Let's start at the beginning when we come back.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:45.480]  This is so interesting.
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:47.480]  The adventures you've been on, it's all on record.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:48.480]  You did all this stuff.
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.480]  What a life.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:50.480]  Stay there.
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:52.480]  I want to hear about this cannibal situation.
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:54.480]  Now he tried to kill you when we come back.
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.480]  Amazing.
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:01.480]  You can find Michael Yon's work at Michael InfoWars secret weapon is finally here.

[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:36.480]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:37.480]  They're already given to the pregnant women.
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:39.480]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:45.480]  80% increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:49.480]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.

[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:35.480]  Alex Jones's InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.480]  This is why they attack us.
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:41.480]  This is why we need your support because we tell the truth.
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:43.480]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:45.480]  Join the resistance.
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:46.480]  Buy products.

[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:49.480]  Share the links.
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:57.480]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:03.480]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:07.480]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.480]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:17.480]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vanda Waters detoxification supplement.
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:19.480]  That features natokinase.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.480]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:27.480]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:28.480]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:31.480]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:34.480]  And definitely with the vaccines, people are lower with the spike protein.
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:35.480]  They don't feel well.
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:37.480]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:40.480]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.480]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:50.480]  Isn't it interesting, natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.480]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:55.480]  And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:20:13.480]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:32.480]  Michael Yon, in the studio with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:33.480]  Just ribbiting stuff.
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:34.480]  You got so much knowledge.
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:35.480]  You got to interrupt by the break.
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:37.480]  Get back to you're in India photographing tigers.
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:40.480]  You learn about a cannibal cult and then wow.
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:41.480]  Oh yeah.
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:48.480]  I saw these missing Westerner signs all over the place and I actually encountered a cannibal weirdly.
[02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:51.480]  And long story short, I spent six.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:55.480]  I heard stories about one from Hawaii and or Texas.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:00.480]  And finally it took six months and just unbelievable things I learned.
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:05.480]  I studied everything I could about this cult trying to find out if Westerners were involved.
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:07.480]  For instance, I heard about some Italians.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:09.480]  I flew over to Italy and I found them.
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:12.480]  I physically met them and went to one of their homes and that sort of thing.
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:15.480]  I infiltrated one of the cults in California.
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:16.480]  There were some in California.
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:17.480]  I lived with them.
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:22.480]  But before all that, I tracked the first American down in Texas.
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:24.480]  I mean, he's from Texas.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:25.480]  He was from Houston.
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:28.480]  His dad was an army officer in World War II in Papua New Guinea.
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:34.480]  And anyway, his name was actually his super great grandfather was the one who brought Methodism to Texas.
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:37.480]  I have his autobiography in early 1800s.
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:38.480]  Wow.
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:39.480]  Anyway, so he read a book.
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:41.480]  His name was Gary Stevenson, the American cannibal.
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:43.480]  He read a book when he was 15 years old.
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:46.480]  He had polio in his left leg and it shriveled his leg, right?
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:49.480]  He got that in 1952 in June, right?
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:57.480]  There was a major outbreak of polio that year and the two worst places were Houston and Los Angeles and he was in Houston.
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:58.480]  And he got polio.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.480]  It came from a nice family.
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:03.480]  Most of the polio victims actually came from nice families.
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:05.480]  They weren't the poor Irish kids, that sort of thing.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.480]  They were actually people like Gary who came from a very wealthy family.
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:16.480]  And so Gary Stevenson tried to heal his leg and he started reading all sorts of books on diet.
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:24.480]  He read a book called Autobiography of a Yogi, which was the same book that Steve Jobs said that he read every year of his life
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:28.480]  since he was 19 years old and he gave away hundreds out of his funeral, right?
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:33.480]  And they ended up going to the same, they ended up at the same Hare Krishna Temple in San Francisco, weirdly.
[02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:35.480]  You can see Steve Jobs talking about this.
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:44.480]  And I've got Gary, I don't think that they ever knew each other or met each other, but they happened to cross the same circles and that sort of thing.
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:49.480]  And so anyway, Gary Stevenson became a Hare Krishna and then he finally left that.
[02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:51.480]  Hare Krishna are not cannibals, by the way.
[02:22:51.480 --> 02:23:00.480]  And then he ended up moving to Hawaii, Gary Stevenson did, and then finally he moved to India and he joined this cult called Agor.
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:06.480]  And that's where I got on his trail, tracked him down, he was drinking out of human skulls and he'd tell me things like,
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.480]  Michael, don't drink out of a woman's skull because it leaks.
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:13.480]  You know, he would tell me little bits of cannibal wisdom like that.
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:19.480]  They always drink out of a skull out of their left hand and they will drink actually their own urine, they drink blood,
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:29.480]  they make horns out of a human femur that they actually blow, they make Damaru drums from baby skulls and baby skin.
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:32.480]  And he had joined this cult. There's other Americans that have joined it.
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:40.480]  Anyway, I ended up going up to Tibet at one point and I was in Tibet in a market and I saw that they're selling these same sort of implements
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:44.480]  near Patala Palace, which is that big palace in Lhasa, right?
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:46.480]  Yeah, folks don't know Tibet as cannibalism.
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:52.480]  Yeah, I didn't know that until I went up there and I saw these implements and I was like, hmm, you know, these aren't Hindus.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:59.480]  And I started talking with some of the Tibetans about it and they're like, yeah, it's an old form of Buddhism and this sort of thing.
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:03.480]  Anyway, I tracked them down six times around the world. I tracked down many of these cannibals.
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:09.480]  Many Americans have joined Italians and others. It's fascinating.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:16.480]  With Gary Stevenson at one point, the first time I found him, I interviewed him for 18 days, right?
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:23.480]  And at one point I actually borrowed his passport, let's say, and I photographed it and I made a spreadsheet of all of his travels.
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:29.480]  And he had about 70 or 80 entries and exits from countries.
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:31.480]  How was he paying for all this?
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:37.480]  He got an insurance settlement. He got hit by a Chinese guy, he said, in Hawaii on a bicycle.
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:41.480]  Gary, with his leg, despite his leg, he could write a bicycle.
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:47.480]  And in fact, I flew to Hawaii at one point, got his name changed records, found people that it wasn't found.
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:49.480]  So what ended up happening to him?
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:55.480]  He's dead. And I think he was poisoned. It's unclear at this point. I have his autopsy.
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:02.480]  In fact, I sent a spy back over to check some things out and I think he was poisoned, but I'm unclear on that.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:06.480]  How the hell do people get involved in a cannibalism cult?
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.480]  Well, he was trying to heal his leg and find supernatural powers.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:16.480]  He went through this, Steve Jobs went through a lot of, let's say, experimental dietary habits, right?
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:20.480]  A lot of people do, you know, protein powder to work out in the gym or whatever.
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:23.480]  Most of us have done something like that, right? But not cannibalism.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:29.480]  So Gary, I called him GTC Gary the cannibal and he'd say, actually, that's an agori.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:37.480]  Actually, that's Aslan. That guy's a fake agori, but that's actually at Varanasi.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:42.480]  That's near where I first met Gary the cannibal GTC. That's on the other side of the river from Varanasi, right?
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:44.480]  I call that the dog side of the Ganges.
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:47.480]  How do you choose what you're going to cover? Because you've done so many things.
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:49.480]  I'm free. You know, I'm a free man.
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:55.480]  And so the last time I actually worked for somebody for a paycheck, I think it was Michael Jackson when I was in school.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:59.480]  After the army and I was in college in California and I was offered a job with him.
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:02.480]  So I'd just do my calculus homework at Neverland.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:10.480]  And then after that, I went off, started a business in Poland and next thing you know, I was a work correspondent and that sort of thing.
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:15.480]  So, yeah, actually, I always wanted to be a physicist and then I figured out, you know, I have too much energy.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:17.480]  I can't sit still long enough to do so.
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:22.480]  So pulling back to World War III, what is the exit strategy?
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.480]  Is there any way to stop this because the Russians are going to give up?
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:28.480]  The West isn't going to give up. It's escalating.
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:30.480]  I mean, how does this end?
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:34.480]  Well, we have, I call it August, the Occupational Government of the United States.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:37.480]  And we are clearly occupied.
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:40.480]  We are clearly what we were fighting against.
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:42.480]  We have become that thing, right?
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:45.480]  We have no borders. We're in Texas now.
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:48.480]  I've been down on this border quite a lot on the Mexican and Texas side.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:54.480]  I've got trash bags filled with passports of migrants who discard them in the Mexican side.
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.480]  And there's no border and Governor Abbott will sit here.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:04.480]  I was on the Mexican side last year and Governor Abbott is talking about all these border control measures they're doing.
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:12.480]  I'm like, I'm right at the Rio Grande on the Mexican side, watching them cross the river in our National Guard, Texas National Guard.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:17.480]  By the way, I'm no fan of Abbott, but in fairness, he captures them. The feds just let them go.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:21.480]  He does, but he does, but here's the thing about Abbott.
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:23.480]  He's making it sound like they're doing something.
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:25.480]  Instead of saying nothing's being done.
[02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:27.480]  Instead of saying, I don't have power, it's a federal issue.
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:30.480]  He's making it sound like we're actually doing something.
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:36.480]  They'll have troops walk around with a rifle acting like we're in control.
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:43.480]  And we're not. If you actually physically go to the border yourself, you'll see there's these little tiny swaths of some National Guard
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:48.480]  and the other 99% of the border is wide open and people are just crossing everywhere.
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:53.480]  And even when they cross right by the National Guard, the National Guard will put them on the buses and they go to...
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:54.480]  So what's the solution?
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.480]  Well, we need a new government. That's clear.
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.480]  We're not going to do it when you have dog kings in charge.
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.480]  Remember, the dog king did not get there by himself.
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:10.480]  He is a dog. Biden obviously did not. This obviously was a sham election.
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:16.480]  I was in Arizona for that election with Kerry Lake.
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:20.480]  The two polling stations I went to, I'd just been overseas for four months.
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:23.480]  I flew straight to Maricopa County.
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:29.480]  And the two polling stations I went to had problems with the voting machines, with the elections that we just had.
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.480]  Well, they gave them balance in Republican districts that wouldn't work.
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:35.480]  Yeah, the voting machines weren't working.
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:39.480]  So there was people that couldn't vote or they had to go far away and they couldn't go and that sort of thing.
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.480]  And that happened to many of the voting, but the two that I went to, the voting machines weren't working.
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:47.480]  Obviously, I couldn't go to them all.
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:52.480]  I did a soil sample, you might say, and other people were giving me their reports.
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:55.480]  And it was just another stolen election. It's clear as day.
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:20.480]  Stay with us.
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:27.480]  Ultimate Bone Broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock. Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.

[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:51.480]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:57.480]  But now, I sign the last books, you get them right now.
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:02.480]  You want to beat the New World Order? You want to stop their globalist agenda? Well, so do I.

[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:09.480]  and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:13.480]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.

[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:24.480]  but I'm not going to back down, and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:28.480]  So please, keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy,

[02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:13.480]  and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:16.480]  to the companies that we were already using.

[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:04.480]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:09.480]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true. They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:12.480]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars. None of that's true.
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:15.480]  It's all being appealed. They want you to think Infowar's is dead.
[02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:20.480]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowar's, we've got years and years of appeals,
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:22.480]  and we will not be taking off the air.
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:26.480]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:29.480]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.

[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:56.480]  Some of you have. Do not let the globalists brainwash you. Go to infowarstore.com and get us on the air.
[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:25.480]  To God, that is Alex Jones.
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:57.480]  And then they make the minister doing it like the head of the new UN food program to cut the food off.
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:02.480]  I mean, it's like, it's like Biden cutting off the Keystone Pipeline that would have cut gas prices,
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:06.480]  they say like 20% at least and given 100,000 jobs total.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.480]  I mean, it's like hard to believe they're at war with us.
[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:11.480]  They're literally at war with us.
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:16.480]  And by the way, again, when you see this red handkerchief, that's a sign of the Dutch farmer resistance.
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:17.480]  And that's why I carry it with me.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.480]  And I'm going back over there again soon, maybe Jordan, the dairy farmers watching this now.
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:25.480]  And Jordan talked about, I took Jordan Peterson to see Jordan, the farmer.
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:28.480]  He's one of the main resistance leaders there.
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:34.480]  And Jordan talked about how the Dutch government so controls all of their inputs.
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:38.480]  They know every gallon or every liter of diesel they get there.
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:41.480]  Every one of his cows has an ear tag.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:44.480]  So they went along with the surveillance, they're using it for control.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:46.480]  Lesson is don't opt into this.
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:48.480]  And so they're completely controlled.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:50.480]  Like you can't have an extra cow.
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:51.480]  They'll know.
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:54.480]  For instance, the milk truck that comes every day, I've been over at his farm quite a lot.
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:57.480]  The milk truck comes, there's the milk truck, you know, it hooks it up.
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:00.480]  It knows exactly how many liters it got out, that sort of thing.
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:01.480]  Everything is controlled.
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:07.480]  And so it's interesting when I was with, you've heard of gleaning before, gleaning from the Bible, gleaning.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.480]  It's interesting.
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:13.480]  I was with Jordan and Jordan said, you know, he's like one of those super tall Dutch people he's talking to me.
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.480]  He's like, you know, Michael, they've started gleaning here again.
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:18.480]  Gleaning is from the Bible.
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:22.480]  It's when people go and, you know, when the crops are not completely pulled out of it,
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:27.480]  when people harvest their crops, let's say onions and two to three percent of the onions are left in the field,
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:29.480]  people will come and collect those crops.
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:30.480]  That's called gleaning.
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.480]  There's a famous painting in France about gleaning that was highly political.
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:37.480]  You may have seen it before the three ladies in the field and that sort of thing.
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:41.480]  Anyway, he told me that people are starting to glean again in Netherlands.
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:43.480]  He saw him gleaning right down.
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:48.480]  He has a dairy farm, so not gleaning on his farm, but down the road there were Dutch people gleaning.
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:50.480]  He said he'd never seen that in his whole life.
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:52.480]  He heard his parents talking about it.
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:59.480]  He heard his grandparents talking about it from the war, but he had never seen it with his own eyes until 2022.
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:02.480]  And now the gleaning is starting actually in the United States now.
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:07.480]  It's when people go to the farms and start either stealing crops, which is not really gleaning, that's stealing,
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:11.480]  or they start just taking crops that weren't harvested, right?
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:12.480]  And now this is starting.
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:14.480]  This is one of those symptoms of famine.
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:17.480]  I read a lot of books on pandemic and famine.
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:19.480]  Look how much eggs cost now.
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:20.480]  Sir?
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:21.480]  Eggs.
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:22.480]  Oh, eggs, exactly.
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  I bought a lot of eggs, dehydrated eggs in 2020 and I've still got them.
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:31.480]  I bought a ton of them because I saw where I was going with eggs.
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:40.480]  You know, if you study these things enough, they become less difficult to predict because there are a lot of patterns.
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:45.480]  And as she repeats, why does the ruling global class think they'll get away with this?
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.480]  Because the good news is they thought they'd carry this out and be the savers.
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:51.480]  They're not carrying it out and being the savers.
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:52.480]  People know they're behind it.
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:53.480]  Yeah.
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:37:00.480]  And you know, again, I mentioned earlier the famous Japanese journalist, Masako Ganaja, was recently over in Davos.
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:04.480]  And you notice she was the one who tracked down Klaus Schwab.
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:10.480]  And Klaus Schwab, and she was, you know, trying to ask him questions and he got into his hybrid car, which was not an electric car.
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:11.480]  And he drove away.
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:16.480]  Interestingly, though, if you notice how much security he did not have, right?
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:18.480]  He was basically naked out there.
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:20.480]  And why would Klaus Schwab?
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:22.480]  He's clearly a dog king himself.
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:24.480]  That thick German accent.
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:26.480]  He's been there since the beginning, almost the beginning.
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:28.480]  And he's a front man.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:30.480]  He's clearly a sort of a bag man.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:32.480]  As is Yuval.
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.480]  You can see that these guys are like actors and professional wrestling.
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:39.480]  The perfect evils, the perfect like, look at this guy.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:41.480]  He's like right out of a movie.
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:42.480]  And he is.
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:45.480]  He's clearly part of the information game.
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:49.480]  He is not the leader of WEF, World Economic Forum.
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:50.480]  I agree.
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:52.480]  So what do you expect is going to happen?
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:56.480]  Give us your prognosis near and midterm.
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:57.480]  It's going to get bloody.
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:58.480]  I mean, that's obvious.
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:01.480]  It's because it's all about conditions, right?
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:07.480]  And one, again, one thing about wars is that they always go in unpredictable ways.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:11.480]  And people, you know, they have, World Economic Forum has started a war.
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:14.480]  At this point, they will not be able to turn it off.
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.480]  And at some point people will target them.
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.480]  I'm not saying to target them, obviously.
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:21.480]  But the world's a two-way street.
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:23.480]  Yeah, the world is a two-way street.
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:24.480]  It's going to get kinetic.
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:26.480]  It's already kinetic on us.
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.480]  And it's going to get way out of control because that's what wars do.
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:33.480]  Well, look at the left defunding police.
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.480]  And now you see leftist politicians on a daily basis being murdered in their homes.
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:41.480]  Bishops, congresspeople, mayors, I mean, it's every day they're being murdered.
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:43.480]  What did they think was going to happen?
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:45.480]  Like they're going to cut police to kill us.
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:46.480]  What happens to them?
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:47.480]  Exactly.
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:48.480]  Yeah.
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  Yeah.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:51.480]  Why do they think they're immune from what they do?
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:54.480]  Like anybody that has chivalry, chivalry is not a wimpy thing.
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:56.480]  Let's leave the women and children out of this.
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:38:57.480]  They're like, oh, you're a wimpy.
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:38:58.480]  We'll get rid of chivalry.
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:38:59.480]  No, we don't want women and children targeted.
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:02.480]  Why do they think getting rid of chivalry is so cool?
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:04.480]  Like wimps didn't develop chivalry.
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:05.480]  They did it because they were honorable.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:06.480]  Right.
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:07.480]  Right.
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.480]  Well, the people that we're fighting against, they're clearly setting conditions for global famine.
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:17.480]  And setting conditions for massive migration into Europe and the United States.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:20.480]  The migration into Europe is almost complete.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:21.480]  But it's still ongoing.
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:27.480]  For instance, I was in Morocco about a year and a half ago with Chuck Holton, the famous war correspondent friend of mine.
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:33.480]  And you can see there's two actually EU cities, Spanish cities in Africa.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:35.480]  They're in Suta and Malilla.
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:36.480]  They're in Morocco.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:40.480]  And so you'll see there's actually Spanish cities in Morocco, right?
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.480]  And so if you can get into Suta or Malilla, you're actually in the EU.
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:48.480]  So that's one of the places where migrants are weaponized, right?
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:54.480]  And so that whenever Morocco is upset with Spain or whatever, they'll push some more migrants into Suta.
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:55.480]  I went there.
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:56.480]  I went to the wall and whatnot.
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:39:59.480]  Likewise over with Turkey and Greece.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:04.480]  I was over on that wall with Chuck Holton on the Turkey-Greece border wall.
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:05.480]  They have a border wall there.
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:13.480]  Actually, the Greek, you might call them resistance, we went and sat at a little village cafe in Greece right next to the wall.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:17.480]  And these really swarly men came in and they were clearly the resistance.
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:21.480]  They started showing us photos of their weapons and their radios and whatnot.
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:27.480]  And they said, you know, our government is building that wall not to defend us against the migrants,
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:31.480]  but to defend the migrants against us, because we're not letting them into Greece.
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:34.480]  We're not going to let them around our families.
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:35.480]  They're cutting down the trees.
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:41.480]  For instance, they complained about cutting down these olive trees that are 300 years old.
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:44.480]  You won't believe how many wars are started over trees.
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:45.480]  People love them now.
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:47.480]  People love those trees.
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:49.480]  Oh, they're 300 years old olive trees.
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:55.480]  You know, when I was in Afghanistan, I was with the British and we were taking sniper fire every day.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.480]  And I was like, why can't we kill the sniper?
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:01.480]  I mean, and we were intercepting his icons.
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:02.480]  It's like we know where he's at.
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:03.480]  He's doing icons, right?
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:09.480]  And the reason he was shooting at us, he had gone to Pakistan and bought a sniper rifle,
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:12.480]  because the British had cut down some of his fruit trees, pomegranate.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:17.480]  I don't read about Iraq when the military cut out a bunch of trees on the Tiger's Euphrates.
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:19.480]  That creates a whole uprising.
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:21.480]  Oh, they'll straight up go to war for it.
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:25.480]  And finally, actually, one of the soldiers in the unit that I was with,
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.480]  it was a small as in Sangin, actually, the most dangerous district in all of Afghanistan,
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:31.480]  out of about 400 districts.
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:33.480]  And one of the British got shot in the head.
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:35.480]  He was killed, I mean, by that sniper.
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:39.480]  I mean, at one point I was like, why don't we pay for the tree or kill him?
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:43.480]  I mean, we cut down these trees for Fields of Fire, the British did, right?
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:46.480]  And I said, why don't we just pay for the trees or kill him?
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:48.480]  One or the other, he's going to kill us.
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.480]  And finally, he killed one of the soldiers.
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  And the British commander was like, we would like to pay for the trees,
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:58.480]  and we offered to pay for the trees, but there's a schedule back in London
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:02.480]  about how much you're able to pay for the trees, and it's not making him happy.
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:03.480]  That's the same thing.
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:06.480]  Those trees are their livelihood, just like the Dutch were ready to go to war
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:08.480]  because they're taking their cows and killing them.
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:09.480]  Straight up.
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:12.480]  And that's why, again, that's why Stalin went for the Kulaks.
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:17.480]  He went for the farmers and had the whole lot of more in 32, 33, 1932, 33.
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:20.480]  He was going after the farmers because the farmers are very...
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:25.480]  Why did this thing just happen in East Palestine and Ohio?
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:26.480]  I asked Sam Faddis.
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:28.480]  I just called him when I was in the green room.
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  What is going on?
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  He's a retired CIA guy.
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:35.480]  Why did this happen in East Palestine?
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:36.480]  I mean, was it the rivers?
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:37.480]  Was it what?
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:41.480]  And I don't know, but I also just called the journalists who's up there now.
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:43.480]  Jonathan, he might be watching.
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.480]  And his theory is that it's a big, highly...
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:49.480]  It's Amish farmland.
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:50.480]  That's his theory.
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:51.480]  Come back.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:43:20.480]  I thought the situation in Ohio was straight ahead with our great guess.

[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:16.940]  Final segment with Michael Yand then drew Hernandez takes over in the fourth hour had
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:20.940]  owned short of three p.m. central the war room, but you were explaining a carver matrix
[02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:27.820]  in a military training, basically hit list of priority targets, primary targets and explaining
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:31.580]  looking at this. It's obvious warfare. And I even have the Wall Street Journal, everybody
[02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:36.700]  admitting the government admits power stations, record levels, food processing, farms, everything.
[02:47:36.700 --> 02:47:43.220]  And you talk about Ohio, just looking at that. What is your training tell you sabotage, you
[02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:47.660]  know, as somebody who trained to parachute into Poland and do sabotage. I mean, it just
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:54.100]  reeks of sabotage. One question I have is why East Palestine? Because, you know, in
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:58.860]  the carver matrix, something called the carver matrix, which is a planning tool for sabotage.
[02:47:58.860 --> 02:48:02.740]  When you're trying to assess which targets that you have the assets to hit or the ability
[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:09.020]  to hit or which ones you should prioritize, the carver matrix is criticality, accessibility,
[02:48:09.020 --> 02:48:14.140]  recuperability, effect and recognizability, right? And so, and you're going to want to
[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:18.460]  hit critical nodes. A critical node is something that if you take this out, it takes out something
[02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:22.620]  important, right? So, you want to use, as in business, the least amount of resources
[02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:28.340]  to get the most effect, right? And so, why East Palestine if it was, in fact, an attack,
[02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:34.140]  which I think that it was. That's my sense anyway. And why? So, you know, I was talking
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:41.940]  We know Antifa is attacking railways everywhere. Yeah, yeah. But why East Palestine? And because
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:46.660]  you could have attacked it in other places, the same train, right? Was it just accidentally
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:51.020]  that it happened there? You know, the fire had started earlier. But, you know, that is
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:59.460]  heavy Amish territory, heavy Dutch, I mean, Amish farm territory. So, maybe I don't know.
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:03.420]  I'm just floating an idea. I don't know why they would have done it there. The waterways,
[02:49:03.420 --> 02:49:07.980]  what it could have been targeting the farmers there, in particular the Amish, who we see
[02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:12.940]  and have been in the news quite a lot lately for, you know, because farmers will tend to
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:17.340]  be farmers. That's why I get along with farmers in every country I go to. Some of the first
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:21.580]  people I go to to pick up atmospherics is farmers. I go to the farmers because I get
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:25.700]  along with farmers and I get along with Taliban farmers. I get along with... Well, Thomas
[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:30.260]  Jefferson said it shouldn't be lawyers or politicians, it should be farmers. He said
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:34.940]  farmers are civilization. Did he say that? Brilliant. I'm paraphrasing him, but yeah.
[02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:41.260]  Oh, I mean, that... He said yeoman farmers should fill Congress. Literally every country
[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:45.060]  I go to when I'm trying to pick up atmospherics, I'm like, okay, let's go talk with some farmers,
[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:49.660]  you know? And because that's where you'll get a pulse, right? And I get along with farmers
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:54.340]  in every culture, even Taliban farmers I get along with. You know, I can tell you a lot
[02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:59.980]  of Taliban farmer stories. But the bottom line is, why did it happen in East Palestine?
[02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:06.900]  Were our Amish farmers being targeted? I don't know. I've got to head over to Netherlands
[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:11.100]  and then I may head back over there, or I may head to Ukraine after that. But this is
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:14.740]  gnawing on me. Maybe I'll have to send somebody up there. Well, they're both close. Maybe
[02:50:14.740 --> 02:50:19.540]  go to Ukraine first and then to the Netherlands. I've got to go to Netherlands because I've
[02:50:19.540 --> 02:50:23.580]  got to go with Jordan Peterson. You've got a promise to come on when you're in Ukraine.
[02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:30.260]  Either way, every country I go to, which is a lot. Wow, keep going. Oh, well, yeah. I
[02:50:30.260 --> 02:50:34.660]  mean, so why did that happen there? Anyway, Carver Matrix, you see so many of these plants
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:40.100]  that are being hit. You see so many interruptions that are happening with electrical grid or
[02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:45.660]  whatnot. And this is something that people who've studied sabotage and these sorts of
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:50.300]  campaigns for years have often been concerned about with the United States. We're highly
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:56.900]  vulnerable because we are an open society. I mean, as Matt Bracken, whom you know, he
[02:50:56.900 --> 02:51:01.380]  went to Dairy and Gap with me recently, a great former SEAL officer. He was great in
[02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:06.060]  the jungle. He talked about the other day, you know, if you want to take out your neighbor's
[02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:10.140]  electricity, you just shoot his transformer on his power pole. I mean, that's how vulnerable
[02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:17.420]  we are, right? We're highly vulnerable to sabotage and food in particular. Now, in many
[02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:22.300]  ways, we're very resilient. In other ways, we're very non-resilient. If you have big
[02:51:22.300 --> 02:51:25.820]  level players that can take out your energy and your pipelines and that sort of thing
[02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:32.740]  like Nord Stream, take out your ability to hit us with bureaucratic obstacles. This is
[02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:36.340]  one of the things they're doing with the Dutch and the Germans and the Belgians, hitting
[02:51:36.340 --> 02:51:41.820]  them with bureaucratic obstacles, adding more cost and time and money to their, to their
[02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:43.660]  operating. And again, what's the end game of the ruling
[02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:48.180]  class to want to make the people poor? Take control of the food supply for starters.
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:53.740]  So it's by control. And with this, remember, these all play into a comprehensive war strategy
[02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:58.380]  that they openly talk about. Remember, evil will tell you what it's going to do. Mine
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:02.500]  comp. I mean, he wrote it in a book, right? I mean, evil will sit there and tell you,
[02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:06.100]  I'm going to burn down your house and then it'll go and burn down your house. The World
[02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:11.700]  Economic Forum, remember, the World Economic Forum and the CCP, the Chinese, Chinese Communist
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:16.900]  Party are co-sanguinated. They are inseparable. You can't talk about them as if they joined
[02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:22.820]  forces. They are one, right? They may break up later and fight each other, but they operate
[02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:27.980]  as what they are. They have same mission. Oh, yeah, same mission. And they're just totally
[02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:31.860]  entwined, right? The Dutch government, as an example, is completely captured and is
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:36.820]  utterly captured. And so one of the things that they'll first offer to do, which they
[02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:42.180]  offer to the United States, is to buy the farms, right? Or to buy the Dutch farmers,
[02:52:42.180 --> 02:52:47.380]  or the Germans, right? Or the British. Interestingly, when I was in Netherlands last year, you
[02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:50.980]  know, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has put hundreds of millions of dollars into
[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:54.820]  something called picnic. If you've heard of that food distribution, one of them burned
[02:52:54.820 --> 02:52:58.660]  down when I was there. I went to the fire the next morning. It was still smoldering
[02:52:58.660 --> 02:53:03.460]  and then two more burned down. I was about to say, what happens when the people start
[02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:08.460]  using the same tactics? Yeah. When the third one burned, it became, you know, look, Carver
[02:53:08.460 --> 02:53:12.620]  works both directions. You know, it obviously becomes suspicious. And that's the key. I've
[02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:16.220]  never called for violence. What I've done is identify the globals or operations. I'm just
[02:53:16.220 --> 02:53:20.700]  going to let the public decide what they want to do. Right. Ultimately, I think the world
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:25.220]  economic form members are getting antsy as more and more of them realize, hey, we're
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:30.660]  a bunch of rich people and we're highly vulnerable. By the way, I watched Body Language. I've
[02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:35.140]  been watching Klaus Schwab for 20 years. He looks scared now. And all their body language
[02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:39.460]  does not look confident. He does. Did you see how he looked when Misako Gunaha, the Japanese
[02:53:39.460 --> 02:53:44.740]  journalist approached him? Oh, yeah. He looked actually, what would you think about his Body
[02:53:44.740 --> 02:53:52.500]  Language then? Just isolated alone. Yeah. He was naked. No real security or anything.
[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:57.620]  Yeah. If he's if he's such a heavy hitter, why in the same with Greta Thunberg, she was
[02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:02.460]  there and Misako is there and followed her. She got lost on the way to the train station.
[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:06.700]  Greta could not find it. There was nobody there to escort her. They were just lost in
[02:54:06.700 --> 02:54:09.740]  doubt. I think it's a combination of they're just front people. I agree they're not as
[02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:17.180]  powerful. They're not, you know, head cards in the deck, but they're also overconfident
[02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:21.340]  because they've never been opposed. So when they finally get opposed, they like, whoa,
[02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:24.620]  someone's even talking to me. They don't know what to do. They're getting some pushback
[02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:30.780]  now. The curtain is being drawn back and people start to realize, hey, that guy, you know,
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:35.540]  you know, Switzerland, a lot of the Swiss are rising up against them as well, right?
[02:54:35.540 --> 02:54:40.020]  It's not like all the Swiss are behind this. They're not. Misako was down there interviewing
[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:46.380]  Swiss farmers galore after this and before. And they are very angry about what's happening
[02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:52.460]  and why Davos is being used as their sort of little headquarters. Why do you think Davos
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:55.900]  has been so arrogant about being in control? Obviously as a front group, but they're the
[02:54:55.900 --> 02:54:59.780]  spokesperson for the big corporations that are doing this. We penetrate the cabins. We
[02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:03.760]  run your life. You'll own nothing. You don't like it. Why was he trying to act like a James
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:10.380]  Bond villain? I think I think he was in some way selected. Look at his accent. That accent
[02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:15.420]  that Klaus Schwab has greats on Americans in particular. I've explained this to people
[02:55:15.420 --> 02:55:20.340]  from other countries like Japan. Like you might not understand it's not a German accent.
[02:55:20.340 --> 02:55:26.460]  It's that particular German accent is right out of a Nazi movie to us, right? He is that
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:31.140]  villain. The things that he says, the way that he says them, the arrogance. We hate
[02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:37.340]  arrogance. We're Americans. We just don't like arrogance, right? And and and arrogance
[02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:44.540]  is whenever you meet the West people, they're all arrogance. I haven't never saw it like
[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:48.820]  over the top. They think they're in charge and they have been for now. But once this
[02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:52.740]  thing kicks off and there's who's going to guard them, they're not going to be able
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:56.380]  to walk around freely anymore. They're not going to be able to. Well, that's right. They're
[02:55:56.380 --> 02:56:01.300]  trying to create this grave for us. They've dug their own grave. Yeah, wars always get
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:04.940]  out of control and they never go the way that you think that they'll go. This thing that's
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:09.540]  kicking off now with Ukraine and you know, CCP is obviously throwing in with Russia
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:16.900]  and which obviously CCP is an enemy of the United States. Hugely. One one one actually
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:21.220]  criticism I have is Trump. I thought he was a dove on CCP compared to what I would have
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:26.660]  been doing. I mean, but I like the way Trump stood up on the border. I'm disgusted with
[02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:33.220]  his stand on the Vax or the fake Vax, the poison. But he did stand up to China to some
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:38.460]  level, right? But not enough. China is a is a is a lethal enemy of the United States
[02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:43.140]  and they love to demean their enemies. They love to dog King people. And that's clearly
[02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:46.380]  like that's clearly what they're doing. That's why they want to get rid of the Dalai Lama
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:51.660]  and everything else, right? The Chinese love to humiliate enemies.
[02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:57.100]  Michael Yon in closing. How do people find your amazing reporting? I'm on locals.com.

[02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:58.660]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.660 --> 03:00:05.060]  In 1863 Republican President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which
[03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:10.460]  freed slaves held in the Confederate States. The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution
[03:00:10.460 --> 03:00:17.180]  took effect in December 1865 and finally ended slavery throughout the United States. That
[03:00:17.180 --> 03:00:23.500]  year the Ku Klux Klan was founded. Historian Eric Foner observed that basically the Klan
[03:00:23.500 --> 03:00:28.500]  was the military muscle behind the agenda of the Democratic Party, the plantation owner
[03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:34.180]  class and all those truly afflicted with a mental disorder that is racism. The Klan's
[03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:39.660]  purposes were to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction.
[03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:45.460]  To destroy the Republican Party's infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction State, reestablish
[03:00:45.460 --> 03:00:51.220]  control of the black labor force and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern
[03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:57.060]  life. By any means necessary the Klan sought this agenda by threats and violence including
[03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:59.580]  the murder against black and white Republicans.
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:04.620]  There are a lot of people who wrote these eulogies for Senator Byrd in the newspapers
[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:10.540]  and I read a bunch of them and they mentioned that he once had a fleeting association with
[03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:15.300]  a Ku Klux Klan and what does that mean? I'll tell you what it means. He was a country boy
[03:01:15.300 --> 03:01:19.900]  from the hills and hollows of West Virginia. He was trying to get elected. He was fiercely
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:29.380]  devoted as you've all heard to his principles. Even once he became power, he always spoke
[03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:36.180]  truth to power. Standing up for the people he proudly was part of. You know folks, lynching
[03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:41.740]  is pure terror. Enforcing the lie that not everyone belongs in America and not everyone
[03:01:41.740 --> 03:01:48.140]  is created equal. Pure terror to systematically undermine hard fought civil rights. Innocent
[03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:55.260]  men, women, children hung by noose from trees. Bodies burned, drowned, castrated. They're
[03:01:55.260 --> 03:02:01.100]  crimes. Trying to vote. Trying to go to school. Trying to own a business. Lensed for simply
[03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:10.220]  being black. Nothing more. With white crowds, white families gathered to celebrate the spectacle.
[03:02:10.220 --> 03:02:23.100]  These are the innocent lives taken during another tragic mass shooting in America this
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:29.020]  year. Arielle Anderson, Brian Frazier and Alexandria Verner. Police identify the gunman as 43-year-old
[03:02:29.020 --> 03:02:33.940]  Anthony Dwayne McCrae. After an hour's long manhunt, police say he died from a self-inflicted
[03:02:33.940 --> 03:02:38.580]  gunshot wound at a location off campus. The FBI says McCrae suffered from mental health
[03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:43.180]  issues. Detectives found a three-page note on him listing places in Michigan, Colorado
[03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:49.500]  and New Jersey he also wanted to attack. Soros DA did what they do and reduced the charges
[03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:53.620]  and let this guy walk out so he could buy a gun. So I dug into the prosecutor because
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:56.900]  you know that's what I'm going to do. It's Ingram County prosecutor Carol Seaman who
[03:02:56.900 --> 03:03:03.660]  just retired recently confirmed George Soros back DA. So her official policy was to drop
[03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:08.500]  mandatory prison sentences for felony firearm charges. That's what she did. And this is
[03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:14.620]  what happened. This is the clearest example I've found yet, right? Of woke criminal justice
[03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:24.060]  causing a mass shooting. I will defend myself from violent KKK, black supremacist, Antifa
[03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:29.780]  or anybody else that tries to hurt my family and I will put down as many people as I have
[03:03:29.780 --> 03:03:51.860]  to to protect my family and no more. For two weeks they've had fake news articles everywhere
[03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:57.740]  saying that I'm saying go mow down black people. Sorry, that's the new Black Panther Party
[03:03:57.740 --> 03:04:02.020]  saying that. And that's Chris Cuomo saying he wanted to kill everybody, kill everybody
[03:04:02.020 --> 03:04:07.260]  at CNN, go on a mass shooting rampage, but he decided not to. I was going to kill everybody
[03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:13.260]  including myself. Things can consume you. Italians are so passionate. That's Fredo that's actually
[03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:19.020]  saying that, not me. Everybody that listens knows I want peace. I want justice. And the
[03:04:19.020 --> 03:04:25.380]  number one group in America being killed is black people. But who's killing black people?
[03:04:25.380 --> 03:04:31.740]  Black people. Who's killing white people? Black people statistically. And who's really
[03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:36.540]  killing the black people is Planned Parenthood on the left, where over 70% of black babies
[03:04:36.540 --> 03:04:40.500]  never get out of the womb. And when they do, their families are nonexistent. So they turn
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:44.380]  to a lot of crime, which all statistics show, whether you're black, white or brown, if you
[03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:48.460]  come from a single parent home, you are three to seven times more likely to be imprisoned,
[03:04:48.460 --> 03:04:57.660]  be a violent criminal or on drugs or commit suicide. It's a fact.

[03:06:02.700 --> 03:06:08.180]  What's going on ladies and gentlemen thought criminals info warriors here on band dot video
[03:06:08.180 --> 03:06:14.500]  and the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host here in the fourth hour. My name is drew Hernandez.
[03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:20.820]  I'm host of drew Hernandez live exclusively on rumble and also front lines with drew Hernandez.
[03:06:20.820 --> 03:06:26.620]  You guys can find those great shows in the link in my bio on Twitter, get her truth social
[03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:31.700]  and all that good stuff. Well, we got a lot to talk about today. You guys, it's not looking
[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:37.780]  good. All right, and it's not looking good. Because things are just kind of happening
[03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:44.220]  by coincidence. No such thing as these conspiracy theories any longer. How many of these things
[03:06:44.220 --> 03:06:49.820]  that Alex Jones has come out and said for the past few decades that have come to fruition.
[03:06:49.820 --> 03:06:54.300]  Other truth speakers and seekers that have put the pieces together when it comes to the
[03:06:54.300 --> 03:06:58.980]  new world order, when it comes to the global government of the world, when it comes to
[03:06:58.980 --> 03:07:05.060]  the Klaus Schwab, the Bill Gates, World Health Organization, when it comes to these entities
[03:07:05.060 --> 03:07:11.940]  that want nothing but control and domination and power on a global scale, not just in the
[03:07:11.940 --> 03:07:18.980]  United States, not just in Europe, but across the entire globe. I mean, maybe two, three
[03:07:18.980 --> 03:07:23.580]  decades ago when you would talk like this, you would get demonized, you would get slandered
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:30.100]  as a conspiracy theorist, you would get absolutely just trashed in the mainstream media. They
[03:07:30.100 --> 03:07:34.580]  try to do it even to this day. But what's problematic for the new world order and what's
[03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:40.060]  problematic for the globalists and all these homicidal maniacs that want total world domination
[03:07:40.060 --> 03:07:45.540]  that are out in the open saying this stuff, okay, Klaus Schwab, they talk about mastering
[03:07:45.540 --> 03:07:51.620]  the universe, mastering the technologies of today and tomorrow so they could master the
[03:07:51.620 --> 03:07:57.340]  future. Okay, these people are open about what they want to do. And it's for a very specific
[03:07:57.340 --> 03:08:02.620]  reason. And it's not because it's happening by design. It's not just some kind of coincidence
[03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:07.180]  where everything is falling together, where there's evil in the world and there's bad
[03:08:07.180 --> 03:08:12.220]  people in the world. Yes, there is absolute evil in the world, but people need to quite
[03:08:12.220 --> 03:08:17.980]  literally understand that you're dealing with a strategic agenda that has been in development
[03:08:17.980 --> 03:08:24.220]  that predates Alex Jones that predates any of the trailblazers that have warned of a
[03:08:24.220 --> 03:08:30.500]  new world order that it predates anyone that has been openly vocal about these things.
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:36.180]  You live in in the end times, ladies and gentlemen, these are days of biblical proportions, where
[03:08:36.180 --> 03:08:41.740]  you're watching mass countries move in unison just like the Bible said they would. When
[03:08:41.740 --> 03:08:46.420]  you're watching entities and individuals like Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the world economic
[03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:51.780]  form entities of our current generation right now that are all moving in unison, pushing
[03:08:51.780 --> 03:08:59.460]  us further and further and further and further into the epicenter of what many call the end
[03:08:59.460 --> 03:09:04.020]  of the world. But the Bible clearly calls the end times which the epicenter is the second
[03:09:04.020 --> 03:09:12.180]  coming of Jesus Christ. Now, what comes before that is the end, the advent of the anti Christ,
[03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:18.820]  the false prophet that is alongside of him, that is all energized and empowered by Satan
[03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:24.820]  himself. It is what theologians and Bible scholars have deemed the unholy trinity that
[03:09:24.820 --> 03:09:31.900]  you see during the seven year tribulation just before the second coming of Jesus Christ
[03:09:31.900 --> 03:09:37.500]  and the ultimate showdown in Armageddon, which is not just an event, the Valley of Megiddo
[03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:43.420]  in Israel, Armageddon is an actual place where Christ is going to come back, slaughter many
[03:09:43.420 --> 03:09:48.140]  that are all opposing him, that side with the anti Christ. It's the ultimate showdown
[03:09:48.140 --> 03:09:54.280]  that the Bible has talked about where global governments will unify together for one purpose
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:10:01.340]  and one purpose only. And that's to defy and oppose and make war with God. Bible says
[03:10:01.340 --> 03:10:05.540]  this in Psalms chapter two as well, that the world governments, these governments of the
[03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:10.540]  world, they all unify together and they stick their noses to the sky and they mock God and
[03:10:10.540 --> 03:10:15.880]  they want to fight God. They want to make war with God in a proud, very pompous mentality.
[03:10:15.880 --> 03:10:20.100]  That's what you're seeing unfold right now. The Bible says that God turns around and looks
[03:10:20.100 --> 03:10:26.580]  down upon them and he laughs. Now, the reason why I'm opening up this show today this way
[03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:31.460]  is because I know that all the info warriors out there know exactly what I'm talking about,
[03:10:31.460 --> 03:10:36.740]  I want to encourage you guys. The only way we get this information out is the audience
[03:10:36.740 --> 03:10:41.380]  we have today, the audience we have right now that has been blessed by God to breach
[03:10:41.380 --> 03:10:48.340]  the matrix, get unplugged, be born again and see the truth of the reality that we actually
[03:10:48.340 --> 03:10:54.180]  live in for God's sake. These people want to jack you into a virtual reality, metaverse,
[03:10:54.180 --> 03:10:58.380]  where you have some kind of centralized economy and they have access to your thoughts and
[03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:02.900]  everything that you're thinking so they can manipulate and control every aspect of your
[03:11:02.900 --> 03:11:09.780]  psyche and your life. That is the age that you live in right now. This isn't just technology
[03:11:09.780 --> 03:11:15.780]  that they're speculating might exist in the next 10 years or they're just thinking, I
[03:11:15.780 --> 03:11:19.340]  don't know, what's the world going to be like in 2050 or what's the world going to be like
[03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:24.780]  in 2090? These people are talking about this. They just had the World Government Summit
[03:11:24.780 --> 03:11:29.100]  in Dubai. Like I said when I opened the show, Klaus Schwab is saying we need to master these
[03:11:29.100 --> 03:11:34.780]  technologies now because they know they need to master the future. I talk like this and
[03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:39.940]  I communicate like this because I know people need to understand the only way that we win
[03:11:39.940 --> 03:11:47.140]  and the only way that we truly get an edge up against these people is if we A, understand
[03:11:47.140 --> 03:11:51.020]  that if God be for us who could be against us, we're empowered by God, empowered by the
[03:11:51.020 --> 03:11:57.420]  Holy Spirit. We are the ones that have the ability to take on such evil in our world
[03:11:57.420 --> 03:12:02.140]  on a global scale. If we think we could do this on our own and our own strength, it's
[03:12:02.140 --> 03:12:07.340]  never going to happen. We will get nowhere. We will go nowhere and a lot of people are
[03:12:07.340 --> 03:12:10.820]  truly waking up to that reality. That's the real great awakening. You want to talk about
[03:12:10.820 --> 03:12:15.540]  a great awakening? It's people, yes, waking up to the reality that they're being lied
[03:12:15.540 --> 03:12:21.980]  to, but the ultimate red pill is the Christ Pill. Born again, eyes open, you're open to
[03:12:21.980 --> 03:12:27.780]  the reality that you all live in and we see the world for what it truly is. And right
[03:12:27.780 --> 03:12:33.620]  now we're moving closer and closer and closer to these end times events. We're not in the
[03:12:33.620 --> 03:12:40.020]  Tribulation. The Bible makes it very clear that the Antichrist will be revealed. The
[03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:45.220]  Bible says there will be a third Jewish temple established where the Temple Mount currently
[03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:51.940]  is right now in Jerusalem and that when the Tribulation does come, he will enter that
[03:12:51.940 --> 03:12:57.420]  third temple and he will sit down in the Holy of Holies and he will declare himself to be
[03:12:57.420 --> 03:13:04.940]  God. That has not happened yet, but the Bible is very clear. Christ made it very clear.
[03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:09.780]  God in human flesh, when he's walking the earth in his ministry for the short time that
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:15.900]  he was there in human flesh before he was crucified and rose and ascended back into
[03:13:15.900 --> 03:13:24.820]  heaven, that we would see birth pains, that we would see wars, rumors of wars, pestilences,
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:30.420]  earthquakes, natural disasters. The love of many would grow cold. If that's not happening
[03:13:30.420 --> 03:13:35.660]  right now and you cannot see that or identify that, not just in the United States, ladies
[03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:40.980]  and gentlemen and all my friends watching, but across the entire world, where tyranny
[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:46.100]  is reigning and Christ alluded to that as well when it came to the end times and the signs
[03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:52.780]  of the times that lawlessness would abound, not just defunding the police. It's actual
[03:13:52.780 --> 03:13:59.780]  lawlessness becoming the norm in societies. I'll just take the United States as an example
[03:13:59.780 --> 03:14:04.020]  right now where we live in a current generation right now where they're trying to normalize
[03:14:04.020 --> 03:14:09.580]  the mutualization of the genitals of little kids. If a little boy decides that he's not
[03:14:09.580 --> 03:14:17.740]  a boy at the age of six and he believes he's a girl without parental consent, he should
[03:14:17.740 --> 03:14:22.860]  be able to just chop his genitals up. And the same goes for little girls as well. See,
[03:14:22.860 --> 03:14:29.340]  that is where you are right now. So these things that have been very clear in the Bible
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:37.300]  2,000 years ago, you're seeing in your reality currently right now. Right now. This is the
[03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:41.620]  state of the nation, state of the world, the state of the things that are going on right
[03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:45.700]  now. They're biblical proportions and people need to understand. And this is going to be
[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:51.020]  a hot show right now because I want to challenge people throughout this entire hour. I really
[03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:55.380]  want to grill you. I want to challenge what you believe. I want to challenge what you
[03:14:55.380 --> 03:14:59.100]  know to be true. I want to challenge how far you're willing to go. And I'm not talking
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:05.260]  about violence. I'm not talking about hurting people. I'm talking about being bold, not
[03:15:05.260 --> 03:15:11.140]  being afraid anymore, not being afraid of getting canceled, not being afraid of affiliating
[03:15:11.140 --> 03:15:17.100]  with the wrong people that have been canceled and obliterated into the abyss of total censorship
[03:15:17.100 --> 03:15:23.540]  and being silenced into these digital gulags. I'm talking about being willing to come out
[03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:28.900]  as a truth seeker, truth speaker to boldly just spit in the face of the devil at this
[03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:35.380]  point because we see these traders that claim to be America first that claim to be pro humanity,
[03:15:35.380 --> 03:15:41.020]  but they're not not only by their rhetoric, they lie through their teeth, but their actions
[03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:45.740]  are far from what they're literally saying out their mouths. So we're going to talk about
[03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:50.740]  all of this when we come back from the break. So I need every single one of you guys to
[03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:57.780]  share these links no matter where you're watching, blast them everywhere. We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:02.180]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to
[03:16:02.180 --> 03:16:07.180]  fund an information war and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level
[03:16:07.180 --> 03:16:11.140]  and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this
[03:16:11.140 --> 03:16:16.540]  war against the new world order by visiting infowarstore.com right now and taking action.

[03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:32.540]  coming for the children. But to get to the children, they got to get through us first.
[03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:36.060]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies. They're
[03:16:36.060 --> 03:16:40.300]  already given to pregnant women. Miscarriages are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase
[03:16:40.300 --> 03:16:46.060]  of miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots. We can and will
[03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:50.980]  save the children and they are counting on us. Let's do it together. And the fight starts
[03:16:50.980 --> 03:16:56.180]  at infowarstore.com and the fight continues with your financial support at infowarstore.com.

[03:18:01.100 --> 03:18:06.380]  has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers
[03:18:06.380 --> 03:18:10.580]  supporting us. But when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes
[03:18:10.580 --> 03:18:17.220]  the researchers the writers. They really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at
[03:18:17.220 --> 03:18:22.140]  Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day five six seven
[03:18:22.140 --> 03:18:27.540]  days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself the whole info wars crew I thank
[03:18:27.540 --> 03:18:32.940]  you for your past support. I want to encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay
[03:18:32.940 --> 03:18:37.060]  on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word I know you pray for us that's
[03:18:37.060 --> 03:18:41.620]  wonderful keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store.com
[03:18:41.620 --> 03:18:45.740]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time
[03:18:45.740 --> 03:18:49.820]  keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go by products in
[03:18:49.820 --> 03:18:55.180]  foreshore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to info wars.com our funding
[03:18:55.180 --> 03:18:59.540]  problems will be over. Please take action now. There is a war on for your mind. Your
[03:18:59.540 --> 03:19:06.340]  mind is a battlefield. This is an information war. Info wars popularized those terms more
[03:19:06.340 --> 03:19:12.380]  than two decades ago. And today whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert
[03:19:12.380 --> 03:19:18.260]  Malone they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand
[03:19:18.260 --> 03:19:22.540]  the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them. But we can't do it without funding and
[03:19:22.540 --> 03:19:26.900]  we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system and your

[03:19:35.380 --> 03:19:39.060]  nonviolent but every time you donate money every time you buy products every time you
[03:19:39.060 --> 03:19:43.620]  keep us on air you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new world order in
[03:19:43.620 --> 03:19:48.660]  the nose punching their lies in the nose. We are going to defeat the new world order.
[03:19:48.660 --> 03:19:52.540]  We're going over the top right now is the critical juncture. So please go to info wars
[03:19:52.540 --> 03:19:58.300]  store.com and donate now.
[03:19:58.300 --> 03:20:06.460]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.460 --> 03:20:23.220]  What are the things I'll say that we need to clearly define is who is who. Who is who.
[03:20:23.220 --> 03:20:27.340]  Because when you're talking about information warfare when you're talking about cybernetic
[03:20:27.340 --> 03:20:34.260]  warfare any form of warfare in the Bible is big on this as well. Wolves and sheeps clothing.
[03:20:34.260 --> 03:20:39.620]  The devil disguises himself as an angel of light an individual that appears to be on
[03:20:39.620 --> 03:20:45.420]  your side that appears to be for the cause that appears to be on the right side that
[03:20:45.420 --> 03:20:50.340]  you claim to believe in that they claim to have the same views but you start to go a
[03:20:50.340 --> 03:20:54.620]  little further down that road you start to get a little further down that fight and you
[03:20:54.620 --> 03:20:59.580]  look around you and before you know it the same people that claims to be fighting side
[03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:06.620]  by side with you in this fight turn out to be on the other side turn it around pointing
[03:21:06.620 --> 03:21:13.820]  their guns at you. This is the tale as old as time but this society that we currently
[03:21:13.820 --> 03:21:21.500]  live in right this political correct afraid to hurt people's feelings society is kind
[03:21:21.500 --> 03:21:28.420]  of quite literally how we all got here because if people are afraid to hurt someone's feelings
[03:21:28.420 --> 03:21:33.660]  I don't care if they got a D next to their name or they got an R next to their name
[03:21:33.660 --> 03:21:37.820]  they claim to be a leftist they claim to be a conservative listen I'll tell you something
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:44.900]  right now the truth is going to universally piss everybody off you want to know why because
[03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:53.020]  the truth doesn't consider in any way shape or form how you truly do feel about something
[03:21:53.020 --> 03:21:59.620]  the truth will remain the truth regardless of how you feel any given day and we always
[03:21:59.620 --> 03:22:04.740]  hear this argument where oh let's just be nice to people let's just make sure that we're
[03:22:04.740 --> 03:22:10.220]  sitting there and we're winning the other side and when we're dealing with these groomers
[03:22:10.220 --> 03:22:14.820]  and people that want to mutilate the genitals of children that want to dominate the world
[03:22:14.820 --> 03:22:22.020]  with a new world order that want to take us all into some kind of AI controlled mass grid
[03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:26.820]  system where we're controlled they want mass lockdowns if they could have it this is why
[03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:32.820]  cloud swab says that China is the model if they could have that form of some kind of
[03:22:32.820 --> 03:22:40.700]  zero COVID lockdown across the entire globe these people would take it in an instant you
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:45.220]  see there are people in the movement that claim that they're fighting for freedom there are
[03:22:45.220 --> 03:22:49.780]  people in the movement that claim that they're fighting against tyranny there are people in
[03:22:49.780 --> 03:22:54.740]  the movement that sit there and they say you know what we're against this we're against
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:59.700]  these enemies we're against those that don't love America when in reality a lot of these
[03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:04.780]  people only talk like that because they just simply brand it that way because they're wolves
[03:23:04.780 --> 03:23:09.300]  and sheep's clothing that don't really believe in what they're saying they just brand it
[03:23:09.300 --> 03:23:14.940]  that way so that they can have some kind of audience to monetize it all the info warriors
[03:23:14.940 --> 03:23:20.940]  know exactly what I'm talking about and not only does this happen in so-called right wing
[03:23:20.940 --> 03:23:26.900]  conservative media where you get a bunch of beta male cucks beta female cucks that are
[03:23:26.900 --> 03:23:33.620]  running around complaining that people are are being too main it's like dude like what
[03:23:33.620 --> 03:23:38.060]  what do you expect at this point right it's like you're watching the fall of the nation
[03:23:38.060 --> 03:23:42.980]  you're watching the fall of the United States of America and people are concerned whether
[03:23:42.980 --> 03:23:51.220]  Alex Jones or Drew Hernandez is being too loud and too mean I can't be loud enough you
[03:23:51.220 --> 03:23:56.220]  want to know why because you look at the opposite these people whether they're radical leftists
[03:23:56.220 --> 03:24:00.980]  or their rhino you know New World Order deep state plants in the right whatever it is right
[03:24:00.980 --> 03:24:07.780]  they're agents of Satan these people are about it they will go as far as they possibly can
[03:24:07.780 --> 03:24:13.780]  I'd be willing to say that some of these people believe in what they believe probably more
[03:24:13.780 --> 03:24:20.980]  founded and grounded in their satanic ideologies than they do in some people that find themselves
[03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:25.860]  just thinking they love America thinking they support America but when it comes down to
[03:24:25.860 --> 03:24:31.100]  it when you get these deep state agents and these agents of Satan going after your bank
[03:24:31.100 --> 03:24:37.180]  account going after your livelihood these people pop out of the ground like weeds everybody
[03:24:37.180 --> 03:24:41.660]  flees now I know the info warriors and the thought criminals and everybody watching
[03:24:41.660 --> 03:24:46.300]  I know you guys are about this because if you're watching info wars I mean you've probably
[03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:50.300]  been riding with Alex Jones for a very long time and you know just exactly what I'm talking
[03:24:50.300 --> 03:24:59.300]  about but we do need to continue to push this and we do need to continue to mark those who
[03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:04.300]  don't belong you know the Bible talks about this as well in Romans chapter 16 is that
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:11.260]  when you see those that are causing division and you see those that are not a part of what
[03:25:11.260 --> 03:25:15.860]  the body of Christ is supposed to be doing you identify a wolf in sheep's clothing you
[03:25:15.860 --> 03:25:20.740]  identify someone that is claiming to be something that they're actually not the Bible says to
[03:25:20.740 --> 03:25:27.500]  mark them you watch them and in some cases you put them before the entire church so they
[03:25:27.500 --> 03:25:32.940]  might be humiliated so that everyone else might fear and understand that this is not
[03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:38.100]  going to be tolerated those are in the pastoral epistles in 1st and 2nd Timothy you know pastors
[03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:41.540]  don't talk like that anymore because we have a lot of beta cuck individuals that are afraid
[03:25:41.540 --> 03:25:46.860]  to really just crack down and drop the hammer when it's necessary to do so for the sake
[03:25:46.860 --> 03:25:53.500]  of righteousness truth and preserving what we all know and love this is how you lose
[03:25:53.500 --> 03:25:57.660]  when you get into a position where you're too afraid to speak out you're too afraid to
[03:25:57.660 --> 03:26:04.140]  hurt somebody's feelings God you could be as nice as you possibly want you could be
[03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:09.980]  as nice and has the most articulate argument but you're dealing with people that worship
[03:26:09.980 --> 03:26:14.740]  their father the devil you're dealing with people that are possessed by demons you're
[03:26:14.740 --> 03:26:20.140]  dealing with people that want to destroy you I'm talking about the people that want the
[03:26:20.140 --> 03:26:24.820]  new world order I'm talking about the people that want to mobilize the FBI to go after
[03:26:24.820 --> 03:26:31.100]  parents that are concerned and pissed off that their daughter got raped and loud and
[03:26:31.100 --> 03:26:38.420]  county by a boy that claimed to be a girl in a transgender bathroom that's who I'm
[03:26:38.420 --> 03:26:43.340]  talking about right now and then they turn around and say we love democracy oh some
[03:26:43.340 --> 03:26:47.220]  of them will even come out and say we're America first and we support the first amendment
[03:26:47.220 --> 03:26:53.460]  we support the United States of America I'll give you an example look what's happening
[03:26:53.460 --> 03:26:58.980]  with Ukraine here's an article from Breitbart House Republicans visit Kiev they're a strong
[03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:04.340]  bipartisan support to give Ukraine everything that it needs House Foreign Affairs Committee
[03:27:04.340 --> 03:27:10.580]  chair rep Michael McCall Republican Texas led several Republican lawmakers Tuesday on
[03:27:10.580 --> 03:27:15.140]  a trip to Ukraine where they expressed their support to President Vladimir Zelensky and
[03:27:15.140 --> 03:27:21.300]  conducted oversight of military equipment and they all conclude that Ukraine just needs
[03:27:21.300 --> 03:27:27.620]  everything that it needs while in Ohio President Trump is making a trip there today you have
[03:27:27.620 --> 03:27:32.940]  other conservative influencers and individuals that are showing up to Ohio helping the people
[03:27:32.940 --> 03:27:40.180]  that are being contaminated their water their air supply the acid rain falling from the

[03:27:46.900 --> 03:27:53.660]  Trump country so of course the Biden administration is gonna do nothing to help these people why
[03:27:53.660 --> 03:28:00.700]  because they hate you they hate you and they're willing to allow you to die over their own
[03:28:00.700 --> 03:28:07.860]  political beliefs and ideologies why do you think Pete Buttigieg is doing nothing why
[03:28:07.860 --> 03:28:13.820]  do you think he took so long to make a statement because he's incompetent no stop thinking
[03:28:13.820 --> 03:28:20.100]  these people are incompetent these people know exactly what they're doing so called
[03:28:20.100 --> 03:28:25.980]  puppet president Joe Biden yes is a vegetable and the New World Order needs those vegetable
[03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:33.380]  mindless puppets but he's fully aware of what he's doing by allowing himself to be controlled

[03:28:39.780 --> 03:28:47.260]  to die because of what they believe Ohio is a disaster but there they are Democrats and

[03:32:19.160 --> 03:32:20.000]  It's away.
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:22.760]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack
[03:32:22.760 --> 03:32:23.960]  by the establishment than ever.

[03:32:58.120 --> 03:33:00.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[03:33:00.920 --> 03:33:04.520]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:04.520 --> 03:33:16.040]  You know, I'm an individual that is always about bringing
[03:33:16.040 --> 03:33:19.280]  the receipts, because if we're talking about truth,
[03:33:19.280 --> 03:33:22.240]  we're talking about error and lies,
[03:33:22.240 --> 03:33:26.480]  making some pretty harsh accusations,
[03:33:26.480 --> 03:33:29.240]  being spot on right over the target.
[03:33:29.240 --> 03:33:32.080]  You know, people wonder why individuals like myself
[03:33:32.080 --> 03:33:35.640]  can't have a home on YouTube, get de-boosted
[03:33:35.640 --> 03:33:41.480]  and throttled out of oblivion, why Alex Jones gets censored
[03:33:41.480 --> 03:33:44.440]  across the entire globe.
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:45.640]  And people wonder why.
[03:33:45.640 --> 03:33:49.920]  Why do these individuals, why do these individuals end up
[03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:53.960]  in these positions where they're not allowed to have a voice?
[03:33:53.960 --> 03:33:55.280]  Is it because they're mean?
[03:33:55.280 --> 03:33:58.120]  And then you see, you know, the New World Order proxies
[03:33:58.120 --> 03:34:01.520]  in the media, and in Hollywood, they send these little creatures
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:04.160]  out there, the Brian Stelters, and these losers
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:06.280]  that just run around and say, Alex, Alex Jones
[03:34:06.280 --> 03:34:09.000]  is a conspiracy theorist, and Joe Hernandez is as well.
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:12.440]  How dare, how dare they show the New World Order being
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:14.800]  talked about at Davos?
[03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:15.760]  Right?
[03:34:15.760 --> 03:34:17.200]  Why do they do that?
[03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:18.160]  Why do they do that?
[03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:22.840]  They do that because it's 100% real, OK?
[03:34:22.840 --> 03:34:25.880]  They do that, and they slander because these people
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:28.080]  understand that it's all real.
[03:34:28.080 --> 03:34:32.680]  They understand, and they believe, and they know that God
[03:34:32.680 --> 03:34:36.840]  is real, and that the devil is 100%
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:40.200]  fully functional and real because they serve him.
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:42.920]  That's why you see the Luciferianism and the open
[03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:48.520]  occult rituals at the Grammys with Sam Smith running
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:52.680]  around, praising the devil, and Hollywood just sitting there
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:54.440]  throwing up their arms in the air.
[03:34:54.440 --> 03:34:55.920]  Like, it's some amazing thing.
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:58.920]  Yes, oh, it's the Church of Satan out in the open,
[03:34:58.920 --> 03:35:02.080]  and everyone just loves it and praises it.
[03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:07.800]  Totally degenerate, totally disgusting, 100% satanic.
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:13.000]  There it is, throwing all of the signs and symbols up.
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:16.200]  They look like little exorcist characters,
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:19.840]  forming some kind of pentagram center stage at the Grammys.
[03:35:19.840 --> 03:35:23.920]  Why are you beginning to see this?
[03:35:23.920 --> 03:35:26.680]  The difference now than the past,
[03:35:26.680 --> 03:35:28.960]  because if you grew up in the 80s, you grew up in the past,
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:32.800]  you've seen satanic symbolism, rock bands using pentagrams,
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:36.120]  throwing up the 666 everywhere.
[03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:39.840]  What's fast-forwarded now is the technology of the day.
[03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:42.640]  The things that have changed now is the technology
[03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:45.360]  where we currently are at today.
[03:35:45.360 --> 03:35:48.280]  Bible scholars used to ask themselves all the time,
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:51.840]  how in the world will the Antichrist
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:55.840]  establish a one-world government?
[03:35:55.840 --> 03:35:59.080]  Because they take a look at passages in the Bible that say,
[03:35:59.080 --> 03:36:02.880]  his mark will be in the forehead, and there are the forearm,
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:07.680]  and his number will be 666, the mark of the beast.
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:11.360]  Bible scholars would ask themselves, in times past,
[03:36:11.360 --> 03:36:12.720]  how could that ever happen?
[03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:17.040]  They couldn't comprehend what kind of technology
[03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:20.320]  that would be used in order to implement a system
[03:36:20.320 --> 03:36:25.720]  that would get the whole world in unison and on board,
[03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:32.120]  and that they might be able to or will be able to surveil it
[03:36:32.120 --> 03:36:34.000]  and control and regulate it.
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:37.320]  Because it's one thing for the king to put out a decree.
[03:36:37.320 --> 03:36:39.160]  People can hide from that.
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:41.280]  People can get around that.
[03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:44.000]  But the technology that has changed right now
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.200]  with all the Satanism that you're seeing,
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:48.960]  the occult worship out in the open,
[03:36:48.960 --> 03:36:52.920]  people open about their Luciferianism,
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:55.840]  the technology is catching up with what the Bible said
[03:36:55.840 --> 03:36:57.920]  would take place in the end times.
[03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:00.000]  I mean, look what happened in 2020.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:03.080]  Majority of the world was willing to bend the knee.
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:06.480]  Global lockdowns, 2021 came around.
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:10.040]  There were rumors in 2020 about a vaccine passport.
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:12.200]  You would be locked out of the economy.
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:15.680]  If you were a medical health care worker, you lost your job.
[03:37:15.680 --> 03:37:18.400]  If you worked in the federal government, you lost your job.
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:20.640]  This is still taking place today.
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:22.240]  We saw this in Australia.
[03:37:22.240 --> 03:37:24.200]  We saw this in New Zealand.
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:26.400]  We saw the entire world.
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:28.600]  Not you guys out there in the Info Warriors that said,
[03:37:28.600 --> 03:37:31.080]  yeah, you know what, no, I want my freedom.
[03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:32.720]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[03:37:32.720 --> 03:37:34.800]  I'm not talking about you guys.
[03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:39.040]  We did see millions of people freaking out,
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:41.280]  willing to sacrifice their freedoms
[03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:43.880]  and their liberties for what?
[03:37:43.880 --> 03:37:48.880]  Safety, security, stay home, save lives.
[03:37:49.200 --> 03:37:52.360]  Yes, the virtue signal is we're gonna stay home
[03:37:52.360 --> 03:37:54.960]  and I am going to save lives because I'm so great
[03:37:54.960 --> 03:37:58.240]  because the great high priest, Dr. Fauci, told me so.
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:02.280]  We saw the mask formation form across the entire world.
[03:38:02.280 --> 03:38:04.320]  There they are right now.
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:06.880]  The literal cult exists to this day
[03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:10.080]  where people were willing to obey Big Brother,
[03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:15.080]  lock down in their homes, never go outside ever again.
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:20.320]  They bent the knee to vaccine passports
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:22.000]  to get locked out of the economy.
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:24.880]  And this was on a worldwide scale.
[03:38:24.880 --> 03:38:25.840]  Drew, what are you talking about?
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:29.560]  What I'm talking about is that the world is ready and primed
[03:38:30.960 --> 03:38:35.120]  to see what the Bible said is going to come in the end times.
[03:38:35.120 --> 03:38:37.120]  For a centralized world leader
[03:38:37.120 --> 03:38:39.480]  that will be a superstar on planet Earth
[03:38:39.480 --> 03:38:40.440]  according to the Bible,
[03:38:40.440 --> 03:38:44.240]  this guy is gonna be just a rock star on planet Earth.
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:47.280]  Gonna bring unity in a way
[03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:48.880]  that the world has never seen before,
[03:38:48.880 --> 03:38:51.120]  a very attractive individual
[03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:52.440]  that people are gonna be drawn to.
[03:38:52.440 --> 03:38:54.480]  The Bible says that he is an orator.
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:57.840]  He speaks great things that attract people to him.
[03:38:59.080 --> 03:39:02.320]  But at the same time, he's filled with lawlessness,
[03:39:02.320 --> 03:39:04.800]  evil, and satanically charged.
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:07.920]  The world is ready because through fear,
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:09.520]  they will bow down.
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:13.160]  So if we end up in a situation where the whole world,
[03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:16.640]  it's kinda quite literally the opposite of what God says.
[03:39:18.360 --> 03:39:21.520]  God says that he himself will be our provider,
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:25.800]  our all in all, that we should fear God above all else.
[03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:27.760]  When it comes to satan, the antichrist,
[03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:29.920]  and all of these figures that we see in the Bible
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:32.520]  that are real, they're literally the opposite.
[03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:34.440]  That is what antichrist is.
[03:39:34.440 --> 03:39:36.160]  It's not just someone that's in opposition,
[03:39:36.160 --> 03:39:38.320]  someone in the place of a pseudo Christ.
[03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:40.840]  They claim to be a savior,
[03:39:40.840 --> 03:39:42.080]  but they function through fear.
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:45.240]  It's the opposite of love and comfort.
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:47.640]  And these people will pressure people through fear
[03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:49.600]  in order to sacrifice their freedoms,
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:51.320]  sacrifice their liberties,
[03:39:51.320 --> 03:39:53.960]  so they are given total control.
[03:39:53.960 --> 03:39:57.000]  They get the keys handed straight over to them,
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.800]  and don't even have to fire a shot.
[03:40:00.240 --> 03:40:02.240]  You see, this is all satanically inspired,
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:04.560]  and what we're watching on a grand scale right now
[03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:06.480]  is we're watching all these things continue
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:08.320]  to develop on a day to day basis.
[03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:11.720]  So I encourage people every single day,
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:13.400]  we're on the verge of World War III,
[03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:16.960]  you got a puppet president, Joe Biden in Ukraine
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:18.880]  trying to talk tough in Poland,
[03:40:20.040 --> 03:40:21.840]  saying that he's ready,
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:24.880]  and that the United States support for Ukraine
[03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:27.480]  when it comes to war is never gonna waver.
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:30.680]  You got puppet president Biden talking tough
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:32.920]  on the world stage saying, back in our home,
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:35.000]  I just see nothing but Ukrainian flags
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.480]  all over the place in America.
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:38.960]  I mean, he's not lying.
[03:40:38.960 --> 03:40:41.760]  You have all these woke hard losers running around
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:43.880]  just waiting for the next thing to support.
[03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:45.440]  Give me the next update.
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:46.960]  The NPC is running around.
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:48.480]  Tell me what to believe, daddy.
[03:40:48.480 --> 03:40:49.840]  Jab me more, daddy.
[03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:52.960]  Oh yes, impose your tyranny on me more, daddy.
[03:40:52.960 --> 03:40:55.080]  I want more, I want more.
[03:40:55.080 --> 03:40:56.680]  Just give it to me, daddy.
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:40:59.920]  It's like, come on, dude.
[03:40:59.920 --> 03:41:02.000]  Let's take a look around you.
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:03.720]  I mean, even this video right here
[03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:05.280]  that went viral the other day,
[03:41:05.280 --> 03:41:07.160]  Joe Biden running around trying to talk tough.
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:11.080]  You got people cheering, yes, World War III, yes.
[03:41:11.080 --> 03:41:13.360]  I don't even know why I'm supporting Ukraine,
[03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:16.440]  but let's just end up in another never-ending war.
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:19.080]  Yeah, more people die.
[03:41:19.080 --> 03:41:22.080]  Yeah, death, destruction.
[03:41:22.080 --> 03:41:24.840]  Woo, let's all die.
[03:41:24.840 --> 03:41:26.480]  This is advanced, man.
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:30.600]  You wanna talk about an information war, a PSYOP, right?
[03:41:30.600 --> 03:41:34.840]  Get people all on board cheering their own destruction
[03:41:34.840 --> 03:41:38.480]  and demise over lies, okay?
[03:41:38.480 --> 03:41:40.040]  Over lies.
[03:41:41.840 --> 03:41:44.200]  President Vladimir Zelensky is,
[03:41:44.200 --> 03:41:45.840]  I'm just gonna say it, man.
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:50.600]  President Vladimir Zelensky is quite literally probably,
[03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:56.200]  probably the most effective successful grifter of all time,
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:41:58.520]  bro, of all time.
[03:41:58.520 --> 03:42:01.760]  This guy has raised tens of billions of dollars
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:05.760]  off of the US alone, off of the US alone.
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:08.360]  While our infrastructure has fallen apart,
[03:42:08.360 --> 03:42:12.240]  while the CCP is invading our skies uninvited,
[03:42:13.720 --> 03:42:16.560]  while you're watching Los Angeles fall to pieces,
[03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:19.840]  the fentanyl is flooding the United States,
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:21.680]  the economy is plunging,
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:23.960]  we're on the verge of a great depression.
[03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:27.760]  But no, I'm supposed to support Zelensky.
[03:42:27.760 --> 03:42:30.120]  I'm supposed to care about Ukraine.
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:32.960]  This is beyond America last, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:33.960 --> 03:42:36.560]  This is let's just destroy humanity.
[03:42:36.560 --> 03:42:38.560]  Let's just destroy humans.
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:40.240]  They don't care if you're an American.
[03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:41.560]  They don't care what you are.
[03:42:41.560 --> 03:42:44.240]  All they care about is that you're willing to obey,
[03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:47.560]  and if you don't, it's death, death, death,
[03:42:47.560 --> 03:42:50.200]  death and destruction, and they cheer it.
[03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:51.400]  Because that's what they want.
[03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:54.160]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:21.400 --> 03:43:23.720]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:23.720 --> 03:43:25.440]  To get a signed or unsigned copy
[03:43:25.440 --> 03:43:27.440]  of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World,
[03:43:27.440 --> 03:43:29.320]  ultimate bone broth, back at stock,
[03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:33.200]  Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have,
[03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:35.120]  that's the highest quality you're gonna find anywhere
[03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:37.040]  at more than half off.
[03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:39.800]  It's all available at infowarsstore.com,
[03:43:39.800 --> 03:43:41.160]  some of the very best products.
[03:43:41.160 --> 03:43:43.280]  And a lot of you have never shopped at Infowarsstore.
[03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:44.400]  You've been watching for years,
[03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:45.600]  you've been listening for years,
[03:43:45.600 --> 03:43:48.600]  but you've never taken the step to go to Infowarsstore.
[03:43:48.600 --> 03:43:51.480]  These are great products that really work and are amazing,
[03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:52.840]  plus they keep us on air.
[03:43:52.840 --> 03:43:54.360]  So again, please take action,
[03:43:54.360 --> 03:43:57.600]  go to infowarsstore.com today, and I thank you.
[03:43:57.600 --> 03:43:59.440]  Infowars is winning.
[03:43:59.440 --> 03:44:01.520]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:02.800]  We were supposed to be off the air
[03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:04.280]  months and months and months ago.
[03:44:04.280 --> 03:44:07.040]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:09.160]  They told you we were gonna be shut down.
[03:44:09.160 --> 03:44:11.160]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[03:44:11.160 --> 03:44:12.160]  None of that's true.
[03:44:12.160 --> 03:44:13.560]  It's all being appealed.
[03:44:13.560 --> 03:44:15.680]  They want you to think Infowars is dead,
[03:44:15.680 --> 03:44:18.480]  but if you simply stand up and support Infowars,
[03:44:18.480 --> 03:44:20.600]  we've got years and years of appeals,
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:22.520]  and we will not be taken off the air.
[03:44:22.520 --> 03:44:24.920]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down,
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:25.960]  they're gonna win.
[03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:28.680]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:31.200]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get incredible products,
[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:33.120]  supplements, books, films, t-shirts,
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:34.800]  you name it, that fund the Infowar,
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:37.200]  and empower your life, and let the globalists know
[03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:39.000]  their sigh up has not worked.
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:40.360]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[03:44:40.360 --> 03:44:44.840]  Take action at infowarstore.com today,
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:46.680]  because the only people that can take us off the air
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:48.880]  is you, the viewers, and listeners.
[03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:50.960]  The majority of you have not been silent.
[03:44:50.960 --> 03:44:52.200]  Well, some of you have.
[03:44:52.200 --> 03:44:54.240]  Do not let the globalists brainwash you.
[03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:56.640]  Go to infowarsstore.com and keep us on the air.
[03:44:59.520 --> 03:45:04.160]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023,
[03:45:04.160 --> 03:45:05.960]  and the world is an insane place.
[03:45:05.960 --> 03:45:07.680]  World War III has already started.
[03:45:07.680 --> 03:45:10.040]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:45:10.040 --> 03:45:11.160]  There's mass censorship.
[03:45:11.160 --> 03:45:13.400]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[03:45:13.400 --> 03:45:15.680]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening,
[03:45:15.680 --> 03:45:17.880]  but the good things that are happening is humanity
[03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:20.360]  is really accelerating its way.
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:23.120]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack
[03:45:23.120 --> 03:45:24.280]  by the establishment than ever.
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:26.760]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word
[03:45:26.760 --> 03:45:28.920]  about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:30.520]  and to keep the broadcast on the air
[03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:32.680]  by getting great products at infowarsore.com.
[03:45:32.680 --> 03:45:34.280]  And whether it's a final signed copy,
[03:45:34.280 --> 03:45:35.360]  they're almost all sold out,
[03:45:35.360 --> 03:45:36.760]  by the great reset in the world,
[03:45:36.760 --> 03:45:38.560]  or open bone broths, finally back in stock

[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:43.040]  These are truly amazing products.

[03:45:46.160 --> 03:45:49.240]  and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:51.880]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air,
[03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:54.120]  so please take action now at infowarsore.
[03:45:54.120 --> 03:45:59.600]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com,
[03:45:59.600 --> 03:46:02.040]  connect with trusted and unbiased doctors
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:03.280]  at the wellness company.
[03:46:03.280 --> 03:46:05.520]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be
[03:46:05.520 --> 03:46:07.200]  the chief scientific officer of the company.
[03:46:07.200 --> 03:46:09.920]  I contribute with like so many else do there,
[03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:11.680]  so many wonderful doctors.
[03:46:11.680 --> 03:46:13.960]  Far and away, the most popular product
[03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:17.440]  is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement
[03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:19.160]  that features natokinase.
[03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:21.480]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:46:21.480 --> 03:46:25.240]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now
[03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:27.200]  that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:46:27.200 --> 03:46:28.040]  This is very important.
[03:46:28.040 --> 03:46:29.960]  The spike protein is loaded in the body
[03:46:29.960 --> 03:46:31.440]  with the COVID-19 infection,
[03:46:31.440 --> 03:46:33.000]  and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:34.560]  People are lower with the spike protein,
[03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:35.480]  they don't feel well.
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:37.200]  This is a potential solution.
[03:46:37.200 --> 03:46:40.240]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:46:40.240 --> 03:46:43.120]  So does ivermectin, and now natokinase.
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:44.480]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:46:44.480 --> 03:46:46.240]  Natural substances, in a sense,
[03:46:46.240 --> 03:46:48.760]  combating this man-made disaster,
[03:46:48.760 --> 03:46:50.600]  SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:53.120]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support,
[03:46:53.120 --> 03:46:54.480]  and thank you for getting into that,
[03:46:54.480 --> 03:46:55.320]  because it's important.
[03:46:55.320 --> 03:46:58.040]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:46:58.040 --> 03:47:00.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:04.400]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:04.400 --> 03:47:07.800]  All right, guys, I got to confess, you know,
[03:47:07.800 --> 03:47:12.040]  sometimes I got the attention span of a squirrel in my mind,
[03:47:12.040 --> 03:47:16.560]  and as a host, I don't know, sometimes, you know,
[03:47:16.560 --> 03:47:19.480]  that I guess it works, I guess it could be entertaining,
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:21.720]  but sometimes, I don't know if it kind of works against,
[03:47:21.720 --> 03:47:24.680]  you know, sometimes when I'm trying to get my thoughts out there.
[03:47:24.680 --> 03:47:27.160]  So I was talking about receipt,
[03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:29.280]  but I don't know if it kind of works against it,
[03:47:29.280 --> 03:47:31.120]  but I don't know if it works against it.
[03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:34.680]  So I was talking about receipts,
[03:47:34.680 --> 03:47:38.280]  that we ended up somehow talking about how, you know,
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:41.520]  they want World War III, and they all want to kill us.
[03:47:41.520 --> 03:47:43.360]  So I wanted to show you guys these receipts.
[03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:46.520]  I'm actually a host of two shows.
[03:47:46.520 --> 03:47:47.720]  One is Drew Hernandez Live,
[03:47:47.720 --> 03:47:49.600]  that you guys can find exclusively on Rumble,
[03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:52.480]  and I also host a show called Frontlines,
[03:47:52.480 --> 03:47:55.040]  with Drew Hernandez on Real America's Voice,
[03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:58.720]  and with that show, we have various different reporters
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:01.440]  that go out and report on my behalf
[03:48:01.440 --> 03:48:03.760]  in different, you know, regions of the world,
[03:48:03.760 --> 03:48:07.720]  the United States, especially when things are going down.
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:11.840]  So we sent a team to East Palestine last night.
[03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:13.080]  They're out there right now,
[03:48:13.080 --> 03:48:14.840]  and so I wanted to show you guys,
[03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:16.680]  look at this video of one of our reporters,
[03:48:16.680 --> 03:48:18.000]  her name is Rebecca Brennan,
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:20.920]  you guys should go follow her on Twitter as well.
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:23.480]  East Palestine residents, like this woman,
[03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:26.320]  are frustrated with the lack of federal government response,
[03:48:26.320 --> 03:48:30.440]  and do not trust the EPA is being thorough or transparent.
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:31.840]  The woman in the video says,
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:33.880]  they don't care about us, bottom line,
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:35.320]  take a look at this.
[03:48:35.320 --> 03:48:38.880]  Dioxide, the smallest particle,
[03:48:38.880 --> 03:48:41.280]  will cause people not be able to carry a baby
[03:48:41.280 --> 03:48:43.080]  for three generations.
[03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:45.440]  People who are pregnant are going to abort,
[03:48:45.440 --> 03:48:48.440]  they're going to get cancer, heart cancer, liver cancer.
[03:48:48.440 --> 03:48:51.080]  I think they did not check for the dioxin,
[03:48:51.080 --> 03:48:54.240]  whatever they're checking for and saying it's safe levels,
[03:48:54.240 --> 03:48:56.440]  it's either an outright lie,
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:48:58.400]  or they aren't checking for the right things,
[03:48:58.400 --> 03:49:02.720]  and dioxin is the big news that nobody's talking about.
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:03.840]  Please check it out.
[03:49:03.840 --> 03:49:05.200]  I think it sends a very clear message
[03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:08.200]  to the American people, they don't care about us.
[03:49:09.680 --> 03:49:11.360]  Bottom line.
[03:49:11.360 --> 03:49:15.120]  Bottom line, that's what I'm talking about, right?
[03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:19.560]  The bottom line is that in unison, right?
[03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:22.640]  Because I think people that aren't really politically engaged,
[03:49:22.640 --> 03:49:26.800]  they sit back and they say, wow, what a terrible thing.
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:30.200]  That's going on in Ohio, their water is contaminated,
[03:49:30.200 --> 03:49:34.240]  their air is contaminated, they got animals dying,
[03:49:34.240 --> 03:49:37.960]  fish, chickens, you name it, the people are suffering.
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:41.320]  What is Biden doing in Ukraine, right?
[03:49:42.240 --> 03:49:44.920]  I think people are watching that and they're saying,
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:48.920]  that's crazy, but they don't think that deeply into it,
[03:49:48.920 --> 03:49:51.520]  and it's not just that these people are incompetent,
[03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:54.480]  no, they do this on purpose, okay?
[03:49:54.480 --> 03:49:59.320]  These are the same people that call you mega Republicans,
[03:49:59.320 --> 03:50:01.800]  these are the same people that call you
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:04.600]  radical right-wing extremists,
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:09.280]  these are the same people that call you a domestic terrorist,
[03:50:09.280 --> 03:50:11.640]  because you're a law-abiding gun owner,
[03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:13.680]  and you love the Second Amendment,
[03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:15.880]  and you like to wave a don't-tread-me flag
[03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:18.400]  every now and then, or have one in front of your house,
[03:50:18.400 --> 03:50:22.960]  these are the same people that view you that way.
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:27.200]  So when you see this current federal government,
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:31.360]  allow Ohio, particularly in Trump country,
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:34.240]  suffer and get no help,
[03:50:34.240 --> 03:50:36.920]  and it takes Trump to go down there
[03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:39.080]  for these people to finally do something,
[03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:42.680]  oh, because they care about political optics.
[03:50:42.680 --> 03:50:44.080]  Drew, that's a little too far-fetched,
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:47.680]  are these people really, are they really that crazy?
[03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:49.840]  Are they really that willing
[03:50:49.840 --> 03:50:52.320]  to allow their political opponents to suffer
[03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:54.240]  on such a grand scale like that
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:50:55.600]  as some kind of punishment?
[03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:00.600]  Yes, yes, look what they did with January 6th.
[03:51:01.680 --> 03:51:05.040]  Look at the J6 prisoners right now to this day
[03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:08.120]  that are suffering, that are suffering
[03:51:08.120 --> 03:51:11.840]  because they view them as political opponents.
[03:51:11.840 --> 03:51:15.160]  So yes, are these people willing to allow you to suffer
[03:51:15.160 --> 03:51:18.320]  and die because they have a political difference
[03:51:18.320 --> 03:51:20.040]  than you do?
[03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:22.280]  It's not just a political difference.
[03:51:22.280 --> 03:51:26.240]  These people view you as terrorists.
[03:51:26.240 --> 03:51:28.160]  You know there's a reason for that, right?
[03:51:29.320 --> 03:51:31.160]  What does a terrorist have?
[03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:34.600]  What does a terrorist really have?
[03:51:35.600 --> 03:51:37.400]  Do terrorists have rights?
[03:51:39.640 --> 03:51:43.520]  Are terrorists viewed as people that are safe?
[03:51:43.520 --> 03:51:46.880]  Are terrorists viewed as human beings?
[03:51:46.880 --> 03:51:49.800]  Are they viewed as threats?
[03:51:49.800 --> 03:51:53.000]  You don't view a terrorist as a human being with rights.
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:56.040]  You view a terrorist as someone that is a threat
[03:51:56.040 --> 03:51:58.320]  to the general public that is a threat
[03:51:58.320 --> 03:52:03.320]  that needs to be taken out and eradicated, okay?
[03:52:03.320 --> 03:52:06.200]  That is why these people use these kind of radical terms
[03:52:06.200 --> 03:52:09.160]  because they view you as someone that doesn't have rights.
[03:52:09.160 --> 03:52:11.360]  They view you as someone that's a threat.
[03:52:11.360 --> 03:52:14.280]  They view you as someone that needs to be taken out
[03:52:14.280 --> 03:52:15.840]  immediately.
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:17.880]  So it makes perfect sense to me
[03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:20.160]  that the people in Ohio are suffering
[03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:23.160]  and the current federal government is doing nothing,
[03:52:23.160 --> 03:52:26.120]  supporting them, not at all.
[03:52:26.120 --> 03:52:26.960]  Why?
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:28.840]  Why?
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:29.680]  Because they're incompetent?
[03:52:29.680 --> 03:52:32.880]  No, because they hate you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:34.440]  These people hate you.
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:39.400]  Well, here's this viral video of Pete Buttigieg
[03:52:39.400 --> 03:52:42.800]  that was confronted about the crisis in Ohio.
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:44.480]  And just look at the answer.
[03:52:44.480 --> 03:52:46.520]  The answer speaks for itself.
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:47.880]  Take a look.
[03:52:47.880 --> 03:52:49.480]  Secretary, what do you have to say?
[03:52:49.480 --> 03:52:50.520]  Hi, how are you?
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:52.800]  Jenny Tarr at the Daily Calling News Foundation.
[03:52:52.800 --> 03:52:54.800]  What do you have to say to the folks
[03:52:54.800 --> 03:52:59.080]  in Ohio East Palestine who are suffering right now?
[03:52:59.080 --> 03:53:00.960]  Well, I'd refer you to about a dozen interviews
[03:53:00.960 --> 03:53:01.800]  I've given today.
[03:53:01.800 --> 03:53:05.120]  And if you'd like to arrange a conversation,
[03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:07.320]  make sure you reach out to a press office
[03:53:07.320 --> 03:53:09.600]  about that conversation with you.
[03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:11.000]  You don't have a message for them?
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:13.040]  I do, and I shared it with the press many times today.
[03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:14.800]  I'd refer you to those comments.
[03:53:14.800 --> 03:53:16.040]  Are you not sharing it with us?
[03:53:16.040 --> 03:53:17.360]  No, I'm going to refer you to the comments
[03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:19.440]  that I made to the press because right now
[03:53:19.440 --> 03:53:21.680]  I'm taking some personal time and I'm walking down the street.
[03:53:21.680 --> 03:53:22.960]  Are you going down there?
[03:53:22.960 --> 03:53:23.800]  What's that?
[03:53:23.800 --> 03:53:24.840]  Are you going down there at all?
[03:53:24.840 --> 03:53:27.480]  Um, yep, I am.
[03:53:27.480 --> 03:53:29.040]  When are you going?
[03:53:29.040 --> 03:53:31.200]  I'll share that when I'm ready.
[03:53:31.200 --> 03:53:32.040]  Okay, thank you.
[03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:33.360]  I'm not talking down the street.
[03:53:33.360 --> 03:53:34.200]  Can I get a photo of you?
[03:53:34.200 --> 03:53:35.040]  Yeah.
[03:53:35.040 --> 03:53:38.960]  This is all hate.
[03:53:38.960 --> 03:53:42.760]  This is all not willing to communicate,
[03:53:42.760 --> 03:53:44.840]  not willing to give an answer,
[03:53:44.840 --> 03:53:47.400]  not willing to talk to the press,
[03:53:47.400 --> 03:53:50.440]  not willing to give an answer, okay,
[03:53:50.440 --> 03:53:53.200]  to the community of not just Ohio,
[03:53:53.200 --> 03:53:55.480]  but to the United States of America
[03:53:55.480 --> 03:53:58.000]  because they feel superior to you.
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:01.040]  They believe that they don't have to give an answer
[03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:01.880]  to the media.
[03:54:01.880 --> 03:54:04.240]  They feel like they're above the people
[03:54:04.240 --> 03:54:06.080]  of the United States of America
[03:54:06.080 --> 03:54:08.760]  and they believe that they're just going to let you suffer
[03:54:08.760 --> 03:54:10.880]  and my comments were enough.
[03:54:10.880 --> 03:54:15.120]  Oh, my comments that I made to the public are enough.
[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:16.520]  I'm Pete Buttigieg.
[03:54:16.520 --> 03:54:17.880]  Can you leave me alone?
[03:54:17.880 --> 03:54:18.880]  Can you leave me alone
[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:20.800]  while I'm out walking with my husband?
[03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:24.440]  I'm making some, I'm on some personal time.
[03:54:24.440 --> 03:54:26.760]  I don't want to talk about this right now.
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:32.920]  It's just like, that's the reality of the situation.
[03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:34.520]  The reality of the situation
[03:54:34.520 --> 03:54:36.720]  is that these people hate you
[03:54:36.720 --> 03:54:38.560]  and he's like, oh, I'm taking some personal time.
[03:54:38.560 --> 03:54:40.400]  I don't have time to talk to you right now.
[03:54:40.400 --> 03:54:42.040]  I know the people are suffering,
[03:54:42.040 --> 03:54:45.880]  but just don't look at my comments that I made on Twitter.
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:47.120]  What did he say?
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:47.960]  What did he say?
[03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:48.800]  It took him days.
[03:54:48.800 --> 03:54:51.080]  It took him like 10 days to make a comment,
[03:54:51.080 --> 03:54:53.240]  to communicate to the people of Ohio.
[03:54:53.240 --> 03:54:54.280]  What did he say?
[03:54:54.280 --> 03:54:56.520]  I think one of our, I'm paraphrasing,
[03:54:56.520 --> 03:54:58.280]  one of our main concerns right now,
[03:54:58.280 --> 03:54:59.480]  one of our main concerns right now
[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:02.080]  is that the people of Ohio have access
[03:55:02.080 --> 03:55:04.520]  to accurate, accurate information.
[03:55:07.720 --> 03:55:09.400]  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:55:09.400 --> 03:55:10.240]  You know what?
[03:55:10.240 --> 03:55:11.080]  You know what?
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:11.920]  You know what, guys?
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:12.760]  You know what?
[03:55:12.760 --> 03:55:13.600]  No, no, no, you know what?
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:14.440]  You know what?
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:15.360]  Alex Jones is too mean.
[03:55:15.360 --> 03:55:17.440]  Drew Hernandez is too mean.
[03:55:17.440 --> 03:55:19.920]  You know, Matt Walsh is too mean.
[03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:21.640]  These individuals that come out
[03:55:21.640 --> 03:55:23.640]  and they're aggressive with their messages
[03:55:23.640 --> 03:55:26.600]  because we see, we see the devil.
[03:55:26.600 --> 03:55:28.640]  We see, our eyes are open.
[03:55:28.640 --> 03:55:30.120]  We see who we're dealing with.
[03:55:30.120 --> 03:55:33.040]  We know who our enemies are on both sides
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:35.160]  and we're not tolerating it anymore.
[03:55:35.160 --> 03:55:37.200]  And we know that these people are willing
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:39.280]  to throw you all into gulags
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:41.880]  and designate you all domestic terrorists.
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:44.840]  Oh, but I'm the bad guy, but I'm too mean.
[03:55:44.840 --> 03:55:47.000]  Oh, you're not communicating effectively.
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:48.480]  You're not gonna win them over.
[03:55:48.480 --> 03:55:50.720]  I don't wanna win over these pedophiles, dude.
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:53.240]  Screw all these tyrants.
[03:55:53.240 --> 03:55:55.360]  Let them get dealt with by God.
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:55:56.560]  Give them the gospel.
[03:55:56.560 --> 03:55:59.120]  They could repent, but at the same time,
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:00.600]  we're gonna oppose evil.
[03:56:00.600 --> 03:56:02.280]  We're gonna oppose tyranny.
[03:56:02.280 --> 03:56:03.920]  We're not gonna tolerate this
[03:56:03.920 --> 03:56:06.720]  and try and be, oh, the nice conservatives,
[03:56:06.720 --> 03:56:08.320]  the goody-two-shoe, beta males,
[03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:09.640]  and all these beta Christians
[03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:12.480]  that don't wanna hurt anybody's feelings.
[03:56:12.480 --> 03:56:15.760]  When you have these tyrants that are willing to enslave you
[03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:18.640]  and enslave humanity and your children
[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:22.440]  and manipulate their minds and warp their minds,
[03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:27.440]  while people die in Ohio, we can't be loud enough.
[03:56:27.440 --> 03:56:29.560]  I can't have a microphone.
[03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:32.320]  I can't have a megaphone that's loud enough
[03:56:32.320 --> 03:56:34.000]  to speak to the entire world.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:37.360]  There's a reason why they censor, and it's for this reason.
[03:56:38.280 --> 03:56:40.240]  Because when you unmask the devil,
[03:56:40.240 --> 03:56:42.440]  and you're speaking the truth at the same time,
[03:56:42.440 --> 03:56:44.760]  you're gonna get hit on all fronts.
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:48.080]  I'm so sick of these people, aren't you guys?
[03:56:48.080 --> 03:56:51.440]  Aren't you guys sick of these beta-cuck losers
[03:56:51.440 --> 03:56:52.640]  that run around and say,
[03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:55.280]  oh, you should just be nicer with your delivery.
[03:56:55.280 --> 03:56:58.080]  Oh my gosh, you're turning people off.
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:01.440]  You know what, these people are turned off, dude.
[03:57:02.400 --> 03:57:06.040]  And they're satanically charged, totally depraved.
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:08.120]  Only God can save them.
[03:57:09.280 --> 03:57:12.800]  And these people are willing to destroy your life
[03:57:12.800 --> 03:57:14.840]  and your children.
[03:57:14.840 --> 03:57:16.800]  There's only one way.
[03:57:16.800 --> 03:57:19.840]  There's only one way, and it's this way right now.
[03:57:19.840 --> 03:57:22.320]  We have to be open about this,
[03:57:22.320 --> 03:57:24.640]  not be afraid of speaking the truth,
[03:57:24.640 --> 03:57:27.160]  not be afraid of hurting people's feelings,
[03:57:27.160 --> 03:57:30.160]  and we have to get to the place where right now
[03:57:30.160 --> 03:57:32.240]  we are bold in the power of God,
[03:57:32.240 --> 03:57:34.560]  because that's the only way to defeat this.
[03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:35.800]  Thank you guys so much.
[03:57:35.800 --> 03:57:36.720]  My name is Drew Hernandez.

[03:58:49.080 --> 03:58:53.880]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist.
[03:58:53.880 --> 03:58:57.800]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[03:58:57.800 --> 03:59:00.320]  not just in America, but to the world.
[03:59:00.320 --> 03:59:03.800]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[03:59:03.800 --> 03:59:07.200]  in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[03:59:07.200 --> 03:59:10.200]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[03:59:10.200 --> 03:59:12.640]  who support in info wars are the real reason
[03:59:12.640 --> 03:59:14.360]  you've had the success.
[03:59:14.360 --> 03:59:17.200]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight
[03:59:17.200 --> 03:59:19.720]  against the new order we've ever had.
[03:59:19.720 --> 03:59:24.080]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:59:24.080 --> 03:59:27.160]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[03:59:27.160 --> 03:59:29.360]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[03:59:29.360 --> 03:59:31.960]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:33.320]  and to intensify them.
[03:59:33.320 --> 03:59:34.640]  God bless you all.
[03:59:34.640 --> 03:59:35.680]  I salute you.
[03:59:35.680 --> 03:59:36.720]  I thank you.
[03:59:36.720 --> 03:59:39.680]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[03:59:39.680 --> 03:59:42.880]  because we are over the target and this street is happening.
[03:59:42.880 --> 03:59:44.120]  The fight is my fight.
[03:59:44.120 --> 03:59:44.960]  It's your fight.
[03:59:44.960 --> 03:59:45.800]  It's our fight.
[03:59:45.800 --> 03:59:46.680]  God bless you all.
[03:59:50.800 --> 03:59:53.320]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:59:53.320 --> 04:00:11.280]  you are the resistance.
