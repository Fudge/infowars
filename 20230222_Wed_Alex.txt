[00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:19.976]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:33.620]  The film White Noise was released on Netflix in September of last year.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:44.563]  It's about a train crashing, exploding, and burning toxic chemicals off into the atmosphere, creating a major health hazard for miles around.
[00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:47.904]  Reflecting what just happened a few weeks ago in Ohio.
[00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:56.925]  White noise was even filmed in the same area, just a few miles from Ground Zero in East Palestine.
[00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:04.706]  Some people will call this a coincidence, but these days, believing in coincidence can cost you your life.
[00:01:04.706 --> 00:01:05.787]  And there is more.
[00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:16.229]  Just three months before the train wreck, the city of East Palestine began adopting the MyID digital bracelet system into their local emergency services.
[00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:28.259]  Being touted as the ultimate ID system, MyID is a digital ID company dealing primarily with digital ID bracelets for the medical industry.
[00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.907]  Bracelets designed to make it easier for first responders to access your medical profile in the event of an unexpected emergency.
[00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:44.353]  And just a week before the crash, they began handing these bracelets out to all the residents of East Palestine.
[00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:57.454]  Also, two weeks before the crash, the CDC updated their page on vinyl chloride, removing their section on how it affects children and raising the safe exposure threshold.
[00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:07.942]  Neil Donald Walsh wrote, there are no coincidences in the universe, only convergences of will, intent, and experience.
[00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:15.932]  Not only does the Ohio train crash appear to be a deliberate attack, it appears to potentially be a very deadly attack.
[00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:22.823]  Three days after the train wreck, authorities called for a controlled release burn.
[00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:35.146]  Controlled in that they would initiate the spark that will burn all the chemicals and cargo together in a massive chemical fire, potentially putting millions of people's lives at risk.
[00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:43.390]  The vinyl chloride spill at Camp Lejeune was small in comparison to what happened this month in Ohio.
[00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.193]  But it still poisoned over a million people and it took decades for the effects to materialize.
[00:02:50.193 --> 00:03:00.078]  A new federal lawsuit against Norfolk Southern alleges that 1.1 million pounds of vinyl chloride was spilled into the local environment.
[00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:11.787]  The vinyl chloride metabolite chloroethylene oxide attacks human DNA and can take years to start showing up as cancers and other disease.
[00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:16.130]  There is arguably no safe dose for exposure.
[00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:24.637]  Leading expert in the study of vinyl chloride, Dr. Julianne Baer, agrees and says that nobody should be drinking the local water.
[00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:31.620]  According to Dr. Baer, vinyl chloride gets transported into homes via the groundwater.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.283]  She says, it comes out of the water, into the air, and that's really the major route of toxicity for the liver.
[00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:40.263]  It comes through the air.
[00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:46.808]  While some argue that burning it resolved these issues, that seems to be false.
[00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:52.554]  Dioxins are the deadly toxins behind Agent Orange and DDT.
[00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:58.019]  They are generated when chlorinated chemicals, like vinyl chloride, burn.
[00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:14.781]  In fact, the exact reaction that happened in East Palestine, when they decided to burn vinyl chloride and PVC pellets together, was arguably the most efficient and deadly way of dispersing dioxins into the environment.
[00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:20.983]  And could equate to being one of the biggest chemical weapons attacks in history.
[00:04:20.983 --> 00:04:25.725]  Some are saying that tens of millions of lives could now be at risk.
[00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:34.727]  And that number will keep growing so long as humanity dismisses these attacks as coincidence and continues to do nothing.
[00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:39.088]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:40.928]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:40.928 --> 00:04:41.929]  It's Wednesday, February 22nd.
[00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.710]  2023.
[00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.852]  We have a huge guest in studio today.
[00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:47.513]  I'll tell you about it.
[00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:51.895]  When we come back, we obviously have masses of just insane news.
[00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:59.200]  My job's gotten a lot easier because the New World Order is in our face, pissing in our face, and we're going to stop them.
[00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.850]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.713]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:14.035]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:24.060]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.004]  Infowarstore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:32.024]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:32.925]  Back in stock.
[00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.266]  Nitric Boost.
[00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:40.029]  The amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.830]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.671]  Some of the very best products.
[00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:46.812]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:52.134]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:55.015]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[00:05:55.015 --> 00:05:56.356]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.877]  So again, please take action.
[00:05:57.877 --> 00:06:00.678]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:23.119]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:31.261]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:34.182]  All right, it's Wednesday, February 22nd, 2023.
[00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:37.122]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.122 --> 00:06:40.563]  Remember, this broadcast was supposed to already be off the air.
[00:06:41.528 --> 00:06:52.315]  Very powerful forces, including the FBI, the CIA, large corporations, think tanks have been working tirelessly, along with the corporate dinosaur media and big tech to shut us down.
[00:06:52.315 --> 00:07:01.462]  But because we have we the people, because we have you, because we're together, we are still on air, though battered and embattled, but battle-hardened.
[00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.810]  We're good to go.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.181]  You're not a participant in this.
[00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:25.902]  You are a MVP, most valuable player, in the fight.
[00:07:25.902 --> 00:07:31.183]  So let that sink in to your heads when you call in and thank me over and over again.
[00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:33.023]  No, I'm thanking you.
[00:07:33.023 --> 00:07:34.964]  Let that burn into your head.
[00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:37.865]  That's not to butter you up or kiss your ass.
[00:07:37.865 --> 00:07:39.565]  You are victory!
[00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:48.027]  When you get excited, when you take action, when you're informed, when you've got God on your side, when you're hitting your knees every night, we are unstoppable!
[00:07:51.698 --> 00:07:54.300]  World government is now out in the open.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.863]  In every poll and study around the world, it's wildly unpopular.
[00:07:57.863 --> 00:08:00.866]  And they got dressed down to their face by Elon Musk last week.
[00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:01.826]  And more is happening.
[00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:06.991]  I monitor the other big talk show hosts, the ones that aren't liberal or conservative, but are, quote, middle of the road.
[00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:09.252]  And it's not just Joe Rogan.
[00:08:09.252 --> 00:08:20.622]  The majority of them are turning against the establishment and turning against the globalists because they realize their own interest to live in a quasi-free, successful country or world are in trouble.
[00:08:22.608 --> 00:08:24.829]  Big article on this out of Vanity Fair yesterday.
[00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:25.610]  I didn't have time to get to it.
[00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.910]  I'm going to cover it more today.
[00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.692]  Now, I've known about this guy for over a decade.
[00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:32.813]  I mean, hell, back to the Iraq War.
[00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:37.116]  This is the second one, so I guess it's hard to believe that's 20 years ago, 2003.
[00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.917]  And producers are great.
[00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:40.858]  They book great guests.
[00:08:40.858 --> 00:08:43.439]  And I've asked a few times, hey, get Michael Yan on.
[00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.520]  For some reason, never happened.
[00:08:45.703 --> 00:08:46.805]  I knew he lived in Texas.
[00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:48.947]  He lives outside Austin, Dripping Springs.
[00:08:48.947 --> 00:08:52.691]  And then, boom, here he came walking through the door here, straight to be on with Mike Adams.
[00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:55.935]  So I said, will you please, in your busy schedule, come on for two hours tomorrow?
[00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:58.799]  And he obliged, saying he'd want to get on the show for years.
[00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.519]  So, wow.
[00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:03.558]  We're going to be as happy as two peas in a pod here.
[00:09:03.558 --> 00:09:05.460]  This guy has seen it all.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.945]  Long history in Special Forces, then as a journalist, as a pro-human activist.
[00:09:10.945 --> 00:09:16.250]  Just, man, this two hours, second and third hour, are going to go by so quick with Michael Young.
[00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:28.176]  In studio, he spent a lot of time last year over in the Netherlands, where it's the front line of the globalist assault to shut down farmers, when the Dutch are the third biggest food producers in the world.
[00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:32.078]  It will cause mass starvation, not there, but around the world.
[00:09:32.078 --> 00:09:33.498]  It's just, we're going to cover everything.
[00:09:33.498 --> 00:09:38.581]  World War III, the Ukraine situation with Michael Young, a super smart, super humble guy.
[00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:43.606]  And he's going to be with us talking about information war and more.
[00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:50.573]  Then, fourth hour hosted by the mighty, amazing, dynamic, you know it's true, Drew Hernandez.
[00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:54.797]  Such a brain and such a fiery speaker, he's got it all.
[00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:56.919]  He is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:07.518]  And I tell you, I sleep better at night knowing there are the Drew Hernandez's, there are the Chris Skyes, there are the Tucker Carlson's, there are the Kyle Rittenhouse's of the world.
[00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:16.905]  Speaking of Kyle Rittenhouse, the guy that admits he chased him down with a gun and pointed it at him with an intent to shoot him, is suing him for shooting him in the arm.
[00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:20.468]  Talk about incredible control that Kyle Rittenhouse showed.
[00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:24.691]  Because if you're aiming the gun at me and knocking it on the ground or pointing it at me, I'm going to shoot you in the chest.
[00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:29.797]  Rittenhouse basically blew half the guy's arm off to disarming.
[00:10:29.797 --> 00:10:32.279]  That is Obi-Wan Kenobi level stuff.
[00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:34.601]  Doesn't kill the guy, just cuts the arm off.
[00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:39.386]  Getting sued, and they think they'll get a judge and elect his venue and might win.
[00:10:39.386 --> 00:10:42.969]  But it's better to be tried by nine and carried by six, as they say.
[00:10:42.969 --> 00:10:44.791]  We'll be covering more of that.
[00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:51.199]  There's a lot I didn't get to yesterday, a lot I've got to cover today.
[00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:58.274]  We're going to jam it all into this hour, then intersperse more with our guests in the second and third hour ahead of the amazing Drew Hernandez.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.384]  Let me explain how I operate, because the politicians don't get this, the power structure doesn't get it, most of the audience gets it, but some people don't.
[00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:17.688]  And they think, Jones must be working for some special interest group, Jones must have some special funding, Jones must be taking orders from somebody.
[00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:25.712]  No, I'm just like a grassroots activist, I take orders from my own research and where God leads, guides and directs me.
[00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:26.032]  And so,
[00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:30.879]  I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater with Trump.
[00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:34.361]  The system legitimately hates his guts.
[00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.502]  He legitimately got elected.
[00:11:36.502 --> 00:11:40.423]  He legitimately called the shots himself or tried to.
[00:11:40.423 --> 00:11:42.424]  And presidents really since they took out Nixon
[00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:52.545]  This is admitted in PhD-level political science, are puppets of these Council on Foreign Relations Corporate Roundtable Committee of 300 groups.
[00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.365]  You say, well, which is it?
[00:11:53.365 --> 00:11:55.085]  The Club of Rome?
[00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:56.025]  The Demos Group?
[00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:57.085]  The CFR?
[00:11:57.085 --> 00:11:58.386]  The Trilateral Commission?
[00:11:58.386 --> 00:12:00.426]  There's like 20 dudes.
[00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:02.606]  They're all men.
[00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:06.327]  Almost all old white men, maybe one Asian person.
[00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:11.288]  There's one black guy that, you know, is in one of the high-level boards as well.
[00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:12.368]  But the point is, is that
[00:12:13.612 --> 00:12:20.458]  They're the ones pushing all the racial division and white people are bad, when meanwhile there are a bunch of old white men running this thing.
[00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:24.142]  And people ask, well, what is the most powerful group?
[00:12:24.142 --> 00:12:33.971]  It's 20 guys or less that sit as the chairman and the directors and the presidents and the heads of all of these globalist organizations, more than 100 of them.
[00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:46.275]  And that's what the Rockefellers really did a really good job of in an evil way in the last hundred years was setting up over a hundred national and international boards that they then give endless funding to
[00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:54.972]  To get their people put into positions of power in the bureaucracy, in the military, in industry, in banking, in academia, in government.
[00:12:54.972 --> 00:12:58.733]  That's why when Schwab talks about he penetrates the cabinets.
[00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:07.255]  They've got a bunch of globalist organizations that'll have hundreds or thousands of members depending on the group, but there's only about 20 people that head them.
[00:13:07.255 --> 00:13:13.437]  In fact, if you look at the main groups, there's four or five guys that are on more than half of the directorships.
[00:13:13.437 --> 00:13:15.978]  So it's four or five guys that are the
[00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:21.399]  Chairman of the boards of those groups, and then you've got another 15 or so that help them.
[00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:25.601]  So we're talking about 20 people that run these things.
[00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:32.685]  And man, they are eugenicists, they are transhumanist, they are anti-Christians, they are promoting pedophilia.
[00:13:32.685 --> 00:13:36.047]  When you see all the pedophilia and all the corruption and all the evil, it's them.
[00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:40.196]  Is Trump pig-headed?
[00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:41.737]  Does Trump have big blind spots?
[00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:42.318]  Absolutely.
[00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:46.181]  Does Trump convince himself something's the right thing to do and then never admit he's wrong?
[00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:46.962]  Yeah.
[00:13:46.962 --> 00:14:00.393]  That's a powerful attribute against the globalists, but it's also a powerful problem when he's wrong because he will not listen and he cannot be turned around in case he points to poison shots.
[00:14:00.393 --> 00:14:01.494]  That said, when we come back,
[00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:18.160]  I've been weighing who's better, DeSantis or Trump, and I've been openly throwing my support to Trump or DeSantis when one of them does the right thing, because we have leverage, all of us have leverage, on Congress, on these leaders, on these corporate leaders, to put pressure on them.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:25.444]  They're putting pressure on McCarthy to put out the January 6th video, now he says it's coming out in about a week and a half, Tucker's already been given access to it.
[00:14:25.444 --> 00:14:28.666]  So, we have power, they don't want us to use it, that's why they censor us.
[00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:32.328]  So, I haven't thrown Trump out with the bathwater, I've been very critical.
[00:14:33.578 --> 00:14:36.821]  To try to put pressure on him to do the right thing, to save lives and stop the poison shot.
[00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:41.726]  But without Trump, we're already doing that together, getting past the censors and working really hard.
[00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:42.727]  We've done an amazing job.
[00:14:42.727 --> 00:14:43.528]  You've done an amazing job.
[00:14:44.707 --> 00:14:46.048]  That's it.
[00:14:46.048 --> 00:14:54.551]  When DeSantis came out hardcore against the Poison Shots and has criminal investigations going, I said, okay, he just went up in the scales against Trump.
[00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:55.912]  He's a couple points ahead.
[00:14:55.912 --> 00:14:57.733]  I give it 52 to 48.
[00:14:57.733 --> 00:15:03.215]  DeSantis right now, in my heart, in my mind, who I think is better because I judge a tree by the fruits.
[00:15:04.827 --> 00:15:18.094]  Trump has aggressively, the last few months, been hammering this war, calling the globalist warmongers, explaining it's World War III, and really trying to rally people against the war, when nobody at his level is doing it.
[00:15:18.094 --> 00:15:21.275]  Not DeSantis, not really any of them.
[00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:23.116]  Rand Paul's been somewhat critical, but not much.
[00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:33.838]  With his anti-World War 3 stance, but believe me, he's dangerous to take with the power he's got, just pushed him way ahead of DeSantis.
[00:15:33.838 --> 00:15:36.600]  I'd say it's 60-40 right now in the scales.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.383]  Trump is way better than DeSantis right now.
[00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:44.187]  And I intend to put pressure on DeSantis, you should too, to come out against this war as well.
[00:15:44.727 --> 00:15:46.549]  He's been somewhat supporting it.
[00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:48.711]  This could end our civilization and life as we know it.
[00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:51.853]  So I'm going to come back with this very important Trump clip and more.
[00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:58.179]  But whether you're an AP reporter that calls out the Defense Department for starting the war, or whether you're Trump calling it out, everybody needs to do it right now.
[00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:08.096]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[00:16:08.096 --> 00:16:09.858]  World War III has already started.
[00:16:09.858 --> 00:16:12.180]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.341]  There's mass censorship.
[00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:15.543]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[00:16:15.543 --> 00:16:17.805]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[00:16:17.805 --> 00:16:22.169]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:26.391]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:34.814]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.

[00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:53.372]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[00:18:14.924 --> 00:18:25.171]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:36.999]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:38.540]  This is why they attack us.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.544]  This is why we need your support.
[00:18:41.544 --> 00:18:43.346]  Because we tell the truth.
[00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:45.549]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:46.971]  Join the resistance.

[00:18:51.457 --> 00:18:53.880]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.083]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:05.707]  I've been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:12.130]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.252]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:18.973]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:19:18.973 --> 00:19:25.396]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had the success.
[00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:31.537]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:35.858]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:19:35.858 --> 00:19:45.080]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.440]  God bless you all.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.481]  I salute you.
[00:19:47.481 --> 00:19:48.481]  I thank you.
[00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:53.942]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:19:54.582 --> 00:19:55.924]  The fight is my fight.
[00:19:55.924 --> 00:19:56.565]  It's your fight.
[00:19:56.565 --> 00:19:57.306]  It's our fight.
[00:19:57.306 --> 00:19:58.086]  God bless you all.
[00:21:00.922 --> 00:21:05.846]  Once you take the red pill, there's no going back.
[00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:11.110]  The Matrix is a documentary as they say.
[00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.131]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:29.284]  So let me finish the point I was making before I do this key Trump clip from last night that is absolute truth and goodness and makes him in my mind pull way ahead in the fruit of the tree analogy against the Santas.
[00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:40.277]  And we want to pit them against each other to make iron sharpen iron to get them both to really be hardcore against the New World Order.
[00:21:40.277 --> 00:21:41.998]  That's what the populace want.
[00:21:41.998 --> 00:21:42.979]  That's what's good.
[00:21:42.979 --> 00:21:44.279]  That's what's true.
[00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:44.960]  Let's do it.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.260]  We have the initiative.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.561]  The globalist agenda is horrible.
[00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:48.662]  Nobody wants it.
[00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:52.584]  Except for a tiny New World Order cabal of criminals, a cult.
[00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:57.042]  But I don't get up here and go, well, who'll give me money?
[00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:58.102]  Will it be the Sanders or Trump?
[00:21:58.102 --> 00:22:00.463]  I never got money from those guys in the RNC.
[00:22:00.463 --> 00:22:03.144]  I don't sit up here and say, what'll get me ahead with the system?
[00:22:03.144 --> 00:22:08.966]  I would've taken the offer to go meet Henry Kissinger when the head of the Kissinger Group tried to get me to go to New York 15 years ago.
[00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:10.107]  I would've taken the other deals.
[00:22:10.107 --> 00:22:15.529]  I would've taken the Fox News deal whenever they wanted to start me with a Saturday show.
[00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:19.210]  Again, 15, 14 years ago when I had the offers from Roger Ailes.
[00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:21.709]  I want to be independent.
[00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:24.190]  That's what's really valuable to me.
[00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:30.231]  Whether it's with a bullhorn on the side of the road or in a high-tech studio talking to millions of people, that's my goal.
[00:22:30.231 --> 00:22:33.012]  And so listeners get a little confused sometimes.
[00:22:33.012 --> 00:22:35.613]  They say, well, some days you're for DeSantis and some days you're for Trump.
[00:22:35.613 --> 00:22:36.373]  Are you flip-flopping?
[00:22:36.373 --> 00:22:45.695]  No, I'm always clear that I want them as major leaders that have a huge bully pulpit to promote issues of freedom and the truth.
[00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.252]  And so when Trump does something good, I support him.
[00:22:49.252 --> 00:22:51.535]  When Trump does something bad, I come after him.
[00:22:51.535 --> 00:22:53.757]  When DeSantis does something good, I support him.
[00:22:53.757 --> 00:22:56.019]  When DeSantis does something bad, I come out against him.
[00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:58.001]  It's real simple.
[00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:06.088]  I'm not here like I'm judging a Miss America contest of who the better candidate is because of how they look, or who's got a better suit, or who spoke better.
[00:23:06.088 --> 00:23:08.431]  I care about results.
[00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:22.156]  Rand Paul certainly, he's a good speaker, but he doesn't have a lot of charisma, but I love him and think he'd be a great president because he's smart and has really good policy ideas.
[00:23:22.156 --> 00:23:28.837]  I don't care about how good a speaker you are, I care about what you stand for and your integrity, and that's what we should all stand for.
[00:23:28.837 --> 00:23:31.418]  What is the results of what you produce?
[00:23:31.418 --> 00:23:36.920]  My grandfather would always tell my dad, me when I was little, I don't want to hear talk, I want results.
[00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.189]  I don't want to hear about how you're going to do this.
[00:23:40.189 --> 00:23:44.050]  I want to see how you're going to do this.
[00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.211]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:53.214]  And so with what Trump has done, we got all the big World War III news here, because we're in the beginning of World War III, make no mistake.
[00:23:53.214 --> 00:23:55.414]  The question is, will it go nuclear?
[00:23:55.414 --> 00:23:56.075]  Will it go chemical?
[00:23:56.075 --> 00:23:57.015]  Will it go biological?
[00:23:57.015 --> 00:23:58.375]  Will it go cyber attack?
[00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:04.017]  And they've already cyber attacked and took Putin's speech off TV and off the internet two days ago, and a giant attack on Russia.
[00:24:04.017 --> 00:24:04.918]  I mean, we're already there.
[00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:07.667]  The escalation is already out of control.
[00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:09.028]  The question is, can it be contained?
[00:24:09.028 --> 00:24:11.931]  Can it be wound back down?
[00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:21.060]  The way it's going to do that is, if we've got, depending on the poll, there's hundreds of them, but they're all on the low end, 75 to 87 percent.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.063]  We've covered the polls, covered another one that was in the high 80s yesterday.
[00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:32.877]  That 80% on average of the American people do not want this damn war, plus it hasn't been declared, and it's illegal.
[00:24:32.877 --> 00:24:37.201]  But we've been slip-walked into it because we'd never support a war with Russia, just start one day like that.
[00:24:37.201 --> 00:24:39.984]  We'd say, that's crazy, don't do it.
[00:24:39.984 --> 00:24:43.567]  But if they can slowly escalate it, they can get what they want.
[00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:48.932]  But if we see things, like the AP reporter who nailed Kirby
[00:24:50.094 --> 00:24:58.276]  I think Putin made a big mistake walking into a trap, but I can see what we would do if folks were overthrowing countries on our doorstep and manipulating political movements inside our country.
[00:25:15.293 --> 00:25:16.274]  Overthrow our government.
[00:25:16.274 --> 00:25:17.735]  But see, that's what the globalists have done.
[00:25:17.735 --> 00:25:19.356]  It's not been the Russians overthrew the U.S.
[00:25:19.356 --> 00:25:20.517]  government and got control of it.
[00:25:20.517 --> 00:25:23.500]  It's been the New World Order allied with China.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.001]  Now they've split with the Chinese.
[00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:35.129]  There's a rift right now, but they're still, for their goals, a worldwide corporate, fascist, control grid, cashless society, market-to-be system.
[00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:37.231]  They're Simpatico, the Chai Khams of the New World Order.
[00:25:38.544 --> 00:25:48.031]  But just like Hitler and Stalin splitting in the middle of World War II when they had an armistice and a pact, an agreement before, the same things happened with China.
[00:25:48.031 --> 00:25:53.574]  So we're entering that moment in history where more happens in a year than happened in the previous 50.
[00:25:53.574 --> 00:25:56.176]  We're entering a very fluid, dangerous point.
[00:25:56.176 --> 00:26:01.460]  And what we need to see is Rand Paul not just calling for Fauci to be arrested, that's great.
[00:26:02.588 --> 00:26:07.590]  But coming out against the war full-throatedly with press conferences and making the rounds.
[00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:13.813]  And we need to see constituents of Senator Johnson, who's a great guy, call him up and say, knock off the warmongering.
[00:26:13.813 --> 00:26:15.094]  We need demonstrations.
[00:26:15.094 --> 00:26:16.314]  We need peaceful action.
[00:26:16.314 --> 00:26:18.075]  We need civil disobedience.
[00:26:18.075 --> 00:26:30.141]  We need to take action like we did with the poison shots, and we can back this thing down and put the genie back in the bottle, but there's not much time, because the road we're going down very quickly leads to nuclear war.
[00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:33.969]  And everybody knows that's a fact.
[00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:35.891]  So I salute Trump.
[00:26:35.891 --> 00:26:42.176]  He said we need a clean house of all warmongers and American last globalists in national security industrial complex.
[00:26:42.176 --> 00:26:43.717]  World War III has never been closer.
[00:26:43.717 --> 00:26:44.898]  Yeah, we're in it.
[00:26:44.898 --> 00:26:45.919]  Than it is right now.
[00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:51.243]  Trump thrashes America's last globalist over Ukraine war.
[00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:52.965]  And it goes on from there.
[00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:54.526]  Demented warmongers and globalists.
[00:26:54.526 --> 00:26:58.849]  Here's what Trump had to say.
[00:26:58.849 --> 00:26:59.050]  Clip 14.
[00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:06.430]  World War III has never been closer than it is right now.
[00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:18.438]  We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America's last globalists and the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the National Security Industrial Complex.
[00:27:18.438 --> 00:27:19.158]  You know what?
[00:27:19.158 --> 00:27:19.938]  It's my fault.
[00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:21.199]  It's a three and a half minute clip.
[00:27:21.199 --> 00:27:21.880]  I didn't look at it.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.900]  I thought it was a two minute clip.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.941]  There's another clip here of Trump that's two minutes.
[00:27:24.941 --> 00:27:25.962]  So I went to that late.
[00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:28.023]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes and come back with it.
[00:27:28.023 --> 00:27:29.864]  It's just too important to have it cut off by the break.
[00:27:31.761 --> 00:27:38.887]  Again, DeSantis was 2-3 points ahead in my mind of judging a tree by its fruits a month ago.
[00:27:38.887 --> 00:27:42.029]  He was 52-48 against Trump.
[00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:45.652]  53-47 in my mind, how my mind counts these beans.
[00:27:45.652 --> 00:27:47.334]  You've got your own view and you're welcome to it.
[00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:50.016]  I'd love to take calls tomorrow and hear what you think about this.
[00:27:50.016 --> 00:27:53.479]  But DeSantis was ahead of Trump in action.
[00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:55.840]  Not now with this, and he's given a bunch of other speeches.
[00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.236]  This is what we need to hear.
[00:27:58.236 --> 00:27:59.536]  This is what's going on.
[00:27:59.536 --> 00:28:05.279]  And look, we spend a lot of time on the train derailment, the horrible fire, the dioxin, and it's important.
[00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:07.240]  And it's really bad for people in the area.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.242]  But compared to nuclear war, it doesn't even show up on the Richter scale.
[00:28:12.242 --> 00:28:17.425]  And the same people ignoring what's happened in Ohio are the ones pushing us into nuclear war.
[00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:19.386]  So, yeah, let's focus on Ohio.
[00:28:20.602 --> 00:28:26.246]  And let's pressure the EPA that's finally going in there to try to clean this up.
[00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:29.668]  Let's find out who gave the orders to blow this up and burn this up.
[00:28:29.668 --> 00:28:36.153]  When it creates this deadly dioxin, when you add those chemicals together, any chemistry first-year student would know that in college.
[00:28:36.153 --> 00:28:40.976]  But can we focus a little more on World War III and the collapsed border and all of that?
[00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:45.259]  Because this is the nation-ending events that we're witnessing.
[00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:46.600]  So we're going to go on a break.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.061]  I'm going to come back with a Trump clip and a lot more.
[00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:49.982]  This is big, though.
[00:28:50.804 --> 00:28:54.838]  And yeah, no, I'm behind Trump right now for president.
[00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:56.163]  I'm supporting him for president right now.
[00:29:02.162 --> 00:29:11.864]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[00:29:51.203 --> 00:29:53.624]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:29:53.624 --> 00:29:54.504]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:29:54.504 --> 00:29:56.065]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:29:56.065 --> 00:30:00.607]  You can get them right now.

[00:32:11.992 --> 00:32:16.136]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[00:32:16.136 --> 00:32:18.798]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.341]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[00:32:25.341 --> 00:32:27.342]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:29.183]  So please, keep me on the field.

[00:32:53.931 --> 00:33:01.133]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[00:33:01.133 --> 00:33:07.015]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.804 --> 00:33:28.646]  Alright, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.646 --> 00:33:39.089]  Alright, really smart, informative guest to cover the waterfront, coming in studio next hour, definitely don't want to miss that.
[00:33:39.089 --> 00:33:41.250]  Let me just get back to where I am on this Trump situation.
[00:33:42.611 --> 00:33:50.318]  DeSantis has been supporting the Ukraine war, and that is a big black mark on him, and he needs to come out against that.
[00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:53.962]  I understand he's a governor of a state, but he can't have his cake and eat it too.
[00:33:53.962 --> 00:33:55.863]  We all know he's running for president.
[00:33:55.863 --> 00:33:58.226]  So if he comes out full-throatedly against the war,
[00:34:00.134 --> 00:34:03.396]  He will then be better than Trump, because Trump's bad on the shot.
[00:34:03.396 --> 00:34:06.418]  But currently, World War III is the most dangerous thing we're facing.
[00:34:06.418 --> 00:34:11.182]  Trump is putting his money where his mouth is and doing things that are totally bugging the system.
[00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:14.004]  I have to morally then say, I support Trump.
[00:34:14.004 --> 00:34:17.886]  And it's not a lesser of two evils.
[00:34:17.886 --> 00:34:18.967]  I'm not supporting Biden.
[00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:23.911]  I'm not supporting Gavin Newsom, because the word is Biden's probably not going to run.
[00:34:23.911 --> 00:34:25.572]  That's coming out now.
[00:34:25.572 --> 00:34:26.232]  Obviously, he can't.
[00:34:26.232 --> 00:34:26.973]  The guy can barely talk.
[00:34:28.206 --> 00:34:32.848]  If you got a choice between Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump, you can't go with Gavin Newsom, obviously.
[00:34:32.848 --> 00:34:34.069]  But that's not the issue.
[00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:43.373]  The issue is putting pressure on Trump and DeSantis and the Republicans to stop all the World War III and poison shot garbage.
[00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:48.375]  But tomorrow, I'll open the phones up on this subject, Trump or DeSantis, or maybe you don't want either one.
[00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:50.436]  Well, then what are we going to do?
[00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:53.998]  Because believe me, I am so frustrated by Jared Kushner.
[00:34:55.268 --> 00:35:00.112]  And Trump giving a bunch of rhetoric against censorship, but doing nothing, then it bit him in the ass.
[00:35:00.112 --> 00:35:01.853]  I got big problems with Trump.
[00:35:01.853 --> 00:35:04.295]  I don't care about being patted on the head by Trump.
[00:35:04.295 --> 00:35:10.960]  If that Trump stopped calling me years ago, because I'd talk to him about policy, and I'd say, I don't want to hear how great I am.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.221]  I'm not one of your donors.
[00:35:12.221 --> 00:35:14.402]  I want action against the deep state.
[00:35:14.402 --> 00:35:24.090]  And Obama put almost $3 billion in with this breakaway network inside the government to censor the American people with the CIA and the Defense Department and the Justice Department.
[00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:34.916]  And I would tell them the legislation name, the Defense Authorization Act 2017, signing the law before Obama left, the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:35:36.607 --> 00:35:38.227]  And Trump will get frustrated.
[00:35:38.227 --> 00:35:44.989]  I'm like, dude, I'm not here to be petted like a little kitty cat and I purr in your lap and I feel good because a big famous president's calling me.
[00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:46.889]  I don't give a hell about that.
[00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:49.329]  I don't give a damn about Hollywood.
[00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:55.651]  I had Hollywood offer me the big roles if I would just go along with them 15 years ago.
[00:35:55.651 --> 00:35:59.891]  That's when the big offers came from Hollywood and Henry Kissinger and all of them.
[00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:02.932]  And I told them, piss up a rope because
[00:36:03.192 --> 00:36:07.436]  Who wants to be a Hollywood star when America collapses and you're in World War III?
[00:36:07.436 --> 00:36:10.618]  Who wants to be part of the elite that's screwing everybody over?
[00:36:10.618 --> 00:36:12.760]  That's not a hard offer to turn down.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.363]  You couldn't put a gun to my head and make me follow it.
[00:36:16.363 --> 00:36:21.127]  I only tell you those stories, folks, because you understand how real this is.
[00:36:21.127 --> 00:36:22.788]  Almost everybody else took the money.
[00:36:22.788 --> 00:36:28.293]  Almost everybody else sold out.
[00:36:28.293 --> 00:36:29.194]  But we the people didn't.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:40.045]  And so we're at this point right now, where I have to say what Trump is doing against the war, he's given a bunch of these speeches, is absolutely essential.
[00:36:40.045 --> 00:36:43.587]  The only thing he's wrong about is saying World War III could start any day.
[00:36:43.587 --> 00:36:45.588]  He thinks that World War III is nuclear.
[00:36:45.588 --> 00:36:58.496]  World War III is just a big conflict between major powers that starts breaking out around the world, and Israel's bombing Iran, China's making big moves in the South China Sea, they're all talking about full war,
[00:36:59.597 --> 00:37:01.218]  It's already here.
[00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:03.199]  So here's what Trump had to say last night.
[00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:06.360]  The full video is on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.082]  World War III has never been closer than it is right now.
[00:37:10.082 --> 00:37:21.847]  We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America's last globalists in the deep state, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the National Security Industrial Complex.
[00:37:22.467 --> 00:37:41.963]  One of the reasons I was the only president in generations who didn't start a war is that I was the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of Washington's generals, bureaucrats, and the so-called diplomats who only know how to get us into conflict, but they don't know how to get us out.
[00:37:42.543 --> 00:37:57.737]  For decades we've had the very same people such as Victoria Nuland and many others just like her obsessed with pushing Ukraine toward NATO, not to mention the State Department support for uprisings in Ukraine.
[00:37:58.297 --> 00:38:10.368]  These people have been seeking confrontation for a long time, much like the case in Iraq and other parts of the world, and now we're teetering on the brink of World War III.
[00:38:10.368 --> 00:38:14.731]  And a lot of people don't see it, but I see it, and I've been right about a lot of things.
[00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:17.154]  They all say Trump's been right about everything.
[00:38:17.814 --> 00:38:30.820]  None of this excuses in any way the outrageous and horrible invasion of Ukraine one year ago, which would have never happened if I was your president, not even a little chance.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:42.285]  But it does mean that here in America, we need to get rid of the corrupt globalist establishment that has botched every major foreign policy decision for decades.
[00:38:42.285 --> 00:38:44.346]  And that includes President Biden.
[00:38:44.966 --> 00:38:53.293]  Who's own people said he's never made a good decision when it comes to looking at other countries and looking at wars.
[00:38:53.293 --> 00:38:57.457]  We have to replace them with people who support American interests.
[00:38:57.457 --> 00:39:05.104]  Over our four years in the White House, we made incredible progress in putting the America last contingent aside.
[00:39:05.664 --> 00:39:08.286]  And bringing the world to peace.
[00:39:08.286 --> 00:39:11.469]  And now, we're going to complete the mission.
[00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:19.415]  The State Department, Pentagon, and National Security Establishment will be a very different place by the end of my administration.
[00:39:19.415 --> 00:39:24.118]  In fact, just into my administration, it'll be a very different place.
[00:39:24.118 --> 00:39:28.442]  And it'll get things done, just like I did four years ago.
[00:39:28.442 --> 00:39:29.783]  We never had it so good.
[00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:49.259]  We'll also stop the lobbyists and the big defense contractors from going in and pushing our senior military and national security officials toward conflict, only to reward them when they retire with lucrative jobs, getting paid millions and millions of dollars.
[00:39:49.259 --> 00:39:54.203]  Take a look at the globalist warmonger donors backing our opponents.
[00:39:54.203 --> 00:39:56.484]  That's because they're candidates of war.
[00:39:57.305 --> 00:40:02.352]  I am the president who delivers peace, and it's peace through strength.
[00:40:02.352 --> 00:40:04.555]  There was a reason we had no conflict.
[00:40:04.555 --> 00:40:09.081]  There was a reason we didn't get into wars, because other countries respected us.
[00:40:09.081 --> 00:40:13.827]  I entirely built all right from the beginning, rebuilt our military.
[00:40:14.488 --> 00:40:16.109]  It's a big reason for that.
[00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:20.512]  They didn't want to mess around with the United States, and now they're laughing at us.
[00:40:20.512 --> 00:40:25.114]  We could end the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours with the right leadership.
[00:40:25.114 --> 00:40:42.044]  At the end of my next four years, the warmongers and frauds and failures of the senior ranks of our government will all be gone, and we will have a new group of competent national security officials who believe in defending America's vital interests above all else.
[00:40:42.044 --> 00:40:42.865]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:44.346 --> 00:40:46.468]  All right, that's a three and a half minute clip.
[00:40:46.468 --> 00:40:49.551]  I could spend months deciphering it.
[00:40:49.551 --> 00:41:03.903]  Everything you said is true about the deep state, the revolving doors, the system designing failure, the danger of accelerated war beyond World War III, nuclear war.
[00:41:03.903 --> 00:41:05.845]  That was an important speech.
[00:41:05.845 --> 00:41:07.627]  And you got to support Trump doing that.
[00:41:09.693 --> 00:41:11.174]  Courage and truth is contagious.
[00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:12.575]  We need to see this everywhere.
[00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:21.279]  We're going to go to break, come back into the latest World War III news, a bunch of poison shot news, the latest on the economy, and so much more.
[00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:23.880]  Rittenhouse, January 6th, you name it.

[00:41:55.292 --> 00:42:00.016]  Concentrated bone broth costs the same amount as this without all the added ingredients that are in it.
[00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:01.638]  This is a superfood.
[00:42:01.638 --> 00:42:02.519]  It is amazing.
[00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:04.981]  It's in the store now.

[00:42:53.419 --> 00:42:53.839]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:08.968]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[00:43:08.968 --> 00:43:10.729]  World War III has already started.
[00:43:10.729 --> 00:43:13.051]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[00:43:13.051 --> 00:43:14.212]  There's mass censorship.
[00:43:14.212 --> 00:43:16.414]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[00:43:16.414 --> 00:43:18.675]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[00:43:18.675 --> 00:43:23.139]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[00:43:23.319 --> 00:43:27.261]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:35.686]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at Infowarshore.com.
[00:43:35.686 --> 00:43:44.351]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the great reset in the War for the World, or Ultimate Bone Broth, finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at Infowarshore.com.

[00:44:10.627 --> 00:44:14.531]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:44:14.531 --> 00:44:19.436]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:44:19.716 --> 00:44:25.880]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:34.526]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:44:34.526 --> 00:44:40.210]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:45.634]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:44:45.874 --> 00:44:48.356]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:44:48.356 --> 00:44:51.019]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:52.520]  So go check out the store.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.721]  Go support their store.

[00:44:56.584 --> 00:44:58.085]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:45:01.983 --> 00:45:06.866]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:45:06.866 --> 00:45:13.271]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:45:13.271 --> 00:45:18.394]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:45:18.394 --> 00:45:20.115]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:45:20.115 --> 00:45:21.236]  Yes, I persevered.
[00:45:21.236 --> 00:45:26.560]  But the listeners and viewers who supported Infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:32.681]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:45:32.681 --> 00:45:36.842]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:45:36.842 --> 00:45:46.244]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:47.584]  God bless you all.
[00:45:47.584 --> 00:45:48.625]  I salute you.
[00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:49.385]  I thank you.
[00:45:49.385 --> 00:45:55.106]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:45:55.766 --> 00:45:57.068]  The fight is my fight.
[00:45:57.068 --> 00:45:57.709]  It's your fight.
[00:45:57.709 --> 00:45:58.450]  It's our fight.
[00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.211]  God bless you all.

[00:47:01.167 --> 00:47:05.779]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.779 --> 00:47:07.082]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:38.701 --> 00:47:42.926]  Coming up for two hours in studio, Michael Yon.
[00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:45.028]  You don't want to miss this.
[00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:45.909]  Can't wait to interview him.
[00:47:48.274 --> 00:47:52.015]  All right, getting back to the World War III situation here.
[00:47:52.015 --> 00:47:54.555]  World War III has never been closer than this right now.
[00:47:54.555 --> 00:47:58.336]  Trump trashes America's last globalist over Ukraine war.
[00:47:58.336 --> 00:48:00.497]  Says the deep state has had a coup over America.
[00:48:00.497 --> 00:48:02.157]  They've got to be removed.
[00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:07.938]  I mean, this is directly challenging the people that have hijacked this country.
[00:48:07.938 --> 00:48:13.459]  We need a clean house of all warmongers in America's last globalist and national security industrial complex.
[00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:15.940]  Trump vows to oust demented warmongers and globalists.
[00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:18.331]  Other war news.
[00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:27.197]  China says ready to join forces with Russia, close quote, to defend national interest, close quote, as Putin confirms Xi visit during the war.
[00:48:27.197 --> 00:48:31.441]  Biden confesses Nord Stream terror attack again in Warsaw.
[00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:34.303]  Remember he bragged he'd blow it up, so did Victoria Nuland.
[00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:40.367]  We mobilize to reduce dependence on Russian energy.
[00:48:40.367 --> 00:48:43.750]  Putin's speech he gave two days ago threatens nuclear war.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.722]  Russia running low on Iranian drones.
[00:48:47.722 --> 00:48:50.845]  Biden and Putin deliver dueling fiery speeches.
[00:48:50.845 --> 00:48:50.965]  U.S.
[00:48:50.965 --> 00:48:56.571]  believes Russia has failed its intercontinental ballistic test of the Satan 2 missile.
[00:48:56.571 --> 00:48:57.752]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:48:57.752 --> 00:49:01.856]  Xi Jinping plans Russia visit as Putin wages war in Ukraine.
[00:49:01.856 --> 00:49:02.697]  That is a big deal.
[00:49:04.727 --> 00:49:05.808]  Something bothering you both?
[00:49:05.808 --> 00:49:15.957]  Zelensky shares very frosty meeting with Italian Prime Minister as Rome refuses to send fighter jets a week after her coalition partner, Burson, only blamed Kiev for the war.
[00:49:15.957 --> 00:49:18.138]  And now the AP reporter is saying it.
[00:49:18.138 --> 00:49:19.860]  And Trump's saying it.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.821]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:23.623]  That does not defend what Putin has done.
[00:49:23.623 --> 00:49:27.026]  I think it was bad that he invaded and took the bait.
[00:49:27.026 --> 00:49:32.831]  Not very smart, but I guess at the end of the day it'll just make Putin's grip on Russia that much stronger.
[00:49:34.192 --> 00:49:39.894]  I guess as they say, war is the health of the state.
[00:49:39.894 --> 00:49:41.815]  Look at this disgusting headline.
[00:49:41.815 --> 00:49:43.656]  Left-wing historian.
[00:49:43.656 --> 00:49:49.358]  Biden's Ukraine visit was presidential bravery not seen since Lincoln.
[00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:52.859]  Talk about needing a barf bag.
[00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:55.400]  Talk about disgusting.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.282]  But it's all coming out about the Nord Stream pipeline, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:00.856 --> 00:50:03.258]  It's all beginning to come out.
[00:50:03.258 --> 00:50:15.611]  And while we're focused on the war, the UN's getting ready, the big Marburg scare, they're getting ready with all the attacks on our food and infrastructure, grid.
[00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:23.378]  We've got Top Banker says UK will introduce a super app that combines digital and financial data within the year.
[00:50:23.378 --> 00:50:24.760]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:26.843 --> 00:50:28.464]  We mentioned this yesterday, but here are the articles.
[00:50:28.464 --> 00:50:37.290]  Physical attacks on power grid, surge to new peak, Politico, Wall Street Journal, all reporting what we told you we were tracking.
[00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:43.215]  Power grid attacks are likely to continue, study finds.
[00:50:43.215 --> 00:50:43.955]  Attacks on the U.S.
[00:50:43.955 --> 00:50:48.538]  power grid are surging.
[00:50:48.538 --> 00:50:51.781]  The civilization is being purposely collapsed.
[00:50:52.674 --> 00:50:53.935]  Right now.
[00:50:53.935 --> 00:50:57.056]  And the question is, why are we putting up with it?
[00:50:57.056 --> 00:51:06.400]  So, about a year and a half ago, we all saw Biden fall down repeatedly going up the stairs to Puppet One or Air Force One.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:15.284]  Well, leaving Poland, he fell down again while scrabbling up the stairs.
[00:51:15.284 --> 00:51:18.046]  And again, this is so emblematic of somebody with dementia,
[00:51:18.939 --> 00:51:26.823]  With serious cognitive problems, who's a puppet of the globalists, and of course, Barack Obama's third unelected administration.
[00:51:26.823 --> 00:51:34.206]  But he really thinks he's president, and he really thinks he's dynamic, and he really thinks he can scrabble up the stairs.
[00:51:34.206 --> 00:51:37.348]  He's like an old dog that can't hunt anymore, but he thinks he can.
[00:51:37.348 --> 00:51:41.490]  And that's emblematic of where our republic is, led by these skeletons.
[00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.050]  I mean, I played the clip yesterday.
[00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:43.971]  Cue that up if you can find it.
[00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:47.148]  And the whole two-hour speech is insane.
[00:51:47.148 --> 00:51:53.554]  George Soros, in Germany last week, gave a speech where you couldn't understand half of it.
[00:51:53.554 --> 00:52:01.521]  And again, this is a guy, to a great extent, calling the shots more than even Joe Biden.
[00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:10.990]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[00:52:12.872 --> 00:52:30.505]  That's who's running our country and starting wars with Russia.
[00:52:42.421 --> 00:52:45.062]  That's who thinks they're in complete control of society.
[00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:49.525]  Now, let me get to the poison shot stack before our guest comes in.
[00:52:49.525 --> 00:52:53.927]  This is a small smattering of today's news.
[00:52:53.927 --> 00:53:00.771]  Vaccinated, over-represented in all cases, deaths, ONS data shows.
[00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:04.593]  That's just out of England, the only country putting out some data.
[00:53:04.593 --> 00:53:09.316]  But the insurance companies, they have the data around the world, and I'll show you a map
[00:53:10.967 --> 00:53:25.419]  Just in Europe, of where all the excess deaths are, highest rate ever recorded, and it is completely corresponding to the level of the amount of shots of the so-called vaccine people are taking.
[00:53:25.419 --> 00:53:33.325]  Dr. Fauci comes clean on vaccines, respiratory viruses, suddenly comes out and says they don't work.
[00:53:33.325 --> 00:53:35.027]  Israel court offered Ministry of Health
[00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:42.301]  Israeli court ordered the Ministry of Health to release the agreement with Pfizer.
[00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:47.305]  These two pages contain the section titled, Liability and Indemnity Provision.
[00:53:47.305 --> 00:53:50.708]  99% of it is blacked out.
[00:53:50.708 --> 00:53:52.789]  I wish this was a joke, but it's not.
[00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:54.751]  And look at what they released.
[00:53:54.751 --> 00:54:01.736]  The fact that it gives them indemnity and freedom from any liability, to give experimental shots to us, and 99% of it is blacked out.
[00:54:05.871 --> 00:54:08.053]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:54:08.053 --> 00:54:10.595]  And I have this clip out of Canada.
[00:54:10.595 --> 00:54:14.157]  I'm kind of springing this on you guys to see if you can find it in yesterday's list.
[00:54:14.157 --> 00:54:20.222]  Liberal explains, this is the lawyer for the government, vaccine contracts with no liability clause.
[00:54:20.222 --> 00:54:24.685]  And he goes on to say, well, we didn't know what it would do and it might really hurt people.
[00:54:24.685 --> 00:54:27.507]  So we gave them full liability protection.
[00:54:27.507 --> 00:54:28.628]  I thought it was all tested.
[00:54:28.628 --> 00:54:29.549]  I thought it was all great.
[00:54:31.254 --> 00:54:34.415]  We'll get to that in a moment, but first, this is so bad.
[00:54:34.415 --> 00:54:38.017]  Massive amounts of excess deaths, and nobody seems to know why.
[00:54:38.017 --> 00:54:41.138]  What do you think's causing this?
[00:54:41.138 --> 00:54:42.779]  Asked Peter Sweden.
[00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:51.843]  And it shows the death numbers, and as you go up, in the higher vaccinated areas, you get the higher death rates.
[00:54:51.843 --> 00:54:58.306]  Notice, in Russia, and Eastern Europe, and Turkey, and everywhere else, there's no excess deaths.
[00:54:59.977 --> 00:55:07.242]  But the more a country submits and forces its population to take it, the higher the death rate.
[00:55:07.242 --> 00:55:11.005]  Here are those numbers, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:20.161]  But on average, it's a 56% increase in death when you average all age groups together from the shots.
[00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:21.881]  Here's a lawyer breaking it down.
[00:55:21.881 --> 00:55:23.681]  Criminal indictments, the U.S.
[00:55:23.681 --> 00:55:39.805]  Department of Defense, along with Fauci, Gates, Tedros, Moderna, Pfizer, FDA, CDC, WEF, CIA, and others, willfully and criminally engaged in racketeering, illegal advertising, fraud, and mass premeditated murder of millions of innocent people worldwide.
[00:55:40.674 --> 00:55:44.958]  It's being testified to by international organizations.
[00:55:44.958 --> 00:55:49.403]  But don't worry, they think you'll forget the last virus with the new virus.
[00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:55.429]  Who convenes urgent meeting over outbreak of deadly Marburg virus that kills 90% of those infected?
[00:55:55.429 --> 00:56:03.497]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of the government lawyer explains vaccine contracts with no liability clause in Canada.
[00:56:05.629 --> 00:56:13.637]  These agreements require employees of the government of candidates that access these documents to sign confidentiality agreements.
[00:56:13.637 --> 00:56:14.718]  And why is that?
[00:56:14.718 --> 00:56:20.424]  Why is there much more redactions, as my colleague said, in these documents than in other documents?
[00:56:20.424 --> 00:56:24.328]  It's because these documents were signed at the beginning of a pandemic.
[00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:36.091]  When everybody was desperate for vaccines, when companies were being told to rush vaccine production, do testing in an unprecedented way, in a way they normally don't do it.
[00:56:36.091 --> 00:56:48.134]  So these companies were exposed to way higher liability, putting their products on the market than they normally would, because they didn't do the type of testing that normally takes these drugs years to come to market.
[00:56:48.134 --> 00:56:49.974]  They did it all in less than a year.
[00:56:51.167 --> 00:57:00.510]  So that's why these companies said, if I'm going to deliver you this product that I haven't tested in my normal way, I want to have different conditions.
[00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:07.172]  And with companies, all countries around the world competing with each other to get these, the countries had less leverage than they normally do.
[00:57:07.172 --> 00:57:15.535]  For example, if we were entering into flu vaccine contracts or monkeypox contracts or other things that were normally available,
[00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.032]  This would be a different issue.
[00:57:19.032 --> 00:57:20.393]  But these are already signed.
[00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:23.476]  They were signed at a time the government didn't have that leverage in negotiations.
[00:57:23.476 --> 00:57:26.998]  We just wanted to sign as many vaccine contracts with as many producers as possible.
[00:57:26.998 --> 00:57:30.281]  Because Canadians were desperate for vaccines and in the end it worked out.
[00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:34.745]  We got vaccines and we were one of the countries that got to vaccinate everybody the fastest.
[00:57:36.124 --> 00:57:38.646]  But it didn't work out unless you learned to kill a bunch of people.
[00:57:38.646 --> 00:57:45.331]  There was the same program stampeding people into submission all over the world and now there's a UN treaty to take control of our bodies.
[00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:47.292]  Hour number two straight ahead, you don't want to miss this.
[00:57:52.344 --> 00:58:02.049]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[00:58:02.049 --> 00:58:05.730]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:12.674]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsTore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.

[00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:22.481]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:24.222]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[00:58:24.222 --> 00:58:32.268]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right down at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:32.268 --> 00:58:41.194]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[00:58:41.374 --> 00:58:43.815]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:58:43.815 --> 00:58:44.715]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:58:44.715 --> 00:58:46.375]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:58:46.375 --> 00:58:50.696]  You can get them right now.
[00:58:50.696 --> 00:58:56.437]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at The Wellness Company.
[00:58:56.437 --> 00:59:00.318]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[00:59:00.318 --> 00:59:03.078]  I contribute like so many else do there.
[00:59:03.078 --> 00:59:04.859]  So many wonderful doctors.
[00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:10.480]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.301]  That features natokinase.
[00:59:12.301 --> 00:59:14.643]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[00:59:14.643 --> 00:59:20.346]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[00:59:20.346 --> 00:59:21.127]  This is very important.
[00:59:21.127 --> 00:59:26.170]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:27.671]  People are low with the spike protein.
[00:59:27.671 --> 00:59:28.631]  They don't feel well.
[00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.332]  This is a potential solution.
[00:59:30.332 --> 00:59:33.394]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[00:59:33.394 --> 00:59:36.316]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[00:59:36.316 --> 00:59:37.277]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:59:37.657 --> 00:59:43.764]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[00:59:43.764 --> 00:59:48.289]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:53.615]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[00:59:53.615 --> 00:59:57.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.134 --> 01:00:01.955]  When you have U.S.
[01:00:01.955 --> 01:00:11.899]  Senators in both parties saying, we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:16.280]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.881]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:21.622]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[01:00:21.622 --> 01:00:25.884]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[01:00:26.864 --> 01:00:33.948]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[01:00:33.948 --> 01:00:35.969]  Think of their ignorance.
[01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:45.175]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[01:00:45.755 --> 01:00:50.016]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[01:00:50.016 --> 01:00:55.837]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[01:00:55.837 --> 01:00:58.858]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[01:00:58.858 --> 01:01:02.439]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[01:01:02.439 --> 01:01:03.559]  It's on record the U.S.
[01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:04.779]  has those systems.
[01:01:04.779 --> 01:01:10.680]  The point is it's called Mutually Assured Destruction or MAD for a reason.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.901]  Because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[01:01:14.947 --> 01:01:26.092]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war, especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us, and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia, when that was all a giant lie.
[01:01:26.092 --> 01:01:30.374]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[01:01:30.374 --> 01:01:33.836]  I want you to get up now.
[01:01:33.836 --> 01:01:35.897]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:47.572]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[01:01:47.572 --> 01:01:58.715]  I want you to get up right now, stick your head out of the window, open it, and stick your head out and keep yelling and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL, I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.135]  Just get up from your chairs, right now, go to the window!
[01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:02.995]  Where are you going?
[01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:04.156]  I don't want to see anybody yelling!
[01:02:04.156 --> 01:02:05.736]  Open it and stick your head out!
[01:02:17.858 --> 01:02:19.039]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.719]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:20.719 --> 01:02:22.280]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.541]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:24.782]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:24.782 --> 01:02:26.362]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:26.362 --> 01:02:27.503]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:27.503 --> 01:02:28.664]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:28.664 --> 01:02:29.984]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:29.984 --> 01:02:31.265]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:31.265 --> 01:02:33.286]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:33.286 --> 01:02:36.107]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:38.369]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:38.369 --> 01:02:40.710]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:59.002]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he let out.
[01:02:59.002 --> 01:03:02.263]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[01:03:02.263 --> 01:03:03.464]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[01:03:03.464 --> 01:03:09.146]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine.
[01:03:09.146 --> 01:03:12.427]  Feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[01:03:12.427 --> 01:03:16.048]  Paul holding on for dear life and a hollering at the top of his lungs.
[01:03:16.048 --> 01:03:17.689]  He says, the British is coming!
[01:03:17.689 --> 01:03:18.969]  The British is coming!
[01:03:18.969 --> 01:03:21.430]  Get your gun, we gonna have us a revolution!
[01:03:22.276 --> 01:03:26.859]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of a beehive.
[01:03:26.859 --> 01:03:28.240]  Minute men, they's called.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.481]  What's minute men?
[01:03:29.481 --> 01:03:30.582]  Minute men?
[01:03:30.582 --> 01:03:33.004]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[01:03:33.004 --> 01:03:41.410]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:48.675]  And when the British come a-prancing along all dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[01:03:48.675 --> 01:03:50.016]  It was a sight to see.
[01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.242]  And then it happened.
[01:03:53.242 --> 01:03:54.884]  They fired the gun!
[01:03:54.884 --> 01:03:56.885]  They fired the gun.
[01:03:56.885 --> 01:04:03.010]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.411]  Oh, get out!
[01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:07.814]  That's the way this country started.
[01:04:29.104 --> 01:04:36.069]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:38.711]  You better believe you got one!
[01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:45.236]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.844 --> 01:05:02.545]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:05:02.545 --> 01:05:07.426]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:05:07.426 --> 01:05:12.728]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:05:12.728 --> 01:05:22.751]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to MFORWARESTORE.COM and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.501]  A lot of you have never shopped at InfoWare Store.
[01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:50.844]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWare Store.
[01:05:50.844 --> 01:05:55.067]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.

[01:05:56.568 --> 01:05:59.390]  Go to InfoWareStore.com today and I thank you.
[01:06:04.426 --> 01:06:08.453]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:08.453 --> 01:06:16.405]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.904 --> 01:06:25.926]  Well, I've been following this guy for more than a decade.
[01:06:25.926 --> 01:06:27.086]  Such prolific work.
[01:06:27.086 --> 01:06:30.408]  And then I've tried to get the producers a few times to get him on, but it never happened.
[01:06:30.408 --> 01:06:32.789]  Turns out he lives in Dripping Springs.
[01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:35.530]  He was on with Mike Adams yesterday in the 4th Hour.
[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.511]  Michael Yawn is here.
[01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:50.538]  And, wow, to try to describe your whole background, the thousands of stories you broke, all over the world what you've done, from the war zones to the border, to hunting cannibals, just all of it is wild.
[01:06:51.298 --> 01:06:52.059]  Absolutely wild.
[01:06:52.059 --> 01:06:56.762]  You're on Twitter at Michael underscore Yon Y-O-N.
[01:06:56.762 --> 01:07:00.224]  And of course, michaelyon.locals.com.
[01:07:00.224 --> 01:07:03.086]  Great to have you here with us in the next two hours.
[01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:04.687]  I kind of want to just let you take it away.
[01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.369]  I mean, because you know so much.
[01:07:07.817 --> 01:07:09.620]  It's really an honor to come on your show.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:12.804]  It's amazing, actually.
[01:07:12.804 --> 01:07:21.777]  I've come to Texas because this is an epicenter of the action, not because people that know me know that wherever I go, you should probably go away from.
[01:07:23.479 --> 01:07:26.741]  I actually have an office in Thailand.
[01:07:26.741 --> 01:07:34.766]  And so, actually, when it comes to Information War, by the way, Info Wars, I've actually written three books on Information War, but they're all in Japanese, unfortunately.
[01:07:34.766 --> 01:07:35.787]  They're not in English.
[01:07:35.787 --> 01:07:43.692]  Because I've been trying to wake up the Japanese to the incredible Information War that they are undergoing.
[01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.914]  It's an Information War designed to split Korea
[01:07:46.574 --> 01:08:05.113]  and uh... in japan and the united states that trying that defense triangle and it's been pretty effective against korea and japan but in any case right i've been a war correspondent for years uh... and uh... mostly iraq for a couple years afghanistan for a couple of years off the philippines i was out with uh... malice in nepal and
[01:08:05.894 --> 01:08:06.614]  A lot of the fighting.
[01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:07.835]  Before that you were in the military.
[01:08:07.835 --> 01:08:10.977]  I was in special forces in the military, right.
[01:08:10.977 --> 01:08:18.761]  And so that gave me a good background for understanding a lot of the unconventional warfare that we see today.
[01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:23.684]  And for instance, I lived in Poland for a couple of years, lived in Germany for four years.
[01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:29.448]  And so I've spent six years and I've spent most of my time overseas.
[01:08:29.448 --> 01:08:32.971]  Most of my life has been overseas in about 90 countries.
[01:08:32.971 --> 01:08:36.374]  So although I'm American, I've lived all over the United States.
[01:08:36.374 --> 01:08:37.815]  I went to school in California.
[01:08:37.815 --> 01:08:45.061]  I grew up in Florida, stationed at Fort Bragg, of course, and Special Forces, and Bad Tolts, Germany, and that sort of thing.
[01:08:45.061 --> 01:08:46.022]  So I've been around.
[01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:46.902]  I've seen a few things.
[01:08:46.902 --> 01:08:48.364]  I've learned a few things.
[01:08:48.364 --> 01:08:51.466]  And now we see that we are in big trouble.
[01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:54.889]  And the highest level of warfare, of course, is information war, info wars.
[01:08:55.229 --> 01:09:02.095]  That was my first question before we hit all your great knowledge is how would you describe the state of the world in America right now?
[01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:04.877]  Problematic, to put it lightly.
[01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:13.864]  This morning when I woke up I called Mike Flynn, who's a big fan of your show by the way, and I told him I'm coming on with Alex today and we talked about this.
[01:09:13.864 --> 01:09:16.707]  I mean we are that close to a thermonuclear war.
[01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:17.708]  I mean it's obviously
[01:09:18.248 --> 01:09:18.868]  You get it.
[01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:22.090]  I watch you, Alex, you're talking about it all the time.
[01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:26.572]  We are amazingly close to a very serious, we're in a serious war right now.
[01:09:26.572 --> 01:09:32.815]  For instance, with CCP, the Chinese Communist Party has been at war with us for years.
[01:09:32.815 --> 01:09:40.619]  One only needs to read to Unrestricted Warfare to watch what China does.
[01:09:40.619 --> 01:09:42.980]  Of course, I got kicked out of Hong Kong in 2020.
[01:09:44.301 --> 01:09:50.912]  I was covering the resistance in Hong Kong for about seven months and they finally kicked me out.
[01:09:50.912 --> 01:09:55.939]  They should have kicked me out after about seven minutes, but you might have seen it in the news.
[01:09:55.939 --> 01:09:58.523]  But that was a huge information operation as well.
[01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:08.092]  And Hong Kong, one of the things that the Chinese Communist Party has done to destroy Hong Kong is weaponized immigration.
[01:10:08.092 --> 01:10:11.816]  So they've been bringing in mainlanders into Hong Kong for years.
[01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:16.520]  And they've been bringing in, on average, 100 to 150 a day for many years.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.221]  Now it's a larger number.
[01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:22.725]  And they're trying to force the Cantonese speakers there to speak Mandarin, not to speak Cantonese.
[01:10:23.826 --> 01:10:24.047]  Yeah.
[01:10:40.268 --> 01:10:42.749]  Same thing's done here with all the transgenderism.
[01:10:42.749 --> 01:10:43.629]  It's all a war on language.
[01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:01.257]  Language.
[01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.118]  Language is the high ground.
[01:11:03.118 --> 01:11:05.280]  As you know, you talk about it all the time.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.701]  You can't cede the language.
[01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:10.504]  The little words like vaccine, it's not a vaccine.
[01:11:10.504 --> 01:11:13.026]  You can't, or migration.
[01:11:13.026 --> 01:11:14.487]  We're being invaded, right?
[01:11:14.487 --> 01:11:15.708]  Europe is being invaded.
[01:11:15.708 --> 01:11:17.189]  These aren't migrants, this is an invasion.
[01:11:17.389 --> 01:11:18.690]  This is a straight up invasion.
[01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:51.112]  As a country has what I call a non-Newtonian personality.
[01:11:51.112 --> 01:11:54.194]  In other words, the harder you push them, the stronger they get.
[01:11:54.194 --> 01:11:55.055]  Like you.
[01:11:55.055 --> 01:11:58.337]  The harder you push Alex Jones, the stronger you get.
[01:11:58.337 --> 01:12:00.999]  I mean, you get punched and you get knocked down and you get back up.
[01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:01.880]  Poland's like that.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.043]  Poland, like the Germans, constantly push Poland.
[01:12:06.043 --> 01:12:07.824]  You have to take your fair share.
[01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.486]  Poland's not going to sit like that.
[01:12:09.966 --> 01:12:11.768]  So I flew up to the Lithuanians.
[01:12:11.768 --> 01:12:14.791]  I had a Lithuanian army in Afghanistan actually.
[01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:18.915]  So I kept my contacts there and from Morocco I called up some Lithuanians.
[01:12:18.915 --> 01:12:20.857]  I called up an army officer actually.
[01:12:20.857 --> 01:12:25.141]  I said, hey, what's up with Belarus pushing migrants into Lithuania?
[01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:26.162]  And he said, well, come on up.
[01:12:26.162 --> 01:12:27.723]  We just noticed you were in Morocco.
[01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:30.066]  So I flew to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.
[01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:33.487]  Got off the airplane, met with some top government officials.
[01:12:33.487 --> 01:12:41.208]  I got full access to the camps, including their intelligence people, their army, police, elected officials, and saw what's happening.
[01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:48.269]  And basically Belarus, with Russia behind it, is pushing the migrants, invaders, and they're from all over the world, all over Africa.
[01:12:48.269 --> 01:12:51.630]  Many of them were actually Syrians and Iraqis as well from the Middle East.
[01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:53.170]  Chechens, many Chechens.
[01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:54.330]  I asked them about Chechens.
[01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.430]  I said, do you have any Chechens?
[01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:57.951]  So it's not just the UN using migrants as a weapon?
[01:12:58.391 --> 01:12:59.392]  Oh no.
[01:12:59.392 --> 01:13:07.239]  But, however, and I told the Lithuanians, we had a little private conference there and I said, you know, you're going to get an ecosystem of people here.
[01:13:07.239 --> 01:13:12.783]  You're going to get the OIM, the IOM, depending on which language, the immigration,
[01:13:13.964 --> 01:13:16.905]  Pump, you might call it, that's also working in Darien Gap.
[01:13:16.905 --> 01:13:20.147]  You're going to get a Norwegian Refugee Council.
[01:13:20.147 --> 01:13:22.087]  You're going to get Catholic Charities.
[01:13:22.087 --> 01:13:29.710]  There's a little ecosystem of pumping stations that pumps these migrants from all over the world.
[01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:37.953]  For instance, through Darien Gap, where I just came in from Darien Gap, which is a huge jungle area between Colombia and Panama.
[01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:47.836]  And this is I've been going to Darien Gap ever since Biden seized or whoever put the meat puppet Biden into office.
[01:13:47.836 --> 01:13:51.397]  He's a dog king for those who know what dog kings are.
[01:13:51.397 --> 01:14:00.099]  And I knew that the Darien Gap was going to be a funnel or an hourglass from Asia and from Africa and from South America into
[01:14:00.819 --> 01:14:02.801]  Panama and up to the United States.
[01:14:02.801 --> 01:14:04.883]  Let me explain what the Darien Gap is.
[01:14:04.883 --> 01:14:10.048]  Highway 1 goes all the way from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America.
[01:14:10.048 --> 01:14:16.955]  You can ride on a motorcycle or a car and go all the way to Yavitza, Panama, and then there's about 63 miles with no roads.
[01:14:16.955 --> 01:14:19.277]  That's called the Gap, the Darien Gap.
[01:14:19.277 --> 01:14:21.199]  It's some pretty epic jungle.
[01:14:21.199 --> 01:14:25.062]  And that, the migrants will come up, or the invaders will come up from
[01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:32.047]  About 140 different countries, and they go to Colombia, and I've gone down there to Colombia, and I've started the Darién Gap on that side.
[01:14:32.047 --> 01:14:33.748]  I didn't walk all the way through.
[01:14:33.748 --> 01:14:39.291]  And they will start in Colombia, go through the Darién Gap, a huge number of them die.
[01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:45.235]  They walk over the Montaña de la Muerta, the Mountain of Death, and the three crossings where so many drowned.
[01:14:45.235 --> 01:14:50.138]  And then the Indians start killing them, the Kuna and the Imbara Indians, who I go out with all the time.
[01:14:50.138 --> 01:14:52.159]  That's who I go with, is with the Indians.
[01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:54.401]  And then finally they come out through the other side of the gap.
[01:14:54.881 --> 01:15:05.565]  And they're put on buses, and actually 39 died about a week ago in a bus accident with one of these buses that's coming up from the Darien Gap to Costa Rican border.
[01:15:05.565 --> 01:15:09.667]  And these are funded largely by the United States.
[01:15:09.667 --> 01:15:14.149]  For instance, Secretary Mayorkas was heading down... Well, that was my next point.
[01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.809]  We've got to go break.
[01:15:14.809 --> 01:15:19.871]  Guys, you get the clip, there's a bunch of them, but Biden's saying, if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:24.093]  There's no doubt that that call and then State Department funding is causing this.
[01:15:24.977 --> 01:15:26.477]  That's what you're saying?
[01:15:26.477 --> 01:15:26.838]  100%.
[01:15:26.838 --> 01:15:32.639]  In fact, I've stayed down in Darien Gap for months developing human sources and that sort of thing.
[01:15:32.639 --> 01:15:41.601]  You know, getting to know the Indians and the Imbara Indians and the Kuna Indians and many of the workers like Red Cross.
[01:15:41.601 --> 01:15:46.983]  And so there's actually a hotel right beside one of the camps in Darien Gap called San Vicente Camp.
[01:15:49.087 --> 01:15:50.390]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:51.333]  This is riveting stuff.

[01:16:50.128 --> 01:16:52.569]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.

[01:16:53.429 --> 01:16:55.170]  But now, I signed the last books.

[01:19:48.995 --> 01:19:49.435]  Get it now.
[01:20:00.037 --> 01:20:04.652]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.652 --> 01:20:05.976]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:20:16.704 --> 01:20:22.585]  Well, Michael Dion's a famous wartime correspondent, loved by the U.S.
[01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:32.187]  military, former Special Forces himself, and he's drilling into the, you know, 10-foot view or 5-foot view or 1-inch view about the Darien Gap and all the rest of it.
[01:20:32.187 --> 01:20:38.029]  I was asking him, give us the 35,000-foot view of the U.N., the NGOs, the State Department, the larger operation.
[01:20:38.029 --> 01:20:41.529]  I mean, inside, where these people are coming from.
[01:20:41.529 --> 01:20:43.810]  You're saying Chinese, Russians are pouring across as well.
[01:20:45.239 --> 01:20:46.439]  Oh, right, Chinese.
[01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:53.102]  In fact, a couple of weeks ago, or three weeks ago now, I was in the Darien Gap, two weeks ago, and I took two Chinese with me.
[01:20:53.102 --> 01:21:00.364]  I took a Cantonese speaker and I took a Mandarin speaker, because there's so many mainland Chinese coming through the Darien Gap.
[01:21:00.364 --> 01:21:05.806]  The mainland Chinese will fly to Ecuador first, and then they go through Colombia and they come through the Gap.
[01:21:05.806 --> 01:21:07.167]  And so I took those two speakers.
[01:21:07.167 --> 01:21:07.947]  And that's in Panama?
[01:21:09.147 --> 01:21:10.668]  They start on the Colombian side.
[01:21:10.668 --> 01:21:23.612]  They'll start at a place called Nicocli and they get on boats, which I've done, and then they'll go on the boats to a place called Coppergana and from there they'll either boat or there's two different main journeys to get into the Darien Gap at that point.
[01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:27.033]  The Chinese have more money so they take a more luxurious route.
[01:21:27.033 --> 01:21:31.455]  You might say it's still quite difficult and dangerous.
[01:21:31.455 --> 01:21:37.737]  The mainland Chinese will pay about $20,000 to get from mainland China into Panama itself.
[01:21:38.257 --> 01:21:39.578]  And so they've got money.
[01:21:39.578 --> 01:21:42.801]  And again, I took two Chinese down there with me recently.
[01:21:42.801 --> 01:21:44.562]  One spoke Cantonese, the other Mandarin.
[01:21:44.562 --> 01:21:48.705]  I took them down there because I wanted to see if any actually spoke Cantonese.
[01:21:48.705 --> 01:21:53.789]  None of the about 50 that we spoke with that were coming through, none spoke Cantonese.
[01:21:53.789 --> 01:21:55.430]  Everybody spoke Mandarin.
[01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:59.273]  Nobody was from like Malaysia or Indonesia or Taiwan.
[01:21:59.273 --> 01:22:01.214]  They were all from mainland China.
[01:22:01.214 --> 01:22:03.376]  And they're from many parts of mainland China.
[01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:04.577]  They were educated people.
[01:22:04.577 --> 01:22:05.017]  They were not
[01:22:06.058 --> 01:22:08.880]  They were not people running from the gulag or that sort of thing.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:14.165]  They were clearly educated people and some spoke English actually, none spoke German.
[01:22:14.165 --> 01:22:16.707]  I tried German on most of them.
[01:22:16.707 --> 01:22:21.011]  But they all said that they were coming up for jobs and that sort of thing.
[01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:24.514]  There were some family units, but mostly they were military age males.
[01:22:24.514 --> 01:22:26.976]  And some of them looked very military to me.
[01:22:27.256 --> 01:22:28.777]  They were very switched on.
[01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:29.697]  They were alert.
[01:22:29.697 --> 01:22:30.357]  They were fit.
[01:22:30.357 --> 01:22:34.459]  They weren't shuffling and looking at their feet, walking through.
[01:22:34.459 --> 01:22:41.262]  They were really looking around, checking everything out, and leery of the cameras and that sort of thing.
[01:22:41.262 --> 01:22:44.224]  But I still got a lot of video of these.
[01:22:44.224 --> 01:22:50.026]  Most of the people coming across our border are military-age males from whatever country, whether that's Haitians or whatever.
[01:22:50.026 --> 01:22:51.047]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:52.810]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:57.572]  You know, all over Europe, for instance, I was just down in Dominican Republic as well.
[01:22:57.572 --> 01:23:01.355]  Dominican Republic is building a border with Haiti.
[01:23:01.355 --> 01:23:05.197]  And should I look at you or the camera, by the way?
[01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:05.857]  This way.
[01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:06.177]  All right.
[01:23:06.177 --> 01:23:10.420]  So the Dominican Republic shares the island with Haiti, of course.
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:15.003]  About one third of the island is Haiti, and the other two thirds are Dominican Republic.
[01:23:15.003 --> 01:23:17.584]  And they are building a wall there, which they call their Trump Wall.
[01:23:17.584 --> 01:23:18.845]  I was just down on that wall.
[01:23:19.385 --> 01:23:20.126]  Thank you.
[01:23:37.438 --> 01:23:39.540]  Huge amounts of Haitians are coming through.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.561]  So, Haitians are one of the larger groups.
[01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:44.423]  They do a huge amount of criminality, actually.
[01:23:44.423 --> 01:23:49.687]  Whether it's Colombia or Panama or Mexico, everybody's wary of the Haitians.
[01:23:49.687 --> 01:23:51.828]  Not Africans, but Haitians specifically.
[01:23:51.828 --> 01:23:53.990]  And why does Colombia let them land there?
[01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:55.451]  Like, why don't they just go directly to Mexico?
[01:23:56.933 --> 01:24:10.236]  Interestingly, when I was in Colombia about two years ago, there was actually a CNN on the big screen at the hotel and the restaurant in Spanish showing people how to get through the dairying gap.
[01:24:10.236 --> 01:24:16.257]  It was showing migrants, if you want to call them that, how to get to various countries through Colombia into the dairying gap.
[01:24:16.257 --> 01:24:18.778]  Colombia is just making money off of them.
[01:24:18.778 --> 01:24:20.358]  For instance, they make a lot of money.
[01:24:20.538 --> 01:24:23.760]  I mean right now about a thousand per day are coming through, right?
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:32.406]  And so all of these people pay a lot of money to, whether it's the boat men or the taxi drivers or whatever.
[01:24:32.406 --> 01:24:35.488]  And so there's a lot of money flows into the country that way.
[01:24:35.488 --> 01:24:37.370]  And you said the State Department's helping this happen?
[01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.151]  Absolutely.
[01:24:39.151 --> 01:24:43.872]  Well, Secretary Mayorkas flew down there about last April.
[01:24:43.872 --> 01:24:49.275]  I got word from a congressman, actually, that I was about to fly to Arizona to go with some congressmen on the border.
[01:24:49.275 --> 01:24:53.636]  And one told me that Mayorkas was about to fly to Panama.
[01:24:53.636 --> 01:24:56.437]  I said, well, if he's coming to Panama, I bet he'll go to Darien Gap.
[01:24:56.437 --> 01:25:04.501]  So I went down there and I stationed myself and I waited for about three to four days in a place where I thought he might land in helicopters, which he did.
[01:25:04.501 --> 01:25:05.861]  He landed in three Black Hawks.
[01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:07.022]  I launched my drone and
[01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:10.845]  So they're expanding these camps all over the place?
[01:25:31.966 --> 01:25:38.487]  They're expanding the camps in size and also the operation is much smoother now.
[01:25:38.487 --> 01:25:48.549]  In other words, before, the migrants, again, if you want to call them that, euphemistically called migrants, would come and they might spend days or even weeks in the camps.
[01:25:48.549 --> 01:25:50.150]  Now they can spend hours.
[01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:57.151]  So once you come through the Darien Gap now, you're immediately getting put into a bus.
[01:25:57.151 --> 01:26:00.652]  And again, just about a week ago, a bus had an accident, killed 39 of them.
[01:26:01.872 --> 01:26:04.874]  So they'll go to two different camps.
[01:26:04.874 --> 01:26:08.176]  As you come through Darien Gap, you'll feed into two different villages.
[01:26:08.176 --> 01:26:13.319]  One is called Canaan Membrillo, right?
[01:26:13.319 --> 01:26:14.900]  It's on the Membrillo River.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:17.942]  And that's about three hours up by a dugout canoe.
[01:26:17.942 --> 01:26:20.763]  It's like Apocalypse Now stuff up into the jungle.
[01:26:21.884 --> 01:26:26.486]  And then there's another Imbara Indian Village, also about three hours up into the jungle.
[01:26:26.486 --> 01:26:29.507]  So I've been to both of these more than a dozen times.
[01:26:29.507 --> 01:26:33.309]  And this is where they will feed out into is these two villages, right?
[01:26:33.309 --> 01:26:39.212]  And once you get to one of these villages, then you'll stay overnight or so, and then you'll get put on a dugout canoe.
[01:26:39.212 --> 01:26:40.892]  That's the only canoes out in these rivers.
[01:26:40.892 --> 01:26:42.373]  There's crocodiles and all.
[01:26:42.373 --> 01:26:43.674]  You're way out there, right?
[01:26:43.674 --> 01:26:47.075]  And so then you come down about three hours on the river.
[01:26:47.075 --> 01:26:48.516]  You get put on deuce and a halves.
[01:26:49.196 --> 01:27:14.042]  uh... they're operated by senate front which is like the uh... panamanian border patrol police they're highly professional by the way and actually has uh... senate front special forces team just help me get through to journalists and uh... about uh... just a few it was uh... a month ago or so it was uh... two journalists came through and and went on ban and show actually when they make it and so i i i hope them get through and senate front actually helped us listen to front within shuttle the the migrants into
[01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:17.625]  The two camps, Las Blancas or San Vicente.
[01:27:17.625 --> 01:27:22.228]  At Las Blancas and San Vicente, for instance, I was in Las Blancas a few weeks ago.
[01:27:22.228 --> 01:27:29.515]  As soon as you get off the dugout canoe, there's somebody standing there with a map, which he's got folded out, and it's showing you where to go.
[01:27:29.515 --> 01:27:39.403]  And you can take the QR code and make a QR code that'll show you the map, where to go, all the migrants, where all the stops are up in Panama.
[01:27:39.403 --> 01:27:43.046]  So Western governments, Europe and the US, are creating pipelines with third world populations?
[01:27:43.406 --> 01:27:45.808]  It's a complete pipeline with pumping stations.
[01:27:45.808 --> 01:27:46.528]  You should see this.
[01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:48.049]  I'll give it to you when I leave.
[01:27:48.049 --> 01:27:49.350]  And so you can have the QR.
[01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:51.031]  You can see the map yourself.
[01:27:51.031 --> 01:27:52.792]  And so we have pipelines.
[01:27:52.792 --> 01:27:56.635]  And at this Las Blancas camp, there's actually a nursery tent there.
[01:27:56.635 --> 01:28:02.278]  There's a legal tent there giving you legal advice, how to talk when you get to the U.S.
[01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:04.500]  border, you know, the things that you have to say.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:08.162]  And the same thing was done 10 years ago, starting in Europe, creating those pipelines.
[01:28:08.562 --> 01:28:09.503]  Absolutely.
[01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:14.366]  And you know, the Europeans have been a naive population to this, especially, for instance, the Swedes.
[01:28:14.366 --> 01:28:15.846]  I was in Luxembourg last year.
[01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:17.627]  I spent about a week there in Luxembourg.
[01:28:17.627 --> 01:28:21.190]  The last time I was in Luxembourg was when I was in the army, right?
[01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:22.710]  And it was the jewel of Europe.
[01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:24.251]  It was a beautiful place.
[01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:27.473]  Now it's about, literally about 50% migrants.
[01:28:27.473 --> 01:28:28.874]  And you can see that on their official website.
[01:28:28.874 --> 01:28:30.175]  Just sleeping on the street everywhere.
[01:28:30.175 --> 01:28:32.476]  Yeah, that's not a number that came out of my head.
[01:28:32.476 --> 01:28:34.257]  You can see that on their official website.
[01:28:34.257 --> 01:28:34.598]  I think it was 48%.
[01:28:35.738 --> 01:28:36.058]  Stay there.
[01:28:36.058 --> 01:28:37.199]  I want to talk about big picture with us.
[01:28:37.199 --> 01:28:42.823]  I'm going to shift gears to Ukraine war, to information warfare, to the new world order, to Biden.
[01:28:42.823 --> 01:28:43.643]  Just big picture.
[01:28:43.643 --> 01:28:44.344]  You're a smart guy.
[01:28:44.344 --> 01:28:52.729]  How you would describe the world today and where you think we're going and what you think we can do to avert this engineered UN world crisis.
[01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:54.671]  We'll be right back with our special guest in studio.
[01:29:01.224 --> 01:29:07.608]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:09.369]  World War III has already started.
[01:29:09.369 --> 01:29:11.671]  Biden is a puppet who's dissolving our borders.
[01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:12.831]  There's mass censorship.
[01:29:12.831 --> 01:29:15.053]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:29:15.053 --> 01:29:17.314]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:29:17.314 --> 01:29:21.797]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:25.899]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[01:29:25.899 --> 01:29:34.304]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.

[01:31:00.362 --> 01:31:03.484]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:31:03.484 --> 01:31:05.765]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:31:05.765 --> 01:31:09.708]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:31:09.708 --> 01:31:17.793]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:17.793 --> 01:31:26.419]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:31:27.449 --> 01:31:31.093]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:31.093 --> 01:31:36.879]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:31:36.879 --> 01:31:39.342]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:31:39.342 --> 01:31:39.923]  Keep doing it.
[01:31:39.923 --> 01:31:46.970]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:48.152]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:31:48.832 --> 01:31:53.134]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:31:53.134 --> 01:31:58.096]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarshore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.137]  Please take action now.
[01:31:59.137 --> 01:32:05.299]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[01:32:05.299 --> 01:32:08.021]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:08.921]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:32:09.301 --> 01:32:13.202]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:32:13.202 --> 01:32:18.383]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:32:18.383 --> 01:32:24.565]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:32:24.565 --> 01:32:30.286]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and I would probably not even be
[01:32:30.706 --> 01:32:33.227]  Half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:32:33.227 --> 01:32:38.889]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:32:38.889 --> 01:32:47.052]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:32:47.052 --> 01:32:49.752]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:32:49.752 --> 01:32:53.914]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support InfoWars.
[01:32:53.914 --> 01:32:55.274]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:32:55.274 --> 01:32:56.755]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:32:59.781 --> 01:33:12.269]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.269 --> 01:33:20.015]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.641]  Michael Yahn is our guest.
[01:33:23.641 --> 01:33:25.061]  Famous investigative journalist.
[01:33:25.061 --> 01:33:27.062]  War zones around the world.
[01:33:27.062 --> 01:33:29.822]  He's focusing on the collapsed border by design.
[01:33:29.822 --> 01:33:32.463]  It's the real war zone in Europe and the United States.
[01:33:32.463 --> 01:33:34.864]  The replacement migration, the UN plan.
[01:33:34.864 --> 01:33:39.045]  So give us the high-level overview of what you think's happening here.
[01:33:39.045 --> 01:33:44.827]  And since I mentioned it, here's that clip of Biden when he was a candidate saying, if I win, immediately surge the border.
[01:33:45.782 --> 01:33:50.426]  Well, I would do, as president, several more things, because things have changed.
[01:33:50.426 --> 01:33:55.471]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:33:55.471 --> 01:33:57.373]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:33:57.373 --> 01:33:58.354]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:33:58.354 --> 01:33:59.555]  That's who we are.
[01:33:59.555 --> 01:34:04.840]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.321]  Sorry, I asked you a question and played a clip.
[01:34:06.321 --> 01:34:07.762]  That's my fault.
[01:34:07.762 --> 01:34:08.363]  Michael, start over.
[01:34:09.684 --> 01:34:12.906]  Well, there's a demographic destruction ongoing here.
[01:34:12.906 --> 01:34:14.367]  It's a replacement strategy.
[01:34:14.367 --> 01:34:17.569]  Of course, when you say that, people say that's conspiratorial, but they say that.
[01:34:17.569 --> 01:34:19.150]  That's clearly what they're doing.
[01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:22.712]  That's what Stalin did in 32 and 33 with the Holodomor, right?
[01:34:22.712 --> 01:34:25.554]  With the kulaks, kulakization, right?
[01:34:25.554 --> 01:34:28.736]  It's the same old strategy that Mao used as well.
[01:34:28.736 --> 01:34:35.601]  Of course, Mao looked up to Stalin for a lot of his hints on how to do... And so now the big corporations are using Maoist technology.
[01:34:36.241 --> 01:34:36.822]  Malice control.
[01:34:53.399 --> 01:35:00.083]  I've done the kinetics, I've done all the firefights for many years and that sort of thing and the bombs and the ambushes and that sort of thing.
[01:35:00.083 --> 01:35:02.905]  That's kind of a lower level of warfare.
[01:35:02.905 --> 01:35:07.448]  The highest level of warfare is the PhD level is information warfare, right?
[01:35:07.448 --> 01:35:09.290]  But underneath this are so many other things.
[01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:11.891]  For instance, food supply, energy of course.
[01:35:13.412 --> 01:35:16.074]  And the food supply is obviously crucial.
[01:35:16.074 --> 01:35:19.197]  Whoever controls the food and the energy and the money.
[01:35:19.197 --> 01:35:21.879]  So I've been studying the food issues for quite a while.
[01:35:21.879 --> 01:35:26.562]  And in January of 2020, I started warning about potential famine.
[01:35:26.562 --> 01:35:29.965]  And you've never heard me warn about that before as a war correspondent.
[01:35:29.965 --> 01:35:32.527]  I would always just say, be prepared, that sort of thing.
[01:35:32.527 --> 01:35:36.010]  But I didn't say, now become a prepper, right?
[01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:37.411]  And now at this point, if you're not
[01:35:37.751 --> 01:35:40.934]  Prepping, you're somewhat foolish, actually.
[01:35:40.934 --> 01:35:44.016]  I hate to use that term, but let's just be realistic.
[01:35:44.016 --> 01:35:46.318]  You know, and it's all about conditions, by the way.
[01:35:46.318 --> 01:35:52.403]  When I talk about famine, when I say what I'm going to say next, oftentimes people say, well, what will be the spark?
[01:35:52.403 --> 01:35:53.864]  What will be the spark of a war?
[01:35:53.864 --> 01:35:54.885]  What will be this?
[01:35:54.885 --> 01:35:55.946]  It's not about sparks.
[01:35:55.946 --> 01:35:58.708]  Sparks is kind of an amateur level of looking at things.
[01:35:58.708 --> 01:36:00.330]  It's all about conditions.
[01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:02.892]  Like a forest fire, like when I'm down in the dairying gap,
[01:36:03.532 --> 01:36:04.873]  In the jungle, it's a rainforest.
[01:36:04.873 --> 01:36:07.513]  You could have a firework factory blow up in the Darien Gap.
[01:36:07.513 --> 01:36:11.735]  It would leave a smoking crater and it might burn for a few hours and it's going to go out.
[01:36:11.735 --> 01:36:15.075]  Conditions are not right for a jungle fire in the Darien Gap.
[01:36:15.075 --> 01:36:21.457]  But if you have, you know, California where they leave the fuel load under the dry trees and that sort of thing, anything will do.
[01:36:21.457 --> 01:36:24.698]  A little spark, a cigarette, whatever, and the whole town's burn up.
[01:36:24.698 --> 01:36:26.399]  It's the same way with famine.
[01:36:26.399 --> 01:36:29.200]  Famines can happen suddenly or they can happen slowly.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.380]  They can happen suddenly with
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:33.623]  For instance, a volcanic eruption.
[01:36:33.623 --> 01:36:41.892]  Japan has probably had maybe more than 500 famines in the last 1,500 years, and three of the biggest ones started with volcanoes, right?
[01:36:41.892 --> 01:36:47.398]  But there's also the slow-moving famines, which are often intentional.
[01:36:47.398 --> 01:36:50.521]  Oftentimes, like for instance, the Irish Famine, 1845 to arguably 1852, depending on
[01:36:53.584 --> 01:36:54.405]  Who you want to argue with?
[01:37:23.925 --> 01:37:32.476]  So food is a weapon and the system, the bureaucrats, the corporations are setting up an atmosphere, an environment for worldwide famine.
[01:37:33.012 --> 01:37:33.552]  Right.
[01:37:33.552 --> 01:37:36.853]  And this drives the next part of the warfare.
[01:37:36.853 --> 01:37:37.473]  HOP.
[01:37:37.473 --> 01:37:39.253]  Human Osmotic Pressure.
[01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:43.034]  The human osmotic pressure is the push and the pull of migration.
[01:37:43.034 --> 01:37:43.614]  Right?
[01:37:43.614 --> 01:37:49.736]  Now the globalists have been saying for years that they want to displace about 1.2 billion people in this.
[01:37:49.736 --> 01:37:52.396]  And of course, Lara Logan has given me an earful of this.
[01:37:52.396 --> 01:37:53.456]  You know how Lara is.
[01:37:53.456 --> 01:37:55.157]  Michael, are you paying attention to me?
[01:37:55.157 --> 01:37:56.777]  That sort of thing.
[01:37:56.777 --> 01:37:57.457]  1.2 billion people.
[01:37:57.457 --> 01:37:59.978]  Well, the UN plan says about 2050, 600 plus million in the US alone.
[01:38:02.273 --> 01:38:02.573]  How many?
[01:38:02.573 --> 01:38:04.054]  600 million they want to bring here.
[01:38:04.054 --> 01:38:05.474]  Yeah.
[01:38:05.474 --> 01:38:10.675]  And you'll see clowns like Peter Zahn saying, yo, we've got plenty of room, right?
[01:38:10.675 --> 01:38:21.299]  Bottom line is this hot, this human osmotic pressure always, which human osmotic pressure is driven by things like, well, it can be just a soft pressure economic wise, like the draw and the push.
[01:38:21.299 --> 01:38:26.720]  Let's say if you're living in Mexico, you might want to work in the United States and live back in Mexico actually, right?
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.481]  Many Mexicans still do that and Americans do likewise, right?
[01:38:30.201 --> 01:38:34.566]  And then there's the hard pressures, like pandemic, famine, and war, which is like a fire.
[01:38:34.566 --> 01:38:36.448]  You're going to run from the fire, right?
[01:38:36.448 --> 01:38:46.218]  And so, interestingly, pandemic and famine and war, the more of these things, if you're going to get into the higher levels of studying warfare, first of all, you must study information war, period.
[01:38:46.778 --> 01:38:47.259]  I don't think so.
[01:39:06.658 --> 01:39:07.138]  That's right.
[01:39:07.138 --> 01:39:08.159]  It's the triangle of death.
[01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:16.225]  I was saying this on an interview a couple of years ago, and one of my kind readers, she said, you know, you say pan for war, pandemic, famine, war, as if you made it up.
[01:39:16.225 --> 01:39:16.905]  And I said, I did.
[01:39:16.905 --> 01:39:18.727]  And she goes, no, it's in the Bible.
[01:39:18.727 --> 01:39:20.108]  I said, actually, you're right.
[01:39:20.108 --> 01:39:21.208]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:39:21.208 --> 01:39:23.230]  That's probably actually where I got it from.
[01:39:23.230 --> 01:39:24.791]  The Four Horsemen, the fourth one.
[01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:31.135]  So why are powerful infrastructure groups, why are powerful corporations pushing a climate of war and famine?
[01:39:32.356 --> 01:39:34.258]  Something you talk about all the time.
[01:39:34.258 --> 01:39:35.559]  World domination.
[01:39:35.559 --> 01:39:38.762]  They clearly want to reduce the world population, for starters.
[01:39:38.762 --> 01:39:51.193]  And this is an off-stated goal to even as low as 500 million people, which would obviously, so if they're going to bring 600 million in here, it's just for a Kulakization move, basically to kill us, right?
[01:39:51.193 --> 01:39:53.515]  And to take our property, which is very easy to do.
[01:39:53.515 --> 01:39:57.178]  You can just tell the Haitians and the others, hey, go take those white people's property.
[01:39:57.398 --> 01:40:03.406]  How many places in Africa- And that's the left, just like South Africa is priming anti-white race war.
[01:40:03.406 --> 01:40:04.548]  Absolutely.
[01:40:04.548 --> 01:40:08.653]  I mean, and that's the- So South Africa was a beta test.
[01:40:08.653 --> 01:40:10.415]  And some other African countries as well.
[01:40:10.415 --> 01:40:12.098]  And that's just the, that's just-
[01:40:13.427 --> 01:40:17.188]  The information war component is obviously part and parcel to everything.
[01:40:17.188 --> 01:40:19.109]  That's the stuff in the clouds.
[01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:20.850]  That's the whole thing, right?
[01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:23.631]  And so that's what Stalin did with the Kulakization.
[01:40:23.631 --> 01:40:29.193]  First he labeled everybody Kulaks, or Jews, Jews, or Poles had to wear the P for Polish, right?
[01:40:29.193 --> 01:40:35.455]  And so, first of all, you label your enemy, you mark your enemy, and then you say, hey, they stole your stuff.
[01:40:35.455 --> 01:40:36.996]  Go take it from them and it's yours.
[01:40:37.696 --> 01:40:46.539]  Remember two years ago, Facebook put out an update with 12 people, myself and a few others, and said, these groups you're allowed to call for violence against.
[01:40:46.539 --> 01:40:51.101]  And people couldn't believe they did that, but they actually posted that as their official rule, so they're beta testing that.
[01:40:51.101 --> 01:40:54.142]  They called for violence against you, openly?
[01:40:54.142 --> 01:41:00.625]  They said, you are not allowed to say anything positive about these 12 people, myself, Paul Watson, Gavin McGinnis, a few others.
[01:41:01.565 --> 01:41:04.387]  And you are allowed to call for violence against them.
[01:41:04.387 --> 01:41:04.948]  I swear to God.
[01:41:04.948 --> 01:41:05.648]  Does it sound real?
[01:41:05.648 --> 01:41:07.089]  You can pull it up.
[01:41:07.089 --> 01:41:09.371]  It's real.
[01:41:09.371 --> 01:41:10.932]  That's stunning.
[01:41:10.932 --> 01:41:14.495]  I mean, they're literally trying to call a hit squad in on you.
[01:41:14.495 --> 01:41:16.196]  That's quite obvious.
[01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:18.838]  But I think they were just beta testing to see if they get away with it.
[01:41:18.838 --> 01:41:21.140]  They pulled it in two days.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:21.260]  Hmm.
[01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:24.317]  Information War.
[01:41:24.317 --> 01:41:28.538]  You know, let's talk, just for a minute, do you mind if I go off on a tangent about dog kings?
[01:41:28.538 --> 01:41:29.258]  Dog king.
[01:41:29.258 --> 01:41:34.500]  A dog king is an old strategy in information war to demoralize your enemies.
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:39.561]  For instance, when the Swedish would kill a Norwegian king, they would make a literal dog into a king.
[01:41:39.561 --> 01:41:41.881]  Like, you know, with a crown and everything.
[01:41:41.881 --> 01:41:45.362]  And so the dog would have a translator and the dog's body language would...
[01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:47.844]  Give orders, right?
[01:41:47.844 --> 01:41:49.126]  That's why they called him Dog Kings.
[01:41:49.126 --> 01:41:51.469]  It was also done in Ethiopia and other places, right?
[01:41:51.469 --> 01:41:53.071]  So this had been done for centuries.
[01:41:53.071 --> 01:41:57.656]  Caligula's horse, you know, whether he actually made a horse a senator, I don't know.
[01:41:57.656 --> 01:42:03.543]  Or King Rama X in Thailand made his poodle Fufu into a vice air marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force.
[01:42:03.543 --> 01:42:03.844]  He didn't...
[01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:11.187]  He had some problems with the Air Force, so he made his poodle into actually a Vice Air Marshal to demoralize the Air Force.
[01:42:11.187 --> 01:42:20.372]  So you see that's what's happening when you've got braindead Fetterman up in Pennsylvania, or you've got Biden who's clearly a dog king, you've got Harris clearly a dog king.
[01:42:20.452 --> 01:42:24.334]  Drag queen story times, critical race theory, it's to purge the military.
[01:42:24.334 --> 01:42:26.015]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:36.540]  So you've got all these dog kings that demoralizes the people who don't do anything about it, who don't literally, you talk to posh toon people in Afghanistan, they'll tell you what they would do.
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:41.962]  I've talked to them, they would, anyway, I'll get put in jail if I say what the posh toon would say.
[01:42:41.962 --> 01:42:45.244]  Stay there, I'll talk about dog kings when we come back, this is riveting stuff.
[01:42:45.244 --> 01:42:47.005]  You famously tracked cannibals and caught them.
[01:42:47.745 --> 01:42:48.626]  Oh, that was epic.
[01:42:48.626 --> 01:42:50.950]  You know, I was taking a... Well, stay there.
[01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:51.811]  Stay there.
[01:42:51.811 --> 01:42:54.815]  In fact, let's come in with a clip of I'll Eat My Neighbors straight ahead.
[01:42:54.815 --> 01:42:55.676]  What an amazing guest.
[01:42:55.676 --> 01:42:57.880]  And we'll give your website out as well when we come back.
[01:42:59.138 --> 01:43:05.522]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:43:05.522 --> 01:43:10.145]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:43:10.145 --> 01:43:12.946]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[01:43:12.946 --> 01:43:15.188]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[01:43:15.188 --> 01:43:21.952]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[01:43:21.952 --> 01:43:25.314]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:43:25.954 --> 01:43:36.625]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWarsMD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:36.625 --> 01:43:41.871]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:41.871 --> 01:43:47.277]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's joint care, or whether it is super greens, we have them all.
[01:43:47.577 --> 01:43:54.459]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[01:44:08.263 --> 01:44:11.808]  Rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[01:44:11.808 --> 01:44:15.813]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[01:44:15.813 --> 01:44:18.136]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[01:44:18.136 --> 01:44:22.542]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[01:44:22.542 --> 01:44:25.005]  Because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[01:44:25.686 --> 01:44:34.516]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:44:34.516 --> 01:44:40.203]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:44:40.683 --> 01:44:42.645]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:44:42.645 --> 01:44:49.911]  If you decide to go to Infowarsstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:44:49.911 --> 01:44:51.332]  It is all in your hands.
[01:44:51.332 --> 01:44:52.653]  So thanks for your support.
[01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:53.875]  Stand up against the globalists.
[01:44:53.875 --> 01:44:57.137]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and keep us on air.
[01:44:57.137 --> 01:44:57.618]  It's up to you.
[01:45:00.714 --> 01:45:06.059]  Silver Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:45:06.059 --> 01:45:13.345]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:45:13.345 --> 01:45:16.888]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:45:16.888 --> 01:45:25.436]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:45:26.236 --> 01:45:34.144]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[01:45:34.144 --> 01:45:44.573]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:45:44.573 --> 01:45:47.516]  You will then be my slaves, my owners.
[01:45:48.076 --> 01:45:52.103]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:45:52.103 --> 01:45:58.973]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:45:58.973 --> 01:46:00.696]  The cavalry has arrived.
[01:46:01.511 --> 01:46:14.923]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.
[01:46:14.923 --> 01:46:17.205]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:46:17.205 --> 01:46:22.270]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and
[01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:26.314]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[01:46:33.542 --> 01:46:37.066]  If you've not experienced bone broth, even the regular ones have great effects.

[01:47:00.703 --> 01:47:06.628]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:11.729 --> 01:47:18.896]  I shot the sheriff But I swear it wasn't self-defense
[01:47:21.826 --> 01:47:23.268]  I will eat my neighbors.
[01:47:23.268 --> 01:47:24.549]  I'm not letting my kids die.
[01:47:24.549 --> 01:47:25.891]  I'm just gonna be honest.
[01:47:25.891 --> 01:47:27.633]  My superpower is being honest.
[01:47:27.633 --> 01:47:37.864]  I've extrapolated this out, and I won't have to for a few years since I got food and stuff, but I'm literally looking at my neighbors now and going, I'm ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up.
[01:47:37.864 --> 01:47:38.224]  You know what?
[01:47:38.224 --> 01:47:38.785]  I'm ready.
[01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:40.407]  My daughters aren't starving to death.
[01:47:40.407 --> 01:47:41.828]  I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:47:41.828 --> 01:47:41.969]  See?
[01:47:43.188 --> 01:47:44.649]  My superpower is being honest.
[01:47:44.649 --> 01:47:45.871]  I'll eat your ass.
[01:47:45.871 --> 01:47:46.892]  Okay, so that's good.
[01:47:46.892 --> 01:47:48.794]  And I said that was satire.
[01:47:48.794 --> 01:47:49.554]  The media ran with it.
[01:47:49.554 --> 01:47:57.923]  But if they continue to collapse society, you cover what's happening with the Dutch farmers everywhere else, the deliberate Canada making them dump millions of gallons a month of milk.
[01:47:57.923 --> 01:48:03.188]  I mean, this is a deliberate scarcity program by the ruling class of the planet.
[01:48:03.188 --> 01:48:04.289]  You're an expert on that.
[01:48:04.289 --> 01:48:05.730]  I mean, describe what you're seeing happening.
[01:48:06.551 --> 01:48:09.213]  Right, that's why I'm carrying this red handkerchief.
[01:48:09.213 --> 01:48:11.214]  All the Dutch people know what this is.
[01:48:11.214 --> 01:48:14.717]  That's the symbol of the resistance in Netherlands.
[01:48:14.717 --> 01:48:20.040]  The WEF, the World Economic Forum, they call it the WEF in Netherlands, is working to take their farms.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.902]  And right now they're trying to take another 3,000.
[01:48:21.902 --> 01:48:22.762]  There's 52,000 farms in Netherlands.
[01:48:22.762 --> 01:48:23.463]  They own about 62%.
[01:48:23.463 --> 01:48:24.363]  Farmers own about 62% of the land.
[01:48:24.363 --> 01:48:24.603]  And they're
[01:48:29.867 --> 01:48:31.290]  Trying to take complete control.
[01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:36.523]  And they've appointed the minister doing it to be the head UN guy running it worldwide.
[01:48:36.523 --> 01:48:37.505]  It's so predatory.
[01:48:37.505 --> 01:48:38.447]  It's so illegal.
[01:48:39.645 --> 01:48:39.965]  It is.
[01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:40.986]  It's highly predatory.
[01:48:40.986 --> 01:48:48.031]  In fact, when I leave you, I'm flying back to Netherlands because I'm going back on with Jordan Peterson over there.
[01:48:48.031 --> 01:48:48.892]  He went over with me.
[01:48:48.892 --> 01:48:54.616]  I took him to a farm and to meet other people over there to see the situation.
[01:48:54.616 --> 01:48:56.738]  It's a clear war on food.
[01:48:56.738 --> 01:48:58.099]  It's not just a war on farmers.
[01:48:58.099 --> 01:49:00.841]  It's a war on food to reduce the number of people.
[01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:07.826]  And they're doing epic information war in Netherlands to persuade the Dutch people that the farmers are bad.
[01:49:08.346 --> 01:49:15.655]  And so, in Netherlands they blame the stikstoff pollution, which in Dutch language means nitrogen.
[01:49:15.655 --> 01:49:24.645]  And next door in Germany, of course Netherlands borders Germany, in Germany it's the carbon dioxide, but in Netherlands it's stikstoff.
[01:49:24.645 --> 01:49:26.648]  Everything stikstoff is poison, they say.
[01:49:28.911 --> 01:49:30.813]  Even though humans put off that.
[01:49:30.813 --> 01:49:49.669]  Oh yeah, and well the nitrogen, I mean the nitrogen fertilizers, nitrogenous fertilizers like ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, all these sorts of things, you know the Haber-Bosch process which was first described in the thermodynamics book in 1903 by a guy named Fritz Haber, a German chemist, he described the idea of taking the hydrogen off of
[01:49:50.249 --> 01:49:50.550]  All right.
[01:50:11.112 --> 01:50:16.496]  They started working on this at Ludwigshafen, Germany at BASF plant, where I went to twice last year.
[01:50:16.496 --> 01:50:19.758]  And by 1915, they were doing it on an industrial scale.
[01:50:19.758 --> 01:50:29.664]  They were making ammonia at an industrial scale at Ludwigshafen on the Rhine River at BASF plant, which they could make a lot of explosives with that and fertilizers.
[01:50:29.664 --> 01:50:34.828]  And now you'll see at that time, that's when the global population began to really explode.
[01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:39.751]  Literally, and ammonia began to explode as well, because, you know, the same process.
[01:50:41.512 --> 01:50:43.514]  They're cutting off carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[01:50:43.514 --> 01:50:45.476]  They're trying to cut off nitrogen.
[01:50:45.476 --> 01:50:47.558]  I mean, this is a direct attack.
[01:50:47.558 --> 01:50:48.098]  Absolutely.
[01:50:48.098 --> 01:50:57.106]  Before that, actually, we were using bird guano and bat guano for fertilizers, which actually is what is believed to have led to the Irish potato blight.
[01:50:57.106 --> 01:51:03.591]  There may have been a fungus in the bird guano that was used for fertilizer for the Irish lumper potatoes.
[01:51:03.591 --> 01:51:05.633]  Anyway, separate story.
[01:51:05.633 --> 01:51:08.576]  And so right now, they're clearly, for instance,
[01:51:09.036 --> 01:51:17.499]  When Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 were blown up, Nord Stream 1, Nord Stream 2, when those things just got cut, that was it.
[01:51:17.499 --> 01:51:24.501]  I mean, I had been warning for much of last year, if BASF closes, that's Europe having a heart attack.
[01:51:24.501 --> 01:51:26.501]  And Mike Adams was warning about the same thing.
[01:51:26.501 --> 01:51:28.322]  So the fertilizer's being cut off?
[01:51:28.542 --> 01:51:31.103]  Oh yeah, because you need that natural gas.
[01:51:31.103 --> 01:51:33.164]  It doesn't matter how much electricity you have.
[01:51:33.164 --> 01:51:38.306]  You can't make the ammonia, the nitrogenous fertilizers with electricity.
[01:51:38.306 --> 01:51:42.647]  You have to have the natural gas, or in China they'll use coal gas.
[01:51:42.647 --> 01:51:44.088]  But you're not going to make it with electricity.
[01:51:44.548 --> 01:51:45.829]  Nuclear power plants, right?
[01:51:45.829 --> 01:51:54.774]  You're just not going to... So last year, I had a dinner with a retired CEO of a Dutch chemical company and Jordan Peterson.
[01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:57.435]  I arranged the dinner actually in Amsterdam.
[01:51:57.435 --> 01:51:58.556]  And his name is Hank Dahl.
[01:51:58.556 --> 01:52:06.820]  And Hank said, you know, countries like India and Brazil, where we get a lot of our protein, Brazil, are just not going to get enough fertilizers in 2023.
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.901]  Here we are, 2023.
[01:52:08.901 --> 01:52:12.243]  So they're not going to get enough of their nitrogenous fertilizers this year.
[01:52:12.543 --> 01:52:14.245]  And that's going to create an angrier world.
[01:52:14.245 --> 01:52:21.172]  I've seen UN numbers that once the third world spends a certain amount of its paycheck on food, war always starts.
[01:52:21.172 --> 01:52:29.080]  So when Klaus Schwab says the angrier world will bring in our Great Reset, they're orchestrating the collapse, but they believe they'll pose as saviors during the collapse.
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:30.862]  Pandemic, famine, war.
[01:52:30.862 --> 01:52:33.165]  The four horsemen, straight from the Bible.
[01:52:33.165 --> 01:52:34.706]  And the information war, as you did.
[01:52:35.787 --> 01:52:46.429]  Then, when people are in this emotional state of being quite hungry, and not only that, they're handing out phones to many of the migrants who are coming across the border into the United States.
[01:52:46.429 --> 01:52:49.450]  You can control these people with their phones, obviously, right?
[01:52:49.450 --> 01:52:53.551]  You can give instructions and say, hey, come to Alex Jones' place.
[01:52:53.551 --> 01:52:54.431]  Destroy it.
[01:52:54.431 --> 01:52:56.451]  You'll get paid if you even show up.
[01:52:56.451 --> 01:52:57.711]  First, they'll just get you to show up.
[01:52:57.711 --> 01:52:58.852]  We'll put some money on your phone.
[01:52:58.852 --> 01:53:00.052]  And Antifa is a drill of that.
[01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:01.644]  I'm sorry, sir?
[01:53:01.644 --> 01:53:03.025]  Antifa's a test of that.
[01:53:03.025 --> 01:53:03.846]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:03.846 --> 01:53:05.607]  Antifa, I was out with them in Hong Kong.
[01:53:05.607 --> 01:53:07.809]  Believe it or not, Antifa was in Hong Kong.
[01:53:07.809 --> 01:53:15.794]  I was there for... I didn't even know much about Antifa until I was in Hong Kong and there was Antifa people there, learning how to fight and that sort of thing.
[01:53:15.794 --> 01:53:20.578]  And so, you'll... I was there in the fighting in Hong Kong for seven months until they kicked me out, but...
[01:53:21.118 --> 01:53:30.023]  When you see Antifa then started using the umbrellas and different techniques that you would see in Hong Kong, they learned those techniques and they brought them back.
[01:53:30.023 --> 01:53:35.866]  When I left there, I went over to Portland and I was out in the fighting in Portland and watching these techniques.
[01:53:35.866 --> 01:53:39.108]  Now when I went to the January 6th thing, I was there actually.
[01:53:39.108 --> 01:53:39.988]  I didn't go inside.
[01:53:39.988 --> 01:53:41.549]  I sensed that it was a trap.
[01:53:41.549 --> 01:53:42.930]  I went to the door and I was like, you know what?
[01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:43.930]  Don't
[01:53:58.607 --> 01:54:01.188]  On January 6th was filled with agent provocateurs.
[01:54:01.188 --> 01:54:03.550]  I'm always watching for people with antennas, right?
[01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:10.293]  Always, when you're looking for, you know, who's operating with who, when they start talking on their radios, they're usually looking for the guy they're trying to talk with.
[01:54:10.293 --> 01:54:19.898]  So I was spotting the cells, there were a lot of cells, I was... And now it's coming out, Adam Schiff freaks out, after Tucker Carlson granted access, January 6th footage, Biden,
[01:54:21.337 --> 01:54:22.537]  Again, is very scared of this.
[01:54:22.537 --> 01:54:31.140]  January 6th, prisoners and their families petitioned Speaker McCarthy to release all 41,000 hours to crowdsourcing, but I'm glad Tucker's into it.
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.900]  That's really scaring the deep state.
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:40.462]  New video of Ray Epps hurling giant Trump sign at police on January 6th was never arrested, like several Trump supporters who touched the same sign.
[01:54:42.034 --> 01:54:46.738]  And notice as we go deeper and deeper into this, the information war is becoming more and more intense.
[01:54:46.738 --> 01:54:48.479]  More and more dog kings.
[01:54:48.479 --> 01:54:51.222]  Oh yeah, we got into dog kings and got cut off.
[01:54:51.222 --> 01:54:53.003]  Keep going with dog kings.
[01:54:53.003 --> 01:54:54.164]  Demoralization technique.
[01:54:54.164 --> 01:54:55.725]  Yes, a demoralization technique.
[01:54:55.725 --> 01:54:57.026]  Very effective.
[01:54:57.026 --> 01:55:01.710]  Like Caligula apparently may have made his horse into a senator.
[01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:03.592]  Whether that actually happened, who knows?
[01:55:03.592 --> 01:55:04.032]  But anyway.
[01:55:04.272 --> 01:55:06.294]  That's a sort of dog king, right?
[01:55:06.294 --> 01:55:08.355]  So you basically put idiots in charge.
[01:55:08.355 --> 01:55:10.857]  You put the Biden, that sort of thing.
[01:55:10.857 --> 01:55:14.740]  And it demoralizes people that don't- Harris, Fetterman, this is all on purpose.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:15.280]  Exactly.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.261]  Fetterman is obviously Fetterman.
[01:55:17.261 --> 01:55:18.843]  And so that's a dog king.
[01:55:18.843 --> 01:55:27.889]  Now, it demoralizes the population itself, but also emboldens your enemies and saying, look, those Americans or whomever will actually follow whatever they're told to do.
[01:55:27.889 --> 01:55:28.670]  I thought that too.
[01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:33.153]  I thought the disastrous Afghan withdrawal was to make Russia feel strong to move into Ukraine.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:36.022]  Yeah, that's what I think as well.
[01:55:36.022 --> 01:55:39.224]  And I was deeply involved in getting Americans out, by the way.
[01:55:39.224 --> 01:55:43.046]  I mean, you go for ten hours, there's so much stuff.
[01:55:43.046 --> 01:55:44.687]  Anyway, that's a whole separate story.
[01:55:44.687 --> 01:55:50.571]  But the Dog King thing is obviously... You know, there's a really important book that everybody should read called Rape of the Mind.
[01:55:50.571 --> 01:55:56.495]  Rape of the Mind is from 1954, and it goes through all... I've written three books on information war.
[01:55:56.495 --> 01:55:58.597]  They're only in Japanese, unfortunately.
[01:55:58.597 --> 01:56:01.619]  So if you don't speak Japanese, then you're going to have a hard time.
[01:56:02.299 --> 01:56:12.531]  If you read Rape of the Mind and you look around what just happened and what is happening right now, you will be vaccinated against mind rape.
[01:56:12.531 --> 01:56:13.252]  That's key.
[01:56:13.252 --> 01:56:15.915]  If you're aware of it, then it doesn't control you.
[01:56:15.915 --> 01:56:16.736]  It's much harder.
[01:56:17.176 --> 01:56:18.556]  Just watch the TV and get brainwashed.
[01:56:43.263 --> 01:56:44.063]  That's right.
[01:56:44.063 --> 01:56:46.404]  Rape of the Mind.
[01:56:46.404 --> 01:56:47.025]  1954 book.
[01:56:47.025 --> 01:56:52.447]  You know, I was over in Matthias Dessmann, you know, the Belgian psychologist.
[01:56:52.447 --> 01:56:59.549]  I was at his home last year with the famous Japanese journalist Masako Kanaho, who's probably watching now from Japan.
[01:56:59.549 --> 01:57:05.492]  And we were in his home, and I was looking at his books, and I was looking for Rape of the Mind, and there it was.
[01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:08.154]  I said, do you mind if I photograph your books?
[01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:11.017]  And he allowed me to... I think he's been on your show, hasn't he?
[01:57:11.017 --> 01:57:11.697]  He has been.
[01:57:11.697 --> 01:57:14.520]  And so he, you know, we talked about Rape of the Mind.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:15.841]  He's another person who's read it.
[01:57:15.841 --> 01:57:16.702]  It's a very important book.
[01:57:16.702 --> 01:57:17.643]  Oh, we got another hour coming up.
[01:57:17.643 --> 01:57:18.264]  I'm trying to shut up.
[01:57:18.264 --> 01:57:18.704]  We have the floor.
[01:57:18.704 --> 01:57:19.085]  I want to get...
[01:57:20.382 --> 01:57:21.463]  Into the cannibal story.
[01:57:21.463 --> 01:57:22.924]  I want to get into the military stories.
[01:57:22.924 --> 01:57:29.571]  I want to get into, you're a smart guy, this is a citizen, this is a human, what do you think we should do to stop this?
[01:57:29.571 --> 01:57:30.932]  How is it going for the New World Order?
[01:57:30.932 --> 01:57:33.654]  Because at some levels they seem to be winning, but at a lot of levels they're not.
[01:57:33.654 --> 01:57:40.581]  I mean, just last week you've got Elon Musk confronting the World Government Summit, saying you're failing, you're evil, you're going to kill us.
[01:57:40.581 --> 01:57:42.402]  I mean, a lot of stuff's happening.
[01:57:42.402 --> 01:57:44.905]  Hour number three with our special guest, Michael Gyan.
[01:57:44.905 --> 01:57:45.726]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:57:51.201 --> 01:57:57.606]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[01:57:57.606 --> 01:57:59.347]  World War III has already started.
[01:57:59.347 --> 01:58:01.669]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:02.830]  There's mass censorship.
[01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:05.032]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:58:05.032 --> 01:58:07.293]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:58:07.293 --> 01:58:11.697]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[01:58:11.937 --> 01:58:15.899]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[01:58:15.899 --> 01:58:24.302]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.

[01:59:43.999 --> 01:59:45.241]  Massive, massive savings.
[02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:01.791]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[02:00:01.791 --> 02:00:04.615]  If I were the devil.
[02:00:04.615 --> 02:00:08.780]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:15.388]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[02:00:15.388 --> 02:00:16.789]  Thee.
[02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:21.380]  So I'd set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:25.203]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[02:00:25.203 --> 02:00:26.664]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[02:00:26.664 --> 02:00:28.806]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[02:00:28.806 --> 02:00:32.208]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:33.649]  Do as you please.
[02:00:33.649 --> 02:00:36.211]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[02:00:36.211 --> 02:00:40.075]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[02:00:40.075 --> 02:00:44.178]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[02:00:44.178 --> 02:00:46.360]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:50.522]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[02:00:50.522 --> 02:00:51.743]  And then I'd get organized.
[02:00:51.743 --> 02:00:57.786]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[02:00:57.786 --> 02:01:01.208]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[02:01:01.208 --> 02:01:02.949]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[02:01:02.949 --> 02:01:06.271]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[02:01:06.271 --> 02:01:08.112]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[02:01:09.593 --> 02:01:21.461]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[02:01:21.461 --> 02:01:25.684]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flames.
[02:01:25.684 --> 02:01:29.367]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:01:29.367 --> 02:01:35.711]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the disciplined emotions children those run wild.
[02:01:36.011 --> 02:01:41.314]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[02:01:41.314 --> 02:01:47.056]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[02:01:47.056 --> 02:01:52.179]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[02:01:52.179 --> 02:01:56.961]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[02:01:56.961 --> 02:02:04.725]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have, and give to those who wanted, until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[02:02:06.438 --> 02:02:08.239]  I would caution against extremes.
[02:02:08.239 --> 02:02:09.259]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:02:09.259 --> 02:02:10.819]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:02:10.819 --> 02:02:11.900]  This isn't a game!
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:23.463]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[02:02:23.463 --> 02:02:31.946]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[02:02:31.946 --> 02:02:35.067]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[02:02:54.398 --> 02:02:57.950]  Now you know... the rest of the story.
[02:03:03.072 --> 02:03:11.856]  The young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this cabinet, are actually young noble leaders of the world, correct?
[02:03:11.856 --> 02:03:17.319]  So if we penetrate the cabinets, the change is not just happening.
[02:03:17.319 --> 02:03:21.881]  The change can be shaped by us.
[02:03:21.881 --> 02:03:24.802]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[02:03:24.802 --> 02:03:25.923]  How to prepare?
[02:03:25.923 --> 02:03:29.024]  To take the necessary action to create a fairer world.
[02:03:32.168 --> 02:03:34.630]  I see the need for a great reset.
[02:03:34.630 --> 02:03:41.714]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:44.916]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[02:03:44.916 --> 02:03:46.757]  It will not happen.
[02:03:46.757 --> 02:03:51.139]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[02:03:51.139 --> 02:03:54.801]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:56.983]  Pay insufficient attention.
[02:03:57.844 --> 02:04:14.748]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[02:04:14.748 --> 02:04:25.930]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen, in this respect, as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[02:04:59.552 --> 02:05:02.273]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:05:02.273 --> 02:05:07.154]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:05:07.154 --> 02:05:12.455]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[02:05:12.455 --> 02:05:22.478]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[02:05:23.178 --> 02:05:29.442]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[02:05:29.442 --> 02:05:31.343]  Ultimate Bone Broth, back in stock.
[02:05:31.343 --> 02:05:39.087]  Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[02:05:39.087 --> 02:05:41.269]  It's all available at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:41.269 --> 02:05:43.470]  Some of the very best products and a lot of
[02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:45.451]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's playing the sea.
[02:06:10.635 --> 02:06:12.496]  He never gives up.
[02:06:12.496 --> 02:06:14.917]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.917 --> 02:06:18.238]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:06:21.551 --> 02:06:26.112]  You know, I've said that I know who Michael Yon is for a decade.
[02:06:26.112 --> 02:06:27.453]  No, I've been on air 28 years.
[02:06:27.453 --> 02:06:31.374]  I remember him in coverage in the Iraq War, the second one in 2003.
[02:06:31.374 --> 02:06:38.356]  I mean, dude, I feel like I totally know you, but I've just read your name and seen some of your reports over the years over and over again.
[02:06:38.356 --> 02:06:43.478]  And when I saw you on Mike Adams a few months ago, I said, oh, this is the guy with Jordan Peterson with the great reporting from the Netherlands.
[02:06:43.478 --> 02:06:44.518]  I've got to get him on.
[02:06:44.518 --> 02:06:47.579]  And then luckily you were here with Mike yesterday and you moved to Texas.
[02:06:47.579 --> 02:06:48.779]  That's amazing.
[02:06:48.779 --> 02:06:49.760]  But you're a humble guy.
[02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:59.172]  But I think what you said is this, you were in special forces, you saw things, you realized information war was the next level, so you got into the information war as a journalist to tell the truth.
[02:06:59.172 --> 02:07:04.213]  So people really respect you, a lot of the listeners are really excited you're on, most of them know who you are.
[02:07:04.213 --> 02:07:11.716]  Give us just as an American, as a human, your view of the world and who the power players are and what's really happening in Ukraine and where you see this all going.
[02:07:13.032 --> 02:07:17.015]  First of all, the Ukraine war is, at best, terrible.
[02:07:17.015 --> 02:07:21.538]  I mean, it's a huge, huge error for the United States to be involved.
[02:07:21.538 --> 02:07:23.799]  Not to get into all the details, but it's... No, go ahead.
[02:07:23.799 --> 02:07:24.840]  You have the floor.
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:25.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:30.243]  You know, I lived in Poland for two... Let's go back to my Special Forces days.
[02:07:30.243 --> 02:07:34.246]  I was on two different A-teams in Special Forces as a Green Beret.
[02:07:34.246 --> 02:07:39.730]  And both of those teams, I can say it now, it was classified at the time, but we trained to parachute into Poland.
[02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.490]  Thank you.
[02:08:01.479 --> 02:08:03.141]  Things that go on in that region.
[02:08:03.141 --> 02:08:05.022]  You know the cultural terrain.
[02:08:05.022 --> 02:08:06.164]  Very.
[02:08:06.164 --> 02:08:19.857]  I've spent six years in Europe, or almost seven at this point, and so I've been all over Europe, and in fact I'll be going back again in a few days to go back home with Jordan Peterson, actually, and I may go to Ukraine, actually.
[02:08:19.857 --> 02:08:21.418]  Go ahead.
[02:08:21.418 --> 02:08:21.839]  I'm listening.
[02:08:22.199 --> 02:08:23.720]  Yeah, I may go to Ukraine.
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:31.387]  If I do, I'll probably go to Poland first and maybe Lithuania and talk with some of my contacts there and then mosey on over to Ukraine.
[02:08:31.387 --> 02:08:31.848]  It's unclear.
[02:08:31.848 --> 02:08:34.710]  I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.
[02:08:34.710 --> 02:08:36.732]  I'll kind of follow my nose when I get there.
[02:08:36.732 --> 02:08:44.199]  But as you can see, we are getting into a time of war that's going to unfold over a period of years.
[02:08:46.065 --> 02:08:47.726]  That's key.
[02:08:47.726 --> 02:08:49.166]  This is just the start.
[02:08:49.166 --> 02:08:50.006]  Oh, clearly.
[02:08:50.006 --> 02:08:56.568]  And again, before I came on today, I called Mike Flynn, General Flynn, and I said, hey, I'm going to go on with Alex today.
[02:08:56.568 --> 02:09:01.190]  Let's strategize some of the important things to talk about with you.
[02:09:01.190 --> 02:09:02.950]  Of course, he watches your show.
[02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:07.031]  And one is just how close we are to a thermonuclear war.
[02:09:07.031 --> 02:09:08.572]  I mean, we are that close.
[02:09:08.572 --> 02:09:10.332]  Russia clearly feels threatened.
[02:09:10.332 --> 02:09:11.613]  And if I were them, I mean,
[02:09:13.214 --> 02:09:22.689]  If China were putting troops in Mexico and in Canada on the borders, you know, in large numbers or any numbers, which they may be doing among... The U.S.
[02:09:22.689 --> 02:09:23.070]  would hit them.
[02:09:24.105 --> 02:09:25.105]  I would.
[02:09:25.105 --> 02:09:33.289]  I mean, if Canada were starting to allow, you know, Chinese to station themselves across our border, Canada would become enemy territory.
[02:09:33.289 --> 02:09:36.450]  Not Canadians, but Canada territory, of course.
[02:09:36.450 --> 02:09:37.651]  And, of course, Ukraine.
[02:09:37.651 --> 02:09:41.672]  Keep in mind, Ukraine and Russia have been fighting each other since forever, right?
[02:09:41.672 --> 02:09:44.453]  It's the white people Middle East, is what I call it, right?
[02:09:44.453 --> 02:09:45.474]  And Europe in general.
[02:09:45.914 --> 02:09:49.297]  Uh, is, is always been a fractious area.
[02:09:49.297 --> 02:09:56.884]  It's only had this, uh, interregnum of peace post-World War II because of US troops in particular.
[02:09:56.884 --> 02:09:58.526]  I used to be stationed there.
[02:09:58.526 --> 02:10:00.988]  We are obviously the ones that kept the peace there.
[02:10:00.988 --> 02:10:03.590]  We're pulling back now and now we're instigating.
[02:10:03.590 --> 02:10:05.752]  I mean, we clearly attacked Nord Stream.
[02:10:05.752 --> 02:10:06.953]  Is there proof of that?
[02:10:06.953 --> 02:10:09.996]  You know, when it was still bubbling up, a lot of us thought,
[02:10:10.316 --> 02:10:10.796]  Hmm.
[02:10:10.796 --> 02:10:11.817]  Who could have done that?
[02:10:11.817 --> 02:10:13.819]  Not the Russians, obviously.
[02:10:13.819 --> 02:10:14.819]  Not the Germans.
[02:10:14.819 --> 02:10:17.121]  You know, that was their pipeline, right?
[02:10:17.121 --> 02:10:21.584]  And Biden and others had threatened to do something with Nord Stream.
[02:10:21.584 --> 02:10:23.606]  Now, Nord Stream is vital.
[02:10:23.606 --> 02:10:28.990]  When most of the Europeans wake up to what actually just happened with Nord Stream, I think a lot of them are still asleep.
[02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:30.851]  They don't realize what just happened.
[02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:32.573]  We really just damaged them.
[02:10:32.573 --> 02:10:34.454]  And it's going to unfold as 2023 unfolds.
[02:10:34.454 --> 02:10:35.715]  I saw a number where it was over
[02:10:41.471 --> 02:10:46.933]  A hundred billion dollars the Germans have spent alone to hide the energy cost increase from the Germans.
[02:10:46.933 --> 02:10:48.793]  And as you know, they can't do it forever.
[02:10:48.793 --> 02:10:50.834]  Another good, great book is When Money Dies.
[02:10:50.834 --> 02:10:55.555]  That's a good book to refer back to in the early twenties when, anyway.
[02:10:55.555 --> 02:11:04.638]  So when you say this is the beginning, they're building permanent arms factories in Poland, they're saying it's probably a three-year war, that's in the RAND Corporation reports that you just alluded to.
[02:11:04.638 --> 02:11:06.539]  So how does this multi-year war go?
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:14.345]  Well, as you know, with war, anybody who thinks they can predict which way a war can go is actually a fool.
[02:11:14.345 --> 02:11:19.529]  Anybody who thinks they can start a war and control it knows nothing about war.
[02:11:19.529 --> 02:11:21.271]  Wars do what pandemics do.
[02:11:21.271 --> 02:11:22.652]  They get out of control.
[02:11:22.652 --> 02:11:24.313]  And war makes war, right?
[02:11:24.313 --> 02:11:24.834]  They escalate.
[02:11:25.474 --> 02:11:27.435]  Yeah, war creates war.
[02:11:27.435 --> 02:11:29.116]  Pandemic creates pandemic.
[02:11:29.116 --> 02:11:30.776]  Famine creates famine.
[02:11:30.776 --> 02:11:33.137]  And they all create each other, right?
[02:11:33.137 --> 02:11:39.000]  Ukraine is one of the breadbaskets of the world, and now it's very, you know, interrupted, of course.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:46.263]  Many of the farmers are either fighting, or they've left, or they can't fight, or their farmland has been bombed, they can't go back.
[02:11:47.683 --> 02:11:50.364]  One piece off the chessboard, right?
[02:11:50.364 --> 02:11:55.146]  Now we've got Nord Stream interrupted, well not interrupted, destroyed.
[02:11:55.146 --> 02:11:58.147]  So many other interruptions are unfolding now.
[02:11:58.147 --> 02:12:00.908]  Conditions are being set for global famine.
[02:12:00.908 --> 02:12:08.191]  And global famine, the last time I think we saw a sincere global famine, if you want to call it that, would be about 1816, the year without a summer.
[02:12:11.672 --> 02:12:22.319]  The volcanic eruption in 1815, it kind of unfolded in 1816 and 1817, you know, because the atmosphere was filled with... Was that Krakatoa or another one?
[02:12:22.319 --> 02:12:24.640]  No, it wasn't Krakatoa, it was Tambora, right?
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.802]  And so that was, you know, in 1815.
[02:12:27.802 --> 02:12:30.483]  There's a great book on it called The Year Without a Summer, actually.
[02:12:30.483 --> 02:12:39.469]  It's interesting when they analyzed old paintings from the time period, not just that volcanic eruption, but others, the artists, the great artists would have a little bit more red in their sunsets.
[02:12:39.969 --> 02:12:42.870]  So you can analyze, you know, art history actually has more purpose than this.
[02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:44.190]  And the plants don't grow as well.
[02:12:44.190 --> 02:12:49.411]  So, Klaus Schwab brags that they're artificially doing this to collapse the old system and bring in the new.
[02:12:49.411 --> 02:12:52.372]  How does the elite, like you said, think they're going to control this?
[02:12:52.372 --> 02:12:53.772]  I mean, this is out of control.
[02:12:53.772 --> 02:12:58.254]  Yeah, notice how they're floating cannibalism now as well, right?
[02:12:58.254 --> 02:12:59.754]  That's why I made this joke a few years ago.
[02:13:00.094 --> 02:13:00.654]  Yeah.
[02:13:00.654 --> 02:13:02.155]  Oh, you can see it coming.
[02:13:02.155 --> 02:13:06.096]  When I saw you do that, I said, look, he sees it like normal.
[02:13:06.096 --> 02:13:15.319]  You're usually so far ahead of everybody else's headlights that it sounds crazy, as you know, but it just turns out you just happen to be right before other people picked up on it.
[02:13:15.319 --> 02:13:23.521]  And for instance, the cannibalism thing, you can see it getting floated around now in different magazines and newspapers and online.
[02:13:23.521 --> 02:13:24.841]  New York Times.
[02:13:24.841 --> 02:13:25.822]  That's right, New York Times.
[02:13:25.822 --> 02:13:27.222]  Well, you're an expert on cannibalism.
[02:13:27.222 --> 02:13:29.343]  You tracked him and actually arrested him and stopped him.
[02:13:30.063 --> 02:13:36.465]  I saw a Pentagon report, I forget the name, like 20 years ago, that within 15 days of a total breakdown, most people become cannibals.
[02:13:36.465 --> 02:13:38.206]  Within 10 days, most people will commit murder.
[02:13:38.206 --> 02:13:40.066]  Can you speak to that?
[02:13:40.066 --> 02:13:43.208]  Yeah, I mean, I didn't arrest any, but I certainly tracked some down.
[02:13:43.208 --> 02:13:48.649]  You know, the reason I tracked them down, I was taking a break in the action, actually, I went cannibal hunting.
[02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:52.891]  But when I was in Special Forces, I had some really great mentors, and I was told
[02:13:53.431 --> 02:14:05.961]  Study world religions, study cults, study anthropology, which sounded kind of strange because I'm like, hey, I'm a young Green Beret, I should be studying explosives, you know, and I should be studying warfare, right?
[02:14:05.961 --> 02:14:07.703]  Winning the hearts and minds is most important.
[02:14:07.703 --> 02:14:12.127]  Yeah, but that upper level, that next level is information war, right?
[02:14:12.127 --> 02:14:20.493]  And so I began, I found out that I was very interested in anthropology when I started reading, like I've read everything Joseph Campbell ever has written as an example.
[02:14:20.493 --> 02:14:21.034]  He's dead on.
[02:14:21.334 --> 02:14:22.714]  Yeah, he's right on.
[02:14:22.714 --> 02:14:24.815]  Hero with a Thousand Faces, I read that three times.
[02:14:24.815 --> 02:14:25.675]  I read all of his books.
[02:14:25.675 --> 02:14:26.855]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:26.855 --> 02:14:29.556]  So I mean, and I've traveled around the world quite a lot.
[02:14:29.556 --> 02:14:31.576]  Well, about 90 countries.
[02:14:31.576 --> 02:14:32.957]  Most of my life has been overseas.
[02:14:32.957 --> 02:14:38.138]  So I was in India, just taking a break, and I was out photographing a tiger and that sort of thing.
[02:14:38.138 --> 02:14:40.238]  And I came across some cannibals.
[02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:42.019]  And it was quite interesting.
[02:14:42.019 --> 02:14:46.380]  And then I realized some Americans were involved, including one from Houston, right?
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:47.940]  It took me a long time to figure out.
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:50.721]  When I said arrested, I think you're tracking him, led to him getting grabbed, right?
[02:14:51.843 --> 02:14:52.884]  Well, he's dead now.
[02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:56.048]  But he ended up being arrested when he tried to kill me, actually.
[02:14:56.048 --> 02:14:57.389]  But his name was Gary Stevenson.
[02:14:57.389 --> 02:15:00.132]  He was born on December 3rd, 1950 in Houston.
[02:15:00.132 --> 02:15:00.873]  His dad was an artist.
[02:15:00.873 --> 02:15:07.020]  I've got all of his family photos and, you know, actual copies, the prints of his family photos, the originals.
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:10.483]  And I got his daughter to take a DNA test for me and this sort of thing.
[02:15:10.483 --> 02:15:11.825]  I hunted down a lot of cannibals.
[02:15:12.105 --> 02:15:33.124]  But the bottom line is, it's interesting, it's a cult called Agor, which has been around for at least 600 years, and they believe, I can explain this in like 15 seconds, the kernel of the religion, it's a subsect of Hinduism, but they believe God or the gods are perfect and created everything, and therefore everything is perfect, so if you're disgusted by anything, you're disgusted by God.
[02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:34.405]  So you should do everything.
[02:15:34.405 --> 02:15:36.867]  So one of the things they do is cannibalism, right?
[02:15:36.867 --> 02:15:38.749]  And they do it openly, they won't hide it, they'll
[02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:41.532]  Like, like we would eat fried chicken.
[02:15:41.532 --> 02:15:44.555]  I mean, uh, let's start at the beginning.
[02:15:44.555 --> 02:15:46.458]  This is so interesting.
[02:15:46.458 --> 02:15:48.080]  The adventures you've been on, it's all on record.
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:48.881]  You did all this stuff.
[02:15:48.881 --> 02:15:50.423]  What, what a life.
[02:15:50.423 --> 02:15:50.723]  Stay there.
[02:15:50.723 --> 02:15:53.226]  I want to hear about this cannibal situation.
[02:15:53.226 --> 02:15:54.668]  Now he tried to kill you when we come back.
[02:15:54.668 --> 02:15:55.689]  Amazing.
[02:15:55.689 --> 02:15:57.752]  You can find Michael Yan's work at Michael...
[02:15:58.303 --> 02:16:01.325]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[02:16:01.325 --> 02:16:09.689]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:16:09.689 --> 02:16:19.214]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:16:19.214 --> 02:16:24.697]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:16:24.697 --> 02:16:27.399]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[02:16:27.639 --> 02:16:30.060]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:35.242]  You're not going to find 1,000 mg high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:16:35.242 --> 02:16:37.603]  You're not going to find it at the 10 mg or 20 mg.
[02:16:37.603 --> 02:16:41.384]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:16:41.384 --> 02:16:44.045]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:16:44.045 --> 02:16:50.147]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:16:50.147 --> 02:16:54.528]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:54.528 --> 02:16:55.229]  A true 360 win.
[02:16:58.061 --> 02:17:04.226]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[02:17:04.226 --> 02:17:17.217]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting Infowarstore.com right now and taking action.
[02:17:17.217 --> 02:17:22.161]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:24.223]  Keep Info Wars on the air.
[02:17:24.223 --> 02:17:26.525]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:17:26.525 --> 02:17:27.986]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:17:27.986 --> 02:17:29.227]  They're coming for me.
[02:17:29.227 --> 02:17:30.468]  They're coming for the children.
[02:17:30.468 --> 02:17:33.051]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:17:33.051 --> 02:17:36.414]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:37.715]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:17:37.955 --> 02:17:40.057]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:17:40.057 --> 02:17:45.481]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these waves of shots.
[02:17:45.481 --> 02:17:49.404]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[02:17:49.404 --> 02:17:50.625]  Let's do it together.
[02:17:50.625 --> 02:17:52.906]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:52.906 --> 02:17:56.729]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:17:56.729 --> 02:17:57.710]  Now take action now!
[02:17:57.990 --> 02:18:10.496]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:23.547]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:18:23.547 --> 02:18:35.395]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:18:35.395 --> 02:18:36.916]  This is why they attack us.
[02:18:37.396 --> 02:18:39.937]  This is why we need your support.
[02:18:39.937 --> 02:18:41.717]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:18:41.717 --> 02:18:43.918]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:43.918 --> 02:18:45.338]  Join the resistance.
[02:18:45.338 --> 02:18:46.659]  Buy products.
[02:18:46.659 --> 02:18:48.439]  Donate to the cause.
[02:18:48.439 --> 02:18:49.820]  Share the links.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:52.240]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.441]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:18:57.864 --> 02:18:58.144]  If you go
[02:19:17.841 --> 02:19:19.482]  That features natokinase.
[02:19:19.482 --> 02:19:21.823]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:21.823 --> 02:19:27.506]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.506 --> 02:19:28.306]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.306 --> 02:19:33.349]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:34.849]  People are low with the spike protein.
[02:19:34.849 --> 02:19:35.790]  They don't feel well.
[02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:37.511]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:37.511 --> 02:19:40.552]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.552 --> 02:19:43.473]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.473 --> 02:19:44.454]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:19:44.834 --> 02:19:50.997]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[02:19:50.997 --> 02:19:55.458]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[02:19:55.458 --> 02:19:58.860]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:04.762]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:30.131 --> 02:20:34.452]  Michael, you're on in studio with us for the rest of the hour, just ribbiting stuff, you've got so much knowledge.
[02:20:34.452 --> 02:20:41.074]  You got interrupted by the break, get back to you're in India photographing tigers, you learn about a cannibal cult, and then, wow.
[02:20:41.074 --> 02:20:58.418]  Oh yeah, I saw these missing Westerner signs all over the place, and I actually encountered a cannibal, weirdly, and long story short, I spent six, I heard stories about one from Hawaii and or Texas, and finally, it took six months and
[02:20:58.998 --> 02:21:01.360]  Just unbelievable things I learned.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:06.024]  I studied everything I could about this cult, trying to find out if Westerners were involved.
[02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:07.726]  For instance, I heard about some Italians.
[02:21:07.726 --> 02:21:09.407]  I flew over to Italy and I found them.
[02:21:09.407 --> 02:21:13.591]  I physically met them and went to one of their homes and that sort of thing.
[02:21:13.591 --> 02:21:15.653]  I infiltrated one of the cults in California.
[02:21:15.653 --> 02:21:16.694]  There were some in California.
[02:21:17.174 --> 02:21:18.695]  I lived with him.
[02:21:18.695 --> 02:21:23.498]  But before all that, I tracked the first American down in Texas.
[02:21:23.498 --> 02:21:24.599]  I mean, he's from Texas.
[02:21:24.599 --> 02:21:25.640]  He was from Houston.
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:30.543]  His dad was an army officer in World War II in Papua New Guinea.
[02:21:30.543 --> 02:21:34.726]  Actually, his super great grandfather was the one who brought Methodism to Texas.
[02:21:34.726 --> 02:21:36.127]  I have his autobiography in the early 1800s.
[02:21:38.268 --> 02:21:40.209]  Anyway, so he read a book.
[02:21:40.209 --> 02:21:42.349]  His name was Gary Stevenson, the American Cannibal.
[02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:44.210]  He read a book when he was 15 years old.
[02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:47.350]  He had polio on his left leg, and it shriveled his leg, right?
[02:21:47.350 --> 02:21:49.891]  He got that in 1952 in June, right?
[02:21:49.891 --> 02:21:58.113]  There was a major outbreak of polio that year, and the two worst places were Houston and Los Angeles, and he was in Houston.
[02:21:58.113 --> 02:21:59.074]  And he got polio.
[02:21:59.074 --> 02:22:01.194]  He came from a nice family.
[02:22:01.194 --> 02:22:03.975]  Most of the polio victims actually came from nice families.
[02:22:03.975 --> 02:22:05.976]  They weren't the poor Irish kids, that sort of thing.
[02:22:05.976 --> 02:22:07.496]  They were actually people like Gary.
[02:22:07.896 --> 02:22:08.176]  Thank you.
[02:22:23.248 --> 02:22:23.928]  We're good to go.
[02:22:43.938 --> 02:22:49.581]  So anyway, Gary Stevenson became a Hare Krishna and then he finally left that.
[02:22:49.581 --> 02:22:52.283]  Hare Krishna are not cannibals by the way.
[02:22:52.283 --> 02:23:01.149]  And then he ended up moving to Hawaii, Gary Stevenson did, and then finally he moved to India and he joined this cult called Aghor.
[02:23:01.149 --> 02:23:10.975]  And that's where I got on his trail, tracked him down, he was drinking out of human skulls and he'd tell me things like, Michael don't drink out of a woman's skull because it leaks.
[02:23:11.035 --> 02:23:11.295]  I don't know.
[02:23:26.761 --> 02:23:29.484]  Yeah, folks don't know Tibet has cannibalism.
[02:23:47.671 --> 02:23:53.075]  Yeah, I didn't know that until I went up there and I saw these implements and I was like, hmm, you know, these aren't Hindus.
[02:23:53.075 --> 02:24:00.121]  And I started talking with some of the Tibetans about it and they're like, yeah, it's an old form of Buddhism and this sort of thing.
[02:24:00.121 --> 02:24:02.482]  Anyway, I tracked them down six times around the world.
[02:24:02.482 --> 02:24:04.504]  I tracked down many of these cannibals.
[02:24:04.504 --> 02:24:07.927]  Many Americans have joined, Italians and others.
[02:24:08.667 --> 02:24:10.008]  It's fascinating.
[02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:17.471]  With Gary Stevenson at one point, I was sitting, I interviewed him, the first time I found him I interviewed him for 18 days, right?
[02:24:17.471 --> 02:24:24.695]  And at one point I actually borrowed his passport, let's say, and I photographed it and I made a spreadsheet of all of his travels.
[02:24:24.695 --> 02:24:31.678]  And he had gone in, he had about 70 or 80 entries and exits from countries, Sri Lanka... How was he paying for all this?
[02:24:32.378 --> 02:24:33.598]  He got an insurance settlement.
[02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:39.480]  He got hit by a Chinese guy, he said, in Hawaii on a bicycle, Gary, with his leg.
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:42.641]  Despite his leg, he could ride a bicycle.
[02:24:42.641 --> 02:24:49.524]  In fact, I flew to Hawaii at one point, got his name changed, records, found people that were on his... So what ended up happening to him?
[02:24:49.524 --> 02:24:50.624]  He's dead.
[02:24:50.624 --> 02:24:53.565]  And I think he was poisoned.
[02:24:53.565 --> 02:24:54.645]  It's unclear at this point.
[02:24:54.645 --> 02:24:55.646]  I have his autopsy.
[02:24:55.646 --> 02:24:59.307]  In fact, I sent a spy back over to check some things out.
[02:24:59.307 --> 02:25:01.808]  And I think he was poisoned, but I'm unclear on that.
[02:25:03.362 --> 02:25:05.824]  How the hell do people get involved in a cannibalism cult?
[02:25:33.782 --> 02:25:37.564]  That guy's a fake-a-gory, but that's actually at Varanasi.
[02:25:37.564 --> 02:25:40.006]  That's near where I first met Gary the Cannibal GTC.
[02:25:40.006 --> 02:25:42.607]  That's on the other side of the river from Varanasi, right?
[02:25:42.607 --> 02:25:44.308]  I call that the dog side of the Ganges.
[02:25:44.308 --> 02:25:46.229]  How do you choose what you're going to cover?
[02:25:46.229 --> 02:25:47.670]  Because you've done so many things.
[02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:48.571]  I'm free.
[02:25:48.571 --> 02:25:50.031]  You know, I'm a free man.
[02:25:50.031 --> 02:25:54.134]  And so the last time I actually worked for somebody for a paycheck, I think, was Michael Jackson.
[02:25:54.594 --> 02:26:03.056]  When I was in school, after the Army, and I was in college in California, and I was offered a job with him, so I'd just do my calculus homework at Neverland.
[02:26:03.056 --> 02:26:10.917]  And then after that, I went off, started a business in Poland, and next thing you know, I was a war correspondent, and that sort of thing.
[02:26:10.917 --> 02:26:12.157]  So, yeah.
[02:26:12.157 --> 02:26:18.519]  Actually, I always wanted to be a physicist, and then I figured out, you know, I have too much energy, I can't sit still long enough to do something.
[02:26:18.519 --> 02:26:20.139]  So, pulling back to World War III,
[02:26:22.102 --> 02:26:23.184]  What is the exit strategy?
[02:26:23.184 --> 02:26:24.286]  Is there any way to stop this?
[02:26:24.286 --> 02:26:26.009]  Because the Russians aren't going to give up.
[02:26:26.009 --> 02:26:28.073]  The West isn't going to give up.
[02:26:28.073 --> 02:26:28.974]  It's escalating.
[02:26:28.974 --> 02:26:31.338]  How does this end?
[02:26:31.338 --> 02:26:34.965]  Well, we have, I call it OGUS, the Occupational Government of the United States.
[02:26:35.939 --> 02:26:38.340]  And we are clearly occupied.
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:41.461]  We are clearly what we were fighting against.
[02:26:41.461 --> 02:26:43.842]  We have become that thing, right?
[02:26:43.842 --> 02:26:45.403]  We have no borders.
[02:26:45.403 --> 02:26:46.444]  We're in Texas now.
[02:26:46.444 --> 02:26:49.365]  I've been down on this border quite a lot on the Mexican and Texas side.
[02:26:49.365 --> 02:26:54.147]  I've got trash bags filled with passports of migrants who just got them on the Mexican side.
[02:26:54.827 --> 02:27:16.420]  And there's no border, and Governor Abbott will sit here, I was on the Mexican side last year, and Governor Abbott's talking about all these border control measures they're doing, and I'm like, I'm right at the Rio Grande on the Mexican side, watching them cross the river, and our National Guard, Texas National Guard... And by the way, I'm no fan of Abbott, but in fairness, he captures them, the feds just let them go.
[02:27:17.711 --> 02:27:21.153]  He does, but here's the thing about Abbott.
[02:27:21.153 --> 02:27:23.214]  He's making it sound like they're doing something.
[02:27:23.214 --> 02:27:25.155]  Instead of saying, nothing's being done.
[02:27:25.155 --> 02:27:28.196]  Instead of saying, I don't have power, it's a federal issue, yeah.
[02:27:28.196 --> 02:27:30.317]  He's making it sound like we're actually doing something.
[02:27:30.317 --> 02:27:31.478]  They'll have troops walk around with a...
[02:27:34.959 --> 02:27:36.820]  We're not.
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:46.543]  If you actually physically go to the border yourself, you'll see there's these little tiny swaths of some National Guard, and then the other 99% of the border is wide open.
[02:27:46.543 --> 02:27:48.263]  And people are just crossing everywhere.
[02:27:48.263 --> 02:27:53.305]  And even when they cross right by the National Guard, the National Guard will put them on the buses and they go to the border.
[02:27:53.305 --> 02:27:54.005]  So what's the solution?
[02:27:54.813 --> 02:27:56.414]  Well, we need a new government.
[02:27:56.414 --> 02:27:57.495]  That's clear.
[02:27:57.495 --> 02:28:00.718]  We're not going to do it when you have dog kings in charge.
[02:28:00.718 --> 02:28:05.222]  Remember, the dog king did not get there by himself.
[02:28:05.222 --> 02:28:06.203]  He is a dog.
[02:28:06.203 --> 02:28:07.944]  Biden obviously did not.
[02:28:07.944 --> 02:28:09.726]  This obviously was a sham election.
[02:28:10.186 --> 02:28:16.292]  I was in Arizona for that election, you know, with Carrie Lake.
[02:28:16.292 --> 02:28:29.825]  The two polling stations I went to, I'd just been overseas for four months, I flew straight to Maricopa County, and the two polling stations I went to had problems with the voting machines, with the elections that we just had.
[02:28:29.825 --> 02:28:32.128]  Well, they gave them ballots in Republican districts that wouldn't work.
[02:28:33.035 --> 02:28:35.337]  Yeah, the voting machines weren't working.
[02:28:35.337 --> 02:28:39.561]  So there was people that couldn't vote, or they had to go far away and they couldn't go, and that sort of thing.
[02:28:39.561 --> 02:28:44.905]  And that happened to many of the voting, but the two that I went to, the voting machines weren't working.
[02:28:44.905 --> 02:28:47.528]  Obviously, I couldn't go to them all.
[02:28:47.528 --> 02:28:53.893]  I did a soil sample, you might say, and other people were giving me their reports, and it was just another stolen election.
[02:28:53.893 --> 02:28:55.034]  It's clear as day.
[02:28:55.034 --> 02:28:56.455]  So what do the globalists do next?
[02:28:56.455 --> 02:28:56.816]  Stay with us.
[02:28:59.855 --> 02:29:09.559]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[02:29:48.882 --> 02:29:51.323]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[02:29:51.323 --> 02:29:52.203]  We didn't have them for sale.
[02:29:52.203 --> 02:29:53.784]  But now, I signed the last books.
[02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:58.025]  You can get them right now.
[02:29:58.025 --> 02:29:59.726]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:29:59.726 --> 02:30:01.567]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:30:01.567 --> 02:30:06.969]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists.
[02:30:06.969 --> 02:30:09.650]  And I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:13.791]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:30:13.791 --> 02:30:16.452]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:30:18.353 --> 02:30:23.016]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[02:30:23.016 --> 02:30:25.018]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.

[02:30:51.607 --> 02:30:54.352]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!

[02:31:58.076 --> 02:31:59.897]  InfoWars is winning.
[02:31:59.897 --> 02:32:01.938]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:32:01.938 --> 02:32:04.719]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:32:04.719 --> 02:32:07.460]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:09.561]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:32:09.561 --> 02:32:11.622]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:32:11.622 --> 02:32:12.602]  None of that's true.
[02:32:12.602 --> 02:32:13.503]  It's all being appealed.
[02:32:13.963 --> 02:32:16.065]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[02:32:16.065 --> 02:32:22.950]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:26.393]  But if they convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:32:26.393 --> 02:32:29.095]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[02:32:29.095 --> 02:32:38.983]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[02:32:39.443 --> 02:32:40.803]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:32:40.803 --> 02:32:49.306]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today, because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:32:49.306 --> 02:32:52.687]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[02:32:52.687 --> 02:32:54.648]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[02:32:54.648 --> 02:32:58.829]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:32:58.829 --> 02:33:04.731]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.384 --> 02:33:18.512]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:18.512 --> 02:33:22.720]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:24.464]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.953 --> 02:33:26.213]  Crazy.
[02:33:26.213 --> 02:33:26.734]  Here we go.
[02:33:26.734 --> 02:33:27.354]  We're live.
[02:33:27.354 --> 02:33:29.076]  Mike Leon's on air with us.
[02:33:29.076 --> 02:33:30.297]  Look, I'm going to let you host the show.
[02:33:30.297 --> 02:33:31.999]  You've got so many stories to tell.
[02:33:31.999 --> 02:33:32.359]  So much.
[02:33:32.359 --> 02:33:34.361]  But the big thing is the farmers.
[02:33:34.361 --> 02:33:39.486]  I mean, to quantify this, I was reading the Dutch are the third largest food producer in the world.
[02:33:39.486 --> 02:33:41.088]  The whole thing's a giant farm.
[02:33:41.088 --> 02:33:42.069]  They're the super farmers.
[02:33:42.069 --> 02:33:43.250]  They're the supermen.
[02:33:43.250 --> 02:33:43.890]  The ubermenschen.
[02:33:44.731 --> 02:33:48.955]  The government's like, we're going to phase out one year 30% of your cows and a decade most your cows.
[02:33:48.955 --> 02:33:50.296]  We're going to shut all your farms down.
[02:33:50.296 --> 02:33:51.577]  We're going to take your property.
[02:33:51.577 --> 02:33:52.878]  They're doing it.
[02:33:52.878 --> 02:33:57.842]  And then they make the minister doing it like the head of the new UN food program to cut the food off.
[02:33:57.842 --> 02:34:07.110]  I mean, it's like, it's like Biden cutting off the Keystone Pipeline that would have cut gas prices, I'd say, by like 20% at least and given us hundreds of thousands of jobs total.
[02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:09.492]  I mean, it's like hard to believe they're at war with us.
[02:34:10.393 --> 02:34:11.733]  They're literally at war with us.
[02:34:11.733 --> 02:34:16.555]  And by the way, again, when you see this red handkerchief, that's a sign of the Dutch farmer resistance.
[02:34:16.555 --> 02:34:18.196]  That's why I carry it with me.
[02:34:18.196 --> 02:34:19.736]  And I'm going back over there again soon.
[02:34:19.736 --> 02:34:22.177]  Maybe Jordan, the dairy farmer, is watching this now.
[02:34:22.177 --> 02:34:25.578]  And Jordan talked about... I took Jordan Peterson to see Jordan, the farmer.
[02:34:25.578 --> 02:34:28.859]  He's one of the main resistance leaders there.
[02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:31.180]  Jordan talked about how the Dutch
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.421]  Government so controls all of their inputs.
[02:34:34.421 --> 02:34:38.142]  They know every gallon or every liter of diesel they get there.
[02:34:38.142 --> 02:34:41.504]  Every one of his cows has an ear tag.
[02:34:41.504 --> 02:34:43.325]  So they went along with the surveillance.
[02:34:43.325 --> 02:34:44.285]  They're using it for control.
[02:34:44.285 --> 02:34:46.686]  Lesson is don't opt into this.
[02:34:46.686 --> 02:34:48.867]  And so they're completely controlled.
[02:34:48.867 --> 02:34:50.527]  Like you can't have an extra cow.
[02:34:50.527 --> 02:34:51.468]  They'll know.
[02:34:51.468 --> 02:34:53.429]  For instance, the milk truck that comes every day.
[02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:54.829]  I've been over at his farm quite a lot.
[02:34:54.829 --> 02:34:55.730]  The milk truck comes.
[02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:57.170]  Here's the milk truck.
[02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:57.670]  It hooks it up.
[02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:59.551]  It knows exactly how many liters it got out.
[02:34:59.551 --> 02:35:00.491]  That sort of thing.
[02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:01.572]  Everything is controlled.
[02:35:01.972 --> 02:35:05.314]  And so it's interesting, when I was with, you've heard of gleaning before?
[02:35:05.314 --> 02:35:06.736]  Gleaning from the Bible?
[02:35:06.736 --> 02:35:07.656]  Gleaning?
[02:35:07.656 --> 02:35:17.183]  It's interesting, I was with Jorden, and Jorden said, you know, he's like one of those super tall Dutch people, he's talking to me, he's like, you know, Michael, they've started gleaning here again.
[02:35:17.183 --> 02:35:18.324]  Gleaning is from the Bible.
[02:35:18.724 --> 02:35:30.212]  It's when people go and, you know, when the crops are not completely pulled out of it, when people harvest their crops, let's say onions, and two to three percent of the onions are left in the field, people will come and collect those crops.
[02:35:30.212 --> 02:35:30.993]  That's called gleaning.
[02:35:30.993 --> 02:35:35.076]  There's a famous painting in France about gleaning that was highly political.
[02:35:35.076 --> 02:35:37.718]  You may have seen it before, the three ladies in the field and that sort of thing.
[02:35:38.198 --> 02:35:41.940]  Anyway, he told me that people are starting to glean again in Netherlands.
[02:35:41.940 --> 02:35:43.260]  He saw them gleaning right down.
[02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:46.321]  He has a dairy farm, so they're not gleaning on his farm.
[02:35:46.321 --> 02:35:48.682]  But down the road, there were Dutch people gleaning.
[02:35:48.682 --> 02:35:51.244]  He said he'd never seen that in his whole life.
[02:35:51.244 --> 02:35:53.184]  He heard his parents talking about it.
[02:35:53.184 --> 02:35:55.785]  He heard his grandparents talking about it from the war.
[02:35:55.785 --> 02:35:58.306]  But he had never seen it with his own eyes until 2022.
[02:35:59.767 --> 02:36:02.468]  And now the gleaning is starting actually in the United States now.
[02:36:02.468 --> 02:36:12.371]  It's when people go to the farms and start either stealing crops, which is not really gleaning, that's stealing, or they start just taking crops that weren't harvested, right?
[02:36:12.371 --> 02:36:13.372]  And now this is starting.
[02:36:13.372 --> 02:36:15.132]  This is one of those symptoms of famine.
[02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:19.494]  I read a lot of books on pandemic and famine, and you'll see- Look how much eggs cost now.
[02:36:20.094 --> 02:36:20.754]  Sir?
[02:36:20.754 --> 02:36:21.294]  Eggs.
[02:36:21.294 --> 02:36:22.215]  Oh, eggs, exactly.
[02:36:22.215 --> 02:36:26.696]  You know, I bought a lot of eggs, dehydrated eggs in 2020, and I've still got them.
[02:36:26.696 --> 02:36:28.096]  I bought a ton of them.
[02:36:28.096 --> 02:36:31.517]  And because I saw where I was going with eggs.
[02:36:31.517 --> 02:36:45.100]  You know, you can, if you study these things enough, they become less difficult to predict because there are a lot of patterns that are... And as he repeats, why does the ruling global class think they'll get away with this?
[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:46.200]  Because the good news is,
[02:36:46.997 --> 02:36:49.418]  They thought they'd carry this out and be the saviors.
[02:36:49.418 --> 02:36:51.119]  They're not carrying it out and being the saviors.
[02:36:51.119 --> 02:36:52.839]  People know they're behind it.
[02:36:52.839 --> 02:37:04.724]  Yeah, and you know, again, I mentioned earlier the famous Japanese journalist, Masako Kanaha, was recently over in Davos, and you notice she was the one who tracked down Klaus Schwab.
[02:37:04.724 --> 02:37:12.107]  And Klaus Schwab, and she was, you know, trying to ask him questions, and he got into his hybrid car, which was not an electric car, and he drove away.
[02:37:12.107 --> 02:37:15.808]  Interestingly, though, if you notice how much security he did not have, right?
[02:37:15.828 --> 02:37:16.469]  I don't know.
[02:37:42.970 --> 02:37:45.853]  He's clearly part of the information game.
[02:37:45.853 --> 02:37:49.957]  He is not the leader of WEF, World Economic Forum.
[02:37:49.957 --> 02:37:51.578]  I agree.
[02:37:51.578 --> 02:37:53.120]  So, what do you expect is going to happen?
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:56.743]  Give us your prognosis for the near and midterm.
[02:37:56.743 --> 02:37:57.724]  It's going to get bloody.
[02:37:57.724 --> 02:37:58.725]  I mean, that's obvious.
[02:37:58.725 --> 02:38:01.448]  It's because it's all about conditions, right?
[02:38:01.448 --> 02:38:04.390]  And again, one thing about wars is that
[02:38:05.327 --> 02:38:08.290]  They always go in unpredictable ways.
[02:38:08.290 --> 02:38:11.913]  The World Economic Forum has started a war.
[02:38:11.913 --> 02:38:14.415]  At this point, they will not be able to turn it off.
[02:38:14.415 --> 02:38:16.497]  And at some point, people will target them.
[02:38:16.497 --> 02:38:19.459]  I'm not saying to target them, obviously.
[02:38:19.459 --> 02:38:21.821]  But the world's a two-way street.
[02:38:21.821 --> 02:38:23.282]  Yeah, the world is a two-way street.
[02:38:23.282 --> 02:38:24.523]  It's going to get kinetic.
[02:38:24.523 --> 02:38:26.385]  It's already kinetic on us.
[02:38:26.385 --> 02:38:29.508]  And it's going to get way out of control.
[02:38:29.508 --> 02:38:30.749]  Because that's what wars do.
[02:38:32.196 --> 02:38:37.378]  Well look at the left defunding police and now you see leftist politicians on a daily basis being murdered in their homes.
[02:38:37.378 --> 02:38:42.100]  Bishops, congress people, mayors, I mean it's every day they're being murdered.
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:43.841]  What did they think was going to happen?
[02:38:43.841 --> 02:38:45.202]  Like they're going to cut police to kill us?
[02:38:45.202 --> 02:38:46.422]  What happens to them?
[02:38:46.422 --> 02:38:49.124]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:38:49.124 --> 02:38:51.365]  Why do they think they're immune from what they do?
[02:38:51.365 --> 02:38:54.086]  Like anybody that has chivalry, chivalry's not a wimpy thing.
[02:38:54.086 --> 02:38:56.047]  You're like, let's leave the women and children out of this.
[02:38:56.767 --> 02:38:58.488]  They're like, oh, you're wimpy, we'll get rid of chivalry.
[02:38:58.488 --> 02:39:00.029]  No, we don't want women and children targeted.
[02:39:00.029 --> 02:39:02.970]  Why do they think getting rid of chivalry is so cool?
[02:39:02.970 --> 02:39:05.792]  Wimps didn't develop chivalry, they did it because they were honorable.
[02:39:05.792 --> 02:39:06.972]  Right, right.
[02:39:06.972 --> 02:39:17.638]  Well, the people that we're fighting against, they're clearly setting conditions for global famine and setting conditions for a massive migration into Europe and the United States.
[02:39:17.638 --> 02:39:21.640]  The migration into Europe is almost complete, but it's still ongoing.
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:23.941]  For instance, I was in Morocco about a year and a half ago with
[02:39:24.341 --> 02:39:27.862]  With Chuck Colton, the famous war correspondent friend of mine.
[02:39:27.862 --> 02:39:33.503]  And you can see there's two actually EU cities, Spanish cities in Africa.
[02:39:33.503 --> 02:39:35.284]  They're in Ceuta and Melilla.
[02:39:35.284 --> 02:39:36.564]  They're in Morocco.
[02:39:36.564 --> 02:39:40.885]  And so you'll see there's actually Spanish cities in Morocco, right?
[02:39:40.885 --> 02:39:45.286]  And so if you can get into Ceuta or Melilla, you're actually in the EU.
[02:39:45.286 --> 02:39:48.847]  So that's one of the places where migrants are weaponized, right?
[02:39:48.847 --> 02:39:52.828]  And so that whenever Morocco is upset with Spain or whatever, they'll push some more
[02:39:53.588 --> 02:39:55.128]  Migrants in De Souto.
[02:39:55.128 --> 02:39:55.589]  I went there.
[02:39:55.589 --> 02:39:57.249]  I went to the wall and whatnot.
[02:39:57.249 --> 02:39:59.709]  Likewise, over with Turkey and Greece.
[02:39:59.709 --> 02:40:04.191]  I was over on that wall with Chuck Colton on the Turkey-Greece border wall.
[02:40:04.191 --> 02:40:05.511]  They have a border wall there.
[02:40:05.511 --> 02:40:18.054]  Actually, the Greek, you might call them resistance, we went and sat at a little village cafe in Greece right next to the wall and these really swarthy men came in and they were clearly the resistance.
[02:40:18.054 --> 02:40:18.894]  They started showing us
[02:40:19.634 --> 02:40:22.296]  Photos of their weapons and their radios and whatnot.
[02:40:22.296 --> 02:40:30.182]  And they said, you know, our government is building that wall not to defend us against the migrants, but to defend the migrants against us.
[02:40:30.182 --> 02:40:32.343]  Because we're not letting them into Greece.
[02:40:32.343 --> 02:40:34.665]  We're not going to let them around our families.
[02:40:34.665 --> 02:40:36.306]  They're cutting down the trees.
[02:40:36.306 --> 02:40:42.751]  For instance, they complained about cutting down these olive trees that are 300 years old.
[02:40:42.751 --> 02:40:44.832]  You won't believe how many wars are started over trees.
[02:40:44.832 --> 02:40:45.513]  People love them.
[02:40:46.818 --> 02:40:47.978]  People love those trees.
[02:40:47.978 --> 02:40:49.259]  Oh, they're 300 years old?
[02:40:49.259 --> 02:40:50.119]  Olive trees, you know?
[02:40:50.119 --> 02:40:56.701]  When I was in Afghanistan, I was with the British, and we were taking sniper fire every day.
[02:40:56.701 --> 02:40:58.521]  And I was like, why can't we kill the sniper?
[02:40:58.521 --> 02:41:02.242]  And we were intercepting his ICOMs.
[02:41:02.242 --> 02:41:03.122]  It's like, we know where he's at.
[02:41:03.122 --> 02:41:04.522]  He's doing ICOMs, right?
[02:41:04.522 --> 02:41:13.245]  And the reason he was shooting at us, he had gone to Pakistan and bought a sniper rifle, because the British had cut down some of his fruit trees, pomegranates.
[02:41:13.245 --> 02:41:14.045]  I remember reading about Iraq.
[02:41:14.545 --> 02:41:19.606]  When the military cut out a bunch of trees on the Tigris-Euphrates, that creates a whole uprising.
[02:41:19.606 --> 02:41:21.347]  Oh, they'll straight up go to war for it.
[02:41:21.347 --> 02:41:34.711]  And finally, actually, one of the soldiers in the unit that I was with, it was a small, it was in Sangin, actually, the most dangerous district in all of Afghanistan, out of about 400 districts, and one of the British got shot in the head, he was killed.
[02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:35.531]  I mean, by that sniper.
[02:41:35.731 --> 02:41:39.933]  I mean, at one point I was like, why don't we pay for the tree or kill him?
[02:41:39.933 --> 02:41:43.414]  I mean, we cut down these trees for fields of fire, the British did, right?
[02:41:43.414 --> 02:41:46.856]  And I said, why don't we just pay for the trees or kill him?
[02:41:46.856 --> 02:41:48.257]  One or the other, he's going to kill us.
[02:41:48.257 --> 02:41:50.517]  And finally he killed one of the soldiers.
[02:41:50.517 --> 02:42:02.323]  And the British commander was like, we would like to pay for the trees, and we offered to pay for the trees, but there's a schedule back in London about how much you're able to pay for the trees, and it's not making him happy.
[02:42:02.323 --> 02:42:03.183]  It's the same thing.
[02:42:03.183 --> 02:42:04.644]  Those trees are their livelihood.
[02:42:05.444 --> 02:42:08.925]  Just like the Dutch are ready to go to war because they're taking their cows and killing them.
[02:42:08.925 --> 02:42:16.947]  Straight up, and that's why Stalin went for the kulaks, he went for the farmers and had the whole lot of more in 1932-33.
[02:42:16.947 --> 02:42:21.047]  He was going after the farmers.
[02:42:21.047 --> 02:42:25.408]  Why did this thing just happen in East Palestine and Ohio?
[02:42:25.408 --> 02:42:28.749]  I asked Sam Faddis, I just called him when I was in the Green Room.
[02:42:28.749 --> 02:42:29.949]  What is going on?
[02:42:29.949 --> 02:42:31.190]  He's a retired CIA guy.
[02:42:33.189 --> 02:42:35.310]  Why did this happen in East Palestine?
[02:42:35.310 --> 02:42:36.591]  I mean, was it the rivers?
[02:42:36.591 --> 02:42:37.691]  Was it what?
[02:42:37.691 --> 02:42:49.876]  And I don't know, but I also just called a journalist who's up there now, Jonathan, he might be watching, and his theory is that it's a big, highly, it's Amish farmland.
[02:42:49.876 --> 02:42:50.536]  That's his theory.
[02:42:50.536 --> 02:42:53.858]  Come back, let's talk about the situation in Ohio straight ahead with our great guest.
[02:42:58.126 --> 02:43:00.847]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:43:00.847 --> 02:43:05.729]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:43:05.729 --> 02:43:11.032]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[02:43:11.032 --> 02:43:21.056]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[02:44:05.094 --> 02:44:12.376]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:44:12.376 --> 02:44:15.917]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:44:15.917 --> 02:44:19.778]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors.
[02:44:20.698 --> 02:44:33.167]  For the next 15 days, to flatten the curve, I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[02:44:33.167 --> 02:44:43.594]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:44:43.594 --> 02:44:45.595]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:44:47.117 --> 02:44:57.101]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra that will move your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:44:57.101 --> 02:45:01.043]  I just want to say about diet force.
[02:45:01.043 --> 02:45:02.884]  Diet force is amazing.
[02:45:02.884 --> 02:45:05.145]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:45:05.145 --> 02:45:08.486]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:45:08.486 --> 02:45:11.068]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[02:45:12.623 --> 02:45:17.411]  Under my peck, my belly, I'm just taking diet pills, two tablets a day.
[02:45:17.411 --> 02:45:19.635]  Man, if you're like struggling to get...

[02:46:58.836 --> 02:47:04.744]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:47:12.646 --> 02:47:17.908]  Final segment with Michael Yond, then Drew Hernandez takes over in the fourth hour out of Owens Shore at 3 p.m.
[02:47:17.908 --> 02:47:19.169]  Central, The War Room.
[02:47:19.169 --> 02:47:36.777]  But you were explaining a Carver Matrix and a military training, basically hit list of priority targets, primary targets, and explaining looking at this, it's obvious warfare, and I even have the Wall Street Journal, everybody admitting, the government admits, power stations, record levels, food processing, farms, everything.
[02:47:36.777 --> 02:47:40.599]  And you talk about Ohio, just looking at that, what does your training tell you?
[02:47:42.025 --> 02:47:43.106]  Sabotage.
[02:47:43.106 --> 02:47:49.655]  You know, as somebody who trained to parachute into Poland and do sabotage, I mean, it just reeks of sabotage.
[02:47:49.655 --> 02:47:53.520]  One question I have is, why East Palestine?
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:57.966]  Because, you know, in the Carver Matrix, something called the Carver Matrix, which is a planning tool for sabotage,
[02:47:58.767 --> 02:47:59.447]  We're good to go.
[02:48:20.558 --> 02:48:24.483]  As in business, the least amount of resources to get the most effect, right?
[02:48:24.483 --> 02:48:28.268]  And so, why East Palestine if it was, in fact, an attack?
[02:48:28.268 --> 02:48:29.650]  Which I think that it was.
[02:48:29.650 --> 02:48:31.472]  That's my sense, anyway.
[02:48:31.472 --> 02:48:33.214]  And, why?
[02:48:33.214 --> 02:48:36.418]  So, you know, I was talking... We know Antifa's attacking railways everywhere.
[02:48:36.418 --> 02:48:37.119]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:38.741 --> 02:48:41.723]  But why East Palestine?
[02:48:41.723 --> 02:48:45.124]  Because you could have attacked it in other places, the same train, right?
[02:48:45.124 --> 02:48:47.486]  Was it just accidentally that it happened there?
[02:48:47.486 --> 02:48:50.007]  You know, the fire had started earlier.
[02:48:50.007 --> 02:48:52.468]  But you know, that is heavy Amish territory.
[02:48:53.809 --> 02:49:14.997]  Dutch I mean Amish farm territory so maybe I don't know I'm just floating an idea I don't know why they would have done it there the waterways what it could have been targeting the farmers there that in particular the Amish whom we seen have been in the news quite a lot lately for you know because farmers will tend to be farmers that's why I get along with farmers and
[02:49:15.277 --> 02:49:20.140]  Every country I go to, some of the first people I go to to pick up atmospherics is farmers.
[02:49:20.140 --> 02:49:21.120]  I go to the farmers.
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.782]  Because I get along with farmers in every... I get along with Taliban farmers.
[02:49:24.782 --> 02:49:30.045]  I get along with... Well, Thomas Jefferson said it shouldn't be lawyers or politicians, it should be farmers.
[02:49:30.045 --> 02:49:32.166]  He said farmers are our civilization.
[02:49:32.166 --> 02:49:33.447]  Did he say that?
[02:49:33.447 --> 02:49:33.827]  Brilliant.
[02:49:33.827 --> 02:49:35.067]  I'm paraphrasing him, but yeah.
[02:49:35.067 --> 02:49:37.709]  Oh, I mean... He said yeoman farmers should fill Congress.
[02:49:40.045 --> 02:49:46.151]  Every, literally every country I go to, when I'm trying to pick up atmospherics, I'm like, okay, let's go talk with some farmers, you know?
[02:49:46.151 --> 02:49:48.393]  Because that's where you'll get a pulse, right?
[02:49:48.393 --> 02:49:50.955]  And I get along with farmers in every culture.
[02:49:50.955 --> 02:49:52.997]  Even Taliban farmers I get along with.
[02:49:52.997 --> 02:49:56.401]  You know, I could tell you a lot of Taliban farmer stories.
[02:49:56.401 --> 02:49:59.944]  But the bottom line is, why did it happen in East Palestine?
[02:49:59.944 --> 02:50:03.367]  Were our Amish farmers being targeted?
[02:50:04.289 --> 02:50:05.430]  I don't know.
[02:50:05.430 --> 02:50:08.973]  I've got to head over to Netherlands and then I may head back over there.
[02:50:08.973 --> 02:50:10.614]  Or I may head to Ukraine after that.
[02:50:10.614 --> 02:50:12.235]  But this is gnawing on me.
[02:50:12.235 --> 02:50:13.777]  Maybe I'll have to send somebody up there.
[02:50:13.777 --> 02:50:14.617]  Well, they're both close.
[02:50:14.617 --> 02:50:18.360]  Maybe go to Ukraine first and then to the Netherlands.
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:20.762]  I've got to go to Netherlands because I've got to go on with Jordan Peterson.
[02:50:20.762 --> 02:50:23.384]  You've got to promise to come on when you're in Ukraine.
[02:50:23.384 --> 02:50:26.107]  Either way, every country I go to, which is a lot.
[02:50:27.284 --> 02:50:28.625]  Wow, keep going.
[02:50:28.625 --> 02:50:31.486]  Oh, well, yeah, I mean, so why did that happen there?
[02:50:31.486 --> 02:50:35.387]  Anyway, Carver Matrix, you see so many of these plants that are being hit.
[02:50:35.387 --> 02:50:40.989]  You see so many interruptions that are happening with electrical grid or whatnot.
[02:50:40.989 --> 02:50:49.772]  And this is something that people who've studied sabotage and these sorts of campaigns for years have often been concerned about with the United States.
[02:50:49.772 --> 02:50:53.133]  We're highly vulnerable because we are an open society.
[02:50:53.133 --> 02:50:53.494]  I mean, as
[02:50:54.734 --> 02:51:00.877]  As Matt Bracken, whom you know, he went to Darien Gap with me recently, a great former SEAL officer.
[02:51:00.877 --> 02:51:02.438]  He was great in the jungle.
[02:51:02.438 --> 02:51:09.081]  He talked about the other day, you know, if you want to take out your neighbor's electricity, you just shoot his transformer on his power pole.
[02:51:09.081 --> 02:51:11.162]  I mean, that's how vulnerable we are, right?
[02:51:11.162 --> 02:51:14.804]  We're highly vulnerable to sabotage and
[02:51:15.484 --> 02:51:17.025]  Food in particular.
[02:51:17.025 --> 02:51:18.986]  Now, in many ways, we're very resilient.
[02:51:18.986 --> 02:51:21.568]  In other ways, we're very non-resilient.
[02:51:21.568 --> 02:51:32.515]  If you have big-level players that can take out your energy and your pipelines and that sort of thing, like Nord Stream, take out your ability to hit us with bureaucratic obstacles.
[02:51:32.515 --> 02:51:42.162]  This is one of the things they're doing with the Dutch and the Germans and the Belgians, hitting them with bureaucratic obstacles, adding more cost and time and money to their operations.
[02:51:42.162 --> 02:51:45.224]  And again, what's the endgame of the ruling class who want to make the people poor?
[02:51:46.585 --> 02:51:49.648]  Take control of the food supply for starters.
[02:51:49.648 --> 02:51:55.394]  And with this, remember, these all play into a comprehensive war strategy that they openly talk about.
[02:51:55.394 --> 02:51:58.057]  Remember, evil will tell you what it's going to do.
[02:51:58.057 --> 02:51:58.878]  Mein Kampf.
[02:51:58.878 --> 02:52:00.540]  I mean, he wrote it in a book, right?
[02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:05.164]  I mean, evil will sit there and tell you, I'm going to burn down your house, and then it'll go and burn down your house.
[02:52:05.805 --> 02:52:13.432]  The World Economic Forum, remember, the World Economic Forum and the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, are co-sanguinated.
[02:52:13.432 --> 02:52:14.853]  They are inseparable.
[02:52:14.853 --> 02:52:17.475]  You can't talk about them as if they joined forces.
[02:52:17.475 --> 02:52:19.457]  They are one, right?
[02:52:19.457 --> 02:52:23.320]  They may break up later and fight each other, but they operate as one.
[02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:24.581]  They have the same mission.
[02:52:25.462 --> 02:52:28.984]  Oh yeah, same mission, and they're just totally entwined, right?
[02:52:28.984 --> 02:52:31.626]  The Dutch government, as an example, is completely captured.
[02:52:31.626 --> 02:52:33.247]  It is utterly captured.
[02:52:33.247 --> 02:52:39.852]  And so, one of the things that they'll first offer to do, which they offer to the United States, is to buy the farms, right?
[02:52:39.852 --> 02:52:43.054]  Or to buy the Dutch farmers, or the Germans, right?
[02:52:43.054 --> 02:52:44.215]  Or the British.
[02:52:44.215 --> 02:52:52.100]  Interestingly, when I was in Netherlands last year, you know, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has put hundreds of millions of dollars into something called PICNIC.
[02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:53.221]  Have you heard of that?
[02:52:53.221 --> 02:52:54.241]  Food distribution?
[02:52:54.241 --> 02:52:55.282]  One of them burned down when I was there.
[02:52:55.322 --> 02:52:58.703]  I was about to say, what happens when the people start using the same tactics?
[02:52:58.703 --> 02:52:59.403]  And that's the key.
[02:52:59.403 --> 02:53:00.664]  I've never called for violence.
[02:53:00.664 --> 02:53:03.285]  What I've done is identify the globals, their operations.
[02:53:03.285 --> 02:53:06.266]  I'm just going to let the public decide what they want to do.
[02:53:18.610 --> 02:53:19.490]  Right.
[02:53:19.490 --> 02:53:27.912]  Ultimately, I think the World Economic Forum members are getting antsy as more and more of them realize, hey, we're a bunch of rich people and we're highly vulnerable.
[02:53:27.912 --> 02:53:30.532]  By the way, I watch body language.
[02:53:30.532 --> 02:53:32.493]  I've been watching Klaus Schwab for 20 years.
[02:53:32.493 --> 02:53:34.273]  He looks scared now.
[02:53:34.273 --> 02:53:36.753]  And all their body language does not look confident.
[02:53:36.753 --> 02:53:37.173]  He does.
[02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:41.534]  Did you see how he looked when Masako Kanaha, the Japanese journalist, approached him?
[02:53:41.534 --> 02:53:42.714]  Oh, yeah.
[02:53:42.714 --> 02:53:43.575]  He looked, actually.
[02:53:43.575 --> 02:53:45.215]  What did you think about his body language then?
[02:53:46.926 --> 02:53:49.127]  Just isolated, alone.
[02:53:49.127 --> 02:53:49.928]  Yeah.
[02:53:49.928 --> 02:53:50.928]  He was naked.
[02:53:50.928 --> 02:53:52.729]  No real security or anything.
[02:53:52.729 --> 02:53:57.391]  If he's such a heavy hitter... And the same with Greta Thunberg.
[02:53:57.391 --> 02:53:58.552]  She was there.
[02:53:58.552 --> 02:54:00.553]  And Misako was there and followed her.
[02:54:00.553 --> 02:54:02.374]  She got lost on the way to the train station.
[02:54:02.374 --> 02:54:03.755]  Greta could not find her.
[02:54:03.755 --> 02:54:05.676]  There was nobody there to escort her.
[02:54:05.676 --> 02:54:06.916]  They were just lost and down.
[02:54:06.916 --> 02:54:08.097]  I think it's a combination.
[02:54:08.097 --> 02:54:09.137]  They're just front people.
[02:54:09.137 --> 02:54:09.337]  I agree.
[02:54:09.337 --> 02:54:10.698]  They're not as powerful.
[02:54:10.698 --> 02:54:13.640]  They're not, you know, head cards in the deck.
[02:54:14.654 --> 02:54:19.040]  But they're also overconfident because they've never been opposed.
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:22.245]  So when they finally get opposed, they're like, whoa, someone's even talking to me.
[02:54:22.245 --> 02:54:23.727]  They don't know what to do.
[02:54:23.727 --> 02:54:25.108]  They're getting some pushback now.
[02:54:25.108 --> 02:54:28.072]  The curtain is being drawn back and people start to realize, hey.
[02:54:29.189 --> 02:54:35.455]  That guy, you know, you know, Switzerland, a lot of the Swiss are rising up against them as well, right?
[02:54:35.455 --> 02:54:37.237]  It's not like all the Swiss are behind this.
[02:54:37.237 --> 02:54:38.418]  They're not.
[02:54:38.418 --> 02:54:43.282]  Misako was down there interviewing Swiss farmers galore after this and before.
[02:54:43.282 --> 02:54:51.270]  And, you know, they are very angry about what's happening and why Davos is being used as their sort of little headquarters.
[02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:54.434]  Why do you think Davos has been so arrogant about being in control?
[02:54:54.434 --> 02:54:58.461]  Obviously it's a front group, but they're the spokesperson for the big corporations that are doing this.
[02:54:58.461 --> 02:55:02.266]  We penetrate the cabinets, we run your life, you'll own nothing, you'll like it.
[02:55:02.266 --> 02:55:04.370]  Why was he trying to act like a James Bond villain?
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:08.663]  I think he was in some way selected.
[02:55:08.663 --> 02:55:09.604]  Look at his accent.
[02:55:09.604 --> 02:55:14.269]  That accent that Klaus Schwab has grates on Americans in particular.
[02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:17.332]  I've explained this to people from other countries like Japan.
[02:55:17.332 --> 02:55:18.413]  You might not understand.
[02:55:18.413 --> 02:55:20.295]  It's not a German accent.
[02:55:20.295 --> 02:55:25.140]  It's that particular German accent is right out of a Nazi movie to us, right?
[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:26.963]  He is that villain.
[02:55:26.963 --> 02:55:28.165]  The things that he says.
[02:55:28.165 --> 02:55:29.688]  The way that he says them.
[02:55:29.688 --> 02:55:30.569]  The arrogance.
[02:55:30.569 --> 02:55:31.591]  We hate arrogance.
[02:55:31.591 --> 02:55:32.853]  We're Americans.
[02:55:32.853 --> 02:55:34.637]  We just don't like arrogance.
[02:55:34.637 --> 02:55:36.179]  Right?
[02:55:36.179 --> 02:55:37.582]  And arrogance is...
[02:55:38.536 --> 02:55:42.160]  Whenever you meet the WEF people, they're all arrogant.
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:44.322]  I haven't... They're so arrogant.
[02:55:44.322 --> 02:55:45.503]  Like, over the top arrogant.
[02:55:45.503 --> 02:55:48.306]  They think they're in charge, and they have been for now.
[02:55:48.306 --> 02:55:52.030]  But once this thing kicks off, and there's... Who's gonna guard them?
[02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:54.592]  They're not gonna be able to walk around freely anymore.
[02:55:54.592 --> 02:55:56.334]  They're not gonna be able to... Well, that's right.
[02:55:56.334 --> 02:55:58.076]  They're trying to create this grave for us.
[02:55:58.076 --> 02:55:58.957]  They've dug their own grave.
[02:56:00.066 --> 02:56:04.409]  Yeah, wars always get out of control and they never go the way that you think that they'll go.
[02:56:04.409 --> 02:56:15.056]  This thing that's kicking off now with Ukraine and, you know, CCP is obviously throwing in with Russia and, which obviously CCP is an enemy of the United States, hugely.
[02:56:15.056 --> 02:56:21.680]  One, actually, criticism I have is Trump, I thought he was a dove on CCP compared to what I would have been doing.
[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:25.541]  I mean, I like the way Trump stood up on the border.
[02:56:25.541 --> 02:56:30.902]  I'm disgusted with his stand on the vax, or the fake vax, the poison.
[02:56:30.902 --> 02:56:34.323]  But he did stand up to China, to some level, right?
[02:56:34.323 --> 02:56:35.103]  But not enough.
[02:56:35.103 --> 02:56:40.344]  China is a lethal enemy of the United States, and they love to demean their enemies.
[02:56:40.344 --> 02:56:42.484]  They love to dog king people.
[02:56:42.484 --> 02:56:44.565]  And that's clearly what they're doing.
[02:56:44.565 --> 02:56:47.805]  That's why they want to get rid of the Dalai Lama and everything else, right?
[02:56:47.805 --> 02:56:50.086]  The Chinese love to humiliate enemies.
[02:56:51.857 --> 02:56:55.239]  Michael Yon, in closing, how do people find your amazing reporting?
[02:56:55.239 --> 02:57:11.008]  I'm on Locals.com, Michael Yon, my last name is Yon, Yankee Oscar November, and I'm on Twitter, and Michael underscore Yon, Yankee Oscar November, and I'm on Getter, so it's Michael Yon 1776 on Getter, and I publish on Locals every day.
[02:57:14.892 --> 02:57:16.373]  Well, it's incredible the stuff you've done.
[02:57:16.373 --> 02:57:18.415]  I hope you'll come back soon now that you live in Texas.
[02:57:18.415 --> 02:57:19.876]  Absolutely.
[02:57:19.876 --> 02:57:21.017]  And you contact us.
[02:57:21.017 --> 02:57:25.221]  I don't want to bug you, but when you're ready from Ukraine or ready for the Netherlands, you call us.
[02:57:25.221 --> 02:57:25.641]  You're on.
[02:57:25.641 --> 02:57:25.981]  Bam.
[02:57:25.981 --> 02:57:27.342]  I want to see what's happening.
[02:57:27.342 --> 02:57:29.044]  I'll be in Netherlands next week.
[02:57:29.044 --> 02:57:29.644]  We can do it.
[02:57:29.644 --> 02:57:30.005]  Next week.
[02:57:30.005 --> 02:57:30.445]  Let's do it.
[02:57:30.445 --> 02:57:31.126]  Thank you, sir.
[02:57:31.126 --> 02:57:31.526]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:31.526 --> 02:57:32.267]  Thank you.
[02:57:32.267 --> 02:57:32.687]  All right.
[02:57:32.687 --> 02:57:33.488]  I'm going to come back.
[02:57:33.488 --> 02:57:39.493]  It's the final news and hand the baton to the great, the great Drew Hernandez.
[02:57:39.493 --> 02:57:40.173]  Straight ahead.
[02:57:40.173 --> 02:57:41.134]  Hour number four.
[02:57:41.134 --> 02:57:42.215]  Only two minutes away.
[02:57:42.215 --> 02:57:42.675]  Stay with us.
[02:57:42.675 --> 02:57:43.156]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:49.904 --> 02:57:59.611]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[02:57:59.611 --> 02:58:03.294]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.

[02:58:20.046 --> 02:58:21.766]  Cardiovascular, critical.

[02:58:38.935 --> 02:58:42.277]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[02:58:42.277 --> 02:58:44.518]  But now, I signed the last books, you can get them right now.
[02:58:48.194 --> 02:58:54.599]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[02:58:54.599 --> 02:58:59.243]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[02:58:59.243 --> 02:59:02.025]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[02:59:02.025 --> 02:59:04.267]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[02:59:04.267 --> 02:59:11.012]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[02:59:11.012 --> 02:59:14.395]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[02:59:15.015 --> 02:59:25.706]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:59:36.738 --> 02:59:43.043]  At InfoWarsStore.com under the banner of InfoWarsMD.
[02:59:43.043 --> 02:59:46.585]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:59:46.585 --> 02:59:49.888]  InfoWarsMD.
[02:59:49.888 --> 02:59:54.491]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:54.491 --> 02:59:55.792]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.847 --> 03:00:07.773]  In 1863, Republican President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves held in the Confederate States.
[03:00:07.773 --> 03:00:17.019]  The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution took effect in December 1865, and finally ended slavery throughout the United States.
[03:00:17.019 --> 03:00:19.961]  That year, the Ku Klux Klan was founded.
[03:00:19.961 --> 03:00:27.186]  Historian Eric Foner observed that basically, the Klan was the military muscle behind the agenda of the Democratic Party.
[03:00:28.507 --> 03:00:28.867]  We're good.
[03:00:44.694 --> 03:00:49.078]  There are a lot of people who wrote these eulogies for Senator Burr in the newspapers, and I read a bunch of them.
[03:01:07.345 --> 03:01:11.967]  They mentioned that he once had a fleeting association with a Ku Klux Klan.
[03:01:11.967 --> 03:01:12.907]  And what does that mean?
[03:01:12.907 --> 03:01:14.448]  I'll tell you what it means.
[03:01:14.448 --> 03:01:17.189]  He was a country boy from the hills and hollows of West Virginia.
[03:01:17.189 --> 03:01:19.110]  He was trying to get elected.
[03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:24.813]  He was fiercely devoted, as you've all heard, to his principles.
[03:01:24.813 --> 03:01:34.717]  Even once he became power, he always spoke truth to power, standing up for the people he proudly was part of.
[03:01:35.247 --> 03:01:38.108]  You know folks, lynching is pure terror.
[03:01:38.108 --> 03:01:42.849]  Enforcing the lie that not everyone belongs in America and not everyone is created equal.
[03:01:42.849 --> 03:01:47.811]  Pure terror to systematically undermine hard-fought civil rights.
[03:01:47.811 --> 03:01:52.052]  Innocent men, women, children hung by a noose from trees.
[03:01:52.052 --> 03:01:55.213]  Bodies burned, drowned, castrated.
[03:01:55.213 --> 03:01:56.354]  They're crimes.
[03:01:56.354 --> 03:01:57.814]  Trying to vote.
[03:01:57.814 --> 03:01:58.774]  Trying to go to school.
[03:01:58.774 --> 03:02:00.295]  Trying to own a business.
[03:02:00.295 --> 03:02:02.896]  Lynched for simply being black.
[03:02:02.896 --> 03:02:03.476]  Nothing more.
[03:02:04.295 --> 03:02:10.023]  With white crowds, white families gathered to celebrate the spectacle.
[03:02:10.023 --> 03:02:14.869]  Taking pictures of the bodies and mailing them my postcards.
[03:02:14.869 --> 03:02:16.512]  Hard to believe, but that's what was done.
[03:02:17.304 --> 03:02:18.865]  And some people still want to do that.
[03:02:18.865 --> 03:02:23.508]  These are the innocent lives taken during another tragic mass shooting in America this year.
[03:02:23.508 --> 03:02:26.811]  Arielle Anderson, Brian Frazier, and Alexandria Verner.
[03:02:26.811 --> 03:02:30.714]  Police identify the gunman as 43-year-old Anthony Dwayne McCray.
[03:02:30.714 --> 03:02:36.278]  After an hours-long manhunt, police say he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a location off campus.
[03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:39.400]  The FBI says McCray suffered from mental health issues.
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:45.284]  Detectives found a three-page note on him listing places in Michigan, Colorado, and New Jersey he also wanted to attack.
[03:02:45.764 --> 03:02:46.824]  Soros D.A.
[03:02:46.824 --> 03:02:52.306]  did what they do and reduced the charges and let this guy walk out so he could buy a gun.
[03:02:52.306 --> 03:02:54.527]  So I dug into the prosecutor, because you know that's what I'm going to do.
[03:02:54.527 --> 03:03:01.269]  It's Ingram County Prosecutor Carol Seaman, who just retired recently, confirmed George Soros back D.A.
[03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:06.670]  So her official policy was to drop mandatory prison sentences for felony firearm charges.
[03:03:06.670 --> 03:03:08.111]  That's what she did.
[03:03:08.111 --> 03:03:09.431]  And this is what happened.
[03:03:09.431 --> 03:03:15.073]  This is the clearest example I've found yet, right, of woke criminal justice causing
[03:03:16.773 --> 03:03:17.593]  A mass shooting.
[03:03:17.593 --> 03:03:32.139]  I will defend myself from violent KKK, black supremacist, Antifa, or anybody else that tries to hurt my family, and I will put down as many people as I have to to protect my family, and no more.
[03:03:32.139 --> 03:03:35.361]  Joseph Martinez, age 8.
[03:03:35.361 --> 03:03:37.161]  Arthur Martinez, age 13.
[03:03:37.161 --> 03:03:45.945]  Yeah, the Ku Klux Klan and their federal Gestapo controllers are not welcome here in Central Texas, where the real patriots reside!
[03:03:48.547 --> 03:03:55.731]  For two weeks they've had fake news articles everywhere saying that I'm saying go mow down black people.
[03:03:55.731 --> 03:03:58.693]  Sorry, that's the new Black Panther Party saying that.
[03:03:58.693 --> 03:04:06.017]  And that's Chris Cuomo saying he wanted to kill everybody, kill everybody at CNN, go on a mass shooting rampage, but he decided not to.
[03:04:06.017 --> 03:04:07.118]  I wasn't gonna kill everybody.
[03:04:07.658 --> 03:04:08.579]  Including myself.
[03:04:08.579 --> 03:04:09.780]  Things can consume you.
[03:04:09.780 --> 03:04:11.141]  Italians are so passionate.
[03:04:11.141 --> 03:04:14.783]  That's Fredo that's actually saying that, not me.
[03:04:14.783 --> 03:04:23.289]  Everybody that listens knows I want peace, I want justice, and the number one group in America being killed is black people.
[03:04:23.289 --> 03:04:25.230]  But, who's killing black people?
[03:04:25.230 --> 03:04:26.351]  Black people.
[03:04:26.351 --> 03:04:28.412]  Who's killing white people?
[03:04:28.412 --> 03:04:29.593]  Black people, statistically.
[03:04:30.723 --> 03:04:51.002]  And who's really killing the black people is Planned Parenthood and the left, where over 70% of black babies never get out of the womb, and when they do, their families are non-existent, so they turn to a life of crime, which all statistics show, whether you're black, white, or brown, if you come from a single-parent home, you are three to seven times more likely to end up in prison, be a violent criminal, or on drugs, or commit suicide.
[03:04:51.002 --> 03:04:51.663]  It's a fact!
[03:04:57.782 --> 03:05:00.184]  The cavalry has arrived.
[03:05:00.184 --> 03:05:13.593]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.
[03:05:13.593 --> 03:05:15.875]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[03:05:15.875 --> 03:05:20.939]  Well this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and
[03:05:21.539 --> 03:05:24.983]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.
[03:05:24.983 --> 03:05:32.211]  This is definitely the strongest, best bone broth out there, and your purchase supports the M4, a 360 win.
[03:05:32.211 --> 03:05:35.735]  If you've not experienced bone broth, even the regular ones have great effects.

[03:06:02.563 --> 03:06:10.306]  What's going on, ladies and gentlemen, Thought Criminals, Info Warriors here on Band.Video and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:10.306 --> 03:06:13.167]  I am your guest host here in the fourth hour.
[03:06:13.167 --> 03:06:14.548]  My name is Drew Hernandez.
[03:06:14.548 --> 03:06:20.770]  I'm host of Drew Hernandez Live exclusively on Rumble and also Frontlines with Drew Hernandez.
[03:06:20.770 --> 03:06:27.953]  You guys can find those great shows in the link in my bio on Twitter, Getter, Truth Social, and all that good stuff.
[03:06:27.953 --> 03:06:30.874]  Well, we got a lot to talk about today, you guys.
[03:06:30.874 --> 03:06:32.075]  It's not looking good.
[03:06:33.052 --> 03:06:39.857]  All right, and it's not looking good because things are just kind of happening by coincidence.
[03:06:39.857 --> 03:06:43.359]  There's no such thing as these conspiracy theories any longer.
[03:06:43.359 --> 03:06:49.723]  How many of these things that Alex Jones has come out and said for the past few decades that have come to fruition?
[03:06:49.723 --> 03:07:00.751]  Other truth speakers and seekers that have put the pieces together when it comes to the New World Order, when it comes to the global government of the world, when it comes to the Klaus Schwab's, the Bill Gates,
[03:07:01.610 --> 03:07:17.161]  World Health Organization, when it comes to these entities that want nothing but control and domination and power, on a global scale, not just in the United States, not just in Europe, but across the entire globe.
[03:07:17.161 --> 03:07:24.987]  I mean, maybe two, three decades ago when you would talk like this, you would get demonized, you would get slandered as a conspiracy theorist.
[03:07:26.122 --> 03:07:30.063]  You would get absolutely just trashed in the mainstream media.
[03:07:30.063 --> 03:07:32.584]  They try to do it even to this day.
[03:07:32.584 --> 03:07:43.627]  But what's problematic for the New World Order and what's problematic for the globalists and all these homicidal maniacs that want total world domination, that are out in the open, saying this stuff.
[03:07:43.627 --> 03:07:46.148]  Okay, Klaus Schwab, they talk about mastering the universe.
[03:07:47.026 --> 03:07:52.190]  Mastering the technologies of today and tomorrow so they can master the future.
[03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:57.795]  These people are open about what they want to do and it's for a very specific reason.
[03:07:58.570 --> 03:08:01.032]  And it's not because it's happening by design.
[03:08:01.032 --> 03:08:08.076]  It's not just some kind of coincidence where everything is falling together, where there's evil in the world and there's bad people in the world.
[03:08:08.076 --> 03:08:18.884]  Yes, there is absolute evil in the world, but people need to quite literally understand that you're dealing with a strategic agenda that has been in development that predates
[03:08:19.564 --> 03:08:25.129]  Alex Jones that predates any of the trailblazers that have warned of a New World Order.
[03:08:25.129 --> 03:08:30.433]  That it predates anyone that has been openly vocal about these things.
[03:08:30.433 --> 03:08:32.375]  You're living in the end times ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:32.375 --> 03:08:36.018]  These are days of biblical proportions.
[03:08:36.018 --> 03:08:40.642]  Where you're watching mass countries move in unison just like the Bible said they would.
[03:08:41.604 --> 03:09:00.373]  When you're watching entities and individuals like Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum entities of our current generation right now that are all moving in unison, pushing us further and further and further and further into the epicenter of what many call the end of the world.
[03:09:00.373 --> 03:09:05.776]  But the Bible clearly calls the end times, which the epicenter is the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[03:09:05.776 --> 03:09:11.179]  Now, what comes before that is the end, the advent of the Antichrist.
[03:09:12.179 --> 03:09:19.383]  The false prophet that is alongside of him, that is all energized and empowered by Satan himself.
[03:09:19.383 --> 03:09:30.829]  It is what theologians and Bible scholars have deemed the unholy trinity that you see during the seven-year tribulation just before the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[03:09:31.934 --> 03:09:45.936]  And the ultimate showdown in Armageddon, which is not just an event, the Valley of Megiddo in Israel, Armageddon is an actual place where Christ is going to come back, slaughter many that are all opposing him, that side with the Antichrist.
[03:09:45.936 --> 03:09:56.018]  It's the ultimate showdown that the Bible has talked about where global governments will unify together for one purpose and one purpose only.
[03:09:56.018 --> 03:10:00.059]  And that's to defy and oppose and make war with God.
[03:10:00.848 --> 03:10:15.722]  The Bible says this in Psalms chapter 2 as well, that the world governments, these governments of the world, they all unify together, and they stick their noses to the sky, and they mock God, and they want to fight God, they want to make war with God, in a proud, very pompous mentality.
[03:10:15.722 --> 03:10:18.065]  That's what you're seeing unfold right now.
[03:10:18.065 --> 03:10:22.009]  The Bible says that God turns around and looks down upon them, and He laughs.
[03:10:23.763 --> 03:10:33.288]  Now the reason why I'm opening up this show today this way is because I know that all the info warriors out there know exactly what I'm talking about, but I want to encourage you guys.
[03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:43.693]  The only way we get this information out is the audience we have today, the audience we have right now, that has been blessed by God to breach the matrix, get unplugged,
[03:10:44.412 --> 03:10:48.774]  Be born again and see the truth of the reality that we actually live in.
[03:10:48.774 --> 03:11:04.761]  For God's sake, these people want to jack you into a virtual reality metaverse where you have some kind of centralized economy and they have access to your thoughts and everything that you're thinking so they can manipulate and control every aspect of your psyche and your life.
[03:11:04.761 --> 03:11:07.883]  That is the age that you live in right now.
[03:11:08.675 --> 03:11:18.263]  This isn't just technology that they're, you know, kind of speculating might exist in the next 10 years, or they're just thinking, I don't know, what's the world going to be like in 2050?
[03:11:18.263 --> 03:11:21.545]  Or what's the world going to be like in 2090?
[03:11:21.545 --> 03:11:26.349]  These people are talking about this, they just had the World Government Summit in Dubai.
[03:11:26.349 --> 03:11:32.294]  And like I said, when I opened the show, Klaus Schwab is saying we need to master these technologies now, because they know they need to master the future.
[03:11:33.536 --> 03:11:49.167]  So I talk like this and I communicate like this because I know people need to understand the only way that we win and the only way that we truly get an edge up against these people is if we, A, understand that if God be for us, who could be against us?
[03:11:49.167 --> 03:11:51.969]  We're empowered by God, empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[03:11:51.969 --> 03:11:59.434]  We are the ones that have the ability to take on such evil in our world on a global scale.
[03:11:59.434 --> 03:12:02.937]  If we think we could do this on our own and our own strength, it's never going to happen.
[03:12:03.655 --> 03:12:08.938]  We will get nowhere, we will go nowhere, and a lot of people are truly waking up to that reality.
[03:12:08.938 --> 03:12:10.198]  That's the real Great Awakening.
[03:12:10.198 --> 03:12:12.219]  You want to talk about a Great Awakening?
[03:12:12.219 --> 03:12:19.082]  It's people, yes, waking up to the reality that they're being lied to, but the ultimate red pill is the Christ pill.
[03:12:19.082 --> 03:12:26.086]  Born again, eyes open, you're open to the reality that you all live in, and we see the world for what it truly is.
[03:12:27.515 --> 03:12:33.237]  And right now we're moving closer and closer and closer to these end times events.
[03:12:33.237 --> 03:12:34.778]  We're not in the Tribulation.
[03:12:34.778 --> 03:12:39.959]  The Bible makes it very clear that the Antichrist will be revealed.
[03:12:39.959 --> 03:12:48.122]  The Bible says there will be a third Jewish temple established where the Temple Mount currently is right now in Jerusalem.
[03:12:48.122 --> 03:12:52.684]  And that when the Tribulation does come, he will enter that third temple.
[03:12:53.473 --> 03:12:58.814]  And he will sit down in the Holy of Holies and he will declare himself to be God.
[03:12:58.814 --> 03:13:01.115]  That has not happened yet.
[03:13:01.115 --> 03:13:19.779]  But, but the Bible is very clear, Christ made it very clear, God in human flesh, when he's walking the earth in his ministry for the short time that he was there in human flesh before he was crucified and rose and ascended back into heaven, that we would see birth pains.
[03:13:20.686 --> 03:13:29.437]  That we would see wars, rumors of wars, pestilences, earthquakes, natural disasters, the love of many would grow cold.
[03:13:29.437 --> 03:13:37.388]  If that's not happening right now and you cannot see that or identify that, not just in the United States, ladies and gentlemen and all my friends watching,
[03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:57.436]  But across the entire world, where tyranny is reigning, and Christ alluded to that as well when it came to the end times, and the signs of the times, that lawlessness would abound, not just defunding the police, it's actual lawlessness becoming the norm in societies.
[03:13:57.436 --> 03:14:06.881]  I'll just take the United States as an example right now, where we live in a current generation right now, where they're trying to normalize the mutilization of the genitals of little kids,
[03:14:07.774 --> 03:14:20.623]  If a little boy decides that he's not a girl at the age of six, excuse me, he's not a boy at the age of six and he believes he's a girl, without parental consent, he should be able to just chop his genitals up.
[03:14:20.623 --> 03:14:22.224]  And the same goes for little girls as well.
[03:14:22.224 --> 03:14:25.947]  See, that is where you are right now.
[03:14:25.947 --> 03:14:35.653]  So these things that have been very clear in the Bible 2,000 years ago, you're seeing in your reality currently right now.
[03:14:35.653 --> 03:14:36.074]  Right now!
[03:14:36.952 --> 03:14:42.217]  This is the state of the nation, state of the world, the state of the things that are going on right now.
[03:14:42.217 --> 03:14:45.220]  They're biblical proportions and people need to understand.
[03:14:45.220 --> 03:14:47.542]  And this is going to be a hot show right now.
[03:14:47.542 --> 03:14:50.745]  Because I want to challenge people throughout this entire hour.
[03:14:50.745 --> 03:14:52.046]  I really want to grill you.
[03:14:52.046 --> 03:14:54.008]  I want to challenge what you believe.
[03:14:54.008 --> 03:14:56.350]  I want to challenge what you know to be true.
[03:14:56.350 --> 03:14:58.452]  I want to challenge how far you're willing to go.
[03:14:58.452 --> 03:15:00.754]  And I'm not talking about violence.
[03:15:00.754 --> 03:15:02.456]  I'm not talking about hurting people.
[03:15:03.183 --> 03:15:20.037]  I'm talking about being bold, not being afraid anymore, not being afraid of getting cancelled, not being afraid of affiliating with the wrong people that have been cancelled and obliterated into the abyss of total censorship and being silenced into these digital gulags.
[03:15:20.037 --> 03:15:29.265]  I'm talking about being willing to come out as a truth seeker, truth speaker, to boldly just spit in the face of the devil at this point.
[03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:36.826]  Because we see these traitors that claim to be America first, that claim to be pro-humanity, but they're not.
[03:15:36.826 --> 03:15:44.934]  Not only by their rhetoric, they lie through their teeth, but their actions are far from what they're literally saying out their mouths.
[03:15:44.934 --> 03:15:48.397]  So we're going to talk about all of this when we come back from the break.
[03:15:48.397 --> 03:15:53.242]  So I need every single one of you guys to share these links no matter where you're watching.
[03:15:53.242 --> 03:15:54.723]  Blast them everywhere.
[03:15:54.723 --> 03:15:55.284]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.481 --> 03:16:16.634]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting Infowarstore.com right now and taking action.
[03:16:16.634 --> 03:16:21.577]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[03:16:21.837 --> 03:16:25.939]  To keep Info Wars on the air, we'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[03:16:25.939 --> 03:16:27.400]  They're coming for you and your family.
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:28.641]  They're coming for me.
[03:16:28.641 --> 03:16:29.882]  They're coming for the children.
[03:16:29.882 --> 03:16:32.463]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[03:16:32.463 --> 03:16:35.825]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[03:16:35.825 --> 03:16:37.146]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[03:16:37.386 --> 03:16:39.488]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[03:16:39.488 --> 03:16:44.915]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[03:16:44.915 --> 03:16:48.839]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[03:16:48.839 --> 03:16:50.041]  Let's do it together.
[03:16:50.041 --> 03:16:52.343]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[03:16:52.343 --> 03:16:56.168]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:56.168 --> 03:16:57.129]  Now take action now!
[03:16:57.629 --> 03:17:00.670]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[03:17:00.670 --> 03:17:09.013]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:17:09.013 --> 03:17:18.557]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[03:17:18.557 --> 03:17:24.019]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[03:17:24.019 --> 03:17:26.720]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:29.402]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[03:17:29.402 --> 03:17:34.565]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[03:17:34.565 --> 03:17:36.946]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram.
[03:17:36.946 --> 03:17:40.709]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[03:17:40.709 --> 03:17:43.370]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[03:17:43.370 --> 03:17:49.474]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[03:17:49.474 --> 03:17:53.857]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:53.857 --> 03:17:54.577]  A true 360 win.
[03:17:58.502 --> 03:18:01.623]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:18:01.623 --> 03:18:03.924]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:18:03.924 --> 03:18:07.846]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:18:07.846 --> 03:18:16.790]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:24.574]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:18:25.606 --> 03:18:28.488]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:18:28.488 --> 03:18:35.031]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:18:35.031 --> 03:18:35.972]  I know you spread the word.
[03:18:35.972 --> 03:18:36.892]  I know you pray for us.
[03:18:36.892 --> 03:18:37.493]  That's wonderful.
[03:18:37.493 --> 03:18:38.073]  Keep doing it.
[03:18:38.073 --> 03:18:45.117]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:18:45.117 --> 03:18:46.298]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:18:46.998 --> 03:18:51.302]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsware.com.
[03:18:51.302 --> 03:18:56.247]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:18:56.247 --> 03:18:57.248]  Please take action now.
[03:18:57.248 --> 03:18:59.450]  There is a war on for your mind.
[03:18:59.450 --> 03:19:01.252]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[03:19:01.252 --> 03:19:02.393]  This is an information war.
[03:19:03.294 --> 03:19:07.976]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[03:19:07.976 --> 03:19:17.179]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[03:19:17.179 --> 03:19:20.420]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[03:19:20.820 --> 03:19:28.088]  But we can't do it without funding, and we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system, and your family as well.
[03:19:28.088 --> 03:19:32.032]  You can also make straight donations at mfulworthstore.com, clicking on the big red banner.
[03:19:32.032 --> 03:19:35.275]  A one-time, a recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[03:19:35.275 --> 03:19:36.076]  We're non-violent.
[03:19:36.496 --> 03:19:44.419]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[03:19:44.419 --> 03:19:46.760]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:48.580]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[03:19:48.580 --> 03:19:49.701]  We're going over the top.
[03:19:49.701 --> 03:19:51.221]  But right now is the critical juncture.

[03:19:58.064 --> 03:20:02.685]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.685 --> 03:20:03.946]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:11.943 --> 03:20:19.685]  One of the things I'll say that we need to clearly define is who is who?
[03:20:19.685 --> 03:20:22.986]  Who is who?
[03:20:22.986 --> 03:20:36.950]  Because when you're talking about information warfare, when you're talking about cybernetic warfare, any form of warfare, and the Bible is big on this as well, wolves in sheep's clothing, the devil disguises himself as an angel of light.
[03:20:37.777 --> 03:21:04.834]  An individual that appears to be on your side, that appears to be for the cause, that appears to be on the right side that you claim to believe in, that they claim to have the same views, but you start to go a little further down that road, you start to get a little further down that fight, and you look around you, and before you know it, the same people that claimed to be fighting side by side with you in this fight, turn out to be on the other side!
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:07.441]  Turn it around, pointing their guns at you!
[03:21:07.441 --> 03:21:11.483]  This is a tale as old as time.
[03:21:11.483 --> 03:21:23.648]  But this society that we currently live in, right, this political, correct, afraid to hurt people's feelings society, is kind of quite literally how we all got here.
[03:21:24.682 --> 03:21:33.667]  Because if people are afraid to hurt someone's feelings, I don't care if they got a D next to their name or they got an R next to their name.
[03:21:33.667 --> 03:21:35.108]  They claim to be a leftist.
[03:21:35.108 --> 03:21:36.869]  They claim to be a conservative.
[03:21:36.869 --> 03:21:38.310]  Listen, I'll tell you something right now.
[03:21:38.310 --> 03:21:43.073]  The truth is going to universally piss everybody off.
[03:21:43.073 --> 03:21:44.654]  You want to know why?
[03:21:44.654 --> 03:21:52.258]  Because the truth doesn't consider, in any way, shape, or form, how you truly do feel about something.
[03:21:53.081 --> 03:21:59.003]  The truth will remain the truth regardless of how you feel any given day.
[03:21:59.003 --> 03:22:03.065]  And we always hear this argument where, oh, let's just be nice to people.
[03:22:03.065 --> 03:22:07.987]  Let's just make sure that we're sitting there and we're winning the other side.
[03:22:07.987 --> 03:22:20.892]  And when we're dealing with these groomers and people that want to mutilate the genitals of children, that want to dominate the world with a new world order, that want to take us all into some kind of AI-controlled mess,
[03:22:21.770 --> 03:22:23.392]  Grid system where we're controlled.
[03:22:23.392 --> 03:22:26.414]  They want mass lockdowns if they could have it.
[03:22:26.414 --> 03:22:30.618]  This is why Klaus Schwab says that China is the model.
[03:22:30.618 --> 03:22:38.545]  If they could have that form of some kind of zero COVID lockdown across the entire globe, these people would take it in an instant.
[03:22:40.635 --> 03:22:45.097]  You see, there are people in the movement that claim that they're fighting for freedom.
[03:22:45.097 --> 03:22:49.160]  There are people in the movement that claim that they're fighting against tyranny.
[03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:52.822]  There are people in the movement that sit there and they say, you know what?
[03:22:52.822 --> 03:22:54.102]  We're against this.
[03:22:54.102 --> 03:22:55.623]  We're against these enemies.
[03:22:55.623 --> 03:22:58.525]  We're against those that don't love America, when in reality...
[03:22:59.225 --> 03:23:08.509]  A lot of these people only talk like that because they just simply brand it that way, because they're wolves in sheep's clothing that don't really believe in what they're saying.
[03:23:08.509 --> 03:23:14.152]  They just brand it that way so that they can have some kind of audience to monetize it.
[03:23:14.152 --> 03:23:18.713]  All the Info Warriors know exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:23:18.713 --> 03:23:22.035]  And not only does this happen in so-called right-wing conservative media,
[03:23:23.177 --> 03:23:30.342]  Where you get a bunch of beta male cucks, beta female cucks that are running around complaining that people are being too mean?
[03:23:30.342 --> 03:23:35.746]  It's like, dude, what do you expect at this point?
[03:23:35.746 --> 03:23:36.227]  Right?
[03:23:36.227 --> 03:23:47.795]  It's like you're watching the fall of the nation, you're watching the fall of the United States of America, and people are concerned whether Alex Jones or Drew Hernandez is being too loud and too mean?
[03:23:47.795 --> 03:23:49.777]  I can't be loud enough!
[03:23:51.147 --> 03:23:52.148]  You want to know why?
[03:23:52.148 --> 03:23:53.689]  Because you look at the opposite.
[03:23:53.689 --> 03:24:01.016]  These people, whether they're radical leftists or they're rhino, you know, New World Order, deep state plants in the right, whatever it is, right?
[03:24:01.016 --> 03:24:02.957]  They're agents of Satan.
[03:24:02.957 --> 03:24:05.520]  These people are about it.
[03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:07.862]  They will go as far as they possibly can.
[03:24:07.862 --> 03:24:17.931]  I'd be willing to say that some of these people believe in what they believe, probably more founded and grounded in their satanic ideologies than they do
[03:24:18.852 --> 03:24:38.561]  And some people that find themselves just thinking they love America, thinking they support America, but when it comes down to it, when you get these deep state agents and these agents of Satan going after your bank account, going after your livelihood, these people pop out of the ground like weeds, everybody flees.
[03:24:38.561 --> 03:24:44.304]  Now I know the info warriors and the thought criminals and everybody watching, I know you guys are about this because if you're watching Info Wars,
[03:24:45.623 --> 03:24:51.647]  I mean, you've probably been riding with Alex Jones for a very long time, and you know just exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:24:51.647 --> 03:25:00.932]  But, we do need to continue to push this, and we do need to continue to mark those who don't belong.
[03:25:00.932 --> 03:25:08.437]  You know, the Bible talks about this as well in Romans chapter 16, is that when you see those that are causing division, and you see those that are
[03:25:09.947 --> 03:25:13.289]  Not a part of what the body of Christ is supposed to be doing.
[03:25:13.289 --> 03:25:15.770]  You identify a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:25:15.770 --> 03:25:20.172]  You identify someone that is claiming to be something that they're actually not.
[03:25:20.172 --> 03:25:22.514]  The Bible says to mark them.
[03:25:22.514 --> 03:25:24.555]  You watch them.
[03:25:24.555 --> 03:25:33.980]  And in some cases you put them before the entire church so they might be humiliated so that everyone else might fear and understand that this is not going to be tolerated.
[03:25:33.980 --> 03:25:36.501]  Those are in the pastoral epistles in 1st and 2nd Timothy.
[03:25:37.597 --> 03:25:50.783]  You know, pastors don't talk like that anymore because we have a lot of beta-cuck individuals that are afraid to really just crack down and drop the hammer when it's necessary to do so for the sake of righteousness, truth, and preserving what we all know and love.
[03:25:50.783 --> 03:25:53.384]  This is how you lose!
[03:25:53.384 --> 03:25:59.287]  When you get into a position where you're too afraid to speak out, you're too afraid to hurt somebody's feelings,
[03:26:00.791 --> 03:26:03.793]  God, you could be as nice as you possibly want.
[03:26:03.793 --> 03:26:07.715]  You could be as nice and has the most articulate argument.
[03:26:07.715 --> 03:26:11.337]  But you're dealing with people that worship their father, the devil.
[03:26:11.337 --> 03:26:14.619]  You're dealing with people that are possessed by demons.
[03:26:14.619 --> 03:26:18.121]  You're dealing with people that want to destroy you.
[03:26:18.121 --> 03:26:21.182]  I'm talking about the people that want the New World Order.
[03:26:21.182 --> 03:26:25.485]  I'm talking about the people that want to mobilize the FBI to go after parents.
[03:26:26.227 --> 03:26:37.957]  That are concerned and pissed off that their daughter got raped in Loudoun County by a boy that claimed to be a girl in a transgender bathroom!
[03:26:37.957 --> 03:26:39.859]  That's who I'm talking about right now.
[03:26:39.859 --> 03:26:43.061]  And then they turn around and say, we love democracy.
[03:26:43.061 --> 03:26:47.325]  Oh, some of them will even come out and say, we're America first and we support the First Amendment.
[03:26:47.325 --> 03:26:51.068]  We support the United States of America.
[03:26:51.068 --> 03:26:52.749]  I'll give you an example.
[03:26:52.749 --> 03:26:54.351]  Look what's happening with Ukraine.
[03:26:55.020 --> 03:26:56.661]  Here's an article from Breitbart.
[03:26:56.661 --> 03:26:58.483]  House Republicans visit Kiev.
[03:26:58.483 --> 03:27:03.306]  There is strong bipartisan support to give Ukraine everything that it needs.
[03:27:03.306 --> 03:27:04.988]  House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Rep.
[03:27:04.988 --> 03:27:07.109]  Michael McCaul.
[03:27:07.109 --> 03:27:18.598]  Republican Texas led several Republican lawmakers Tuesday on a trip to Ukraine where they expressed their support to President Vladimir Zelensky and conducted oversight of military equipment.
[03:27:18.598 --> 03:27:22.521]  And they all conclude that Ukraine just needs everything that it needs.
[03:27:23.587 --> 03:27:27.370]  While in Ohio, President Trump is making a trip there today.
[03:27:27.370 --> 03:27:36.335]  You have other conservative influencers and individuals that are showing up to Ohio, helping the people that are being contaminated.
[03:27:36.335 --> 03:27:41.379]  Their water, their air supply, the acid rain falling from the sky.
[03:27:41.379 --> 03:27:43.240]  Animals are dying.
[03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:47.863]  Just so happens these regions in Ohio just, just so happen to be Trump country.
[03:27:48.519 --> 03:27:53.282]  So of course the Biden administration is going to do nothing to help these people.
[03:27:53.282 --> 03:27:53.722]  Why?
[03:27:53.722 --> 03:27:55.883]  Because they hate you!
[03:27:55.883 --> 03:28:03.668]  They hate you and they're willing to allow you to die over their own political beliefs and ideologies.
[03:28:03.668 --> 03:28:07.830]  Why do you think Pete Buttigieg is doing nothing?
[03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:10.932]  Why do you think he took so long to make a statement?
[03:28:10.932 --> 03:28:12.593]  Because he's incompetent?
[03:28:12.593 --> 03:28:13.233]  No!
[03:28:13.233 --> 03:28:15.355]  Stop thinking these people are incompetent.
[03:28:15.355 --> 03:28:17.476]  These people know exactly what they're doing.
[03:28:19.640 --> 03:28:36.486]  So-called puppet president Joe Biden, yes, is a vegetable and the New World Order needs those vegetable mindless puppets, but he's fully aware of what he's doing by allowing himself to be controlled by those that compromised him.
[03:28:36.486 --> 03:28:42.488]  These people hate you and they're willing to allow you to die because of what they believe.
[03:28:43.479 --> 03:28:46.585]  Ohio is a disaster, but there they are.
[03:28:46.585 --> 03:28:54.440]  Democrats and Republicans pushing for war in Ukraine, and I'm supposed to give my money to them and just not care about America.
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:55.001]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:57.682 --> 03:29:07.108]  Introducing InfoWars super high-end supplement line at up to 50% off what these same formulas are sold for in stores.

[03:29:57.335 --> 03:29:59.516]  There is a war on for your mind.
[03:29:59.516 --> 03:30:01.317]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[03:30:01.317 --> 03:30:03.378]  This is an information war.
[03:30:03.378 --> 03:30:08.061]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[03:30:08.061 --> 03:30:20.508]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[03:30:20.908 --> 03:30:22.389]  But we can't do it without funding.

[03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:36.161]  We're non-violent.
[03:30:36.581 --> 03:30:44.506]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[03:30:44.506 --> 03:30:46.828]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[03:30:46.828 --> 03:30:48.669]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[03:30:48.669 --> 03:30:49.790]  We're going over the top.
[03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:51.311]  But right now is the critical juncture.

[03:31:59.289 --> 03:32:05.694]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[03:32:05.694 --> 03:32:07.436]  World War III has already started.
[03:32:07.436 --> 03:32:09.758]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:32:09.758 --> 03:32:10.919]  There's mass censorship.
[03:32:10.919 --> 03:32:13.120]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[03:32:13.120 --> 03:32:15.382]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[03:32:15.382 --> 03:32:19.866]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[03:32:20.026 --> 03:32:23.989]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.

[03:32:58.233 --> 03:33:04.157]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.948 --> 03:33:29.201]  Individual that is always about bringing the receipts, because if we're talking about truth, we're talking about error and lies, making some pretty, uh, pretty harsh accusations, being spot on right over the target.
[03:33:29.201 --> 03:33:33.725]  You know, people wonder why individuals like myself can't have a home on YouTube.
[03:33:34.648 --> 03:33:38.032]  Get de-boosted and throttled out of oblivion.
[03:33:38.032 --> 03:33:43.158]  Why Alex Jones gets censored across the entire globe.
[03:33:43.158 --> 03:33:45.681]  And people wonder why.
[03:33:45.681 --> 03:33:52.570]  Why do these individuals, why do these individuals end up in these positions where they're not allowed to have a voice?
[03:33:53.965 --> 03:34:09.050]  Is it because they're mean, and then you see, you know, the New World Order proxies in the media, and in Hollywood, they send these, they're little creatures out there, the Brian Stelters, and, and these losers that just run around and say, Alex, Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist, and Drew Hernandez is as well!
[03:34:09.050 --> 03:34:14.852]  How dare, how dare they show the New World Order being talked about at, at Davos!
[03:34:14.852 --> 03:34:15.772]  Right?
[03:34:15.772 --> 03:34:17.233]  Why do they do that?
[03:34:17.233 --> 03:34:18.173]  Why do they do that?
[03:34:18.173 --> 03:34:19.533]  They do that because it's 100% real.
[03:34:19.533 --> 03:34:19.613]  Okay?
[03:34:22.913 --> 03:34:28.175]  They do that and they slander because these people understand that it's all real.
[03:34:28.175 --> 03:34:40.220]  They understand and they believe and they know that God is real and that the devil is 100% fully functional and real because they serve him.
[03:34:40.220 --> 03:34:49.003]  That's why you see the Luciferianism and the open occult rituals at the Grammys with Sam Smith running around
[03:34:49.989 --> 03:34:55.932]  Praising the devil and Hollywood just sitting there throwing up their arms in the air like it's some amazing thing.
[03:34:55.932 --> 03:34:56.373]  Yes!
[03:34:56.373 --> 03:35:02.076]  Oh, it's the Church of Satan out in the open and everyone just loves it and praises it!
[03:35:02.076 --> 03:35:03.817]  Totally degenerate.
[03:35:03.817 --> 03:35:05.217]  Totally disgusting.
[03:35:05.217 --> 03:35:07.779]  100% satanic.
[03:35:07.779 --> 03:35:09.079]  There it is.
[03:35:09.079 --> 03:35:12.962]  Throwing all of the signs and symbols up.
[03:35:12.962 --> 03:35:15.083]  They look like little exorcist characters.
[03:35:16.215 --> 03:35:20.196]  Forming some kind of pentagram center stage at the Grammys?
[03:35:20.196 --> 03:35:23.878]  Why are you beginning to see this?
[03:35:23.878 --> 03:35:36.122]  The difference now than the past, because if you grew up in the 80s, you grew up in the past, you've seen satanic symbolism, rock bands using pentagrams, throwing up the 666 everywhere.
[03:35:36.122 --> 03:35:39.863]  What's fast-forwarded now is the technology of the day.
[03:35:39.863 --> 03:35:44.265]  The things that have changed now is the technology where we currently are at today.
[03:35:45.382 --> 03:35:55.866]  Bible scholars used to ask themselves all the time, how in the world will the Antichrist establish a one world government?
[03:35:55.866 --> 03:36:07.711]  Because they take a look at passages in the Bible that say his mark will be in the forehead and or the forearm and his number will be 666, the mark of the beast.
[03:36:07.711 --> 03:36:09.032]  Bible scholars would ask themselves,
[03:36:10.231 --> 03:36:12.712]  In times past, how could that ever happen?
[03:36:12.712 --> 03:36:25.975]  They couldn't comprehend what kind of technology that would be used in order to implement a system that would get the whole world in unison and on board.
[03:36:25.975 --> 03:36:33.557]  And that they might be able to, or will be able, to surveil it and control and regulate it.
[03:36:33.557 --> 03:36:37.338]  Because it's one thing for the king to put out a decree.
[03:36:37.338 --> 03:36:38.418]  People can hide from that.
[03:36:39.167 --> 03:36:41.268]  People can get around that.
[03:36:41.268 --> 03:36:52.956]  But the technology that has changed right now with all the Satanism that you're seeing, the occult worship out in the open, people open about their Luciferianism.
[03:36:52.956 --> 03:36:57.919]  The technology is catching up with what the Bible said would take place in the end times.
[03:36:57.919 --> 03:36:58.659]  I mean, look what happened in 2020.
[03:37:00.043 --> 03:37:03.125]  Majority of the world was willing to bend the knee.
[03:37:03.125 --> 03:37:05.566]  Global lockdowns.
[03:37:05.566 --> 03:37:06.506]  2021 came around.
[03:37:06.506 --> 03:37:10.048]  There were rumors in 2020 about a vaccine passport.
[03:37:10.048 --> 03:37:12.289]  You would be locked out of the economy.
[03:37:12.289 --> 03:37:15.771]  If you were a medical healthcare worker, you lost your job.
[03:37:15.771 --> 03:37:18.392]  If you worked in the federal government, you lost your job.
[03:37:18.392 --> 03:37:20.113]  This is still taking place today.
[03:37:20.113 --> 03:37:22.254]  We saw this in Australia.
[03:37:22.254 --> 03:37:24.195]  We saw this in New Zealand.
[03:37:24.195 --> 03:37:25.556]  We saw the entire world.
[03:37:26.425 --> 03:37:29.307]  Not you guys out there in the info warriors that said, yeah, you know what?
[03:37:29.307 --> 03:37:31.129]  No, I want my freedom.
[03:37:31.129 --> 03:37:32.690]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[03:37:32.690 --> 03:37:34.832]  I'm not talking about you guys.
[03:37:34.832 --> 03:37:42.778]  We did see millions of people freaking out, willing to sacrifice their freedoms and their liberties for what?
[03:37:43.988 --> 03:37:49.250]  Safety, security, stay home, save lives.
[03:37:49.250 --> 03:37:59.092]  Yes, the virtue signal is we're going to stay home and I am going to save lives because I'm so great because the great high priest, Dr. Fauci, told me so.
[03:37:59.092 --> 03:38:02.253]  We saw the mask formation cult form across the entire world.
[03:38:02.253 --> 03:38:04.334]  There they are right now.
[03:38:04.334 --> 03:38:11.616]  The literal cult exists to this day, where people were willing to obey Big Brother, lock down in their homes,
[03:38:13.189 --> 03:38:14.870]  Never go outside ever again!
[03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:24.892]  They bent the knee to vaccine passports to get locked out of the economy, and this was on a worldwide scale.
[03:38:24.892 --> 03:38:25.813]  Drew, what are you talking about?
[03:38:25.813 --> 03:38:33.975]  What I'm talking about is that the world is ready and primed to see what the Bible said is going to come in the end times.
[03:38:35.123 --> 03:38:40.406]  For a centralized world leader that will be a superstar on planet Earth, according to the Bible.
[03:38:40.406 --> 03:38:45.288]  This guy is gonna be just a rock star on planet Earth.
[03:38:45.288 --> 03:38:48.810]  Gonna bring unity in a way that the world has never seen before.
[03:38:48.810 --> 03:38:52.412]  A very attractive individual that people are gonna be drawn to.
[03:38:52.412 --> 03:38:54.453]  The Bible says that he is an orator.
[03:38:54.453 --> 03:38:59.015]  He speaks great things that attract people to him.
[03:38:59.015 --> 03:39:04.498]  But at the same time, he's filled with lawlessness, evil, and satanically charged.
[03:39:05.672 --> 03:39:10.677]  The world is ready because through fear they will bow down.
[03:39:10.677 --> 03:39:18.404]  So if we end up in a situation where the whole world, it's kind of quite literally the opposite of what God says.
[03:39:18.404 --> 03:39:24.791]  God says that he himself will be our provider, our all in all, that we should fear God above all else.
[03:39:25.737 --> 03:39:32.461]  When it comes to Satan, the Antichrist, and all these figures that we see in the Bible that are real, they're literally the opposite.
[03:39:32.461 --> 03:39:34.462]  That is what Antichrist is.
[03:39:34.462 --> 03:39:38.284]  It's not just someone that's in opposition, it's someone in the place of a pseudo-Christ.
[03:39:38.284 --> 03:39:42.047]  They claim to be a savior, but they function through fear.
[03:39:42.047 --> 03:39:44.108]  It's the opposite of love and comfort.
[03:39:45.194 --> 03:39:53.979]  And these people will pressure people through fear in order to sacrifice their freedoms, sacrifice their liberties, so they are given total control.
[03:39:53.979 --> 03:40:00.203]  They get the keys handed straight over to them, and don't even have to fire a shot!
[03:40:00.203 --> 03:40:09.129]  You see, this is all satanically inspired, and what we're watching on a grand scale right now is we're watching all these things continue to develop on a day-to-day basis.
[03:40:09.129 --> 03:40:12.791]  So I encourage people every single day, we're on the verge of World War III,
[03:40:14.696 --> 03:40:28.246]  You got a puppet President Joe Biden in Ukraine trying to talk tough in Poland, saying that he's ready and that the United States support for Ukraine when it comes to war is never going to waver.
[03:40:28.246 --> 03:40:36.432]  You got puppet President Biden talking tough on the world stage saying, back in our home, I just see nothing but Ukrainian flags all over the place in America.
[03:40:36.432 --> 03:40:38.233]  I mean, he's not lying.
[03:40:38.928 --> 03:40:43.872]  You have all these woked-hard losers running around just waiting for the next thing to support!
[03:40:43.872 --> 03:40:45.433]  Give me the next update!
[03:40:45.433 --> 03:40:46.954]  The NPCs running around!
[03:40:46.954 --> 03:40:48.515]  Tell me what to believe, Daddy!
[03:40:48.515 --> 03:40:49.936]  Jab me more, Daddy!
[03:40:49.936 --> 03:40:51.117]  Oh, yes!
[03:40:51.117 --> 03:40:52.979]  Impose your tyranny on me more, Daddy!
[03:40:52.979 --> 03:40:53.959]  I want more!
[03:40:53.959 --> 03:40:55.060]  I want more!
[03:40:55.060 --> 03:40:56.341]  Just give it to me, Daddy!
[03:40:56.341 --> 03:40:59.924]  Come on, dude!
[03:40:59.924 --> 03:41:01.105]  Let's take a look around you!
[03:41:01.983 --> 03:41:07.086]  I mean, even this video right here that went viral the other day, Joe Biden running around trying to talk tough.
[03:41:07.086 --> 03:41:08.707]  You got people cheering, yes!
[03:41:08.707 --> 03:41:10.128]  World War III!
[03:41:10.128 --> 03:41:11.129]  Yes!
[03:41:11.129 --> 03:41:16.412]  I don't even know why I'm supporting Ukraine, but let's just end up in another never-ending war!
[03:41:16.412 --> 03:41:17.453]  Yeah!
[03:41:17.453 --> 03:41:19.094]  More people die!
[03:41:19.094 --> 03:41:20.174]  Yeah!
[03:41:20.174 --> 03:41:20.855]  Death!
[03:41:20.855 --> 03:41:21.775]  Destruction!
[03:41:21.775 --> 03:41:22.736]  Woo!
[03:41:22.736 --> 03:41:23.837]  Let's all die!
[03:41:23.837 --> 03:41:26.458]  This is advanced, man.
[03:41:26.458 --> 03:41:29.240]  You want to talk about an information war, a PSYOP?
[03:41:29.927 --> 03:41:30.627]  Right?
[03:41:30.627 --> 03:41:37.629]  Get people all on board cheering their own destruction and demise over lies.
[03:41:37.629 --> 03:41:38.629]  Okay?
[03:41:38.629 --> 03:41:41.850]  Over lies.
[03:41:41.850 --> 03:41:45.871]  President Vladimir Zelensky is- I'm just gonna say it, man.
[03:41:45.871 --> 03:41:56.373]  President Vladimir Zelensky is quite literally, probably, probably the most effective, successful grifter of all time, bro.
[03:41:57.350 --> 03:42:02.693]  Of all time, this guy has raised tens of billions of dollars off of the U.S.
[03:42:02.693 --> 03:42:03.113]  alone!
[03:42:03.113 --> 03:42:04.834]  Off of the U.S.
[03:42:04.834 --> 03:42:05.774]  alone!
[03:42:05.774 --> 03:42:08.355]  While our infrastructure is falling apart!
[03:42:08.355 --> 03:42:13.738]  While the CCP is invading our skies, uninvited!
[03:42:13.738 --> 03:42:16.599]  While you're watching Los Angeles fall to pieces!
[03:42:16.599 --> 03:42:19.901]  The fentanyl is flooding the United States!
[03:42:19.901 --> 03:42:21.702]  The economy is plunging!
[03:42:21.702 --> 03:42:23.623]  We're on the verge of a Great Depression!
[03:42:23.623 --> 03:42:25.704]  But no.
[03:42:26.758 --> 03:42:29.259]  I'm supposed to support Zelensky.
[03:42:29.259 --> 03:42:31.419]  I'm supposed to care about Ukraine.
[03:42:31.419 --> 03:42:35.380]  This is beyond America Last, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:35.380 --> 03:42:37.981]  This is let's just destroy humanity.
[03:42:37.981 --> 03:42:39.981]  Let's just destroy humans.
[03:42:39.981 --> 03:42:41.541]  They don't care if you're an American.
[03:42:41.541 --> 03:42:42.982]  They don't care what you are.
[03:42:42.982 --> 03:42:45.502]  All they care about is that you're willing to obey.
[03:42:45.502 --> 03:42:50.063]  And if you don't, it's death, death, death, death and destruction.
[03:42:50.063 --> 03:42:52.544]  And they cheer it because that's what they want.
[03:42:52.544 --> 03:42:53.084]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:57.611 --> 03:43:00.312]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:43:00.312 --> 03:43:05.194]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:43:05.194 --> 03:43:10.517]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[03:43:59.454 --> 03:44:01.497]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[03:44:01.497 --> 03:44:04.280]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[03:44:04.280 --> 03:44:07.023]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[03:44:07.023 --> 03:44:09.125]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[03:44:09.125 --> 03:44:11.187]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[03:44:11.187 --> 03:44:12.169]  None of that's true.
[03:44:12.169 --> 03:44:13.070]  It's all being appealed.
[03:44:13.530 --> 03:44:15.631]  They want you to think Infowars is dead.
[03:44:15.631 --> 03:44:22.493]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[03:44:22.493 --> 03:44:25.934]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.

[03:44:59.562 --> 03:45:05.967]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[03:45:05.967 --> 03:45:07.709]  World War III has already started.
[03:45:07.709 --> 03:45:10.031]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:45:10.031 --> 03:45:11.192]  There's mass censorship.
[03:45:11.192 --> 03:45:13.393]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[03:45:13.393 --> 03:45:15.675]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[03:45:15.675 --> 03:45:20.139]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[03:45:20.299 --> 03:45:24.261]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.

[03:45:57.577 --> 03:46:03.319]  If you go to OnlineHealthNow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at The Wellness Company.
[03:46:03.319 --> 03:46:07.200]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[03:46:07.200 --> 03:46:11.741]  I contribute like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[03:46:11.741 --> 03:46:17.363]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement.
[03:46:17.483 --> 03:46:19.185]  That features natokinase.
[03:46:19.185 --> 03:46:21.527]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:46:21.527 --> 03:46:27.233]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:46:27.233 --> 03:46:28.014]  This is very important.
[03:46:28.014 --> 03:46:33.059]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:46:33.059 --> 03:46:34.560]  People are low with the spike protein.
[03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:35.501]  They don't feel well.
[03:46:35.501 --> 03:46:37.223]  This is a potential solution.
[03:46:37.223 --> 03:46:40.286]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:46:40.286 --> 03:46:41.467]  So does ivermectin.
[03:46:41.627 --> 03:46:43.188]  And now, natokinase.
[03:46:43.188 --> 03:46:44.548]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:46:44.548 --> 03:46:50.771]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[03:46:50.771 --> 03:46:55.153]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[03:46:55.153 --> 03:46:58.114]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:46:58.114 --> 03:47:03.997]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.878 --> 03:47:20.321]  Alright guys, I gotta confess, you know, sometimes I got the attention span of a squirrel in my mind.
[03:47:20.321 --> 03:47:31.665]  And, uh, as a host, I don't know, sometimes, you know, that, uh, I guess it works, I guess it could be entertaining, but sometimes, I don't know if it kind of works against, you know, sometimes when I'm trying to get my thoughts out there.
[03:47:31.665 --> 03:47:35.187]  Uh, so, I was talking about receipts!
[03:47:35.187 --> 03:47:40.289]  Then we ended up somehow talking about how, you know, they want World War III and they all want to kill us!
[03:47:41.315 --> 03:47:43.556]  Um, so I wanted to show you guys these receipts.
[03:47:43.556 --> 03:47:46.658]  I'm actually host of two shows.
[03:47:46.658 --> 03:47:55.202]  One is Drew Hernandez Live that you guys can find exclusively on Rumble and I also host a show called Frontlines with Drew Hernandez on Real America's Voice.
[03:47:55.202 --> 03:47:57.783]  And with that show we have various different reporters.
[03:47:58.743 --> 03:48:07.746]  That go out and report on my behalf in different regions of the world, the United States, especially when things are going down.
[03:48:07.746 --> 03:48:11.848]  So we sent a team to East Palestine last night.
[03:48:11.848 --> 03:48:13.188]  They're out there right now.
[03:48:13.188 --> 03:48:16.670]  And so I wanted to show you guys, look at this video of one of our reporters.
[03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:18.010]  Her name is Rebecca Brannon.
[03:48:18.010 --> 03:48:19.891]  You guys should go follow her on Twitter as well.
[03:48:20.983 --> 03:48:30.491]  East Palestine residents like this woman are frustrated with the lack of federal government response and do not trust the EPA is being thorough or transparent.
[03:48:30.491 --> 03:48:33.254]  The woman in the video says, they don't care about us.
[03:48:33.254 --> 03:48:33.914]  Bottom line.
[03:48:33.914 --> 03:48:34.435]  Take a look at this.
[03:48:35.302 --> 03:48:42.647]  Dioxide, the smallest particle, will not be able to carry a baby for three generations.
[03:48:42.647 --> 03:48:45.429]  People who are pregnant are going to abort.
[03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:48.531]  They're going to get cancer, heart cancer, liver cancer.
[03:48:48.531 --> 03:48:50.873]  I think they did not check for the dioxin.
[03:48:50.873 --> 03:48:58.598]  Whatever they're checking for and saying is safe levels, it's either an outright lie or they aren't checking for the right things.
[03:48:58.598 --> 03:49:01.821]  And dioxin is the big news that nobody's talking about.
[03:49:02.581 --> 03:49:03.922]  Please check it out.
[03:49:03.922 --> 03:49:06.364]  It sends a very clear message to the American people.
[03:49:06.364 --> 03:49:09.647]  They don't care about us.
[03:49:09.647 --> 03:49:11.429]  Bottom line.
[03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:12.650]  Bottom line.
[03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:15.192]  That's what I'm talking about, right?
[03:49:15.192 --> 03:49:19.596]  The bottom line is that in unison, right?
[03:49:19.596 --> 03:49:25.901]  Because I think people that aren't, you know, really politically engaged, they sit back and they say, wow, what a terrible thing.
[03:49:26.795 --> 03:49:28.376]  That's going on in Ohio.
[03:49:28.376 --> 03:49:30.216]  Their water is contaminated.
[03:49:30.216 --> 03:49:32.237]  Their air is contaminated.
[03:49:32.237 --> 03:49:34.278]  They got animals dying.
[03:49:34.278 --> 03:49:36.198]  Fish, chickens, you name it.
[03:49:36.198 --> 03:49:37.959]  The people are suffering.
[03:49:37.959 --> 03:49:40.720]  What is Biden doing in Ukraine?
[03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:42.260]  Right?
[03:49:42.260 --> 03:49:47.202]  I think people are watching that and they're saying, that's crazy.
[03:49:47.202 --> 03:49:48.943]  But they don't think that deeply into it.
[03:49:48.943 --> 03:49:51.524]  And it's not just that these people are incompetent.
[03:49:51.524 --> 03:49:54.184]  No, this, they do this on purpose.
[03:49:54.184 --> 03:49:54.465]  Okay.
[03:49:54.465 --> 03:49:55.465]  These are the same people.
[03:49:56.539 --> 03:49:59.301]  That call you mega Republicans.
[03:49:59.301 --> 03:50:04.586]  These are the same people that call you radical right-wing extremists.
[03:50:04.586 --> 03:50:18.417]  These are the same people that call you a domestic terrorist because you're a law-abiding gun owner and you love the Second Amendment and you like to wave a don't tread me flag every now and then or have one in front of your house.
[03:50:18.417 --> 03:50:21.540]  These are the same people that view you that way.
[03:50:23.948 --> 03:50:42.717]  So when you see this current federal government allow Ohio, particularly in Trump country, suffer and get no help, and it takes Trump to go down there for these people to finally do something, oh, because they care about political optics.
[03:50:42.717 --> 03:50:44.078]  Drew, that's a little too far-fetched.
[03:50:44.078 --> 03:50:47.019]  Are these people really, are they really that crazy?
[03:50:47.019 --> 03:50:49.120]  Are they really that willing?
[03:50:49.867 --> 03:50:55.650]  To allow their political opponents to suffer on such a grand scale like that as some kind of punishment?
[03:50:55.650 --> 03:50:57.191]  Yes!
[03:50:57.191 --> 03:50:58.611]  Yes!
[03:50:58.611 --> 03:51:01.693]  Look what they did with January 6th.
[03:51:01.693 --> 03:51:07.035]  Look at the J6 prisoners right now to this day that are suffering.
[03:51:07.035 --> 03:51:11.898]  That are suffering because they view them as political opponents.
[03:51:11.898 --> 03:51:18.881]  So yes, are these people willing to allow you to suffer and die because they have a political difference than you do?
[03:51:20.094 --> 03:51:22.355]  It's not just a political difference.
[03:51:22.355 --> 03:51:26.237]  These people view you as terrorists.
[03:51:26.237 --> 03:51:29.339]  You know there's a reason for that, right?
[03:51:29.339 --> 03:51:32.900]  What does a terrorist have?
[03:51:32.900 --> 03:51:35.622]  What does a terrorist really have?
[03:51:35.622 --> 03:51:39.684]  Do terrorists have rights?
[03:51:39.684 --> 03:51:43.605]  Are terrorists viewed as people that are safe?
[03:51:43.605 --> 03:51:46.947]  Are terrorists viewed as human beings?
[03:51:46.947 --> 03:51:48.508]  Or are they viewed as threats?
[03:51:49.778 --> 03:51:53.019]  You don't view a terrorist as a human being with rights.
[03:51:53.019 --> 03:52:02.863]  You view a terrorist as someone that is a threat to the general public, that is a threat that needs to be taken out and eradicated.
[03:52:02.863 --> 03:52:03.343]  Okay?
[03:52:03.343 --> 03:52:06.245]  That is why these people use these kind of radical terms.
[03:52:06.245 --> 03:52:09.206]  Because they view you as someone that doesn't have rights.
[03:52:09.206 --> 03:52:11.407]  They view you as someone that's a threat.
[03:52:11.407 --> 03:52:15.028]  They view you as someone that needs to be taken out immediately.
[03:52:15.028 --> 03:52:19.490]  So it makes perfect sense to me that the people in Ohio are suffering.
[03:52:20.211 --> 03:52:26.175]  And the current federal government is doing nothing, supporting them, not at all.
[03:52:26.175 --> 03:52:28.076]  Why?
[03:52:28.076 --> 03:52:28.656]  Why?
[03:52:28.656 --> 03:52:29.637]  Because they're incompetent?
[03:52:29.637 --> 03:52:30.498]  No.
[03:52:30.498 --> 03:52:32.939]  Because they hate you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:32.939 --> 03:52:34.260]  These people hate you.
[03:52:34.260 --> 03:52:42.905]  Well, here's this viral video of Pete Buttigieg that was confronted about the crisis in Ohio.
[03:52:42.905 --> 03:52:44.486]  And just look at the answer.
[03:52:44.486 --> 03:52:46.548]  The answer speaks for itself.
[03:52:46.548 --> 03:52:46.908]  Take a look.
[03:52:47.850 --> 03:52:49.511]  Secretary, what do you have to say?
[03:52:49.511 --> 03:52:50.531]  Hi, how are you?
[03:52:50.531 --> 03:52:52.772]  Jenny here with the Daily Caller News Foundation.
[03:52:52.772 --> 03:52:59.074]  What do you have to say to the folks in Ohio, East Palestine, who are suffering right now?
[03:52:59.074 --> 03:53:09.377]  Well, I'd refer you to about a dozen interviews I've given today, and if you'd like to arrange a conversation, make sure to reach out to our press office.
[03:53:09.377 --> 03:53:11.038]  We don't have a message for them?
[03:53:11.038 --> 03:53:13.078]  I do, and I shared it with the press many times today.
[03:53:13.078 --> 03:53:14.099]  I'd refer you to those comments.
[03:53:14.679 --> 03:53:16.060]  You mind sharing it with us?
[03:53:16.060 --> 03:53:21.663]  No, I'm gonna refer you to the comments that I made to the press because, uh, right now I'm taking some personal time and I'm walking down the street.
[03:53:21.663 --> 03:53:22.924]  Are you going down there?
[03:53:22.924 --> 03:53:23.384]  What's that?
[03:53:23.384 --> 03:53:24.885]  Are you going down there at all?
[03:53:24.885 --> 03:53:27.406]  Um, yep, I am.
[03:53:27.406 --> 03:53:28.787]  When are you going?
[03:53:28.787 --> 03:53:31.048]  Um, I'll share that, uh, when I'm ready.
[03:53:31.048 --> 03:53:31.628]  Okay, thank you.
[03:53:31.628 --> 03:53:33.710]  Can I get a, can I get a photo of you?
[03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:37.112]  Yeah!
[03:53:37.112 --> 03:53:37.832]  This is all hate.
[03:53:38.965 --> 03:53:58.053]  That this is all not willing to communicate, not willing to give an answer, not willing to talk to the press, not willing to give an answer, okay, to the community of not just Ohio, but to the United States of America, because they feel superior to you.
[03:53:58.053 --> 03:53:59.234]  They believe that they don't
[03:53:59.972 --> 03:54:01.912]  Have to give an answer to the media.
[03:54:01.912 --> 03:54:05.833]  They feel like they're above the people of the United States of America.
[03:54:05.833 --> 03:54:08.854]  And they believe that they're just going to let you suffer.
[03:54:08.854 --> 03:54:11.135]  And my comments were enough.
[03:54:11.135 --> 03:54:15.215]  Oh, my comments that I made to the public are enough.
[03:54:15.215 --> 03:54:16.516]  I'm Pete Buttigieg.
[03:54:16.516 --> 03:54:17.896]  Can you leave me alone?
[03:54:17.896 --> 03:54:20.937]  Can you leave me alone while I'm out walking with my husband?
[03:54:20.937 --> 03:54:24.518]  I'm making some, I am, I'm on some personal time.
[03:54:24.518 --> 03:54:26.378]  I don't want to talk about this right now.
[03:54:28.064 --> 03:54:32.946]  It's just like, that's the reality of the situation!
[03:54:32.946 --> 03:54:45.890]  The reality of the situation is that these people hate you, and he's like, oh, I'm taking some personal time, I don't have time to talk to you right now, I know the people are suffering, but just don't look at my comments that I made on Twitter.
[03:54:45.890 --> 03:54:46.471]  What did he say?
[03:54:46.471 --> 03:54:47.691]  What did he say?
[03:54:47.691 --> 03:54:50.332]  It took him days, it took him like 10 days to make a comment?
[03:54:51.095 --> 03:54:53.236]  To communicate to the people of Ohio?
[03:54:53.236 --> 03:54:53.816]  What did he say?
[03:54:53.816 --> 03:54:57.057]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:54:57.057 --> 03:55:03.260]  One of our main concerns right now is that the people of Ohio have access to accurate information.
[03:55:07.882 --> 03:55:09.384]  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:55:09.384 --> 03:55:09.905]  You know what?
[03:55:09.905 --> 03:55:10.466]  You know what?
[03:55:10.466 --> 03:55:11.367]  You know what, guys?
[03:55:11.367 --> 03:55:11.948]  You know what?
[03:55:11.948 --> 03:55:12.368]  No, no, no.
[03:55:12.368 --> 03:55:12.829]  You know what?
[03:55:12.829 --> 03:55:13.570]  You know what?
[03:55:13.570 --> 03:55:15.452]  Alex Jones is too mean.
[03:55:15.452 --> 03:55:17.054]  Drew Hernandez is too mean.
[03:55:17.054 --> 03:55:19.938]  You know, Matt Walsh is too mean.
[03:55:19.938 --> 03:55:25.966]  These individuals that come out and they're aggressive with their messages because we see, we see the devil.
[03:55:26.647 --> 03:55:27.447]  We see.
[03:55:27.447 --> 03:55:28.688]  Our eyes are open.
[03:55:28.688 --> 03:55:30.169]  We see who we're dealing with.
[03:55:30.169 --> 03:55:33.130]  We know who our enemies are on both sides.
[03:55:33.130 --> 03:55:35.211]  And we're not tolerating it anymore.
[03:55:35.211 --> 03:55:42.014]  And we know that these people are willing to throw you all into gulags and designate you all domestic terrorists.
[03:55:42.014 --> 03:55:43.555]  Oh, but I'm the bad guy.
[03:55:43.555 --> 03:55:45.015]  But I'm too mean.
[03:55:45.015 --> 03:55:46.996]  Oh, you're not communicating effectively.
[03:55:46.996 --> 03:55:48.557]  You're not going to win them over.
[03:55:48.557 --> 03:55:50.358]  I don't want to win over these pedophiles, dude.
[03:55:51.661 --> 03:55:53.282]  Screw all these tyrants!
[03:55:53.282 --> 03:55:55.384]  Let them get dealt with by God!
[03:55:55.384 --> 03:55:56.585]  Give them the gospel!
[03:55:56.585 --> 03:55:57.926]  They could repent!
[03:55:57.926 --> 03:56:11.477]  But at the same time, we're gonna oppose evil, we're gonna oppose tyranny, we're not gonna tolerate this, and try and be, oh, the nice conservatives, the goody two-shoe beta males, and all these beta Christians that don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[03:56:12.495 --> 03:56:25.261]  When you have these tyrants that are willing to enslave you and enslave humanity and your children and manipulate their minds and warp their minds while people die in Ohio?
[03:56:25.261 --> 03:56:27.742]  We can't be loud enough.
[03:56:27.742 --> 03:56:29.843]  I can't have a microphone.
[03:56:29.843 --> 03:56:34.185]  I can't have a megaphone that's loud enough to speak to the entire world.
[03:56:34.185 --> 03:56:37.206]  There's a reason why they censor and it's for this reason.
[03:56:38.490 --> 03:56:44.955]  Because when you unmask the devil and you're speaking the truth at the same time, you're gonna get hit on all fronts.
[03:56:44.955 --> 03:56:46.836]  I'm so sick of these people.
[03:56:46.836 --> 03:56:48.297]  Aren't you guys?
[03:56:48.297 --> 03:56:55.643]  Aren't you guys sick of these beta cuck losers that run around and say, oh, you should just be nicer with your delivery.
[03:56:55.643 --> 03:56:58.065]  Oh my gosh, you're just, you're turning people off.
[03:56:58.065 --> 03:56:58.585]  You know what?
[03:56:58.585 --> 03:57:02.428]  Dude, they're already, these people are turned off, dude.
[03:57:02.428 --> 03:57:04.750]  And they're satanically charged.
[03:57:04.750 --> 03:57:06.231]  Totally depraved.
[03:57:06.231 --> 03:57:07.772]  Only God can save them.
[03:57:09.344 --> 03:57:14.068]  And these people are willing to destroy your life and your children.
[03:57:14.068 --> 03:57:16.070]  There's only one way.
[03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:19.913]  There's only one way, and it's this way right now.
[03:57:19.913 --> 03:57:33.744]  We have to be open about this, not be afraid of speaking the truth, not be afraid of hurting people's feelings, and we have to get to the place where right now we are bold in the power of God, because that's the only way to defeat this.
[03:57:34.597 --> 03:57:35.858]  Thank you guys so much.
[03:57:35.858 --> 03:57:36.718]  My name is Drew Hernandez.

[03:57:47.822 --> 03:57:52.346]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in Floor Wars MD.
[03:57:52.346 --> 03:58:04.776]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[03:58:04.776 --> 03:58:05.977]  These are high-end.

[03:58:30.856 --> 03:58:34.819]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer to your door,
[03:58:35.279 --> 03:58:40.894]  At prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[03:58:40.894 --> 03:58:42.919]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:58:49.087 --> 03:58:53.948]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:58:53.948 --> 03:59:00.370]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:59:00.370 --> 03:59:05.471]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:59:05.471 --> 03:59:07.191]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:59:07.191 --> 03:59:08.272]  Yes, I've persevered.
[03:59:08.272 --> 03:59:13.613]  But the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we have this success.
[03:59:14.333 --> 03:59:19.777]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:59:19.777 --> 03:59:24.099]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:59:24.099 --> 03:59:33.145]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:59:33.145 --> 03:59:34.686]  God bless you all.
[03:59:34.686 --> 03:59:35.727]  I salute you.
[03:59:35.727 --> 03:59:36.507]  I thank you.
[03:59:36.507 --> 03:59:42.551]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:59:42.831 --> 03:59:44.173]  The fight is my fight.
[03:59:44.173 --> 03:59:44.793]  It's your fight.
[03:59:44.793 --> 03:59:45.534]  It's our fight.
[03:59:45.534 --> 03:59:50.860]  God bless you all.
[03:59:50.860 --> 03:59:54.784]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
