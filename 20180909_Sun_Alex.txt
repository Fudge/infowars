[00:00.000 --> 00:07.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:07.200 --> 00:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:10.200 --> 00:18.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, already the ninth day of September 2018, and we're
[00:18.400 --> 00:23.080]  only, what, 58 days out now from this historic election?
[00:23.080 --> 00:31.200]  50, eight days out, my friends, and you've seen the massive censorship.
[00:31.200 --> 00:36.520]  They took us off Twitter, and then they took us off of the iPhone app that we just launched
[00:36.520 --> 00:40.640]  five weeks ago, that over 2 million downloads.
[00:40.640 --> 00:42.200]  So adults could get it and come here.
[00:42.200 --> 00:46.000]  They let you have porn sites, they've got, you know, the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.720]  where half the priests are pedophiles, the known pedophiles can have apps, the pornographers
[00:51.720 --> 00:57.680]  can all have apps, but info wars, ladies and gentlemen, you can have gambling apps, everything.
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.560]  But Alex Jones, he can't have that in the letter.
[01:01.560 --> 01:08.760]  They said because I mean spirited, and then I appear to humiliate, intimidate a targeted
[01:08.760 --> 01:10.840]  individual or group.
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.200]  And that is the CNN reporter, we're going to get into that coming up later.
[01:14.200 --> 01:19.480]  But the good news is America more and more sees through what's happening, and James Woods
[01:19.480 --> 01:22.880]  has come out to my defense and saying the organized banning of me on the Internet is
[01:22.880 --> 01:27.280]  they're getting a real fascism, trust me, and no sooner had James Woods put that out
[01:27.280 --> 01:36.600]  last night that we now have one of the heroes of Benghazi, the guy the whole movie 13 hours
[01:36.600 --> 01:40.320]  has made about hero Benghazi suspended from Twitter for criticizing Obama.
[01:40.320 --> 01:45.080]  Chris Peranto had some choice words for the former president who came out at press conference
[01:45.080 --> 01:47.840]  on Friday and said that he took credit for the economy.
[01:47.840 --> 01:54.160]  Trump didn't do anything, and that it was a conspiracy theory Benghazi didn't even exist.
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.480]  So you think about that.
[01:58.480 --> 02:02.480]  It's truly sick Twitter suspended Benghazi hero up to criticism of the president who
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.960]  left him there to die basically tried to kill him.
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.760]  And if you talk to the person that killed your friends and tried to kill you and got
[02:10.760 --> 02:17.000]  caught lying about it, then you are the monster you are the bad guy.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.200]  That is truly sick.
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.240]  And now they've banned him with a one day suspension on Twitter.
[02:23.240 --> 02:26.920]  And first it's a day, then it's a week, then they ban you entirely.
[02:26.920 --> 02:30.200]  And they're doing it to everyone and acting like, oh, you violated the rules.
[02:30.200 --> 02:33.840]  They let the left do whatever violence they want, call for whatever they want.
[02:33.840 --> 02:37.520]  The protected individuals are criminals in the power structure who can go around and
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.520]  do whatever they want.
[02:38.520 --> 02:39.520]  I don't want to be criticized.
[02:39.520 --> 02:42.520]  Well, suppressing people from being able to have their speech is only going to make
[02:42.520 --> 02:43.520]  a matter.
[02:43.520 --> 02:47.480]  Now, here's the big news we've been breaking down and a lot more of it's coming up here
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.720]  today and info wars.com and news wars.com and I want yours to be joining me during
[02:51.720 --> 02:54.880]  the four to six PM transmission right now.
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.560]  And it's so critical that you remember it isn't just talking the background when I
[02:58.560 --> 03:02.480]  say if you don't spread the live feeds, if you don't spread info wars.com, port slash
[03:02.480 --> 03:05.000]  show, they'll win.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.800]  And in critical times like this, when the neocons and others are trying to get a full
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.840]  scale war going in Syria and US air strikes have begun there and the Russians have been
[03:12.840 --> 03:16.160]  warning of more chemical false flags being prepared.
[03:16.160 --> 03:23.200]  You better know that it's time to be focused and involved and really keeping our eyes open
[03:23.200 --> 03:28.000]  and watching our six as well because history is unfolding and what happens if Russia retaliates.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.400]  This could spend on control very, very quickly.
[03:30.400 --> 03:35.000]  But again, we're in the middle of a Shiite Sunni civil war that's spilling into Europe
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.640]  and it's all part of that EU plan that's on info wars.com report EU intentionally collapsing
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.680]  European countries with illegals, this was four years ago, and it's in the Kalargi plan,
[03:44.680 --> 03:46.960]  the plan to actually collapse Europe into the Middle East.
[03:46.960 --> 03:54.760]  This is the official UN plan developed by Austrian Royal team more than 60 years ago.
[03:54.760 --> 04:00.200]  So that is such a critical article up on info wars.com.
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.880]  But that said, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[04:04.880 --> 04:10.120]  We are 58 days out from the election.
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.320]  And I know you're frosty.
[04:11.320 --> 04:13.280]  I know you're focused, but you can feel it.
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.520]  You can see it.
[04:14.520 --> 04:15.520]  It's unbelievable.
[04:15.520 --> 04:16.520]  They're trying to shut me down.
[04:16.520 --> 04:17.520]  They're trying to shut everybody down.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.520]  They're getting ready to stage.
[04:18.520 --> 04:21.320]  I believe terror attacks on the media and blame me because they keep having the talking
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.240]  point that I'm calling for violence when they're the ones doing it.
[04:24.240 --> 04:26.040]  So everybody have your video cameras ready.
[04:26.040 --> 04:29.440]  They want to kill everybody's live feeds so we can't cover what really happens when they
[04:29.440 --> 04:30.440]  pull their false flag.
[04:30.440 --> 04:33.720]  So I'm telling you maximum vigilance, they're trying to have a coup against the president.
[04:33.720 --> 04:35.480]  They're even in mainstream news.
[04:35.480 --> 04:38.480]  They're even in mainstream media admitting that they've got insiders trying to block
[04:38.480 --> 04:40.080]  his agenda and overthrow him.
[04:40.080 --> 04:44.400]  This country is in the middle of a civil war with powerful criminal globalist forces, but
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.480]  we have the constitution and history and right on our side and the economy is getting better.
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.080]  So we're in the fight, but need more focused and more involved than ever.
[04:52.080 --> 04:53.320]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[04:53.320 --> 04:56.520]  This is the info war next year's news today.
[04:56.520 --> 04:57.520]  Please pray for us.

[06:06.160 --> 06:11.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live transmission.
[06:11.960 --> 06:17.200]  It is Sunday, September 9th, 2018.
[06:17.200 --> 06:21.640]  And we're going to be here live with myself, Owen Schroer and others as we track the US
[06:21.640 --> 06:30.320]  bombardment under orders of President Donald J. Trump of Syrian forces entering the last
[06:30.320 --> 06:33.800]  al-Qaida ISIS area of Aleppo.
[06:33.800 --> 06:40.880]  And Trump earlier in the week had pledged strikes against Assad forces if they went
[06:40.880 --> 06:44.200]  into that final area on the border with Turkey.
[06:44.200 --> 06:48.840]  Turkey is threatened to invade if those ISIS al-Qaida forces are driven out.
[06:48.840 --> 06:52.040]  This is the last area stronghold at ISIS and al-Qaida hold.
[06:52.040 --> 06:56.280]  And we're going to be looking at the geopolitical ramifications of this coming up a little bit
[06:56.280 --> 06:57.280]  later in this transmission.
[06:57.280 --> 07:02.840]  But first, here are the facts breaking at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[07:02.840 --> 07:09.320]  As this breaks, there's only articles just now breaking in RT and in Reuters, both saying
[07:09.320 --> 07:10.320]  basically the same thing.
[07:10.320 --> 07:11.320]  Here they are.
[07:11.320 --> 07:18.080]  US jets strike Syria town with banned white phosphorus bombs, Russian Defense Ministry
[07:18.080 --> 07:23.960]  giant fires raging in the area, obviously used to incinerate ground forces.
[07:23.960 --> 07:32.160]  Reuters, Russia says US dropped phosphorus bombs over Syria's Dair al-Zor province.
[07:32.160 --> 07:36.920]  And there's now reports of other bombings and attacks going on as well.
[07:36.920 --> 07:41.320]  Israel just admitted in the last month they bombed Syria more than 200 times.
[07:41.320 --> 07:48.920]  So the war is already going on, but here's the big takeaway that's important.
[07:48.920 --> 07:53.400]  Russia has said since the April 14th strikes earlier this year that did turn out to be
[07:53.400 --> 07:56.720]  false flags, the chemical attacks didn't even happen this time.
[07:56.720 --> 08:00.680]  There were two previous false flags that did happen where ISIS and al-Qaida did launch
[08:00.680 --> 08:01.680]  chemical attacks.
[08:01.680 --> 08:06.600]  Even the UN later had to admit it and documented all of it.
[08:06.600 --> 08:08.600]  So just really amazing.
[08:08.600 --> 08:11.720]  We're going to cover more of that coming up in a moment, the actual video and actual
[08:11.720 --> 08:15.520]  history and actual proof of that information.
[08:15.520 --> 08:22.120]  But what's incredible is that now, what's six, seven months later, Russia is still vowing
[08:22.120 --> 08:28.960]  to retaliate as they did in public statements at the time to try to shoot down any missiles
[08:28.960 --> 08:34.600]  or shoot down any aircraft that come in and to target the launch site of the missiles
[08:34.600 --> 08:38.000]  or the bases where the aircraft were launched from.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.800]  Now, there's the news of Australia, put that back up on screen, please.
[08:41.800 --> 08:47.080]  Russia threatens to attack U.S. troops supporting Syrian rebels, Moscow warnable bomb U.S. troops
[08:47.080 --> 08:48.080]  of Syria.
[08:48.080 --> 08:51.560]  They don't abandon bases occupied by rebel forces, but the last time they did this, dozens
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.560]  of Russians ended up dead.
[08:52.560 --> 09:00.480]  It was actually about 450 so-called mercenaries that were really sheep-dipped, Spetsnaz, that's
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.000]  been a very strong message by President Trump to Russia.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.280]  And again, the claims that Trump is easy on Russia, massive tariffs, massive sanctions,
[09:09.280 --> 09:15.580]  moving major forces onto their borders in NATO and Eastern European countries, shipping
[09:15.580 --> 09:22.120]  heavy weapons to the Western Ukraine to actually attack the Russian forces.
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.880]  So this is one of the areas I disagree with President Trump on very, very strongly.
[09:26.880 --> 09:31.000]  I understand the geopolitical reasons of why they're doing it, I'll get to that in a moment.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.560]  I understand the geopolitical grand chessboard strategies and stratagems, but at the end
[09:36.560 --> 09:40.280]  of the day, if you're turning a sovereign country over to ISIS and al-Qaeda, and Assad
[09:40.280 --> 09:44.840]  didn't start the war seven years ago, and our own military said five years ago to Obama,
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.720]  we're not going to be al-Qaeda's air force, we're not going to be ISIS's air force, and
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.080]  Rand Paul spoke about it, Senator Paul, Senator Cruz valiantly did both great men on that
[09:54.080 --> 09:59.920]  subject, and Trump spoke out against it when he was just a billionaire, you know, mogul.
[09:59.920 --> 10:06.320]  And then now it becomes a different direction from the president, one of the few areas that
[10:06.320 --> 10:09.240]  he's not continued with what his pledges were.
[10:09.240 --> 10:13.680]  Now, I understand he's the president, he knows things we don't know, but what really
[10:13.680 --> 10:17.840]  got me mad back in April when this happened was it had been announced that he wasn't
[10:17.840 --> 10:21.480]  going to strike Syria, and that we thought it was a false flag, which it turned out to
[10:21.480 --> 10:22.480]  be.
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.120]  This time there wasn't even a chemical attack, they came and got kids out of school, they
[10:26.120 --> 10:31.000]  were later all interviewed, and threw water on them and put green paint on them, and said
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.120]  you're dying, and later the exact kids that supposedly died were interviewed and said
[10:35.120 --> 10:37.480]  no, it was all fake, it turned out it was.
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.560]  And then Trump began to cut the funding to the white helmets, who the UN funds that are
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.800]  really ISIS and al-Qaeda funded by Saudi Arabia, so Trump was supposed to get in and stop all
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.640]  of this, and Trump was supposed to get in and make Saudi Arabia stop funding radical
[10:52.640 --> 10:57.400]  Islam invading Wahhabism, and he was supposed to get Iran to back down, which I agree Iran's
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.680]  a threat, and instead we're right back to backing Saudi Arabia again, and taking over
[11:02.680 --> 11:03.680]  the region.
[11:03.680 --> 11:07.480]  Here's famous white helmet footage, where they sent out over the satellite what actually
[11:07.480 --> 11:12.800]  happened, and then later he just gets up and walks off, it's totally fake.
[11:12.800 --> 11:19.160]  There are hundreds of these videos, can YouTube and others work to take them down?
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.760]  Looks like CNN's been caught using actors to say Muslims were protesting the bombing
[11:23.760 --> 11:34.200]  of that pop concert last year of Little Girls, and then it turned out that it was all staged.
[11:34.200 --> 11:37.120]  So I'm not saying every event staged, but mainstream media's been caught staging dead
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.440]  babies and incubators that Saddam Hussein bashed the brains out of to get us in the Gulf
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.040]  War in 1990, that wasn't real, WMDs weren't real.
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.760]  Here's more fake footage, again shot in Syria last year, where they actually on the audio
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.760]  in Arabic say action, in fact let's back that up since we're into this now.
[11:54.760 --> 11:56.760]  Let's back that up, let's go ahead and play this.
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.760]  They're even playing the sad music in the background, and the kids doing the same, convulsing,
[12:02.760 --> 12:09.360]  and then the doctor winks, it's time to do it, clearly he's an actor, and then he falls
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.360]  over, but no one else falls over from the chemical weapons, not all the camera people.
[12:12.360 --> 12:19.600]  So if you're a radio listener, you need to go to infowars.com and you'll see the live
[12:19.600 --> 12:21.720]  feed of this, we'll also have it archived.
[12:21.720 --> 12:25.640]  This is why they want to shut off the internet though, because I'm going to show you this.
[12:25.640 --> 12:31.200]  Now the first two chemical attacks, after Obama said there's a red line four years ago,
[12:31.200 --> 12:35.280]  five years ago, and if you cross it with chemical attacks, we'll invade, well Assad was already
[12:35.280 --> 12:37.440]  winning then, why would he launch a chemical attack?
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.880]  He already agreed to give his weapons up, and it showed ISIS and al-Qaeda doing al-Aqbar
[12:41.880 --> 12:47.040]  chanting and firing the mortars into areas held by Assad, and then showing real dying
[12:47.040 --> 12:50.280]  kids saying, oh my God, look, he did this, we've got to invade.
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.040]  They did that twice and got caught, turned out it was Saudi Arabian munitions.
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.640]  The third time, in April this year, it got confirmed, even British newspapers a few months
[12:59.640 --> 13:01.560]  after said, okay, it was staged.
[13:01.560 --> 13:07.240]  They had town halls in Syria showing all the kids you saw dying, up there saying no, they
[13:07.240 --> 13:11.400]  came to our school, they gave us granola bars, they gave us candy, they gave us milk, they
[13:11.400 --> 13:14.600]  said, come to the hospital, they dumped water on us, they told us, flop around, they would
[13:14.600 --> 13:16.440]  give us more candy.
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.680]  So we'll get to those in a moment.
[13:19.680 --> 13:26.520]  But first off, here's the big issue, the U.S. strikes have begun in Syria against the one
[13:26.520 --> 13:32.800]  area that's still held by ISIS and al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabian forces who initiated the
[13:32.800 --> 13:34.600]  first invasion.
[13:34.600 --> 13:42.880]  In IDLIB, it lived right near the Turkish border, and so this is a very complex crisis for
[13:42.880 --> 13:43.880]  Europe.
[13:43.880 --> 13:49.040]  Turkey is threatened, the dictator has to open up all of Syria, let that humanitarian crisis
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.440]  flood through into Europe with a 20 million refugees, not just the 15 million that are
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.440]  there.
[13:54.440 --> 13:56.440]  So Trump's trying to contain that.
[13:56.440 --> 13:59.960]  So I'm not even second-guessing the president here, okay, because I've really studied this
[13:59.960 --> 14:01.720]  and looked at it from every angle.
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.120]  I understand Iran's belligerent, they've got real sleeper cells in the U.S. and Europe,
[14:06.120 --> 14:10.760]  they've been threatening our forces, they've got Hezbollah there, they mean business.
[14:10.760 --> 14:13.520]  So they are a real foreign power.
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.480]  Iran has threatened to activate these sleeper cells in just the last few months.
[14:18.480 --> 14:21.200]  We were the first to break it.
[14:21.200 --> 14:26.480]  Saudi Arabia is more of a client of the globalist and leftist elements of the CIA of people
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.880]  like Brennan, and so it's somewhat controllable, and Trump has said, stop what you're doing.
[14:30.880 --> 14:34.720]  But then Saudi Arabia's argument is, okay, we're stopping ISIS and al-Qaeda invasions
[14:34.720 --> 14:37.040]  worldwide.
[14:37.040 --> 14:47.040]  But you have to then stop Iran, because if you pull us out and you totally turn this
[14:47.040 --> 14:52.240]  over to Assad, he's allied with Iran, and then now Hezbollah is going to use this as a new
[14:52.240 --> 14:55.680]  offensive against all of its neighbors, which is true.
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.440]  And Iran is not agreeing, like they did five years ago with the Pentagon, if we block the
[14:59.440 --> 15:06.000]  total takeover that Obama was planning with Saudi Arabia, Iran tacitly agreed to pull out
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.360]  once al-Qaeda and ISIS forces were pushed out of the region.
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.520]  Well, now they're basically pushed out, but the camel's nose is under the tent flap, and
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.800]  Trump's saying, no, we're going to fully push them out, then Assad's going to hold new elections,
[15:17.800 --> 15:19.320]  and then we're going to pull back.
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.400]  So the question is, who's going to blink first, Iran or the U.S.?
[15:23.400 --> 15:29.360]  But technically, Iran is not agreeing to the full agreement in Trump's view.
[15:29.360 --> 15:33.400]  But from their view, ISIS and al-Qaeda need to be fully driven from the region until they
[15:33.400 --> 15:35.760]  fully pull out, but the Pentagon doesn't trust them.
[15:35.760 --> 15:39.280]  So that's the Mexican standoff we're in, and I understand why the president's doing this,
[15:39.280 --> 15:41.440]  but it doesn't mean I don't agree with it or disagree with it.
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.360]  I'm simply saying this could trigger a new world war, as many analysts are saying.
[15:45.360 --> 16:14.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[16:14.400 --> 16:21.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment, and I'm just saying
[16:44.400 --> 17:00.400]  that we're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment, and I don't
[17:00.400 --> 17:15.400]  agree with it or disagree with it, but we're going to look at more of this coming up here
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.400]  in just a moment.
[17:16.400 --> 17:31.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[17:31.400 --> 18:00.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[18:00.400 --> 18:26.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[18:26.400 --> 18:52.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[18:52.400 --> 19:21.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[19:21.400 --> 19:47.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[19:47.400 --> 20:16.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[20:16.400 --> 20:42.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[20:42.400 --> 21:11.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[21:11.400 --> 21:38.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[21:38.400 --> 22:05.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[22:05.400 --> 22:34.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[22:34.400 --> 23:03.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[23:03.400 --> 23:29.400]  We're going to look at more of this coming up here in just a moment.
[23:29.400 --> 23:52.400]  So our military had a great moral moment in all of this, and our own Senate did, and the American people did, and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com were catalyst for the whistleblowers to have a place to speak, and for the U.S. military to hold up those signs saying, I didn't join the Navy or the Marine Corps or the Army or the Air Force to work for Al Qaeda.
[23:52.400 --> 24:16.400]  So the agreement was made with Assad, the agreement was made with Iran, and they made tacit agreement with the Pentagon and the American people and Congress to bypass the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia and Obama to cut them off because it was immoral and evil to turn that multi-religious, more open society, one of the most open societies in the Middle East, over to the worst
[24:16.400 --> 24:26.400]  while hobbyists on the planet who don't let women drive and kill you if your wife isn't wearing a burqa over her head and stone their daughters to death, you know, if they don't say they believe in Muhammad.
[24:26.400 --> 24:44.400]  We had a good moral moment, it was the right thing to do, and sickeningly, Israel was involved, and I'm not an enemy of Israel, and Obama was involved, but the decision was made to turn that country, that ancient nation, or the oldest Christian nations, originally, over to the most radical Islamists who had put them all to the sword.
[24:44.400 --> 24:55.400]  Now six years later, you know, four years later, Trump gets in, he agreed with me and everybody else on this comment that's approached before, then he does one target to strike when there's a chemical attack, clearly a false flag.
[24:55.400 --> 25:01.400]  Then he does another big strike, clearly a false flag, and now admitted to be a false flag.
[25:01.400 --> 25:26.400]  And now he's doing it again, US forces are now striking Syria in multiple areas, big fires, you name it, because the Pentagon sees it as major Iranian forces coming in, not leaving, fortifying the area and preparing it as a front against Jordan, against Israel, against Iraq, against Saudi Arabia, because it's right there in a key area against Turkey.
[25:26.400 --> 25:54.400]  So all these other allies are freaking out over this, and they want, they want Iran to be taken care of, they don't want Iran, who already to a great extent, if we show a world map, Iran's already got a lot of control, and has areas where they have complete control through passage, through Iran, through Iraq, into Syria, and then everywhere else in the Middle East.
[25:54.400 --> 26:09.400]  And so the argument is, you better stabilize and get them out, and if you totally remove the Wahhabist and the al-Qaeda and ISIS people, there won't be any force countervailing them because Assad is in control, and he's allied with Iran.
[26:09.400 --> 26:30.400]  And so Assad has not been sending the signals to the Pentagon and others, and he's actually going to do what he said he would do now, and so that's why this is happening, and so that's why, now in deep hindsight, in deep reflection and research, I understand why Trump, a week ago, said, I may have to strike you, we may have to stop your forces from running them out of there,
[26:30.400 --> 26:49.400]  because then Iran will have full control of that corridor, right out of western Iran, right through southern Iraq, right up into western Iraq, into central Syria, right through up into the northeast, northwest corner.
[26:49.400 --> 27:08.400]  And so that's, if you can see there, they're coming through Iran, the Shiites have the south, so again, they come in through Iran, they go up, they go through, and then they've got passage to Europe, and now that is an Islamic invasion zone right into Europe.
[27:08.400 --> 27:23.400]  So we've plugged up the Wahhabis getting full control so that they can then invade, just like they did in Istanbul hundreds of years ago and took over that part of Europe, Turkey, the Byzantine Empire, so they can use that as a land route invasion force into the areas they already basically control.
[27:23.400 --> 27:32.400]  Albania, areas of Macedonia, Bulgaria, they're all been desperately trying to put up borders, but they already have been infested by jihadis.
[27:32.400 --> 27:46.400]  So, Trump knows the larger plan was originally destabilize Europe, destabilize North Africa, the Middle East, put in globalist, open the borders, collapse the borders, we'll put that map back up please, for TV viewers, collapse the borders of Europe,
[27:46.400 --> 27:55.400]  and then have a Wahhabist-Muslim brotherhood invasion up through the Middle East, up out of Africa, into Europe, and conquer that way, that was the deal.
[27:55.400 --> 28:10.400]  Trump and patriots in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and now in England and other areas are putting the kibosh on that, but now we face the Iran projection as well, and you've got Turkey triple dealing in the middle of it.
[28:10.400 --> 28:21.400]  That's why this is so important, with Russia threatening military retaliation. Will Russia launch military retaliation? That's the big question they've pledged they will.
[28:21.400 --> 28:29.400]  We'll see, Trump followed through on his promise to attack, infowars.com, newswars.com, live coverage throughout the evening, right here at infowars.com.

[33:18.400 --> 33:27.400]  We are live on this Sunday afternoon evening transmission. We have U.S. strikes taking place in multiple areas of Syria.
[33:27.400 --> 33:44.400]  You have Trump earlier in the week pledging that if Assad's forces in Syria began to push out the last al-Qaeda ISIS areas that they believe that would cause a humanitarian disaster in a city of more than a million people where they're dug in.
[33:44.400 --> 33:53.400]  Trump has promised strikes if that happened. Well, now strikes have begun to happen not just in one location but are being reported now in multiple areas of Syria.
[33:53.400 --> 34:00.400]  We're tracking the latest on that at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[34:00.400 --> 34:12.400]  Now, months ago, going back to April and then through to just a few months ago, the Russians have threatened to shoot down aircraft, shoot down missiles and target where they were launched from.
[34:12.400 --> 34:23.400]  If the, quote, sovereign government of Syria and its military trying to rid the country in their words of outside invaders are attacked.
[34:23.400 --> 34:31.400]  I want to be clear. I see Assad and I see Russia's view. It's Russia's only deepwater port in the Mediterranean.
[34:31.400 --> 34:40.400]  They're only port period in the Mediterranean. Syria did not start this war like Obama did seven years ago funding al-Qaeda and the Arab Spring.
[34:40.400 --> 34:52.400]  Trump spoke out against this as a candidate and said it was wrong and the deals have been made to let the Russians come in to help kick al-Qaeda and ISIS out to send them back to places like Chechnya and Saudi Arabia who were behind this invasion.
[34:52.400 --> 35:07.400]  And those are the facts. Does that mean I love Assad? No. Does that mean I don't understand that Iran is now coming into the vacuum taking over Syria and that now the Pentagon is worried about ISIS and al-Qaeda but also Iran and it's creating a vacuum where they come in?
[35:07.400 --> 35:19.400]  Yes. We understand the geopolitical ramifications of this and I understand what the Pentagon sees. I understand, you know, the larger issues.
[35:19.400 --> 35:24.400]  Mainstream media will just say Assad's bad. He's got chemical weapons. Take him out.
[35:24.400 --> 35:36.400]  Well, our own military, when this all kicked off six plus years ago said no, we're not going to turn the country over to al-Qaeda and ISIS to murder all the non-radical Muslims and Christians and others in one of the most tolerant Muslim countries in the world.
[35:36.400 --> 35:43.400]  That was a good thing that happened. And it gets into complex history and I've been jumping back into the past and back to the present.
[35:43.400 --> 35:53.400]  But I do see why Trump is saying you go into that major city of a lib and you try to drive out the al-Qaeda and ISIS forces and you carpet bomb that city.
[35:53.400 --> 36:01.400]  It's going to be a huge humanitarian disaster. So they created this red line that Obama created saying if you use chemical weapons, we will attack Assad.
[36:01.400 --> 36:09.400]  Every time Assad's about to win, al-Qaeda and ISIS get caught staging the chemical attacks. And for TV viewers, you can roll some of that footage if you want.
[36:09.400 --> 36:20.400]  For radio listeners, even British news, even German news, this year had to admit, okay, nobody was nerve-gassed in the last chemical attack in April on April 13th that led to Trump striking on the 14th.
[36:20.400 --> 36:29.400]  I mean, it's staged videos. It's kids told to be that they get food if they went and played as actors. That doesn't mean I'm saying everything as actors.
[36:29.400 --> 36:36.400]  But the Middle East is famous for staging dead babies and incubators and stuff like that.
[36:36.400 --> 36:46.400]  And even mainstream news shows Al Jazeera caught staging dead kids and it's just something that goes on over there.
[36:46.400 --> 36:51.400]  Very, very dirty pool. Massive, massive manipulation.
[36:51.400 --> 36:59.400]  So my big concern here is that Trump's going to get roped into a wider war over there, that Russia's going to respond.
[36:59.400 --> 37:05.400]  And that's going to lead to a bigger humanitarian crisis, military crisis, and also a new world war.
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.400]  Because if Russia really starts shooting down U.S. aircraft, they've got the missiles to do it.
[37:09.400 --> 37:20.400]  And if they really start attacking bases and platforms where those are fired from, that would not be good for anybody because it could turn into a nuclear war very, very quickly.
[37:20.400 --> 37:28.400]  That said, we know Trump's being advised, if you look at the map, that Iran is in control of southern Iraq.
[37:28.400 --> 37:37.400]  They're able to come through and then into Syria and into Turkey and then into Albania and other areas and control Europe.
[37:37.400 --> 37:39.400]  Saudi Arabia's already been trying that.
[37:39.400 --> 37:43.400]  And the Pentagon, before Trump even got in, blocked Obama doing it.
[37:43.400 --> 37:45.400]  That was good. I was proud of the Pentagon.
[37:45.400 --> 37:52.400]  I was proud of the generals. I was proud of Senator Paul and Senator Cruz and Colonel Shaffer and myself in Info Wars.
[37:52.400 --> 37:56.400]  And you, the audience and the current former military that said no.
[37:56.400 --> 38:04.400]  But now we're in a new ballgame where the Al Qaeda and ISIS forces have all been defeated.
[38:04.400 --> 38:12.400]  And so the argument is, Iran, you are causing major problems.
[38:12.400 --> 38:18.400]  You are not leaving. You're going into Lebanon. You're doing all these things to Israel. You have to go.
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.400]  And they're not doing that.
[38:21.400 --> 38:27.400]  So it's a giant proxy war with the Iranian forces and they're Syrian allies.
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.400]  That's in pink if you're looking at the TV screen.
[38:30.400 --> 38:36.400]  Then you've got the Kurdish forces that want to control the oil in their own areas up there in the north.
[38:36.400 --> 38:42.400]  You've got all the other Al Qaeda affiliated group.
[38:42.400 --> 38:49.400]  You've got rebels that are, again, just not saying they're ISIS or Al Qaeda, but they are still the same group.
[38:49.400 --> 38:54.400]  You've got Turkish forces threatening to come in out of the north because they don't want the Kurds getting in control.
[38:54.400 --> 38:56.400]  They want to dominate their flank, obviously.
[38:56.400 --> 39:01.400]  You've got Russia with its bases trying to aid the mainline Syrian military.
[39:01.400 --> 39:09.400]  And then you've got the U.S. bases around the country that are basically trying to get Assad.
[39:09.400 --> 39:11.400]  We put that map back up full screen please.
[39:11.400 --> 39:19.400]  Trying to get Assad to go along with the deal he made six years ago with the Pentagon to bypass the criminal war crime Obama was engaging in,
[39:19.400 --> 39:29.400]  turning the entire region over to the Al Qaeda, Wahhabist forces, and his deal with the Muslim Brotherhood, which is Wahhabist, which is Sunni and Saudi Arabia.
[39:29.400 --> 39:37.400]  So you've got a proxy war between Iran, that's 20% of the Muslim population, and I don't mean technically in Iran.
[39:37.400 --> 39:43.400]  I mean, there is the Shiite command base, the Islamic State of Shiite, that's 20% of Islam worldwide.
[39:43.400 --> 39:56.400]  And then you've got 79% of the world's Islamists that are Sunni, and that's all based in Saudi Arabia and worldwide, and then 1% of the Salawite.
[39:56.400 --> 40:05.400]  So again, you have Iran and Saudi Arabia who hate each other, who've been battling over control of Islam for 15, 1600 years since it started.
[40:05.400 --> 40:10.400]  You've got them, I guess 1450 years, they've been battling over control.
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.400]  And now they're using Iraq as a proxy war, and now they're using Syria as a proxy war.
[40:16.400 --> 40:21.400]  And now Turkey's going with its own radical form of Islam as well, more aligned with Saudi Arabia.
[40:21.400 --> 40:25.400]  And the whole thing is just turning into a giant powder keg.
[40:25.400 --> 40:32.400]  So if you want to tune into a show that's real simple, it just says Assad bad, Iran bad, Saudi Arabia bad, that's not the broadcast.
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.400]  Here we're actually getting into the forces that are involved.
[40:36.400 --> 40:43.400]  And I understand why Trump is being advised by the Pentagon to not let Iran now have full control of the country.
[40:43.400 --> 40:54.400]  Because also Turkey has said they will invade that area in northwest Syria if the United States turns it completely over to either one of the other two groups.
[40:54.400 --> 41:05.400]  Turkey says it's in its interest all the way up from the north with Kurdistan, right down up to northwestern Syria and the Mediterranean to control that area.
[41:05.400 --> 41:15.400]  I don't like Ergun, I don't like what he's doing, but the reason you see all this heating up is because all these different forces are jockeying for control of that area
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.400]  because they're based on conquest, not on renaissance.
[41:19.400 --> 41:27.400]  And it's why the Islamic world, whether it's North Africa or the Middle East or Indonesia, none of them can get along, they're always killing each other.
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.400]  Women are slaves, gays are thrown off buildings.
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.400]  They are not compatible with civilization.
[41:33.400 --> 41:35.400]  And the biggest victim of Islam is Islam.
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.400]  So why is the left in Europe and everywhere else allied with Islam?
[41:39.400 --> 41:48.400]  And the reason they're allied with Islam, there's a report on infowars.com from Leo Zagami that's so powerful that makes you understand it all.
[41:48.400 --> 41:53.400]  Report EU intentionally collapsing European countries with illegals.
[41:53.400 --> 42:03.400]  And it gets into the Kalargi plan developed by the original person that developed the EU plan, even for the Nazis.
[42:03.400 --> 42:09.400]  And that was Richard Cloudhofen Kalargi.
[42:09.400 --> 42:19.400]  And they had a plan to merge Europe with Islam and the Muslims for a global super state that would then take over the planet.
[42:19.400 --> 42:31.400]  Because if Europe merged with Islam, then Islam could take over all of Eastern Europe, all of Middle East, all of Africa, all of Central Asia, all of East Asia, all of Russia,
[42:31.400 --> 42:42.400]  and then basically dominate the globe if you had the European know-how science and technology with the giant ballooning Islamic population that he predicted would be in the billions and is now in the billions.
[42:42.400 --> 43:01.400]  Everyone should see this report at infowars.com. I can't tweet it out. I'm totally banned. You have to do it.
[43:12.400 --> 43:26.400]  My bullying children and Islamophobia. And then, voila, two weeks later ban infowars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.

[44:59.400 --> 45:13.400]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[45:13.400 --> 45:26.400]  eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.400 --> 45:37.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[45:37.400 --> 45:51.400]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:51.400 --> 45:59.400]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[47:12.400 --> 47:25.400]  You know, it's really breathtaking as I sit here live on this Sunday afternoon broadcasting worldwide to see US forces now bombing Syria again and undoubtedly killing Russian forces.
[47:25.400 --> 47:33.400]  And to see mainstream media saying that Trump has been soft on Russia when nobody's been tougher on him, but that's the upside down world we live in.
[47:33.400 --> 47:45.400]  And it's breathtaking to know every major libertarian or conservative or nationalist person I talked to has either been shadow banned or completely banned off of one or more or all platforms.
[47:45.400 --> 47:54.400]  The media, the corporate media has made a big deal about me being the platform almost off of everything in a concerted criminal effort that should frighten anybody that wants to live in a free country.
[47:54.400 --> 48:01.400]  And they've done that because they first built me into a straw man and demonized me, hoping you would accept the censorship.
[48:01.400 --> 48:07.400]  But there's been a big backlash and James Woods and others have come out to my defense just the last few hours.
[48:07.400 --> 48:13.400]  But it's not enough, ladies and gentlemen, because it's being done to everyone that I know.
[48:13.400 --> 48:23.400]  Yes, they've taken me off more than 30 platforms now. So I'm the most banned in the world outside of communist China, where Google and Apple and others help suppress the population there.
[48:23.400 --> 48:26.400]  It's incredible. There's even congressional hearings about it.
[48:26.400 --> 48:38.400]  But the big takeaway is that mainstream corporate media, the Democratic Party and big tech are all in collusion with the Chinese government and the EU and others to do this.
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.400]  It is nothing less than criminal and outrageous and insane.
[48:43.400 --> 48:59.400]  And just today, one of many people banned is Chris Tonto Peranto, who we're getting on the show tomorrow. Good friend of mine, hero of Benghazi and Obama came out to speech and said Benghazi is a conspiracy theory.
[48:59.400 --> 49:02.400]  It didn't even happen.
[49:02.400 --> 49:13.400]  And Chris came out and said, I lost a lot of friends on that roof. We got attacked. How dare you say it didn't happen. In fact, later the next hour, we'll put a video of Obama saying it's a conspiracy theory.
[49:13.400 --> 49:20.400]  Obama ordered the stand down. So he's the guy who literally along with Hillary got these people killed.
[49:20.400 --> 49:28.400]  And then they turned it around and ban him with a one day suspension saying he bullied someone in a protected group.
[49:28.400 --> 49:39.400]  Well, Chris is Hispanic. They say Obama's African. But no, the real protection group is a globalist is a Democrat, just like the CNN reporter that was getting me banned everywhere.
[49:39.400 --> 49:49.400]  I confronted him and said you're a scumbag, which he is. And then they banned me off the iTunes app and Twitter in the next two days saying I bullied a protected group.
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.400]  It's unbelievable. Benghazi is a conspiracy at Barack Obama.
[49:54.400 --> 50:10.400]  Question mark. How about you do this? Let's put your cowardly ass on the top of a roof with six of your buddies and shoot RPGs and AK-47s at you while terrorists lob 81 millimeter mortars killing two of your buddies all waiting for U.S. air support for 13 hours you never sent.
[50:10.400 --> 50:17.400]  Hashtag scum. He almost got killed by Obama. His friends got killed. They were proven to be liars.
[50:17.400 --> 50:25.400]  And when they're done, they say screw you. You're not even human, Chris.
[50:25.400 --> 50:35.400]  Mr. Peranto, crawl on a ditch and die. We're going to kick you off Twitter because first it's a seven, first it's a one day suspension than a seven day, then they ban you like me.
[50:35.400 --> 50:41.400]  And they're banning everybody and it's criminal and it's evil and it's abusive and you can't even criticize known public figures.
[50:41.400 --> 50:48.400]  This is the actual thing that came in Friday night from Apple. Your app includes content that could be considered defamatory by them.
[50:48.400 --> 50:55.400]  It's all subjective or mean spirited and appears to humiliate, intimidate or place a targeted individual or group in harm's way.
[50:55.400 --> 51:01.400]  And they said the CNN reporter Mark Dice absolutely blows it out of the water.
[51:01.400 --> 51:06.400]  But thank God James Woods has come out and said banning Alex Jones from the Internet is a slippery slope.
[51:06.400 --> 51:12.400]  The beginning of the real fascism. Trust me. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:12.400 --> 51:18.400]  This is the beginning of the real fascism here in America and James Woods is absolutely right.
[51:18.400 --> 51:25.400]  And it's happening to everybody that wants capitalism or who wants free market and who's well spoken and the left and anti fucking all call for killing us.
[51:25.400 --> 51:34.400]  They can have official apps and be on Twitter and they can you can have all these radical Islamic groups and ISIS and Al-Qaeda can have Twitter's and all these other criminal groups can do it.
[51:34.400 --> 51:41.400]  But I can't and veterans can't. They're talking about taking it away from Trump. This is an outrageous authoritarian power grab.
[51:41.400 --> 51:45.400]  Mark Dice blew it out of the water. Here is his report.
[51:45.400 --> 51:49.400]  As you probably heard Alex Jones was permanently banned from Twitter yesterday.
[51:49.400 --> 51:57.400]  But there are six levels of irony to the story that everybody should be aware of because what happened here is horrifying.
[51:57.400 --> 52:06.400]  Twitter said that it was because he was bullying a CNN reporter. That's literally the reason that they gave the Associated Press reports.
[52:06.400 --> 52:13.400]  Twitter said Jones posted a video on Wednesday that violates the company's policy against abusive behavior.
[52:13.400 --> 52:23.400]  That video showed Jones berating CNN journalist Oliver Darcy all for some 10 minutes in between two congressional hearings on social media.
[52:23.400 --> 52:29.400]  So the first level of irony here is that Jones bullied a reporter who's a public figure.
[52:29.400 --> 52:35.400]  Second level is that reporter was working in the capacity of a reporter.
[52:35.400 --> 52:40.400]  It wasn't like he was out to dinner with his family or being harassed at a grocery store.
[52:40.400 --> 52:42.400]  He was working as a reporter.
[52:42.400 --> 52:48.400]  The third level is he was a public figure working in capacity of being a reporter on public property.
[52:48.400 --> 52:53.400]  The fourth level of irony is that reporter was covering Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey,
[52:53.400 --> 52:57.400]  testifying in front of Congress about social media censorship.
[52:57.400 --> 53:06.400]  The fifth level of irony here is that very reporter is the same one who had been tattling on Alex for months to Twitter and YouTube and Facebook,
[53:06.400 --> 53:12.400]  digging through their tweets and their videos and then contacting the social media giants and then saying,
[53:12.400 --> 53:17.400]  well, doesn't this violate your terms of service? Doesn't this? Why haven't you banned him yet?
[53:17.400 --> 53:24.400]  The sixth level of irony is that you're not allowed to post the video of Alex denouncing the reporter on Twitter,
[53:24.400 --> 53:28.400]  or you too will be banned for violating their terms of service,
[53:28.400 --> 53:35.400]  as Paul Joseph Watson discovered who was suspended yesterday, thankfully only temporarily,
[53:35.400 --> 53:38.400]  for literally posting the video. That's right.
[53:38.400 --> 53:45.400]  You're not even allowed to show why someone was banned so that others could look at the material and decide whether or not this was an overreach or not.
[53:45.400 --> 53:49.400]  You're just supposed to take their word for it. He was bullying a reporter.
[53:49.400 --> 53:57.400]  I guess Twitter's going to start banning everyone at Trump rallies who chants CNN sucks to Jim Acosta because that's bullying too.
[53:57.400 --> 54:06.400]  Of course, liberals posting video of themselves harassing Trump administration officials in their private lives while they're having dinner with their families and restaurants.
[54:06.400 --> 54:16.400]  That's okay. But Alex Jones telling off a CNN reporter in public while he's on the job at an event about social media censorship.
[54:16.400 --> 54:19.400]  That's not allowed. That's where we're at right now.
[54:19.400 --> 54:27.400]  Of course, CNN's stalking and harassing that poor 70-year-old woman who happened to share something on Facebook that was originally posted by the Russians.
[54:27.400 --> 54:35.400]  That's okay. Oh, by the way, I received an email yesterday morning from Twitter saying that someone filed a complaint against something that I posted,
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.400]  and they had investigated it, but thankfully they found that it was not in violation of their terms of service.
[54:41.400 --> 54:48.400]  And guess what it was? Oh, it was my parody of little Brian Stelter that I had posted a week and a half ago.
[54:48.400 --> 54:57.400]  Gee, what a coincidence. Oh, wait, what's this? Oh, it's the video in question of Alex Jones bullying that poor reporter. Let's take a look.
[54:57.400 --> 55:05.400]  Look at this right here. The guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong.
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.400]  There's no censorship in conservatives or patriots. You are incredibly shameful.
[55:09.400 --> 55:10.400]  How are you doing, Alex?
[55:10.400 --> 55:19.400]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward. You're going to go down the history books at the Criminal News Network.
[55:19.400 --> 55:24.400]  Wow, he called them shameful and a coward. How dare you, Alex? You're banned for life.
[55:24.400 --> 55:32.400]  Of course, just showing you that clip is putting my career at risk because YouTube may say that I showed the forbidden video that's been banned,
[55:32.400 --> 55:36.400]  and issue me a community guideline strike for bullying this poor guy.
[55:36.400 --> 55:42.400]  Alex wasn't even yelling at him. He wasn't getting in his face and bumping chess with them like he was going to get into a fight.
[55:42.400 --> 55:47.400]  He was just telling them off for tattling on some of their previous tweets.
[55:47.400 --> 55:49.400]  Look at this. He openly admits it.
[55:49.400 --> 55:55.400]  Facebook invited me to an event today where the company aimed to tout its commitment to fighting fake news and misinformation.
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.400]  I asked them, why is Infowars still out on the platform?
[55:59.400 --> 56:01.400]  I didn't get a good answer.
[56:01.400 --> 56:05.400]  And then there's this after Alex was wiped from all the other platforms just last month.
[56:05.400 --> 56:14.400]  It's important to note that tech platforms did not enforce their own rules and take action against Alex Jones and Infowars on their own accord.
[56:14.400 --> 56:23.400]  It took media outlets to point out for weeks that Infowars was skirting the rules on these tech platforms for them to enforce their standards.
[56:23.400 --> 56:29.400]  It was you. You were pointing out the tweets. You were crying to Twitter and YouTube and everybody else.
[56:29.400 --> 56:32.400]  Look at what he's doing. He's breaking the rules.
[56:32.400 --> 56:34.400]  Literally, there's six levels of irony here.
[56:34.400 --> 56:42.400]  He's a reporter, a public figure working in the capacity as a reporter on public property at an event about social media censorship.
[56:42.400 --> 56:46.400]  The very guy who got Alex Jones and Infowars banned from all the other platforms.
[56:46.400 --> 56:50.400]  And if you post this video, then you too may be banned.
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.400]  Mark Dice.com doing a great job. See all his videos there at markdice.com.
[56:54.400 --> 56:57.400]  Now, we're going to end this transmission.
[56:57.400 --> 57:05.400]  There's going to be the whole second hour of the broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m. today with Owen Schreuer and these key reports, the latest on the war news in Syria.
[57:05.400 --> 57:08.400]  But the big news is James Woods is right.
[57:08.400 --> 57:12.400]  We're going into fascism. Baining me was very, very dangerous, very, very evil.
[57:12.400 --> 57:14.400]  Now it's happening to heroes of Benghazi.
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.400]  What will we put up with?
[57:16.400 --> 57:19.400]  That's really the big question in closing.

[59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.400]  It did not start with Donald Trump.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:07.400]  He is a symptom, not the cause.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:16.400]  So when you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:34.400]  I mean, I'm glad it's continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that's been going on,
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:43.400]  when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, and suddenly Republicans are saying it's a miracle,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:55.400]  I had to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  He said, what do you think of President Obama's speech?
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:08.400]  And I said, I'm sorry, I watched it, but I fell asleep.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:15.400]  I found he's very good, very good for sleeping.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:22.400]  Barack Hussein Obama, the first president in US history to not attain 3% GDP growth,
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:29.400]  even though he had eight years to do it, a president who spent so much, he slowed any growth he was generating.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  The national debt grew from $11.5 trillion to $20 trillion under Obama, as did the misery index by 53%.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.400]  Food stamp recipients rose by a staggering 42%.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:51.400]  Ironically, gun manufacturing boomed under the UN gun grabbing rhetoric of Barack Obama by 192%.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:59.400]  People have been beaten down so, and they feel so betrayed by government.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:09.400]  It's not surprising, man, that they get fed up with their guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like that.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.400]  And we're explaining their frustrations.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:21.400]  But we are all supposed to believe that the current roaring economy is due to Obama's economic recovery strategy,
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:28.400]  not President Trump's corporate tax cuts or the reopening of factories humming the tune made in America again.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.400]  Made in the USA, made in America, it's back.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  Let's take a look at Obama's recovery. Forbes Magazine wrote in 2013,
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:44.400]  This clears that Obama-nomics has produced the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.400]  Worse than what every other president who has faced a recession has achieved since the Great Depression.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.400]  Some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.400]  And as job numbers rose out of the Bush recession with Obama and Trump seemingly neck and neck,
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  the industries the two presidents have affected are very different.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:12.400]  Quartz's comparison indicates while Trump is dominated in mining, metals, machinery, computers, and oil and gas extraction,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:21.400]  Obama's jobs were in storage, travel, and two cyclical dying industries, department stores, and Hollywood.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:32.400]  I'm going to say one thing. Trump.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:46.400]  Not to mention that during the last election cycle, Obama said that none of Trump's predictions were possible.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:55.400]  If Obama is truly responsible for 2018's economic growth, wouldn't he have predicted that growth when he had had the chance?
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:05.400]  When somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.400]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What are you going to do? There's no answer to it.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:19.400]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal. Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:26.400]  What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is you don't have an answer.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:35.400]  The Democrats are thankfully chaining themselves to a flaming pile of bullshit that most Americans can smell a mile away.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.400]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.400]  You should reject these voices.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.400]  John Bound reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:54.400]  Yeah, if they think former President Hussein Obama is going to redeem the blue wave, they got another thing coming.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:09.400]  We'll be right back with the Alex Jones show.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:36.400]  Infowars Life's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:51.400]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:58.400]  Head to InfowarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:30.400]  I have not watched any of the NFL today, but it did kick off.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.400]  Ratings were down 13% from the NFL kickoff this week.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.400]  My guess is they'll be down again today.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:50.400]  And that's just what you get when you want to use an anti-American bent to your marketing and to your product.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:57.400]  So what are people actually talking about instead of the bread and circus modern day gladiators?
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.400]  They're talking about censorship on the Internet.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:06.400]  And I'm going to open up the phone lines now for your calls for the entirety of the second hour.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.400]  Also covering some news.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.400]  1-877-789-Alex is the number to call.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:25.400]  But people aren't talking about football, people aren't really talking about the sports and the pop cultures anymore, entertainment, television ratings are down, sports ratings are down.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:43.400]  And you have this new phenomenon happening where a guy like Mark Dice or Candace Owens can go on the Internet and do a video and get hundreds of thousands and millions of views.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:52.400]  In fact, I don't even believe if we even covered Candace Owens last video where she goes down to Florida and covers the immigration center.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.400]  Unbelievably powerful video.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:06.400]  Just totally shatters the false narrative that the Democrats are leading on about the treatment of immigrants at these facilities or by President Trump.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:15.400]  And you go watch this video and if this video got 300 million views and every American saw this video, it would be game over.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:27.400]  Just like if every American could see Obama arguing with himself over the jobs market and then saying it can't happen and taking credit at the same times, maybe America could wake up.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.400]  So what do we need to do about the censorship? How do we beat this?
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:41.400]  Look, I love President Trump. The guy has brought me to tears. He's made me laugh. I mean, it's just been an unbelievable ride under President Trump.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:50.400]  But you know, Hillary Clinton is still walking free and he said in his campaign that the voices, the unheard voices, you're not unheard anymore.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:09:01.400]  Well, wait a second. We're literally not being heard anymore. I mean, they're shutting us down. I've got the Resolution Center message from Apple right now.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.400]  And so we're going to cover all that. We're going to take all your calls. But folks, here's the thing.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.400]  I thank God that Alex had the foresight to create InfowarsStore.com because let me explain something.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:21.400]  A lot of other people out there, and this is the censorship on the Internet with YouTube and Twitter and Facebook, Centering Conservatives.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:28.400]  A lot of those people that are being demonetized, they don't work for Infowars. They don't have InfowarsStore.com to back them.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:37.400]  They don't have the Alex Jones audience of millions of people to back them, the greatest audience in my recollection, in the world.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:45.400]  So there's a lot of people out there who used to make money doing YouTube and doing their thing on social media that are now banned.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:56.400]  Now, luckily, we have InfowarsStore.com and your support maintains our ability to exist and continue broadcasting despite them erasing us off the Internet.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:06.400]  So we continue to sit here, even though they box us in and broadcast out at Infowars.com slash show and all of our radio stations and television syndicates,
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.400]  even though they're blocking us on the number one main vein for traffic and media consumption, the Internet.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:21.400]  But that's fine because your support at InfowarsStore.com maintains and it's how we're able to expand despite the censorship where most people would be contracting.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:31.400]  So the Labor Day specials are actually extended. This is incredible. 50% off many of the top selling supplements, including Ultimate Bone Broth, BOD Ease, Knockout Sleep Aid.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:39.400]  It's all at InfowarsStore.com. We've got household items like toothpaste and shampoo, all natural. Try those out.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:45.400]  We've got the next level Mouth Washes here and it's 50% off Super Blue Immune Gargle today.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:53.400]  I'm proud to bring you a powerful dental and palate cleanse with Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle. All sizes combo available at 50% off.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:11:02.400]  You can stock up and take some to go for a portable and at home multi-purpose formula. It is the Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle All Sizes Combo.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  So you've got the large bottle there and then you've got the one you can take on the road.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.400]  And while you're getting that, don't forget about Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  The deals at InfowarsStore.com right now are pretty much as good as it gets when it comes to 50% off top selling supplements, 5 star rated supplements, like the real red pill.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and just remember, it's because of this audience, it's because of your support that we can beat this censorship and at least exist.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:43.400]  And, you know, you just think about, I mean, you want to talk about a defamation case.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:51.400]  Right now you've got Roy Moore suing Sasha Baron Cohen. I think the number is like $97 million defamation case.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:12:03.400]  Defamation suits are the hardest to win. And so if you're going to do a defamation suit, you throw out a massive figure and hope that the person you're suing just backs off.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:22.400]  But Alex, to me, has the easiest case to win for a defamation suit because we can actually show you the financial hit we've taken to the tunes of tens of millions of dollars since they banned us off of all the marketplace sharing on Google,
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:42.400]  since they banned us from monetizing videos on YouTube. So we can actually present a physical number to the tunes of millions of dollars how their defamation against Alex Jones has actually hurt him as a character, character assassination and actually hurt us financially.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.400]  But it's your support at InfowarsStore.com that just makes Alex chug forward and not look back.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:55.400]  And so that's what Alex Jones does. And we've got huge specials, the Labor Day specials are extended.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:03.400]  And I just thank the audience. Don't forget about InfowarsStore.com. That's what they want you to do. This is all about financially crippling us folks.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:17.400]  And there's other stuff going on behind the scenes. I don't know if Alex is going to ever talk about it, but just the lengths that they're going to try to financially handicap us, you wouldn't even believe.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:22.400]  It's like the tip of the iceberg thing. Like the censorship is really just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.400]  And then you got the lawsuits and all the other crap that goes on. It's just unbelievable.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:36.400]  But your support is steadfast at InfowarsStore.com. So the Labor Day specials have been extended 50% off half of the supplements at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  Now, there is a lot of news that we need to get into, including the U.S. strikes in Syria have begun and Russia has vowed retaliation.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:14:05.400]  Now, this is when you talk about the geopolitics and whatever the oil wars, whatever you want to call it, illegal wars, false wars, wars that will lead to bigger wars.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:13.400]  This is it right now. Syria is the powder keg. And it's been the powder keg.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:27.400]  You see, on September 11, 2001, when the government and the news told us that Osama bin Laden and radical Islamic terrorists took down the Twin Towers,
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:35.400]  there was a plan in place to invade the Middle East and to bring the Jewish central banks to the Middle East.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:46.400]  Syria is one of the last dominoes to fall. They got Iraq, they got Afghanistan, they got the other pieces moving into place that they didn't have to invade.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:51.400]  They got Libya and some of the other dominoes fell into place so they didn't have to invade.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:15:01.400]  Egypt is an example. It just goes on and on. There's General Wesley Clark before they banned that on YouTube.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  It's got millions of views. Seven countries in five years. That was the plan you saw. Syria is the last domino to fall.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:18.400]  Russia's not going to allow it. Trump wasn't going to fall for it, but it looks like they're going to pigeonhole him into going into war in Syria
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:24.400]  with war hawks like Nikki Haley behind it and war mongers like John Bolton,
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:32.400]  who we think was the man behind the New York Times op-ed piece praising John McCain.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:39.400]  And why would they want Infowars to be banned off the Internet when they go into Syria and lie about what's going on with Syria?
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.400]  See, the American people in general are sick of wars. They're sick of foreign interventions.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  They know Infowars is the only big news network out there that's going to cover it. Fox News will be just fine with the war in Syria,
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:56.400]  at least 90% of the hosts. Infowars won't be, so they have to erase this off the Internet to let everyone go along with more war.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:05.400]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:14.400]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from InfowarsStore.com,
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:23.400]  you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:38.400]  You cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.400]  and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.

[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:46.400]  Don't forget about us as they're trying to erase us from the Internet.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:53.400]  Now, we've got a lot of callers calling in about the censorship issue. Before I go to your calls, let me address some of the latest news.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:21:02.400]  First, let me read for you the message we got from Apple when they took down our app.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:09.400]  Now, this was wild because I actually was not... I didn't even know this was going on.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:19.400]  But I'm playing basketball when this happens. I go home and I'm getting ready to do my own broadcast on The War Room Show's Twitter page
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:29.400]  because I had to address YouTube kicking me off YouTube banning my personal channel when I wasn't even doing anything and I caught YouTube in a lie.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:36.400]  So I was going to go do a live video on The War Room Show's Twitter. Right before I went live, I got banned from doing a live video on that.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.400]  So then I had to turn around and do it on my Twitter account.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:48.400]  And I did this and I didn't even know that Apple had kicked us off its platform as an app.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.400]  And so I'm just doing this live broadcast and be like, hey, did you hear Apple kicked you guys off?
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.400]  And I didn't even know that that had happened.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:00.400]  So this is next level. Alex Jones is calling it Internet Martial Law.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.400]  Let me read for you the message from the Apple Resolution Center.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:10.400]  We are writing to notify you that your application has been removed from the App Store because it is not in compliance with the App Store review guidelines.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:15.400]  Oh, guideline 111, safety objectionable content.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:25.400]  Your app includes content that could be considered defamatory or mean-spirited and appears to humiliate, intimidate, or place a targeted individual or group in harm's way.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.400]  Well, now wait a second.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.400]  Half of the channels on YouTube would have to be gone.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  Okay, but I guess we're talking about Apple, but it's the same difference than the YouTube app.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.400]  Can't be on Apple, right?
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  How much objectionable content is on YouTube?
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.400]  How about the Twitter app?
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.400]  How much objectionable content is on Twitter?
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:51.400]  So once again, this is total bull crap.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.400]  Here's what I wish.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:57.400]  I wish that the people in charge of these companies would just be honest.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.400]  I just wish they weren't such liars, but they are.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.400]  Why don't you just be honest and say, look, Alex Jones' message, we don't like it.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:12.400]  We don't like infowars politics, and we don't like the fact that Alex Jones is so popular and he's beating us.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:21.400]  And he's beating our corporate news, one man, one audience, destroying narratives, taking America back.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:27.400]  If they could just come out and admit that, I would have a little bit of respect for him.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.400]  But they won't even admit it.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.400]  They're going to be total liars through and through.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:37.400]  And they think that the population is so stupid that you're not even going to see it.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.400]  You're not going to see the blatant censorship being done as a political agenda.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.400]  And so then what do they say?
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:52.400]  In a Yahoo news story, in the US, a lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:56.400]  That's why Alex Jones and infowars were too dangerous not to be banned.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400]  Oh, but wait a second.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]  Who's actually getting violent?
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.400]  It's the left.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]  Who got shot?
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.400]  Steve Scalise, a Republican by a radical leftist.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:11.400]  It's the left getting violent with people like Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi telling them to do so.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.400]  So it's total BS.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.400]  Everyone knows it's BS.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  The censorship is 100% political.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.400]  And I just wish companies like Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter weren't such liars about it.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.400]  But they are liars because that's what they are.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.400]  And that's what they'll always be.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.400]  So let's now go to your calls on this issue.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.400]  Let's go to Chase the Patriot calling in from California on a major issue.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.400]  Hero of Benghazi, suspended from Twitter for criticizing Obama.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:43.400]  Chris Tonto Peranto, you've probably seen him before on TV, heard about him.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.400]  The Benghazi hero.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.400]  He's now off Twitter because he gets suspended.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  He's not allowed to have political speech against Obama.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.400]  So you're not allowed to talk about Obama.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.400]  You're not allowed to talk about anything unless it's okay with the establishment big brother.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.400]  That's where we're at.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.400]  Chase the Patriot in California.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400]  Go ahead.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.400]  Hey, what's happening there?
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.400]  Chase the Patriot checking in there.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.400]  Hey, I'm glad you guys are having them on the show tomorrow.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.400]  This is really one of those moments where people have to pay attention.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:18.400]  If they're going to attack a hero of the war, you know, a hero of Benghazi and just try to erase the story like it never even happened.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.400]  I want to alarm everybody to the next level of censorship.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.400]  See, right now they're censoring people.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.400]  They're censoring websites.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.400]  But next it's going to be the information themselves and the words themselves.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  And here's how they're doing.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  Well, that's really what it already is.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.400]  It's just under the facade of doing it to people.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  But that's already what it is.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  But Owen, the next generation right now is what everybody needs to be alarmed to.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:50.400]  Across the country, every public school is giving every kid a Chromebook because Google has lowered the price
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.400]  and basically given them free Chromebooks.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  And now they don't use encyclopedias.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400]  They don't read books.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  Everything they learn comes from the Google search.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  50 million children are in our public school system right now.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  And they're getting one-sided arguments.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  And this is one of those moments where we can alarm all the military and all parents
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.400]  that they're attacking our military and they're attacking our children's minds right now.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.400]  And people aren't even aware.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.400]  You know what though, this is actually interesting because I wonder now,
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400]  I'll need to do a little more research into this,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:30.400]  if Google is working with the United States government and using their technology in public schools
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.400]  now all of a sudden, how is it that Google can get away with this censorship?
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.400]  How is it that Google can...
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.400]  I mean, this is basically, like you're saying, they're now taking complete control of our destiny
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.400]  where they're now going to decide what the youth of the nation can and can't see.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400]  So how is it Google is even allowed to do that?
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.400]  That is next level illegality.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.400]  Okay, listen, every child, I'm telling you, they will not accept homework from them
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.400]  in certain school districts unless it's turned into what's called Google classroom.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:05.400]  And everything in the hive mind of these children is getting sent into the Google central computers.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.400]  You can look it up where kids are getting punished
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.400]  because they don't want to send their homework in to the computer system
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.400]  and they're getting punished for it.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:19.400]  Now this, every parent across the country needs to wake up and look at what's happening in their public schools.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.400]  And remember, you can check me out on YouTube, ChaseThePatriot. Take care.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.400]  Thank you for the call. Wow.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.400]  I mean, just think about that folks, they are at Google, see, people don't understand,
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.400]  these companies are bigger than the government.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.400]  Google runs the school now, Google runs the information now, Google runs the internet now
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.640]  now and they're deciding what gets to exist and what does it their big brother when did
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.640]  we vote to allow Google to run this country when did we decide that Google was going to
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.880]  be the arbiter of information who decided Google was going to be the company that that
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:03.160]  takes over the schools this is unbelievable you know who it was folks Barack Obama why
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:10.800]  do you think Google had its own office basically in the West Wing see this is the kind of stuff
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:19.680]  this is why we have to take calls it's just like it's just unbelievable man how can they
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:28.920]  possibly get away with this in America I'll tell you how because the average citizen
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:35.200]  in this country is totally distracted by pop culture and sports the average citizen in
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.800]  this country is totally brainwashed and dumbed down by the chemicals in the food and water
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:49.240]  and at a very primal instinctual human level their very instincts their very information

[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:19.920]  function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:25.360]  eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:30.360]  this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:36.120]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:41.680]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:46.560]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies

[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.480]  a quick word chase the patriot left off my kids are actually in school too but uh apple
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.480]  kind of controls this area with what they call class dojo so everything's monitored
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.600]  oh okay so you get either the google control of your kids or the apple control of your
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.280]  kids both run by china so that's you know you get an option of which chinese communists
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.880]  you know you want exactly it's good to have two different flavors of chinese communism
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:04.600]  you got the apple flavor you got the google flavor yes exactly and it's complete i mean
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.920]  what they teach our children nowadays is completely just irrelevant for life and just anything
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:13.680]  that they would and now they make it even harder to homeschool your kids so so so that's
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.560]  like the overall agenda you make it impossible to homeschool your kid so you then have to
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:23.200]  send them to now the google china apple factory institutions where their kids are just going
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.400]  to learn how to be a mind slave to big tech exactly and i would like to just go ahead
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.200]  and touch off too i just would like you to know too i've actually been banned off facebook
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:38.920]  twitter and instagram and it actually all started out back in the election for president trump
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:43.360]  i can go back even to show it on facebook history i got banned three months before and actually
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.480]  even get any of my accounts back i had to show two forms of id i had to mail that into
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.800]  them wait for a response what then they responded back to me yes sir then they responded back
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:00.400]  to me and then i had to physically hand write a response to them mail it to them in order
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.680]  to get my account back and you to ban me of all things just for sharing that the old the
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:11.720]  own shreds videos because i got into it with the snowflake one day and they completely
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.640]  banned my youtube and i can see that that's the next thing that i'm wondering because
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.720]  you know there's what how many alex jones memes are there i mean there's dozens of
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:23.480]  channels that re upload my stuff and edit it up right so it's like are they going to
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.920]  start just doing that is that is that the next because you already know i mean they're
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:32.000]  already doing this if you go on facebook or twitter or youtube and re stream any infowars
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.360]  content you get banned so what's next so now if you now if you cut a video together of
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:43.840]  alex jones is that get banned if you cut a video of uh oh and shroyer in the street
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.840]  interview does that get banned where does it end where where what is the what is the one
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.800]  you know we don't discuss this we just accept it but but here's the problem again it all
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:59.160]  comes down to the fact they've got most of these people brainwashed and distracted okay
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:03.760]  but that's changing the status quo is changing but we're in a death race right now the finish
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:10.080]  line is coming up for this for this death race in 50 what is it now 53 days till the
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:17.520]  midterms or something 58 days till the midterms 58 so yeah i mean we're in a time crunch the
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.920]  final seconds are winding down in the fourth quarter for this for this big game for this
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:28.720]  battle and we have to get as many americans conscious and engage as possible if we want
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:34.120]  to have victory and it really just comes down to that folks are we going to put are we going
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:42.680]  to put the same pieces of human trash in office like elizabeth warren like nancy pelosi like
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:49.480]  maxine waters are we going to put these same garbage trash politicians in office that do
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.960]  nothing for this country are we going to elect real men and women who go in there to fight
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.120]  for america and to actually do something about the corruption in washington how is it that
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:07.080]  we vote for the same people to stop the corruption in washington who've been in washington for
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:13.520]  decades somebody explain that one to me can't it's impossible it's called stockholm syndrome
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.480]  it's called mindless sheeple zombies all right billy thank you so much for the call or just
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.080]  straight rigged elections i mean you want to get down to electronic elections totally
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:29.320]  rigged let's go to mark now in san jose go ahead mark thanks for having me in a few moments
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:38.200]  with you mr sure one way we destroy sensorism as we get him back on the airway okay he was
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:48.320]  on ko my 1340 for almost 10 years and michael's wringley owns tail of my 1340 and kfco 1080
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.680]  where rest limbaugh is on the other side and he's got a well here's the thing i'm sorry
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:56.440]  mark your your connection is bad and i don't want to it's just it's just bad sounding so
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:03.400]  i'm gonna let you go but i am going to respond to your comment here local talk radio is such
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:10.800]  an interesting bird where you what you basically have is in local talk radio you've got a situation
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:15.720]  where you've you've got somebody who owns the station that has plenty of money and the station
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:20.880]  is just there for them to really do promotion and it's kind of just a fun project for them
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.880]  maybe they like going on air and marketing and stuff like that then you've got aspects
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.240]  of talk radio that they've been around they still have the management and everything trying
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.960]  to run it but it's tougher to make money now and everybody's shows are brokered and so
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:42.280]  it's it's really all about sales and i'm just sitting here like how can you not sell the
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:48.720]  alex joneshow how can you not go and say this is banned on the internet you cannot access
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.840]  this anywhere unless you want to broadcast on your am station so i think that mark makes
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:59.480]  a good point but the talk radio market is such an interesting bird it's it's it's hard
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:05.760]  to penetrate because it is just cutthroat man i mean it is so cutthroat that industry
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.880]  and people just i mean it's just some people just struggle just to get by and you wouldn't
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:16.920]  even think it some of the biggest shows so i think if you can find the right stations
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.440]  with the right owners that could be one way to get more stations to pick up the alex
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:31.560]  joneshow but i mean i think that some people are just scared to put alex joneshow on their
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:35.000]  airwaves now you know that's that's part of the chilling effect that's part of the character
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.520]  assassination of alex jones that the media is engaged in total defamation let's take
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:44.720]  one more call before we go to this break let's go to tyler in wisconsin go ahead tyler
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:52.480]  hey what's up all in this is tyler badans here and i think you're right we need to actually
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.320]  vote with our pocketbooks here and make the economy kind of be our voice and after what
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:04.400]  apple did uh taking the info wars app out of the itunes storm i think that's like that's
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:09.360]  like the star that broke the camels back for me because they moved their servers to china
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.760]  or the clouds you know the clouds just floated over to china that's how they want to make
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:18.240]  sounds but they moved all their servers over to china and you know that's kind of like
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:23.440]  an intangible thing right that's not really effective day to day but the other day i was
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.280]  having a some bugs in the info wars app so i thought hey you know first this isn't a
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.160]  coincidence because uh you know how it goes you know so i thought maybe if i delete the
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:38.600]  app and then re-download it i could get it without any bug oh but but then you deleted
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:44.040]  it and they removed it so now you can't get it no i cannot get it and it's just like okay
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:52.520]  i think i think that tyler is on to something which people seeing the app removed is the
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:58.480]  is the straw is the awakening moment like wow this really is crazy we knew it was coming
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.880]  the whole thing was for me like first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.160]  sue us to add credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.560]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and islamophobia and then voila two weeks
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:21.200]  later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the

[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.360]  obviously taking us off the waves i think it's super important for the listeners to
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.360]  rekindle the fire of the power of meeting with each other in person and the reason why
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:01.360]  i was calling is i got one of your incognito the green info wars shirt the new incognito
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  with the octagon this is a beautiful beautiful thing you know like just wear that shirt around

[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.360]  start grassroots again meeting people in person no exactly here's the thing we either we can
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.360]  we're not censored in the 3d realm or we force them to censor us in the 3d realm which is
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.360]  what they'll do now i don't know if you've heard about the info wars army that i launched
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.360]  which has already been under threat and and just reiterate and we have this disclaimer
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.360]  we're a peaceful group we don't do anything illegal it's just totally first amendment
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.360]  so they're already attacking us and threatening us with that but that's why i started the
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.360]  info wars army because we have to go out into the third dimension now since they want to
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.360]  censor us from the internet dimension the digital world but guess what what's going to happen
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  is they're going to start censoring us in the 3d world too you watch you watch you hold

[01:51:54.360 --> 01:52:01.360]  thing is there is hope down the road there's a cryptocurrency called tron tron they are
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:06.360]  designing web 3.0 which is completely going to be owned by the people and controlled by
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:11.360]  the people so and they got billions and billions of dollars behind them so there is hope down
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:18.360]  the road and also i want to verify that your app has been removed and thirdly your products
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  are off the Richter scale there are no words describe your products on 55 today and i don't

[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:46.360]  this before we go to antonio actually you know what let's go to let's go actually go to
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:50.360]  charles because he's going to carry this point that mel just said and i've noticed this too
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.360]  now i'm not saying why this happening or if this is across the board i figured it to be
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:53:02.360]  anomalous but at my home i cannot watch info wars dot com slash show on the google chrome
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.360]  browser it will not let me it errors every time and i've had other people say the same
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.360]  thing so i have to watch it on the mozilla firefox browser at home because google won't
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:14.360]  let me play the alex joneshow charles says in georgia he's experiencing that same issue
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:19.360]  yeah well i think i figured it out what the issue is it may not be the browser causing
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:25.360]  it um anyone who has adblock or adblock plus if you have that running it hides the info
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:30.360]  wars logo the play button a lot of features that let you play videos so i believe the
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:39.360]  adblock um is causing it that's strange if you pause it it may show up all the all the
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.360]  icons and everything because that's what i did but you know that the university of my
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:49.360]  friends work they say that imports is flagged as questionable material by their it department
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:55.360]  oh yeah yeah if you're a lot of school networks that have those you know uh you know laptops
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:00.360]  or whatever and they have this this built-in system yeah yeah they'll flag stuff and you
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.360]  know you want to flag stuff if your kids are at school you know so they don't go to the
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:08.360]  websites i get that but yeah i mean they flag info wars and they don't let students go to
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:14.360]  info wars yeah yeah and i'm a web developer and anything you need oh and or anything
