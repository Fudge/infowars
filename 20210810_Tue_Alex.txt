[00:00.000 --> 00:22.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:22.760 --> 00:24.880]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:24.880 --> 00:26.920]  Well so does he.
[00:26.920 --> 00:38.440]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.840]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[00:44.840 --> 00:45.840]  that we've set.
[00:45.840 --> 00:52.600]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[00:52.600 --> 01:01.040]  just as well-funded.
[01:01.040 --> 01:09.400]  It was 13 years ago that then-Senator and candidate for president, Barack Obama, uttered
[01:09.400 --> 01:14.080]  those words in Chicago.
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.160]  And I have the Pentagon documents, I have the CDC documents, I have them all, but they're
[01:18.160 --> 01:22.280]  now official and we know who's launched it, we know how they're going to play it out and
[01:22.280 --> 01:23.640]  we know who's in command of it.
[01:23.640 --> 01:25.680]  His name is General Honor Ray.
[01:25.680 --> 01:30.640]  He locked down Louisiana and Mississippi and confiscated over 3 million firearms.
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.200]  They quartered in people's houses illegally and they shot hundreds of U.S. citizens and
[01:36.200 --> 01:37.200]  killed them.
[01:37.200 --> 01:41.760]  He has been put in full command of the martial law collapse of the U.S. and the new Civil
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.800]  War they're going to launch under the guise of the next COVID lockdown.
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.640]  And my phone started buzzing at 2 a.m. this morning and I don't normally leave my phone
[01:51.640 --> 01:58.280]  on but I had forgotten and it was Eddie Bravo sending me links saying, have you seen this?
[01:58.280 --> 02:03.040]  And I'd seen pieces of it, but they not published the whole thing on the CDC website until about
[02:03.040 --> 02:09.920]  a week ago and it's a document they produced last year in July.
[02:09.920 --> 02:15.600]  Interim operational considerations for implementing the shielding approach to prevent COVID-19
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.680]  infections in humanitarian settings, what a nice word for that.
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.720]  They are now calling it in the U.K. the happy pass when you can't leave your house without
[02:26.720 --> 02:30.640]  a special QR code on your phone.
[02:30.640 --> 02:37.680]  They call it the freedom pass when you wear bracelets to track where you go in Israel.
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.720]  And so I got up at 2 a.m. and I've been up since 2 a.m. and I read this whole document.
[02:43.720 --> 02:49.400]  Now every facet of it is bone-shilling.
[02:49.400 --> 02:53.400]  But what's even more insane is it's actually being implemented all over the world right
[02:53.400 --> 02:58.360]  now and this is a U.N. program and it describes taking families away from each other, taking
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.800]  children away and putting you in forced labor.
[03:03.800 --> 03:07.680]  Now this is the Cloward and Piven strategy.
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.440]  It's how you bankrupt an economy, get enough people not to work until productivity collapses.
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.560]  You flood the country with third-world population and finally the social safety net gives out
[03:18.560 --> 03:20.960]  and the state fails.
[03:20.960 --> 03:28.960]  The police are laid off or fired, the university start closing.
[03:28.960 --> 03:29.960]  We're here.
[03:29.960 --> 03:36.840]  This is stalling out the engine of the country to collapse economically, create such panic
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.280]  that people then accept the new currency, the universal guaranteed income and then it
[03:42.280 --> 03:44.480]  just gets worse from there.
[03:44.480 --> 03:52.920]  And then the daily way of life is every neighborhood has a captain over it with armed leftists
[03:52.920 --> 03:54.640]  who are not from your neighborhood.
[03:54.640 --> 04:00.040]  They come and it says in the document they're going to then put, quote, disadvantage groups
[04:00.040 --> 04:07.160]  in your home and then if you, quote, cause any racial or cultural problems, you'll then
[04:07.160 --> 04:09.840]  be taken to a camp.
[04:09.840 --> 04:15.680]  So the entire United States is going to be a giant open-air reeducation camp and it says
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.240]  right here that they're going to quote, take people from diverse backgrounds and put them
[04:21.240 --> 04:27.520]  in your house and then it describes how the armed forces are going to be there in the
[04:27.520 --> 04:31.880]  neighborhood, camped out and then if you don't do what they're told, they're going to come
[04:31.880 --> 04:33.760]  take you away.
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.720]  So I want to explain something.
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.200]  On a scale of a one to 10, this is a 10 of evil, I mean, this is the most hardcore savage
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.320]  evil takeover ever.
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.520]  General Austin has about to purge the U.S. military of anyone that won't take the deadly
[04:47.520 --> 04:48.520]  shots.
[04:48.520 --> 04:49.520]  That's by design.
[04:49.520 --> 04:51.760]  They're going to start to fall slags and then they're coming.
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.160]  Obviously won't be on air anymore by the time that happens.
[04:54.160 --> 04:55.160]  Get ready, folks.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.160]  This is it.
[04:56.160 --> 05:00.640]  They're getting ready to take us down full war, emergency, emergency, emergency.
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.800]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for
[05:04.800 --> 05:08.760]  dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.440]  of thousands of Americans and with promo code alex with mypilla.com or frankspeech.com
[05:13.440 --> 05:16.000]  or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  It's an amazing deal.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.920]  You get my six pack of towels for $39.99, normally $199.
[05:20.920 --> 05:26.320]  You can get my Geese and Dream Sheets, normally $100 a set as low as $49.99 a set.
[05:26.320 --> 05:31.280]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.280]  going on.
[05:32.280 --> 05:34.520]  Myself, I need the cyber symposium.
[05:34.520 --> 05:37.920]  I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[05:37.920 --> 05:40.080]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[05:40.080 --> 05:42.040]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[05:42.040 --> 05:46.640]  Your best special is using the promo code alex and you're supporting us getting the word
[05:46.640 --> 05:53.760]  out with alex's great show and for worse, and you're supporting my pillow, 2,500 employees
[05:53.760 --> 05:57.280]  that I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attacked and camp.
[05:57.280 --> 05:58.280]  Beautiful.
[05:58.280 --> 05:59.280]  You're an example of resistance.
[05:59.280 --> 06:06.280]  Godspeed.
[06:06.280 --> 06:22.600]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:22.600 --> 06:32.640]  So this document is so horrible, is so evil, is so draconian, is so historically over the
[06:32.640 --> 06:42.560]  top, even in the Orwellian terms they use, that it is shaking me.
[06:42.560 --> 06:46.000]  When you read this document and you see they've already implemented most of it around the
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.200]  world and now it's coming here, you can see the abject hell that all of us are about to
[06:53.200 --> 07:05.160]  go under with millions of paramilitary leftists in your house running your life.
[07:05.160 --> 07:10.040]  No one has studied this at the level I have other than the enemy that's rolling it out.
[07:10.040 --> 07:13.960]  And so when I read this, I see all the components.
[07:13.960 --> 07:21.400]  What came out last year and said, we're going to have a module that's for communal homes.
[07:21.400 --> 07:25.360]  Even in a small apartment, you'll have to let other families in, and then that's going
[07:25.360 --> 07:29.800]  to be modeled and controlled by Facebook, and you're going to have local community managers
[07:29.800 --> 07:36.360]  that watch you over cameras and systems in your house to make sure you're complying.
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.480]  And that's down on the infrastructure bill that just passed minutes ago.
[07:40.480 --> 07:44.880]  They kept the provision in for bylaw, all cars that have cameras in it, and breathalyzers
[07:44.880 --> 07:46.720]  watching you in lifetime.
[07:46.720 --> 07:48.840]  But I'm digressing.
[07:48.840 --> 07:57.720]  Let me just describe this to you.
[07:57.720 --> 08:05.440]  This is so thought out, this is so complete, this is so scientific by these behavioral
[08:05.440 --> 08:12.480]  psychologists and these social engineers that only a total rejection of everything they
[08:12.480 --> 08:18.600]  say and everything they do on its face can stop it.
[08:18.600 --> 08:22.240]  Because they are undermining the economy, they are undermining the culture, they are
[08:22.240 --> 08:26.120]  paying people to stay home, we're now a year and a half into that, there are giant labor
[08:26.120 --> 08:33.200]  shortages that are causing a global breakdown and mass starvation in the third world.
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.880]  The UN then organizes those people and brings them here by the millions to be another group
[08:38.880 --> 08:45.440]  they have that will then again implode the economy and they're going to have the solution
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.560]  of a new socialist communist system and it's all described.
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.960]  People heard two weeks ago, the CDC said we order as its own branch of government, not
[08:57.960 --> 09:05.000]  legislative, not executive, not judicial, they just said we order everyone to get six
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.720]  months more of free rent, it's been going on for over a year.
[09:10.720 --> 09:13.040]  And everybody said well you don't have an authority sex totally, and they said yeah
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.560]  we do and you notice it's ongoing, it happened.
[09:16.560 --> 09:22.640]  That's because a national emergency has been declared by Biden and the CDC is the absorption
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.960]  arm because they know that you'll fight FEMA and you'd even fight the military coming
[09:26.960 --> 09:32.240]  to take your guns, but if it's all done to stop a virus and it's the CDC, well Operation
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.040]  Lockstep and the Rockefellers say, chances are you will succumb to it.
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.680]  So let me just calmly as best I can lay this out.
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.720]  My phone started ringing and I was getting calls at 2 a.m. last night because this document
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.240]  hadn't been on the internet in full even though it's a year old until just a week or so ago
[09:51.240 --> 09:58.240]  and folks were sending it to me, so I got up, I started reading it and I read the document
[09:58.240 --> 10:06.200]  five times and I printed off here hundreds of supporting documents to understand everything
[10:06.200 --> 10:10.800]  I tell you here, I have the document that backs it up where they've already prepared
[10:10.800 --> 10:11.960]  it.
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.520]  But let's start at the beginning.
[10:14.520 --> 10:25.520]  Here is Barack Obama 13 years ago, U.S. Senator running for president saying we want a domestic
[10:25.520 --> 10:34.520]  security force, a domestic security force, a DSF, just as big and just as strong as
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.440]  our military and you hear that and you go, well that's ridiculous, that's preposterous,
[10:39.440 --> 10:40.440]  how would he do that?
[10:40.440 --> 10:46.040]  And then he set up the groups that created the core organizations that for 13 years have
[10:46.040 --> 10:51.240]  been preparing this and now you will know them as the contact tracers and then they'll
[10:51.240 --> 10:57.880]  be backed up by the carbon tracers and that's really the next leg of this thing.
[10:57.880 --> 11:02.320]  Once they get you with that phone, the tracking trace everywhere you go and have to present
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.640]  the phone, even leave your house and have it scanned by the police and by the new civilian
[11:07.640 --> 11:12.640]  corps that are all these millions of millions of college students that can't get a job because
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.600]  the economy has been shut down and off-shored, their new job for 20 bucks an hour is going
[11:17.600 --> 11:25.920]  to be minding you and it describes in the new CDC battle plan that is the next CDC operation
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.520]  and you've heard all this from the UN, you've seen it in Australia, you've seen it in Spain,
[11:29.520 --> 11:37.120]  you see it now in the UK, you see it in France and they announced that by isn't it strange
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.840]  early next year this will be in place right before the midterms.
[11:42.840 --> 11:46.040]  As I told you, they're never going to let you have those midterms to be free and fair
[11:46.040 --> 11:48.560]  and so what you see in Australia, what you see in France, I'm going to show you the
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.800]  next segment, that's all coming here now.
[11:54.800 --> 12:01.160]  Trips on the streets, paramilitary police and then citizens ratting you out and getting
[12:01.160 --> 12:04.720]  in your face and Paul Watson has written an article about it and I called Paul at the
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.640]  time and he's shown us a good job Paul, I called him at 3 a.m. last night, he was already
[12:09.640 --> 12:17.600]  up, he's six, seven hours ahead and a CDC COVID document discussed relocating high-risk
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.240]  individuals to camps.
[12:20.240 --> 12:23.840]  That's interesting headline but it's way more hardcore than that.
[12:23.840 --> 12:31.920]  It's official CDC policy says millions of Americans who don't even have a disease are
[12:31.920 --> 12:40.320]  sick but because they're poor or because they are old they're going to be put in quote
[12:40.320 --> 12:49.360]  green zone camps and they'll have to quote work to earn their living in the camp and
[12:49.360 --> 12:52.640]  actually call them camps.
[12:52.640 --> 12:55.360]  So here's Obama 13 years ago.
[12:55.360 --> 13:02.680]  Continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[13:02.680 --> 13:03.680]  that we've set.
[13:03.680 --> 13:10.440]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[13:10.440 --> 13:13.120]  just as well funded.
[13:13.120 --> 13:22.720]  Now I'm begging you to simply go to infowars.com and to go read the first paragraph as a link
[13:22.720 --> 13:24.800]  to the document.
[13:24.800 --> 13:32.080]  The document is only about nine pages long but it's very fine print and I want you to
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.880]  read this for yourself and if it doesn't make the hair on the back of your neck standup
[13:36.880 --> 13:39.520]  nothing will.
[13:39.520 --> 13:42.280]  It describes breaking up families.
[13:42.280 --> 13:48.520]  It describes how they're going to coordinate off every neighborhood, every town and then
[13:48.520 --> 13:52.640]  we've got the federal training manuals where they're training the lockdown rural areas
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.520]  and how to permanently set up checkpoints, they're building huge quote residential centers
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.560]  all over Europe and all over the UK and now in the United States.
[14:02.560 --> 14:07.040]  They're also starting to set these up and when locals ask what are they for, the local
[14:07.040 --> 14:14.680]  paper says well it's for the new way of life battling COVID and it doesn't matter how many
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.680]  scientists come out and say it's the vaccine killing people like the viral video out of
[14:19.680 --> 14:25.240]  Indiana, the medical doctor, the COVID doctor who just devastated him in a six minute presentation
[14:25.240 --> 14:29.760]  we're going to play that at the bottom of the hour and of course they're trying to take
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.280]  his license now.
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.280]  They're on the news saying you question us, you'll lose your license.
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.800]  I mean this is a corporate world government takeover and they need an excuse for martial
[14:41.800 --> 14:51.240]  law, an excuse to lock down every town and every city and it describes all the sectors.
[14:51.240 --> 14:56.880]  It says you will have the household HH level but you will have local block captains that
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.760]  mind you and inspect your home and place other families with you and by the way when
[15:02.760 --> 15:07.440]  you go to the United Nations right now I never aired this report I should have I put it on
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.800]  man.video I went to the UN don't know why I didn't air it I just don't air all of my reports
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.040]  because I'm sick of looking at me but you go there and there's these big giant signs
[15:15.040 --> 15:22.640]  saying global reset, nanotech will take over your bodies, communes instead of cities and
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.960]  then it shows the communes and it looks like a concentration camp and it says your family
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.920]  will live in a dirt floor bunker and you will learn you will own nothing and have nothing
[15:32.920 --> 15:38.760]  and you're like well that's dystopic exactly it's the psychology where they where they
[15:38.760 --> 15:45.320]  just flip it on you and and and here's the thing again they're destroying the economy
[15:45.320 --> 15:49.400]  so it collapses so all these people are going to want to go to these places because they
[15:49.400 --> 15:53.920]  won't have any food or water or medicine and then it just normalizes all these giant open
[15:53.920 --> 16:03.920]  air prisons that's why they've normalized all the homelessness. This is so diabolical.
[16:03.920 --> 16:31.920]  Here's a man who can show you.
[16:31.920 --> 17:01.840]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year.
[17:01.840 --> 17:07.320]  We're seeing world government, world ideas being announced, forced inoculations. All
[17:07.320 --> 17:12.200]  the tyranny we warned of is now here but on the good side there is also a global awakening
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.600]  the lives of which this planet has never seen so truly the battle between good and evil
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.320]  is now front and center. That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners
[17:20.320 --> 17:23.800]  for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years because without

[18:46.520 --> 18:53.120]  can share it there it is red alert emergency broadcast CDC announces plan to put millions
[18:53.120 --> 18:57.520]  of Americans in forced labor camps I'll be reading the document here in a minute but
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.840]  just think about again two weeks ago they're like oh no one can be kicked out for not paying
[19:02.840 --> 19:08.280]  their rent for another six months people said we don't have an authority but notice it's
[19:08.280 --> 19:15.480]  still just ongoing because this is martial law this is civil emergency the CDC is the
[19:15.480 --> 19:23.480]  vehicle for total control forced inoculations digital passports everything we told you was
[19:23.480 --> 19:28.080]  coming in and people are like but this is authoritarian yeah once they finally make
[19:28.080 --> 19:34.240]  their move that everything collapses very quickly and cloud and piven did not invent
[19:34.240 --> 19:40.640]  this just like the Stockholm syndrome was not invented or didn't exist until researchers
[19:40.640 --> 19:46.080]  in the 60s saw examples of people that have been kidnapped and tortured by bank robbers
[19:46.080 --> 19:50.560]  who would then start identifying with their captors that's been going on since humans
[19:50.560 --> 19:57.480]  have been around but we call it Stockholm syndrome that's the name and it's the same
[19:57.480 --> 20:03.560]  thing for what's going on right now we can give all this new names but it's classic to
[20:03.560 --> 20:09.880]  say we can lock up whoever we want we can take away whoever we want there's no new process
[20:09.880 --> 20:18.680]  and cloud and piven was a husband and wife team of sociologist economists who were communists
[20:18.680 --> 20:24.320]  this is a public plan and it was endorsed by a democratic party by the 70s to bankrupt
[20:24.320 --> 20:30.680]  the social welfare net by bringing in so many foreigners having so many regulations on businesses
[20:30.680 --> 20:36.800]  paying people not to work until society fell apart and the capitalist system was destroyed
[20:36.800 --> 20:42.400]  and it's the ultra rich that are now doing this because they're offshore and tax exempt
[20:42.400 --> 20:48.800]  so this whole thing is the end game of a very serious deadly takeover where the ruling class
[20:48.800 --> 20:56.880]  wages economic war and cultural war on us and divides us and conquers us it's very very
[20:56.880 --> 21:02.160]  simple and it's happening now but when you look at the the largesse of the project and
[21:02.160 --> 21:10.880]  how huge it is and how they camouflage every part of what they do as a humanitarian action
[21:10.880 --> 21:18.200]  now internally they don't call it that let me let me show you a couple documents here
[21:18.200 --> 21:21.840]  here's the main article that hasn't linked in it so anybody can go get this and get stuff
[21:21.840 --> 21:27.520]  like this while you still can cdc covert document discussed relocating high-risk individuals
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.640]  to camps and and that's a nice headline by paul and i love paul but it's much worse
[21:32.640 --> 21:39.680]  than that cdc document lays out plan to relocate millions of people in forced labor camps
[21:39.680 --> 21:47.600]  because it says you're going to work in these camps of course it was all free to sit there
[21:47.600 --> 21:54.920]  and watch netflix before but now you're going to work here's the actual document interim
[21:54.920 --> 22:00.320]  operational considerations for implementing the shielding approach to prevent covered
[22:00.320 --> 22:08.520]  19 infections in humanitarian settings and it says if you're old or poor that means black
[22:08.520 --> 22:19.520]  you are going to be put in a green zone work camp but it's almost worse if you live in
[22:19.520 --> 22:33.040]  a house you will then take families into your house so they've got the home program household
[22:33.040 --> 22:43.160]  hh level then you've got operational considerations in the shielding document in each green zone
[22:43.160 --> 22:48.560]  has dedicated latrine bathrooms all of it it describes breaking up families taking you
[22:48.560 --> 22:53.520]  know who don't even have the covid health since they thrown all logic out the window
[22:53.520 --> 23:03.840]  why even say they have covid man this is so evil and it's what you already see in france
[23:03.840 --> 23:09.000]  in australia and everywhere else and the monitoring protocols and men and women individuals with
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.680]  tuberculosis and blah blah blah green zone should be more spacious in terms of shelter
[23:14.680 --> 23:20.800]  area per capita than surrounding camp sector even at the cost of greater crowding of low
[23:20.800 --> 23:26.320]  risk people oh so don't worry the high risk people that they're having to totally lock
[23:26.320 --> 23:31.360]  up they get a more spacious area in the camp I mean this this reads like Kurt Vonnegut
[23:31.360 --> 23:42.720]  satire possibly how to take children away from their parents and require additional care
[23:42.720 --> 23:50.960]  and who will take care of your children isn't that great and how to break the families up
[23:50.960 --> 23:58.360]  now let's look at it here is FM 3-39.40 we got this document the army leaked it to us
[23:58.360 --> 24:02.280]  one year after we got it people didn't believe it was real the army officially admitted it
[24:02.280 --> 24:09.600]  was real internment and resettlement operations this was launched under obama and it's had
[24:09.600 --> 24:13.440]  a round of americans and put them in camps the whole thing's declassified you can see
[24:13.440 --> 24:20.200]  here where it says destroy by any method that will prevent disclosure of contents or reconstruction
[24:20.200 --> 24:27.120]  of the document and I would send it when it was a secret document and we put it out and
[24:27.120 --> 24:36.640]  then a year later the military admitted it was real and here's the latest mark dice video
[24:36.640 --> 24:43.240]  shock video americans signed petition to arrest trump supporters who they say stole the election
[24:43.240 --> 24:47.080]  so they say yes arrest people for saying with them stole the election that's the majority
[24:47.080 --> 24:57.040]  of people he talked to in california so that's what this is and here's the cloured piven
[24:57.040 --> 25:03.000]  strategy if you want to understand that a political strategy outlined in 66 by american
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.400]  sociologists and political activists richard cloured and frances fox piven go read it the
[25:10.400 --> 25:17.040]  plan and the focus on democrats how to bankrupt society to take communist control so that
[25:17.040 --> 25:22.120]  society breaks down their main mission get rid of the single family home and get rid of
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.080]  male leadership but it'll be males running the camps they just don't want any men that
[25:26.080 --> 25:31.080]  could stand up or organize against them because my god this is what men are built for is to
[25:31.080 --> 25:41.760]  say no to something like this now let me show you just going out to break what's happening
[25:41.760 --> 25:47.720]  let's do when we come back in australia and in france because exactly what you see there
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.520]  will now be here by next year started being made attested in blue city controlled sectors
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.600]  and they're putting pressure on their own politicians and minions to carry all this
[25:58.600 --> 26:03.400]  out or they'll be removed for all the dirt they've got on each one of them and that's
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.880]  breaking andrew quomo resigns following sexual harassment allegations after new york governor
[26:08.880 --> 26:19.720]  faced mounting pressure to quit and he's not in trouble for killing 20,000 old people
[26:19.720 --> 26:25.440]  sending sick patients into nursing homes under the un's directive no no no it's for hitting
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.200]  on women which I'm not saying it's a good thing for a married governor to do but on
[26:29.200 --> 26:35.800]  a scale of 1 to 10 it's about a 2 and killing old people knowingly is about a 12 so there
[26:35.800 --> 26:42.120]  you go ladies and gentlemen all I can tell you is here's the big news this is all been
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.120]  theoretical and tested out by the you and other countries about the chai comms and others
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.720]  but but now they're going operational in the west with actually setting up camps everywhere
[26:50.720 --> 26:59.880]  and taking all our guns and killing us so just get ready for that there's one central
[26:59.880 --> 27:07.620]  fact of criminal psychology the criminologist all agree on that its criminals are extremely
[27:07.620 --> 27:12.640]  pathological even more the general public they do the same things over and over again
[27:12.640 --> 27:19.120]  and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again well guess what
[27:19.120 --> 27:27.160]  it was Anthony Fauci a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.320]  of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were
[27:31.320 --> 27:36.760]  the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lymphocytes
[27:36.760 --> 27:42.240]  in the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would
[27:42.240 --> 27:47.480]  then break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.880]  the covid-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the covid-19 vaccine destroys your
[27:51.880 --> 27:56.640]  immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV that's right ladies and gentlemen

[29:21.080 --> 29:25.040]  and we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we
[29:25.040 --> 29:30.160]  ask God for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting
[29:30.160 --> 29:35.440]  prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential at the same time supporting

[30:38.560 --> 30:48.480]  to be on air during this incredible time you see this takeover is all about stealth and
[30:48.480 --> 30:51.440]  labeling tyranny and labeling work camps and labeling national IDs and passports to leave
[30:51.440 --> 30:57.360]  your house internal checkpoints as as medical but but all of that is a lie all of that is
[30:57.360 --> 31:05.640]  a fraud all of this is operation lockstep the Rockefeller un plan for total world government
[31:05.640 --> 31:13.920]  and now we've seen phase two in australia in europe in canada endless lock downs checkpoints
[31:13.920 --> 31:20.680]  small businesses non essential big companies essential consolidating the economy and military
[31:20.680 --> 31:27.160]  and police again not letting you drive or walk down the street any more than three kilometers
[31:27.160 --> 31:33.040]  from your house or you are arrested and the police coming in demanding again to scan your
[31:33.040 --> 31:38.120]  phone with your identity who you are to have a cup of coffee while the borders of europe
[31:38.120 --> 31:45.280]  and the united states are wide open it's it's it's the cover for martial law we were throwing
[31:45.280 --> 31:48.920]  the globalist out all over the world we were voting them out we were saying no to the carbon
[31:48.920 --> 31:54.560]  taxes no to all their lies and so what do they do they launched a worldwide scare and
[31:54.560 --> 32:00.240]  are bringing in martial law and they're tightening down the vice they're they're tightening down
[32:00.240 --> 32:05.240]  the noose around our necks right now and everything we've seen the unannounced everything
[32:05.240 --> 32:10.800]  we've seen the un push europe's a year ahead of us is now being set up for next year here
[32:10.800 --> 32:18.960]  in the u.s. being phased in this fall and winter as we speak as we speak the end of
[32:18.960 --> 32:25.040]  the republic as we know it without a shot being fired but boy then once they get the
[32:25.040 --> 32:30.880]  collapsed economy in and the universal basic income you'll be able to buy anything with
[32:30.880 --> 32:36.880]  the money but you'll be totally behold of the system and then all these people will
[32:36.880 --> 32:44.960]  be organized into giant camps work camps that's how communists do it they shut off the regular
[32:44.960 --> 32:52.880]  economy in russia in china in russia in 1917 took them 10 years to get control of russia
[32:52.880 --> 32:59.080]  took them five years to get control of china 1949 and they killed tens of millions of people
[32:59.080 --> 33:06.560]  in each country just doing that so this is a very dangerous playbook and again they want
[33:06.560 --> 33:09.820]  you to sign everything over you've gotten phase one so what they do is they take you
[33:09.820 --> 33:15.080]  in as a dissident or as a covid patient or as a troublemaker and they have your family
[33:15.080 --> 33:18.840]  held and then they make you sign everything you've got over to them and then they'll tell
[33:18.840 --> 33:23.840]  you we want you to work for us now we'll even give you a position in the party and if you
[33:23.840 --> 33:28.920]  do it then they figure out all your secrets they get your expertise your control and then
[33:28.920 --> 33:32.920]  a few years later you're found to not be doing a good job in the party you're then sent for
[33:32.920 --> 33:42.920]  five years forced labor and or to be killed so you know us today is like oh there are
[33:42.920 --> 33:47.440]  quarantine camps being set up but you know they're still stretching the claim they're
[33:47.440 --> 33:54.840]  not scary they're not a problem and all over new york they have signs at the u n everywhere
[33:54.840 --> 33:58.840]  else saying soon you will live in communes soon you will own nothing soon you will have
[33:58.840 --> 34:05.840]  nothing you will live in communist communes and then fast forward it shows shots of the
[34:05.840 --> 34:17.600]  communes you're going to live in dirt floor bunkers so there's really not words to describe
[34:17.600 --> 34:24.400]  this you're like oh the pentagon will save us how the pentagon is going to run it that's
[34:24.400 --> 34:27.640]  why they're saying oh there's white supremacist in the military well what's the white supremacist
[34:27.640 --> 34:32.040]  somebody that questions the election or likes trump or likes guns or doesn't want forced
[34:32.040 --> 34:37.640]  machinations that's in the terrorism national directive from june from the public president
[34:37.640 --> 34:43.600]  and then you've seen the secretary of defense wearing a face shield and a black hood over
[34:43.600 --> 34:49.520]  his head like he's darth vader and they've announced anyone not taking the experimental
[34:49.520 --> 34:56.720]  shot will be court marshaled well they tried that in 1991 they tried that in 2000 they had
[34:56.720 --> 35:01.880]  to stop because it came out that it was illegal to give somebody an experimental anthrax shot
[35:01.880 --> 35:07.280]  even under federal law so they're tricking people if you verbally tell your commanders
[35:07.280 --> 35:13.080]  no they can court marshal you but there are processes we have some lawyers on about it
[35:13.080 --> 35:18.280]  where you file a letter up the chain of command and explain it's experimental and why then
[35:18.280 --> 35:23.360]  they'll move on to some person that's not very high IQ that refuses the shot but smart enough
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.480]  to refuse it who won't know how to defend themselves to make them an example so again
[35:27.480 --> 35:32.360]  all of this is color of law all of this is nurenberg code violations and i want to get
[35:32.360 --> 35:43.800]  dr francis boil on as soon as possible maybe a commercial free saturday emergency report
[35:43.800 --> 35:50.760]  the things are all moving very very fast right now and i don't have words described to you
[35:50.760 --> 35:57.160]  how much danger you're in if we want to fix this we have to do what senator ran paul did
[35:57.160 --> 36:02.400]  yesterday in that short speech he gave that i'll play at the start of the next hour where
[36:02.400 --> 36:08.840]  he explained to everyone that this is tyranny this is a power grab it has nothing to do
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.720]  with science and that fouching and Pelosi are basically criminals and that we must stop
[36:13.720 --> 36:19.560]  complying with all this that's all true but if people don't get that it's a scientific
[36:19.560 --> 36:26.880]  takeover plan there's no way to stop it i mean you have to come to grips with the fact
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.880]  that milley literally is a new world order operative and trump was a chump even putting
[36:31.880 --> 36:38.440]  him in power but he was the next guy in chain of command that austin is a monster that on
[36:38.440 --> 36:44.360]  array is a monster and that they've been tapped publicly because of their gun confiscation
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.240]  and anti-american views and then now they're going to purge the military with dishonorable
[36:49.240 --> 36:56.520]  discharges for anybody that doesn't take these experimental deadly shots so it's done as
[36:56.520 --> 37:03.600]  a litmus test and i'm going to break all that down for you coming up here today as well
[37:03.600 --> 37:11.240]  but this this is an assault on notice first disband the police defund the police and really

[37:50.840 --> 37:56.960]  taxes are the same way where grandma lived on one end and then mama and daddy lived
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.360]  on one end and then uh you know the kids lived on the other you'd have three generations
[38:02.360 --> 38:10.640]  living in a house good times well they say that's a bad thing in this official cdc document
[38:10.640 --> 38:14.000]  and they said they're gonna come in and they're gonna take your old folks just like you don't
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.280]  go see your old people now they tell you oh no sorry can't go the nursing home a year

[39:04.320 --> 39:10.560]  mainstream media's mouth at this point i mean folks this is the combined power of major
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.880]  foundations the communist chinese the eu the america hating islamists the america hating
[39:15.880 --> 39:22.960]  hollywood group all of them in one combined effort to bring this country down and if you
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.520]  look at france and the uk and germany australia you'll notice there's police but with them
[39:27.520 --> 39:34.640]  are like teenagers in little weird uniforms that's the youth brigades everything you think
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.360]  about in the tyranny they've done it it's like overloaded i mean imagine tyranny comes
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.840]  america's be the biggest thing anybody ever saw like our defense budgets half the world's
[39:43.840 --> 39:49.000]  defense budget of all the other countries so imagine what's going to be like i mean it's
[39:49.000 --> 39:57.440]  going to be every leftist green-haired nut turned loose on you my god help us it is through
[39:57.440 --> 40:03.520]  our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.640]  the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[40:08.640 --> 40:14.520]  water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal
[40:14.520 --> 40:19.760]  gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.640]  millennia the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the
[40:24.640 --> 40:30.840]  pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is
[40:30.840 --> 40:37.200]  what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[40:37.200 --> 40:43.200]  fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration

[44:00.840 --> 44:22.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:22.840 --> 44:38.840]  all right erin of babbitt ashley babbitt's very articulate husband is going to be joining us in the third hour today and i've already covered a lot of this number one news story that that is the story of the fact that we're being incrementally put into martial law
[44:38.840 --> 44:56.840]  under martial law regular laws have been suspended the cdc is being given dictatorial power via fema and president biden to do whatever they want and the insane document but you notice the crew just search engines things i say and so i'm talking about
[44:56.840 --> 45:18.840]  democrats want a civilian security force just as big and just as strong as the military i said that at the start of the show and i said phase two of the civilian military force that obama was pushing in 2008 is going to be
[45:18.840 --> 45:32.840]  government police that go around and check your phone to make sure you're calibrating it and scanning every purchase and everything you do to pay carbon taxes i know that this posh wab said so but oh let's just say posh wab doesn't run things well
[45:32.840 --> 45:50.840]  the crew just found an article from a couple months ago i didn't even know about aoc democrats want to create civilian core to battle climate change a 1.5 million strong group of americans to join a civil climate core
[45:50.840 --> 46:08.840]  you're going to have a multi million person climate core you're going to have a multi million person bigger than the u.s. military covid core and then you're going to have the new national police known as the capital police that go around looking for
[46:08.840 --> 46:22.840]  democrats and targeting people and the democratic party suing everyone and then collapsing the economy and and making you under emergency edex take people in your home you go i won't put up with that
[46:22.840 --> 46:40.840]  but once you're in a depression you will because they'll say we're going to forgive your mortgage for now you just got to house people and again then they can politically control what you do and it's it's all in this plan so if you want to destroy america you got to destroy the culture the economy and people's independence
[46:40.840 --> 47:00.840]  and my god in these documents that describes how to take over farms and ranches and when i sat there and read what happened in venezuela and tuba and north korea and china and russia and eastern europe places like poland hungry romania ladies and gentlemen this is happening here now
[47:00.840 --> 47:11.840]  and it tears my guts out i mean this is a communist playbook with big tech sensors and phones as your high tech papers
[47:11.840 --> 47:26.840]  and then it's not just like the soviets are going to take over you can still have a wife and children or husband and children they're not going to let you have families and they're going to take your children away for gender reassignment they say in the cdc documents
[47:26.840 --> 47:35.840]  we're going to have to fight but every time we fight they're going to blow up a truck bomb in a school or something and say we did it and blame it on us
[47:35.840 --> 47:44.840]  every time we resist having our kids taken they'll just commit a crime and said we did it that's how they control the mainstream media so they can commit atrocities and say we did it
[47:44.840 --> 47:59.840]  so the only really good chance we've got of avoiding a lot of this is for people like senator paul and senator cruise and everybody else to do with tucker carlson's done and realize that we're telling the truth here and get hardcore and rally people against this
[47:59.840 --> 48:07.840]  and to absolutely stop the election fraud they're going to try to pull next year and more
[48:07.840 --> 48:20.840]  and really get serious about these people and start having our own civil disobedience and not minding one damn thing they say I mean if they get us on the leash if they get the ball and chain on us if they get us in those handcuffs
[48:20.840 --> 48:29.840]  and tie up our legs and feet they got us and that's what a digital domestic passport is they're going to build the carbon tax climate core on
[48:29.840 --> 48:49.840]  and then it's katie bar the door I mean this is going to be horrible and if you resist your racist and if you resist the climate core people that come to your house one will be white one will be black one will be Hispanic
[48:49.840 --> 48:59.840]  you'll be put on the news that well this man was shot and killed he didn't let the climate force on his farm and he didn't take refugees so they had to take the racist out
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.840]  he could be black he could be white they're going to kill you and they're trying to kill you
[49:05.840 --> 49:12.840]  and I know a lot of big gun stores here in Austin the owners have told me they said don't say our name but it's the three or four I've talked to
[49:12.840 --> 49:22.840]  when the left comes into these gun stores these shooting ranges people say what are you getting guns for and they say we're getting ready to take out the Trump people
[49:22.840 --> 49:30.840]  and so and I've got all the UN clips saying we're coming in your house and we're going to take your kids out well that's the UN talking and they've done that all over the world
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.840]  now it's in a CDC document here in America
[49:35.840 --> 49:44.840]  all right so I'm behind I'm not behind I've been saying a lot of important things but I need to play clips of what it's going to look like here from Australia from England from
[49:44.840 --> 49:53.840]  France and I need to play this doctor who's done the best job yet in just six and a half minutes at an Indiana
[49:53.840 --> 49:57.840]  Mount Vernon City Council
[49:57.840 --> 50:08.840]  and it's going to be doctors like this speaking up that are going to turn the tide as well and it's going to be it's going to be farmers and ranchers and machine shop owners and police officers and just pastors
[50:08.840 --> 50:14.840]  but I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen you better get going now
[50:14.840 --> 50:26.840]  what we saw from Rand Paul is the spirit of what we need this is an attack this is a fraud these are criminals reject them but he's got to go further that they've captured the military leadership
[50:26.840 --> 50:38.840]  they're now purging the military they're now purging the police they're doing everything you do in a takeover and they're admittedly doing a takeover and they're paying people not to work to permanently shut down the economy
[50:38.840 --> 50:49.840]  so that people don't have a choice but to submit to this because they don't know any better that's how the communists get control they shut the damn food off
[50:49.840 --> 51:04.840]  again every bit of my energy because I'm not a coward but I love my children and my family and I don't like putting them in harm's way and every bit of my energy is holding myself here still on air and not selling every damn thing I got and just disappearing
[51:04.840 --> 51:22.840]  of course I know they're going to hunt me down particularly so there's no point the best place for my family is at the front line top of the mountain fighting them trusted in all of you but my flesh my spirit's willing my flesh is Jones you need to get down
[51:22.840 --> 51:36.840]  because this is bad this is guaranteed they're making their move you can guarantee we're not going to be on the air next year we don't stop us now you can guarantee they're going to start coming to your house you can guarantee they're coming for your guns
[51:36.840 --> 51:47.840]  you can guarantee they're going to give your neighbors credits on their debit card if they lie about you and turn you in you can guarantee in two years a lot of you are going to be enforced labor camps or dead
[51:47.840 --> 52:02.840]  I mean this is the real deal like you hear banging on the door at 2am and you get up and some big guy just broke through your door with a gun you're not happy it happened but he's there what are you going to do
[52:02.840 --> 52:18.840]  you're going to get on the ground in a fetal position and hope he doesn't tie you and your wife up and rape you and kill you or are you going to just wish you had a gun at the ready huh maybe you did have a gun maybe you got a baseball bat the point is just better to be prepared now
[52:18.840 --> 52:32.840]  because I got footage of police viciously beating men women and children all over the world while their borders are wide open and these police will take you to a FEMA camp in 10 seconds these are followers these are soulless people in blue cities
[52:32.840 --> 52:50.840]  so the police can be good if they're constitutional but the minute the left runs them they are cancer so you're not going to be able to count on them I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and lay all this out and I'm not trying to be doomed and gloom for everybody I just get to understand this is a real takeover it's happened
[52:50.840 --> 53:08.840]  oh we have some very very very very very exciting news and by the way as negative as I've been I meant to start the whole show off there's a way to stop this but you have to you have to know what that is you have to know how much trouble you're in before there's any
[53:08.840 --> 53:24.840]  shot to turn this around the whole point in beating it is to admit that it's bad you understand like Owen was in Missouri for a week visiting family plates golf with folks is that and he said they still think this is America they don't know it's a globalist
[53:24.840 --> 53:40.840]  they don't know we're in the middle of full swing takeover they don't know that we're in the middle of a damn war so I intend to be on air in a year and I intend to hold these people off they may swallow up the rest of the world but I believe America and certain states in our system we're going to be able to stop these people but it's going to be an incredible fight
[53:40.840 --> 53:52.840]  politically and energetically and it's going to take banner hangs and protest and nonviolent civil disobedience and it's going to take money speaking of that it's been sold out for months thank God the supply chain finally worked for a minute
[53:52.840 --> 54:01.840]  we got a limited amount of the doctor Jones natural activated charcoal mouthwash with all the essential oils such a great clean quality mouthwash gets back in stock

[55:17.840 --> 55:34.840]  myself I need this for the cyber symposium I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox you know what I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture we're going to bring the word out on our own your best specials use the promo code Alex and you're supporting us getting the word out with Alex is great showing
[55:34.840 --> 55:50.840]  him for worse and you're supporting my pillow 2500 employees and I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack beautiful you're an example of resistance Mike Lindell Godspeed Gerald and South Carolina go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker hey Alex
[55:50.840 --> 56:05.840]  welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away
[56:05.840 --> 56:20.840]  living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew 24
[56:20.840 --> 56:36.840]  first night then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[56:36.840 --> 56:48.840]  right where we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[56:48.840 --> 56:58.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[56:58.840 --> 57:12.840]  if you want to understand how communists are funded by the ultra rich just study history and communists when they take over a country they go and sit over all the means of production
[57:12.840 --> 57:20.840]  to totally control the society and bring them under their will that's now being prepared and set up here with this global climate emergency
[57:20.840 --> 57:32.840]  they can move groups of leftists around the country give them three quote green housing to then take control of any district they want this is very sophisticated this is a military attack
[57:32.840 --> 57:46.840]  and this bombshell CDC document has been put out describing how they're going to force relocate even healthy people into forced labor camps yes that's the information but here's a little boil down of exactly what we're facing
[57:46.840 --> 57:50.840]  we'll be back in the next segment to lay it all out here today
[57:50.840 --> 58:04.840]  hey did you know 95% of the hospitalizations in Israel are people vaccinated hey did you know 99.9% of the people hospitalized in Australia are injected it's not a gel to variant that's that's what they were injected with
[58:04.840 --> 58:24.840]  141 people are in hospital with COVID at present and 43 are in intensive care 18 of whom require ventilation so this is a very serious disease of those 141 60 are under the age of 55 and 28 under the age of 35
[58:24.840 --> 58:43.840]  all the one a vaccinated one person has a just received one dose of vaccine but there comes a time when you're dealing with a public health crisis that could involve you your family and everyone else that's something supersedes that need to do exactly what you want to do
[58:43.840 --> 59:03.840]  permanent martial law is being established the chains are going on lock down to is being incrementally activated but this information now in front of us is 100% documented completely clear and is very paradoxical
[59:03.840 --> 59:19.840]  because it is actually the national health services that are reporting the data and then it's completely being ignored by the media and they continue to move forward with it and one of my talking about it's just dumb founding
[59:19.840 --> 59:35.840]  remember Israel three weeks ago said we're getting new breakthrough cases and people that are vaccinated and they said yeah the majority of people that are really sick have had the inoculation and then other countries reported the same thing all over the world same numbers
[59:35.840 --> 59:51.840]  now remember what it's actually say three weeks ago 100% or 99% of the people sick are dying didn't have the shot and you just heard that lie and Congress said where's the numbers on that you don't get them
[59:51.840 --> 1:00:06.840]  put your mask back on take your shot like Chucky I got my shot I got my shot for you this is this is this is FDA approved him and talk he says like no it's not yeah it is take it
[1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:15.840]  according to Dr. Fauci the nearly 10,000 COVID related deaths in the United States last month more than 99% were from unvaccinated people
[1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:35.840]  we're going to see and I've said almost two types of America you know those regions of America which are highly vaccinated and we have a low level of dynamics of infection and in some places some states some cities some areas with a level of vaccination is low and the level of virus dissemination is high
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:53.840]  that's where you're going to see the spikes oh you're very sick now let me go back to my laboratory where we tortured dogs to death or babies haha oh came out yesterday we keep babies alive Fauci does while he gets his the organs is is is is is
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:01:11.840]  if Dr. Anthony Fauci thought Rand Paul was mad at him wait until the animal activists see this a new report shows that under Fauci's direction the National Institute of allergies and infectious disease funded painful and deadly experiments on dogs to the tune of more than $400,000
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:26.840]  according to the white coat waste project researchers used biting flies to infect dozens of healthy beagles with parasites to test an experimental drug records show the dogs endured months of pain and once researchers were done with them they were killed
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:48.840]  that more for you is is ah I love my laboratories when we torture beagles to death though haha but we sit here and go oh oh it's it's the delta variant oh yes so then the delta variant only attacks those that are inoculated right no it's the vaccine doing it
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:56.840]  that's not even two plus two equals four ladies and gentlemen a lobotomized three-year-old could understand that
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:23.840]  you've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans and with promo code alex with mypilla.com or frankspeech.com or any of your sites they get the very best discount it's an amazing deal
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:36.840]  I like everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on myself I need this for the cyber symposium I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox you know what I'm not going to succumb to your
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:53.840]  culture we're going to bring the word out on our own your best specials use the promo code alex and you're supporting us getting the word out with alex is great showing him for worse and you're supporting mypilla 2,500 employees that I haven't had to lay anyone off in spite of trying to be an
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:03:21.840]  example you're an example of resistance Mike Lindell Godspeed we've got it waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war we are now into our number two
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:41.840]  thank you so much for joining us today we've known what's unfolded across the world we've seen martial law declared under UN auspices we've seen treatments for regular viral infection suppressed jack up death tolls we've been locked away not able to see our elderly families and nursing homes on a planetary scale seeing record
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:54.840]  levels of them killed via lack of care we've seen our borders wide open during all this now we see the so-called vaccines killing massive numbers of people and then they tell those that have taken it sorry it doesn't protect you you still lose your rights as well
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:15.840]  so always give up your rights you'll get freedom back oh sorry give up more rights you'll get your freedom back when that's an oxymoron those that will give up liberty or security deserve and will get neither as Benjamin Franklin said and so I spent most of the first hour on this report
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:26.840]  CDC COVID document discusses relocating high risk individuals to camps and that's an important headline from Paul but it doesn't even go there
[1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:39.840]  it's not strong enough Paul's hosting the fourth hour day he'll do a splendid job it says it's an official battle plan and it talks about taking healthy people and putting them in forced labor camps
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:58.840]  and then giving the at risk homeless and others nicer areas in the camp and how those are allowed to keep their homes will have to have environmental core people along with COVID individuals the COVID core in your house
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:14.840]  bringing other families in that live with you I mean the same stuff you saw with open borders in Europe and bringing in the tens of millions of Muslims and kicking people out of their hotels and putting the Muslims in and telling the hotels you got to pay for it
[1:05:14.840 --> 1:05:31.840]  this is economic war using migrants using economic shutdown using the fear of the virus and now the Pentagon says we're going to start in September 15th little more than a month out
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:47.840]  forcibly inoculating with an experimental shot the US military despite the fact that there's laws against it and they've been reprimanded had to stop it in 2000 and in 1990 1991 with the anthrax shots
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:06:04.840]  Pentagon pulls trigger will order all troops to get COVID vaccines by September 15th under threat of court martial and they want to trick you if you do it verbally and refuse that order to that person you can be court martial
[1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:21.840]  but if you do it up to the chain of command with written letters it's got to be done properly then you will be in a key case to overturn this next attempt at biological rape with this dangerous shot which again they admit doesn't protect you and lowers your immune system
[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:37.840]  this is all to ski experiment 2.0 but on a mass scale and I'm going to talk more about that coming up in a few minutes here's an article out of the military times troops were refused anthrax shot paid a high price really do they get to keep their lives though
[1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:52.840]  the narrow decision court holds dishonorably discharged veterans may be denied gun and bullet ownership see that's the plan is dishonorably discharge you we're going to be laying all that out but first
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:07:07.840]  because now I didn't even know this I said first hour I said the plan will then be on top of this COVID core there will be several million people that come to your house and control your life and then literally set up checkpoints all over the highways the roads cordon off every neighborhood every town
[1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:26.840]  everywhere will be cordon off with these new federal individuals who are just social workers with guns so they're not going to get rid of the police they're going to shift them over to be the force of these guys and in this document it just describes it all it's so hellish
[1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:40.840]  so what you see happening over in Australia is what they're now beta testing to bring here and it's now coming here and it's all going to be for the mid term elections and they're going to turn on black lives matter and anti for rioting again and anybody that protest against more
[1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:59.840]  violence anti was going to come shoot you and attack you they're the brown shirt foot soldiers so that the the the the communist models being used by mega banks and they're going to make a serious run at this country and they describe how they're going to put the environmental
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:15.840]  core and how they're going to put the climate core and the COVID core in your houses and that's what they do they just move in set up tents and then the military is at your house like well that'll never happen while I met a whole film called police state for
[1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:30.840]  after Katrina showing general honore locked down two states confiscate guns in five cities moving to people's houses and now they've announced they're announcing the new civilian core the battle climate change and they are going to be moved
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:50.840]  under the stimulus package that just passed today. Billions of dollars per city millions per small town to move COVID and environmental cores into your town.
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:09:01.840]  Who will then spy on you watch you have control the police have control the feds and then they'll have the voting block and the machines to make sure they then take your town over.
[1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:15.840]  So now you think they've just taken the blue cities they've just taken the blue states now they're expanding with their invasion forces and all the major universities are suing the police and suing publishers and suing radio broadcasters.
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:30.840]  I mean I have Georgetown with elements of the CIA connected groups literally suing me in Virginia and their goal is to quote bankrupt us and shut us down.
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:35.840]  All because we sent reporters and covered.
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:54.840]  That whole thing in Virginia and they lie about us the lawsuit and say we said things we didn't even say they don't care. So it's all the institutions with all the bank or money waging war the ruling class the big banks Hollywood the EU the Fortune 100 big tech just.
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:10:09.840]  You're going to take shots military experimental you're going to move people in your house we're going to open the borders up we're going to do it all so let me show you what's coming at least in Australia they speak out against it imagine you pull into a small town to get groceries and aggressive police run up.
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:25.840]  I want to scan your phone to make sure you're not more than three miles away from your house you're going to be arrested.
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:47.840]  Here it is.
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:56.840]  In the constable be woods.
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:01.840]  Stop by the police you're ready listener for not wearing a mask in his car.
[1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  You're good when you pulled over.
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:18.840]  Was I detained.
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:22.840]  I was entertaining you know I drive off because I wasn't detained.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:27.840]  So now you're telling me so now you need to show me your medical exam.
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:35.840]  Thank you for not wearing a mask cops at their own game.
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:38.840]  This is medical tyranny you're a dirty human.
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:44.840]  You can't drive in your car through the checkpoint without your mask cover your face dirt bag.
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.840]  I don't see your filthy piehole.
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:52.840]  Welcome to the police state.
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:58.840]  I think you're playing games I think you're wasting police resources you're wasting police resources.
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:00.840]  You're inciting.
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:01.840]  There you go.
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:02.840]  That's how you win.
[1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:05.840]  That's how you win ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:12.840]  We come back I'll show you the footage out of France where the police are walking over and like poking people.
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:20.840]  I mean just third world slimy North Korea slimy and they hold up their little phones and they scan them so they can drink coffee on an outdoor cafe.
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:24.840]  Oh but member it was never coming it was never going to happen it was in all the battle plans.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.840]  It was all there I told you a year ago now it's here now they're going to do it here this year and next year.
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:31.840]  Everything it's all an official plan.
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:35.840]  It's not in a COVID document discussing it.
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:37.840]  It's a battle plan.
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:44.840]  And we're just going to sit here and watch these terrorists do this by declaring us terrorists because of what's in our bodies saying we're all dirty and bad.
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:49.840]  When most these leftist are pedophiles and they can't wait to get your children.
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:51.840]  They talk about they're going to take your children from you.
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:53.840]  They're going to be yours now.

[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:24.840]  It will remind you every day like it does me and my family and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:30.840]  Not because you've done something wrong but because the big telecoms big tech and the globalist are predatory and are evil.
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:36.840]  And in the surveillance state we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:39.840]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:44.840]  They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors and they are only $19.95.
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:48.840]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.840]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war.
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:55.840]  Please take action today, protect your privacy and fund the info war.
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:59.840]  So what's the most important part let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:05.840]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front it's all very important but the fuel is paramount.
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:07.840]  And that's my allegor.
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:14.840]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:18.840]  that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:21.840]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours.
[1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:26.840]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:32.840]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:35.840]  It's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:38.840]  Turbo force, without you, we don't roll.
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:40.840]  With you, we search forward together.
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:42.840]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:45.840]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:48.840]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:50.840]  It's a win-win, 360 together.
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:16:07.840]  Infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:22.840]  All right, let's jump straight into it because I've got a lot of clips and a lot of news to get to ahead of Ashley Babbitt's very articulate, informative, and it's very sad to hear him speak.
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:30.840]  Husband, I saw him on with one of the guest hosts Sunday night after I did my show 4-6.
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:42.840]  They had a guest host on and she had him on and I sat in my office watching it for 30 minutes and actually got a tear in my eye because just the humanity of this guy and what they did to her and then how they demonized her.
[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:47.840]  And now Shapiro basically said she deserved to die.
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:49.840]  It's just so disgusting.
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:53.840]  So that's coming up in a 30-minute interview in the next hour.
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:57.840]  Then I'll continue with news after that.
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:03.840]  I have a tendency to get down on the weeds and show you all the proof instead of just make the big announcements and statements.
[1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:11.840]  But let me try to quantify something here before I get to these next clips.
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:18.840]  The strength of what the globalist is doing is that it's so over the top, so evil, that people can't believe what's happening.
[1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:32.840]  And it also operates covertly while also being out in the open in that they name everything different from what they're actually doing.
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:41.840]  But what they're doing will create poverty and enslavement and really sabotage of society where it doesn't work.
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:43.840]  And that's being done to create a post-industrial world.
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:50.840]  So if this looks destructive and destroying property and destroying wealth, it's designed to.
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.840]  And that's what Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and them talk about.
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:55.840]  So this is what's happening.
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:17:57.840]  100% there's no debating it.
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:00.840]  And in their intellectual circles, that's what they're doing.
[1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:04.840]  They've made the decision to play the part of the destructor in nature.
[1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:09.840]  They claim to create a survival of the fittest paradigm to save the earth.
[1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:15.840]  When they themselves are extremely degenerate and very satanic and extremely predatory.
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:23.840]  But they've self-appointed themselves guardians of the earth when really they're the ones destroying it.
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:29.840]  And so you look at the public and you see how dumb down they are.
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:33.840]  And you see them buying into some of this or you see them too lazy to stand up.
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:35.840]  And you got to understand they're in a trance.
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:38.840]  They've been raised to be followers from birth.
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:39.840]  They're not leaders.
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:47.840]  It's up to those of us that are aware and have a connection to God and understand what's really going on to be leaders.
[1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:51.840]  And I saw that in the video yesterday by Senator Paul.
[1:18:51.840 --> 1:19:00.840]  It's 50% of where we need to go compared to other people that are going 10% of where we need to go.
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:07.840]  And if he just calls out Klaus Schwab and says this is all a power grab and a criminal agenda just like he called out the Wuhan lab.
[1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:14.840]  It's true and it will devastate the enemy.
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:17.840]  It's that simple.
[1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:21.840]  And people have to understand just from a laziness factor.
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:31.840]  If they successfully implode the economy and turn us into a third world war zone which is already happening all over the planet.
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:36.840]  Our lives are going to be living hells very, very soon.
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.840]  And so this is about survival.
[1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:44.840]  You can intellectually debate are there too many people and this or that.
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:49.840]  But for 99% of us, 99.9%.
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:52.840]  It's not the 1% has 80% of the wealth.
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:58.840]  It's 1 tenth of 1 tenth of a percent that has like 70%.
[1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:02.840]  Tell me you got $200,000 a year that you're paid.
[1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:03.840]  You're in the 1%.
[1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:05.840]  That's not who runs things.
[1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:14.840]  It's the globalists that control trillions and they are at war with us and they admit they're at war with us.
[1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:26.840]  And they're totally insulated on their private Fiji islands and their Hawaiian islands and in Tasmanian Island and in all these places.
[1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:33.840]  While they do this to us and now they've locked all those islands down they control and they're going to try to sit it out.
[1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:39.840]  While they collapse us and basically kill us.
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:44.840]  And I guess the argument is well what are all these extra people doing?
[1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:50.840]  Go ahead and let them have a shot that doesn't protect them and grows prions in them so they'll slowly die.
[1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:57.840]  And then the hospitals owned by the globalists will suck all the money out of them while they die.
[1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:03.840]  But to see the magnitude of this premeditated evil is just stunning.
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:13.840]  And to show the UN running around.
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:18.840]  Showing fires and showing earthquakes and showing locusts and saying it's the end of the world.
[1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:19.840]  Give us full power.
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:23.840]  Let the robots take over.
[1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:31.840]  And people need to have solidarity and realize that and come together and realize it's the globalists that dump all their toxic waste in the third world.
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:33.840]  It's the globalists that suppress the third world.
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:35.840]  You know let's roll that video with audio.
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:36.840]  You guys are just rolling in a moment.
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:49.840]  The people at the French cafes outside trying to drink espresso and the military and the police and then another video shows just bureaucrat minders come over and start scanning their phones.
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:54.840]  And the police take their phone without gloves.
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:56.840]  The dirtiest thing somebody's got is their phone.
[1:21:56.840 --> 1:21:59.840]  Something like 99% of them have feces on them.
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:00.840]  The most bacteria.
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:02.840]  It's as dirty as somebody's mouth.
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:05.840]  You might as well just be kissing somebody's ass or their mouth.
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.840]  You might as well just bend that woman over and stick your face right up there.
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:09.840]  I'm serious.
[1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:11.840]  But it's all theater.
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:12.840]  It's all crap.
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:16.840]  Here's the cop grabbing the phone to scan it and see if she's allowed to be out.
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:19.840]  And she subserviently looks up like I'm good.
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:21.840]  I took my shots.
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:23.840]  And now they're like that's not good enough.
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:24.840]  More shots.
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:25.840]  More.
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:30.840]  Most of the people in the hospital now in Israel, almost everyone that took the booster is now sick with COVID.
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:31.840]  It's not COVID.
[1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:32.840]  It's the shot.
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:36.840]  How many shots will you take each time you get sicker when the literature shows that?
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:45.840]  But it's all an exercise in absurdity because people won't admit under mass Stockholm syndrome that they're under attack.
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:47.840]  So here's the French video.
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:49.840]  There's a bunch of it.
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:50.840]  Bud Brawlett.
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:53.840]  I think it's for your health, if you'll please.
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:54.840]  There you go.
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:56.840]  With no identity.
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:16.840]  And this isn't going to be about you get to travel.
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:21.840]  Now they're going to tell you for carbon reasons you're not authorized to travel unless your phone says so.
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:23.840]  And they admit that's where this is all designed to do.
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:27.840]  It's now been announced.
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:33.840]  I was saying soon, the first hour, they will announce that you've got to have this for your carbon rate ratio.
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:36.840]  And then I didn't know it already been announced.
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:40.840]  When the crew found articles.
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:48.840]  So remember, the borders are open on Europe, they're being totally flooded, no go zones everywhere, just like here in the U.S.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:55.840]  But there are the French compliant showing this to be able to go to a restaurant.
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:56.840]  Didn't think it would happen.
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:57.840]  It's here.
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:03.840]  And then once that gets put in place, then they have new shutdowns say your business is not essential.
[1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:05.840]  It goes bankrupt, but it's okay.
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:12.840]  They're going to give you money, but there won't be as many people growing crops or fixing cars.
[1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:14.840]  I know all these people that own like RVs.
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:15.840]  Nobody can fix them.
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:16.840]  Nobody comes to work.
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:17.840]  Nobody can get their jet ski fixed.
[1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:18.840]  Nobody can get their tractor fixed.
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:20.840]  Nobody can get a plumber out of their house.
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:21.840]  Somebody get their house roofed.
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:23.840]  It's the breakdown by design.
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:34.840]  And then once the resources plunge, oh, we're forming the environmental work co-ops where you're going to go work in work brigades.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:35.840]  Or you're a lovely young lady.
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:42.840]  You can come up to the local commandant's office and you can serve us drinks at the officer's club.
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:49.840]  And then the only person in your family raising money will be your daughter, who will be a prostitute now for the military.
[1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:51.840]  Yep, that's how it works.
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:02.840]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:19.840]  and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:24.840]  Orson slaves are just just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:32.840]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:37.840]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia.
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:42.840]  And we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:43.840]  It's that choice.
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:46.840]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:50.840]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:54.840]  It is a spiritual battle and Info Wars is the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:24.840]  It is considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:30.840]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:35.840]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:43.840]  The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava-kava, but other herbs including but not limited to
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:47.840]  German chamomile, organic skullcap and balearion root.
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:54.840]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:21.840]  It's normally a hundred and some dollars a set as low as forty nine ninety nine a set.
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:26.840]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:29.840]  Myself, I need the cyber symposium.
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:32.840]  I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:34.840]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:36.840]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:41.840]  Your best special is using the promo code Alex and you're supporting us getting the word out.
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:48.840]  With Alex's great show, InfoWars, and you're supporting my pillow, twenty five hundred employees.
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:51.840]  And I haven't had to lay anyone off in spite of trying to be an attack in camp.
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:53.840]  Beautiful, you're an example of resistance.
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:55.840]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:15.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:20.840]  Alright, so it's an endless lockdown.
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:21.840]  It's world government.
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:24.840]  It's world IDs.
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:28.840]  It will be the basis of a global carbon tax that tracks human lifetime.
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:32.840]  It taxes everywhere you go, everything you do.
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:38.840]  And that only allows you to travel or move when it says you are allowed to.
[1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:44.840]  So they're skipping right ahead to the technocracy, right ahead to the end game of the whole program.
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:48.840]  And there has been a very powerful video that's called Viral.
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:50.840]  I got sent this probably thirty times yesterday.
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  I meant to get to it, didn't get to it.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:57.840]  I want to air it now here on the Alex Jones show from Mount Vernon School Board meeting.
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:05.840]  Dr. Dan Stock of McCordsville, Indiana recently appeared at the Mount Vernon School Board meeting.
[1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:15.840]  It's a medical doctor to educate members of the school board on the science behind COVID-19 vaccines and mask.
[1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:17.840]  And this video needs to go viral.
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:22.840]  It's posted at mfullwars.com and bandotvideo, but here it is.
[1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:27.840]  Dr. Dan Stock, 5777 West Semina North, McCordsville, Indiana.
[1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:31.840]  To address your comment, it's hard to believe we're eighteen months into this and still having a problem.
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:35.840]  And I would suggest the reason we still have a problem is because we're doing things that are not useful.
[1:29:35.840 --> 1:29:39.840]  And we're getting our sources of information from the Anna State Board of Health and the CDC,
[1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.840]  who actually don't bother to read science before they do this.
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:44.840]  I'm actually a functional family medicine physician.
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:48.840]  That means I am specially trained in immunology and inflammation regulation.
[1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:53.840]  And everything being recommended by the CDC and the State Board of Health is actually contrary to all the rules of science.
[1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:57.840]  So things you should know about coronavirus and all other respiratory viruses.
[1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:00.840]  They are spread by aerosol particles, which are small enough to go through every mask.
[1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:04.840]  By the way, the literature that supports all of that is in a flash drive that we've presented to you.
[1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:06.840]  It's been given to the secretary.
[1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:12.840]  As a matter of fact, it quotes at least three studies sponsored by the NIH to that exact fact,
[1:30:12.840 --> 1:30:18.840]  even though the CDC and the NIH have chosen to ignore the very science that they've paid to have done.
[1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:22.840]  That is why you keep struggling with this is because you cannot make these viruses go away.
[1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:27.840]  The natural history of all respiratory viruses is that they circulate all year long,
[1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:30.840]  waiting for the immune system to get sick through the winter,
[1:30:30.840 --> 1:30:36.840]  or become deranged, as has happened recently with these vaccines, and then they cause symptomatic disease.
[1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:39.840]  Because they cannot be filtered out and they have animal reservoirs.
[1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:43.840]  And this is a very important point. No one can make this virus go away.
[1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:47.840]  The CDC has managed to convince everybody that we can handle this like we did smallpox,
[1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:49.840]  where we could make a virus go away.
[1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:51.840]  Smallpox had no animal reservoirs.
[1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:53.840]  The only thing it learned to infect was humans.
[1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:55.840]  That's why we were able to make that virus go away.
[1:30:55.840 --> 1:31:00.840]  That will not happen with this any more than it will with influenza, the common cold respiratory syncytial virus.
[1:31:00.840 --> 1:31:05.840]  Add no viral respiratory syndromes or anything else that has animal reservoirs.
[1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:11.840]  So the reason you can't do this is because you're trying to do something which has already been tried and can't be done.
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:15.840]  Equally important is that vaccination changes none of this, especially with this vaccine.
[1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:21.840]  And I would hope this board would start asking itself, before it considers taking the advice of the CDC, the NIH,
[1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:28.840]  and the State Board of Health, why we are doing things about this that we didn't do for the common cold influenza or respiratory syncytial virus.
[1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:33.840]  And then ask yourself, why is a vaccine that is supposedly so effective,
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:38.840]  having a breakout in the middle of the summer when respiratory viral syndromes don't do that?
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:43.840]  And to help you understand that, you need to know the condition that is called antibody-mediated viral enhancement.
[1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:50.840]  That is a condition done when vaccines work wrong, as they did in every coronavirus study done in animals,
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:56.840]  on coronaviruses after the SARS outbreak and done in respiratory syncytial virus,
[1:31:56.840 --> 1:32:01.840]  where a vaccine used in a vulnerable individual, done the wrong way,
[1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:06.840]  which cannot be done right for a respiratory virus which has a very low pathogenicity rate,
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:13.840]  causes the immune system to actually fight the virus wrong and let the virus become worse than it would with native infection.
[1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:16.840]  And that is why you are seeing an outbreak right now.
[1:32:16.840 --> 1:32:20.840]  In fact, in that flash drive you're going to have coming to you and in the e-mails with six extra,
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:30.840]  I'll be a study showing that 75% of people who had COVID-19 positive symptom cases in Barnstable, Massachusetts outbreak were fully vaccinated.
[1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:38.840]  Therefore, there is no reason for treating any person vaccinated any differently than any person unvaccinated.
[1:32:38.840 --> 1:32:46.840]  You should also know that no vaccine, even the ones I support and would give to myself and my children, ever stops infection.
[1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:50.840]  In 2014, there was outbreak of mumps in the National Hockey League.
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:54.840]  The only people who came down the symptoms were the people who were unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status.
[1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:56.840]  Boy, that sounds like a great argument for vaccines.
[1:32:56.840 --> 1:33:01.840]  But a question that you should ask yourself, knowing that half of the people who came down with symptomatic disease
[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:09.840]  had no contact with an unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status individual, where did they get the disease?
[1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:13.840]  And the answer was from the vaccinated individuals.
[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:15.840]  No vaccine prevents you from getting infection.
[1:33:15.840 --> 1:33:18.840]  You get infected, you shed pathogen.
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:21.840]  This is especially true of viral respiratory pathogens.
[1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:23.840]  You just don't get symptomatic from it.
[1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:30.840]  So you cannot stop spread. You cannot make these numbers that you've planned on get better by doing any of the things you're doing.
[1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:33.840]  Because that is the nature of viral respiratory pathogens.
[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.840]  And you can't prevent it with a vaccine because they don't do the very thing you're wanting them to do.
[1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:43.840]  And you will be chasing this through the remainder of your life until you recognize that the Center for Disease Control
[1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:47.840]  and the Indian State Board of Health are giving you very bad scientific guidance.
[1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:53.840]  And instead, read the articles that are going to come in the e-mail and are on this flash drive and listen to the people in this audience here tonight
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:58.840]  who actually have recognized the advice they are getting from the CDC and the NIH is counterfactual.
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:03.840]  And that's why you're still fighting this with this vaccine that supposedly was going to make all of this go away.
[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:09.840]  But it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of COVID-19 develop in the middle of the summer when vitamin D levels are at their highest.
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:15.840]  By the way, the other thing that would necessarily be any vaccine restriction to be considered is if there were no other treatment available.
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:21.840]  And I can tell you having treated over 15 COVID-19 patients that between active loading with vitamin D, ivermectin, and zinc
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:25.840]  that there is not a single person who has come anywhere near the hospital.
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:31.840]  And we already have studies that show that if you achieve a 25-hydroxy vitamin D level greater than 55, your risk of COVID-19 death
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:37.840]  will drop down to one quarter of the population average for the United States.
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:41.840]  And there are active treatment trials included on that flash drive that show the same as true.
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:48.840]  So if you were going to discriminate based upon vaccine, you should also discriminate based upon 25-hydroxy vitamin D level, zinc taste test response,
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:55.840]  and probably previous infections since there are also studies on that flash drive that show that people who have recovered from COVID-19 infection
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:35:01.840]  actually get no benefit from vaccination at all, no reduction in symptoms, no reduction in hospitalization,
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:07.840]  and suffer two to four times the rate of side effects if they are subsequently vaccinated.
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.840]  Therefore, the policies that you are basing on are totally counterfactual.
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.840]  I don't blame this board for that because I know you aren't scientists and you thought it was reasonable to listen to the CDC, NIH,
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:18.840]  and the Indiana State Board of Health.
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:23.840]  But I would encourage that instead you listen to the people out here in this audience and read what's on that data drive.
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:29.840]  And if anybody here in this board has any questions about anything on that, I will happily come back and sit with you individually
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:31.840]  if you would like to explain the science behind this.
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:37.840]  And if you're worried about being sued by somebody because you don't follow the guidance of the CDC and the NIH,
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:41.840]  I will tell you have a free pro bono expert testimony at your disposal.
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:47.840]  I will testify in defense of this board, turning down all these recommendations for free at any time in any court.
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:48.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:49.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:50.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:54.840]  Well, out of all the incredible doctors and scientists and nurses I've heard and they've all been amazing,
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:36:00.840]  that guy is the most concise in six and a half minutes video as much watch upon infowars.com.
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:03.840]  So I hope you go to infowars.com and find the article.
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:04.840]  It's about halfway down the page.
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:05.840]  We just put it back on screen for me.
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:06.840]  Thanks.
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:08.840]  And please get it and share it.
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:16.840]  Dr. Educate School Board on COVID vaccines and mass slams, CDC, NIH.
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:17.840]  Did you hear what he said?
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:19.840]  He kept saying it.
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:27.840]  This is accepted known science that if you gave people this type of vaccine, it would cause a bunch of mutants.
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:31.840]  And now the hospitals are seeing a lot of people.
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:33.840]  They're not all full, but some are.
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:35.840]  It's much worse than last year.
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:39.840]  And it's people that have been vaccinated, mainly they're at the hospital and those numbers are out.
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:46.840]  95% in Israel, 99.9% in Australia, 97% in Gibraltar, on and on and on.
[1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:50.840]  And if you're a radio listener, you hear me talking about this.
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:52.840]  TV viewers, see all this.
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.840]  Here's Associated Press this year, April.
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:01.840]  More polio cases now caused by vaccine than by wild virus.
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:03.840]  The vaccinated are spreading it.
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:05.840]  That's a fact.
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:07.840]  That's what the doctor's telling them.
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:14.840]  And they sit there and, of course, follow the orders of the health department because they don't want liability.
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:20.840]  We need to start suing these people so they understand liability.
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:22.840]  But this is a broken social contract.
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:27.840]  The globalist cooked this up to give us a problem like I told you a year and a half ago that will never be fixed
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:35.840]  with fake tests and never ending problems and autoimmune responses to our own proteins in our bodies and spike protein spreading.
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:39.840]  I mean, this is so premeditated.
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:42.840]  It's a perfect thing to take down civilization.
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:45.840]  All right, we're going to come back with even more news on that.
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:50.840]  And I've got a lot of other news we haven't gotten to yet on other subjects, but everything is this COVID takeover.
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:53.840]  Worldwide Marshall Law via the U.N.
[1:38:20.840 --> 1:38:22.840]  We're in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:24.840]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air.

[1:38:58.840 --> 1:38:59.840]  Granny Do Right.
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:00.840]  Granny Do Right.
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:01.840]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:02.840]  Go ahead.
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:04.840]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:11.840]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:15.840]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.840]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:28.840]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:32.840]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:35.840]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:41.840]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:42.840]  This is working.
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:43.840]  This is wonderful.
[1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:47.840]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:52.840]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:58.840]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:02.840]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity,
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:08.840]  with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:12.840]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the republic doesn't get to see.
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:20.840]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:24.840]  people are really, really awakening the establishment.
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:27.840]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared.
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:29.840]  They're looking for leadership.
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:31.840]  Well, that's where info comes in.
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:32.840]  You fund us.
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:33.840]  You support m4store.com.
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:35.840]  You get great privacy at the same time.
[1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:39.840]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular,
[1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:45.840]  what the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:46.840]  That's our job.
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:53.840]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire so we can be the shock groups in the information war.
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:41:03.840]  Fund us at m4store.com.
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:27.840]  I just lost the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:29.840]  Myself, I need the cyber symposium.
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:33.840]  I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:35.840]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.840]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:43.840]  Your best special is using the promo code Alex and you're supporting us getting the word out with Alex.
[1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:47.840]  It's great showing him for worse and you're supporting my pillow.
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:52.840]  2,500 employees that I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack.
[1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.840]  Beautiful. You're an example of resistance.
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:57.840]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:26.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:43.840]  By the way, I'm going to be going to Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:48.840]  I'll be there tomorrow and I'll be there on Thursday and Friday after it's over.
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:52.840]  I can say Mike Lindell has done a great job.
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:59.840]  We posted a feed to his event at infowars.com.
[1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:05.840]  We're team players and it's got 200,000 viewers just on the rumble feed.
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:07.840]  There's a bunch of other feeds I took a look at earlier today.
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:11.840]  It looks like they got about a million people tuned in to that right now.
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:14.840]  You want to find that and share that most importantly.
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:17.840]  We've got links to it up at infowars.com.
[1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:25.840]  Again, the big voting machine companies are definitely Sioux Lindell, Fox, OAN, everybody else.
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:29.840]  Anybody that questions anything, they want to intimidate everybody.
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:37.840]  That's why now it's more important than ever for you to support what Mike Lindell is doing and infowars
[1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:43.840]  by going to mypellow.com with promo code Alex and getting the very best deals they've got.
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:47.840]  It's Mike Lindell that supports us. We're both men in the arena.
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.840]  Our crews are women and men in the arena and our families.
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:55.840]  We are the tip of the spear so I really appreciate your support.
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.840]  I think we really deserve your support and I think it's a smart move for you to support us.
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:02.840]  I know you've been doing it.
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:06.840]  If you need sheets or you need towels or you need pillows or you need a new bed.
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:09.840]  He's got some great beds for adults or dogs or cats.
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:16.840]  Or if you want the slippers and the shoes, he's got a lot of great Made in America products
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:20.840]  up to 66% off with promo code Alex.
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:24.840]  But yes, amazing symposium, really high quality production.
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:28.840]  They got hit with so many people when they first opened.
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:33.840]  They thought they were hacked, but that was just I think massive bandwidth hitting them.
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:37.840]  That's a good problem to have.
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:40.840]  Hey, and our rumble feeds got 40,000 people on it.
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:44.840]  And of course, there's hundreds of thousands watching on the band on video feed,
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:47.840]  but I just love getting our feeds out.
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:52.840]  And by the way, everybody is welcome to grab our streams and restream them however you want, wherever you want.
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:56.840]  We are free to air.
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:01.840]  And so many times the way we get around the sensors is you just simply taking the feed and reposting it
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:06.840]  or cutting it up or doing whatever the hell you want with it.
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:10.840]  I just want to reach people during this critical time.
[1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:13.840]  Separately, we have some other good news.
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:20.840]  We've been unable to get our really popular toothpaste in for over six months because supply chain break-downs.
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:26.840]  Also, we had Leticia James, the same lady trying to indict Trump, claim that we had COVID cures
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:32.840]  and that we were saying we had COVID cures for our tooth whitening toothpaste when we did not ever make that claim.
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:38.840]  But they threatened me and said, we're going to indict you if you don't stop selling it.
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:41.840]  And she kept saying, he keeps saying he's got a cure.
[1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:44.840]  I'm going to indict him if he doesn't stop selling it.
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:46.840]  And I just said, I'm going to pick my battles here.
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:48.840]  This is criminal in my view.
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:51.840]  This is a woman that sent people to die in nursing homes.
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:57.840]  And so we're not going to sell that toothpaste because she's lying about us when we do.
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:02.840]  But we already had developed the charcoal toothpaste that's very, very popular.
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:04.840]  Really cleans your teeth in a safe, great way.
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:06.840]  We have that back in stock with the mouthwash.
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:08.840]  It's been sold out for six months.
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:13.840]  You can get the mouthwash and the toothpaste together for 25% off.
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:16.840]  Or you can get the toothpaste by itself for $9.95.
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:18.840]  And we're really, really proud of the toothpaste.
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:25.840]  It's got 95% reviews, 4.7 stars at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:31.840]  I tell you, we are coming back out with the tooth whitening toothpaste that was so incredibly popular.
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:37.840]  Simply removing the little bit of ionic silver that was in it.
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:42.840]  And that should be in a month or so for folks that really loved that formula.
[1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:45.840]  They'll probably still indict me saying you can't sell toothpaste.
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:49.840]  I mean, at a certain point, you got to gauge what's going on.
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:54.840]  But this is a country where they arrest people for saying you should take vitamin C.
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:56.840]  It's essential. You die without vitamin C.
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:47:00.840]  But they've arrested doctors in Michigan that told their patients to take vitamin C.
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:05.840]  That's how evil, and more than evil, just dumb the government is.
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.840]  Just how dumb the government is.
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:16.840]  And just how stupid they think knowledge is like magic and made up or something.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:21.840]  Because I know they had to drop all the charges on those doctors and people they had arrested for vitamin C.
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:25.840]  Because it turned out vitamin C is really good for your immune system.
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:27.840]  I mean, you know, intravenous vitamin C.
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:29.840]  Tell people to take vitamin C to boost your immune system.
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:31.840]  Swat teaming them.
[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:35.840]  Because it's not the deadly shots that don't protect you from Fauci.
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:39.840]  See, they want full control to put this poison in you or you can't travel.
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:43.840]  You can't live your life. You can't do anything.
[1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:47.840]  And it just shows how far we've gone.
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:51.840]  We're very, very excited. The toothpaste is back in stock.
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:54.840]  And we also have the liquid turmeric formula.
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:48:00.840]  It's a very strong turmeric concentrate that is wonderful for everything that goes on your body,
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:03.840]  especially inflammation, immune system.
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:06.840]  Our pure turmeric formula has been sold out for months and months.
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:13.840]  It's back in stock 50% off, so I don't want to forget to cover that.
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:25.840]  So Joe Rogan came out last week just to dovetail with what that doctor in Indiana was saying in front of that school board.
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:36.840]  He came out and said, look at this study showing that the coronavirus is shedding from people that have been vaccinated at higher rates,
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:39.840]  which was a real study that just came out.
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:44.840]  Well, I decided and the crew decided to pull some articles to back up what Joe said.
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:47.840]  And I just mentioned one of these last segment, but here it is.
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:56.840]  More polio cases now caused by vaccine than by wild virus.
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:00.840]  And it just goes through it. The Associated Press, that that's the main cause of polio now is the vaccine.
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:04.840]  Here's the UN's own document.
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:13.840]  Vaccine delivered polio virus outbreaks from the UN's own report saying the majority of them are caused by vaccines.
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:18.840]  Let me show you some more. Here's the Lancet SARS-CoV-2 evolution and vaccines.
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:30.840]  Case for concern goes on to say, yes, most of the new COVID SARS cases they were seeing in previous viruses was from the vaccinated studies.
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:40.840]  And it's not like they didn't know this bombshell Nobel Prize winner reveals COVID vaccines is creating variants.
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:45.840]  Vaccinated people with breakthrough infections can spread the Delta variant CDC says.
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:48.840]  So, you know, there it all is.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:53.840]  And that's all we're trying to do is get the truth out.
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:50:00.840]  But the system wants to be able to create a new dark age where they kill logic and where we're here.
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:06.840]  I mean, the thousands of medical doctors that I know of have been taken off YouTube, Twitter, Facebook.
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  Now it's in the news they're threatening them and saying, if you give your patients vaccine waivers and a doctor's note saying,
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:24.840]  my patient has an autoimmune disorder, my patient has an allergic response, has had one, that you're not allowed to issue that.
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:25.840]  These people must take it.
[1:50:25.840 --> 1:50:35.840]  A woman is admittedly paralyzed for several years, still has some motor control problems in her feet and hands from Guion Beret.
[1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:39.840]  And she was going to the University of Hawaii and had her waiver.
[1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:44.840]  They kicked her out and said, sweetheart, we don't care if you got paralyzed from a previous shot.
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:47.840]  We don't care if your doctor says you can't ever take another one.
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:49.840]  You're going to do it.
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:55.840]  There was a woman who worked here a few years ago, a nice lady, who was going to go to Vietnam.
[1:50:55.840 --> 1:50:58.840]  And they told her, you got to take these shots.
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:50:59.840]  Almost killed her.
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:02.840]  She had an autoimmune response, had to wear a mask for months.
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:06.840]  And they told her, you can never take any inoculation again.
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.840]  It will kill you probably.
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:11.840]  Just like you get bee stings, you can't be stung by a bee again.
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:18.840]  But in this, they just say, we don't care, walk the plank.
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:20.840]  Yeah, university accepts the denies admission.
[1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:26.840]  The student previously paralyzed by vaccine after she files for vaccine medical exemption.
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:30.840]  And they said, yeah, the law says you can do that, but we don't care.
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:31.840]  We're moral.
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:33.840]  It's like a new virtue signal.
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:40.840]  Like not only if somebody calls you a Nazi, are we going to not give you, you know, your chance to go to school, not even take your money.
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:44.840]  But if you don't take a shot, you're like a mass murderer.
[1:51:44.840 --> 1:51:45.840]  You're like a drunk driver.
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:47.840]  You're a bad person.
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:57.840]  And now judges, you know, they're your doctor now is ordering in Houston, a man to get COVID vaccine as a condition of his probation, also in leftist run Houston.
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:01.840]  In a divorce court, the judge just last month ordered the mother and father getting divorced.
[1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:10.840]  Of course, I will take the child, the three year old, and I will put the child in foster care unless they take COVID.
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:19.840]  It's not even an approved vaccine for adults and not approved in experimental use on children, but the judge doesn't care.
[1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:22.840]  You give that child a COVID shot or I'm taking him.
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:25.840]  I'm a virtue signaling judge.
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:28.840]  It's just people have lost connection to reality.
[1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:32.840]  People have lost their moring, they've lost their morals, their soul.
[1:52:32.840 --> 1:52:34.840]  And most people are really dumb.
[1:52:34.840 --> 1:52:35.840]  I don't have street smarts.
[1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:37.840]  And the dumbest ones are the lawyers and judges.
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:40.840]  I mean, most of them are dumber than a box of rocks.
[1:52:40.840 --> 1:53:09.840]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:18.840]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[1:54:18.840 --> 1:54:27.840]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes of the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:37.840]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road. That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine.
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:48.840]  Because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:54.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:59.840]  If there is proof of vaccination and everybody is fully vaccinated, then you can take off your mask.
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:15.840]  It's time for us to reinstate some of these masking mandates while in the meantime ideally aiming for proof of vaccination so that we can really boost our vaccination number.
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:28.840]  I do believe at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates. The hesitancy at the local level of doing mandates is because the vaccines have not been officially fully approved.
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:34.840]  And I think when you do see the official approval, Jake, you're going to see a lot more mandates.
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:41.840]  And we know that this is what's going to turn the tide. And we also know that people are going to get a really clear message.
[1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:47.840]  If you want to participate in our society fully, you got to get vaccinated. You got to get vaccinated. It's time.
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:57.840]  And this is a shift from the Pentagon. They previously indicated that they would wait for FDA approval, but now Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin expected to move forward with this,
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  making the recommendation to the president that would require all of the 1.3 million active duty service members to be vaccinated.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:16.840]  Private businesses, I am asking them and suggesting to them, go to vaccine only.
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.840]  Vaccine only.
[1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:23.840]  I believe it's in your best business interest.
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:35.840]  First, following up on that rule in New York now where the mayor says if you're not vaccinated, you can't go to an indoor restaurant, a gym or a show. Does the White House think that that is fair to people who may have a religious reason for not wanting the vaccine
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:39.840]  or who might just be waiting for the FDA to approve it fully before they get it?
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:51.840]  The administration and the White House and the president support steps by localities to take steps to protect people in their states and their communities to incentivize people getting vaccinated.
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:55.840]  I don't know all the specific details if they had exemptions, so I'd point you to them.
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:09.840]  Are you concerned that the CDC has not tried to dispel the disease?
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:25.840]  We have a pandemic because the unvaccinated, and there's only a number of countries, the more we learn about this virus, the more they have to be worried and concerned.
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:33.840]  And the only one thing we know for sure, if those other hundred million people got vaccinated, would be a very different world.
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:43.840]  If you get vaccinated, you haven't, you're not nearly as smart as I said.
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:45.840]  Look at this beautiful city of Ayrfield.
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:57.840]  Multicultural hub of Sydney is crawling with military now.
[1:57:57.840 --> 1:58:09.840]  Sydney Constable B Woods.
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:11.840]  Got me?
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:13.840]  All good?
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:15.840]  No, yeah, mate.
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:19.840]  I thought when you pulled over, I wouldn't ask if you pulled your mask off.
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:21.840]  I said I needed to.
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:25.840]  But then you didn't speak to us any further and you drove off, mate.
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:27.840]  Exemption, please?
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:29.840]  Was I detained?
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:31.840]  Well, I drove off because I wasn't detained.
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:33.840]  I was asking if you're medical exemption.
[1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:35.840]  So now you're detaining me.
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:37.840]  So now you need to show me your medical exemption, okay?
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:39.840]  Knock yourself out.
[1:58:39.840 --> 1:58:41.840]  Thank you.
[1:58:41.840 --> 1:58:43.840]  They say you beat the cops at their own game.
[1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:45.840]  Oh, it does.
[1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:53.840]  Look at these cops.
[1:58:53.840 --> 1:59:01.840]  Welcome to the police state.
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:03.840]  I think you're playing games.
[1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:05.840]  I think you're wasting police resources.
[1:59:05.840 --> 1:59:07.840]  You're wasting police resources.
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:09.840]  Mate, you're inciting.
[1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:11.840]  There you go. That's how you win.
[1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:13.840]  That's how you win, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:17.840]  In France, anyone entering a venue with more than 50 people inside
[1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:19.840]  will need to present this health pass.
[1:59:19.840 --> 1:59:21.840]  And what it is, is either proof of full vaccination,
[1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:23.840]  a negative COVID-19 test result,
[1:59:23.840 --> 1:59:25.840]  or proof that you have recently recovered from infection.
[1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:27.840]  The sort of places you need to use it from today
[1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:29.840]  include museums, theaters, cinemas, Disneyland Paris,
[1:59:29.840 --> 1:59:31.840]  for example.
[1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:33.840]  But lawmakers in France are today debating about
[1:59:33.840 --> 1:59:35.840]  whether to extend this measure
[1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:37.840]  to other areas or all aspects of social life in France.
[1:59:37.840 --> 1:59:39.840]  So from next month,
[1:59:39.840 --> 1:59:41.840]  it could be possible, or it is quite likely,
[1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:43.840]  that if you head to a cafe or restaurant in Paris
[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:45.840]  or a restaurant in Paris,
[1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:47.840]  you'll be able to get a full vaccination.
[1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:49.840]  So you'll be able to get a full vaccination.
[1:59:49.840 --> 1:59:51.840]  A cafe or restaurant in Paris,
[1:59:51.840 --> 2:00:20.840]  and you'll be able to get a full vaccination.
[2:00:21.840 --> 2:00:23.840]  I just took everything and just passed the savings on
[2:00:23.840 --> 2:00:25.840]  because we need support right now
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:27.840]  for what's going on.
[2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:29.840]  Myself, I need the cyber symposium.
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:31.840]  I just lost a million-dollar-week revenue by telling Fox,
[2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:33.840]  you know what, I'm not going to succumb
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:35.840]  to your cancel culture.
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:37.840]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:39.840]  Your best special is using the promo code Alex,
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:41.840]  and you're supporting us getting the word out.
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:43.840]  With Alex's great show,
[2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:45.840]  ImpalMorris, and you're supporting
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:47.840]  my pillow of 2,500 employees
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:49.840]  that I haven't had to lay anybody off
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:51.840]  in spite of trying to be an attack in camp.
[2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:53.840]  Beautiful, you're an example of resistance.
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:55.840]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:01:13.840]  Music
[2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:17.840]  We are now in 2.
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:19.840]  Hour number three on this Tuesday,
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:21.840]  August 10th broadcast,
[2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:23.840]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:25.840]  Some of the wild stuff breaking
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:27.840]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo
[2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:29.840]  resigned to disgrace
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:31.840]  all of the sexual harassment allegations,
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:33.840]  and I think that's a good thing,
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:35.840]  but why aren't they going
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:37.840]  after Joe Biden or Bill Clinton
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:39.840]  who are clearly way worse than he is,
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:41.840]  and why aren't they getting in trouble
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:43.840]  for sending COVID-infected,
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:45.840]  really flu and pneumonia-infected patients
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:47.840]  into those nursing homes,
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:49.840]  and we now know suppressing the numbers,
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:51.840]  20,000 dead.
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:53.840]  He did that with Leticia James,
[2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:55.840]  the George Soros appointed
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:01:57.840]  Attorney General there.
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:01:59.840]  He installed her, she was elected.
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:01.840]  So you got that news,
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:03.840]  and then this news on infowars.com,
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:05.840]  UN to consider spring
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:07.840]  sulfate aerosols, chemtrails
[2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:09.840]  above the Earth's surface to reduce global temperatures.
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:11.840]  Oh, the UN's going to run our healthcare
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:13.840]  and tell us how to live our lives
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:15.840]  and so much more
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:17.840]  as they try to scare us.
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:19.840]  And now this huge piece of news
[2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:21.840]  that Dub tells with our special guest,
[2:02:23.840 --> 2:02:25.840]  National Strategy
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:27.840]  for Countering Domestic Terrorism
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:29.840]  June 2021.
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:33.840]  And it says if you question the elections
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:35.840]  or question
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:37.840]  open borders or question
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:41.840]  COVID lockdowns, you are a
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:43.840]  quote white supremacist,
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:45.840]  and as he says, if you are
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:47.840]  then a white supremacist,
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:49.840]  you are then a terrorist and the Pentagon
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:51.840]  should be used against you
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:53.840]  as a domestic terror threat.
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:55.840]  And they've said that
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:57.840]  Ashley Babbitt, a veteran,
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:02:59.840]  a patriot,
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:01.840]  who did nothing violent
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:03.840]  that day on January 6th,
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:05.840]  well, they say that
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:07.840]  some people said that everyone was horrible
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:09.840]  and everybody deserved to be shot.
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:11.840]  And she deserved what happened to her.
[2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:13.840]  We've got her husband here
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:15.840]  who I've seen in a lot of interviews,
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:17.840]  very impressive, smart fellow, a veteran himself,
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:19.840]  met her on deployments
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:21.840]  overseas.
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:23.840]  And I guess he met her doing
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:25.840]  security nuclear power plant. Let me get that right.
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:27.840]  I was watching him the other night.
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:29.840]  And so Aaron Babbitt joins us
[2:03:29.840 --> 2:03:31.840]  and I really appreciate him coming on.
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:33.840]  Also, they're suing.
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:35.840]  We can't get into the identity of the officer
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:37.840]  who has part of the suit and I understand that
[2:03:37.840 --> 2:03:39.840]  in some cases.
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:41.840]  But we can do everything else. So he's here with us.
[2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:43.840]  GiveSendGo.com
[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:45.840]  forward slash justice for Ashley.
[2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:47.840]  GiveSendGo.com
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:49.840]  forward slash justice for Ashley
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:51.840]  and at for Ashley on Twitter.
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:53.840]  So Aaron Babbitt, thank you so much
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:55.840]  for coming on with us.
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:57.840]  And I'd just like to try to give you the floor to go wherever you want
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:03:59.840]  because I've got so many questions,
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:01.840]  but you're the guy that's really got the answer.
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:03.840]  So give us your take on
[2:04:03.840 --> 2:04:05.840]  Ashley, her memory and what's currently unfolding.
[2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:07.840]  First off, thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:09.840]  I truly do appreciate the opportunity to talk about my wife.
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:11.840]  Any chance I get?
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:13.840]  So thank you.
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:15.840]  It's just been a whirlwind.
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:17.840]  You know, every day
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:19.840]  still feels like January 7th
[2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:21.840]  with complete silence coming out of DC.
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:23.840]  I have to wake up every day
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:25.840]  knowing that I'm going to go
[2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:27.840]  through that day without my best friend.
[2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:29.840]  And then when I go to bed at night,
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:31.840]  I go to bed with a gut punch
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:33.840]  knowing that nobody in DC gives a damn about it.
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:35.840]  So
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:37.840]  I watched these sham
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:39.840]  committee hearings
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:41.840]  and the questions
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:43.840]  that I have
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:45.840]  why these four officers
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:47.840]  they were clearly
[2:04:47.840 --> 2:04:49.840]  selected a long time ago.
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:51.840]  They were clearly reading off the script.
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:53.840]  One of the guys read the word coop.
[2:04:53.840 --> 2:04:55.840]  I mean, you're literally reading this.
[2:04:55.840 --> 2:04:57.840]  And then you've got the crying and the tears
[2:04:57.840 --> 2:04:59.840]  and the crocodile tears
[2:04:59.840 --> 2:05:01.840]  and then you've got the big guy
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:03.840]  whatever his name is.
[2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:05.840]  I can't even remember.
[2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:07.840]  Everybody was calling him the N word
[2:05:07.840 --> 2:05:09.840]  even though they have no footage of it.
[2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:11.840]  Yeah, there's zero footage of it.
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:13.840]  They weren't even smart enough to scrub his social media
[2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:15.840]  before they put him up in front of the world.
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:17.840]  He's got his black power fist up.
[2:05:17.840 --> 2:05:19.840]  He's got his black lives matter.
[2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:21.840]  I don't understand how this guy still has a job
[2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:23.840]  because he clearly has a political bias.
[2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:25.840]  If he's talking
[2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:27.840]  all this smack and trash
[2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:29.840]  on the conservative Republican side,
[2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:31.840]  how can he be expected
[2:05:31.840 --> 2:05:33.840]  to defend them
[2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:35.840]  as needed?
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:37.840]  I mean, he even was joking about the fact that
[2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:39.840]  Trump had to get rust off stage
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:41.840]  during an active shooter.
[2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:43.840]  He was joking about that.
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:45.840]  And that's when Donald Trump was still president.
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:47.840]  Donald Trump still had to go to the house.
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:49.840]  This guy was charged with being outside of secret service.
[2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:51.840]  This guy was going to have to protect him.
[2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:53.840]  How can he still be
[2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:55.840]  on the job?
[2:05:55.840 --> 2:05:57.840]  But the capital police
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:05:59.840]  had a big problem.
[2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:01.840]  Well, that's where I was going to go.
[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:03.840]  I mean, I was going to bring up those horrible hearings last week.
[2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:05.840]  They're going to have more hearings, the crying,
[2:06:05.840 --> 2:06:07.840]  the reading off the scripts,
[2:06:07.840 --> 2:06:09.840]  the suppressing 14,000 hours of footage.
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:11.840]  And then because I was in that crowd,
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:13.840]  I know those people.
[2:06:13.840 --> 2:06:15.840]  Nobody was screaming inward.
[2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:17.840]  My gosh, if you're a black guy in a Trump rally,
[2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:19.840]  you're getting loved on.
[2:06:19.840 --> 2:06:21.840]  I mean, that is a load of BS.
[2:06:21.840 --> 2:06:23.840]  Absolutely is.
[2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:25.840]  And I feel like once all these, you know,
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:27.840]  getting all this surveillance footage,
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:29.840]  and once it all comes out,
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:31.840]  they're going to have to either fire
[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:33.840]  two thirds of their, you know,
[2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:35.840]  of their department,
[2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:37.840]  or we're going to get into where now
[2:06:37.840 --> 2:06:39.840]  we're opening up these satellite offices around the country.
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:41.840]  And to me, that is because they know
[2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:43.840]  that they can't have these guys
[2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:45.840]  sitting in public eye and public view
[2:06:45.840 --> 2:06:47.840]  once they open that house back up.
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:49.840]  So they're going to have to move them somewhere.
[2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:51.840]  So that's, I mean, obviously,
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:53.840]  there's other reasons overreach of power.
[2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:55.840]  I truly believe that these satellite offices
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:06:57.840]  are being opened up to push these guys
[2:06:57.840 --> 2:06:59.840]  so you don't see them at the Capitol anymore.
[2:06:59.840 --> 2:07:01.840]  That was another thing.
[2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:03.840]  Since when can the CDC say
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:05.840]  nobody has to pay rent anymore?
[2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:07.840]  And since when can the Capitol Police
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:09.840]  announce jurisdiction nationwide?
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:11.840]  I mean, this is wild.
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:13.840]  That's insane.
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:15.840]  We're living in Wonderland, man.
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:17.840]  Up is down and left is right.
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:19.840]  Well, you notice that they never want to talk about Ashley,
[2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:21.840]  and I'm sure you saw it.
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:23.840]  The Republican that basically said,
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:25.840]  you know, good job, the officer that killed your wife.
[2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:27.840]  I mean, why do they have to rub it in like that?
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:29.840]  I don't know.
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:31.840]  I don't know.
[2:07:31.840 --> 2:07:33.840]  I mean, you have three or four
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:35.840]  congressmen,
[2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:37.840]  Mark Taylor Greene,
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:39.840]  Dr. Gosar,
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:41.840]  you know, Louis Gomer.
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:43.840]  They're actively supporting my wife
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:45.840]  and supporting our family.
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:47.840]  But that's 90, you know,
[2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:49.840]  it's half of a percent of the 100%,
[2:07:49.840 --> 2:07:51.840]  you know, it's the other 99 and a half.
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:53.840]  They don't give a damn.
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:55.840]  And, you know, I get tired of hearing them
[2:07:55.840 --> 2:07:57.840]  say all the time, you know, who shot Ashley Babbitt.
[2:07:57.840 --> 2:07:59.840]  You sit in that house
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:01.840]  every single day.
[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:03.840]  The guy that shot my wife was supposedly
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:05.840]  the commander of that area.
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:07.840]  You're going to try to tell me you haven't seen them at work
[2:08:07.840 --> 2:08:09.840]  in 216 days.
[2:08:09.840 --> 2:08:11.840]  Everybody knows who the hell did it,
[2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:13.840]  but they just won't talk about it.
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:15.840]  Well, it's very dangerous to have secret police
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:17.840]  that can kill people like 007
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:19.840]  kill one of their own citizens
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:21.840]  and then their name is withheld.
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:23.840]  Again, it's all part of the power grab.
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:25.840]  It's all part of the power grab.
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:27.840]  And I mean, I have the benefit of,
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:29.840]  you know, I carried a gun, Alex,
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:31.840]  for 10 years at the nuclear power plant.
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:33.840]  I was bound to the same
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:35.840]  use of force continuum that this guy is.
[2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:37.840]  I know where he got trained.
[2:08:37.840 --> 2:08:39.840]  He was down in Glenco, Georgia.
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:41.840]  I know they follow the same exact use of force continuum
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:43.840]  and he skipped every single step
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:45.840]  and put a bullet in my wife.
[2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:47.840]  There was no announcement of his presence.
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:49.840]  There was no physical presence
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:51.840]  less than physical force.
[2:08:51.840 --> 2:08:53.840]  There was no use of impact weapons.
[2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:55.840]  My wife's hands were empty.
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:08:57.840]  She was coming through a door.
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:08:59.840]  Her hands were occupied with that door.
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:01.840]  She could have been grabbed from behind
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:03.840]  by one of those officers or he could have walked out.
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:05.840]  I don't even care if he smacked her in the face.
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:07.840]  He just stood there off of the side.
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:09.840]  She never saw him.
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:11.840]  She never heard him and he executed
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:13.840]  there on live TV.
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:15.840]  Wow.
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:17.840]  We're going to go to break here in a moment,
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:19.840]  but let's talk about justice for Ashley
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:21.840]  because that's justice for us all.
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:23.840]  If they can forget her, they can bury her,
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:25.840]  they can then play like they were the victims that day.
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:27.840]  It's very important to get justice.
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:29.840]  I don't take a lot of money to do it.
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:31.840]  I know you didn't want to bring this up,
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:33.840]  but how do people donate and if they do donate
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:35.840]  that justice for Ashley that givesingo.com
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:37.840]  what does that go towards?
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:39.840]  That goes directly to my lawyer,
[2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:41.840]  Robertson Wood.
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:43.840]  It goes directly to the firm.
[2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:45.840]  Every dollar that's donated goes directly to the firm.
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:47.840]  We're going to have, this is David Brooks Goliath.
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:49.840]  We need all the help that we can get.
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:51.840]  Even when lawyers do what it costs,
[2:09:51.840 --> 2:09:53.840]  they got to pay for hotels,
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:55.840]  they got to pay for all the transcripts.
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:57.840]  I've been involved in a lot of lawsuits.
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:09:59.840]  Just the transcripts cost $100,000
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:01.840]  for a big battle over a year or two.
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:03.840]  This is going to be a battle.
[2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:05.840]  I think $500,000 is a low goal.
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:07.840]  You guys will only raise $30,000.
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:09.840]  I would like to see that go up
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:11.840]  $100,000 during the show folks
[2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:13.840]  because it takes money to win a war
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:15.840]  and this is definitely an important fight
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:17.840]  for all of us.
[2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:19.840]  This is a fight for everybody.
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:21.840]  My wife gave her life for this country.
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:23.840]  She wrote a blank check multiple times
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:25.840]  going overseas to war for her life
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:27.840]  and in the end ultimately she gave her life
[2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:29.840]  at the people's house.
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:31.840]  We need all the help we can get
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:33.840]  and this is for every single American
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:35.840]  whether you support my wife or not.
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:37.840]  You don't even know that this is for you too.
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:39.840]  It's for you.
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:41.840]  I understand why she was mad that day
[2:10:41.840 --> 2:10:43.840]  in protesting too.
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:45.840]  The Democrats take over buildings all the time.
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:47.840]  She didn't even do it violently but
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:49.840]  they don't get killed and I don't think
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:51.840]  they should be killed.
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:53.840]  We'll be right back to talk about
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:55.840]  Ashley Babbitt with Aaron Babbitt
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:10:57.840]  straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[2:10:57.840 --> 2:10:59.840]  The Biosecurity State
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:01.840]  is here.
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:03.840]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:05.840]  training us that humans are dirty,
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:07.800]  and we are working to develop
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:09.800]  a circulation of lives in Alaska.
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:10.940]  Ryan Babbitt from Dixie
[2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:11.100]  says he admires the н
[2:11:11.100 --> 2:11:10.080]  community
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:09.840]  says he admires the Community
[2:11:09.840 --> 2:11:11.840]  says he admires the Communist
[2:11:09.840 --> 2:11:11.840]  Diversity
[2:11:11.860 --> 2:11:13.860]  dictatorship of UPIing.
[2:11:12.860 --> 2:11:15.860]  wishes to make Canada the same.
[2:11:12.860 --> 2:11:13.860]  has announced and announced
[2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:15.860]  that they're buying vaccines
[2:11:15.860 --> 2:11:17.860]  for every person in the country
[2:11:17.860 --> 2:11:19.860]  all the way out into 2024.
[2:11:19.860 --> 2:11:21.860]  And in 2024, you will again take
[2:11:21.860 --> 2:11:23.700]  two shots.
[2:11:21.860 --> 2:11:23.860]  two shots.
[2:11:23.860 --> 2:11:25.860]  And he says it'll be whatever
[2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:27.860]  Pfizer cooks out that wants to put in your body.
[2:11:27.860 --> 2:11:29.860]  The Rockifeller Foundation
[2:11:29.860 --> 2:11:31.860]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates
[2:11:31.860 --> 2:11:33.860]  for now implementing it.
[2:11:31.860 --> 2:11:33.860]  And now they've announced
[2:11:33.860 --> 2:12:00.420]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[2:12:00.420 --> 2:12:05.820]  we are told. And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which
[2:12:05.820 --> 2:12:11.380]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate
[2:12:11.380 --> 2:12:16.860]  crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions. Natural functions
[2:12:16.860 --> 2:12:21.780]  which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[2:12:21.780 --> 2:12:26.980]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye. Also described as the seat
[2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:33.100]  of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise
[2:12:33.100 --> 2:12:39.300]  unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland
[2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:44.820]  healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking
[2:12:44.820 --> 2:12:50.620]  water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal. Get them both today
[2:12:50.620 --> 2:13:19.740]  for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:19.740 --> 2:13:25.620]  I know it's got to be hard of Aaron Babbitt, the husband of late Ashley Babbitt to talk
[2:13:25.620 --> 2:13:30.460]  about what happened, but he's doing it so that she doesn't die in vain and that's important.
[2:13:30.460 --> 2:13:35.740]  But I saw you as a guest on Sunday Live here on the M4S Network Sunday night after I did
[2:13:35.740 --> 2:13:40.620]  my two hours and I've watched the whole interview and it really touched my heart talking about
[2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:44.580]  Ashley and meeting her and why she wanted to go to DC and I thought it might be important
[2:13:44.580 --> 2:13:51.860]  to repeat that to this audience. Yeah, so it was back in 2015. I was working
[2:13:51.860 --> 2:13:57.980]  security at a nuclear power plant. Actually, I had done there for about eight and a half
[2:13:57.980 --> 2:14:04.700]  nine years at that point. Ashley had gotten on with the new class and I was down in like
[2:14:04.700 --> 2:14:10.180]  the bowels of this place and it's just 120, 130 degrees. I'd been down there for like
[2:14:10.180 --> 2:14:15.540]  an hour. I came upstairs to the alarm station to get a drink and the new class was in there
[2:14:15.540 --> 2:14:20.100]  and that's the last thing I wanted to deal with. So I just walked around, put my gun
[2:14:20.100 --> 2:14:26.540]  away and was getting a drink and it comes little old Ashley over. Just, hey, you look
[2:14:26.540 --> 2:14:33.140]  like you're grumpy. I'm going to make you talk to me and I'll be damned if she dead.
[2:14:33.140 --> 2:14:39.860]  As the months went on, I shared it up on my shift and we just hit it off and fast forward
[2:14:39.860 --> 2:14:47.500]  to 2017. We decided to make life changes. Her brother was, you know, her whole family
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:51.900]  is out here, so in San Diego. So her brother was working for this bull company and he had
[2:14:51.900 --> 2:14:56.780]  called talking about how they were selling the business. He was interested in just buying
[2:14:56.780 --> 2:15:02.460]  this small little portion and of course Ashley will always, you know, 110% on everything
[2:15:02.460 --> 2:15:07.060]  she does. She's like, well, why don't we look at it and see if we can buy the whole
[2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:11.860]  business. She said it was one of the hardest questions she's ever had to ask me in her
[2:15:11.860 --> 2:15:17.340]  life. I came on from work and she sat me down and she's like, I want to buy a business
[2:15:17.340 --> 2:15:23.260]  and I've done the numbers and I think we can do this. And I just, you know, I looked at
[2:15:23.260 --> 2:15:29.460]  it and I was like, you know what, let's go for it. You know, at that point, you know,
[2:15:29.460 --> 2:15:34.060]  I had already been through a dumpster fire of a marriage earlier, you know, when I was
[2:15:34.060 --> 2:15:39.940]  in the military and I had swore I'd never get married again. This girl comes around
[2:15:39.940 --> 2:15:45.060]  and just completely changed my life. So we uprooted, we were across the country, moved
[2:15:45.060 --> 2:15:52.500]  out here to San Diego and bought our small business. We were living a very ideal life.
[2:15:52.500 --> 2:15:58.020]  It was, you know, it was beautiful. We lived three blocks from the beach, going to work
[2:15:58.020 --> 2:16:05.460]  every day. When I say we literally spend 20 hours a day together. It's not an underestimation.
[2:16:05.460 --> 2:16:10.180]  I mean, if we were together, if we were apart for four hours, even that was kind of a stretch
[2:16:10.180 --> 2:16:15.100]  without, you know, I got to work sometime. So you guys were really in love and really
[2:16:15.100 --> 2:16:20.980]  had hit it off. Yeah, I mean, she was my best friend. She's
[2:16:20.980 --> 2:16:25.100]  a love of my life. Well, I know it's hard for you to talk about, but you know, those
[2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:29.660]  cops sat up there and cried and called her by terrorist and white supremacist totalize.
[2:16:29.660 --> 2:16:33.340]  And it was just disgraceful. You're holding it together here, but I can tell you really
[2:16:33.340 --> 2:16:37.620]  loved her. I think it's important to humanize her. What was it like? How did you learn?
[2:16:37.620 --> 2:16:40.620]  I'm sorry to have to ask this, but we have to humanize her because they want to dehumanize
[2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:46.820]  her. What was it like for you, Aaron? How did you find out they'd, they'd shot your wife?
[2:16:46.820 --> 2:16:52.420]  So it was back, you know, in January, we're still heavily locked down for COVID here in
[2:16:52.420 --> 2:16:57.620]  County, California. So we had to make, I had to make a gym reservation, only go at a certain
[2:16:57.620 --> 2:17:02.660]  hour. So I made one for one o'clock and it was like somewhere in the 11 o'clock hour
[2:17:02.660 --> 2:17:08.060]  of my time. I got a call and it was kind of random. I don't normally really talk to this
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:14.820]  person, but called saying his wife had seen what she thought was Ashley on TV and it looked
[2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:21.740]  like she had gotten hurt. So I turned my TV on and it just happened to be on Fox when
[2:17:21.740 --> 2:17:27.700]  I, when I turned it on and I, the first image that I saw was my wife laying on the, on the
[2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:31.220]  ground there with the blood coming out of her mouth.
[2:17:31.220 --> 2:17:32.460]  Wow.
[2:17:32.460 --> 2:17:37.660]  My original, my original thought was, you know, there's no way somebody fired a live round
[2:17:37.660 --> 2:17:44.020]  inside of Capitol. Maybe it was a rubber bullet that hit her in the wrong way, you know, but
[2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:50.020]  I was forced at that point because I started calling all these hospitals trying to find
[2:17:50.020 --> 2:17:56.460]  her and nobody would tell me anything, even to the point where my brother called the DC
[2:17:56.460 --> 2:18:03.780]  Metro dispatch and they yelled at him, the exact words were, we didn't eff and shoot
[2:18:03.780 --> 2:18:07.900]  her, stop calling and they hung up on her.
[2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:15.140]  So I was locked in and forced to watch these graphic images over and over and over again
[2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:22.380]  because I was getting no calls from anybody in DC at that point. I had to watch it. That's
[2:18:22.380 --> 2:18:27.780]  the only place I was getting updates or any could get an update on what had happened to
[2:18:27.780 --> 2:18:34.180]  Ashley. And then I heard the voice and I'll hear for the rest of my life came over and
[2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:42.060]  said the woman that had been shot at the Capitol had passed away and everything went black
[2:18:42.060 --> 2:18:47.540]  after that. You know, I talked to my neighbors after and they said it sounded like I wanted
[2:18:47.540 --> 2:18:53.020]  dying animals inside my house, which I don't remember much of it. You know, people, I looked
[2:18:53.020 --> 2:18:58.500]  up and there were friends that were in my house and I don't even remember them coming
[2:18:58.500 --> 2:19:07.500]  in. So yeah, that's, that's, I watched my wife die on TV and for a man to see, you know,
[2:19:07.500 --> 2:19:16.340]  like I said, the absolute love of my life. It's been 3,000 miles away, but the TV was
[2:19:16.340 --> 2:19:22.620]  like a window to me that I couldn't get my hands through to comfort her and, you know,
[2:19:22.620 --> 2:19:31.820]  to see the cameras in her face and the people in her face. And I know the last view that
[2:19:31.820 --> 2:19:37.380]  she had out of her eyes before the life was drained out was of strangers. And I just wanted
[2:19:37.380 --> 2:19:43.340]  to, I wanted my, my face to be there to let her know you're going to be okay and you'll
[2:19:43.340 --> 2:19:44.340]  love it.
[2:19:44.340 --> 2:19:49.300]  Well, that's a powerful testimony, Aaron. I appreciate you doing that for America and
[2:19:49.300 --> 2:19:54.540]  your wife who lives on. We all know that hopefully we do the right thing. We'll be with our friends
[2:19:54.540 --> 2:19:59.220]  and family again, as we know that God's real. But what would you like to see come out of
[2:19:59.220 --> 2:20:03.860]  this now? Because, you know, at first I'm like, it's wrong that this happened, but who
[2:20:03.860 --> 2:20:07.580]  knows what else went on. And it's hysteria, but then to watch them attacker and call her
[2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:12.620]  names and to see this Republican Congressman say the cop did a good job and all that, they're
[2:20:12.620 --> 2:20:16.340]  really rubber than in. I mean, I'd like to see the people that did this. I'd like to
[2:20:16.340 --> 2:20:20.020]  see the guy that did this sent to prison. I mean, I think he premeditatedly executed
[2:20:20.020 --> 2:20:23.300]  your wife. And I know you don't want to get into the case itself, but what are you hoping
[2:20:23.300 --> 2:20:24.300]  to see here?
[2:20:24.300 --> 2:20:28.380]  Well, I mean, they've already taken away the ability to charge her criminally at this
[2:20:28.380 --> 2:20:34.940]  point. And if you go back to February, there was a Wall Street Journal article that came
[2:20:34.940 --> 2:20:40.260]  out that said that, you know, the investigation into the shooting of my wife was ongoing,
[2:20:40.260 --> 2:20:44.660]  but they probably weren't going to be recommending charges. And DC Metro never came out and squashed
[2:20:44.660 --> 2:20:52.860]  that leak. So fast forward to April. That's when we got the official call from the Internal
[2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:58.220]  Affairs Detective at DC Metro telling me in my attorney that they weren't present charges
[2:20:58.220 --> 2:21:04.100]  and I'm just like, you leak this out back in February. So why did you string it along
[2:21:04.100 --> 2:21:10.460]  this long? So at this point, it's going to have to come down to, you know, at a minimum
[2:21:10.460 --> 2:21:15.140]  termination termination of this officer. I mean, he's not fit for duty. You can look
[2:21:15.140 --> 2:21:19.420]  up a lot of big foundations and groups should be supporting you. We don't want police getting
[2:21:19.420 --> 2:21:23.260]  away with executing people. Where's all the black lives matter? Where's all the cop hating
[2:21:23.260 --> 2:21:24.260]  organizations?
[2:21:24.260 --> 2:21:28.300]  I mean, this is a clear execution right here. And then, but oh, because it's a veteran, they
[2:21:28.300 --> 2:21:29.300]  don't care.
[2:21:29.300 --> 2:21:34.660]  Yeah. And well, the National Police Association came out and called it a bad shoot. Good.
[2:21:34.660 --> 2:21:38.740]  You have that going on. And somebody, you know, somebody needs to take notice of that
[2:21:38.740 --> 2:21:43.620]  for a sake. But stay there, Aaron. Let's come back and talk about that. The fact that there
[2:21:43.620 --> 2:21:45.980]  are a lot of good police that are actually against what happened. We're not attacking
[2:21:45.980 --> 2:21:50.460]  all police. We're attacking these political special officers. These leftist officers,
[2:21:50.460 --> 2:21:54.340]  a bunch of them are basically like an antifa. I mean, that collection of guys they had up
[2:21:54.340 --> 2:21:55.340]  there last week.
[2:21:55.340 --> 2:21:57.580]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:21:57.580 --> 2:22:03.220]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[2:22:03.220 --> 2:22:08.620]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems
[2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:13.900]  provide a life-saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators, solar
[2:22:13.900 --> 2:22:20.060]  generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity
[2:22:20.060 --> 2:22:24.980]  from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting
[2:22:24.980 --> 2:22:30.020]  off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again. Even
[2:22:30.020 --> 2:22:36.020]  better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.

[2:23:46.540 --> 2:23:59.220]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers
[2:23:59.220 --> 2:24:03.500]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do. But because
[2:24:03.500 --> 2:24:07.780]  they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still
[2:24:07.780 --> 2:24:12.540]  have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power. But when I'm not
[2:24:12.540 --> 2:24:18.900]  using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[2:24:18.900 --> 2:24:23.180]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated. They fit almost all types of androids
[2:24:23.180 --> 2:24:31.060]  and iPhones at 50% off $14.95. They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long. We've got
[2:24:31.060 --> 2:24:37.980]  a private label with info wars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and

[2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:37.740]  to your cancel culture. We're going to bring the word out on our own. Your best special
[2:25:37.740 --> 2:25:43.180]  is using the promo code alex and you're supporting us getting the word out with alex's great
[2:25:43.180 --> 2:25:49.340]  show at infowarst and you're supporting mypilla, 2,500 employees, and I haven't had to lay
[2:25:49.340 --> 2:25:52.140]  anybody off in spite of trying to be an attacked and camp.
[2:25:52.140 --> 2:26:00.580]  You're an example of resistance, Mike Lindell, Godspeed. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:26:00.580 --> 2:26:19.980]  show. America is being held hostage by corporate interest that are manipulating the left and
[2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:24.700]  they're spoiling for a war. And just off what happened to the Capitol, a million people
[2:26:24.700 --> 2:26:30.180]  came for Trump's rally. We had some provocateurs, the police scuffles, then the police opened
[2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:36.100]  up the gates. 500, 600 people went in, maybe 20 were violent. And then other people got
[2:26:36.100 --> 2:26:44.900]  killed and others are rotting under the federal jail there in D.C., some of which have had
[2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:50.580]  their eyes knocked out, some of which have never been let out of solitary confinement.
[2:26:50.580 --> 2:26:55.460]  So Ashley's left this plane of existence, but you look at the persecution of people
[2:26:55.460 --> 2:27:00.580]  that were just there, little old ladies holding American flags. Aaron Babbit, husband of Ashley
[2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:04.860]  Babbit, what is it like for you to see that? What's your view of that whole fiasco and
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:05.860]  where that's going?
[2:27:05.860 --> 2:27:15.100]  I'm not naive to the fact that having my wife not been murdered, I'd be standing right alongside
[2:27:15.100 --> 2:27:21.740]  these other families. Ashley would probably be in jail right now, which is what it is.
[2:27:21.740 --> 2:27:29.980]  They killed her. So to have these guys locked up with no due process, and I keep getting
[2:27:29.980 --> 2:27:34.460]  tired of here. I even had to stop doing, I won't even talk to my local Fox affiliate
[2:27:34.460 --> 2:27:39.700]  here because I got sick of them putting the word insurrectionists across the bottom on
[2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:46.740]  their banner. I don't know how you can call people an insurrectionist without being charged
[2:27:46.740 --> 2:27:52.300]  with insurrection. To me, every talking head out there, every person that's calling these
[2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:59.180]  people insurrectionists, they should be immediately sued for slander, defamation of character.
[2:27:59.180 --> 2:28:03.740]  That's no different than my neighbor calling the news and saying, Aaron, Babbit's a murderer.
[2:28:03.740 --> 2:28:08.580]  Did he kill anybody? I don't know. I don't understand how you can keep calling these
[2:28:08.580 --> 2:28:14.220]  people insurrectionists without them being charged with insurrection.
[2:28:14.220 --> 2:28:19.620]  I got up on the chairs, they had stacks of chairs there, and I said, listen, folks, don't
[2:28:19.620 --> 2:28:23.500]  go in the Capitol. We're going to get another Kent State. Not that people deserve to get
[2:28:23.500 --> 2:28:28.460]  shot or even arrested, the ones that were peaceful, but I had a bad feeling. I'm like,
[2:28:28.460 --> 2:28:32.620]  don't go in, but obviously almost no one can hear me because the crowd was so huge. By
[2:28:32.620 --> 2:28:38.580]  the time the officers opened the doors up and let people in, the fact that they can keep
[2:28:38.580 --> 2:28:43.900]  people in jail who've shown in court, I've talked to their lawyers, the video of them
[2:28:43.900 --> 2:28:49.220]  being waved in and then they were nonviolent. They're being charged with garbage, but as
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:53.180]  you said, they're not being charged with insurrection because they didn't do that.
[2:28:53.180 --> 2:29:00.700]  Right. And I just read something that's on my legal team for Ashley. That is run by my
[2:29:00.700 --> 2:29:03.820]  legal team. A lot of people think I'm on there. They go on there and they say a bunch of
[2:29:03.820 --> 2:29:07.980]  really bad stuff, but the joke's on you. I'm not running that thing, so you're not talking
[2:29:07.980 --> 2:29:15.420]  to me. But they just put something up there saying that the government admitted, you can
[2:29:15.420 --> 2:29:24.620]  read it, the government admitted that, yes, there is video footage of police letting protesters
[2:29:24.620 --> 2:29:29.740]  inside the Capitol building. Yes, there are pictures and videos of Capitol Police fist
[2:29:29.740 --> 2:29:36.060]  bumping and hugging. There you go, right there. Yep. So, I mean, you see it right there,
[2:29:36.060 --> 2:29:41.500]  but they're still at the very end, but we're still looking into it. Come on.
[2:29:41.500 --> 2:29:46.580]  Yeah. So we know what happened. Select groups got in fights with the cops. The cops got
[2:29:46.580 --> 2:29:51.420]  in fights with them. People got carried away. And then the police outside pulled back the
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:56.740]  metal barriers and waved everyone in and then opened the doors. So who gave that order?
[2:29:56.740 --> 2:30:01.740]  Who set up everybody? And then let the emotions get out of control.
[2:30:01.740 --> 2:30:08.660]  Yeah. Who gave that order? And you talked to that gentleman, Kara talked to him on
[2:30:08.660 --> 2:30:15.020]  Sunday that there was there with Mrs. Boylan. And they've been lying about her from the
[2:30:15.020 --> 2:30:21.340]  get-go. It appears that there's going to be, at this point in time, at least three deaths
[2:30:21.340 --> 2:30:26.340]  on the Capitol Police hands. But nobody wants to talk about that in the mainstream media.
[2:30:26.340 --> 2:30:30.060]  Well, that was my next question. You're dead on. What about the other people? We're now
[2:30:30.060 --> 2:30:34.220]  learning at least three, probably four others were murdered as well.
[2:30:34.220 --> 2:30:40.420]  Yeah. And, you know, I, you have to believe these people that were down there in that
[2:30:40.420 --> 2:30:49.940]  crowd to say that the violence that was coming from the citizens was a reaction to the violence
[2:30:49.940 --> 2:30:56.660]  being, you know, brought upon them initially by the Capitol Police. These guys aren't prepared
[2:30:56.660 --> 2:31:03.460]  for that. And to say that we have a police force that is supposed to protect the Capitol
[2:31:03.460 --> 2:31:09.660]  building, the center of the world for all intents and purposes, and they're not prepared
[2:31:09.660 --> 2:31:15.900]  for a large scale demonstration like that. There has to be a complete revamping of this
[2:31:15.900 --> 2:31:21.420]  of this agency, apartment, whatever you want to call it. And it needs to start from the
[2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:22.420]  top where, you know,
[2:31:22.420 --> 2:31:27.660]  Well, we also know that Trump asked the National Guard 10 days before, five days before and
[2:31:27.660 --> 2:31:32.180]  was refused. That's how it works is the Democrats control the district. So they somehow blocked
[2:31:32.180 --> 2:31:36.860]  him unless he wanted to send in federalized troops, but they, they denied him the National
[2:31:36.860 --> 2:31:37.860]  Guard.
[2:31:37.860 --> 2:31:43.380]  Yeah. It was a setup from the beginning. It was a setup from the beginning to make him
[2:31:43.380 --> 2:31:45.100]  look horrible and make him look bad.
[2:31:45.100 --> 2:31:48.220]  Well, if anybody knows what happened, because I've even talked to a lot of people that
[2:31:48.220 --> 2:31:55.580]  want to research, do we know what wave actually went in with what happened and any other details
[2:31:55.580 --> 2:31:57.300]  of that day?
[2:31:57.300 --> 2:32:06.140]  I don't know those details. I mean, I know if you want to put the timeline down, I mean,
[2:32:06.140 --> 2:32:10.100]  she had sent me a text saying that she had just watched, you know, big guy, you know,
[2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:16.820]  President Trump and Don Jr. and Kimberly and Eric. So for her to get from where that speech
[2:32:16.820 --> 2:32:24.420]  was to slow walk to the Capitol, I have to imagine it was well after the first or second
[2:32:24.420 --> 2:32:26.380]  wave that went in there.
[2:32:26.380 --> 2:32:31.700]  Yeah, because I didn't hear there had been a shot fired until I'd basically given up
[2:32:31.700 --> 2:32:35.380]  trying to get people out because the cops let everybody in. And I went to the police
[2:32:35.380 --> 2:32:40.080]  and I said, you have loudspeakers all over the grounds. I know you do. I've seen documentaries
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:43.460]  about it. You need to get on there and say get out of the Capitol. And they said, let
[2:32:43.460 --> 2:32:47.060]  me call my captain. The captain said, nope, not going to happen. I said, well, I'm going
[2:32:47.060 --> 2:32:50.660]  to go up on the steps, try to get them out of here. And he said, go ahead. It's on video.
[2:32:50.660 --> 2:32:55.220]  But I mean, look, you've done security, you know about this stuff. The next day they had
[2:32:55.220 --> 2:33:00.060]  blaring loudspeakers all over the city saying you can't be outside deafening. They had those
[2:33:00.060 --> 2:33:04.820]  loudspeakers mounted all over the Capitol. Why didn't they use them to say get out of
[2:33:04.820 --> 2:33:07.820]  here?
[2:33:07.820 --> 2:33:12.300]  I honestly believe they wanted them in there. They wanted them in there. I think my wife
[2:33:12.300 --> 2:33:18.580]  was led to her death. I'm not going to give up on that. They're not going to silence.
[2:33:18.580 --> 2:33:25.460]  So as long as I stay loud and I stay at the surface, I'm going to be screaming about the
[2:33:25.460 --> 2:33:27.460]  injustice that was done to my wife.
[2:33:27.460 --> 2:33:31.620]  Well, listen, Aaron, I love my audience and they keep us on air despite all the Democrat
[2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:35.260]  party lawsuits and attacks. And they're the best. And I come to them over and over and
[2:33:35.260 --> 2:33:40.340]  over, people like you, but I got to be honest with you. Looking at your go fund me thing,
[2:33:40.340 --> 2:33:45.820]  give send go.com, sports life justice for Ashley. I know what legal stuff like this costs.
[2:33:45.820 --> 2:33:51.380]  $500,000 is a very low number in today's numbers because he's decent lawyers and all the system
[2:33:51.380 --> 2:33:58.340]  cost money. You've only raised $34,000 and that's 6% of the goal. And I'm just going
[2:33:58.340 --> 2:34:02.380]  to tell the listeners, they're in the better place in my view to support justice than to
[2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:07.020]  do this. And this needs to come out because they're using this capital event to set up
[2:34:07.020 --> 2:34:12.620]  a police state in America and declare patriots terrorist officially, which is very important,
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:16.100]  not just for her memory, not just for her husband, which is important. It's important
[2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:21.620]  for all of us that we use her as a standard against them of what they did to her and not
[2:34:21.620 --> 2:34:25.380]  just let them make her go away and forget her. So I think it's a very important place
[2:34:25.380 --> 2:34:31.940]  to go. Give send go.com forward slash justice for Ashley, whether it's $5 or $100. That
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:35.900]  is one of the most important things you can do to fight back against this tyranny because
[2:34:35.900 --> 2:34:40.220]  through the legal process, they're going to be able to legally expose who did this and
[2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:44.140]  hopefully get the 14,000 hours of footage to show what really happened. And that's why
[2:34:44.140 --> 2:34:47.660]  they're stalling because they want to put out a fake narrative.
[2:34:47.660 --> 2:34:56.060]  And hopefully the radio transmissions as well. That has to be included. We need every dollar
[2:34:56.060 --> 2:35:03.340]  that we can get to help. Any amount, like Alex said, $5, 10, even a single dollar, it's
[2:35:03.340 --> 2:35:09.100]  going to go to this fight. And this fight is not just for Ashley. This fight is for America
[2:35:09.100 --> 2:35:15.500]  and this fight is for our civil liberties and our freedom. And it's being ripped away
[2:35:15.500 --> 2:35:22.820]  from us in front of our faces and the blatancy of it. They don't care. They think you were
[2:35:22.820 --> 2:35:27.820]  all stupid. They think every one of us is an idiot. And we're just going to go along
[2:35:27.820 --> 2:35:33.100]  with the flow or shut the TV off and not pay attention to what's going on. Stop paying
[2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:38.740]  attention to the mainstream news. Do your own research. Look deeper. There's a blatant
[2:35:38.740 --> 2:35:43.780]  cover up going on at what happened at the Capitol that day. And my wife was public
[2:35:43.780 --> 2:35:47.500]  enemy number one on their list. And they took her out.
[2:35:47.500 --> 2:35:50.460]  They did. Aaron Babbitt, very powerful. I'm going to make a donation. Thank you, sir.
[2:35:50.460 --> 2:35:57.460]  Come back again very, very soon. Make a donation, guys. $1,000 right now.
[2:35:57.460 --> 2:36:00.460]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:01.460]  Good, bro.
[2:36:01.460 --> 2:36:05.500]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's
[2:36:05.500 --> 2:36:10.180]  basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and
[2:36:10.180 --> 2:36:13.100]  absurdity. It's like we're living at a twilight zone and...
[2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:16.100]  All right. Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:36:16.100 --> 2:36:19.180]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug
[2:36:19.180 --> 2:36:23.780]  out for one of the product. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on
[2:36:23.780 --> 2:36:27.500]  the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the M4.
[2:36:27.500 --> 2:36:30.500]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[2:36:30.500 --> 2:36:32.820]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:36:32.820 --> 2:36:38.260]  Honor, talk to you. Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products.
[2:36:38.260 --> 2:36:44.300]  Alpha Power, even at $29. If you ask my better half, she loves it. And it helps in the bedroom.
[2:36:44.300 --> 2:36:46.300]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[2:36:46.300 --> 2:36:50.300]  It definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[2:37:17.300 --> 2:37:23.300]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:37:23.300 --> 2:37:27.300]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there
[2:37:27.300 --> 2:37:31.300]  healthier, happier, and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:37:31.300 --> 2:37:34.300]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door
[2:37:34.300 --> 2:37:38.300]  and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:37:38.300 --> 2:37:42.300]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?
[2:37:42.300 --> 2:37:46.300]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to go to infowars.com.
[2:37:46.300 --> 2:37:50.300]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the groupthink.
[2:37:50.300 --> 2:38:14.300]  Drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[2:38:20.300 --> 2:38:24.300]  The fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty in the sunset,
[2:38:24.300 --> 2:38:28.300]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband,
[2:38:28.300 --> 2:38:32.300]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[2:38:32.300 --> 2:38:36.300]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:40.300]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:38:40.300 --> 2:38:45.300]  So don't worship the globalist. Don't worship the NFL. Don't worship all the things in the system.
[2:38:45.300 --> 2:38:50.300]  But worship the things of God because we're made by God. And appreciate your consciousness.
[2:38:50.300 --> 2:39:16.300]  And appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:39:16.300 --> 2:39:21.300]  You can get my Geese and Dream Sheets, normally $100 a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[2:39:21.300 --> 2:39:27.300]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[2:39:27.300 --> 2:39:32.300]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium. I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox,
[2:39:32.300 --> 2:39:35.300]  you know what, I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:37.300]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:42.300]  Your best special is using the promo code Alex and you're supporting us getting the word out.
[2:39:42.300 --> 2:39:48.300]  With Alex's great show, him for worse, and you're supporting my pillow, 2,500 employees.
[2:39:48.300 --> 2:39:52.300]  And I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack.
[2:39:52.300 --> 2:40:21.300]  Beautiful, you're an example of resistance, Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[2:40:21.300 --> 2:40:26.300]  Seems like a hundred years ago, at the same time like it was five minutes ago.
[2:40:26.300 --> 2:40:30.300]  January 6th, huge successful million person rally.
[2:40:30.300 --> 2:40:34.300]  Suddenly taken control of by provocateurs.
[2:40:34.300 --> 2:40:36.300]  Capital breach.
[2:40:36.300 --> 2:40:41.300]  And a good hour before Ashley Abbott got executed, there I was saying, don't go in the building.
[2:40:41.300 --> 2:40:49.300]  I sense, I can't state where, you know, the military shot some of those peaceful anti-war protesters.
[2:40:49.300 --> 2:40:52.300]  And sure as hell, it happened. Here's the clip.
[2:41:19.300 --> 2:41:20.300]  All the way around.
[2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:44.300]  And I had a lot of families trying to get thanks here, but I'm showing true story.
[2:41:44.300 --> 2:41:47.300]  Call me and email us and say thank you.
[2:41:47.300 --> 2:41:50.300]  We were there, we didn't know, we almost went in.
[2:41:50.300 --> 2:41:54.300]  Because I kept saying, tell people in front of you, pass it down, they can't hear me.
[2:41:54.300 --> 2:41:56.300]  Don't go in, it's a trap, it's a trap.
[2:41:56.300 --> 2:42:01.300]  I spoke for like 15 minutes just on top of that pile of chairs, stacks of chairs.
[2:42:01.300 --> 2:42:07.300]  And so thank God, thank God my security guys actually, because I got there.
[2:42:07.300 --> 2:42:09.300]  I'm like, what the hell is going on?
[2:42:09.300 --> 2:42:11.300]  We're like 300 yards back, we see flashbangs.
[2:42:11.300 --> 2:42:20.300]  Looks like something out of a medieval, you know, scene, people climbing up rafters and everything, parapets.
[2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:22.300]  And I was just stunned.
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:30.300]  And one of the guys that had been a Sergeant Major in the Army, he goes, you got to get up on top,
[2:42:30.300 --> 2:42:33.300]  one of these piles, one of these things, you got to stop this right now.
[2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:35.300]  You got to stop them going in there right now.
[2:42:35.300 --> 2:42:38.300]  I said, okay, you're right, I need to stop it.
[2:42:38.300 --> 2:42:44.300]  But I was actually shell shocked for a minute because the image of the US Capitol and all these people
[2:42:44.300 --> 2:42:49.300]  and what I was seeing, riot police beating people on the head and tear gas hit me right in the face.
[2:42:49.300 --> 2:42:51.300]  I'm like, I'm like 300 yards back.
[2:42:51.300 --> 2:42:56.300]  I'm like, like a movie, this ball of tear gas goes right in my face.
[2:42:56.300 --> 2:43:02.300]  And I was like, I'm having a memory of that here for a second.
[2:43:02.300 --> 2:43:04.300]  What a fiasco.
[2:43:04.300 --> 2:43:08.300]  And again, it's not about me, it's about the left being such liars.
[2:43:08.300 --> 2:43:14.300]  I cannot tell you how many times I've trended number one on Twitter or in the top 10 on Twitter
[2:43:14.300 --> 2:43:23.300]  because they're wanting to arrest me and they take video of me in Georgia in November in the Capitol.
[2:43:23.300 --> 2:43:30.300]  And they have investigative reports and they go, look, here's Jones in the Capitol planning the attack
[2:43:30.300 --> 2:43:34.300]  with Congressman Gozer the day before.
[2:43:34.300 --> 2:43:36.300]  And I'm not even with Congressman Gozer.
[2:43:36.300 --> 2:43:38.300]  He wasn't in Georgia.
[2:43:38.300 --> 2:43:39.300]  He's from like Arizona.
[2:43:39.300 --> 2:43:41.300]  None of it's even true.
[2:43:41.300 --> 2:43:47.300]  I mean, it's just next level and it's journalists saying this.
[2:43:47.300 --> 2:43:54.300]  These are accredited people saying, here's Jones planning the attack.
[2:43:54.300 --> 2:43:57.300]  And it's the Georgia Capitol with a peaceful photo op.
[2:43:57.300 --> 2:43:59.300]  Photo op we did with the state rep.
[2:43:59.300 --> 2:44:02.300]  I got state senator.
[2:44:02.300 --> 2:44:06.300]  So, and that's why it's so hard to beat the left unless you just reject everything they say.
[2:44:06.300 --> 2:44:13.300]  But then your brain is designed to kind of halfway believe like, well, maybe Jones was in the US Capitol and replanting a deal.
[2:44:13.300 --> 2:44:22.300]  Because, you know, it's like, it's so crazy how they lie that it's hard to figure out, okay, I need to hit this.
[2:44:22.300 --> 2:44:27.300]  This was big news yesterday, but I want to get to it today because I skipped it.
[2:44:27.300 --> 2:44:33.300]  Bazaar White House deploys Gen Z influencer to push experimental COVID jab.
[2:44:33.300 --> 2:44:41.300]  I want to do that, but I also want to just say this right now.
[2:44:41.300 --> 2:44:54.300]  The document that the CDC put out about sheltering cities says about a 30 year population might be at risk.
[2:44:54.300 --> 2:44:58.300]  Old people, homeless minorities and others.
[2:44:58.300 --> 2:45:13.300]  So we're going to forcibly take you, not even because you have COVID, and we're going to put you in community camps and have the federal government and these COVID tracers along with these environmental cores take over.
[2:45:13.300 --> 2:45:19.300]  And then they just got their funding in the infrastructure package.
[2:45:19.300 --> 2:45:26.300]  So when you've got a headline like red alert emergency broadcast CDC announces plans to put millions of Americans in forced labor camps.
[2:45:26.300 --> 2:45:31.300]  That's a real plan they're trying to implement ahead of the election next year.
[2:45:31.300 --> 2:45:42.300]  I mean, believe me, when you see this stuff, it's hard to deal with, but I mean, it's the reality.
[2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:49.300]  We got some breaking news on the stimulus package on the infrastructure package.
[2:45:49.300 --> 2:45:51.300]  You knew they do this.
[2:45:51.300 --> 2:45:57.300]  Since they got what they wanted, they're now holding in hostage for 3.5 trillion more with even worse crap in it.
[2:45:57.300 --> 2:46:07.300]  It's not enough to outlaw criticizing Fauci or put cameras in your car that watch you or put transgenders in five year olds bathrooms and pay for transgender sex changes.
[2:46:07.300 --> 2:46:17.300]  But now they're holding in hostage new breaking news exclusive.
[2:46:17.300 --> 2:46:29.300]  Nancy Pelosi will hold 1.2 trillion infrastructure package hostage to force Senate Democrats to vote for additional 3.5 trillion bill separately.
[2:46:29.300 --> 2:46:31.300]  I'm not complaining.
[2:46:31.300 --> 2:46:38.300]  I'm not. I'm very thankful to viewers and listeners. You're awesome. You're amazing. You've changed the world.
[2:46:38.300 --> 2:46:47.300]  Imagine a world without info wars, all these guests and all these hosts and all the breaking news and the talking points that we research and create that are then picked up by Congress and by Tucker Carlson and so many others who do an even better job of the material than we do.
[2:46:47.300 --> 2:46:51.300]  They even do more research and add to it and make it even more powerful.
[2:46:51.300 --> 2:46:53.300]  I get a lot of news from Tucker as well.
[2:46:53.300 --> 2:46:55.300]  I'm not saying I'm the fountain of his news.
[2:46:55.300 --> 2:46:58.300]  I'm just saying we're having a lot of influence with our information.
[2:46:58.300 --> 2:47:00.300]  We do a lot of important research.
[2:47:00.300 --> 2:47:03.300]  And we can't do it without your financial support.
[2:47:03.300 --> 2:47:11.300]  And I'm sitting there doing accounting and the crew hasn't gotten a bonus since Christmas and they deserve a bonus.
[2:47:11.300 --> 2:47:13.300]  So I signed a bonus form today.
[2:47:13.300 --> 2:47:16.300]  It was half the extra money we have in the business account.
[2:47:16.300 --> 2:47:19.300]  And I just believe more money is going to come in so we can keep operating.
[2:47:19.300 --> 2:47:26.300]  But it's the first time we've had any meaningful surplus since Christmas because we used to get a lot of orders in November and December.
[2:47:26.300 --> 2:47:31.300]  So I'd like to do a late bonus. Had you the bonus late this year right before Christmas because we didn't have much money.
[2:47:31.300 --> 2:47:32.300]  And I'm not complaining.
[2:47:32.300 --> 2:47:34.300]  It's just I don't have Bloomberg money.
[2:47:34.300 --> 2:47:35.300]  I don't have globalist money.
[2:47:35.300 --> 2:47:39.300]  I've got your money and I appreciate it and I respect you and I thank you for it.
[2:47:39.300 --> 2:47:42.300]  And a lot of our big problems the last year have been the COVID lockdown.
[2:47:42.300 --> 2:47:47.300]  A lot of products that are sellers that we could fund ourselves with are not here.
[2:47:47.300 --> 2:47:51.300]  And we couldn't sell the toothpaste because the Democrats came after that.
[2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:56.300]  But we have our other toothpaste that they say isn't evil and again none of this has anything to do with treating COVID.
[2:47:56.300 --> 2:47:57.300]  It never did.
[2:47:57.300 --> 2:48:00.300]  They just made that up to try to get me indicted.
[2:48:00.300 --> 2:48:06.300]  Just charcoal toothpaste is about cleaning your teeth and having fresh breath has nothing to do with that.
[2:48:06.300 --> 2:48:08.300]  But we we've mass produced it.
[2:48:08.300 --> 2:48:10.300]  We got a big shipment in.
[2:48:10.300 --> 2:48:20.300]  Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal toothpaste natural fluoride free gently cleans teeth freshens breath and amyl safe.
[2:48:20.300 --> 2:48:22.300]  Look, nowhere does it say COVID.
[2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:25.300]  Why the hell would I say toothpaste has to do with COVID?
[2:48:25.300 --> 2:48:27.300]  Nothing to do with it.
[2:48:27.300 --> 2:48:29.300]  They'll probably execute me or something.
[2:48:29.300 --> 2:48:30.300]  I don't know.
[2:48:30.300 --> 2:48:31.300]  It's about a child molester.
[2:48:31.300 --> 2:48:34.300]  But the point is it's high quality doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[2:48:34.300 --> 2:48:38.300]  One of the fastest growing trends in toothpaste is charcoal toothpaste.
[2:48:38.300 --> 2:48:42.300]  I noticed that three years ago went and tried some at the store thought it was amazing.
[2:48:42.300 --> 2:48:47.300]  My dad's a dentist talked to a manufacturer and made one even better than the other great one.
[2:48:47.300 --> 2:48:48.300]  That's what I do.
[2:48:48.300 --> 2:48:49.300]  I go this is a great product.
[2:48:49.300 --> 2:48:51.300]  But we went and made our own.
[2:48:51.300 --> 2:48:53.300]  And it's now back in stock.
[2:48:53.300 --> 2:48:58.300]  We have this toothpaste, not because with the Democrats and Governor Cuomo said we couldn't sell it.
[2:48:58.300 --> 2:48:59.300]  That was the other one.
[2:48:59.300 --> 2:49:04.300]  This is the charcoal we were already developing that just so happened to come out right around the other time.
[2:49:04.300 --> 2:49:06.300]  That are other evil toothpaste.
[2:49:06.300 --> 2:49:08.300]  Gosh, aren't we safe now?
[2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:09.300]  Got banned.
[2:49:09.300 --> 2:49:10.300]  So it's back in stock.
[2:49:10.300 --> 2:49:11.300]  It's 995.
[2:49:11.300 --> 2:49:12.300]  We're really proud of it.
[2:49:12.300 --> 2:49:15.300]  We have the evil mouthwash.
[2:49:15.300 --> 2:49:17.300]  I'll probably get SWAT team for this.
[2:49:17.300 --> 2:49:19.300]  This has nothing to do with COVID.
[2:49:19.300 --> 2:49:21.300]  Okay, I'm just putting that out there.
[2:49:21.300 --> 2:49:28.300]  Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal, cleans whole mouth, fights bad breath, fresh clean feeling.
[2:49:28.300 --> 2:49:30.300]  Isn't that evil?
[2:49:30.300 --> 2:49:31.300]  We also sell t-shirts.
[2:49:31.300 --> 2:49:33.300]  They'll probably arrest me for that.
[2:49:33.300 --> 2:49:34.300]  Or bumper stickers, even worse.
[2:49:34.300 --> 2:49:37.300]  Oxygen's evil, but cyanide's good.
[2:49:37.300 --> 2:49:40.300]  So that's back in stock.
[2:49:40.300 --> 2:49:42.300]  It goes with that infowarstore.com.
[2:49:42.300 --> 2:49:43.300]  We'll tell you what else is back in stock.
[2:49:43.300 --> 2:49:49.300]  Talk about super demonic and horrible, which is good for your immune system and is good for inflammation.

[2:49:58.300 --> 2:50:00.300]  And none of it has atrazine in it.
[2:50:00.300 --> 2:50:02.300]  The stuff that makes frogs sterile.
[2:50:02.300 --> 2:50:05.300]  And yes, the only one that has sex with their male frogs.
[2:50:05.300 --> 2:50:06.300]  And liberals go, that's great.
[2:50:06.300 --> 2:50:07.300]  Being gay is cool.
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:09.300]  Yeah, except the frogs are all dying.
[2:50:09.300 --> 2:50:14.300]  See, there's no more frogs when they don't go boom, boom with the female.
[2:50:14.300 --> 2:50:16.300]  So we sell that evil shirt.
[2:50:16.300 --> 2:50:17.300]  Probably get swat team for that one.
[2:50:17.300 --> 2:50:19.300]  Save the frogs.
[2:50:19.300 --> 2:50:22.300]  And we have the thing to block the contact tracers.

[2:53:54.300 --> 2:53:56.300]  a whole takeover operation.

[2:54:02.300 --> 2:54:03.300]  labor camps.
[2:54:03.300 --> 2:54:07.300]  Let's talk about forced labor and how they're going to put people in your houses.
[2:54:07.300 --> 2:54:09.300]  They're going to quarter people in your houses.
[2:54:09.300 --> 2:54:10.300]  You're like, oh, that won't happen.
[2:54:10.300 --> 2:54:13.300]  They did it all in Europe with the Muslims.
[2:54:13.300 --> 2:54:15.300]  Oh, you live in a tiny apartment.
[2:54:15.300 --> 2:54:16.300]  You're like 80 years old.
[2:54:16.300 --> 2:54:18.300]  We're going to put two Muslims in here with you.
[2:54:18.300 --> 2:54:20.300]  They're going to behead you and everything else.
[2:54:20.300 --> 2:54:21.300]  But that's okay.
[2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:22.300]  Tim Cook's gay.
[2:54:22.300 --> 2:54:31.300]  So, I mean, this is just a sick ruling class above the law, pays no taxes, waging intense
[2:54:31.300 --> 2:54:34.300]  war on the working and middle classes.
[2:54:34.300 --> 2:54:37.300]  I mean, I am just stunned by this.
[2:54:37.300 --> 2:54:41.300]  Stunned by how fast it's moving to actually be living in it now to know it was all coming
[2:54:41.300 --> 2:54:43.300]  to see the preparatory phase and now be here.
[2:54:43.300 --> 2:54:45.300]  Here's a red state article.
[2:54:45.300 --> 2:54:51.300]  New law suit claims major drug makers conspired to restrict cheaper insulin from pharmacies.
[2:54:51.300 --> 2:54:53.300]  Oh, really?
[2:54:53.300 --> 2:54:58.300]  Just like big pharma has conspired to keep you from ivermectin or vitamin C or vitamin D or zinc,
[2:54:58.300 --> 2:55:02.300]  which doctors are having basically 100% effective rates with.
[2:55:02.300 --> 2:55:04.300]  And of course they jacked up insulin prices.
[2:55:04.300 --> 2:55:08.300]  You know, insulin prices doubled when Joe Biden got in.
[2:55:08.300 --> 2:55:10.300]  And so did so much more.
[2:55:10.300 --> 2:55:14.300]  Look, your fuel price is almost doubled because it's about a screw job.
[2:55:14.300 --> 2:55:20.300]  But it's okay because, you know, Democrats are for the people, right?
[2:55:20.300 --> 2:55:22.300]  Wow.
[2:55:22.300 --> 2:55:29.300]  But they passed that nightmare $1.2 trillion spending package that is a mass
[2:55:29.300 --> 2:55:31.300]  ratings infrastructure.
[2:55:31.300 --> 2:55:37.300]  All the transgenderism, all the open borders, all the forced inoculations, all the checkpoints,
[2:55:37.300 --> 2:55:41.300]  all the cameras and breathalyzes in your car by law, watching you.
[2:55:41.300 --> 2:55:45.300]  It's all in there to be implemented and rolled out.
[2:55:45.300 --> 2:55:49.300]  Pelosi says, I'm holding it up in the house till you pass $3.5 trillion.
[2:55:49.300 --> 2:55:52.300]  That they give themselves in their districts.
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:55.300]  I mean, this is the last days of the looting.
[2:55:55.300 --> 2:56:00.300]  And the globalists are all buying houses in Sweden and Switzerland and New Zealand.
[2:56:00.300 --> 2:56:01.300]  They're all leaving.
[2:56:01.300 --> 2:56:03.300]  Hell, their kids are already gone.
[2:56:03.300 --> 2:56:04.300]  They're already gone.
[2:56:04.300 --> 2:56:07.300]  America is to be brought down and sucked dry.
[2:56:07.300 --> 2:56:11.300]  And then they're going to claim it's a race war and burn it to the ground.
[2:56:11.300 --> 2:56:14.300]  The average person is like, I don't want to get called names by the media.
[2:56:14.300 --> 2:56:15.300]  I don't want to.
[2:56:15.300 --> 2:56:18.300]  I'm just going to go along, keep my head down.
[2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:24.300]  And that creates the atmosphere when you don't stand up for freedom.
[2:56:24.300 --> 2:56:26.300]  That creates a vacuum.
[2:56:26.300 --> 2:56:31.300]  And into the vacuum comes every hellish permutation you can imagine.
[2:56:31.300 --> 2:56:36.300]  But believe me, we weren't hit flat footed.
[2:56:36.300 --> 2:56:38.300]  People know about the New World Order.
[2:56:38.300 --> 2:56:39.300]  They know about the globalists.
[2:56:39.300 --> 2:56:40.300]  They know about the depopulation.
[2:56:40.300 --> 2:56:41.300]  They know about what's going on.
[2:56:41.300 --> 2:56:44.300]  And even 5, 10% of people don't go along.
[2:56:44.300 --> 2:56:45.300]  It doesn't succeed.
[2:56:45.300 --> 2:56:46.300]  That's why they're panicking.
[2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:50.300]  Australia is now at 25% injected under martial law.
[2:56:50.300 --> 2:56:52.300]  They'll never hit 30%.
[2:56:52.300 --> 2:56:55.300]  They can never bully 70% into submission.
[2:56:55.300 --> 2:56:56.300]  Here they're at maybe 50.
[2:56:56.300 --> 2:56:57.300]  They say it's higher.
[2:56:57.300 --> 2:56:58.300]  It's not really.
[2:56:58.300 --> 2:57:00.300]  They're panicking here too.
[2:57:00.300 --> 2:57:02.300]  In France, people aren't taking the shot.
[2:57:02.300 --> 2:57:03.300]  So they're under martial law.
[2:57:03.300 --> 2:57:07.300]  This is all to bully you into submission.
[2:57:07.300 --> 2:57:12.300]  A desperate act of desperate control freaks that don't want to run their own lives.
[2:57:12.300 --> 2:57:15.300]  They want to run your lives.
[2:57:15.300 --> 2:57:21.300]  So go now and take the live links from freeworldnews.tv.
[2:57:21.300 --> 2:57:22.300]  That link's open.
[2:57:22.300 --> 2:57:23.300]  It can be shared right now.
[2:57:23.300 --> 2:57:24.300]  It's not being banned anywhere.
[2:57:24.300 --> 2:57:25.300]  We'll ban it later, I'm sure.
[2:57:25.300 --> 2:57:29.300]  Or ban.video, or infowords.com, or newswords.com, or summit.news, Paul's great site.
[2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:36.300]  And share the live feed of the next 55 minutes with Paul Joseph Watson, who takes over the
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:37.300]  fourth hour.
[2:57:37.300 --> 2:57:45.300]  The War Room, 3 p.m. today with Troyer, and then I get on an airplane to go to the Temposium
[2:57:45.300 --> 2:57:47.300]  in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
[2:57:47.300 --> 2:57:52.300]  I'll have live reporting on the ground tomorrow and on Thursday.
[2:57:52.300 --> 2:58:18.300]  We'll be right back.
[2:58:18.300 --> 2:58:44.300]  We'll be right back.
[2:58:44.300 --> 2:59:12.300]  We'll be right back.
[2:59:12.300 --> 2:59:15.300]  We'll be live from London, England.
[2:59:15.300 --> 2:59:18.300]  It's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news.
[2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:19.300]  And we all live.
[2:59:19.300 --> 2:59:21.300]  It is the Summit News Hour.
[2:59:21.300 --> 2:59:27.300]  We've got a lot to talk about during the next 55 minutes, including the big UN climate report,
[2:59:27.300 --> 2:59:32.300]  the big alarmist ecological apocalypse that's apparently going to happen within the next
[2:59:32.300 --> 2:59:33.300]  couple of decades.
[2:59:33.300 --> 2:59:39.300]  From the same people who told us back in the early 1970s that global cooling was the big
[2:59:39.300 --> 2:59:45.300]  ecological apocalypse and that that would necessitate us giving up our freedoms to globalist bodies
[2:59:45.300 --> 2:59:50.300]  like the United Nations, the same people are spewing the same crap once again.
[2:59:50.300 --> 2:59:56.300]  So we're going to get into that into detail and their solutions for apparently stopping
[2:59:56.300 --> 3:00:01.300]  this manmade increase in global temperatures, which of course is the same thing that they've
[3:00:01.300 --> 3:00:05.300]  been trying to pull off for the past 20 years, geoengineering.
[3:00:05.300 --> 3:00:09.300]  A lot of information to come on that.
[3:00:09.300 --> 3:00:15.300]  First, though, could you imagine 18 months ago being told that citizens in major European
[3:00:15.300 --> 3:00:22.300]  capital cities would be forced to show identity papers to prove they've had a government mandated
[3:00:22.300 --> 3:00:28.300]  shot simply to be able to drink a coffee at an outdoor cafe.
[3:00:28.300 --> 3:00:30.300]  That's what's happening in Paris, France right now.
[3:00:30.300 --> 3:00:33.300]  That's what's happening across France right now.
[3:00:33.300 --> 3:00:38.300]  They're literally being told on top of not being able to sit outside and have a coffee,
[3:00:38.300 --> 3:00:44.300]  not even indoors, that they're going to be refused medical treatment in hospitals if
[3:00:44.300 --> 3:00:49.300]  it's non-emergency, if they don't have the vaccine, if they don't have the vaccine passport,
[3:00:49.300 --> 3:00:50.300]  of course.
[3:00:50.300 --> 3:00:52.300]  Who knows what's non-emergency.
[3:00:52.300 --> 3:00:55.300]  Many people turn up, show up to hospital.
[3:00:55.300 --> 3:00:57.300]  It's not an emergency in their own minds.
[3:00:57.300 --> 3:00:59.300]  A few hours later, it quickly becomes one.
[3:00:59.300 --> 3:01:04.300]  Are they going to be denied life-saving treatment at some point because they haven't had the
[3:01:04.300 --> 3:01:05.300]  vaccine?
[3:01:05.300 --> 3:01:11.300]  If you'd have told somebody 18 months ago that uniformed police were threatening people
[3:01:11.300 --> 3:01:16.300]  sitting outside trying to enjoy a coffee in the daytime, that if they hadn't got the proof
[3:01:16.300 --> 3:01:20.300]  that they'd taken the government mandated shot, they would be fine.
[3:01:20.300 --> 3:01:22.300]  They'd be kicked off the premises.
[3:01:22.300 --> 3:01:25.300]  They'd eventually be put in prison.
[3:01:25.300 --> 3:01:29.300]  18 months ago, you would have said that that was pure bread tyranny.
[3:01:29.300 --> 3:01:32.300]  And it's happening in Paris right now.
[3:01:32.300 --> 3:01:34.300]  It's about to happen in Italy.
[3:01:34.300 --> 3:01:35.300]  It's happening in Greece.
[3:01:35.300 --> 3:01:39.300]  It's happening all over the developed world.
[3:01:39.300 --> 3:01:45.300]  Headline, video, French police patrol, cafes asking to see citizens vaccine papers.
[3:01:45.300 --> 3:01:47.300]  We asked how this would be enforced.
[3:01:47.300 --> 3:01:51.300]  Would it be enforced by the business owners, the restaurant owners, the cafe owners themselves?
[3:01:51.300 --> 3:01:54.300]  No, it's literally being enforced by the police.
[3:01:54.300 --> 3:01:58.300]  Not to mention the fact, by the way, which I'm going to get into later in the show.
[3:01:58.300 --> 3:02:03.300]  You have Rwandan refugees literally killing priests.
[3:02:03.300 --> 3:02:08.300]  We've had numerous deaths of priests in France over the past 18 months.
[3:02:08.300 --> 3:02:11.300]  Nice Paris priests literally being beheaded.
[3:02:11.300 --> 3:02:17.300]  The teacher in France who showed the Prophet Mohammed cartoons being beheaded.
[3:02:17.300 --> 3:02:21.300]  Apparently police resources don't need to be concentrated on that.
[3:02:21.300 --> 3:02:26.300]  They need to be concentrated on people having a cup of coffee in a cafe,
[3:02:26.300 --> 3:02:30.300]  in an outside restaurant bar in France.
[3:02:30.300 --> 3:02:35.300]  Video has emerged out of Paris, France, and this is across the country,
[3:02:35.300 --> 3:02:39.300]  showing police patrolling cafes and bars demanding to see people's credentials
[3:02:39.300 --> 3:02:45.300]  and making sure they're not breaking the law by enjoying themselves while on vaccinated.
[3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:48.300]  We've got the video clip in the article.
[3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:52.300]  It starts off with fines of 135 euros and verbal warnings,
[3:02:52.300 --> 3:02:58.300]  but from next week up to 9,000 euro fines in the event of a repeat offense.
[3:02:58.300 --> 3:03:03.300]  The cafe owners, the bar owners, even more draconian fines.
[3:03:03.300 --> 3:03:07.300]  In fact, I think I read recently up to 45,000 euros,
[3:03:07.300 --> 3:03:10.300]  which would put most of these places out of business.
[3:03:10.300 --> 3:03:15.300]  If they don't enforce the COVID passports, which of course they can't,
[3:03:15.300 --> 3:03:18.300]  they don't have the means to do so.
[3:03:18.300 --> 3:03:23.300]  Massive owner as fines, and then if there's another infraction after that,
[3:03:23.300 --> 3:03:30.300]  the owners of the cafes, the restaurants go directly to prison if they don't enforce this.
[3:03:30.300 --> 3:03:38.300]  Pure bread tyranny, like we haven't seen since France was occupied by the Nazis in World War II.
[3:03:38.300 --> 3:03:41.300]  That's not over egg in the case. That's literally what it is.
[3:03:41.300 --> 3:03:43.300]  They've never had it this bad.
[3:03:43.300 --> 3:03:49.300]  There's other footage also emerged of private security train staff and business owners checking the passes,
[3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:52.300]  which confirm vaccination at negative tests.
[3:03:52.300 --> 3:03:55.300]  By the way, that whole negative test thing in France,
[3:03:55.300 --> 3:04:01.300]  initially you could get a free negative test from the government to prove that you didn't have COVID.
[3:04:01.300 --> 3:04:07.300]  They're abolishing that, first you're going to have to pay for the test at ever rising costs.
[3:04:07.300 --> 3:04:09.300]  Then a negative test doesn't even matter.
[3:04:09.300 --> 3:04:13.300]  They're going to wipe that off the slate altogether, so you need to take the vaccine.
[3:04:13.300 --> 3:04:17.300]  Pretty interesting given that the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the virus,
[3:04:17.300 --> 3:04:20.300]  doesn't prevent you from spreading the virus.
[3:04:20.300 --> 3:04:25.300]  They're valuing the taking of the vaccine is more important than having a negative test.
[3:04:25.300 --> 3:04:29.300]  That's being eliminated because it's all about mass conformity.
[3:04:29.300 --> 3:04:33.300]  It's not about stopping the spread of a virus.
[3:04:33.300 --> 3:04:38.300]  So they're doing it in the cafes, they're doing it in the restaurants, as we point out in this article.
[3:04:38.300 --> 3:04:44.300]  A lot of the cafes in Paris right now are basically 75% empty.
[3:04:44.300 --> 3:04:48.300]  Now, for those Americans, the majority of the listeners right now,
[3:04:48.300 --> 3:04:51.300]  who have ever been to France, who have ever been to Paris,
[3:04:51.300 --> 3:04:57.300]  you know that outside cafe culture is an integral part of their modern day civilization.
[3:04:57.300 --> 3:05:02.300]  The fact that at the height of summer, a lot of these cafes are completely empty.
[3:05:02.300 --> 3:05:04.300]  Canada tells you what's going on.
[3:05:04.300 --> 3:05:08.300]  The government claims that the majority of French citizens have had both jabs,
[3:05:08.300 --> 3:05:13.300]  so they've presumably got their conformist vaccine passports.
[3:05:13.300 --> 3:05:18.300]  And yet even some of those people who have had the vaccine are avoiding the cafes,
[3:05:18.300 --> 3:05:22.300]  cafes, restaurants, the bars are going to be put out of business.
[3:05:22.300 --> 3:05:28.300]  And maybe that's a way to resist, a way to rebel against this imposition,
[3:05:28.300 --> 3:05:33.300]  this draconian imposition, the likes of which they've never seen since they were literally occupied.
[3:05:33.300 --> 3:05:36.300]  By the Nazis.
[3:05:36.300 --> 3:05:39.300]  So we have that, we have another Reuters article on this,
[3:05:39.300 --> 3:05:42.300]  which points out the fact that it's not just people who want to go for a coffee,
[3:05:42.300 --> 3:05:46.300]  who are being rejected, headliner of Reuters.
[3:05:46.300 --> 3:05:51.300]  Coffee and croissant in a French cafe, you'll need a COVID pass for that.
[3:05:51.300 --> 3:05:56.300]  The French morning ritual of a coffee and croissant became more complicated on Mondays.
[3:05:56.300 --> 3:06:01.300]  People had to show proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 tests before taking a seat.
[3:06:01.300 --> 3:06:04.300]  A health pass now has to be shown to eat in a restaurant,
[3:06:04.300 --> 3:06:09.300]  drink in a bar, access non-emergency treatment in a hospital.
[3:06:09.300 --> 3:06:14.300]  I remember about a year ago we had articles in the UK suggesting that, quote,
[3:06:14.300 --> 3:06:17.300]  racists should be denied hospital treatment.
[3:06:17.300 --> 3:06:21.300]  So again, that was the entree into people's beliefs,
[3:06:21.300 --> 3:06:26.300]  people's personal political belief systems being used as a raison d'etre
[3:06:26.300 --> 3:06:31.300]  to deny them basic lifestyle activities.
[3:06:31.300 --> 3:06:35.300]  That's now literally the law in France that if you go to a hospital for, quote,
[3:06:35.300 --> 3:06:39.300]  non-emergency treatment, which as I pointed out at the start of the show,
[3:06:39.300 --> 3:06:42.300]  could very quickly turn into emergency treatment.
[3:06:42.300 --> 3:06:46.300]  Why would you go to a hospital if it wasn't deadly serious in the first place,
[3:06:46.300 --> 3:06:49.300]  especially now with all this COVID stuff going on?
[3:06:49.300 --> 3:06:54.300]  If you don't have the vaccine in France as of this moment, as of this day,
[3:06:54.300 --> 3:06:58.300]  and you go to hospital for, quote, non-emergency treatment,
[3:06:58.300 --> 3:07:03.300]  you will be turned away potentially to die.
[3:07:03.300 --> 3:07:07.300]  Into city train travel going from one French city to another,
[3:07:07.300 --> 3:07:10.300]  you don't have the vaccine, you don't have the vaccine passport,
[3:07:10.300 --> 3:07:14.300]  you don't travel, you don't go on holiday, you don't see your relatives,
[3:07:14.300 --> 3:07:17.300]  your elderly relatives may be very ill,
[3:07:17.300 --> 3:07:21.300]  you don't get to see them before they die.
[3:07:21.300 --> 3:07:26.300]  Those rules don't apply to elite as I'm going to get into in the next segment.
[3:07:26.300 --> 3:07:32.300]  We've now got the UN Global Warming Climate Summit taking place in Scotland
[3:07:32.300 --> 3:07:36.300]  next November, this November coming up actually,
[3:07:36.300 --> 3:07:39.300]  and the globalists who are arriving in their private jets,
[3:07:39.300 --> 3:07:43.300]  in their commercial carbon dioxide spewing jets,
[3:07:43.300 --> 3:07:49.300]  they won't be subject to the same restrictions that British citizens are subject now.
[3:07:49.300 --> 3:07:52.300]  So I haven't seen my parents for a year,
[3:07:52.300 --> 3:07:57.300]  I can't get into Spain without having to come back and quarantine,
[3:07:57.300 --> 3:08:00.300]  and if they move Spain to the, quote, red list,
[3:08:00.300 --> 3:08:02.300]  which they've threatened to do over the past few weeks,
[3:08:02.300 --> 3:08:04.300]  if I want to go and see my parents in Spain,
[3:08:04.300 --> 3:08:07.300]  then I come back to my home country,
[3:08:07.300 --> 3:08:10.300]  I will have to quarantine, not even at home,
[3:08:10.300 --> 3:08:15.300]  but in one of these brutally run prison-like quarantine hotels
[3:08:15.300 --> 3:08:19.300]  at my own expense to the tune of $2,000,
[3:08:19.300 --> 3:08:23.300]  where you're literally allowed to go outside for a period of about 30 minutes a day
[3:08:23.300 --> 3:08:25.300]  and exercise in the yard,
[3:08:25.300 --> 3:08:30.300]  like it was San Quentin or some prison like that,
[3:08:30.300 --> 3:08:32.300]  if I haven't had the vaccine.
[3:08:32.300 --> 3:08:35.300]  Oh, by the way, these UN globalists who are arriving for a conference,
[3:08:35.300 --> 3:08:37.300]  which could have been done via Zoom,
[3:08:37.300 --> 3:08:40.300]  which is how everyone else has had to communicate with their relatives
[3:08:40.300 --> 3:08:42.300]  and work for the past 18 months,
[3:08:42.300 --> 3:08:46.300]  those people don't need the vaccine.
[3:08:46.300 --> 3:08:49.300]  Once again, one rule for them, another rule for everyone else.
[3:08:49.300 --> 3:08:51.300]  Summit.News will be back.
[3:08:51.300 --> 3:09:13.300]  I'll go away.
[3:09:22.300 --> 3:09:25.300]  We need support right now for what's going on.
[3:09:25.300 --> 3:09:27.300]  Myself, I need the cyber symposium.
[3:09:27.300 --> 3:09:30.300]  I just lost a million-dollar-week revenue by telling Fox,
[3:09:30.300 --> 3:09:33.300]  you know what, I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[3:09:33.300 --> 3:09:35.300]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[3:09:35.300 --> 3:09:37.300]  Your best special is using the promo code Alex,
[3:09:37.300 --> 3:09:40.300]  and you're supporting us getting the word out,
[3:09:40.300 --> 3:09:42.300]  with Alex's great show, Impelboros,
[3:09:42.300 --> 3:09:46.300]  and you're supporting my pillow, 2,500 employees,
[3:09:46.300 --> 3:09:48.300]  that I haven't had to lay anybody off
[3:09:48.300 --> 3:09:50.300]  in spite of trying to be an attack and cancel.
[3:09:50.300 --> 3:09:52.300]  Beautiful, you're an example of resistance.
[3:09:52.300 --> 3:10:21.300]  Thank you.
[3:10:22.300 --> 3:10:24.300]  This is the third eye.
[3:10:24.300 --> 3:10:26.300]  Also described as the seat of the soul,
[3:10:26.300 --> 3:10:28.300]  the pineal gland is what connects us
[3:10:28.300 --> 3:10:30.300]  to higher levels of consciousness
[3:10:30.300 --> 3:10:33.300]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[3:10:33.300 --> 3:10:35.300]  Fluoride-free water is essential
[3:10:35.300 --> 3:10:38.300]  to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[3:10:38.300 --> 3:10:41.300]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:44.300]  will keep your drinking water fluoride-free
[3:10:44.300 --> 3:10:47.300]  and the pro-pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[3:10:47.300 --> 3:10:50.300]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend
[3:10:50.300 --> 3:10:56.300]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:10:56.300 --> 3:11:20.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:20.300 --> 3:11:23.300]  So French people sitting at cafes outside,
[3:11:23.300 --> 3:11:26.300]  not even indoors, are being patrolled by police
[3:11:26.300 --> 3:11:30.300]  and being asked to show their COVID certification,
[3:11:30.300 --> 3:11:33.300]  their vaccine passports on their smartphones.
[3:11:33.300 --> 3:11:35.300]  Those who aren't able to show that,
[3:11:35.300 --> 3:11:37.300]  those who've tried to book the system
[3:11:37.300 --> 3:11:39.300]  are being threatened with fines
[3:11:39.300 --> 3:11:41.300]  and eventually, if they keep resisting,
[3:11:41.300 --> 3:11:45.300]  being threatened with prison sentences.
[3:11:45.300 --> 3:11:47.300]  There's another headline here on that very subject
[3:11:47.300 --> 3:11:49.300]  out of ReclaimTheNet.org.
[3:11:49.300 --> 3:11:51.300]  It says they should give as a truncheon
[3:11:51.300 --> 3:11:53.300]  and this still says French restaurant owner
[3:11:53.300 --> 3:11:56.300]  asked to enforce vaccine passports.
[3:11:56.300 --> 3:11:59.300]  So while some of the footage shows police,
[3:11:59.300 --> 3:12:01.300]  again, while literally Islamists
[3:12:01.300 --> 3:12:03.300]  and criminal refugees and illegal migrants
[3:12:03.300 --> 3:12:06.300]  are beheading, killing priests across the country
[3:12:06.300 --> 3:12:09.300]  of France, that's obviously not as important
[3:12:09.300 --> 3:12:12.300]  as making middle-class white people
[3:12:12.300 --> 3:12:15.300]  in French cafes show their vaccine passports.
[3:12:15.300 --> 3:12:17.300]  While that's happening, the restaurant owners,
[3:12:17.300 --> 3:12:19.300]  the bar owners, the cafe owners
[3:12:19.300 --> 3:12:21.300]  are saying that they can't enforce this
[3:12:21.300 --> 3:12:25.300]  because they don't have the monopoly on power to do so.
[3:12:25.300 --> 3:12:27.300]  So some restaurant staff are going as far
[3:12:27.300 --> 3:12:30.300]  as requesting weapons to be able to deal
[3:12:30.300 --> 3:12:32.300]  with angry citizens who are upset
[3:12:32.300 --> 3:12:34.300]  about their civil liberties being crushed.
[3:12:34.300 --> 3:12:36.300]  So it seems there's a disconnect,
[3:12:36.300 --> 3:12:40.300]  there's a split between the compliant sheep
[3:12:40.300 --> 3:12:42.300]  who have turned up to the cafes
[3:12:42.300 --> 3:12:45.300]  and are very willing to show their vaccine passports.
[3:12:45.300 --> 3:12:47.300]  Those who have probably even had the vaccine
[3:12:47.300 --> 3:12:49.300]  and are boycotting the cafes anyway
[3:12:49.300 --> 3:12:52.300]  because they don't want to go through this onerous procedure,
[3:12:52.300 --> 3:12:54.300]  they don't want their morning coffee
[3:12:54.300 --> 3:12:58.300]  to be interrupted by uniformed police checking their papers,
[3:12:58.300 --> 3:13:01.300]  kind of puts a crimp on your day, doesn't it?
[3:13:01.300 --> 3:13:04.300]  Especially given the fact that this relaxed cafe culture
[3:13:04.300 --> 3:13:07.300]  in places like Paris is ingrained into the French culture
[3:13:07.300 --> 3:13:10.300]  doesn't really work as a way of relaxation
[3:13:10.300 --> 3:13:14.300]  if there are police with truncheons and tasers threatening you
[3:13:14.300 --> 3:13:16.300]  if you don't have the right papers,
[3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:18.300]  maybe your smartphone doesn't work,
[3:13:18.300 --> 3:13:20.300]  maybe you can't connect to the network,
[3:13:20.300 --> 3:13:23.300]  doesn't really make for a relaxing morning coffee, does it?
[3:13:23.300 --> 3:13:26.300]  But now even the owners of these cafes
[3:13:26.300 --> 3:13:29.300]  are coming out and saying that they can't enforce this.
[3:13:29.300 --> 3:13:32.300]  Does Pascal Auban, a Parisian waiter,
[3:13:32.300 --> 3:13:34.300]  has taken orders, advised on wines
[3:13:34.300 --> 3:13:36.300]  and delivered innumerable dishes to residents
[3:13:36.300 --> 3:13:39.300]  and visitors in his 32-year career?
[3:13:39.300 --> 3:13:42.300]  But the show-be-do restaurant in Montparnasse, Paris,
[3:13:42.300 --> 3:13:44.300]  Pascal had this to say,
[3:13:44.300 --> 3:13:47.300]  quote, I'm being asked to do the job of a copper as well.
[3:13:47.300 --> 3:13:49.300]  It's crazy.
[3:13:49.300 --> 3:13:52.300]  So his consternation is not so much with the passport itself,
[3:13:52.300 --> 3:13:54.300]  but the decision that makes restaurants and their waiters
[3:13:54.300 --> 3:13:57.300]  accountable for making sure their clients have a passport.
[3:13:57.300 --> 3:13:59.300]  And basically it goes through the whole list.
[3:13:59.300 --> 3:14:03.300]  It interviews a number of cafe owners, waiters at these restaurants,
[3:14:03.300 --> 3:14:05.300]  these bars, these cafes in Paris,
[3:14:05.300 --> 3:14:08.300]  who are saying a lot of people are not happy about this.
[3:14:08.300 --> 3:14:11.300]  They don't have truncheons, they don't have pestles to enforce it,
[3:14:11.300 --> 3:14:15.300]  which is why the state comes in with the uniformed police
[3:14:15.300 --> 3:14:18.300]  to literally make people present their papers
[3:14:18.300 --> 3:14:21.300]  to drink a coffee in the morning.
[3:14:21.300 --> 3:14:24.300]  If this was predicted 18 months ago in major western cities,
[3:14:24.300 --> 3:14:26.300]  you would say that was pure bread tyranny,
[3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:32.300]  and that's exactly what's happening over the past two days in France.
[3:14:32.300 --> 3:14:35.300]  And close behind is Italy with this headline,
[3:14:35.300 --> 3:14:39.300]  Italy to extend vaccine passports to public transport and schools,
[3:14:39.300 --> 3:14:41.300]  despite massive protests against the measures,
[3:14:41.300 --> 3:14:44.300]  Italy is set to extend its vaccine passport system
[3:14:44.300 --> 3:14:47.300]  to public transport and schools from September 1.
[3:14:47.300 --> 3:14:50.300]  Potentially exacerbating growing public contempt
[3:14:50.300 --> 3:14:52.300]  towards the draconian rules,
[3:14:52.300 --> 3:14:54.300]  authorities announced that the list of venues where the passport
[3:14:54.300 --> 3:14:57.300]  would be required is to be extended.
[3:14:57.300 --> 3:15:01.300]  So teachers won't be able to work unless they get the vaccine
[3:15:01.300 --> 3:15:03.300]  and the green pass,
[3:15:03.300 --> 3:15:07.300]  which by the way they introduced in Israel a few months ago,
[3:15:07.300 --> 3:15:10.300]  and it wasn't enforced to any degree.
[3:15:10.300 --> 3:15:14.300]  Then we had the Delta variant and all these other variants,
[3:15:14.300 --> 3:15:17.300]  which now Israeli doctors and scientists are saying
[3:15:17.300 --> 3:15:22.300]  the vaccine is about 30 to 40% effective against these new variants.
[3:15:22.300 --> 3:15:24.300]  So the vaccines are failing.
[3:15:24.300 --> 3:15:26.300]  They're completely useless in many countries.
[3:15:26.300 --> 3:15:28.300]  They were further along in this window.
[3:15:28.300 --> 3:15:30.300]  So now as we had the article the other day,
[3:15:30.300 --> 3:15:32.300]  we've had Swedish professors and others saying
[3:15:32.300 --> 3:15:36.300]  that people will need to get at least five total COVID vaccines
[3:15:36.300 --> 3:15:39.300]  that could extend up to eight, nine, 10.
[3:15:39.300 --> 3:15:41.300]  Then you get to a point where people who haven't,
[3:15:41.300 --> 3:15:47.300]  whatever reason, had their five, six, seven, eight, nine booster shots
[3:15:47.300 --> 3:15:50.300]  aren't allowed to engage in basic lifestyle activities
[3:15:50.300 --> 3:15:52.300]  and depending on the country,
[3:15:52.300 --> 3:15:54.300]  how far along they are in this pandemic,
[3:15:54.300 --> 3:15:57.300]  that's starting to happen.
[3:15:57.300 --> 3:16:00.300]  Literal booster shots every six months
[3:16:00.300 --> 3:16:04.300]  for you to enjoy a coffee in an outside cafe.
[3:16:04.300 --> 3:16:08.300]  Italy has said that they're going to extend it to schools,
[3:16:08.300 --> 3:16:10.300]  universities, so you won't be able to get an education
[3:16:10.300 --> 3:16:12.300]  if you don't have the vaccine.
[3:16:12.300 --> 3:16:14.300]  But again, it's not mandatory.
[3:16:14.300 --> 3:16:17.300]  You just won't be able to have a coffee, an education,
[3:16:17.300 --> 3:16:20.300]  go on holiday, see your parents, have a wedding,
[3:16:20.300 --> 3:16:23.300]  but it's not mandatory, okay?
[3:16:23.300 --> 3:16:27.300]  Customers and venues may face fines ranging from 400 euros
[3:16:27.300 --> 3:16:33.300]  to 1,000 euros if businesses fail to implement the regulation.
[3:16:33.300 --> 3:16:35.300]  Institutions that frequently break the rules,
[3:16:35.300 --> 3:16:37.300]  risk being shut down for up to 10 days
[3:16:37.300 --> 3:16:41.300]  and of course, after 10 days, it will be for good.
[3:16:41.300 --> 3:16:44.300]  But don't worry because Health Minister Roberto Sperana
[3:16:44.300 --> 3:16:47.300]  said the extension of the scheme to include schools
[3:16:47.300 --> 3:16:49.300]  and public transport was necessary to, quote,
[3:16:49.300 --> 3:16:52.300]  avoid closures and to safeguard freedom.
[3:16:52.300 --> 3:16:55.300]  Yes, having a mandatory government shot for the privilege
[3:16:55.300 --> 3:16:58.300]  of enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning
[3:16:58.300 --> 3:17:01.300]  is part of your freedom.
[3:17:01.300 --> 3:17:05.300]  How more Orwellian can you get than that?
[3:17:05.300 --> 3:17:07.300]  Good news, though, over in Switzerland
[3:17:07.300 --> 3:17:09.300]  where we have this headline,
[3:17:09.300 --> 3:17:11.300]  Swiss police threatened to stop enforcing
[3:17:11.300 --> 3:17:14.300]  COVID-19 rules altogether.
[3:17:14.300 --> 3:17:17.300]  Police in Switzerland have threatened to stop enforcing
[3:17:17.300 --> 3:17:19.300]  COVID-19 rules over fears that the measures
[3:17:19.300 --> 3:17:21.300]  are disproportionately undermining
[3:17:21.300 --> 3:17:23.300]  the fundamental rights of citizens.
[3:17:23.300 --> 3:17:27.300]  This was a letter sent by a group of police officers
[3:17:27.300 --> 3:17:29.300]  to the Swiss Federation of Police Officers
[3:17:29.300 --> 3:17:32.300]  warning of potential insubordination
[3:17:32.300 --> 3:17:35.300]  within the force over the enforcement of draconian laws.
[3:17:35.300 --> 3:17:37.300]  So there is some resistance,
[3:17:37.300 --> 3:17:40.300]  even within the police force in Switzerland.
[3:17:40.300 --> 3:17:42.300]  That's great news.
[3:17:42.300 --> 3:17:44.300]  But I mentioned this before the break.
[3:17:44.300 --> 3:17:47.300]  UN globalists arriving in UK for climate summit
[3:17:47.300 --> 3:17:52.300]  won't face COVID restrictions imposed on British citizens.
[3:17:52.300 --> 3:17:54.300]  So Brits who travel abroad
[3:17:54.300 --> 3:17:57.300]  and then come back to their own country as residents,
[3:17:57.300 --> 3:18:01.300]  as citizens have to play a lottery basically
[3:18:01.300 --> 3:18:03.300]  with this system that the government set up
[3:18:03.300 --> 3:18:08.300]  of green, amber, amber plus and red list countries
[3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:10.300]  where depending on the country
[3:18:10.300 --> 3:18:12.300]  and they can move the gold post at any time,
[3:18:12.300 --> 3:18:14.300]  even if they're still abroad enjoying
[3:18:14.300 --> 3:18:16.300]  or trying to enjoy their holiday,
[3:18:16.300 --> 3:18:18.300]  they don't even know when they come back
[3:18:18.300 --> 3:18:20.300]  what they'll be forced to do.
[3:18:20.300 --> 3:18:22.300]  If countries are on the red list,
[3:18:22.300 --> 3:18:24.300]  they literally have to at their own expense
[3:18:24.300 --> 3:18:29.300]  to the tune of about $2,000 self isolate quarantine
[3:18:29.300 --> 3:18:32.300]  within these prison like hotels
[3:18:32.300 --> 3:18:34.300]  that are enforced by brutal conditions,
[3:18:34.300 --> 3:18:39.300]  horrible rotting food, basically prison guards
[3:18:39.300 --> 3:18:41.300]  that are allowed outside of this hotel
[3:18:41.300 --> 3:18:43.300]  in a designated area near an airport
[3:18:43.300 --> 3:18:46.300]  to exercise to get some fresh air for about an hour.
[3:18:46.300 --> 3:18:48.300]  It's literally prison conditions
[3:18:48.300 --> 3:18:51.300]  if they come back from a red list.
[3:18:51.300 --> 3:18:54.300]  If they come back from an amber list country,
[3:18:54.300 --> 3:18:57.300]  and again, these countries are changing all the time,
[3:18:57.300 --> 3:19:00.300]  they have to self isolate at home.
[3:19:00.300 --> 3:19:02.300]  They get visits from the local authorities,
[3:19:02.300 --> 3:19:04.300]  from police officers.
[3:19:04.300 --> 3:19:06.300]  We had a story last week of a 12 year old girl
[3:19:06.300 --> 3:19:08.300]  being traumatized after multiple visits
[3:19:08.300 --> 3:19:10.300]  from a police officer at her home.
[3:19:10.300 --> 3:19:13.300]  You know the people who don't have to abide by these rules?
[3:19:13.300 --> 3:19:16.300]  The globalists, the elite were visiting
[3:19:16.300 --> 3:19:18.300]  while traveling over by the way
[3:19:18.300 --> 3:19:21.300]  CO2 belching private planes and commercial jets,
[3:19:21.300 --> 3:19:23.300]  visiting Scotland for this
[3:19:23.300 --> 3:19:26.300]  UN climate change conference in November.
[3:19:26.300 --> 3:19:28.300]  Those who have had the vaccine
[3:19:28.300 --> 3:19:30.300]  don't need to do anything whatsoever.
[3:19:30.300 --> 3:19:32.300]  Even those who haven't had the vaccine,
[3:19:32.300 --> 3:19:34.300]  the red list countries,
[3:19:34.300 --> 3:19:37.300]  their quarantine period is cut in half.
[3:19:37.300 --> 3:19:39.300]  The amber list attendees
[3:19:39.300 --> 3:19:41.300]  who are coming from amber list countries,
[3:19:41.300 --> 3:19:44.300]  they don't have to isolate at all.
[3:19:44.300 --> 3:19:46.300]  So it's one rule for them,
[3:19:46.300 --> 3:19:48.300]  one rule for British citizens
[3:19:48.300 --> 3:19:50.300]  in our own country.
[3:19:50.300 --> 3:19:52.300]  We'll be back with more summit.news.
[3:19:52.300 --> 3:20:17.300]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me,
[3:20:17.300 --> 3:20:23.300]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed
[3:20:23.300 --> 3:20:25.300]  and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:25.300 --> 3:20:27.300]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:20:27.300 --> 3:20:30.300]  And as this whole new world order comes out and be open,
[3:20:30.300 --> 3:20:32.300]  our credibility is going up.
[3:20:32.300 --> 3:20:34.300]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:34.300 --> 3:20:36.300]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:36.300 --> 3:20:38.300]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved
[3:20:38.300 --> 3:20:40.300]  and America still quasi free.
[3:20:40.300 --> 3:20:42.300]  You can't have info wars has been proven right
[3:20:42.300 --> 3:20:45.300]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:45.300 --> 3:20:47.300]  And get an infowarstore.com
[3:20:47.300 --> 3:20:49.300]  Get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:20:49.300 --> 3:20:51.300]  supplements and so much more.
[3:20:51.300 --> 3:21:20.300]  Let's see how they support the infowar. Thank you.
[3:21:21.300 --> 3:21:23.300]  We're going to talk a little bit about HIV and the mistreatment of it
[3:21:23.300 --> 3:21:26.300]  with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[3:21:26.300 --> 3:21:30.300]  than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[3:21:30.300 --> 3:21:33.300]  that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body
[3:21:33.300 --> 3:21:35.300]  and create autoimmune disorders.
[3:21:35.300 --> 3:21:39.300]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down
[3:21:39.300 --> 3:21:42.300]  and would be non-lethal down the road.
[3:21:42.300 --> 3:21:45.300]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[3:21:45.300 --> 3:21:48.300]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[3:21:48.300 --> 3:21:51.300]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[3:21:51.300 --> 3:22:20.300]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[3:22:51.300 --> 3:22:53.300]  Thank you for some off right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:21.300 --> 3:23:30.300]  I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox,
[3:23:30.300 --> 3:23:33.300]  you know what, I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[3:23:33.300 --> 3:23:35.300]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[3:23:35.300 --> 3:23:37.300]  Your best special is using the promo code Alex
[3:23:37.300 --> 3:23:40.300]  and you're supporting us getting the word out
[3:23:40.300 --> 3:23:45.300]  with Alex's great show, infowar and you're supporting my pillow,
[3:23:45.300 --> 3:23:51.300]  2,500 employees and I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack.
[3:23:51.300 --> 3:23:56.300]  Beautiful, you're an example of resistance, Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[3:23:56.300 --> 3:24:06.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:06.300 --> 3:24:16.300]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:24:16.300 --> 3:24:18.300]  So we've seen this before with the Euros
[3:24:18.300 --> 3:24:24.300]  where they allow special dispensation for the Euro soccer officials to come into the UK,
[3:24:24.300 --> 3:24:29.300]  enjoy relaxed rules that are not applied to British citizens.
[3:24:29.300 --> 3:24:32.300]  They have to jump through 50 flaming hoops to be able to go on holiday
[3:24:32.300 --> 3:24:38.300]  and when they come back from holiday, in many cases, they have to face brutal prison-like conditions
[3:24:38.300 --> 3:24:40.300]  in these quarantine hotels.
[3:24:40.300 --> 3:24:42.300]  If not, they have to quarantine at home.
[3:24:42.300 --> 3:24:45.300]  They have to get checked up on by police, local authorities.
[3:24:45.300 --> 3:24:50.300]  But if you're a globalist, even coming from a, quote, red list country,
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:24:54.300]  which they claim is riddled by coronavirus infections from Africa,
[3:24:54.300 --> 3:24:58.300]  from Latin America, from these other areas of the world,
[3:24:58.300 --> 3:24:59.300]  they can just get away with it.
[3:24:59.300 --> 3:25:02.300]  From the amber list countries, they don't have to do anything.
[3:25:02.300 --> 3:25:05.300]  They don't even have to be vaccinated to come into the country.
[3:25:05.300 --> 3:25:08.300]  Even if they're on these red list countries, as I said,
[3:25:08.300 --> 3:25:15.300]  their quarantine period is cut in half compared to British citizens who live here
[3:25:15.300 --> 3:25:19.300]  who are just trying to have the first holiday they've had in over a year with their families.
[3:25:19.300 --> 3:25:20.300]  They come back.
[3:25:20.300 --> 3:25:22.300]  They're treated like crap.
[3:25:22.300 --> 3:25:25.300]  They're treated like walking biological time bombs.
[3:25:25.300 --> 3:25:29.300]  Oh, but if you're a UN globalist spewing climate change alarmism,
[3:25:29.300 --> 3:25:31.300]  then you get kid gloves treatment.
[3:25:31.300 --> 3:25:35.300]  You get special treatment because you are part of the club.
[3:25:35.300 --> 3:25:41.300]  The article says the 10-day quarantine applies even if the individual is vaccinated.
[3:25:41.300 --> 3:25:43.300]  This is talking about UK citizens.
[3:25:43.300 --> 3:25:47.300]  While those returning from amber countries have to perform the same self-isolation at home,
[3:25:47.300 --> 3:25:50.300]  again with local authorities and police routinely checking up on them.
[3:25:50.300 --> 3:25:56.300]  However, the same rules won't apply to globalist environmentalist alarmist visiting Scotland,
[3:25:56.300 --> 3:25:59.300]  the United Nations Climate Change Conference in November.
[3:25:59.300 --> 3:26:02.300]  They couldn't have the conference over Zoom,
[3:26:02.300 --> 3:26:07.300]  even though Scotland has even more onerous coronavirus restrictions than England.
[3:26:07.300 --> 3:26:14.300]  No, they have to be around a table because just like the hundreds of thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters
[3:26:14.300 --> 3:26:20.300]  who gathered in giant crowds at the very high of the pandemic during the first lockdown,
[3:26:20.300 --> 3:26:28.300]  just like systemic racism, climate change alarmism is even more important than this pandemic
[3:26:28.300 --> 3:26:32.300]  that they say we need to fundamentally change and alter our lives over.
[3:26:32.300 --> 3:26:41.300]  But again, not so much for them because the rules imposed on them are significantly less onerous than the rules imposed on us.
[3:26:41.300 --> 3:26:44.300]  The UK government said in a statement,
[3:26:44.300 --> 3:26:50.300]  there'll be no requirement for self-isolation on arrival to the UK for those coming from amber or greenless countries,
[3:26:50.300 --> 3:26:52.300]  whether vaccinated or not.
[3:26:52.300 --> 3:26:53.300]  They don't care.
[3:26:53.300 --> 3:26:54.300]  They're in the special class.
[3:26:54.300 --> 3:26:58.300]  They're in the Martha's Vineyard Obama party class.
[3:26:58.300 --> 3:27:03.300]  They don't need to abide by the same rules that we are all subjected to.
[3:27:03.300 --> 3:27:10.300]  In addition, those arriving from deadly red list countries that Brits have been told to avoid like the plague.
[3:27:10.300 --> 3:27:18.300]  Remember, if you don't follow through with this self-isolation when you come back from a red list country in the United Kingdom,
[3:27:18.300 --> 3:27:25.300]  you'll be subject to a fine of up to 10,000 pounds and put in prison for up to 10 years
[3:27:25.300 --> 3:27:29.300]  if you come back from a red list country and you don't self-isolate.
[3:27:29.300 --> 3:27:33.300]  Oh, but these globalists, these UN climate change alarmists,
[3:27:33.300 --> 3:27:40.300]  they can only quarantine, they only have to quarantine for a period of five days and I'm sure that it's in much comfier surroundings
[3:27:40.300 --> 3:27:45.300]  than a prison-like hotel patrolled by aggressive security guards.
[3:27:45.300 --> 3:27:49.300]  I'm sure they're not getting fed rotten food for 10 days,
[3:27:49.300 --> 3:27:54.300]  like Brits are who have to return from these, quote, red list countries.
[3:27:54.300 --> 3:27:59.300]  Again, the government justified the double standard by basically arguing that climate change is an important issue,
[3:27:59.300 --> 3:28:04.300]  just as Black Lives Matter protesters were allowed to gather in their thousands for the height of the pandemic,
[3:28:04.300 --> 3:28:11.300]  presumably because systemic racism was more of a threat than COVID-19.
[3:28:11.300 --> 3:28:16.300]  And again, we saw this before with the G7 summit in Cornwall back a couple of months ago,
[3:28:16.300 --> 3:28:22.300]  where pictures were released of world leaders, masclists in close proximity to each other, touching one another.
[3:28:22.300 --> 3:28:28.300]  You remember that Macron was basically French kissing Biden at one point.
[3:28:28.300 --> 3:28:32.300]  In conservation of the then rules demanding social distancing and face coverings,
[3:28:32.300 --> 3:28:37.300]  and then of course we saw the staged photo ops where they were socially distanced,
[3:28:37.300 --> 3:28:45.300]  then you saw the massive barbecue party where they followed zero of those social distancing rules whatsoever.
[3:28:45.300 --> 3:28:49.300]  So they've done it before, they're about to do it again in November,
[3:28:49.300 --> 3:28:55.300]  and yet we're still treated like walking biological plague bombs in our own country,
[3:28:55.300 --> 3:28:58.300]  because we're not part of the elite.
[3:28:58.300 --> 3:28:59.300]  Let's go to this video now.
[3:28:59.300 --> 3:29:03.300]  Rand Paul calls for resistance to COVID, a tyranny.
[3:29:03.300 --> 3:29:09.300]  This is a perfect encapsulation of everything that we're facing and everything that we need to rebel against,
[3:29:09.300 --> 3:29:13.300]  and we'll come up with more news, but here is Rand Paul. Let's roll it.
[3:29:13.300 --> 3:29:15.300]  It's time for us to resist.
[3:29:15.300 --> 3:29:17.300]  They can't arrest all of us.
[3:29:17.300 --> 3:29:20.300]  They can't keep all of your kids home from school.
[3:29:20.300 --> 3:29:23.300]  They can't keep every government building closed,
[3:29:23.300 --> 3:29:28.300]  although I've got a long list of ones they might keep closed or might ought to keep closed.
[3:29:28.300 --> 3:29:35.300]  We don't have to accept the mandates, lockdowns, and harmful policies of the petty tyrants and bureaucrats.
[3:29:35.300 --> 3:29:38.300]  We can simply say no, not again.
[3:29:38.300 --> 3:29:44.300]  Nancy Pelosi, you will not arrest or stop me or anyone on my staff from doing our jobs.
[3:29:44.300 --> 3:29:49.300]  We have either had COVID, had the vaccine, or been offered the vaccine.
[3:29:49.300 --> 3:29:53.300]  We will make our own health choices. We will not show you a passport.
[3:29:53.300 --> 3:29:55.300]  We will not wear a mask.
[3:29:55.300 --> 3:30:02.300]  We will not be forced into random screenings and testings so you can continue your drunk with power, rain over the Capitol.
[3:30:02.300 --> 3:30:09.300]  President Biden, we will not accept your agency's mandates or your reported moves towards a lockdown.
[3:30:09.300 --> 3:30:14.300]  No one should follow the CDC's anti-science mask mandates.
[3:30:14.300 --> 3:30:19.300]  And if you want to shut down federal agencies again, some of which aren't even back to work yet,
[3:30:19.300 --> 3:30:27.300]  I will stop every bill coming through the Senate with an amendment to cut their funding if they don't come back to work in person.
[3:30:27.300 --> 3:30:34.300]  Local bureaucrats and union bosses, we will not allow you to do more harm to our children again this year.
[3:30:34.300 --> 3:30:39.300]  Children are not at any more risk from COVID than they are from the seasonal flu.
[3:30:39.300 --> 3:30:45.300]  Every adult who works in schools has either had the vaccine or had their chance to get vaccinated.
[3:30:45.300 --> 3:30:51.300]  There is no reason for mask mandates, part-time schools, or any lockdown measures.
[3:30:51.300 --> 3:31:01.300]  Children are falling behind in school and are being harmed physically and psychologically by the tactics that you have used to keep them from the classroom during the last year.
[3:31:01.300 --> 3:31:03.300]  We won't allow it again.
[3:31:03.300 --> 3:31:10.300]  The school system attempts to keep children from full-time in-person school. I will hold up every bill with two amendments,
[3:31:10.300 --> 3:31:17.300]  one to defund them and another to allow parents the choice of where the money goes for their child's education.
[3:31:17.300 --> 3:31:21.300]  Do I sound fed up to you? That's because I am.
[3:31:21.300 --> 3:31:25.300]  I'm not a career politician. I've practiced medicine for 33 years.
[3:31:25.300 --> 3:31:29.300]  I graduated from Duke Medical School. I've worked in emergency rooms.
[3:31:29.300 --> 3:31:34.300]  I've studied immunology and virology, and I ultimately chose to become an eye surgeon.
[3:31:34.300 --> 3:31:43.300]  I have been telling everyone for a year now that Dr. Fauci and other public health bureaucrats were not following the science,
[3:31:43.300 --> 3:31:46.300]  and I've been proven right time and time again.
[3:31:46.300 --> 3:31:49.300]  But I'm not the only one who is fed up.
[3:31:49.300 --> 3:31:53.300]  I can't go anywhere these days without people coming up and thanking me for standing up for them,
[3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:59.300]  whether I'm at work or at events in Kentucky, at airports, in restaurants or in stores.
[3:31:59.300 --> 3:32:01.300]  People thank me for taking a stand.
[3:32:01.300 --> 3:32:06.300]  They thank me for standing up for actual science, for standing up for freedom,
[3:32:06.300 --> 3:32:11.300]  for standing against mandates, lockdowns, and bureaucratic power grabs.
[3:32:11.300 --> 3:32:16.300]  I think the tide is turning as more and more people are willing to stand up.
[3:32:16.300 --> 3:32:21.300]  I see stories from across the country of parents standing up to the unions and school boards.
[3:32:21.300 --> 3:32:27.300]  I see brave moms standing up and saying, my kids need to go back to school in person.
[3:32:27.300 --> 3:32:32.300]  I see members of Congress refusing to comply with petty tyrant Pelosi.
[3:32:32.300 --> 3:32:35.300]  We are at a moment of truth and a crossroads.
[3:32:35.300 --> 3:32:43.300]  Will we allow these people to use fear and propaganda to do further harm to our society, economy, and children?
[3:32:43.300 --> 3:32:47.300]  Or will we stand together and say, absolutely not.
[3:32:47.300 --> 3:32:52.300]  Not this time, I choose freedom.
[3:32:52.300 --> 3:32:56.300]  Powerful speech there from Senator Rand Paul.
[3:32:56.300 --> 3:33:01.300]  Meanwhile, the people that are still trying to keep us under lockdown and indeed fetishizing lockdown,
[3:33:01.300 --> 3:33:05.300]  like victims of Stockholm syndrome or journalists and the media.
[3:33:05.300 --> 3:33:09.300]  We had this headline yesterday and there have been similar ones before.
[3:33:09.300 --> 3:33:13.300]  Journalists says, I'm going to miss being locked down.
[3:33:13.300 --> 3:33:20.300]  Pines for another journalist, Michael Bernatullo Manitavani wrote an article for The Guardian
[3:33:20.300 --> 3:33:23.300]  in which he said, I'm going to miss being locked down while pining for another.
[3:33:23.300 --> 3:33:26.300]  Basically, he's lazy, doesn't want to get out of bed.
[3:33:26.300 --> 3:33:30.300]  He wants to get paid government furlough to sit on his arse all day.
[3:33:30.300 --> 3:33:36.300]  And he thinks that everybody else should pine for the same despite the fact that people have missed the funerals of their relatives,
[3:33:36.300 --> 3:33:41.300]  people have lost their businesses, people have become chronically depressed, people have killed themselves,
[3:33:41.300 --> 3:33:43.300]  the economy is going to crap.
[3:33:43.300 --> 3:33:49.300]  But this guy gets to sit in his pajamas all day whilst viewing crappy articles for The Guardian like this.
[3:33:49.300 --> 3:33:51.300]  So he wants another lockdown. We'll be back.
[3:33:51.300 --> 3:33:52.300]  Don't go away.
[3:33:52.300 --> 3:33:56.300]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[3:33:56.300 --> 3:33:58.300]  And I just want to say something.
[3:33:58.300 --> 3:34:02.300]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[3:34:02.300 --> 3:34:07.300]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[3:34:07.300 --> 3:34:13.300]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black,
[3:34:13.300 --> 3:34:15.300]  it doesn't matter you got red blood.
[3:34:15.300 --> 3:34:21.300]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[3:34:21.300 --> 3:34:25.300]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:34:25.300 --> 3:34:29.300]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[3:34:29.300 --> 3:34:32.300]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:34:32.300 --> 3:34:37.300]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:34:37.300 --> 3:34:40.300]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:34:40.300 --> 3:34:44.300]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:34:44.300 --> 3:34:48.300]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[3:34:48.300 --> 3:35:03.300]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[3:35:18.300 --> 3:35:24.300]  Before you will again take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks out that wants to put in your body.
[3:35:24.300 --> 3:35:29.300]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[3:35:29.300 --> 3:35:34.300]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:39.300]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler,
[3:35:39.300 --> 3:35:44.300]  and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany.
[3:35:44.300 --> 3:35:48.300]  And of course, we'll continue to selflessly fight this. I don't know how long we can.
[3:35:48.300 --> 3:36:15.300]  For us all now, God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[3:36:18.300 --> 3:36:21.300]  This is a great design to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:36:21.300 --> 3:36:25.300]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:36:25.300 --> 3:36:36.300]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:36:36.300 --> 3:36:41.300]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[3:36:41.300 --> 3:36:47.300]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system. That's thebiopros.com.
[3:36:47.300 --> 3:36:51.300]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[3:37:18.300 --> 3:37:26.300]  As low as $49.99 a set, I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[3:37:26.300 --> 3:37:32.300]  Myself, I need the cyber symposium. I just lost a million dollar week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[3:37:32.300 --> 3:37:36.300]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture. We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[3:37:36.300 --> 3:37:48.300]  Our best special is using the promo code ALEKS and you're supporting us getting the word out with ALEKS' great show and your supporting my pillow, 2,500 employees.
[3:37:48.300 --> 3:37:51.300]  And I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attacked and camp...
[3:37:51.300 --> 3:37:54.300]  Beautiful. You're an example of resistance. Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[3:37:54.300 --> 3:38:04.300]  You're listening to the ALEKS Jones show.
[3:38:07.300 --> 3:38:15.300]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:38:15.300 --> 3:38:30.300]  So the UN came out with another alarmist apocalyptic global warming warning, a code red for humanity yesterday, basically saying that while they're going to continue flying private jets to these global climate conferences,
[3:38:30.300 --> 3:38:38.300]  while John Kerry's going to keep taking his private jet to attend Barack Obama's birthday parties in Martha's vineyard,
[3:38:38.300 --> 3:38:45.300]  you're going to have to drastically reduce your energy use. You're going to drastically have to reduce your travel, your entire way of living.
[3:38:45.300 --> 3:38:55.300]  Your economy is going to go to pot. The employment rates, as we saw in Spain with their completely failed green economy, are going to soar to 25% plus.
[3:38:55.300 --> 3:39:04.300]  But it's all to save the planet, so it's all worth it. Just they're not going to have to abide by the same economy stripping lifestyle,
[3:39:04.300 --> 3:39:11.300]  ruining measures that you will have to abide by because they're the elite and the same rules don't apply to them.
[3:39:11.300 --> 3:39:14.300]  We have this headline out of Summit.News again.
[3:39:14.300 --> 3:39:18.300]  UN climate report author says people are starting to get scared.
[3:39:18.300 --> 3:39:27.300]  He betrayed the truth behind this report in this little comment here, and this will change the way they quote, vote.
[3:39:27.300 --> 3:39:34.300]  And by the way, I went on BBC News website last night, and you can see this in the tweet, which is in the article.
[3:39:34.300 --> 3:39:40.300]  They have or had last night at the top of their entire news website. Let's count them.
[3:39:40.300 --> 3:39:48.300]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 news stories all above the fold at the top of the website.
[3:39:48.300 --> 3:39:53.300]  Every single news story about this UN climate report.
[3:39:53.300 --> 3:39:59.300]  That's not news. That's propaganda. That's aggressively pushing a narrative.
[3:39:59.300 --> 3:40:02.300]  It's kind of a big cope in a way. It's trying too hard.
[3:40:02.300 --> 3:40:07.300]  They would have 10 news stories filling the entire top bracket of their website,
[3:40:07.300 --> 3:40:15.300]  trying to convince people of this absolutely alarmist bollocks that they come out with every three or four years.
[3:40:15.300 --> 3:40:22.300]  The same people who told us that global cooling would cause ecological devastation back in the 70s.
[3:40:22.300 --> 3:40:27.300]  The very same people, by the way, who are still authors of these new IPCC UN climate reports.
[3:40:27.300 --> 3:40:32.300]  The same people who said the North Pole would be ice free by 2013.
[3:40:32.300 --> 3:40:37.300]  In fact, from 2013 to 2014, it had record ice growth.
[3:40:37.300 --> 3:40:43.300]  The same people who said that the population bomb would lead to mass famine throughout the world,
[3:40:43.300 --> 3:40:46.300]  throughout the 80s and 90s, Paul Ehrlich.
[3:40:46.300 --> 3:40:52.300]  All the same people now telling us the same crap that if we don't sign over sovereign power,
[3:40:52.300 --> 3:40:56.300]  that if we don't sign over all our freedoms, we've talked about climate lockdowns,
[3:40:56.300 --> 3:41:04.300]  the World Economic Forum, to the globalists, to the United Nations, to the WEF, to Davos Man,
[3:41:04.300 --> 3:41:07.300]  then the world is going to hell in a handbasket.
[3:41:07.300 --> 3:41:13.300]  Despite the fact that climate deaths, deaths of people responsible for the climate,
[3:41:13.300 --> 3:41:20.300]  in terms of floods, droughts, wildfires, whatever have declined by about 95% over the past 50 years.
[3:41:20.300 --> 3:41:24.300]  In terms of the fact that extreme weather events are actually down on previous decades,
[3:41:24.300 --> 3:41:28.300]  now it doesn't matter, because they came out with a scary report
[3:41:28.300 --> 3:41:34.300]  and the BBC News needed 10 headlines at the top of their website to convince you of it.
[3:41:34.300 --> 3:41:41.300]  Because it's so convincing, they literally need to put 10 frigging headlines at the top of their news website.
[3:41:41.300 --> 3:41:45.300]  It sounds like a big cope to me.
[3:41:45.300 --> 3:41:52.300]  Well now, the true agenda behind the fear mongering was betrayed by one of the authors of the report, Jim Cossin,
[3:41:52.300 --> 3:41:55.300]  who helped write one of the chapters on extremes.
[3:41:55.300 --> 3:41:59.300]  He says, quote, I think more and more people are starting to get scared,
[3:41:59.300 --> 3:42:05.300]  adding I think that'll help to change people's attitudes and hope that'll affect the way they vote.
[3:42:05.300 --> 3:42:08.300]  So he's literally admitting this is working, they're scaring people,
[3:42:08.300 --> 3:42:13.300]  going to change the way they vote, so they vote in more left-wing parties to give the United Nations
[3:42:13.300 --> 3:42:16.300]  more power to take their rights.
[3:42:16.300 --> 3:42:20.300]  We've got a clip now from Mark Murano, who appeared on Fox News,
[3:42:20.300 --> 3:42:27.300]  perfectly explaining the alarmism, the hysteria that the United Nations trots out every three to four years.
[3:42:27.300 --> 3:42:31.300]  We'll come back and talk about it after, but here is that clip.
[3:42:31.300 --> 3:42:38.300]  29 minutes down before the top of the hour, you and scientists raising an alarm on climate change in a 3,000 page report
[3:42:38.300 --> 3:42:42.300]  calling global warming, quote, a code red for humanity.
[3:42:42.300 --> 3:42:47.300]  And the media jumping on board wanting to get scared, proclaiming the report revealed alarming findings.
[3:42:47.300 --> 3:42:52.300]  But before you start to worry about the end of the world, our next guest is here with a reality check,
[3:42:52.300 --> 3:42:55.300]  the publisher of climatedepot.com, Mark Murano.
[3:42:55.300 --> 3:43:00.300]  Mark, what was your takeaway?
[3:43:00.300 --> 3:43:03.300]  My takeaway, this is what the UN does every three to five years.
[3:43:03.300 --> 3:43:06.300]  And it's essentially, you don't have to trust the science.
[3:43:06.300 --> 3:43:09.300]  They're asking you to trust scientific institutions.
[3:43:09.300 --> 3:43:15.300]  And this is a political lobbying arm of the United Nations that pretends to be a science panel.
[3:43:15.300 --> 3:43:17.300]  They were started in 1988.
[3:43:17.300 --> 3:43:21.300]  Their goal is to scare everyone to convince you into, quote, climate action.
[3:43:21.300 --> 3:43:25.300]  Al Gore has said these reports are, quote, torqued up.
[3:43:25.300 --> 3:43:27.300]  How else do you get the attention of policymakers?
[3:43:27.300 --> 3:43:33.300]  One of the lead authors of this report actually says he hopes it impacts the way people vote.
[3:43:33.300 --> 3:43:37.300]  And this is a guy in charge of one of the authors who's a climate risk specialist
[3:43:37.300 --> 3:43:40.300]  who actually potentially financially benefits off the report.
[3:43:40.300 --> 3:43:47.300]  So this is a report using a climate scare to get people to support UN treaties, green new deals.
[3:43:47.300 --> 3:43:50.300]  So right off the bat, you have to be suspect of what it claims.
[3:43:50.300 --> 3:43:55.300]  And Al Gore, of course, made zillions of dollars off climate change in his global warming.
[3:43:55.300 --> 3:44:00.300]  And he also, most of the stuff that he predicted, none of it has come true so far.
[3:44:00.300 --> 3:44:02.300]  Let's look at some of the highlights of the report.
[3:44:02.300 --> 3:44:04.300]  Blaming humans for the rising temperatures.
[3:44:04.300 --> 3:44:06.300]  They say it's all about the combustion engine.
[3:44:06.300 --> 3:44:11.300]  Concludes will surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold,
[3:44:11.300 --> 3:44:15.300]  which the Paris Climate Agreement is trying to limit earlier.
[3:44:15.300 --> 3:44:20.300]  And words the ice melt and sea level rises are accelerating, predicts extreme weather will get worse.
[3:44:20.300 --> 3:44:24.300]  Out of those, when people see the floods, when they see what happened in Europe,
[3:44:24.300 --> 3:44:31.300]  when they see that what's happening outside President Obama's place in Narragansett,
[3:44:31.300 --> 3:44:36.300]  Martha's Vineyard, when they see erosion, they think climate change.
[3:44:36.300 --> 3:44:39.300]  Do you?
[3:44:39.300 --> 3:44:40.300]  No. And here's why.
[3:44:40.300 --> 3:44:44.300]  Even the UN has to admit, you saw some of the key words you had up on the screen there, Brian,
[3:44:44.300 --> 3:44:46.300]  were will do this.
[3:44:46.300 --> 3:44:51.300]  They have a projection that when current reality fails to alarm, they make scary predictions of the future.
[3:44:51.300 --> 3:44:57.300]  For instance, they claim in the data now that the heat waves have increased and extreme precipitation.
[3:44:57.300 --> 3:45:03.300]  Well, but on the flip side, they claim that global floods are not increasing, droughts are not increasing,
[3:45:03.300 --> 3:45:06.300]  hurricanes are not increasing, tornadoes are not increasing.
[3:45:06.300 --> 3:45:12.300]  So currently, the bulk of what they're claiming is not increasing, so they project it into the future.
[3:45:12.300 --> 3:45:18.300]  And interestingly enough, they claim that CO2 is at millions of years high and that the temperatures are unprecedented.
[3:45:18.300 --> 3:45:23.300]  The medieval and Roman warming period of about, you know, medieval warming period of about 1200
[3:45:23.300 --> 3:45:27.300]  and the Roman warming period of about zero had as warm or warmer temperatures.
[3:45:27.300 --> 3:45:33.300]  90% of the Earth's geologic history has had higher CO2 levels and higher temperatures than current.
[3:45:33.300 --> 3:45:37.300]  In other words, 90% of Earth's history was too warm to have ice to either pole.
[3:45:37.300 --> 3:45:41.300]  So what they're doing here is trying to act as though humanity is unprecedented.
[3:45:41.300 --> 3:45:48.300]  There are Nobel Prize-winning scientists, former UN scientists who've turned against this report and against this whole process
[3:45:48.300 --> 3:45:55.300]  because they've politicized it, they've turned science into lobbying, and there's nothing to alarm the American public.
[3:45:55.300 --> 3:45:59.300]  In fact, the climate death rate over 100 years has declined 95% plus.
[3:45:59.300 --> 3:46:03.300]  In other words, our fossil fuel use has protected us.
[3:46:03.300 --> 3:46:10.300]  It's taken an unsafe climate and made it safe, and the UN claims we need to make ourselves poorer to make us handle a climate better.
[3:46:10.300 --> 3:46:17.300]  And we're about to take our economy and destroy it because, according to Chuck Schumer, by taking the 3.5 trillion,
[3:46:17.300 --> 3:46:20.300]  we're about to get shoved down our throats without any bipartisan support.
[3:46:20.300 --> 3:46:27.300]  Climate change, we will have climate change to save our planet and will affect global warming.
[3:46:27.300 --> 3:46:33.300]  So if we can pass everything in 3.5 trillion, the Earth will be a better place, according to Democrats.
[3:46:33.300 --> 3:46:36.300]  Mark, unfortunately we have to leave it there.
[3:46:36.300 --> 3:46:41.300]  We're literally saying, pay up or the climate will get you. That's the message, that's what they're claiming.
[3:46:41.300 --> 3:46:45.300]  Pay up or if you don't pay up, we can't protect you from the climate.
[3:46:45.300 --> 3:46:50.300]  Exactly, although we're out of money, but let's not get bogged down in that. Mark, thank you.
[3:46:50.300 --> 3:46:52.300]  Exactly.
[3:46:52.300 --> 3:46:57.300]  Meanwhile, Breibor reports angry at Western civilization not dismantling itself fast enough.
[3:46:57.300 --> 3:47:01.300]  Ecoactivists will protest indefinitely this is extinction rebellion,
[3:47:01.300 --> 3:47:07.300]  who meanwhile, the government is literally fulfilling their every demand by pursuing this Paris climate treaty,
[3:47:07.300 --> 3:47:11.300]  by amplifying, legitimizing this UN Global Climate Report.
[3:47:11.300 --> 3:47:14.300]  They're claiming that they're doing nothing. They're actually part of the establishment.
[3:47:14.300 --> 3:47:18.300]  The establishment is fulfilling their every goal, their every need.
[3:47:18.300 --> 3:47:22.300]  They're going to occupy the streets of London for the next two weeks, once again,
[3:47:22.300 --> 3:47:26.300]  to call for the very same thing that the establishment is doing anyway,
[3:47:26.300 --> 3:47:30.300]  while pretending to be some organic grassroots organization, which they're not.
[3:47:30.300 --> 3:47:35.300]  Meanwhile, UN to consider spraying sulphate aerosols above the Earth's surface to reduce global temperatures.
[3:47:35.300 --> 3:47:37.300]  What could possibly go wrong?
[3:47:37.300 --> 3:47:44.300]  They admit that it could cause crop failure, acid rain, a lack of enough rain in other regions of the world.
[3:47:44.300 --> 3:47:48.300]  But Bill Gates has publicly funded it and advocated for it since 2012,
[3:47:48.300 --> 3:47:51.300]  so they're probably going to go ahead and do it anyway.
[3:47:51.300 --> 3:47:57.300]  One person who doesn't really care about global climate change based on his own personal behavior is John Kerry.
[3:47:57.300 --> 3:48:01.300]  State Department denies Kerry took private jet to Obama party.
[3:48:01.300 --> 3:48:05.300]  Despite photos showing him exiting it, we have the Flight Aware Records,
[3:48:05.300 --> 3:48:11.300]  where it shows that Kerry's family private jet was used to fly into the party a couple of days ago.
[3:48:11.300 --> 3:48:14.300]  He's literally photographed exiting the plane.
