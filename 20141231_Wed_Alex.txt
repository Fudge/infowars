[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.160 --> 00:28.440]  gang members threaten New Year's Eve massacre of police officers meanwhile we
[00:28.440 --> 00:36.040]  have just stacks of news pouring in of different demonstrators chanting in New
[00:36.040 --> 00:39.960]  York you name it you know kill the police
[00:40.800 --> 00:45.920]  meanwhile government itself has been taken over by foreign interest that's
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.920]  where the real anger needs to be focused if this New Year's in the next year the
[00:52.920 --> 01:02.400]  social engineers are able to start this civil unrest or able to expand it it'll
[01:02.400 --> 01:06.160]  be a big victory for the globalist because this has meant to harden the
[01:06.160 --> 01:10.560]  police and complete their journey into being paramilitary death squads for the
[01:10.560 --> 01:17.920]  globalist and I see so many comments on YouTube and full wars calm I see it on
[01:17.920 --> 01:21.800]  mainstream news sites people saying well the cops are out of control this
[01:21.800 --> 01:29.280]  will teach them as if what a cop does in one jurisdiction is then projected on
[01:29.280 --> 01:34.940]  to every other police officer around the country this is the mad howl of the
[01:34.940 --> 01:40.720]  French Revolution we're hearing our revolution was focused based on ideas
[01:40.720 --> 01:44.960]  and was the most successful in human history hands down across the board
[01:44.960 --> 01:51.080]  every major political scientist historian agrees the French Revolution is
[01:51.080 --> 01:56.960]  hands down one of the most horrible revolutions proto-communist and it
[01:56.960 --> 02:03.320]  started with the royalty then it moved down to the enforcer class and then it
[02:03.320 --> 02:12.120]  just moved to your wife or your business and millions are estimated to have
[02:12.120 --> 02:17.120]  disappeared in the decade of the French Revolution and then what came out of the
[02:17.120 --> 02:23.120]  French Revolution but Napoleon Bonaparte and total tyranny so we know how
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.720]  these cycles work and I love all the armchair quarterbacks it's a minority of
[02:28.720 --> 02:35.760]  people that are on info wars calm and prison planet calm but they're not
[02:35.760 --> 02:40.200]  really because I can follow their discus accounts and go look at what they
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.880]  posted knew they are it's not really black people on info wars calm that are
[02:45.880 --> 02:51.080]  saying good kill the police let's get it started as best I could tell it's a
[02:51.080 --> 02:55.720]  bunch of teenagers and but also some veterans but then other veterans are
[02:55.720 --> 02:58.560]  getting in arguments with them other people around there saying well we
[02:58.560 --> 03:02.720]  just can't wait to get the soda and the popcorn out and watch all this it's
[03:02.720 --> 03:07.600]  totally sick is if you're going to go pull the trigger and blow somebody's
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.280]  innocent person's head off this is the dehumanization that I keep harping on
[03:13.280 --> 03:17.960]  where the police are being trained that we're dehumanized with the no hesitation
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.040]  training and then we're being trained that they're dehumanized and the
[03:23.040 --> 03:29.720]  globalists just sit offshore laughing at us as usual this is so obvious and I'm
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.360]  not going to harp on it all day pastor David Manning always informative but
[03:33.360 --> 03:36.800]  he's in the middle of Harlem he's been talking about this for a long time he's
[03:36.800 --> 03:39.200]  going to be joining us so we'll talk about some of this in the second hour

[03:43.800 --> 03:48.160]  third hour today as well as a second but there is just so much Anthony

[03:55.960 --> 04:01.880]  factory farm a whole new sector of disturbing factory farming activity
[04:01.880 --> 04:05.000]  let's see if I can get auntie in here today to talk about this and play this
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.680]  video describe it for radio listeners this is how my brain works here's an
[04:09.680 --> 04:13.880]  article Islamic State publishes interview with captured pilot asked
[04:13.880 --> 04:20.160]  Twitter followers how to killing when we had Twitter campaigns and Facebook
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.720]  campaigns exposing the fact that Navy SEALs were blown up they would delete
[04:25.720 --> 04:32.320]  and stop our tweets and our Facebook post but Islamic State now there's are
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.160]  allowed to operate calling for killing people and showing the murder of people
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.840]  meanwhile Twitter bands hashtag women against feminism founder for not seeing

[04:47.640 --> 04:53.080]  modern feminism as a way to enslave women but if you want to try to figure

[08:33.480 --> 08:39.920]  you for joining us on this live Wednesday worldwide broadcast it is now
[08:39.920 --> 08:48.080]  December 31st 2014 and john has a long mustache and we're broadcasting from
[08:48.080 --> 08:54.320]  deep behind enemy lines that of course is a line from the original red dawn the
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.280]  chair is against the wall the chair is against the wall john has a long
[08:59.280 --> 09:06.560]  mustache and for all of you on or behind enemy lines this songs for you in
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.080]  fact if you go back about 18 years ago I cut myself a liner with it with that
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.000]  from red dawn and then it went into a cool song I forget exactly what it was
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.080]  but we should redo that because it's an oldie but a goodie to illustrate that we
[09:22.080 --> 09:29.160]  are in quasi occupied under FEMA an emergency reorganization under the
[09:29.160 --> 09:37.040]  private federal reserve using the war powers act of 1933 we are under this
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.280]  emergency reorganization in fact Bernadine Smith of the second amendment
[09:42.280 --> 09:48.480]  foundation out in California about 16 years ago and I've torn apart our
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.680]  storage facilities if anybody can find it or I think she's still around we
[09:52.680 --> 09:57.080]  should get her on maybe she'll send me another one she sent me this huge binder
[09:57.080 --> 10:04.040]  that she made for the show that that I've shown on back then at an access
[10:04.040 --> 10:07.040]  television show I flipped through it on access television there's a tape of that
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.440]  somewhere but she had the actual not just photocopies of a lot of stuff the
[10:12.440 --> 10:22.320]  actual New York Times from 1937 with the 10 reorganization under the Federal
[10:22.320 --> 10:29.760]  Reserve regions as a proposal but admitting it was you know we've gotten
[10:29.760 --> 10:33.320]  out of the depression or partially and this is what will save America is the
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.920]  Federal Reserve directly running government out of the 10 regions and
[10:37.920 --> 10:44.880]  Jay Rockefeller John D thinks it's a fabulous idea and is financing it and
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.320]  hearing in Congress I mean that article itself or somebody's got to go to the
[10:49.320 --> 10:55.640]  microfilm and find the tip because it's pretty much the exact same regions a
[10:55.640 --> 11:02.440]  few of the lines are drawn differently but it's 10 regions and then by 1979 we
[11:02.440 --> 11:08.880]  went under that and so we can talk about Clinton and we can talk about Obama and
[11:08.880 --> 11:16.480]  we can talk about Jeb Bush all day long but in the final equation we're under
[11:16.480 --> 11:22.280]  an occupied government and you still have vestigial Congress and vestigial
[11:22.280 --> 11:26.320]  courts you still have the old system running parallel to it that isn't
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.720]  perfect but is our constitutional Republic and you've got the the new
[11:30.720 --> 11:38.400]  system they got a beachhead in 1913 for 101 years now it's been 101 years and a
[11:38.400 --> 11:47.640]  week exactly December 23rd 1913 three senators in the legal quorum call past
[11:47.640 --> 11:53.600]  the Federal Reserve Act they also then ran through the IRS Act and they also
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.160]  ran through with fake certifications from the states getting rid of senators
[11:58.160 --> 12:02.920]  being elected by legislators at the state level can you imagine the power
[12:02.920 --> 12:06.480]  states had then they were supposed to have the house was openly elected
[12:06.480 --> 12:11.160]  popularly elected so that gave the federal government some power there but
[12:11.160 --> 12:18.240]  the states voted at the legislature for the US senator people like Davy
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.160]  Crockett when he was a senator wouldn't do what he was exactly told by the
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.680]  legislature and they'd recall him and any other senator and get them on the
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.080]  floor and just interrogate them and chew them out and we're gonna have a vote
[12:33.080 --> 12:39.800]  right now to remove you we're gonna vote for a new senator right now today
[12:39.800 --> 12:47.560]  that's the kind of stuff went on and the reason I bring up those points of
[12:47.560 --> 12:59.000]  history is that now we have this Imperial federal government more and more
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.720]  and Imperial house leadership and Imperial Senate leadership an Imperial
[13:02.720 --> 13:11.560]  executive an Imperial judiciary and the very fabric of the Bill of Rights and
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.960]  Constitution is being openly dissolved and the final columns are being eaten
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.800]  away that hold up the Republic and once the Republic collapses we are in a
[13:22.800 --> 13:29.040]  all-alice vacuum the Rand Corporation for more than 30 years has prepared the
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.600]  militarization and corruption through asset for which are seizure and federal
[13:32.600 --> 13:38.040]  control of the police and the phony drug war the gayly and dialectic of
[13:38.040 --> 13:44.600]  problem-reaction solution and now they prepare I've said for over a decade I've
[13:44.600 --> 13:49.040]  been on there 20 years but over a decade when they prepare a civil war and they
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.560]  start promoting race war and they start promoting that the way to fight
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.080]  government is to go out and randomly shoot police you know they're preparing
[13:58.080 --> 14:03.200]  the National Stabilization Force to come out of the crisis that they are
[14:03.200 --> 14:09.840]  pulling the trigger on and now all of them like in an aircraft if you had a
[14:09.840 --> 14:13.760]  bunch of emergency switches and a bunch of emergency dials a bunch of
[14:13.760 --> 14:24.040]  emergency indicators and one's going often two three now the whole dash is
[14:24.040 --> 14:31.200]  going to smoke coming out of the engine alert alert alert it's all happening
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.440]  global government being openly announced the sexualization and targeting of our
[14:36.440 --> 14:41.920]  children accelerating just the open pharmacia being being dumped in the
[14:41.920 --> 14:48.920]  food supply and you see the cancer rates the retardation rates the deformity
[14:48.920 --> 14:54.800]  rates the diabetes rates the mental illness rates all skyrocketing
[14:54.800 --> 15:02.320]  exponentially up alert alert need those sounds out of Star Trek or something a
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.600]  Star Trek alert when you find one of those because that's what this is it's
[15:07.600 --> 15:12.880]  like 50 cling-on ships just uncloked and are firing on us and I'm just sitting
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.360]  here pointing it out that all the dials are just flashing red like a Christmas
[15:17.360 --> 15:24.000]  tree and you're seeing it start I mean I can't even cover all the videos and all
[15:24.000 --> 15:33.280]  the articles that just came out today of black-on-white attacks by folks watching
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.160]  mainstream media and MSNBC and and and the internet that just says the answer
[15:38.160 --> 15:45.720]  is randomly go out and knockout game you know attack some white people and now
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.120]  chilling threats popping up all over social media and any of them being
[15:50.120 --> 15:57.440]  painted on roadside's a couple be killed New Year's night in Rogers, Arkansas
[15:58.280 --> 16:07.600]  1231 14 MS 13 of course MS 13 targets police and the local media is like who's
[16:07.600 --> 16:17.960]  that and the issue here is this is all being allowed to get stirred up and then
[16:17.960 --> 16:23.600]  it will cause a reassurgence of the Ku Klux Klan who will go out and engage in
[16:23.600 --> 16:33.480]  the exact type of mindless tribal idiotic base systems and you will have
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.240]  groups of white youth I predict as this gets worse going out and like Cowards
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.360]  do targeting weak people old people notice that's who's being targeted by
[16:43.360 --> 16:49.600]  the racist black gangs old people young people people in wheelchairs and in the
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.720]  backdrop the excuse for all this is the gladiatorial videos we see everywhere a
[16:54.720 --> 16:59.760]  thug out of control police out of 2 million police in this country or more
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.160]  the training is bad the system is corrupt the society is unraveling there
[17:05.160 --> 17:09.920]  are a lot of bad departments there are a lot of bad police but it doesn't matter
[17:09.920 --> 17:18.280]  it's simply a detonator an excuse to start the conflagration and look at this
[17:18.280 --> 17:22.560]  black thug beats elderly man and suspected racial attack attack took
[17:22.560 --> 17:25.840]  place in broad daylight assailant did not seek money and this is the type of
[17:25.840 --> 17:32.680]  stuff I have that I just mentioned meanwhile Twitter bans hashtag women
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.120]  against feminism founder for saying Christmas is not oppressive to women
[17:37.120 --> 17:45.040]  account erased for quoting radical feminist own words Facebook Twitter people
[17:45.040 --> 17:49.840]  say well why are you on Facebook particularly sensors us in memes we put
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.280]  out in articles because it's a useful platform even when they're censoring us
[17:54.280 --> 17:59.040]  we're gonna stay in the fight they're trying to deny us that zone they're
[17:59.040 --> 18:04.120]  trying to deny us access for a reason and if I've had to threaten to sue Google
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.120]  or YouTube or I had to threaten and have lawyers send letters to Facebook which
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.600]  we've done I will do it because they claim they're this open free area as
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.200]  long as you don't violate their rules well if I don't violate their rules
[18:15.200 --> 18:18.560]  they're discriminating against me they're going to give me entrance into that
[18:18.560 --> 18:23.520]  so-called commons they just want to data mine the general public they don't want
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.760]  us in there warning people well guess what we're going to do it and just like
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.520]  the Navy SEAL groups that expose the Benghazi cover-up and things got their
[18:30.520 --> 18:34.480]  memes and sites shut down the woman behind a movement against radical
[18:34.480 --> 18:38.920]  feminism has had her Twitter account erased after she merely quoted the
[18:38.920 --> 18:42.480]  words of radical feminist she was engaging in debate with Janet Bloomfield's
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.880]  account Judy bitch won which had a mass 15,000 followers and both of the weekly
[18:47.880 --> 18:52.040]  reach were possibly 50,000 was removed from Twitter after Bloomfield an

[24:15.400 --> 24:22.000]  reported to police for hate crime of asking why a fat person is fat it
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.360]  became personally offensive and I believe it's a hate crime I'd like to
[24:25.360 --> 24:28.840]  report it we're gonna talk about political correctness some today when
[24:28.840 --> 24:35.320]  pastor David Manning joins us but this is the mind control target is in trouble
[24:35.320 --> 24:43.240]  for having a white Annie in their displays so it doesn't matter that the
[24:43.240 --> 24:49.640]  new movie is out and I believe that's a black Annie I think I saw the ad who
[24:49.640 --> 24:55.040]  cares you could have a black Annie a white Annie that's kind of like they
[24:55.040 --> 24:58.000]  used to appear pan was a boy now to be feminist they're making it a girl
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.560]  whatever it's the people that own the any franchise they can do whatever they
[25:04.560 --> 25:09.600]  want but see it's all about making that a crime or that's some type of dirty
[25:09.600 --> 25:15.800]  slight to someone but oh if you want to capture a pilot and then prepare to
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.920]  behead them and promote that online that's okay if you want to criticize
[25:20.920 --> 25:24.400]  feminism and say that it's a tyranny we're gonna delete your Twitter account
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.360]  or your Facebook account but if you want to go online and say kill Alex Jones
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.360]  all day oh there's not a problem something else I've noticed about this
[25:33.360 --> 25:37.800]  propaganda I've been saying forever we don't want violent revolution in this
[25:37.800 --> 25:40.600]  country and we don't want them to start a civil war we don't want them to
[25:40.600 --> 25:44.240]  infiltrate the militia and try to set the militia up for violence we know the
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.760]  feds have been caught doing that a lot means even in the New York Times that
[25:48.760 --> 25:53.640]  they've done that in almost every case the Atari militia who I warned was
[25:53.640 --> 25:57.520]  clearly being infiltrated and set up but months before they weren't even in the
[25:57.520 --> 26:01.680]  news and I saw one of their videos and played it and I said this is a setup I
[26:01.680 --> 26:07.320]  can see federal scripting then they went in and busted them they're sitting
[26:07.320 --> 26:10.600]  there driving along with them and the tapes that were released and you know
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.040]  the UN takes over starts putting us on camps and killing us what do we do well
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.720]  we might have to fight back to defend ourselves and then the judge even in the
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.040]  trial of the judges credit was like you've indicted them and held them for a
[26:22.040 --> 26:25.320]  year in jail for saying if there's a takeover and the government's killing
[26:25.320 --> 26:29.280]  everyone like Nazi Germany that they'll have to defend themselves and have to
[26:29.280 --> 26:34.360]  try to restore local government order with the police well we'll have to work
[26:34.360 --> 26:40.720]  with the locals to try to defend against that and try to try to stay and I could
[26:40.720 --> 26:43.720]  tell that group was being infiltrated by some of the members videos I was seeing
[26:43.720 --> 26:48.320]  online that were clearly meant to set them up and indeed it came out they'd
[26:48.320 --> 26:55.960]  been infiltrated by two feds one FBI agent one an informant as if you
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.120]  infiltrate a militia militias should be wearing suit and ties and out speaking
[27:00.120 --> 27:04.480]  at the city council meetings and then if you want to go do maneuver training and
[27:04.480 --> 27:11.720]  rural areas I love the militia always seems to do rural training as if you're
[27:11.720 --> 27:15.080]  gonna be in a bunch of rural combat with the New World Order we need to be in an
[27:15.080 --> 27:20.320]  info war combat to stop the physical war but if you're doing real training it
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.600]  would be taking over TV stations taking over radio stations not physically with
[27:24.600 --> 27:29.760]  your own equipment it'd be hacking in down the street to take them a week to
[27:29.760 --> 27:36.320]  figure it out it'd be how to do leaflet drops it'd be how to run psyops it'd be
[27:36.320 --> 27:42.800]  with the truth it'd be how to wake up locals and I'm not criticizing the
[27:42.800 --> 27:47.280]  militia I'm just showing how it's all a psyop just as the feds on record in the
[27:47.280 --> 27:52.000]  80s and 90s infiltrated militias set them up to look violent for the national
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.600]  news to demonize the idea of the constitutional militia that is just
[27:55.600 --> 28:01.480]  basically the civil defense or the posse as America is apple pie as George
[28:01.480 --> 28:07.280]  Washington and they did a pretty good job demonizing it didn't they well now
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.080]  they want to demonize the idea of legitimate demonstration against
[28:12.080 --> 28:15.720]  globalization against loss of property rights against violations of free speech
[28:15.720 --> 28:19.560]  that are totally legitimate well how do you do that well you just send in a
[28:19.560 --> 28:26.840]  bunch of Ford Foundation anarchist rich kid 20 year old zit faced lackeys to go
[28:26.840 --> 28:32.840]  around saying deck the halls with dead cops in Ferguson in New York leading it
[28:32.840 --> 28:37.320]  are a bunch of communist agitators we showed people on TV on the nightly news
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.280]  the signs and the groups that they were handing out to the black people there
[28:42.280 --> 28:46.120]  wasn't one black person that we've caught on videotape anywhere in this
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.600]  country leading any of this it's a bunch of communist agitators and you can go
[28:50.600 --> 28:54.520]  right back to the workers party and the Communist Party if they don't even hide
[28:54.520 --> 28:59.200]  it it's on the signs and let me tell you I got a lot of problem with police
[28:59.200 --> 29:02.520]  training and bad cops that are out there and I get upset about it I wrote the
[29:02.520 --> 29:08.160]  book on it literally and made Ford films on it trying to stop it but let me tell
[29:08.160 --> 29:11.520]  you I the cops had a lot of restraint in fact I think too much you come marching

[29:16.800 --> 29:21.480]  dead family you're gonna get punched in the nose because that's a violent
[29:21.480 --> 29:26.000]  threat but notice they're being told to stand down and let it just stir up and
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.360]  stir up and stir up it's so incredibly obvious the destabilization of this
[29:32.360 --> 29:36.520]  country of Russia of the Middle East meanwhile we're fighting over target ads

[35:19.720 --> 35:25.120]  have you guys print me that opening page I want to read that thank you or put it
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.480]  on screen it's it's so apropos lost a couple family members this year my
[35:30.480 --> 35:36.760]  grandmother should have a lot of real serious health problems this year and a
[35:36.760 --> 35:42.520]  lot of other major attacks go on but at the same time the some of the best things
[35:42.520 --> 35:46.200]  that ever happened to us for getting the truth out happened this year as well so
[35:46.200 --> 35:49.400]  you got to take the good with the bad and I am very blessed and honored to be
[35:49.400 --> 35:54.240]  here and I thank God for consciousness and I thank God that my heart turns
[35:54.240 --> 36:00.200]  towards good and then I want to be good and I think Jesus for his sacrifice on
[36:00.200 --> 36:04.440]  the cross I just love Christ so much and I couldn't do any of this without my
[36:04.440 --> 36:08.720]  Lord the Savior Jesus Christ and I just ask God to help humble me more and help
[36:08.720 --> 36:14.240]  make me strong going back to the quote from a tale of two cities by Charles
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.920]  Dickens one of my favorite writers it was the best of times it was the worst of
[36:17.920 --> 36:26.360]  times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch
[36:26.360 --> 36:32.720]  of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.720]  was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of
[36:36.720 --> 36:43.480]  despair we had everything before us we had nothing before us we were all going
[36:43.480 --> 36:49.760]  direct to heaven we were all going direct the other way in short the period
[36:49.760 --> 36:53.920]  was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities
[36:53.920 --> 37:01.480]  insisted on it being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree of
[37:01.480 --> 37:08.680]  comparison only nobody can write like Charles Dickens every paragraph of all
[37:08.680 --> 37:17.240]  of his books are so rich and our poetry and the average person is so dumb down
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.400]  today they can't even understand that and I don't say that from an elitist
[37:21.400 --> 37:26.080]  perspective I have trouble reading it and understanding it once I grasp it it's
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.360]  so beautiful pearls before swine though for the general public now they're
[37:31.360 --> 37:41.760]  wrecked mines are salvageable though in my humble opinion I want to open the
[37:41.760 --> 37:49.320]  phones up what do you think the most important news it's good to reflect they
[37:49.320 --> 37:52.520]  want us always moving so fast and the rat race are only focusing on what's
[37:52.520 --> 37:55.560]  currently happening we don't reflect what was the most important thing that
[37:55.560 --> 38:00.920]  happened in 2014 good or bad and in your gut what do you think 2015 is going to
[38:00.920 --> 38:04.800]  be like you can see the destabilization campaign economically spiritually
[38:04.800 --> 38:12.120]  culturally physically taking place everywhere you can see evil pulling out
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.040]  the stops as global government plays every nation and every people off against
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.320]  each other was scientific a plumb
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.800]  like a center feud sucking everything into the center sucking out the energy
[38:29.800 --> 38:35.440]  sucking out the wealth waging war debasing the currencies to build the
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.720]  giant corporate world government exempt from the laws exempt from the taxes the
[38:39.720 --> 38:50.160]  new royalty above us modern scientific godlike versions of Kim Jong-un but
[38:50.160 --> 38:57.520]  just as disgusting and stinking and their colossal scale you stare at Kim
[38:57.520 --> 39:01.200]  Jong-un and you can grasp the foolishness the weakness the entitlement
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.000]  everything given to him the pleasure palaces the sex slaves the torture the
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  death you can see the rot in a man who can hardly walk and he's a young man you
[39:12.000 --> 39:21.680]  can see the soul sucked out of his eyes and still you do not pity him even though
[39:21.680 --> 39:29.800]  it was born into it the filth spawned of a communist king and his communist son
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.360]  and the next third line of filth and then we look up from that that we can
[39:35.360 --> 39:48.080]  laugh at in all its horror and then stare upon the true god of evil does not
[39:48.080 --> 39:56.360]  look so weak as Kim Jong-un so much more sophisticated a thousand times a
[39:56.360 --> 40:06.840]  thousand slicker and more creeping the devil of the West the West is the best
[40:06.840 --> 40:14.880]  to quote Jim Morrison and it'll do the rest yeah I'm talking about Texas Big
[40:14.880 --> 40:24.120]  Beat radio all right enough they tried to bury us they didn't know we were
[40:24.120 --> 40:34.680]  seeds Mexican proverb no army can stop an idea whose time has come it is only
[40:34.680 --> 40:39.760]  through the oppression that we become strong the problem is the oppression is
[40:39.760 --> 40:46.040]  psychic it's cultural they gave us ugly icons they gave us stinking icons they
[40:46.040 --> 40:50.520]  gave us failed systems and twisted art and things that didn't make sense look
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.440]  at children's cartoons now total mindless gibber and it's declassified
[40:55.440 --> 41:02.160]  that it's meant to screw them up what type of elite would seek to screw up
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.520]  children the same ones that would put sodium fluoride in the water known to
[41:07.520 --> 41:09.800]  lower IQ 10 points we're drinking just a few years
[41:09.800 --> 41:15.240]  Harvard study look it up thousands of studies thousands and thousands and
[41:15.240 --> 41:19.720]  thousands every decade going back to the 20s University of Texas had the same
[41:19.720 --> 41:26.440]  findings as Harvard in a 1932 study I've read on air about testing it on pigs
[41:26.440 --> 41:35.480]  and rats the infertility the obesity the lethargy you give fluoride water to
[41:35.480 --> 41:44.240]  horses for a year they're dead anybody that's in horse or cow production will
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.360]  tell you that you do not give them city water and anybody that goes into the
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.800]  horse business and near a city and uses tap water finds out real soon and if
[41:54.800 --> 41:57.720]  they hire anybody around their stables that knows they go you don't give them
[41:57.720 --> 42:02.720]  city water full of chlorine and fluoride I kill your horses to something
[42:02.720 --> 42:07.760]  thoroughbred like that can't take as many insults as a human the more beautiful
[42:07.760 --> 42:15.200]  the stronger the more elegant the less insults you can take horses can't handle
[42:15.200 --> 42:22.040]  fluoride folks but I digress this is the same system attacking us willing to hurt
[42:22.040 --> 42:28.800]  us willing that killer blow upon humanity and all the big billionaire tech
[42:28.800 --> 42:36.200]  people whether it's joy or feel or Schmidt or Kurzweil all of them to a man
[42:36.200 --> 42:40.000]  are in the news every couple weeks going I'm gonna live forever I'm gonna be a
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.840]  God I'm gonna merge with computers the planetary government is coming humans
[42:43.840 --> 42:47.080]  are done it's all over and you're hurting the earth and yes the
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.920]  discussions are how do we get rid of you they were righted in article after
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.240]  article after article I've made film after film and given you a report after
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.600]  report as they sit there openly discussing what they're going to do to us
[43:00.600 --> 43:05.440]  how they're gonna release the airborne Ebola how they're gonna set up the death
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.720]  panels how they're gonna reduce our population down to zero at the Ted talk
[43:09.720 --> 43:17.400]  with Bill Gates and the crowd laughs when he puts up the equation that shows
[43:17.400 --> 43:22.600]  zero humans use how many get to this number is the only question and he puts
[43:22.600 --> 43:26.160]  up the equation that says all humans will be killed and you've got this trendy
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.200]  group in there they know how to read an equation and it's so funny because they
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.720]  know the public hit from birth with fluoride and GMO and television with
[43:34.720 --> 43:38.120]  their brains wired wrong doesn't see a threat coming at them because they're
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.840]  not wired see we still got our instincts even though they brain damages but
[43:42.840 --> 43:48.000]  we're hardwired that we go into the cave at night big cats like to sit at the
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.600]  entrance that's why kids have an instinct not to want to go in and out of
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.200]  doorways at night it's been proven with epigenetics because she big cats in
[43:56.200 --> 44:01.440]  every culture wouldn't eat a big male or female coming out of the cave to urinate
[44:01.440 --> 44:06.080]  or whatever at night but a little three-year-old coming out is a juicy
[44:06.080 --> 44:11.520]  treat and so children are scared of doorways and entrances all over the
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.400]  world they don't know why they're scared but there's monsters with big teeth
[44:16.400 --> 44:20.920]  well there are none of those monsters today unless you're living in Africa or
[44:20.920 --> 44:25.480]  India but let me tell you if you didn't have those instincts you wouldn't be
[44:25.480 --> 44:32.320]  alive but see we do we have instincts to face GMO in our food do we have
[44:32.320 --> 44:36.200]  instincts to face fluoride no order we have instincts to face computer games
[44:36.200 --> 44:40.240]  and TV that rewires children's brains and brain damages them on record look it
[44:40.240 --> 44:49.280]  up are we ready to face binary weapons in the food supply do we know how to
[44:49.280 --> 44:53.240]  face global corporate government where the armies wear suits and meet in a
[44:53.240 --> 44:57.480]  secret and meanwhile deploy systems to make us kill each other over what
[44:57.480 --> 45:03.920]  color we are well humans follow instinct but humans can also transcend at
[45:03.920 --> 45:10.120]  points in our development and make jumps evolutionary jumps and I don't mean
[45:10.120 --> 45:13.720]  evolution in the debate between the eugenicist Darwin and your local
[45:13.720 --> 45:21.480]  preacher it says I ain't no you know there ain't no monkey my uncle everybody
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.400]  laughs we're not talking about the fake debates they set up see that's the mind
[45:24.400 --> 45:29.240]  control we're talking about evolutionary jumps in technology evolutionary jumps
[45:29.240 --> 45:34.960]  and understanding awakenings we could stop this if we just decided we had
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.240]  value if we just decided we weren't crap and if we started acting like it sort of
[45:39.240 --> 45:43.800]  having strength and honor the average person in the government and in the
[45:43.800 --> 45:47.680]  corporate system wants that but they've been kept small they've been kept
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.440]  corralled they've been kept in authoritarian systems and they're now
[45:51.440 --> 45:57.100]  just deploying on to us what they've already been under and so we will reach
[45:57.100 --> 46:03.920]  them with the passion of the truth the sexiness of the truth the beauty of
[46:03.920 --> 46:08.680]  freedom if you just have freedom and are offering freedom I'm not selling
[46:08.680 --> 46:16.480]  freedom I'm showing you where it is wild horses will drag them to us but
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.160]  you're not going to need wild horses to drag them away to freedom you couldn't
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.260]  hold them but meanwhile we're told out of this whole world government IMF
[46:26.260 --> 46:34.720]  World Bank XM Bank UN global treaties DARPA the CIA defense intelligence NSA
[46:34.720 --> 46:37.840]  all the other agencies of the world all the other secret societies of the
[46:37.840 --> 46:46.960]  planet that the enemy is the police so we'll attack the police harden them to
[46:46.960 --> 46:57.680]  then be servants of the system or the enemy is a white man at a bus stop beat
[46:57.680 --> 47:02.160]  his head and show the whites when I guarantee you that old white man goes
[47:02.160 --> 47:06.360]  back to his tiny apartment and barely has enough food to eat and this is a poor
[47:06.360 --> 47:10.040]  area of the story about it and lives just like a black guy right next door to
[47:10.040 --> 47:14.440]  him is poor watches the same television shows has the same hopes and dreams has
[47:14.440 --> 47:25.080]  the same red blood they got us killing each other see how that works because
[47:25.080 --> 47:33.240]  tribalism is our instincts it's not just children afraid of a big cat or hyena or
[47:33.240 --> 47:40.200]  some wolves going to eat them if they go out away from mommy and daddy if they
[47:40.200 --> 47:44.600]  go outside the house when it's dark that's when the predators hunt but see
[47:44.600 --> 47:49.920]  nowadays the predators hunt in broad daylight with slick advertising and all
[47:49.920 --> 47:57.480]  the packaging of a game show host where you're invited to the party why you're
[47:57.480 --> 48:02.760]  lucky to be part of the new world order speaking of slick advertising
[48:02.760 --> 48:07.680]  we don't really have slick advertising I just try to develop the very best hot
[48:07.680 --> 48:13.960]  products I can that I personally use whether it's the Pro Pure G2 filters
[48:13.960 --> 48:20.320]  and clearly filtered discounted 10% off promo code water or weather it is the

[54:18.200 --> 54:23.680]  tomorrow I thought we should do something but there's just not time in
[54:23.680 --> 54:26.360]  three hours to get to all of them so we're gonna have a special sometime next
[54:26.360 --> 54:32.120]  week where we're going to air on the nightly news more of the interviews but
[54:32.120 --> 54:37.360]  Vigo Mortensen Charlton Heston Geraldo Rivera rowdy Piper Jesse Ventura
[54:37.360 --> 54:43.520]  Russell brand Mike judge lead singer a corn Michael Savage Joe Rogan Dave
[54:43.520 --> 54:52.520]  Mustaine Willie Nelson David DeRoth child and a whole bunch of other people the
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.560]  famous folks that have been on the show and talked about the New World Order
[54:55.560 --> 55:05.080]  Billy Corrigan the list really does go on and on we should probably rear some of
[55:05.080 --> 55:09.840]  the best interviews or parts of it with Ted Nugent I mean just just in fact send
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.560]  us emails at show tips and info wars calm who would you like to hear a boil
[55:13.560 --> 55:18.000]  down best of interview with I mean there have been so many
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.240]  I like it when I had like the number three in the Japanese government on about
[55:21.240 --> 55:28.200]  911 million inside job or when we had folks on from the Fukushima reactor or
[55:28.200 --> 55:34.480]  when I had the former head of this German CIA Andres from Mulo on or General
[55:34.480 --> 55:38.000]  Hamid ghoul on the former head of Pakistani intelligence I mean those are
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.360]  the really cool interviews are like when I've had Navy SEAL families on about the
[55:42.360 --> 55:46.480]  bomb in the helicopter to get rid of them because the bin Laden raid was fake I
[55:46.480 --> 55:51.440]  think of those as epic interviews we should probably from time to time
[55:51.440 --> 55:57.040]  dredge that stuff up and do just most hardcore interview flashbacks because we
[55:57.040 --> 56:05.440]  never do this but tomorrow we're gonna have a whole bunch of stuff I don't know
[56:05.440 --> 56:08.320]  we could air some of the Charlie Sheen stuff for he went off the rails
[56:08.320 --> 56:13.720]  Charlie's really a sweet guy known him for like 10 years now but I tell you I
[56:13.720 --> 56:16.680]  should never let him do that last interview winning for an hour and a
[56:16.680 --> 56:19.320]  half went off on his family and stuff I've already apologized for that I'm
[56:19.320 --> 56:25.160]  never gonna air any sheen stuff but there's a lot here there's a lot so
[56:25.160 --> 56:28.000]  that's a lot of that's coming up tomorrow crew is working really hard to
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.240]  get that together so I'll be tuned into Mara I know certainly and I'll be back
[56:32.240 --> 56:39.160]  live Lord willing you never know Friday here in studio and next Sunday for the
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.280]  four to six transmission as well we're gonna go to break come back with
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.840]  pastured manning I'm gonna give the number out on the race war the system's
[56:47.840 --> 56:51.280]  trying to start do you agree to you disagree I'd like to hear from the folks
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.040]  out there that are criticizing me because even the police were pure evil
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.480]  which they're not the system wants us to go out and have violence with them to
[57:00.480 --> 57:05.680]  bring in martial law and this is clearly the false flag folks and I've been
[57:05.680 --> 57:13.480]  predicting it it's not like I just started saying this now and so I've
[57:13.480 --> 57:17.040]  noticed I'm getting a lot of more threats and stuff now because like you
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.680]  side with the police you're dead too I'm siding with justice and common sense and
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.200]  not being part of cold-blooded murder of innocent people when the cops do it
[57:26.200 --> 57:31.480]  they should get in trouble but the people that did it should not some cop in
[57:31.480 --> 57:34.560]  another state just like when somebody else does something I don't get blamed
[57:34.560 --> 57:40.520]  for it what's good for the goose is good for the gander but back to the

[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:16.400]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:22.720]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones all right we're into our
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:27.440]  number two i want to get your take on the attempt or maybe disagree to start a
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.880]  race war in this country you know i keep bringing this topic up at least once a
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.880]  week in detail because now there's new evidence of it we're gonna be going over
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:41.680]  some of that with pastor manning we're going to get into obama advisor
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:47.320]  jonathan grimmer in 2009 obama care will not be affordable that's what he said
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.200]  on record but then he came out and lied about it this criticism for proposed
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.800]  asset forfeiture law where the police are start grabbing your cars and stuff for
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.120]  what they claim are petty crimes and under the federal guidelines they don't
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.240]  even have to even charge you or convict you and see that is a corruption of the
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.320]  system the police should not carry out this piratical asset forfeiture
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.080]  seizure so they're partly to blame but the real blame is the governing criminal
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.160]  class and us for letting it happen we need to change it recall the criminals
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.080]  that run new york and other areas and change it and not just say you know the
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.880]  cop out of right wingers that i love well i'm just waiting till the un shows up
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.200]  blue helmets i'm gonna start you know fighting start killing they're not gonna
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.920]  show up blue helmets folks it's gonna be a civil war first that the globalists
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.200]  are just gonna come in here no and and the same thing for the left while we're
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.360]  just gonna burn everything kill the police i saw an article last week that
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.400]  i'm not even gonna mention to give it attention and it creeped into a link in
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:58.920]  one of our stories by by a fella attacking the new york police who by all
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.160]  means are not a bunch of angels out of control and just a reflection of society
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:11.040]  but then i happened to have been to dinner with the person when they showed
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.000]  their real side i was with rob do was there started talking about once the
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.480]  communists take over and he's really a communist they're gonna kill everybody
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.760]  that doesn't go along with them and the police and all the rest of it and i was
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.720]  sitting there and he was really getting off talking about killing people and i've
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.880]  been around communists before when they do this and i ended up never even air in
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:40.040]  the interview because it was just a lust of for killing and really chilling and
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.600]  if they're able to cause a civil war and have a leftist takeover and they start
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.960]  trying to come around everybody up it's a good thing we got the second
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.480]  amendment it's a good thing we're ready because i'm not looking to kill
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.720]  anybody i'm not looking for trouble but let me tell you something i'm not going
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.200]  on any truck to some reeducation camp or a bunch of piece of crap communist are
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.040]  gonna torture me and have their way with my family it ain't happening okay so all
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.240]  you guys that are all macho and just can't wait to have your black uniforms
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.960]  on and have us all the way you want it you're never gonna get there because
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.800]  people know who you are and we're ready and we're not stupid either we're not
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.040]  gonna be part of your dumb civil war and so we know you're gonna blow stuff up
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.280]  and blame it on us and we're wise of that we've been beaten the pavement and
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.680]  the airwaves and the print to warn everybody we're making films we have
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.520]  the tens of millions of listeners the Liberty movement is gaining steam
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.840]  you're in deep trouble and that's why you're working so hard around the clock
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.720]  right now to distract us with a civil war escape go to the police for
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.760]  everything that's happening because you know we're on your tail and you can you
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.720]  can feel the fire lapping your butt and i know my greatest frustration is i know
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:59.080]  that if this country ever finds its will and if men ever find their masculinity
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:05.080]  and their strength not to act tough but to have the will to tell the truth and
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:12.000]  the will to research the facts and the will to speak to others in public that's
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.760]  where the real fight is if you won't go speak in public now or support those that
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:22.200]  speak in public you will never lift a gun when the time comes all the people
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.480]  that talk about what they're gonna do with guns I expect very few of them
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.280]  will actually carry out the things they've said but those of us that are
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:39.160]  preparing for our defense we won't talk about it we will defend and once it
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  starts you know what the best defense is don't you so you listen to me people on
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.560]  the establishment just like Hitler was warned or the communists were you think
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.720]  you're gonna get away with this offshore everybody knows who you are and you pull
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.720]  this you're gonna get it in the end and that's not a threat that's a law of
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.480]  nature every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape and the
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.120]  truth is it's hard even with diet and exercise because of toxic food in our
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.000]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before working with

[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.640]  Eve sources say from Florida to California police are getting shot at
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.520]  all over Twitter Facebook YouTube you name it folks are calling for me to get
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:35.400]  killed you can go to info wars calm and see it anywhere you search it and that
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.600]  anybody that doesn't agree with massacring police and cold blood is a pig
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.080]  lover well I know this I'm a due process lover and I'm not for a French
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.040]  revolution in this country where anybody that's worked for the government or
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.680]  anybody that's worked in the corporation gets killed or where anybody's been in a
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:01.280]  uniform gets killed I know so many good people that are police officers I also
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:07.320]  grew up in a suburban Dallas and saw the police kill drugs and also saw them a
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:12.560]  year after we moved away because of it we moved to Austin because of my dad's
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.360]  old is dental offices because of it I saw the that Sheriff's Department and that
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:21.680]  police department busted for dealing the drugs in fact Rolling Stone magazine
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.280]  didn't even believe me about that and then went and looked it up and found out
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.780]  it was all true in a piece they did a couple years ago on me or was it a
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.040]  squire
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.960]  now first it was Texas Monthly then it was Rolling Stone mentioned it the point
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.280]  is not name dropping I'm just saying that really happened so I know that stuff
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.920]  goes on the point is the system in my view wants to start a civil war and we
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.880]  have sources inside Homeland Security that I have other sources have that were
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:57.680]  saying this two years ago and I halfway rolled my eyes I mean I knew MSNBC was
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.360]  trying to create racial division CNN I knew that's all they had because black
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.080]  unemployment had doubled under Obama I knew that all they had was racial
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.400]  politics that's what socialists and communists do I knew it was communist
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.960]  agitators that were out there trying to get to start up years ago but to
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.480]  actually see it going on and to see the Justice Department doing it which will
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.080]  then legitimize the militarization and federalization of police as an answer to
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.080]  this new war zone mentality that's being entered into that will then be used to
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:35.120]  oppress the general public and yes we'll make it more against a cop versus
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.480]  black thing as well when I've had white cops do really unconstitutional things
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:47.480]  to me I've had black cops do it and it's the training it's the system instead of
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:53.200]  having a serious discussion about reforming this we see now it going
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.240]  into overdrive I mean I've got two or three of these videos today black thug
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.720]  beats elderly man and suspected racial attack attack took place in broad daylight
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.400]  assailant did not seek money Adon Salazar in full wars calm ABC news has
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.920]  video killing threats to kill cops in New York in Arkansas in other areas now
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.880]  the Mexican gangs are getting involved if you believe what's being put out MS-13
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.280]  does target police so we don't know this threats from them they say it's from
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:26.200]  them could there be false flags by the system yes police have been caught
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:32.200]  provocaturing things when they're under federal control in Seattle 99 in other
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.360]  areas but the police departments out there actually really concerned right
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.320]  now they're on alert right now but they've already been getting hardened
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.520]  because the feds told them this was coming because the feds aren't the feds
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.840]  they're run by the globalists they are triggering this now I'm done ranting
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.360]  about it I've got all the news I want to get to with our guest but he's been
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.320]  warning about this and I want to get his insight because he remember him on the
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.480]  show four years ago saying Obama is gonna become a dictator and I said no
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.880]  he's not pastor Manning well now he's an elected dictator like Hitler on
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:10.200]  borders on guns on UN treaties on our energy systems on Obamacare he's changed
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.360]  that hundreds and hundreds of times actually 2,000 times has been changed
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.680]  but over 200 orders that had hundreds of changes sometimes a piece comes to over
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:27.760]  2,000 changes to Obamacare that aren't done by law so even Jonathan Turley the
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.120]  big liberal professor constitutional law scholar says Obama is basically a
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.400]  dictator Ron Paul has said it countless others have but the Republican leadership
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.160]  even though they were given this huge mandate will not move to block him on
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.560]  any front because they're bought and paid for by the same wicked interest
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.240]  offshore who want us here killing each other now pastor Manning grew up in the
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.520]  south went up to New York I'm not gonna go over his interesting history it's on
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:01.240]  his website otlet.org ATLAH.org an excellent website excellent radio TV
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.680]  ministry they also feeds over the years over the year thousands of youth
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.360]  hundreds every day at their church free food for the kids there through his
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:19.520]  ministry and he's no stranger to this audience I wanted to get pastor Manning
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:29.400]  on the broadcast today again I wanted to get pastor James David Manning on the
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.960]  transmission because he is uniquely situated at the epicenter of this one of
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.000]  the twin epicenters Missouri and St. Louis area but he's in New York he's in
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.320]  Harlem and he has seen what the social engineering has done it's been deployed
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.800]  against the black community but it's been tested on them it's being used
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.760]  against everybody right now with great effects I want to get his take on the
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.800]  current stuff does he agree there's an attempt to start a race war to distract
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.840]  where does he see it going and since he accurately predicted what Obama would do
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.560]  I thought it was being streamed for five years ago on the show I want to hear
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.960]  what he thinks the next chapter will be so pastor otlet.org thank you so much
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.600]  for coming on thank you Alex for having me and happy new year to you and and
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.040]  let me say this I mean I've heard all of what you've stated I'm here at the
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.480]  epicenter you're right about that I've told people I've advised people that
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.240]  there is threatening to be a surge against police officers today tonight
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:33.080]  New Year's Eve down in Times Square against police officers I've told people
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.800]  to be very careful about being out there because I suspect that these
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.320]  protesters these neo-Leninists these communist people that they're planning on
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.440]  creating an uprising but I want to put that on the table for just a moment
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.680]  Alex let me tell you what I think is going to happen next year right I did
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.600]  say that Obama is a dictator it was clear that he was based on his history in
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:02.160]  Jeremiah Wright's church his belief in Saul Alinsky his communist Muslim if you
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.160]  will background that he had so it was very easy to determine who he's going to
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.800]  be but here's what I want to say Alex I want to say in light of what you said
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.360]  regarding these folk at these homeland security people and their black
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.400]  uniforms and looking to put us on FEMA camps and card us away to these re
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.000]  education centers I want to say that the next movement is going to be the
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:32.800]  movement of what I'm declaring is the 70 million strong voices that are
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.080]  Christians that are patriots that believe in this nation and they've just
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.600]  had enough of it they're tired of being kicked around they're tired of all the
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.920]  race baiting they're tired of how Obama is using his powers illegally in the
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:54.320]  White House they have just had enough of all of this foolishness that's getting
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.400]  worse the shooting down of police officers in their patrol cars these
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.320]  young boys out in the streets without fathers without morals without conscious
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.680]  without a concern a love for God and then you've got people being the saint
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.960]  put into sainthood after they just tried to kill a police officer and just robbed
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.880]  a convenience store and threatened the owner and now he's a saint people have
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:25.360]  had enough and the next move is not while I'm I'm sure that FEMA or Homeland
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.840]  Security or the Obama thugs and others want to have the next move to advance
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.040]  their new world order concerns but I'm saying that the next move is going to
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.000]  come from the 70 million Americans who just had enough of this they've had
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.640]  enough of it I mean it's just gotten worse people's patience have been worn
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.160]  thin people have tried to be amenable they've tried to be charitable they've
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:55.320]  tried to understand that some of the concerns that people have expressed
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.880]  about how this nation has been going for the last 50 or 60 years but I think
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.360]  people have there they've had their last mouthful of that so I'm saying the next
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.400]  move needs to come from people such as yourself and me who are part of this 70
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.240]  million who have looked to Congress we've looked at the House of Representatives
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.920]  we've looked to the courts to some degree even to the media to try to pull us
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.720]  up and and legit legit legitimatize the things that we want to have happen in
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.360]  our nation they've not done it so people I believe the grassroots people are
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.920]  gonna stand up and say enough is enough and I'll have more to say about that
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.760]  and I think I'll just stop and give you a break here so you can say something
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.640]  but that's where it's coming from next pastor James David Manning of OTTLA.org
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.160]  a big national voice out there warning of what was coming and it's now
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:46.960]  unfolding I want to look at Obama's agenda we know he's a front man of a
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.800]  larger global government operation but for so many followers I mean they think
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.560]  he really is in charge and to a great extent he is even if he is you know kind
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.680]  of a puppet of the Socialist and others he really is operating now as a
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:06.040]  dictator that's admitted look at how far we've come so I ask you two years left
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.680]  in office where are we now going to go especially when the Republican leadership
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:16.000]  as you said has green-lighted him to do anything he wants it only seems to be
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.360]  encouraging the Justice Department as the former deputy FBI director said
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.880]  last week to be behind stirring up all the civil unrest there are legitimate
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.880]  problems with police in many areas there are legitimate problems with the
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.640]  Bill of Rights and Constitution being violated we harp on it but but you know
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:39.080]  Alex you know that's a kill at cops I mean I mean that is gonna that is gonna
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:44.480]  discredit demonstration itself sorry go ahead but if you look at it and examine
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:48.760]  it closely when you talk about the people that idolize Obama or think
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:52.920]  there's somehow another he's in charge he is in charge of some things that is
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.200]  destroying them if you look at as you stated earlier black unemployment for
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.680]  black people has doubled under the leadership of Obama racism has gone
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.160]  off the charts under the leadership of Obama food stamps has increased by as
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:13.280]  much as 35% under the leadership of Obama so effectively Alex what's happening
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.760]  is that black people are African-Americans or whatever it is they
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:22.680]  want to call themselves are doing worse I mean were I you know just observing
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.080]  this if I was if I was in that cadre of mindset I would turn around and say hey
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.120]  this man's trying to kill us we were better off we had better jobs were better
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:37.800]  employed and listen to this Alice this amnesty that Obama is doing the few
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.400]  jobs that black or African-American or whatever it is they want to refer to
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.920]  themselves as have at present that this and validating anywhere from five to
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.920]  twenty million illegals is going to make the employment situation of black
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:58.400]  people absolutely nil which is going to increase crime it's going to increase the
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:03.120]  problems in the community it's going to increase and fill up the jails so I
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.280]  mean anyone with a reasonable understanding of looking at what's
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.360]  happening in our world today would have to say about black people I can get
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.840]  to other people in just a moment but black people in particular Alex are
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:21.920]  doing far worse it looks as if he's trying to drive black people into
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:27.520]  extinction I mean the streets are filled with murder there are no jobs I mean
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.000]  it's absolutely incredible what he is doing and everywhere and I'm not
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.840]  lionizing the Republicans but it's just a fact everywhere the Democrats are in
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:42.240]  full control areas of New York Chicago DC other areas are crime-filled hell
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.080]  holes people being shot and killed every day the public disarmed if I was a
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.960]  space alien like you were just mentioning from Mars watching with a
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:56.320]  telescope and listening to the radio reports and in watching things I would
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:03.560]  name Obama something like Obama the black destroyer or Obama the destroyer
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:09.680]  blacks I mean I would see him as a as a person who was waging war on blacks if
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:13.960]  you just just wade things but see that's the perfect genius of putting in the
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:20.340]  so-called black preacher because that's what they've as you said trained him to
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:26.280]  do with the so-called black preacher there in Chicago is to go out and stir
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:31.360]  up the new religion of hatred but then you end up losing everything you've got
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.560]  you end up losing God you end up losing Liberty you end up losing
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.640]  prosperity and in the end all you've got ten times the racism I mean my gosh
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.880]  talk about kill seal and destroy when it comes down to it is not Obama in a way
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.680]  almost the devil to black people but I've called him the son of Satan and he
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.040]  is indeed that and he is a pimp because that's what pimps do they destroy the
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.960]  people that they are led to represent and the ignorance of those who are
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.040]  prostitutes for pimps believe that somehow or another they have that the
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.320]  pimp has their best interest at heart so that's what I called him from day one
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.800]  that's what I'll label him from day one and that's exactly what he is
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.520]  manifesting and I think the world has began to see it but he's also destroying
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:22.000]  the liberals and the progressives as well in terms of destroying the middle
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.720]  class and destroying the fiber of the nation and turning our nation over to
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.320]  the New World Order if you will the deep pocket people who are the banksters
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.280]  that I refer to as the Wall Street types and yet he has broken down all
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:43.160]  morality he has broken all broken down all sense of who people were as
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.640]  Christians he has destroyed the fiber of the church I mean it's absolutely
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.600]  incredible that he has been able to accomplish this through the both of
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.760]  these if you will weak-minded groups they were weak-minded before Obama I have
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.320]  to tell you that the black groups of African-Americans and the progressive
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.240]  liberals if you will they were all very weak-minded and didn't have a lot of
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:11.280]  moral strength well sure I mean going back to Margaret Sanger that's what I
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.400]  was getting at targeting black preachers like Reverend Jeremiah Wright and others
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.880]  to have them operate when from what I've read and seen they're not even
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:23.600]  Christians they're communists and know full well what they're doing
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:29.000]  absolutely no you're right about that and I think they should be called
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.880]  neo-Linus a neo-communist because their brand of communism is designed to be
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.200]  able while at the same time think people have have people think they have some
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:44.560]  sense of being a capitalist and having an economy that favors them in some
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:51.720]  regard and but it certainly is a lie it isn't true there most people especially
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.720]  blacks have been kept at the very bottom of the economic structure and and many
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.920]  of these progressive liberals are kept at the bottom as well so I mean the plan
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.440]  is working perfectly there needs to be a response to Obama's plan and I'm
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.560]  saying there ought to be the 70 million people that who's an unlike the silent
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:15.760]  majority that Nixon phrased some time ago I believe there's 70 million stoned
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.840]  down patriots Christians lovers of America who have just been too silent
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.520]  and been too silent too long I agree with you but what do we do when the the
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.720]  Liberty lovers of all race color and creeds start getting involved and start
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:35.560]  saying no and start voting out the bad guys then the social engineers will
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:40.120]  simply stage terror attacks and blame it on us we have to be ready for that to
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.960]  expose these false flags I want your take on that pastor but in your gut
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.800]  because you made a lot of predictions on this show I think the first time you
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.200]  came on was actually six seven eight years ago because it was at the other
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.000]  studio I've been here for about six seven years you made a lot of predictions
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.520]  even when Obama was running that he would do all this and quite frankly I kind
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.640]  of rolled my eyes as I said earlier at first thinking it was a little too much
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.120]  I mean I agree with a lot of what you were saying but some of it I thought
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.320]  was sensational but reality always tends to be more sensational than what we can
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.000]  even dream up so you've been right so far what's coming next what do you see
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.040]  Obama doing in his last two years well I can tell you this that we are we're
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.680]  gonna have a very difficult time here in America mainly because Obama has
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:29.520]  neutered the Republican conservative establishment I mean if you talk about
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.200]  Mitch McConnell or John Banner if you're looking politically at our nation they
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:42.240]  have been neutered they have no power he has empowered those of the neural order
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:51.680]  in terms of raising the stock market from 8,000 in December of 2007 to 18,000
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.800]  points in December of 2014 I'm sorry 2008 that's what a stock
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:02.600]  yes a giant bubble the biggest ever right so the wealthier are getting
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:09.560]  wealthier and people will begin to feel the pinch of the economics and at that
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.120]  point in time people have been getting prepared and I think most Americans are
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.880]  trying to be prudent about this people have been getting prepared they've been
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.000]  arming themselves they have been stocking up on arms they have been
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.840]  getting prepared to deal with our nation's leaders or at least homeland
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:33.240]  security types and others to defend our sales I I see in within the next two
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:39.440]  years as I stated on your show Alex going back six seven years ago I did not
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.960]  see Obama leaving office in 2016 and by the way that was just after the first
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.640]  election you'll mind you that the 2012 election had not taken even coming on
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.440]  since he was first elected in predicting it right so I don't see a
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:59.640]  smooth transition in 2016 I mean if you can just look at what's happening right
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.080]  here in New York City with Bill de Blasio his hatred for police officers if
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.000]  you can look at what's happening now with Eric Holder who's a legend have
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.040]  resigned his office as Attorney General yet he's still there if you can look at
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.360]  what is being fermented in the streets all over this nation lawlessness is
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:24.320]  being form into the industry so I I can't imagine another 12 months of this
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:31.320]  without us having to hunker down and recognize it's us against them and I
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:36.560]  think that us is going to be greater than them and the other thing is you know
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.040]  there's old biblical inside old but it's a biblical teaching Alex that when
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:50.520]  Pharaoh was the dictator of Egypt and was oppressing the people worldwide he had
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:56.320]  as his servants there the Jewish people and they were giving birth and young
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.880]  boys and growing in power and influence and Pharaoh became afraid of what the
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:07.280]  Jews would ultimately become in terms of they're having power and to align
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.780]  themselves with other nations I'm used and so he began to kill off all the the
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:16.680]  males that were born somehow know another Moses escape what I want to use in
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:22.600]  that example is this is that Obama is no fool and the people he serves or works
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:27.080]  for are not fools either they're looking at the tea leaves they're listening to
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:31.760]  you every day they know what you're saying and that date and they know that
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.120]  tens of millions of people are listening to you every day do you think they're
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.920]  going home and so we're not paying attention to Alex Jones we're not
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.960]  paying any attention to anything he said no that's not what they're doing they
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.280]  are getting ready when they feel that at some point there's been a tipping point
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:53.840]  and the people are now ready to rise up and demonstrate they are the majority
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:29:00.640]  with absolute power before that moment dawns I believe you're gonna see the
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.680]  kind of activity that went on in Boston with the so-called alleged Boston
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:10.480]  bombing whereas whole cities will be shutdowns planes will not fly trains
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.960]  will not roll buses and food supplies will not come in I think in fact I'm
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.760]  sure that's what they're gonna do to try to prevent or preempt what is
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.440]  inevitable in our nation I agree let's talk about that the type of false flags
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.600]  they're gonna pull to try to bring all this in and it's not just the Alex Jones
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.800]  show there are hundreds of shows a lot of millions of listeners like yours that
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.960]  are reaching out to people and there's so many voices now that get it I don't
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.240]  see how they could imprison a David Manning or a Joseph Farrah and Alex
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.040]  Jones or a Matt Drudge or the thousands of other prominent people they just can't
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:52.720]  stop the signal the words out we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.160]  involved George Soros gave a speech six months ago saying he was commanding it
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:10.160]  the State Department came out and said they spent five billion to do it we had
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:17.800]  video of the US ambassador to the UN saying it Oliver Stone says the sun
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:23.680]  comes up in the morning oh that's really radical and again they're not trying to
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.800]  overthrow Ukraine to put something better and they're looting it they gave
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:35.200]  Joe Biden's son control of like a 14 billion dollar company and he has a big
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:39.280]  ownership stake in it that comes up with several billion his kids right out of
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.440]  college they went and sees a whole bunch of areas that are controlled by the
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.400]  Russians and says it's says it belongs to their kid now and the Russians built
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.120]  it the infrastructure that feeds into his gas company that then distributes it
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:59.720]  I mean what a joke why did you just make Joe Biden son the king of Ukraine that's
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.720]  the type of all-out corruption we're seeing right now I'm gonna get to that
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.720]  the moment go back to Pastor Manning your questions or comments for Pastor
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.280]  Manning here's the toll-free number what do you think about what he's saying I
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:15.200]  think it's spot-on and when I'm underestimate something I'm the first
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.720]  to admit I'm usually dead on and super accurate but I know there's a communist
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.560]  inlay in this and the global issues communism is a control arm but really
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:30.840]  they're crony capitalist monopoly men deep pockets as Pastor Manning was
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.840]  saying but really the communists end up double-crossing the bankers all the time
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.120]  they really want to have a communist takeover it's communist tactics kill
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:46.560]  the police just the most violent bring down the society destabilize cut off the
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:52.640]  food 80 plus million people died when Mao did this in China I mean this is
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:58.040]  serious dangerous stuff okay notice Homeland Security isn't for the

[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.080]  patriots while the Democrats activate folks to go out and start burning stuff
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:11.760]  and killing people it's so obvious and then the cops go I guess we goober

[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.440]  Pastor James David Manning of ockla.org where you can find his radio and
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:53.600]  TV show and see all his predictions of seven eight years ago when he really
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  started going nationwide at that point he had just been focused on trying to
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.000]  reform Harlem and trying to reach out to folks there but he said that he saw
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.280]  Obama as such a threat and so evil to tear the country apart and start race
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.560]  war and all the rest of it that he started coming out against him and going
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:16.800]  nationwide and he joins us now I want to go to some phone calls at 800-259-9231
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.080]  as well specifically for our guest but Pastor you've got the floor I've been
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.240]  asking the questions here I want you to finish up with some of the false flags
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.760]  what you think they may pull to try to counter us to shut down and lock down
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.520]  cities which is clearly being prepared and then what comes after that and then
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:39.440]  other big topics that you're looking at and covering right now well I can tell
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.800]  you now the continuation of pushing the the envelope of lawlessness in the
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.840]  streets lawlessness and riotous behavior towards police officers and
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:57.640]  authority figures and promoting where there enough time left to put lawless
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.200]  anti-police types in government and then of course you got to be quite
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:07.840]  discerning because most of these people in politics are it's most of them are
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.480]  liberals and in their mindset if they're not by the time they get there they
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.240]  become co-opted but let me just say this Alex before I can move further I've
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:21.480]  launched a campaign here in New York City to take down race pimp Al Sharpton and
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.840]  I want to take just a few moments to talk about that if I can't you've got the
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.520]  floor in fact I meant to get to Al Sharpton let's talk about the FBI rat
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:33.600]  demon who helped set people up and who loves the fact that half the black folks
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.000]  I mean not even Pharaoh could get that done with the Israelites he couldn't
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.920]  kill half their sons half of the black people in this country have not been
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.200]  born and I guess he just thinks that's a great thing so tell us about Al
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:51.440]  Sharpton well I've launched a campaign to demand that MSNBC fires our Sharpton
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:59.400]  and we're starting a national movement to boycott all the advertisers of MSNBC
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:05.360]  until they fire Al Sharpton he's a known race baiter he's got no business being
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:12.920]  on MSNBC I Al Sharpton did not pull the trigger on a large number of deaths that
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.360]  are associated with his protest marches over the past 20 years he has been
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.480]  convicted in court in court as a liar and a hoax starter in the Tawana
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.760]  brawler event going back a few decades ago and was fined $380,000 that he
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.200]  never paid there was a fire here on a Freddy's fashion mark a store just three
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.000]  blocks from where I now sit on 125th Street here in Harlem where Al Sharpton
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  had a protest out in front of the store because trying to get black businesses
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  in and move other businesses out where he coined the phrase the interloper after
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.440]  that event Al Sharpton left two hours later one of the persons that was in
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:42:00.240]  that protest and disciples of Al Sharpton came in pulled a gun on the people in
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.200]  the store forced them down into the basement sprinkled lighter fluid on the
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.640]  clothing that was there touched a place eight people died the deaths of those
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:12.280]  young people is on the hands of Al Sharpton no actions were taken against him
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:19.840]  I've asked people to stand with me to boycott the advertisers of MSNBC until
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.840]  Al Sharpton has been fired by MSNBC has the lowest cable ratings I mean probably
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.200]  while you were asleep Alex you got more people here in New York listening to you
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:38.840]  than MSNBC has nationwide Al Sharpton is a liability and I believe
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:46.280]  Alex that we can take Al Sharpton down and in doing so we'll have a victory over
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.360]  Obama and over these powers that are trying to destroy us and I think it's
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.680]  imperative that people unite with me boycott the advertisers we've got a
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.800]  statement up on our website we posted up on YouTube and we've got a list of the
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:07.000]  advertisers that should be boycotting against including General Electric that
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.160]  owns MSNBC but we're also going to take out a full-page ad in the Wall Street
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:18.880]  Journal calling for this boycott until Al Sharpton is gone it's a great idea I
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:22.320]  want to talk about it more but let's not forget he lobbies to raise taxes on
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:26.520]  rich people poor people he loves Obamacare that raised seven taxes on poor
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.400]  people including payroll taxes and he hasn't paid millions in taxes and
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:37.680]  doesn't get in trouble for it he's above the law why do you think that is five
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:43.840]  point four million dollars is what Al owes at this present moment he says he's
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.760]  worked out some sort of an agreement with the government on a payback schedule
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.760]  but I can tell you now he's not going to pay the money first of all because he
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.880]  doesn't have it but secondly nothing is going to have I've talked to people Alex
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.480]  who have the understanding of the tax structure people who are leaders political
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:06.400]  politically they've all agreed not one person has differed in their opinion the
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:11.400]  government Obama the federal government the IRS is not going to do one thing to
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.200]  Al Sharpton in terms of his owing of those taxes and he's never going to pay
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.320]  them but yet he insists on taxes being raised on everybody else that's what
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.160]  that's gonna go it is unbelievable it'd be one thing if he was against taxes and
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.920]  was dodging them but he just promotes higher taxes and doesn't pay him no he's
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.280]  not going to pay it he's not going to pay and I well I'll go ahead and share this
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.840]  on your broadcast we are presently doing an investigation to see whether or not
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:45.680]  Al Sharpton is operating under a 501c3 which is a charitable religious
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:52.040]  organization which his organization is not and only the 501c3 organization
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.720]  which many people involve themselves in and Al Sharpton I believe has done it we
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.520]  have not been able to conclude what the findings are but we suspect that he's
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:05.840]  doing it and if he's doing it he's doing it illegally because you can't make a
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:13.560]  donation to an organization and get a tax exempt status unless 501c3 501c4
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:19.520]  501c whatever will not allow a tax rebate so we believe and we're going
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.760]  after that tax issue with Al Sharpton as well and as soon as I get the word I'd
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.800]  like to come back on your broadcast and let you know please give us an update you
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.880]  let us know because this is a great idea I mean it's time to bring him down as a
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.400]  message to everybody because he's been working for the national elements of the
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:42.280]  feds all along to destabilize things and create just mindless racial hatred that's
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:47.640]  not gonna rest I'm sorry he's a snitch no go ahead the man's a snitch he's been
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.560]  working for the federal government he's a known drug dealer in order to raise
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:58.040]  money at a time when his income was very low he's took to setting drugs with
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:02.920]  the mafia and and people within the Harlem community so he needs to come
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:07.680]  down he needs to go I think people need to see this it needs to send a message
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.520]  that there's a power out there that will not tolerate and as you know he's been
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:18.840]  to the White House 85 times Alex imagine that Al Sharpton in the White
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:26.280]  House at dinners and special occasions private sessions 85 times with Barack
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:30.720]  Obama he needs to go he needs to go well that shows me right there that Reverend
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.560]  Wright and Reverend Sharpton and Reverend Obama is all calling I mean that shows
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:40.160]  it's not just a communist act they just love they just love it I mean they must
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.800]  love Sharpton and all the evil he is so nasty
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.720]  selling drugs to his own people promoting abortion creating demonstrations
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:56.040]  they burn people up and then and then why would MSNBC hire such an evil openly
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:01.160]  evil person with a record like that because Obama said that they that they
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:08.720]  should and they did thinking that that would give them access to Obama make
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:17.120]  him privy to breaking news events and they also calculated Alex that Americans
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:23.560]  would be afraid to be called races if they raised an issue about MSNBC
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:29.600]  hiring our Sharpton they put they counted on that and they counted well but
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.800]  that's why they did it that's how they did it I'll make a prediction their
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.760]  ratings swamp would end if they put you on two times a day or myself or anybody
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.640]  else with commentary even their own people would tune in to hear the debate
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:47.480]  there's no debate on that channel it is a bunch of lies and garbage so it almost
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:50.760]  doesn't matter because they almost have no viewers what do you think they're
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:57.320]  going to do as socialist New World Order race-baiting media dies are they just
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:02.400]  kind of keep it on air as a facade as I as I stand before the Lord as I talked
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.840]  to you Alex as well they're gonna get rid of our shop first they're gonna dig
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.840]  in their heels heels they're not gonna take it seriously or they're gonna try
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.520]  and to give him some cover and possibly try to make some deal with me no deals
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:22.080]  will be made I'm not a sellout I'm not a trader our Sharpton must go he's killing
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.040]  his own people he's a drug dealer to his own people he's promoting abortion he's
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.840]  promoting destruction there is nothing that anyone can offer me to stop me to
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.280]  get me off of this pass he must go you know what scummy is in Harlem I mean I'm
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.720]  surprised he can walk up and down the street well you got a lot of scum in
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.640]  Harlem and I don't mean that to be a blanket statement about everybody here
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:47.640]  you got Charles Rangel here so he's kind of king of the scum then no I mean for
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.640]  the scum you know for the minority of folks that are bad and who think thug life
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.920]  is cool in Harlem who is the king who is the king rat you got a lot you got a
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.240]  lot of racist people in Harlem but black people are racist I mean they are they
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:06.480]  are hell bent on races they're getting more races but right now Sharpton is
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.880]  king he's king so he is the king no he's king no no doubt about nobody's coming
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.680]  closer he's king so Hitler was king of the Nazis Stalin was king of the Russian
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:20.520]  Communists that El Castro is the king of Cuba would you say the king of Harlem is
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.480]  El Sharpton I am fanically no doubt about it he is and he's undisputed he's
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:30.720]  unchallenged as the king of Harlem and for most black people nation world and
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.640]  nationwide yeah that's right that's absolutely correct so if you promote
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.280]  killing 52% of black people before they're born and you sell drugs to black
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:44.480]  people and then set them up for the FBI you're a hero I had a conversation on the
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:48.040]  phone last night with someone I was discussing this very issue of taking
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.080]  down Al Sharpton and the history said to me he said pastor there's an old saying
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.720]  if you go after the king make sure you kill him because if you let him live
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.120]  he'll he's gonna come back for you so the fact that you've raised the fact that
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:07.320]  he wears though he's the monarchy he wears wears the crown here in Harlem and
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:12.200]  that this person referred to him as king and he is king no he is obviously and I
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:14.560]  was getting to this next we're going to break come back with a few segments of
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:19.120]  calls that's what I'm saying you're in the middle of Harlem with your successful
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.520]  church helping people folks need to pray for you you obviously didn't bring it up
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:27.440]  that's dangerous this guy is a thug is a gangster what he is is a mafia chief in
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.120]  my view and that's why Obama met with him 88 times so people need to pray for
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.200]  you because you're a warrior for truth in his camp yeah I mean in his in his
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:39.800]  kingdom you are going up against him in his face you're not sitting down here
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.640]  in Texas doing it like I am you are going up against him right in his own
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:48.480]  devil nest and God bless you for it fortune favors the bold and the fortune
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:52.120]  that pastor man he's looking for is freedom for his people and everybody

[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:11.080]  Manning is our guest I want to go to calls here but and I'm not trying to
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:14.680]  lionize either I say that a lot but I mean I I'm not just saying it for hype
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:18.920]  that Pastor Manning has a lot of courage I've been to Harlem a few times
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.680]  been to New York many times but from what I've read and heard if you shoot your
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:28.560]  mouth off about Al Sharpton or others some bad things can happen I mean he is a
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:33.880]  thug he is tied into the mafia the FBI Obama so we need to recognize your
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:39.520]  courage calling for the boycott and his firing of this monstrous king of the
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.760]  pimps in fact we're gonna have it we're gonna name this video today what should
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:50.040]  we name it Pastor Manning Al Sharpton King of the pimps Al Sharpton well I
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  said Al Sharpton King of you can call it pimp's king of races king of the scum
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:04.440]  either one of those who work all right we'll go with king of the scum
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:09.440]  well if you're gonna go after the king you might as well go after him huh no
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.240]  points half-stepping on this it's either all or nothing so when I take all in
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:16.520]  this one Alex well what do you expect when I go to break and come back with
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.920]  Steve and all the callers but what in your gut because I agree he's ripe to
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:24.560]  fall you just are kind of the wind that blows through and knocks him over if
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:28.040]  people get behind you and I think they will the Twitter and Facebook campaign
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.920]  we're gonna get behind this with you pastor and get some articles out and
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.320]  have you back next week what are you expecting and what type of stuff have
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:37.160]  you heard happen I mean I mean we know people get burned up in their house and
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.040]  stuff like that when Sharpton doesn't like them but what else have you heard
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:45.920]  might happen to you well I I have had Sharpton agitators and infield traders
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.840]  in our church worship services they've come to some of our town hall style
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.160]  meetings in fact a couple of them that actually became members of our church to
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.680]  some degree so I've been infiltrated by the Sharpton and the Rangel crowd for
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.800]  some time and so you end up waking them up excuse me no well no they can they
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:12.400]  came to try to find out exactly what I was doing where I was vulnerable to see
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.680]  where the weak spots were you saying that you were able to get some of them
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.240]  to wake up yeah of course and that's and that's why I want to go next thanks for
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:25.080]  saying that because as a result of what I'm doing the standard I've taken a
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:31.040]  number of people in the community have come to me privately and said to me just
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.800]  keep doing what you're doing we are with you they don't want to take a public
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.360]  stand right now because they don't know that I'm going to succeed but they are
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:46.080]  they want me to know that they are with me and encouraging me and I and should I
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:50.040]  have a need I believe they're going to be there I believe people are just
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.760]  waiting to see someone take down this king of the scum and and then they can
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:58:00.040]  come out and shout and stand and align themselves with me and Alex I tell you if
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:04.720]  I get that opportunity to have that kind of leadership you're going to see a
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:10.480]  fresh breeze blow through America nationwide and I'm asking people to
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:15.440]  please pray with me that we get an opportunity to refresh America by taking

[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:27.000]  got to have faith pray about it but take that first step and so we've

[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:42.840]  him on about how the system's trying to stir up division and race war and how out
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:46.280]  of control it's getting and then it pretty much legitimizes any real police
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.200]  brutality because then it makes anybody who's against police brutality look like
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:54.520]  a cop killer so sick we're taking your phone calls pastor mannings with us
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.400]  right now Steven in Florida thanks for holding you're on the air next we'll
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:03.680]  go to Tamika go ahead yeah good afternoon and Merry Christmas and
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.120]  Happy New Year I just wanted to say something to get pastor manning's
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:12.760]  responses there's a lot of reasons why America's in the shape it's in but as a
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:19.000]  Bible-believing christian for almost 36 years now I think I can safely say that
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.440]  the main reason America is going in the direction it is is because Christianity
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:29.640]  in America has become such a joke it is no threat to the devil and its forces and
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.000]  we're powerless to stop what's going on. I agree that's what I got to earlier they
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:39.040]  have all these fake preachers like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and but then
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:42.680]  they've got them on the you know Republican side as well that just go along
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:45.880]  with the system and they just preach a religion of going along with the system
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:50.840]  whereas you have pastor manning who's right there in Harlem having an effect
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:54.640]  for decades feeding the poor saving people and getting in the face of the
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.760]  drug dealers getting in the face and it's not cool to be scum it's not cool to
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:04.360]  be thugs it's not cool to want to kill cops and he's there and now going up
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:07.480]  against Al Sharpton let me get his take on this what do you say to what Steve
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:12.280]  saying Steve is absolutely right the foundation of our nation and the
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:17.000]  foundation of our future lies in the strength of the church but the church
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.080]  has been neutered it has been castrated and we've got all these phony false
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:26.680]  prophets standing in these pulpit these panty waste lollipop if you will
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:30.800]  preachers preaching these syrupy sermons without the strength and so
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:37.320]  therefore we have the problems that we have in America now and we're not going
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:40.200]  to be able to take America back through any kind of a political movement
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:45.080]  without the power of the church first standing up and bringing us back to our
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:51.080]  moral and Christian stance so Steve is absolutely right if we if we if we
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:56.200]  overlook the fact that the church has not played the role as it should
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:01.320]  biblically scripturally then if we overlook that then we're never going to
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:05.960]  see that's why I believe that God's got me in Harlem as a pastor for 30 years
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:11.160]  Alex I've been in 33 years in Harlem as a preacher and I'm not turned to the
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:16.000]  right nor to the left I've been offered opportunities to sell out and you know
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.840]  and do all kinds of things with Fox News and all that I've turned it all down
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.320]  because I recognize that once I lose my soul and my connect and my ability and
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:29.720]  integrity to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ I have absolutely
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:34.040]  nothing I've never heard our shop to say Jesus has anybody out there in the
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:39.040]  audience ever heard this man say Jesus he's never said it I never heard Jesse
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.320]  say it but it may have but might have but I've never heard him use the name
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:48.480]  Jesus or the word well look at Reverend right it's classic liberation theology
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.840]  communist garbage it's just so sad because then it creates racism it's the
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.520]  opposite of what Martin Luther King taught that I totally agree with judge a
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:00.920]  person on the character and their deeds and what they stand for judge a tree by
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.480]  the fruits quoting Christ they do the opposite they say judge somebody by their
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:10.160]  skin color they listen it's I've been preaching for quite some time how this
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.480]  church mother who had been in this church for 20 years when I stood up
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.480]  against Obama back in 2008 Alex she left the church I called her and I ask her
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.440]  why and she said because you're not for Obama I said but he's not a Christian
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:29.360]  it's anybody in Jeremiah right church for 20 years and she knows what it is to
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.680]  be a member of a church you've got to agree with their policies their belief
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:36.920]  their thinking and I says he believes in killing babies in the womb he even said
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:41.040]  he would want his own daughter to kill his grandchild in the womb how could you
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:48.280]  as a Christian be for him she said but he's black past the man he's black and
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.640]  we black people got to stick together I've never heard anything it's horrible
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:55.360]  yeah well you stick together not killing all your babies we'll be right back stay

[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:35.840]  see think of all those children in the womb no all they want is their mother
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:41.040]  and father to stand by them why is it even debated that we shouldn't be
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:44.960]  aborting children especially in the second and third trimester instead of
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:49.120]  promoting it like it's an activist thing to do you know an active your
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:53.600]  selfishness to kill your child and use the very rare excuse of rape as a
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:59.000]  reason to say it's okay and then people like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson push
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.440]  it and say it's good and Planned Parenthood is part of getting folks out
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:08.760]  to demonstrate to create racial division saying black lives matter when they are
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:12.840]  the group set up to exterminate black people by Margaret Sanger and Adolf
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:17.040]  Hitler set up his model off of Margaret Sanger I don't want to digress off into
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:22.720]  that anymore it just makes me really get upset by how evil these social
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:27.720]  engineers are I want to go to Frank Tamika Larry Corey and Rich before
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.160]  Pastor Manning leaves us at 20 after so let's go quickly to the calls let's talk
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:37.720]  to Frank in North Carolina you're on the air with Pastor Manning go ahead hi
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:42.880]  Pastor Manning I'm a I'm a big admirer of your courage since the first campaign of
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.440]  the long-legged Mac Daddy I just said two quick questions are you still
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.720]  experiencing harassment from the federal agents like you were back during the
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.280]  campaigns and also I'd like to get you take on what's behind Obama from your
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:01.400]  experience and have you seen any evidence from your position that like
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:06.320]  Alex has stated that the Jewish mafia is at the heart of the New World Order have
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.120]  you seen any evidence of that well I can tell you I have not had the experience
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:18.000]  of the any later ladder if you will a confrontation with the CIA homeland
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:25.480]  security or any of the other agencies is set to shut me up about Obama for whatever
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:32.120]  reason they backed off and and have not had anything I've not had any physical
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.160]  contact also with respect to your last question of the Jewish mafia I I don't
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:45.880]  know how or who it is that Obama I know I can tell you this that there are people
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:54.080]  in Obama's administration that have a Jewish heritage and if in fact most of
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.640]  the people that he first chose a part of his first administration have a Jewish
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.440]  heritage heritage if you will whether they comprise of mafia I don't know but
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:06.740]  I can tell you that he had a whole lot of minutes as administration well let me
[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:10.680]  expand on that the caller was putting words in my mouth I don't think a Jewish
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:16.520]  mafia runs the planet I have talked about how there is basically a left-wing
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:21.120]  communist associated Jewish mafia that's on record some of the Bolsheviks and
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:27.920]  the rest of it Saul Olenski you name it but they hate religious Jews and so
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:32.840]  it's a very diverse in Israel there's three or four big power blocks look at
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:37.160]  all the trouble Netanyahu's in right now and so again there's an obsession out
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.560]  there with making it black white Jewish Christian you know over and over again
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:47.080]  about who is behind this and who is behind that I just say I oppose this new
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.920]  world order I mean Obama's got a ton of Jewish groups against him for the things
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:56.080]  he's been doing trying to green light Palestine yeah yeah go yeah there are
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.280]  some very green some very orthodox Jews that are definitely diabolically
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:07.120]  opposed to Obama and Netanyahu so you absolutely right Alex about you know
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:10.840]  who is or who does support an obsession to bring the Catholics with the Jews
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:13.920]  into everything and it just never ends and I'm just trying to get people to
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:16.880]  believe in the Bill of Rights Constitution and Jesus Christ and not
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.760]  aborting our babies and having private property and standing up against thugs
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:25.080]  like Al Sharpton let's go ahead and talk to Tamika in Georgia you're on the
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:31.040]  air with Pastor Manning hi guys it's a pleasure to be on your show Alex I've
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:34.880]  been listening to you now for a couple of months I started following with the
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:39.920]  Hope Ferguson thing with Joe Biggs and Chikari Jack and you said earlier what
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:45.440]  would be the title for Al Sharpton and I thought hmm the slumdog millionaire who
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:51.400]  has succeeded at convincing Tim Pansy they can dance on the head of a pen all
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:55.560]  the while he's laughing to the bank absolutely that's kind of a long headline
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:59.760]  sounds like a Kurt Vonnegut headline but it's it's a pretty good actually so
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:03.280]  that from you when I was trying to show my grandfather he listened to Rush
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:07.480]  every day and I told I said you know pops you gotta listen to Alex Jones I
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:13.120]  showed them the CNN clip of you and tears going at it and I actually got
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:16.680]  that from you well you're a sweetheart and I knew I'd heard that before I was
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.200]  saying yeah you know I'm not gonna debate how many chimpanzees can dance on
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:22.960]  the head of a pen he's like do you know this statistic do you know that
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:26.840]  statistic and I had a list of statistics right there he wouldn't let me talk so I
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:31.840]  just kind of took over did you have a question or a comment to make up like my
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.800]  question slash comment I really really enjoy with you that what you guys are
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:42.120]  doing part of my issue is I don't see the men stepping up and taking their role
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:46.480]  in society that's it you know you have a lot of people that are crying out and
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:50.800]  that are calling for things to change and you have women like myself out here
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:56.560]  I was invited to run for a state House of Representatives seat and when I read
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:59.880]  they were like well you know you're gonna come into the Democrats here you'll be
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:03.840]  perfect and I'm like wait a minute I don't I don't like the Democratic Party
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:07.000]  then I started researching the Republicans and I'm like I don't like them
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.200]  either so it's very difficult when you have well that's why you've got a run
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.280]  well whether it was a real Democrat or is a real you know conservative run
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.920]  using the party as a platform but the Democrats are the monolithic cult we
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:24.400]  have a chance to the Republicans to take over with the Tea Party that's what I
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:28.720]  would do that's the best shot the enemy's response is built around trying to
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:31.760]  stop that because it's one of the few spots we can politically change things
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:36.280]  but as Pastor Manning has said I believe just politically saying no speaking out
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:41.200]  that will bring the system down it needs our passive acquiescence thank you to
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.960]  make any comments to what she was asking before we go to Cory only that she's
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:52.120]  right that men need to step up and be men again in this nation and that's a
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.600]  major part of the problem that will be problem segment number two first the
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.040]  church needs to stand up but the church must inspire men to be men they must
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:08.000]  take away this Betty Friedan the ideas that have been distributed in the 60s
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.480]  about women and not that women are not to be respected loved and cherished there's
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:18.480]  an idea that men have to be down for women to be up yeah well that that's not
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:22.040]  the way it should be it did and it's never been that way in society until
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:26.840]  recently and and and we've got to understand that the church needs to
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:30.880]  start preaching that men need to rise up stand up be leaders and defendants
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.960]  listen here in and in the community of Harlem and communities like this across
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:42.080]  America eight out of every ten households out of about Alex is headed by
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:47.800]  women and and and the men are nowhere to be seen for the most part we got a
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:51.920]  terrible situation going on that may not be that way and other races or groups
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:57.640]  but we do see the demise of men and has resulted that the destruction of this
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.920]  nation well it's just a fact I mean all the sociological numbers show it
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:05.400]  conclusively good point Cory in Vermont you're on the air with Pastor Manning go
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:10.600]  ahead hey how you guys doing I want to thank you guys for you and Pastor Manning
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.120]  for all you know the information you guys give us and the truth sharing that
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:19.200]  you do and also Alex you know a special thanks for not only do you try to give
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:23.160]  us the truth and information but you try to make us better as humans you try to
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.000]  make me better as a man and we're all in this together brother if we don't come
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.320]  together we're gonna lose everything that's why people thank me and I say
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:35.960]  please don't I'm trying to survive here and stop pure able from taking over so
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:40.560]  this is self-interest and I do care about people but listen it's not heroic to
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:45.200]  fight this it's that so few do it so people call it heroic okay now it is
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:50.800]  heroic to go up against that you know slum rat gangster Sharpton in his own
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.600]  area like Pastor Manning is that's dangerous in my view but he's doing it
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:59.040]  so any questions or comments for Pastor Manning but kind of a calm
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:03.720]  comment hopefully you guys can oh what what I've come to you know and I know
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:09.440]  you you're you're totally against this but what what I've come to come there's
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:13.160]  too there's too many politicians there's too many they're so entrenched in every
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.360]  our everyday lives in there how we there's no way we're gonna be able to
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.280]  vault these people out and so I don't believe it's kind of we will won't be
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:25.160]  able to do it unless it's done by let me just comment on that look if you stop
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:30.120]  buying GMO food it won't be there anymore if you stop going to Hollywood
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:33.840]  movies it won't be there anymore so I mean vote with your dollars vote with
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:37.760]  your actions you have power and the political class will follow just like a
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:43.360]  tail follows a dog Pastor Manning yeah you're absolutely right about that and
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.360]  we need to understand that we can't at the same time support and then step back
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:51.160]  and complain that which we are supporting I mean it doesn't make very much
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:56.640]  sense to do that so people have had to have come got to come to terms with that
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:00.240]  ideal but the other thing Alex I'd like to point up is when the young man said
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:05.080]  he appreciates what you do I think it's a salient point that you try to make
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.840]  people better you're not just out espousing a political point of view but
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.920]  you're also trying to make people's lives more enriched and whether you're
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:17.760]  gonna receive their thanks or not they're thankful because they realize that
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.000]  they're growing as a result of what you have what you put out there I mean I
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.920]  appreciate that it's just that I know how lacking I am and so I appreciate that
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:32.480]  caller he was very nice it's just that I'm humble inherently and I understand
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:36.880]  I mean I think the listeners they're the real power of the show and so that's
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:41.880]  what I'm getting at is is just that I'm thankful I understand your position but
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.040]  I also understand his position as well he's growing he's being helped by you
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:49.840]  and I want to I want to say amen to what he said that's what I want to blame him
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:53.840]  I'm very thankful I grow from talking to you and Ron Paul and countless other
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:56.840]  people we're all growing together is what I'm getting at we're all in this
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:59.840]  together that's why they want us fighting with each other in closing we're
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:02.920]  gonna have you back up next week to get an update on the Al Sharpton situation
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:07.880]  and your move that's on your site othla.org to get him fired MSNBC I
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:12.200]  fully back what you're saying and appreciate your courage do you expect
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:14.520]  we're gonna see any police officers gunned down tonight as some are
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:21.000]  promising well I pray that we do not I pray that we do not but I have to tell
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.320]  you that a couple of weeks ago a group of protesters threw a bucket of pigs
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:32.000]  blood on the face of police commissioner Bratton in Times Square
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.600]  they're probably going to be better prepared tonight I just pray that it
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:40.440]  doesn't happen but I cannot assure you that it will not well I'm skipping this
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:43.480]  network breaks we take a few more calls I know you've got to go in about five
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:48.000]  minutes again pastor manning othla.org is our guest I'm Alex Jones we just tuned
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:54.360]  in in full wars.com is our site and prisonplanet.com but pastor when I see
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.280]  and we're gonna do other video reports on this we've done this but we've pulled
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:03.480]  up the video of the groups that in New York and in Missouri because our
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:07.160]  reporters have been there and seen it and in many other areas where it's not a
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:10.960]  black-white thing but but like Seattle and other areas they bring in anarchists
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:14.880]  from universities government funded they house them in government buildings or
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:20.200]  pay for hotels for them their 20-25 year old trust fund kids white kids almost to
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:25.520]  a person and then they go out with the signs and then they go out with link
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:29.600]  back to Democratic Party groups and say deck the halls with dead cops and kill
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:34.320]  cops and mall off cocktails and they don't get in trouble that I was talking
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.720]  to some police officers this weekend ran into two different ones that came over
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:40.400]  and talked to me they're listeners they all know about this now so that's good
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:46.600]  news that the feds and the Democrats but even on a feds rip set are are in there
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:51.800]  how do they think they're gonna get away with openly trying to make
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:54.960]  demonstrations against police activity which are protected on the First
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:58.440]  Amendment and I support war I mean whether they're right or wrong sometimes
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:01.280]  they're right sometimes they're wrong I'll fight to the death for their right
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:06.640]  but this this attempt to connect demonstration with killing police I
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:10.040]  don't know how in Missouri and we have the video we played it three or four
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:15.080]  times in a New York they chant in front of police kill police kill police deck
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:19.760]  the halls with dead cops kill police that's not free speech to say go kill
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.240]  someone I mean when somebody comes here to who's been threatening me or wants
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:29.280]  to kill me or sometimes somebody who doesn't the police show up I don't I
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:33.160]  mean I want they deserve the same to not just be just to say they're
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:39.320]  dehumanized let's randomly kill cops it's so bold of Obama and the Justice
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:43.160]  Department who've been caught financing this cop killer video in New York that
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:46.760]  aired one week before the cops got killed what do you think the grand strategy is
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:51.320]  and because that shakes me to my core that they're so bold they're doing this
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:55.280]  and they're getting away with it and then I see these and when I see pasty
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:59.680]  I'm not attacking their skin color these soft Kim Jong-un looking white kids who
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:04.920]  just toddling around chanting kill cops kill cops trying to agitate black
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:10.280]  people into doing this who are desperate under this economic system and and who
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:14.400]  do face a lot of problems it makes me so angry how do they get these young
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:18.280]  rich communist kids to go out and do this because I can't go to these
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:22.200]  demonstrations because if I see one of them doing this they're so disgusting
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:25.920]  I'm gonna be honest I'll punch them in the nose so so how do you deal with being
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:30.840]  around them I think we have to go back to the sixties mid sixties when the
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:35.480]  black pack of party was founded and and we have to then sometimes and something
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:42.400]  about the communists about communist Angela Davis who was involved you know
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:47.120]  what your your your audio cut out some can they try to check the wires because
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:51.720]  I want you to finish your statement are we are we are we have my technician to
[02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:59.720]  check the wiring no we're gonna give you a moment to mess with it it's got a
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:02.120]  big buzz on it and we're gonna come back and let you finish
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:09.560]  otla.org pastor Manning you know I'm kind of ranting here today because we
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:14.000]  should be upset we're so comfortable with all this evil we're so comfortable
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.040]  with Obama's say I'll just open the borders and legalize all the illegals
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:20.320]  I'll just sign executive orders banning gun importations I'll just sign
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:24.040]  executive order shut down power plants out and then Congress does nothing we
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:29.440]  should be up in arms that's normal that's why I like Pastor Manning he's upset
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:34.240]  he's getting people upset I mean Al Sharpton wants people to be upset and
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:37.960]  you know go out and engage in all this idiocy how about we really be upset
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.120]  about the private Federal Reserve how about we really be upset about real
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:47.000]  issues how about we get upset about Al Sharpton and call for him to be fired
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:51.400]  how about we do things like that to show these thugs we're not afraid of them
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:54.680]  and if we can't fix your audio it's okay pastor I want you to have the final
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:58.840]  word we'll talk to you next week sir and I wish you a great new year were we
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:04.360]  able to fix his audio or reconnecting that's the magic of Skype he has like
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:08.800]  super good Skype good audio and then I can't tell if it's on his end our end
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:16.880]  or in between but we are getting Pastor Manning reconnected right now the reason
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:20.440]  I sound more and more desperate on air is that we're having so many gains
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:24.680]  against tyranny so many people awakening and I thank you all the colon and thank
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:29.600]  me but how much my tone your house is on fire I mean you know it might burn my
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:33.280]  house down if yours burns down I mean I'm and I thank you and I appreciate your
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:40.120]  encouragement God bless you but we're all in this boat together we're all
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:44.880]  bailing together trying to get to the shore and the we are so close to having
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:50.360]  a huge awakening it's already begun the brush fires of liberty are set but the
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:53.040]  globalists know that and they are pulling out all the stops not just here
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:59.480]  but worldwide this is an epic time to be alive 2014 is about to end 2015 is
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:09.120]  about to come in and this is the time to challenge I mean Jeb Bush Hillary the
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.480]  most respected in these fake polls give me a break this is this is pole
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.560]  pushing push polls to manipulate perception we've got to demand new
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:22.960]  grassroots people to county city state into the federal level change things
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.760]  and say we want to process we as hard-working people of every race
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:33.480]  color and creed demand tyranny back down we demand the corruption back off and
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:37.200]  if you say that with righteous indignation and the facts people in
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.880]  government and corporations they want freedom as well it's the top that's
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:48.000]  corrupt if we do that then we can have a peaceful move that can really make
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.920]  things better but the globalists know that a peaceful revolution of ideas
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:58.160]  cannot be stopped so they want a violent one because they got a chance to at
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:01.760]  least make some money and get some power off the chaos well we're killing
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:09.320]  each other so that's why I never criticized the police and the police
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:15.080]  state that was growing because I hated cops I criticized it because I knew it
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.720]  was an instrument to take down our country and we're now here
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.640]  pass your man and we got your audio back I believe you've got the floor the last
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.320]  few minutes and I'll let you go because I know you got to go but you were you
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:29.120]  were making some points go ahead yeah I think and respect to your last issue
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:34.080]  about the white kids a communist that the trust fund kids that are out in the
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:38.600]  street without responsibility agitating and you know songs such as the deck
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:44.120]  halls with the heads of cops we have to go back to the 60s to understand the
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:48.480]  formation of the Black Panther Party and I to agree people have the right to
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:51.880]  demonstrate the constitutional right when I want to do it I want to be able to
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:56.440]  do it but you remember the Black Panther started the Black Panther Party
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:00.720]  carrying weapons openly in the street the longer they were open they could
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:07.520]  carry them but Angela Davis a communist and a vowed communist fell in love
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:11.440]  having sex with one of the son of that brothers in prison out there in Marion
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:16.480]  County California then went into a courtroom shot and killed the judges
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:20.520]  out there to release one of the son of that brothers and order for us to
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:24.160]  understand the level of anarchy we need to look at that we need to look at what
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:29.000]  happened in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention when the same kind
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:33.240]  of the young white kids were in the street with their protests and the
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:38.400]  very violence if you will overthrow of government motif that they were they were
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:44.400]  using when recently as you know Obama has now began to normalize relationship
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:49.880]  with Cuba there's a woman in Cuba named Joanne Chashamire who killed a state
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.480]  trooper and new and new Jersey going back many years ago was convicted sent to
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:59.720]  life there's a life in prison but through the help of the government was able
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:05.360]  to escape prison and now she's living in in Cuba I think that we have seen this
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:12.160]  picture before we've seen this act and this mindset before as we were talking
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.440]  with Steve a few moments ago the church is the foundation as you have pointed
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:19.520]  out men have got to stand up and be men and defend their homes and defend their
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:25.520]  rights again but we also cannot overlook the continued influence of
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:31.640]  communism in our nation that for whatever reason intrigues young white
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:37.560]  folk between the ages of 17 and 37 I mean they just love it it gives them the
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:41.760]  opportunity to rebel against capitalism and their father's wealth it gives them
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:46.200]  the opportunity to rebel against this established government and so communism
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:52.480]  is attractive as sex and drugs to these young people and understanding it from
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:55.600]  that point of view we can then begin to realize what's happening here in our
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:00.520]  nation othello.org you've been on fire today pastor thank you so much for
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:04.240]  spending time with us othello.org we'll talk to you next week with an update on

[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:22.320]  Black Panther Party there were some good people originally in it with my
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:25.080]  research some of them were bad the new Black Panther parties run by the
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:31.160]  Justice Department open carry is a way to say hey we have a right to own guns but
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:36.640]  the reason that see Martin Luther King was all about peace so they killed him
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:40.480]  and then funded groups that would get into violence to discredit demonstration
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:44.800]  it's really the same thing happening over again and it's very dangerous stay
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:47.520]  with us we'll be right back

[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:27.400]  lord willing because i take nothing for granted in studio four to six p.m. sunday
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:32.040]  also be live 11 and 2 p.m. friday with the broadcast i want to address this
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:37.320]  because it's become an issue and i don't want it to sound ignorant of how people
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:42.280]  feel and i don't want to sound arrogant as well when folks call in and thank me
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:46.920]  it'll be it happens all the time on the street like a great family with their
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:50.600]  kids they're all looking at me super intensely with like loving their eyes
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:57.640]  it gets humbling i mean it's like i don't like it's okay i know we have to honor folks that we
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:01.400]  think i've done a good job but you know you want an award or something you go to an award
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:04.840]  banquet i've done that a few times you give a speech you're the guest of honor and
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:07.960]  everybody's looking at you how great you are a lot of people love that
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:16.760]  that to me i just think of how i let people down and how much more i should be doing
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:21.560]  and i really am the opposite of a narcissist um when i was 18
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:29.000]  you know i'd guess i'd look in the mirror and take man you're handsome but not really
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:38.360]  sense them plus i'm not that handsome now but um i'm just not a narcissist and it's this narcissistic
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:43.560]  society that makes me sick and i'm not saying you're calling in being narcissistic you're being
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:49.560]  the opposite telling telling me how great i am i'm just saying it's not exceptional to want to
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:54.600]  fight corruption and not be a slave that's a normal instinct i know that in the land of the blind the
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:59.480]  one eyed man is king and so you guys are trying to honor the fact that we're fighting this tyranny
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:05.640]  thank you but please honor yourself and your own family in the fact that you care about freedom
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:09.240]  and you're researching what's happening and you're seeking the truth and you want to make a better
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:15.480]  world you care that autism is set to be half the population by 2025 in a major mit report
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:21.480]  that came out last week you care that cancer rates are up several thousand percent in adults
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:28.040]  10 000 plus in children you care that they're moving ahead with forced inoculation you care
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:32.600]  that obama's becoming a dictator you care they're trying to take our guns you care they're trying
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:38.520]  to start a war with russia you care they're funding radical islamic groups to destabilize the world
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:55.160]  you're involved i admire you and so imagine being on the air and person after person calls it and
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:37:00.280]  tells you how great you are that happened a little bit it'd be fine it's just it's so much
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:08.600]  that pretty much has the opposite effect because if i'm this great i better do even better job
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:17.320]  is what i'm trying to say i don't like being probably the most dominant person when it comes to
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:23.000]  fighting the new world order on the planet i mean there's ron paul there was the check republic
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.960]  president he's out of office now he was known for fighting it there's nigel forage he's big in europe
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.640]  there's i mean there's really there's really nobody else
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:40.360]  george norry talks about these topics probably has a bigger audience overall that i do in the
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:45.640]  us undoubtedly but not worldwide and he's a great guy it has a lot of courage bringing what he's
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:51.720]  brought onto his show believe me he bucked the system to do that so i don't know it's kind of
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:56.520]  like looking out the door of a plane before you skydive when people tell me how great i am so
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:06.280]  bring me up to the door and i'm looking down at eternity here and i don't know it's kind of like
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.800]  i'm just a regular guy and the roman coliseum i'm being thrown in against the top gladiator of the
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:17.800]  enemy everybody's like hey we're counting on you yeah and it's just like and i'm like okay i'm gonna
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:24.680]  try the best job i can but i'm saying the power is with you you have the power you are the resistance
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:30.680]  you are the answer and i get it i was there praising manning and he wasn't particularly liking it
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.240]  he you know how the courage he has and how great he is because he knows he's on a mission
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:41.080]  he hates watching people destroyed by the gangster and drug culture and i understand where he comes
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:47.240]  from so i get it i wanted to praise him you wanted to praise me let's all just praise god together
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:50.920]  for the fact that we've got that spark of liberty in our hearts and want justice
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:05.960]  and i pray that i can be sanctified and purified by the spirit of christ and be a true vessel
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:13.640]  against evil it's just that i am a fallen creature and i'm very self aware and i'm wearing my soul
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:18.920]  and i know what a fallen person i am i mean if you knew me people say oh he's a pretty moral god
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:25.720]  keeps his word nice guy takes care of his kids you know is friendly tips well you know i'm a nice guy
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:35.560]  but at the same time i can feel the immense wickedness of all my generations all my race
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:42.680]  memories all my genetics everything my ancestors did old timers always do in every culture that you
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:49.080]  pass on the sins of those before you also the good traits well that's genetic memory now ladies and
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:54.120]  gentlemen and so i carry the genetic memory of everything my ancestors did and let me tell you
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:59.400]  i can feel it i can look into my memory i can see it it's a lot of it's really bad
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:08.600]  and so i think that's and i'm not getting into things about myself right now i only use it as an
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.560]  example to analyze the human condition that's why all of you inherently if you're a good person
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:19.480]  you feel guilty and humbled evil people feel great and the world manipulates good men and women
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:23.800]  because they know we feel guilty because we're aware of sin we're aware of corruption we're
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:29.800]  aware of mutations we're aware of problems we're aware of traumas not just in our lives but in our
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:39.240]  genetic line it's there crystallized in the dna and so the system tells us do what we say and
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:44.120]  we'll absolve you of the guilt so we end up serving the system okay i'm for obama care don't call me
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:50.840]  racist oh okay i'll turn my guns in don't call me mean okay i'll let my wife make all the decisions
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.400]  and boss me around and turn into jezebel and turn everything over to the state because i want to
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:02.600]  prove i'm going along with the system that's designed to destroy us so all i want on my tombstone is
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:12.280]  i did as good as i could that's it i tried but i'm not promising anything here folks
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:17.880]  and let me tell you something don't have faith in me have faith in god to lead guide and direct you
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:23.480]  into 2015 because those of us that have discernment saw this coming a long time ago historically
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:27.320]  now you don't have to have discernment to see what's coming on like a freight train and it gets
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:32.920]  closer and closer and closer everything we've all seen already you think this is something this is
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:38.680]  just the the vanguard this is just the scouts of the new world order assessing and beta testing
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:46.200]  and war gaming and market testing everything they've done so far ahead of the big finale
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.880]  and let me tell you the police are scared out there they should be they're scared deep down
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:56.600]  at an instinctive level not because they think some gangbangers are going to shoot a few dozen cops
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:01.400]  that's terrible but in the aggregate moral dying car wrecks this weekend the police have great
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:08.200]  concern because in their gut and they're charged with that so even if it's been corrupted on average
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:18.440]  it is a ancient office to be the warriors in the in the in the in the town and so they understand
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:24.440]  the country's betrayed it's almost lost everything's being overthrown we're being prepared for bondage
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:33.000]  we're being brought into bondage and it's a very sad thing so i sit here on the wall heralding
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:41.080]  as the town crier chronicling the enemy operations as best i can
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:47.400]  and for that i didn't know i deserve no thanks
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:54.200]  because i mean why would i not warn people if you know this information that's the question
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:57.960]  if you know this you should be climbing the walls to warn everybody
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:04.200]  and not thinking you have to do it through info wars or prison planet if you want to use those names
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:08.760]  help promote us whatever fine start your own organization as well just don't in fight
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:14.200]  the enemy will try to shut you down doing that go out wake others up bring people together
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:20.120]  promote freedom you build it they will come run for city council run for water commission
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:26.120]  run for student council right for the local the local newspaper start your own newspaper start
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:33.640]  your own website offer to go intern on local talk radio get on air i did it just come on because i
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:38.920]  know in my gut and in my spirit is sure as the sun rose this morning and will set this evening
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:44.760]  there are people listening to me right now around the world and the united states that if you decided
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:49.560]  to make that spiritual decision to stand against evil and ask god to come into you and to take
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:55.160]  control of you and to direct you as an imperfect vessel you would change the world more than i've
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:44:01.080]  changed it i know there are people there listening that have everything it takes the right stuff to
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:06.920]  take it to the enemy i know we can beat them and i'm mad at myself that i don't have the energy
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:14.760]  or the will to carry out all the plans i want to carry out so i'm telling you folks none of us
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:19.880]  can do everything all of us can do something and that's the epic moment in history we've now arrived
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:27.880]  at in 2014 it's already 2015 parts of the world that we show a global time map of where is it 2015
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:37.160]  right now out in the pacific right 365 days a year the planet orbits that sun it's been orbiting
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:42.040]  and orbiting for so long and we have our lives here in the middle of this epic adventure
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:47.720]  of being conscious of being alive
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:57.640]  it's amazing it's blessed it's over the top
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:05.560]  is it already what are the kawait city it's 1045
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:17.320]  Kuala Lumpur it's 345 am so i guess it's already already the next day 745 pm in london
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:25.880]  i'll go to your phone calls uh sometimes though you i mean you do when you're doing this all
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:31.000]  the time you just get caught up in how crazy it is and that governments have stolen thousands of
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.800]  trillions of dollars and other currencies to build underground bases everywhere and incredible
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:44.120]  cloning operations and just sci-fi stuff i mean we're not in kansas anymore as they say we are in
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:53.880]  crazy town i mean look at this two different national security reports and another speech
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:57.960]  by general jones when he was the head of the national security council and all these statements
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:02.680]  about how henry kissinger runs the west for the Rockefellers and how they have to call him daily
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:09.000]  to be told what to do that's treason and then here's bloomberg inside obama's secret outreach to
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:14.840]  russia they won't talk to john carry but putin will talk to henry kissinger obama secretly
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:20.920]  reaches out to putin using kissinger and there you go that's the guy that says they're going to use
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:27.160]  riots to bring in world government and he just writes books about it all just it's funny to the
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:34.280]  rubber noses in it radioactive leak at major ukrainian nuclear plant report rt should now they've
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:44.520]  come out and admitted that uh life news is published that the state emergency services of ukraine leak
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.840]  that the uh they admit there was some kind of accident and the president has said admit it
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:53.880]  three days ago but they won't now this report's been leaked just like churnobyl i hope it wasn't
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:47:00.600]  big like churnobyl but something's going on there look at this headline the nypd is essentially
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:06.440]  refusing to do its job and yet new york hasn't collapsed into chaos free thought project the
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:14.520]  nypd has basically stopped doing its job since the murder of officers rafael ramos and winjan
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:21.560]  lou earlier this month according to reports the new yorker and new york daily news the post reported
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:27.720]  a raster down 66 percent in a week following the deaths of officers from the same period 2013
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:33.480]  and then it just goes on to say the police are not out doing a lot of regular police work
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:41.560]  yeah i think new york's overly policed um i've been treated horribly by new york police officers
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:46.680]  almost every time i've been there does that mean they need to be shot in the head no
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:54.440]  no but the attitude is that we have a huge criminal city we got to act tough and and have this you
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:48:03.000]  know this facade up or people come after us i think you act tough when somebody pushes you
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.880]  you don't act tough on a tourist is videotaping wall street and you walk over and tell them
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:12.600]  they can't have a handheld camera and there's no law and then the person says well we can do this
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:17.000]  in texas and the cops says i'm gonna take it as y'all are knock your teeth out right now that's
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:24.040]  north korea that shameful but see i criticizing the behavior of particular people not projecting
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:30.680]  it onto a whole group like the obama administration does saying that uh you know veterans and gun
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:33.560]  owners are terrorists they're going to kill everybody i mean that's just pure garbage
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.720]  but i'll tell you about new york city and new york state criticism for proposed
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:48.360]  asset forfeiture seizure law this is out of the new york daily news packed into a hot crowded
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:52.840]  conference room for a public hearing on monday almost two dozen speakers denounced the proposed
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:59.960]  orange county law that would allow authorities to seize and keep cash and other assets involved
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:07.240]  in misdemeanor drug cases once the defendant has been convicted or pleads guilty well they already
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:12.760]  have a federal program where they allow up to 85 percent of money to go back to local cops
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:19.560]  state police you name it in the state level if it's through the feds and they take money
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:25.160]  when no drugs are found from old ladies so i think all this asset forfeiture seizure is a really
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:33.160]  really really really bad idea it really is just because it always gets abused and always funds
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.640]  the big banks launder the drug money for heaven's sakes so yeah i mean there's a lot of legitimate
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:45.960]  criticisms out there but you become worse than the worst cops tell you the the crazies that go out
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:50.840]  and shoot cops are really bad but it they did it though the it's the people all over the internet
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:56.120]  trying to stir it up it reminds me of what girls would do in junior high and high school where
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:03.880]  they would go tell their boyfriend that uh that they'd been dating you or something just so they
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:06.920]  come start a fight with you there's always just a few girls that did that they were always starting
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:11.640]  fights always getting their boyfriends to go beat somebody up or getting a fight or if they came
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:14.520]  and hit on you and you didn't go out with them then they would tell their boyfriend something
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.920]  that's just it but but it's much worse a thousand times worse these people just out trying to stir
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:26.520]  up a civil war and it's all a bunch of world of warcraft video game heads from what we've seen
[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:30.840]  who just think it's like entertainment but they admit that war is a big sport on television real
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:39.240]  war well you know what you actually get it you're not gonna like it a real war not a bunch of make

[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:10.600]  that have set up this nightmare planet that they're trying to force us into because there's so much
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:15.400]  good running parallel there's so many good ideas and beautiful things and happy people
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:21.240]  and then evil builds these big towers of power and convinces us all that they created all this
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:25.240]  they didn't make the trees grow or the birds tweet of the sun come out
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:30.600]  they didn't make our forebearers invent things or be bold or be strong or be bad or be good
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:37.160]  i'm sick of it i'm sick of them acting like they're the whole universe when they're not they're not god
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:44.600]  rich in ohio thanks for holding her on the air hello elix how are you good thanks for
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:50.040]  holding brother listen i gotta tell you this and if i don't finish talk to me off air it's
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:56.040]  imperative it's a matter of life and death there's a missing link that you're all so connecting
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:00.360]  the dots and everything you're naming off the devil's children and you know it because god's
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:04.600]  giving you that i'm not going to thank you you're a watchman it's your job and so is it mine
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:11.720]  if you look up jack parsons the father of our modern rocketry of jpl laboratories which became
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:16.440]  that's all he was a devil worshiper he was a devil worshiper yes he was on the understudy of
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:23.880]  alistair trawley barba bush's father but listen that's not the point they have called the devil
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:29.720]  himself to give them their marching orders and that's what really goes on in area 51 if you
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:35.000]  look up the rituals that they did and they were enjoying he was enjoined by elron hubbert from
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:41.880]  the ssi the the navy's secret service and to find out what he was doing and that's what they've
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:47.800]  adopted all around the world they're listening to the voice of the evil one and if you look up
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:52.280]  the ritual called Babylon working and what their real master is really about they're still
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:57.800]  continuing these rituals with our money and they're calling the devil himself the destroyer
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:03.720]  and the lord is driving them out of the earth out of the heavens to the earth and it's coming to us
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:10.360]  and we are mystery Babylon with the reason why you'll find out revealed in the rituals and it
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:15.800]  should shake you to the very core because we're only humans well i know hubbert did hang around
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:21.000]  with parson's but also did the guy that wrote the star trek you know books and and then movies so
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:28.920]  but but but but uh regardless it is true that Crowley did that ritual you're talking about at
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:34.200]  the great pyramid it is true he came out and and reportedly did some of that in other areas
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:40.680]  killed his own son you name it just horrible person and then it is true a lot of elites adopted it
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:45.720]  and the jet propulsion laboratory uh was into it and it's true that nasa does a bunch of weird
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:51.960]  rituals it's just so insane i mean i i just it's so over the top uh and it's just strange
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:57.320]  with the fiction anything else rich yes they've called that destroyer and that's the planet that
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:02.120]  they call planet x the bible calls them the destroyer of worlds and it's coming that's what
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:06.200]  they're hiding that's what they're hiding with 10 trails they won't be able to hide it much more
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:10.680]  past this year because it's going to be visible in the daytime and that's what's going to make people
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:15.960]  scared and and well baby here's the deal i haven't said i'm not attacking you a lot of what you said
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:21.560]  is true but to try to say that Scientology is the same as that i'm not even defending Scientology
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:27.480]  um point is it's just not it's a different deal and then i've not seen proof that that the
[02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:32.680]  Barbara Bush uh is you know the daughter of all this stuff even though she looks just like
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:38.120]  but i mean it's just so hold on we're gonna do some overdrive and take some calls

[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:47.640]  the last call we're talking about um mr. parson's and all that um in 1947 um when roswell happened
[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:53.320]  that's when crowley was there and also the dead sea scrolls were also found around that time too
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:01:00.920]  so it's a cosmic check check game between uh shayton and god but i called in last week um and when
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:07.720]  steve frail was on and talking about the alien savior and all that but i do believe i see i
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:14.760]  looking forward it's almost like i see something like that happening i it's it's i want to get
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:20.680]  the warning out there and i wanted to tell you that i am standing in the gap with you and i will do
[03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:26.760]  everything that i possibly can do and my little feeble mind and you're not feeble god bless you
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:31.240]  brother but i mean what you just hit is something i meant to talk about today there is not just
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:34.680]  evil in the world there's good in the world and for every action there's an equal and opposite
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:40.680]  reaction god wants to work through us to fight the evil in the cosmic chess game but we have to
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:46.600]  be willing to be moved when our heart moves us and and absolutely there's not just evil in this
[03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:51.800]  world we have power and and that is so profound what you said god bless you and thank you for
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:57.960]  your kind words chuck on oklahoma you're on the air alex how you doing today sir good my friend
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:03.080]  go ahead yeah i was just touching base also what rick was saying you know about krally you know he
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:07.960]  did you know he is known for making the statement that he you know did will give birth to the 20th
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:13.400]  century uh you know a lot of things that are going on in the world that you know are a lot of what
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:18.040]  he's done and talked about and i also want to talk about the strategy that you're talking about on
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:22.840]  the race war starting up and all this you know craziness happening in the world that's what charlie
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:27.480]  man said it was one of them was pushing yeah exactly gonna be the race war see how it's all the
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:34.600]  same it's devilish it's all just devil garbage yes sir and i wanted to see what would you think
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:39.880]  i had an opinion would you think that this all started from when they first put obama
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:43.560]  into office do you think that's the reason they well it's been going on all along but you know he
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:47.080]  had basically double the wall street money that the others did not that they were good
[03:02:47.080 --> 03:02:52.920]  because he was the man not to bring racial unity but to bring division and so absolutely
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:57.960]  i mean look at helter skelter look at the race war look at the menson family look at all of it
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:04.920]  it's just it's the same plan bring in a race war that'll then kill all the cops in the government
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:10.440]  and then they will take over it's the french revolution it's the bolstrik resolution it's
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:19.160]  the same playbook just bam bam bam and my final question for you is uh you know you've
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:23.720]  probably heard of phil snider you know talked a lot about this back in the 90s before you know
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:29.560]  he was found strangled to death with his catheter in his apartment yes uh you know he talked a lot
[03:03:29.560 --> 03:03:34.520]  about the underground bases you know he was a geologist you know he i had him on the show
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:38.440]  he's been on the show i gotta jump but but but yeah what was your question about him
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:42.360]  last thing too and you can answer this off air is uh i just want to know if you've had
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:47.080]  any more contractors that have dealt with these underground bases have come out and maybe given
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:52.200]  him any more info no but speaking of that nazi underground base was just discovered big big
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:59.640]  tunnels uh that's in uh the independent secret nazi nuclear bunker uh discovered in australia

[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:16.680]  thank you uh protection guardian angels watch over you and i just want to comment on that the
[03:04:16.680 --> 03:04:21.800]  partial birth abortion was a direct sacrifice to satan that was the whole point of it
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:27.800]  but you get the baby out and then they do the ritual this they sacrifice it to say actually a
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:31.560]  lot of top abortionists have been turned out to be satan instead of admitted that it's it's legal
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:39.320]  human sacrifice that's why i want to stop and also on your uh on your ordering they're sending out
