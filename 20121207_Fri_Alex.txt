[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.000 --> 00:36.080]  I cannot fail I will not fail I have got to cover all of this news that I've been
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.360]  chomping at the bit last night this morning and today to cover here we've
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.560]  got Syrian girl who by the way with her family was ousted by the Assad regime
[00:46.560 --> 00:50.920]  decades ago that's now on record that she is in Australia she's been on
[00:50.920 --> 00:53.840]  national television over there in debate so we can tell you where she's coming
[00:53.840 --> 01:00.240]  from and she is who she says she is and she a year ago came out and laid out
[01:00.240 --> 01:04.320]  what was really going to happen 21 months into this our so-called government
[01:04.320 --> 01:11.000]  banker run is launching Al Qaeda attacks and there's US aircraft carriers
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.880]  British ships you name it French the Germans have announced that they are
[01:16.880 --> 01:22.360]  massing troops German cabinet decides to send troops to Turkey Syria border it's
[01:22.360 --> 01:30.080]  on folks an incredible Western started proxy war using Al Qaeda to destabilize
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.560]  the country and they're getting ready to invade and the US and Russians have
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.840]  been meeting because there are Russian Spitznets on record they're fighting US
[01:39.840 --> 01:47.120]  and British and other Arab special forces backed by Al Qaeda in proxy battles
[01:47.120 --> 01:53.360]  this is amazing you know 2012 is coming up the the end of the world to 21st and
[01:53.360 --> 01:56.800]  I've always said it's pure bull but there's a lot of analysts saying this
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.000]  could spark a nuclear war kind of like a south of Saudi Abkhazia Georgia situation
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.600]  back in 2008 on 888 so I mean this is crazy and it looks like the Russians
[02:08.600 --> 02:15.520]  may back down and pull out and if that happens Assad is gonna run and if they're
[02:15.520 --> 02:18.200]  gonna hand the country over to Al Qaeda they're gonna kill all the Christians
[02:18.200 --> 02:22.280]  and it will not be on the news or it'll be the back of the paper like oh too bad
[02:22.280 --> 02:26.960]  they're murdering the al-await Muslim minority and the Christians on the Jews
[02:26.960 --> 02:31.600]  that were there for 3,000 years in Damascus they're being killed too and
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.320]  that's what's going on I mean it is so crazy but the general public can't find
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.880]  their state capital doesn't know the three branches of government most high
[02:41.880 --> 02:45.240]  school seniors don't know who the first president was you know they do those
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.840]  national polls every year so when you're dealing with a drooling idiot the
[02:50.840 --> 02:56.760]  government runs Al Qaeda to take over the country slaughter people it's so
[02:56.760 --> 03:02.280]  immoral and again Syrian girl her family was run out of there by Assad's daddy
[03:02.280 --> 03:14.560]  she hates him she's a Sunni Assad's of the minority yellow whites oh it's so
[03:14.560 --> 03:21.400]  unbelievable but but I liken it to being blind you know if you're usually
[03:21.400 --> 03:28.360]  impaired you can't see something and if you can see you're going look I'm
[03:28.360 --> 03:31.600]  telling you that there's a blue sky right there well I've been blind my whole
[03:31.600 --> 03:35.320]  life I don't know what a blue sky looks like describe it to me Alex and it's the
[03:35.320 --> 03:38.160]  same thing with the general public except I'm going hey this is going on here
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.160]  it's all a minute oh conspiracy theory because thinking and being involved and
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.440]  being informed that's a conspiracy theory in fact now a lot of people think
[03:46.440 --> 03:50.680]  it's weird to be able to talk proficiently and have a big vocabulary they think
[03:50.680 --> 03:56.720]  you're showing off when you use varied semantical combinations to try to
[03:56.720 --> 04:06.440]  describe the true tenor and palette of a development they think that's showing
[04:06.440 --> 04:11.680]  off they don't understand that the reality is so multifaceted multivariate
[04:11.680 --> 04:21.040]  that even the greatest verbal prose cannot describe the incredible five

[08:47.880 --> 08:53.760]  gentlemen as we broadcast worldwide reaching a combined audience every day
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.040]  of three million people or more I am blessed to be here and honored okay
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.560]  Lord Monkton from the big UN conference thrown out got the internal documents as
[09:04.560 --> 09:11.680]  usual you cannot hype up how big it was three years ago when he got the Copenhagen
[09:11.680 --> 09:15.280]  document which was confirmed a week later to be accurate and destroyed the
[09:15.280 --> 09:22.000]  global convention that was going to set up the carbon tax it was a Star Wars
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.280]  episode for Death Star destruction event and I told I actually went and get
[09:28.280 --> 09:31.520]  champagne and popped it on air when all that happened people are like why are
[09:31.520 --> 09:35.800]  you getting so excited I said watch and that was the turning of the tide we are
[09:35.800 --> 09:40.080]  routing them now but they don't care we're routing them intellectually and in
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.280]  the process worldwide and they now admit that but they don't care they're still
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.120]  in charge they're rolling forward but now it's clearly dictatorial Congress
[09:49.120 --> 09:52.560]  didn't pass the carbon tax they didn't get what they wanted now they're having
[09:52.560 --> 09:58.200]  to do it with executive Fiat worldwide so Monkton's got more incredibly
[09:58.200 --> 10:05.200]  important data he'll be breaking with us coming up joining us from the global
[10:05.200 --> 10:15.880]  UN conference that is in the second hour today amazing information coming up
[10:15.880 --> 10:20.080]  with Lord Monkton former Thatcher advisor Lord Monkton a victim from UN
[10:20.080 --> 10:23.320]  climate summit after challenging global warming escorted from the hall and
[10:23.320 --> 10:29.880]  security officer stripped him of his UN credentials and this is he is again at
[10:29.880 --> 10:36.480]  the UN conference in Qatar we are going to be breaking that down UN summit
[10:36.480 --> 10:40.200]  transforming your kids into climate change agents how they're going to try to
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.360]  push the new carbon tax program he's been ferreting out those documents they
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.520]  literally I've seen video of it they've had police assault him from behind before
[10:50.520 --> 10:57.000]  they just absolutely hate his guts he wouldn't let him into the one in the
[10:57.000 --> 11:05.360]  South Africa so he parachuted in I think we all German South Africa what six
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.320]  months ago so I mean this is unbelievable he's going to be joining us
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.640]  coming up and we've got Syrian girl hey she's coming up at the bottom of the
[11:13.640 --> 11:19.440]  hour report NATO military intervention in Syria imminent it looks like Russia
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.880]  starting to blink special forces mass and preparation for final assault German
[11:23.880 --> 11:30.080]  cabinet decides to send troops to Turkey Syria border and I guess the
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.160]  German the Germans were allies with the Turks back in World War one so it is on
[11:34.160 --> 11:40.560]  it is on and looks like Assad may flee because they are preparing after 21
[11:40.560 --> 11:45.960]  months for the physical invasion to install al Qaeda in control of Syria and
[11:45.960 --> 11:50.720]  slaughter all Christians all minority Muslims and Jews and it's ongoing just
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.280]  cutting their heads off throwing them off roofs tens of thousands of missiles
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.400]  given to al Qaeda they swear to use them against the United States and of course
[11:58.400 --> 12:01.520]  the globalists love that because they'll take all of our rights when they shoot
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.360]  down the aircraft and currently unless we expose this I am predicting that
[12:05.360 --> 12:08.840]  there's a very good chance they're going to start shooting down European and US
[12:08.840 --> 12:15.360]  aircraft and the media the the the press to media will not even point out when
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.640]  this happens that hey wait a minute our government gave them the missiles that's
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.440]  why they killed the ambassador they just had a big cash they gave to the Turks
[12:24.440 --> 12:28.480]  Turkish ambassador left and they go all right send in al Qaeda wipe out those
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.200]  special forces and the ambassador that just transferred the missiles no just
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.920]  getting rid of him of course the troops you know the al Qaeda they send al Qaeda
[12:36.920 --> 12:39.960]  and just under orders to kill him that was the al Qaeda they sent in was the
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.640]  head of security in Benghazi tall on record they just got rid of the you
[12:44.640 --> 12:51.120]  know the bag men it's what you do tell you handle it so NATO edging towards
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.080]  Syria intervention Russia says that is out right now I'm being reported by
[12:56.080 --> 13:00.200]  Al Jazeera and others so it's on edging towards intervention like oh it's been
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.800]  going on it's too sad yes Assad I think I heard him on Fox News radio this morning
[13:04.800 --> 13:09.920]  like well the activists say Assad's attacking them again implying they're
[13:09.920 --> 13:15.000]  not like al Qaeda with rocket launchers backed up by US special forces just
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.280]  blowing up airports attacking airports blowing up infrastructure TV stations
[13:21.280 --> 13:25.600]  power plants shutting down their cell phone systems and in saying Assad's
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.040]  doing it I mean it is house-to-house absolute war Turkey firing in with their
[13:32.040 --> 13:40.720]  huge howitzers across the border opening up al Qaeda in injection ports Russia
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.960]  says NATO a patriot move is step in involvement in Syria moving patriot
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.680]  missiles in yeah it's it's all crazy and saying we've got a attack or they've got
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.920]  chemical weapons that's coming up I'm surprised don't have Colin Palgo show
[13:54.920 --> 13:58.160]  some people some anthrax and say look at these mobile trucks we found for making
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.400]  anthrax they could go to James weapons quarterly and they knew it was 1970s
[14:02.400 --> 14:09.040]  because the US paid for it British hydrogen balloon trucks to put hydrogen
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.760]  balloons up with with video cameras on them so I'm also about US systems for
[14:13.760 --> 14:19.040]  the Iran Iraq war you send them up to 10,000 feet on a cable with video
[14:19.040 --> 14:24.120]  cameras and then that directs artillery in the Iran Iraq war they sold it to them
[14:24.120 --> 14:31.600]  it's hydrogen trucks balloon trucks they use them on the border here and they
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.320]  told you it was an anthrax machine yeah day one we went and looked at it went and
[14:36.320 --> 14:41.400]  looked in James weapons quarterly anybody can do it and guess what there
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.160]  they were by the way we were some of the first to break that it broke kind of
[14:45.160 --> 14:50.120]  simultaneously okay wow let me just run through the headlines here that I will
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.880]  cover in detail in the third hour let's just start here of all the things cat
[14:54.880 --> 15:00.840]  parasite toxoplasma uses Trojan horse to infect human brain and may cause
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.240]  suicidal thoughts and risk-taking they've known this for thousands of years
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.000]  that's where the old that's London independent that's the media is always
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.400]  reporting something that's actually well known like we discovered the Atlantic
[15:10.400 --> 15:16.200]  Ocean is salty but that was the old thing of witches having cats and cats
[15:16.200 --> 15:21.360]  being unlucky was because you would get the parasite which was rampant at that
[15:21.360 --> 15:25.000]  time because they didn't have you know veterinary clinics but then they killed
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.880]  all the cats seeing them as bad luck and then the rats went crazy with the
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.560]  fleas with a bubonic plague and well you know what happened the rest is history
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.040]  so I'm not seeing cats or I'm not seeing I believe in the wives tell the point is
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.320]  cats are cute cats are nice I don't like them because they carry the parasite
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.840]  and I've always known that I mean it's well known folks that a lot of the
[15:46.840 --> 15:51.040]  depression and mental illness and the massive skyrocketing of schizophrenia in
[15:51.040 --> 15:55.920]  this country is heavy metal toxification no mad as a hatter people that worked in
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.120]  the clothiers back in England staining things with different colors full of
[16:00.120 --> 16:06.320]  lead and mercury and stuff mad as a hatter schizophrenia massive birth defects
[16:06.320 --> 16:09.960]  they would just say oh you're mentally ill you have bad gene pool no you're
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.400]  toxic but the other big one in the studies and there's a new study out now
[16:14.400 --> 16:22.800]  just came out yesterday is this little parasite amoeba type thing in your brain
[16:22.800 --> 16:27.240]  that knows how to program your brain okay so a little microorganism can do
[16:27.240 --> 16:30.440]  that you by the way you know they're the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is
[16:30.440 --> 16:33.000]  studying this and a bunch of others you know why because they can use it as
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.040]  another Trojan once it takes over and then they can have a program on the
[16:37.040 --> 16:43.240]  Trojan this is called nanotech and this is the new wave the new vaccines where
[16:43.240 --> 16:46.600]  you're never upset again never want to drink again never want to smoke cigarettes
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.120]  again never want to use drugs again because it goes in and reprograms your
[16:50.120 --> 16:53.840]  brain oh oh yeah they've had that for about 15 years by the way there's clear
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.960]  evidence it's already being used on the population go get your flu shot one of
[16:57.960 --> 17:01.880]  people becoming total zombies because folks it's you know yeah well we actually
[17:01.880 --> 17:05.400]  had top scientists on who found that a year before the flu outbreak three years
[17:05.400 --> 17:08.840]  ago that they hyped so much the H1N1 that they were putting out carrier
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.640]  tracker viruses that didn't give you the flu but changed brain chemistry folks
[17:13.640 --> 17:18.400]  we're being hit right now we're entering total fantasy land okay I mean I mean
[17:18.400 --> 17:23.000]  this is Buck Rogers okay I mean but it's crazy hundreds of thousands of
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.040]  genetically modified mosquitoes said to be released in Florida Keys and an
[17:26.040 --> 17:30.200]  experiment to fight the name fever and I had to have a company on a few months
[17:30.200 --> 17:35.840]  ago about this and they admit guess what you know mosquitoes Bill Gates who
[17:35.840 --> 17:39.320]  talked about this are perfect to force you to take vaccines they've said so you
[17:39.320 --> 17:43.560]  can't escape it because the mosquito you know a mosquito gets your blood right
[17:43.560 --> 17:46.280]  they don't just slurp up your blood but the platelets it would clog their
[17:46.280 --> 17:53.960]  proboscis they inject their saliva a powerful acid to liquefy the cells
[17:53.960 --> 17:59.080]  before slurping that's why mosquitoes are perfect to carry bio weapons but
[17:59.080 --> 18:02.360]  this that's not what this company is doing they say they say they just want
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.760]  to you know have these mosquitoes breed out the other mosquitoes but they're
[18:06.760 --> 18:11.040]  there you have it's on I mentioned that for you Costa Rica now battling
[18:11.040 --> 18:14.740]  Monsanto over GMO corn trying to force that into the country even though it's
[18:14.740 --> 18:19.060]  illegal FDA quietly increases allowed radiation doses of meats for human
[18:19.060 --> 18:22.680]  consumption natural news is reporting and because the radiation levels going up
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.600]  from Fukushima here and the winds blow right into the US from Japan that's why
[18:26.600 --> 18:31.120]  they fire bomb us with those balloons hundreds of them that they'd send over
[18:31.120 --> 18:37.000]  with explosives timed in the trade wind a drop in the Midwest and blow up fire
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.600]  departments just where on they look out for him with spotters and we're able to
[18:39.600 --> 18:47.120]  deal with the problem speaking of that today is the Pearl Harbor anniversary the

[24:51.320 --> 24:55.040]  Wacovia there are the people that create the derivatives and have the
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.480]  government sign on to it so they want us up at 80% taxes like France they've
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.040]  said that's the model they're all exempt offshore they don't pay taxes are
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.240]  almost no taxes that's all on record even when they get government bailouts they
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.320]  don't pay taxes you pay taxes just like Howard Dean said we've got that clip
[25:14.320 --> 25:21.520]  coming up that oh not just not just the rich people everybody needs to pay more
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.320]  taxes and I told you this would happen you see they have the Republicans come

[25:32.600 --> 25:39.320]  and you know only for retroactive for this tax back one year not three oh
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.760]  they're talking about that and there's something about getting rid of the
[25:43.760 --> 25:49.320]  deduction on your mortgage I mean there that's another 600 billion and it's all
[25:49.320 --> 25:54.160]  the Washington Post on Monday Republicans make their fiscal cliff
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.880]  counteroffer which if a Democrat was calling for it you know Republicans
[25:58.880 --> 26:03.080]  will go jump off a cliff now now that's quote the loyal opposition then Obama
[26:03.080 --> 26:08.040]  basically calls for triple that and dozens of new taxes on top of the 3.8
[26:08.040 --> 26:14.000]  healthcare tax on all major investments I mean it goes on and on and the general
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.040]  moron public especially Obama supporters folks as soon as Obamacare goes in
[26:20.040 --> 26:22.960]  they're gonna say that the unemployment problem has been fixed because they're
[26:22.960 --> 26:27.480]  gonna count people that get cut to 20 hours a week part-time so they don't
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.440]  have to employers have to pay for the Obamacare little bankrupt them they'll

[34:41.280 --> 34:48.440]  Melissa Melton Jacari Jackson David Knight Rob do I think David's gonna be
[34:48.440 --> 34:52.600]  there David Ortiz is gonna be there as well a bunch of folks I may show up
[34:52.600 --> 34:56.960]  okay it's just that I like meeting people once I get out there and do it I
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.600]  just work seven days a week and I want to be with my children but I'm gonna be
[35:01.600 --> 35:05.400]  there but maybe watching from a hilltop okay so I'll run up and say hi to folks
[35:05.400 --> 35:08.200]  but I'm not gonna be the center of attention I really want to just get my
[35:08.200 --> 35:14.440]  reporters out there doing events so yes I will I will make an appearance
[35:14.440 --> 35:18.480]  sometime during me you know 11 to 1 or so when it's going on out there and
[35:18.480 --> 35:24.160]  again this is about you coming out with your drone your drone mob to protest the
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.440]  drones it is a drone protest and I know a lot of media is going to be out there
[35:28.440 --> 35:33.960]  local TV and stuff and so bring your aircraft you know you name it helicopters
[35:33.960 --> 35:39.000]  professional drones you name it as long as they don't fly above 400 feet if the
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  cops try to say you can't fly RC aircraft out there that's not true and
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.400]  that's what all these new drones are the switch blades the rest of it is just
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.680]  small drones and below 400 feet there's no regulations the police go out there
[35:50.680 --> 35:53.800]  and do it people do it all the time so it'll be a whole another media issue if
[35:53.800 --> 35:59.160]  they try to say something it'll be outside of law as usual so come on out
[35:59.160 --> 36:04.240]  and be part of it kicks off around 11 a.m. tomorrow and I'll run through about
[36:04.240 --> 36:11.120]  1 p.m. the drone mob tomorrow Zilker Park Austin Texas press release up at
[36:11.120 --> 36:15.920]  info wars.com will retweet it at the real Alex Jones on Twitter and the
[36:15.920 --> 36:21.120]  hashtag is drone mob and you can also find it over at prison planet on Twitter
[36:21.120 --> 36:25.160]  at prison planet okay there you go look forward to seeing everybody out there
[36:25.160 --> 36:31.320]  speaking of drone news video a black helicopter goes autonomous is that a
[36:31.320 --> 36:36.840]  popular science and now they are going to make the black hawks robot don't
[36:36.840 --> 36:40.880]  need humans anymore and the passenger jets are going to be robot told you
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.280]  that England's now moving to that last week and the cars that now most states
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.880]  are passing laws to allow robot cars and they're already saying as I predict
[36:48.880 --> 36:55.640]  shows and how they operate that they are going to say that robot cars are
[36:55.640 --> 37:01.240]  safer and then make robots drive you so the total takeover of our society is
[37:01.240 --> 37:06.160]  here and also we broke this in 2006 because Google put out a press release
[37:06.160 --> 37:12.320]  and it was so incredible it's kind of like earlier this year when the big
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.480]  journal of bioethics the big prestigious one published a report saying
[37:16.480 --> 37:19.600]  kill children up to age three even though they're healthy the state or parents
[37:19.600 --> 37:22.840]  will be able to kill children and that's actually what they're moving towards you
[37:22.840 --> 37:25.720]  know the death panels the kids not want to just kill them use them for body
[37:25.720 --> 37:28.800]  parts go ahead and gut them they talk you know there's a lot of money can be
[37:28.800 --> 37:32.760]  made out of gut them up to 500 grand on the baby parts a lot of rich people pay
[37:32.760 --> 37:35.960]  to get those parts for their kids so it's it's it's it's a you know they
[37:35.960 --> 37:40.200]  don't want to just butcher hogs and pigs and stuff and you know cows chickens I
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.000]  mean you know New World Order wants to render up some humans cloud Atlas go
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.720]  all the way so that's the plan and we are human resources as they call us in
[37:49.720 --> 37:55.320]  our face we're too stupid to know what that means and anyways people didn't
[37:55.320 --> 37:58.240]  believe it for about four days and then people actually went and read the
[37:58.240 --> 38:02.000]  journal and said oh it's real it became national news international news it's
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.040]  kind of like when we got Homeland Security and my report saying gun owners
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.480]  are terrorists we're gonna be you know hunted down and veterans of the number
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.240]  one terrorist and people didn't believe that Ron Paul's office said well we we
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.000]  you know they got called and they said well that can't be five days later
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.720]  though they actually went and found out it was real and the FBI admitted it was
[38:19.720 --> 38:23.280]  real and then the governor you know had to come out and say well actually I
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.320]  support this you know one of the states where they'd issued the federal report
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.960]  there in Missouri so you know when I'm telling you all this you know I'm sorry
[38:31.960 --> 38:39.480]  the truth is a stranger than fiction but this is what's going on and the
[38:39.480 --> 38:46.040]  globalist brag that Bill Joy and 2000 and the April issue of wire magazine by
[38:46.040 --> 38:48.840]  the future doesn't need us you know multi-billionaire some micro systems
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.360]  owner founder he said I went to the globalist you know meeting we we said
[38:52.360 --> 38:58.960]  do we let everybody just party and have fun and or do we kill everybody because
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.800]  we don't need you anymore I mean you're you've always been cheap but now now
[39:02.800 --> 39:07.440]  you're a we want the world for ourselves and he said you know I kind of think we
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.800]  shouldn't get rid of everybody oh let's try one more time to get Bill Joy on
[39:10.800 --> 39:14.560]  the show I've talked about him so much I guarantee you he'll he at least knows
[39:14.560 --> 39:21.360]  who we are the other founder of it was on PBS one time I saw him he said I look
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.280]  forward to everybody having microchips in him so folks this isn't a game okay
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.960]  this isn't a game and the discussion is being made and the decision has been
[39:29.960 --> 39:33.360]  made to go ahead and kill everybody but they've got a poison is slowly to the
[39:33.360 --> 39:36.720]  point of everybody's so drug that they don't notice half the public's got
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.800]  cancer or people can't talk anymore or people can't focus and and then it's
[39:41.800 --> 39:45.600]  just you know the slow the government will find why why this is happening but
[39:45.600 --> 39:50.880]  never does and we all just get used to it we're just slowly being trained and all
[39:50.880 --> 39:53.680]  these movies are coming out about the end of humanity and how beautiful it's
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.840]  gonna be and they've come in told a lot of the elitist you know the Brad Pitt
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.000]  types and Angelina Jolie join us or you're not gonna be part of the club so
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.160]  they're out there trying to help everybody get ready for this and you know
[40:05.160 --> 40:08.280]  I just think it's really really horrible you know but I'm an extremist you know I
[40:08.280 --> 40:11.560]  am actually read the White House science ours you know books he's written all
[40:11.560 --> 40:16.040]  four of them yeah weird and do reports on it show you where he says they're gonna
[40:16.040 --> 40:19.280]  put stuff in the water to sterilize you and that was 35 years ago you know
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.320]  which they've been doing that kind of sets me a little bit sometimes so that's
[40:23.320 --> 40:29.800]  all coming up for the next 20 minutes we are joined by Syrian girl and Syrian
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.840]  girl comes from a former ruling class family that was deposed by a bath as
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.000]  coup by Assad's father she's a hundred percent Syrian to the core and a career
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.080]  student also a model from what I've seen and her YouTube channel is youtube.com
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.800]  for slash user Syrian girl partisan so her family was run out of there by
[40:49.800 --> 40:55.880]  Assad's dictator father and she's on national TV now so her identity is
[40:55.880 --> 40:59.200]  confirmed you know in debates about this on Australian television so we could
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.360]  tell you where she's at now and she's been speaking out for close to a year
[41:03.360 --> 41:09.680]  the the proxy war using al-Qaeda has been happening for 21 months and now
[41:09.680 --> 41:15.040]  today the Germans have voted to mass troops on the border where US British
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.720]  French and others are there's aircraft carrier mass three amphibious landers
[41:18.720 --> 41:24.960]  French landing ships German landing ships they're off the med as well the
[41:24.960 --> 41:27.720]  Russians are now coming to the table because they're in a proxy war with
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.680]  Spitznets with us special forces side-by-side with al-Qaeda they are
[41:31.680 --> 41:35.600]  chopping Christians heads off throwing them off buildings burning up and
[41:35.600 --> 41:39.280]  blowing up churches killing the Jewish minority and killing a minority
[41:39.280 --> 41:45.120]  Alawites which the the Assad family's part of and here's Syrian girl who is
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.880]  Sunni but not the al-Qaeda type that's 80% you know the 80% Sunni a small group
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.680]  is al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia they're there CFR McClatchy news covered it
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.600]  yesterday with the headlines that yes al-Qaeda is leading the charge of the
[41:59.600 --> 42:05.280]  attack and now it's it's coming to a head and next stop is then Iran that's
[42:05.280 --> 42:08.560]  what I'm gonna get rid of Syria first this is an incredible war crime and it
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.280]  also speaks to the fact that the West is in a catatonic brain dead state the
[42:13.280 --> 42:17.800]  general public that our governments are running al-Qaeda in a giant proxy war
[42:17.800 --> 42:25.000]  takedown artillery being fired in continually off and on by Turkey just
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.280]  unbelievable full-out war it's not coming war is now Syrian girl thank you so
[42:29.280 --> 42:32.520]  much for joining us you've got the floor break down the history of this and
[42:32.520 --> 42:36.360]  exactly exactly I mean I mean this is so bad even though you were thrown out by
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.520]  the Assad's you care about your country and it being handed over to al-Qaeda so
[42:40.520 --> 42:43.640]  you're speaking out and everything you've warned us about is now come true
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.640]  you've been proven to be an amazing source tell us what's happening well
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.760]  thanks so much Alex Jones for the intro and having me on well you know my
[42:53.760 --> 42:59.880]  family wasn't so much kicked out but you could definitely say that they were
[42:59.880 --> 43:04.560]  kicked out of government but we're not kicked out of the country though though
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.840]  we left you know because there there was problems inside the country no one can
[43:09.840 --> 43:13.560]  say that there wasn't any corruption in the government and you can't say that
[43:13.560 --> 43:19.120]  there wasn't a dictatorship but at the same time you know Syria wasn't it's not
[43:19.120 --> 43:25.360]  as bad as they're trying to make it look like with constant torture of children
[43:25.360 --> 43:30.520]  and all these tsunami of lies as that was described by the Foreign Minister
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.240]  against the country and I think it's obvious that NATO powers have been for
[43:36.240 --> 43:44.720]  the last two years now trying in their media and in their vocalization by the
[43:44.720 --> 43:50.480]  government like Clinton and Obama at the UN trying to stir up the tension inside
[43:50.480 --> 43:54.960]  Syria trying to create a civil war divide and conquer and eventually you know
[43:54.960 --> 43:59.720]  they hope to create a Libya scenario where they depose the government there
[43:59.720 --> 44:07.560]  to install an extremist Wahhabist regime the Wahhabis are the this minority
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.760]  sect of crazies that you were talking about that have the same ideology as
[44:11.760 --> 44:18.080]  al-Qaeda and you know as you as we've talked about previously al-Qaeda is
[44:18.080 --> 44:23.440]  something that the US created themselves and something that many believe with
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.400]  mounds of evidence that is something that they have always controlled and they
[44:28.400 --> 44:34.320]  control now but in Syria and using them as proxy armies basically in Libya and
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.960]  Syria and now even the CFR the LA Times
[44:38.960 --> 44:42.000]  McClatchy newspapers I'm going to show some of these on screen for TV viewers
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.600]  people can just type McClatchy al-Qaeda in or LA Times al-Qaeda or US you know
[44:47.600 --> 44:52.560]  running al-Qaeda or helping al-Qaeda in Syria they're giving them missiles any
[44:52.560 --> 44:58.280]  aircraft missiles thousands of them and al-Qaeda was in the news in mclatchy
[44:58.280 --> 45:02.160]  two days ago saying we're going to come to America next and blow up your
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.800]  aircraft and and when they blow up our aircraft the government will use this
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.960]  Syrian girl to take my rights because the public is in such a coma I mean it's so
[45:11.960 --> 45:17.240]  obvious they're using al-Qaeda to take over everywhere it's just amazing what
[45:17.240 --> 45:21.960]  is your take on the build-up now and the open talk of physical NATO troops we
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.520]  know are there in proxy like they were in Libya and they're you know advising
[45:25.520 --> 45:31.400]  now actually invading well you know I think with the terrorist groups in
[45:31.400 --> 45:37.480]  Syria it's very funny now see after two years of their terrorist activity the
[45:37.480 --> 45:41.720]  US is now it becomes so obvious that they'd have to come out and say oh wait
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.760]  yeah they are terrorist group and this is to provide plausible deniability and
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.120]  of course they're going to probably use these groups later to maybe create
[45:50.120 --> 45:56.160]  another 9-11 you know potentially the US people would be sick of these wars and
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.880]  they'd have to be shown that they'd be under attack you know again so I think
[46:01.880 --> 46:07.440]  that it's a perpetual cycle and we can see that you know they use the same
[46:07.440 --> 46:11.920]  technique in Afghanistan they're using in Syria now by funding terrorism they're
[46:11.920 --> 46:17.200]  also using the same talking points that they have in Iraq by talking about
[46:17.200 --> 46:22.560]  chemical weapons being used by a big bad dictator you know we heard all that ten
[46:22.560 --> 46:29.800]  years ago so about the build-up against Syria I think at this point that a lot
[46:29.800 --> 46:34.920]  of it is just psychological warfare you know you see in the media stuff about
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.280]  the USS Eisenhower being off the coast but I believe that the USS Eisenhower
[46:41.280 --> 46:49.200]  is actually going to go home early so I still I believe that a lot of what's in
[46:49.200 --> 46:55.880]  the media is trying to build up such a fear and hysteria inside Syria to cause
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.680]  defections and to make people stop fighting but I don't think it's going
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.320]  to work because people see that the army is still fighting and when the army
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.720]  isn't backing down you know the army is still united and strong the people will
[47:09.720 --> 47:14.800]  be too so on the ground in Syria I think that the army is still making gains like
[47:14.800 --> 47:20.560]  they did in Daria recently and they successfully defeated a an attempt to
[47:20.560 --> 47:25.680]  control the Damascus Airport so what you see in the media of the US you know
[47:25.680 --> 47:31.120]  building saying as it's about to fall that's not what's actually happening on
[47:31.120 --> 47:35.200]  the ground and maybe this is a dangerous situation for the US because they really
[47:35.200 --> 47:41.920]  need Syria to fall in order for their the globalists to control the whole
[47:41.920 --> 47:48.320]  world basically it's that domino that needs to fall so there's a disconnect
[47:48.320 --> 47:50.800]  between what's happening on the ground in Syria and what you're hearing in the
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.400]  media I don't think we're at the point yet that they're actually going to do
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.960]  a physical attack I think that it's still at this point psychological work so
[47:59.960 --> 48:03.000]  you're saying it's more psychological warfare as they've been doing in the
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.480]  past you were on about six months ago and you you know you said that look
[48:07.480 --> 48:10.840]  they're gonna try to claim to the sides gonna use his legal lawful which other
[48:10.840 --> 48:14.720]  governments have chemical weapons never invaded never detect anybody never used
[48:14.720 --> 48:19.080]  them and that they and that they would have al-qaeda maybe launch them at
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.600]  Turkey or somebody and then we've already know they caught us made mortars
[48:23.600 --> 48:29.720]  being fired by al-qaeda on the border into Turkey so Turkey could then blast
[48:29.720 --> 48:33.640]  out hundreds of square miles of areas with how it serves to insert more trips
[48:33.640 --> 48:39.960]  in now German trips are massing to invade unbelievable and now Obama warned
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.400]  Syria about using chemical weapons threatens consequences and then
[48:43.400 --> 48:48.960]  magically some chemical weapons get used and oh we've got to invade now same
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.680]  WMD garbage over and over again absolutely and they don't even need to
[48:54.680 --> 49:01.320]  launch chemical weapons at Turkey they can just let the insurgents or terrorists
[49:01.320 --> 49:05.880]  inside Syria use the chemical weapons themselves and actually there was a video
[49:05.880 --> 49:13.760]  that came out of supposedly of these FSA terrorists mixing chemicals mixing a gas
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.480]  and killing some rabbits they filmed themselves and they said next it will be
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.720]  the other whites that are going to be gas like this so the chemicals that they
[49:22.720 --> 49:26.400]  were used were from Turkey and we know that Turkey's been smuggling arms into
[49:26.400 --> 49:32.240]  Syria so it's absolutely there's a potential to for them to just carry out
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.360]  a chemical weapons attack and use that as a pretext for intervention they're
[49:37.360 --> 49:43.760]  looking for a way in always you know they're they're setting up all of the
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.040]  they're setting things up to to attack and the prostitute media in the back of
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.120]  the paper admits our government's running al-qaeda but but there's no news
[49:53.120 --> 49:57.720]  about the the massacres the killings all of it it's just oh there's some

[50:17.160 --> 50:22.880]  people being stopped at the side of the road and being basically beheaded or
[50:22.880 --> 50:28.080]  shot based on their stuff so it's happening all over the place well
[50:28.080 --> 50:32.120]  there's videos of it they take Christians and owl whites and others up and
[50:32.120 --> 50:37.480]  chop their heads off throw them off buildings blow up churches and I mean
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.120]  our government's running the whole thing very proud of it and you've got

[55:27.800 --> 55:32.480]  look this is they're only getting away with this because the public doesn't
[55:32.480 --> 55:37.320]  know what planet they're on in the West a total decadence it is but the
[55:37.320 --> 55:42.160]  governing class it shows how really evil they are to go in and engage in
[55:42.160 --> 55:49.760]  in religious and ethnic cleansing using al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabian jihadis you
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.320]  know blowing up the churches all of it so where do you see this proxy war going
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.720]  if it's gone to stalemate and what do you make of the Patriot missiles being
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.480]  rolled in and the rest of it sherry and girl well I think the Patriot missiles
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.920]  was it's a step to create that no-fly zone buffer zone that they keep talking
[56:07.920 --> 56:14.080]  about obviously because their proxy in certain army isn't getting the results
[56:14.080 --> 56:18.640]  that they hope for after two years they need to protect them from air assault
[56:18.640 --> 56:25.640]  and the Patriot missiles a step to that but on the other hand the more that the
[56:25.640 --> 56:31.320]  US arms their side because it's like a proxy war as you say Russia's going to
[56:31.320 --> 56:36.600]  arm the other side and this is unverified reports but in Lebanese media the
[56:36.600 --> 56:42.240]  magazine made in reported that Russia's has given Syria a scanner missiles in
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.080]  response to the Patriot missiles so again it's like steps towards a third
[56:47.080 --> 56:52.360]  world war I know that in the media Russia you can't really read which way it's
[56:52.360 --> 56:58.000]  going but I think that it's very plausible that Syria now has a scanner
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.560]  missiles in its words because where else would the reports come from I think
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.080]  that it's very dangerous situation for the world to be in for everybody who's
[57:10.080 --> 57:15.640]  concerned because Syria isn't Libya as people say Syria does have the potential
[57:15.640 --> 57:23.640]  to really cause damage to its enemies and I think in some ways you know NATO and
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.560]  the powers that we know that and they're afraid of that how long can from your
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.200]  well research of you and and talking to your family who's been in government
[57:32.200 --> 57:36.560]  there how long can Syria hold out against the Al Qaeda brigades and US
[57:36.560 --> 57:43.480]  special forces well if things stays they are now it can hold out maybe in
[57:43.480 --> 57:50.000]  definitely you know and that's also sad to say because the destruction of Syria
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.760]  is going to be ongoing and but at the end if things are as they are now Syria
[57:55.760 --> 57:59.480]  will emerge victorious that's why they need to change the rules of the game
[57:59.480 --> 58:05.560]  that's why they need to inject a no-fly zone and talk about maybe troops being
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.600]  in or launching some kind of offensive on Syria because as it is now they're
[58:11.600 --> 58:16.400]  losing well by the way that I agree and when you get even mainstream news going
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.840]  why are we backing Al Qaeda if America would just wake up and be moral in
[58:20.840 --> 58:24.800]  Europe shame on the French they're the ones leading this I mean just
[58:24.800 --> 58:29.960]  absolutely disgusting and I'm no fan of Assad I mean you know they kicked you
[58:29.960 --> 58:36.400]  your family out of government I mean the point is is that it's so evil to be
[58:36.400 --> 58:45.360]  doing this and to give Al Qaeda those missiles this is GCN the Genesis
[58:45.360 --> 58:53.760]  communications radio network we have witnessed two terrible storms in the
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.320]  east but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm the most devastating
[58:58.320 --> 59:01.920]  economic conditions since the Great Depression America's worst drought in
[59:01.920 --> 59:05.600]  agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential

[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.680]  I was just reading a new article up at infoawards.com students suspended over
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.640]  American flag this country is just getting crazy they're taking Christmas
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:37.040]  trees crosses down everywhere our government runs al-qaeda they're gonna
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.000]  launch giant new taxes on everybody to pay the foreign bank Syrian girl we got
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.880]  five minutes left before Lord Moncton comes on I know you are really an
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.480]  expert on all this where where do you see it all going and what are other
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.040]  points you'd like to relate to people well I want to relate to people you know
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.320]  I think in the US media all they hear about is government atrocities in Syria
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.840]  and I want to say you know straight up when you create a civil war in a
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.200]  country of course there's going to be some casualties create caused by both
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.400]  sides you know you have the army and these ever say they're both heavily
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.120]  armed and of course this is absolutely true but the media the mainstream media
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.840]  is not pointing to the atrocities that are being committed by these ever say
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:28.200]  terrorists and because it shows that these people are no alternative they're
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.160]  not democratic at all I mean for example they got together all the groups and
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.000]  declared openly that they don't want a democracy they want to impose sharia law
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.800]  on Syria and even though sharia the Syria is a Muslim country that doesn't
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.600]  necessarily mean that they all want to be forced to live under someone's some
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:55.560]  else's version of Islam so in Idlib where the FSA are all concentrated right
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.280]  now it's one of the outskirts suburbs of Aleppo they've actually opened up
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.320]  morality courts already and they're already you know sort of pushing people
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.360]  around and telling them how they should worship their God basically and to get
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.960]  into the atrocities also this week recently they there's been video that's
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:21.800]  come out of them executing unarmed prisoners and you know this is supposed
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:26.400]  to be the new democratic free Syria that they're pushing on Syria and you better
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.200]  believe when the Syrian army gets captured and they get killed they're
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.760]  gonna fight really hard too and I hear it anytime they fight back it's called
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.120]  atrocities and there's never a discussion of al Qaeda going in on record
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.040]  and telling fathers we're gonna kill your family if you don't go suicide bomb I
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.440]  mean that's on record this is so evil well there's been so many car bombings
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.560]  in the masques in the in the in the areas that don't see any fighting you see
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:56.480]  all these car bombings happening and I think that also you know these these
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.520]  FSA people they but they're pushing people out of their homes and they're
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.000]  burnt they actually have been burning stores because they don't want to see
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.080]  stores open they want to see people striking and shutting the basically
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.840]  shutting the country down my family back home told me that they only get now
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.880]  they get six hours of electricity switched off because they attacked the
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.400]  power stations also you know they launched mortars that peaceful areas and
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:29.120]  recently killed nine students and a teacher because of the mortars so also
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.640]  when they burn but the people you know there's they're still very resilient when
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.880]  they've burnt all these stores they've gone into the areas that are controlled
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.800]  by the army and set up the stores again in the makeshift way and you can see
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.640]  videos of that on a website called Syrian news CC they it's just very
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.840]  courageous and heartwarming to see people you know still going strong in
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.760]  economy still going that's what I was gonna ask you what about the Syrians
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.040]  themselves from what I've been reading and the foreign news they're really even
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.240]  people that didn't like a saw that are starting to rally around them because
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.720]  they understand how their whole country's about to be handed over to Al Qaeda
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.520]  absolutely you know Al Qaeda and the globalists so Syrian people putting
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.960]  aside what you believe of your government when your country is directly
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.800]  under attack and your families are threatened you have to rely on your
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.640]  army to defend you and Syrian people you know no matter what they think of their
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.920]  government they're gonna support the soldiers that are not going out and
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.560]  talking other nations but they're defending the homeland yeah the Syrians
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.040]  are fighting hard against special forces of at least 10 nations backing Al
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.680]  Qaeda brigades it is unbelievable and our troops are standing by the CIA is
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.160]  there advising them burning churches and no one's ever kicked the Christian
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.560]  church in 2,000 years out of Syria but the US government is under new order

[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:30.840]  Alex Jones all right ladies and gentlemen for most of the hour we are
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:39.080]  joined by Lord Christopher Moncton who is out of all the great people out there
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.400]  fighting the globalist collectivist using the environmental movement to take
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.040]  control of the industrial world and destroy it so they can consolidate power
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.000]  he is the tip of the spear it was three years ago with the Copenhagen event that
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.080]  he was able to get the secret document that they planted double the taxes on the
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.480]  third world or right at double what they'd be on the West and then it was a
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.240]  total collectivist takeover to give 100 trillion basically as London Guardian
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:08.000]  reported also the London Telegraph reported 100 trillion in global taxes
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.720]  over the next decade now Congress then shot down Obama's carbon taxes he's
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.880]  still going ahead by executive fiat but that makes them lose the moral high
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:23.160]  ground and here's a climate depot comm report on this thatcher advisor Lord
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.160]  Moncton evicted from UN climate summit at the challenging global warming
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.800]  escorted from the hall and security officer stripped him of his UN
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.200]  credentials Moncton of the UN the 16 years we have been coming to these
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.000]  conferences there has been no global warming calls to deport Moncton from
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.920]  UN conference in Qatar and he always the reason they hate him is there's good
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:52.280]  people in all major governments and they know that massive carbon taxes on
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:58.120]  African Latin American Asian European Russian Chinese governments are
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.480]  designed to be selectively enforced and and just shut down society it's a
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.760]  eugenics based weapon system and Moncton's an expert on that can break it
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.040]  down as website science and public policy.org and so he always gets the
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.640]  documents and I know he's gotten some information now that he's gonna be able
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.720]  to reveal to us as well but first he's been assaulted on video from behind for
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.280]  no reason by a police officer he's been thrown out in Durban South Africa he had
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.560]  to parachute in and people on radio think I'm joking about that because you
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:34.640]  go find just Lord Moncton parachutes and the climate summit but you know play
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.760]  some of that if you're watching us at infowarsnews.com but the point is is
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.680]  also new American that William F. Jaspers reporting on it a UN summit
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.520]  transforming your kids in a quote climate change agents as Al Gore has
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:52.320]  called for previously so they're there calling for all this right now also
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.040]  calling to restrict your internet just the UN is an incredibly authoritarian
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.760]  organization even the New York Times admits they send in UN troops to kill
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.400]  people in Africa and Latin America to get them off their land to give it to
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.880]  major corporations it's just a but oh movie stars say it's loving you know
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.920]  if Angelina Jolie says the UN's good why it must be she cares about it she's not

[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.920]  and governments we're showing him skydiving into the conference a few
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.440]  months ago Lord Moncton is a knowledge of science and politics behind global
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.360]  warming is noted for its breadth and depth and he has traveled and lectured
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.760]  in continents worldwide he joins us now Lord Moncton via Skype joining us thank
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.920]  you sir for coming on you've got the floor until we go to break please give
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.800]  us a report on what the criminal authoritarians are up to right now
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:12.920]  well first of all Alex I have to put my own hand up here because what I did was
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:18.200]  a little naughty I was sitting in a very comfortable seat where normally the
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:23.320]  delegation from Burma would sit and I just happened to have got to the meeting
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.720]  half an hour early because I wanted to to go through some of the documents that
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.480]  were coming out from the UN at that stage of the of the conference and then
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.680]  gradually the room filled up around me and the delegation from Burma didn't
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:40.480]  appear and so at the very last moment really just very much on the spur of
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.680]  the moment I decided to signify to the chair that I would quite like to say
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:51.080]  something and was acknowledged so I said three things I said one very
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.680]  respectfully very polite I said one there's been no global warming for 16
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:02.240]  years two even if there had been it would be a great deal cheaper to do
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:09.080]  nothing about it now spend nothing now and adapt in a focused way later if and
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.960]  when any consequences of warming that might be adverse actually appeared and
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:19.400]  three that perhaps we now need an independent scientific review of what
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.600]  the these conferences were doing to make sure we were still headed in the right
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.640]  direction and that was all I said and it took me no longer than that to say it
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:35.240]  it was 45 seconds in the official record and then I got up to go and was
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.360]  immediately approached by a UN policeman there are hundreds of them always
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:45.320]  at these conferences toting trunctions and mobile phones and other bits of kid
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:50.520]  and he said you stay there and then eventually another policeman came and
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:54.880]  they said come with us and we went outside into the balmy night and there
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.920]  an enormous gathering of various UN officials appeared murmuring into their
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.640]  telephones and eventually a very tall character in a suit who I think was the
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:11.360]  UN head of security said that I would be escorted off the premises and out I went
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.640]  into the night so it's a storm in a teacup frankly and I did I've got to admit
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.680]  Alex behave just a little bit improperly but on the other hand the three
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:28.960]  things I said in that 45 seconds when I had the floor would not have been heard
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.920]  by any of the delegates otherwise and all three of them are sensible points
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.280]  there hasn't been any global warming for 16 years on any measure and the
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.040]  attempts to deny this on the part of the conference and several previous
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.800]  conferences really are becoming a painfully embarrassing likewise it is
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:53.080]  now becoming apparent that it really is many times more expensive to try to stop
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.600]  global warming than simply to let it happen and adapt to it as the human
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.320]  race is very good at doing and certainly now there is a case given this long
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:07.000]  period without warming and that we now begin to know more about the huge cost
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.280]  of trying to get relatively small changes in the amount of CO2 that's
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.960]  admitted to the atmosphere it is time that there was a proper independent
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.520]  scientific review not done by the UN's climate panel but by a completely
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.200]  different group all right let me just interject here Lord Monckton a question
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.480]  because this is important obviously look we know it's all a fraud in the 60s and
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.360]  70s they said it was gonna be global cooling by 2000 we didn't give them all
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.200]  our money they're always you know scripting it where they're the planet
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.680]  savior and you kill yourself basically or be their slave and worship them for
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.960]  it and then they'll take good care of you they know it's all a fraud what is
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.320]  the new evil coming out of this conference because Obama says he's gonna
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.320]  try to ram through carbon taxes without Congress I know that's happening
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:00.720]  get very far with that frankly because unless Congress votes for carbon taxes
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.520]  that is something that the EPA really can't get away with on its own if it
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.520]  tried it really would risk what I think it's beginning to risk anyway which is
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.800]  outright abolition the next time Republicans take the presidency you know
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.320]  it has become a monster now and the best thing for the environment apart from
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.720]  anything else would be a certain if a freedom would be to sweep it away all
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.200]  together abolish it and reallocate the enormous sure
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.240]  so so so what are they up to there you're there you always have breaking
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.000]  angelities what's the new first thing is they have agreed to carry on with the
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.280]  Kyoto protocol which actually expires on December 31st and they're going to enter
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.080]  into what is called a second commitment period where various nations make
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.840]  promises about how much they will cut co2 emissions a promise is that they will
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.560]  not in fact keep on the longer term cooperative action as is the code word
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:05.080]  for gradual introduction of if you like worldwide slavery and over taxation to
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.040]  line the UN's pockets there is less agreement and they're still wrestling
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.800]  with that but the Kyoto protocol they've managed to kind of revive the corpse a
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.160]  little bit it's a bit of a zombie but they have done that so there is still
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.640]  going to be more spending on this but what is notable is that the tone of
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:29.080]  desperation is now growing I mean they do now know if only because I told them
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.200]  that there's been no global warming for 16 years and some of them the brighter
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.840]  ones will go back and check that with their scientists and their scientists
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.160]  like ours will try to lie about it but in the end the truth is there hasn't been
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:48.080]  any global warming for 16 years and that's a long time given the enormous
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.800]  extra amounts of co2 that are going into the atmosphere the other breaking news
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.680]  is that China is now growing its co2 emissions so fast that at the current
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.480]  rates of growth you could close the West down all together and the pre-existing
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.800]  rates of annual increase in the co2 content of the atmosphere would simply
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.720]  continue the West is now actually irrelevant to all this even if there
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:17.080]  were a scientific problem because of China, India, Indonesia, Russia, South
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:22.520]  Africa, Brazil and other developing countries all of whom are rapidly increasing
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.640]  their consumption of fossil fuels in order to make their people prosperous by
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.600]  giving them fossil fuel electricity the cheapest way to make them prosperous and
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.040]  therefore the cheapest way to make sure that eventually those populations
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.960]  stabilize and that actually is a great benefit to the environment provided we
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:47.120]  let these poorer countries grow and so far there is nothing no suggestion in these
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.000]  conferences that the developing countries should be stopped from growing
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.720]  but you've only got to start doing the numbers to realize that China several
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:02.400]  years ago now overtook the United States as the world's biggest emitter it now is
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.760]  coming very close to emitting about a third of all the co2 in the world and
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.480]  this is growing and growing all the time India is beginning to grow of course
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.880]  Indonesia as well Brazil likewise these are huge countries with enormous
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.320]  populations and between them they account for getting out of half the
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.460]  world's population and if they are not in any way bound to reduce their
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:26.160]  emissions and effectively they're not under anything that's gone on here it
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:32.000]  really doesn't matter what we do so insanity is piled upon insanity piled

[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.280]  Lord Moncton joins us here on the broadcast talk about what the UN is
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:16.000]  doing getting better folks you have to understand that yes politically they
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.160]  even admit it now since the climate gate stuff came out since the plan to shut
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.840]  down the third world came out the death sentence that politically people are
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.200]  turning against them but they're in charge they don't care so how do we
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.000]  deal with this paradox Lord Moncton want to get more into what's happening at
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.520]  that conference I'm reading there's calls to deport you out of the country
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:42.800]  now I want to find out first there's any truth to that but how do we deal with
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.840]  these authoritarians because you rightfully say the tide has turned
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.800]  against him decidedly but they don't care so so so how do you deal with that
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:58.120]  paradox what you do is you do what I did you go to them and you tell them the
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:03.480]  truth and if okay I spoke out of turn at a meeting where observers weren't
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.240]  supposed to speak well tough luck there was no other way that anyone there would
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:13.760]  listen to what I said and they did listen because one side got my third point
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.080]  out I spoke for 45 seconds that's what all this is about and at the end of that
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:23.920]  45 seconds they were screaming and howling with rage and the UN interestingly
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:30.000]  in editing the tape before allowing it to go out has cut out all the howling and
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.720]  screaming and hooting it doesn't want anyone to realize that this is essentially
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.000]  a bear garden where everybody has been schooled to only believe the same thing
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.680]  and if somebody like me does get in and tell them a few home truth they really
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.360]  really don't like it so that the simple thing Alex is to do what you do and do
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.880]  what I do to get out there and just go on telling the truth until everybody
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:01.520]  realizes it is the truth and their difficulty now is that our prediction
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.760]  yours and mine that global warming really wasn't going to be all it was
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.840]  cracked up to be are coming true 16 years without global warming that was
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.640]  the message that I put all around the conference over and over again and
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.560]  finally in this plenary session where they were all there I told them exactly
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.360]  what the situation was no global warming for 16 years that's basically the end of
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.400]  the scare in any rational organization there would be no more of this talk of
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:34.320]  carbon taxes or cap and trade or regulations or UN taking world power
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:40.320]  or children as you say Alex you must talk about this being schooled to tell
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.760]  on their parents you know my parents turned on the light in their bedroom
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.000]  half an hour before they got up that was a waste of electricity and we're going
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.640]  to report them to the climate police that's the kind of thing that used to
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.200]  go on in communist Russia and they set up websites and Al Gore has gone to kids
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.240]  we played it and said do this they are the state is trying to take our children
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.240]  over while while these elitists fly around their private jets and stay in
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.560]  five-star resorts the student with hookers I mean it's just that they are a
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:15.380]  group of organized crime masquerading as earth savers it's such a joke you like
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:19.400]  bank robbers showing up saying hands up give us the money out of the till we're
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:25.040]  saving the earth I mean when does the madness end they are governments what
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.240]  is really happening here Alex is a very very interesting phenomenon it has been
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.760]  fascinating to watch it at closed courses over the last few years and that is
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:42.680]  that these people the governing elite worldwide are beginning to form a sort
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.120]  of unity they're becoming a single organization and the mission of that
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:53.240]  organization is to preserve and enhance their own powers pay perks privileges
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:59.680]  and pensions at the expense of the rest of us and we are merely now their slaves
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:06.160]  and if you go back to feudal England at that time the serfs only had to work
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.640]  three months of the year for their masters but now if you pay ordinary rates
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.440]  of taxation in America or Britain or most Western countries you're already
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.960]  having to work more like five or six months of the year if you're much you
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.360]  count all the taxes it's like eight months of the year that's right and we
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.840]  are more slaves now than we ever would have been under the feudal system this
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.200]  is how far it's gone and now they're saying they want more did you hear the
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.480]  head of the Democratic Party Howard Dean come out and say that the poor need to
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.240]  pay more to well that's the things in that that's a very interesting mission
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:46.480]  after all of them teasing Romney for wanting to spare the rich from taxation
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:50.880]  now the real truth comes out which is that you can allow the rich to pay no
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.080]  tax tax at all and it wouldn't make any difference to the country's revenues
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:29:00.160]  because there are too few rich people to matter what matters is the vast majority
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.480]  of the population your average Joe taxpayer that's where the state gets
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.320]  nearly all of its money from and those are the people that are going to have to
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.240]  pay more in order to balance the budget after these predators and raiders all of
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.480]  whom gather here at these conferences wherever there's a grass skirt they'll
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:23.840]  be there in order to find new and exotic ways of telling us how we've got and
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.880]  they exempt themselves in most these countries from the taxes stay there Lord
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.400]  Monkton don't mean to cut you off but the music cuts off your skype there we're

[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.160]  taxes because they make the rules man these people are incredible thousands

[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:26.600]  misforn little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:33.960]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension like air like
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:40.680]  the wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:46.600]  speak one for a love that thought lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:53.840]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:58.160]  think you have a strength but you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:05.440]  spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your kind resistance to
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:12.360]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:19.960]  Monday through Friday 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern we are blasting out on XM 166
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.080]  over a hundred and forty AM and FM affiliates global shortwave world

[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.640]  prison planet.com because the globalists in their own words say they're
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:44.640]  constructing a prison planet of four and by authoritarians our Constitution
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.240]  Bill of Rights is of four and by the people based on the Magna Carta that
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.040]  Lord Moncton was foreshadowing earlier you know people don't know that in England
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.040]  the Parliament first voted to not have war with the colonies and the king had
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.440]  to go in there and convince them they had to do it but the ideas that we saw
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:09.000]  spring here in 1776 actually came out of a 500 year fight in England that had
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.160]  been happening for the rights of man and here we are today if you have any
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.520]  education any understanding of authoritarianism this is what we're
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.280]  facing before we go back to Lord Moncton I want to and your phone calls I want to
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.360]  show you some articles here now I talked about this six years ago Paul Watson
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:27.800]  wrote an article about its LinkedIn and Verizon follows Google and turning phones
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.880]  and TVs into wiretaps in force first broke story of invasive spying six years
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:38.320]  ago it's already going on here is the Daily Mail the TV box that can detect
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.040]  when you're cuddling on the sofa and show you an advert for condoms system
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.840]  uses motion sensors microphones and thermal imaging this is going on all
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.560]  the new cars all the new video game consoles connect Microsoft all of it
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:57.880]  cameras to view viewers described by campaign as a privacy nightmare and you
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:01.040]  know Google won't even let you turn it off you know I first reported on this
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:10.760]  almost seven years ago people didn't believe it people didn't believe it
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:16.560]  even though we had a link to Google and a press release to shareholders now they
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.560]  admit but you know the NSA admits and and the Brits are doing this to
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.240]  Europe's doing it they say well it's okay that your computer and your cell phone
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:30.120]  listens to you even when it's off that's by global regulations it's installed on
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.200]  all of them told you about that 96 when it first started the telecommunications
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:41.600]  act ladies and gentlemen the magnitude of this is just off the charts they they
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.600]  say well it's an AI computer recording keywords checking it for advertising and
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.760]  other things but government says oh we don't come look at it unless the
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.720]  computer says you did something wrong and then that's probable cause so you
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.800]  pre-listen and then the computer because it's a computer it's okay they say it's
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.800]  not personal and then a person goes and looks at what's all recorded and the
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.040]  and the former top NSA officials have been coming out as you know the last
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.560]  two weeks saying everything's recorded everything's listened to well I knew
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.600]  that the telecommunications act same thing in Europe in the mid 90s they put
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.280]  this in with all the manufacturers and the regulations it have all this which
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.600]  how we knew Lord Monkton I want to get back into the UN where it's going and
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.360]  take calls you're getting in a brainwashing kids but they are building
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:28.800]  this Panopticon spy system that makes Orwell's nightmare look like Valhalla
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:37.920]  you know a heavenly heavenly plane and here we are it's all racing ahead and
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.200]  it's all engineered by the military industrial complex that Eisenhower
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.440]  warned us about where does it end how does it end I mean you read the British
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.360]  Ministry of Defense report in 2007 it was saying what the world will be like in
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.480]  the next 10 years and it describes the world the resources cut off a post
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.880]  industrial system reeducation centers same thing with our army
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:05.720]  prospectuses I mean the elite they don't tell the army the whole story when you
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.720]  know what the policy planners are doing you understand why they're telling the
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.080]  army get ready for this as if it's just going to happen on its own why are these
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.040]  because you know these people better than anybody you've worked in the highest
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.600]  levels of government you've been around these globalist constantly what is the
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:25.240]  sycophantic desire for hellish tyranny well what is it in these people it's
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.680]  very very strange because in the past in Britain when we were the first country
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.400]  in the world to install machinery to listen to every telephone call we
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.320]  actually did it before the second world
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.120]  the skypoint down we're going to reconnect to get him to talk about this
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.440]  this is so important I mean I have three children a lot of you have children
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.240]  folks this is all admitted now okay we'll see if we can reconnect to him over
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.080]  in the Middle East no in the globalist he's over in Qatar they'll probably
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.560]  they probably I mean they're trying to throw him out of the country right now
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:08.120]  we'll get him back on I just the person whom you're trying to read all right he
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.560]  probably doesn't know he's disconnected he's probably still talking just a
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:18.520]  pretty connecting or send him a Skype message I mean there's got to be there's
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.960]  got to be a way out of this I mean and I know what it is I see these full grown
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:29.440]  men who don't talk to each other act real of you know most men especially if
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.320]  they're mid-level executives or whatever you know think they're rich or
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.240]  whatever as they make 200 grand a year that real quiet they're real serious that
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:43.080]  it's all about their aura of how powerful they are and you know acting
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:47.280]  cool and acting strong and they don't have lives they do their business they
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.040]  go play golf they go watch a football game and they and you're not real
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.400]  people you're just programmed by the culture and you think you're gonna get
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:01.920]  ahead by not being involved you should be charging around the world if you have
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.240]  the money fighting the globalists like Lord Moncton and I mean this is serious
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.680]  people they are they are shutting down our society and there are enemies we
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.400]  have to take this serious Lord Moncton you got cut off when you were talking
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:20.760]  about Britain was the first place to put in the total surveillance grid at the
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:24.960]  NSA systems based off of please continue sir they did this before the Second
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.920]  World War every telephone call was then listened to individually that's how we
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.360]  were able to round up every single German agent in the UK bar one and the
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.360]  story of that one is a very interesting one that I'll tell you one day it hasn't
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:44.320]  come out in the official histories yet but there after we were the first to
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.160]  develop these computers that could listen to every telephone call look for
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:53.920]  key words alert operators listen to this one listen to that one so that there
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.280]  could be complete surveillance and interestingly in those days in the
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.800]  1960s and 70s it was the left who were saying this was outrageous it shouldn't
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.000]  happen this was the world being taken over by the military industrial complex
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.240]  exactly as you say Eisenhower warned about in his in his farewell speech as
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:17.000]  president and yet now it's the left that are arguing for these things and the
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.800]  right that are saying this has all gone too far has been an astonishing turn
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.560]  round in political outlook but of course the left are always more numerous in
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:31.760]  government because the left are believers in regulating and controlling and spying
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.360]  on everybody else they always have been that's what 1984 by George Orwell was
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:41.200]  all about your television screen watching you big brother is watching you
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.680]  he was the first to see that this is exactly what would come and here we are
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:52.640]  already with every computer such as mine with a little camera eye looking out at
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:58.040]  you what I do Alex and this views them is you just stick a little piece of tape
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.760]  over that when you're not actually using the camera and they can't see through
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.200]  that so there are said oh that's what I do listen 15 years ago I'd have family
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.880]  at the house and have the webcam covered or the camera on the screen covered and
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.640]  they'd say you're crazy why are you doing that or other people it's because I was
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.760]  reading the patents I knew they were I've talked to people who 25 years ago had
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:25.480]  government programs hiding microphones in TVs being sent out to the public this
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.620]  has been going on for so long and now they're building giant spy bases
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:34.880]  everywhere and they're admitting that they're spying on patriots people that
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.600]  don't want a Soviet model what is really happening is that you've got the
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:45.920]  governing class worldwide ganging up on the ordinary people worldwide this is a
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.480]  completely new phenomenon the idea of governments and keep an eye on what
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.280]  their people are doing is not new what is new is that this is totalitarian in
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:00.080]  every sense it's the entire governing class trying to make sure people like
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.020]  you and me are shut down and excluded I mean the sheer anger when I spoke for
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:12.720]  45 seconds and told those UN delegates three things they wouldn't have heard
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.440]  from anybody else they didn't believe them because they'd never heard them
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:23.960]  before they were furious because just for once one had got through the cordon
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:30.200]  of cotton wool that surrounds them and they were made to listen whether they
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.480]  like it liked it or not I didn't shout I wasn't rude I quietly said what I wanted
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:41.320]  to say and then stopped it only took 45 seconds out of their session and what do
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.640]  they do they ban me from the conference if I had said the opposite they wouldn't
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:51.000]  be what about these reports they may try to throw you out of the country well
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.800]  they can try but they're not going to get very far with that frankly so all of
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.960]  that sort of thing you know the UN has a nice little deal with each country it
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.200]  goes to that if the UN withdraws the credentials and it's the kind of country
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:11.920]  where your visa is dependent on having the credentials then they think they
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.840]  can get away with saying well you know if you're here beyond midnight then you
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:21.680]  will be arrested by the country that's the host country and you go to jail
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.600]  because you're an illegal immigrant this is the kind of thing they do try on but
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.280]  here I am still in the Gulf it didn't work and I don't you know I don't get
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.040]  worried by that sort of thing because I can play the bureaucratic game frankly
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:39.880]  better than they can so that that that sort of thing just doesn't work but
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:47.160]  certainly they are incandescent with fury not because I spoke for 45 seconds
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.680]  and pretended to be the Republic of Burma no because that was perfectly
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:57.160]  harmless and it was only 45 seconds what annoyed them was what I said and who I
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:02.160]  said it and just to add something here before we go to calls these were
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.160]  national negotiating delegates these were the people right at the top of the
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.560]  tree on this whole climate scan and for the first time they were told what
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.960]  nobody had told them before no global warming for 16 years it can't be said
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:19.080]  often enough all right I want to go to some phone calls here but getting back
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:24.720]  to the total spying government tries to make everything it does secret and then
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.840]  exempt itself from what it does to us but the answer to bring these people
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:35.040]  down is expose them everyone get active everyone go confront people everybody
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.240]  go speak at city council everybody go testify the legislative hearings any
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.200]  citizen that wants to get into these these are on the record fire the truth
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:49.040]  that them at every angle and as things get worse and worse under their system
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:55.480]  everyone's going to know it's them all we've got to do is call them out
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:00.480]  thousands of times never stopping our irresistible force and we will
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.760]  politically rip their arms out of their sockets folks if you've ever been in a
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.320]  fight and you know you're going to win it when you just click into that mode of
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.320]  I'm going to win this and folks you've got to decide we're going to beat these
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.560]  people you've got to just irresistibly reach out and never stop attacking them
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:21.320]  in little ways all of us together can move mountains Lord Monkton comment on
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.440]  that and ways to crush these authoritarian sycophant tyrants that are
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.320]  beyond 1984 and then I want to go to some phone calls you can do this is the
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.160]  first thing always use an old mobile phone they don't have all this fancy
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.840]  new technology built in because they were before the laws were passed so there
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.240]  are various ways you can kind of get partly or even completely off the net
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:47.520]  where they can see what you're doing fun enough I first came across this years
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.600]  ago when I wrote it quite by accident a piece for a column I used to write for
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.240]  the evening standard saying that I'd come across some people in the remotest
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.160]  Yorkshire Dales in the middle of the countryside who had been to say their
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.280]  pat to see their parish priest to get some financial advice and he'd said do it
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.680]  this way and that way and then you won't end up paying too much tax on it and
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:11.120]  they said oh no that that doesn't make any difference to us he said oh yes it does
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.400]  you know you have to do it this way rather than that way I said no it doesn't
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.720]  make any difference to us you see we haven't joined and this particular
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.200]  household none of its members had a birth certificate they didn't have a
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.640]  telephone they weren't on the electricity they generated their own
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:29.640]  nobody knew they existed they were running a very successful farm they paid no
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.920]  tax at all because they were completely off the net and when I wrote about this
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:38.640]  because I was quite intrigued that such a thing was even possible this end of the
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:44.520]  21st century the Treasury the UK Treasury was absolutely furious with me for
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.600]  writing this because they said it would give other people ideas so you do have
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.680]  particularly in the country as wide as the United States with lots of open
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.080]  spaces the ability simply to drop off the net and disappear and some people are
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:02.800]  beginning I mean I spoke to an eminent dentist from Texas the other day who had
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.040]  made elaborate preparations to do exactly that people are I think now
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:15.000]  rightly worried by the scale on which are ever dumber but ever more grasping
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.280]  and ambitious governing class is trying to take everything over and is
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.920]  destroying our economy as it does so but of course that we know that where that
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:29.320]  will ultimately lead yes they can impose dictatorship on us for a bit but
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.760]  then as it always does with dictatorships the money will run out they will
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.320]  collapse freedom will come back and because we've been through yet another
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.080]  round of dictatorship we will learn still further and that's the historical
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.960]  cycle and the globalist as you know admit that and they say they're studying
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.880]  show their authoritarianism will not go through that cycle they call it the
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:57.160]  final revolution of people want to look up that term now expanding on this issue
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.720]  I have found with government and other systems it's all bluster it's all the
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:06.840]  image that every spy is James Bond and every bureaucrat is invincible and the
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.600]  public's all just scared and cowardly I have found that when I want to sneak in
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.960]  Bohemian Grove or I want to end I mean I just walked into a federal building just
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.520]  set open the gate and walked in the other day and they freaked out once I got
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.680]  in there but the I'm gonna show that next week we haven't got the video edited
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.240]  yet there's like 30 minutes of it my point is people just don't know the
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.000]  power that an individual has when you know you're in the right we are incredibly
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.560]  powerful individuals Lord Moncton well I think that's true I mean if you look at
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.920]  the sort of noises I have been trying to make on the climate over the last few
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.320]  years I won't say I'm a lone voice there are perhaps a dozen other gallant
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.040]  people who are spending a lot of time on this and getting themselves home but
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.200]  there aren't many of us who are really outspoken on this and certainly very few
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.800]  who are willing to take the risk of doing what I did at the UN yesterday and
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.080]  calling them out in public and saying not come on this you've got the science
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.720]  wrong you need to rethink this the fact is that it does carry an enormous amount
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.280]  of weight of course you know I can imagine that all my friends are going to
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.800]  be in touch with the more serious minded ones and say don't you realize what a
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.520]  fool you've made yourself look but all the other people are saying well look
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.040]  nobody else is saying anything to stop this nonsense and if this is the only
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:28.440]  way to get it through if not exactly as though I'd thrown a bomb or something
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:33.480]  all I'd done was to take 45 seconds of their time and they've been there for
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.120]  two weeks already so I don't think they minded very much what they minded was
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:42.600]  what I said because they hadn't heard it before and the important thing is
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:47.440]  therefore to make sure that you write to your congressmen and your senators you
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:52.200]  telephone them to even if you end up speaking to a staffer this does get
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.720]  through in the end right stay there Lord Moncton call straight ahead for two
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:02.120]  short segments and a jam back third hour stay with us if you've ever wanted to
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:06.200]  be able to produce boiling hot water anytime anywhere with absolutely no
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.600]  power whatsoever then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:13.200]  hear here's why there's a brand new self-reliance product available that
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:17.640]  makes producing piping hot water in any emergency fast and easy introducing the
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.280]  hot water rocket from solutions from science the hot water rocket is lightweight
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.560]  extremely durable and generates boiling hot water using only the sun simply add
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.320]  water and place outside whether you're in the aftermath of a hurricane and have
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.120]  lost your power hunting in a remote area or hiking on one of your favorite trails
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:36.560]  the hot water rocket will be one of the most important pieces of survival
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.240]  equipment you'll ever own order now and you'll also receive our two hard-hitting
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:44.880]  reports peak water why clean water could soon be as valuable as oil and 77 items

[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:53.120]  the hot water rocket makes an ideal Christmas present and is now cyber priced
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:57.640]  at one half off while supplies last for piping hot water whenever you need it go
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:03.160]  to hot water rocket dot com that's hot water rocket dot com hey there Frank
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:08.560]  Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:13.200]  Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn that this odd
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:18.320]  device poses the greatest threat we've ever known in fact just a few weeks ago
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.480]  former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.480]  Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe that more
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:29.080]  people aren't talking about this it may be because the Liberals and the
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:32.840]  government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:38.200]  free video at weird device dot com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:42.800]  off the conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device dot com right
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:48.040]  now to discover exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:52.240]  family can survive this deadly attack I'm not sure how long this video be
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.720]  online so go to weird device dot com before it's gone forever again that's

[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:11.680]  information in 1985 President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:15.040]  directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:20.240]  this world-class healer now 27 years later carnivora capsules are used around

[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.120]  all right Lord Moncton is our guest I'm Alex Jones our host and we've got a
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.280]  game of parasites and taken over our society that's the bottom line of what's
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:48.480]  happening we're gonna go ahead and go to some of your phone calls here right
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:54.920]  now let's talk to Julio and Illinois listening on 15 30 a.m. WCKG that's in
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:01.640]  Chicago welcome to the airwaves Julio go ahead Aloha and Lord Moncton thank you
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.680]  for all of your work over the years exposing this fraud and these mad
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.760]  scientists that's what they are and Lord Moncton I have a question for you it's
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.640]  quite clear that you know people know what they're what they're doing and as
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.480]  of late with Hurricane Sandy or as they call it Superstorms Sandy they're
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.200]  trying to take advantage of this one of the heads of NASA wrote in the London
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:28.880]  Telegraph that now we need carbon taxes because we're going to see more extreme
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:33.760]  weather they have to they have what they call climate engineering these mad
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.840]  scientists want to manipulate the weather in their own words to help curb
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:42.560]  climate change do they discuss any of this in Doha or were they discussing ways
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:49.120]  to expose extreme weather to carbon taxes doing all of these things are on the
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.720]  agenda they're still very keen on what they call carbon capture and storage
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.520]  which has not been proven to work and would probably be quite dangerous as
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:03.080]  well as wickedly expensive and wasteful of fossil fuels because there's a few you
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:08.880]  use 40% more fossil fuel if you want to shove the carbon dioxide back into the
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.000]  ground after it's emitted when you burn it so they've been discussing all of
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:18.400]  these things and geoengineering hasn't really been featured that much at this
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:24.240]  particular conference because it's begun to seem just pretty kooky and one of the
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:29.440]  things that they're quite worried about here is the kookiness of a number of
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:32.240]  the people that get attracted to these conferences I mean there was a there was
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:38.160]  a person who was visually marketing a perpetual motion power station which I
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.920]  had had looked at last year by a nuclear physicist I knew in South Africa when I
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.320]  was at the Durban conference and he asked the one question is it a closed
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.320]  system they said yes he said he said in that case it's a perpetual motion
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.760]  machine it wouldn't work and all these cooks are now turning up here saying we
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:57.280]  can geoengineer we can do this we can do that just give us a few trillion and
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.680]  we'll do it for you and even the delegates here who are pretty scientifically
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.800]  illiterate it has to be said are beginning to realize that some of these
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:11.840]  scientists are just looking to make themselves rich without delivering
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.840]  anything in return they are the old-fashioned as the economists call
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:20.160]  them rent seekers so no I think geoengineering is gradually disappearing
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.720]  off the radar we've got to keep an eye because they'll keep trying but I don't
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:30.440]  think it's the major danger I think the major danger is of taxation and
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:36.960]  regulation and interference with how much electricity you can use and when
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.000]  you can use it and they're very cleverly marketing this by calling them smart
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.120]  metering the smart grid it's something you hear Al Gore talking about and you
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.600]  know if he's talking about it's going to be bad and it's a surveillance grid where
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:54.840]  it watches everything in your house all the new appliances are coming out to
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:00.880]  interface with it these people are it's be it's like ten times 1984 with a bunch
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:06.360]  of weird simpering ninnies but but I guess they're not like Hitler where
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.400]  they're in a uniform or Napoleon so people aren't threatened by it they just
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:19.040]  shiver around all day this this is tyranny without gackers it's very very clever the presentation it's all for your own good
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:22.960]  we're saving the planet it's good for the environment the kids are joining in
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:27.400]  you know it's all touchy-feely it's very emotional but in fact it's very
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:33.600]  dangerous because they are trying to go for ever more control over every aspect
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:41.640]  of our lives but there are ways yes sir we got to go to break stay with us you

[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.520]  green text and implemented because you know everyone has to use like a cell
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:30.640]  phone or their computer even their television their appliances you know is
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.840]  that something that is behind the scenes that you know the you've investigated
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:39.080]  that's a big question let me let me try to get a question out of that you're
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:44.120]  saying I've got the question I've got the question let me let me say it the
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.920]  question is can they use all these new technologies that we now spend so much
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.440]  our time talking to each other with in order to control us monitor us learn
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.760]  about us tell us instructions turn off our electricity yes they can and they
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:02.840]  will if they think they can get away with it but the great thing is that as
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:09.320]  people become more aware of this there are things that can be done about it you
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:14.400]  can retrofit your devices with additional devices that filter out their
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.440]  ability to watch you listen to you control you turn off your electricity
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:24.360]  etc and we can invent and install these devices faster than they can pass laws
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.840]  saying we're not allowed to and in the end we will simply get the better of them
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:34.120]  by out technologizing them the great thing is what they're trying to do is
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:40.120]  actually wildly ambitious and with very very simple precautions you can prevent
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:44.880]  them doing it for instance the two guys who invented pretty good privacy which
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:49.040]  is a form of encoding and encrypting your emails they use the thing called a
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:54.760]  trapdoor cipher which was a very nice advanced concept in mathematics which
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:01.360]  prevented the authorities from being able to decode the emails of people who
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.560]  use this particular system and that's the first of many such devices and
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.240]  possibilities that are now beginning to come on to the market it's going to be a
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:16.240]  huge growth industry when people really realize just how unfree they could be
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:22.520]  made if they were to allow these devices which now as Alex is saying have these
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:27.760]  built-in abilities to communicate with the center let's jam in one more Lord
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:33.360]  Monkton Frank and Louisiana you're on the air listening on short life yes you
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.640]  know we know that these globalists are a diabolical mindset and they're godless
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:42.080]  myths and tropes and I remember in the 90s Catherine Bertini of the UN World
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:47.360]  Fruit Group came out and said that food is a weapon we use it to control people
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.120]  for this we do not apologize what does Lord Monkton think about this and has
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:56.720]  he seen any of that coming up well indeed this is exactly what has been
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:01.600]  going on and even from within the UN there isn't there are now concerns about
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:07.000]  this kind of flagrant interference by the UN in of course chiefly the lives of
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  poorer people in the poorer countries and the UN's right to food rapporteur
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:24.680]  her Jean Ziegler said in 2007 that the biofuels scam was a crime against
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:30.520]  humanity he said when people are you know when millions are starving the
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:35.640]  diversion of food to biofuels is a crime against money they themselves are
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.560]  beginning to realize that this is wrong and that is why I went into that
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:44.200]  conference well well said Lord Monkton great job great job they're fighting
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:49.800]  for us science and public policy.org that's the correct site right that's
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.640]  the one all right fantastic I'm going for memory I visited all the time God

[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:47.360]  idea from listening to the show and we're gonna play coming up in a little
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:56.400]  while the the the premiere of my son on air with terrorism 101 but first off the
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.640]  bad news I predicted it wasn't hard to predict the big mega banks want your
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.320]  money the middle class and poor people and that's why the Democrats are now
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:10.280]  saying led by Mr. Dean will play that clip later that you poor people need to
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.840]  pay more money to well don't worry you will you're gonna get cut from 40 hours
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.720]  to 30 or 20 hours and you'll have to get a second or third job and they'll say oh
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:21.640]  look there's more jobs in the economy people are getting more jobs it is so
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:26.640]  horrible it's designed to make it where you can't get out of you know poverty and
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.840]  then become working class and then become upper blue collar and then become
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.160]  lower middle class it's what authoritarians have always sought to do in
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:38.320]  every regime is freeze the classes and get rid of the middle class and it's
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.760]  it's just it's going to be devastating we've already lost about half our
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:46.520]  wealth last 30 years they've erased things back to the 50s level that's been
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.080]  out major statistics last month they got double the number of people on food
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:53.400]  stamps now as you know and here's the Washington Post headline Republicans
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:58.320]  wave the white flag and they say one of Boehner's lieutenants Pete Roscombe of
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.040]  Illinois stepped up to the microphone essentially pleading for the president to
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:10.720]  show mercy and he said and it goes on to say that right now he's hoping to lead
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:16.040]  that is Boehner the Francis GOP to an orderly surrender and they're talking
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:21.280]  about giving Obama unlimited money and giving the power of the purse to Obama
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:27.160]  so I mean this is the total move in a dictatorship I mean it's really really
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:33.600]  happening and the other Republicans are like 990 billion in tax increases get
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:41.400]  rid of 600 billion in in write-offs just devastating we agree with your 3.8
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:46.480]  percent tax on all investments devastating we agree to this we agree to
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:52.560]  that we agree to get rid of the home exemption the tax write-off I mean the
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:57.320]  country is going to go into cardiac arrest and that's the plan and then the
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:00.440]  government will be your savior with more welfare and more food stamps and
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:07.640]  there'll be a hundred million on food stamps to be informed and to watch this
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:11.960]  and to have Obama supporters I see the YouTube videos of them we get calls from
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:18.080]  them they giggle they laugh they go you lost you wanted Romney and I'm like
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:21.200]  Romney was on by the same people and a placeholder the Republicans are sold
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:24.200]  out the same people they're gonna go along with Obama no they're not just
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.200]  gun racist in fact the funniest thing ever is an info wars.com you guys punch
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:33.160]  up my screen please yeah it's still up there this is the funniest cartoon I

[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.160]  this is the funniest cartoon I've seen a long time it shows a donkey at the
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:46.280]  optometrist you know looking through the eye machine through different lenses to
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:51.840]  see what type of prescription the donkey in a suit the Democratic Party needs and
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:56.400]  they're looking at the wall you know that normally has letters in it and he's
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:00.120]  looking through the lens machine and Uncle Sam is the optometrist the doctor
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:08.840]  and it says we are 16 trillion in debt it's 1-6-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 in debt and
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:13.840]  he's pointing at it and what is the donkey saying he's reading what is the
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:24.560]  donkey saying he's reading he says he sees the word racist exactly true you're
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.720]  a Ku Klux Klan member if you own a gun that's what they're now putting out on
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:31.280]  Fox Sports and then they have them on national TV and people agree with it
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:35.440]  that's right it's racist yeah gun gun or should phrase it yeah the Ku Klux Klan
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:39.680]  doesn't want us to you know take the guns the Ku Klux Klan literally got the
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:45.040]  first gun lost past in the south on record on record mostly hey we're in
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.720]  deep debt we this is not sustainable mega banks want us bankrupt we get they're
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:53.680]  loaning us zeros and ones they get the whole world not a good idea things are

[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:47.000]  all off anyways oh man oh man all right enough of that our own reporter David
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.320]  Ortiz I doing a great job went out and did this piece because now they're
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:57.620]  talking about in the news they're talking about bringing things like Black
[02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:01.960]  Friday to the day of Christmas and the day after Christmas more hysteria so the
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:06.360]  Black Friday is Asian fighting over Chinese slave goods and turns out it's
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:10.000]  one of the worst days of the year to go shopping cuz they they they increase the
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.160]  prices the week before then lower it then or they even just up prices and
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:15.840]  people think well this is that and they'll go fight over just anything
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.640]  women fighting people stampeding well I wish they'd stampede for freedom I
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.880]  wish they'd stampede to read a book I wish they'd stampede to be you know
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.680]  smart enough to wipe their own rear ends let's go ahead and go to his piece
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:41.600]  here it is the immense popularity of Black Friday and the introduction of
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.540]  Thanksgiving Day shopping this year is prompting many Americans to
[02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:50.240]  question the mental health of people who participate in these events the
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:54.560]  success of Thanksgiving Day shopping has also prompted many media outlets to
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:58.360]  hint that Christmas Day shopping could be introduced to the public in coming
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:03.360]  years we asked local Austinites would they think of this prospect okay do you
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:11.880]  want a Black Friday Christmas no no no why not because you have 364 other days
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:17.160]  to shop and I don't think people should shop on Christmas Day absolutely not I
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.520]  believe that Black Friday for Thanksgiving is already enough for the
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:27.080]  American consumer and Black Friday Christmas will destroy everything
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:36.360]  really Christmas is about finally destroy it for real no why not first of
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:40.720]  all I don't even know what it is absolutely not I think that that would
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:46.120]  ruin Christmas it just would to make it its own holiday would be I don't know I
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:52.720]  don't like it that'd be awesome yes definitely I think it would help I mean
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:56.040]  if they want to be open go for it I'm not gonna be out there shopping so I'll
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:59.480]  be with family hanging out at home relaxing what are your thoughts when
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:05.960]  you see videos of people trampling each other for Rachi products white trash
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:12.600]  never number one stand in that line number two I would never like trample
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:16.440]  over people to get something at Walmart I feel like there's not connect they've
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:23.280]  lost all connection with humans and they see humans as sort of just a roadblock
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:27.680]  in their in their their life I guess they they're just completely closed off to
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:33.240]  others and just really simple-minded well I think it's funny like I said
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:44.160]  well it's kind of hard for me to say because I'm one of them sometimes it's
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.240]  kind of an adrenaline rush to see you know they have five products at this
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.680]  price and there's 20 people going for it you know who can it's like who can win
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:57.400]  the trophy well I'm working in medical field and we had a lot of people that
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:01.880]  actually had broken bones because of Black Friday you know they got the TV
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:07.200]  but they had a $4,000 doctor bill to go along with it according to the National
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:12.160]  Retail Federation stores that were open this past Thanksgiving Day experienced
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:17.080]  a 22% increase in profits over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend according
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:21.560]  to the Wall Street Journal in past years many retail stores were also closed
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.640]  from Memorial Day 4th of July and Labor Day what do you think of the fact that
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:29.240]  a lot of experts say that the discounts on Black Friday aren't even that great
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:34.080]  I agree totally agree they're not that great they just make you spend more
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:39.680]  money so they're not that good you can get the same discounts if you just watch
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:44.360]  the ads and look online I didn't know that that's pretty interesting them I
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:49.400]  didn't know that either I mean the first the first toy that I ever got from
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.600]  Black Friday was the Game Boy Color and it was like $40 when we got it at the
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:58.480]  time that was something that cost $200 so I always thought Black Friday was a
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:03.240]  great deal there's the Black Friday desicion of society boost holiday morale
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:07.480]  or hurt holiday morale in your opinion I don't know if it boosts or hurts but it
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:12.040]  certainly changes the focus and that's the problem I mean it can boost it it
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:16.440]  can because I mean it's kind of a family thing a lot of families make it an event
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:21.360]  to go and get everyone together so in a way it can create like a family thing
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:34.920]  for Info Wars Nightly News I'm David Ortiz all right there is David's report
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:40.440]  excellent report man the cameras they've got now the high-def we've got I look
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:44.640]  like a million dollars that report and this is not product placement they don't
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.720]  need a sponsor but those Canon cameras now just look a little better than 35
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:53.240]  millimeter I've shot 35 millimeter before with Kevin Booth I mean that is

[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.120]  got a board game likening it to international terrorism explaining how
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:20.360]  governments use it to take people's liberties here it is terrorism 101
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:26.120]  hello your friendly neighborhood patriot here for an episode of how terrorism really works
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:42.600]  first off our terrorist group needs a scary name can you say LCI ADA let's try
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:50.280]  again LCI ADA ah it does roll off the tongue LCI ADA it's a perfect name now
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:56.240]  let's say the green piece here represents the terrorists the terrorists then move
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:03.440]  into Pakistan or Afghanistan or whatever Stan is not under banker control the
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:09.080]  media then joins in to hype up the terror threat and operates with impunity from
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:19.880]  safety once the terror threat is established the banksters puppets
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.640]  send in the troops to take out the terrorists they put in there in the
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:28.480]  first place then the bankers install their own dictator to take control the
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:35.320]  resources and oppress the people as a bonus the banks via the black ops and
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:40.000]  intelligence agencies will then ship the drugs back into the host country so they
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.960]  can imprison their own citizens for using the drugs make huge profits selling
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:49.600]  the drugs which finance other terror operations around the globe and the
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.920]  carry on the top is billions upon billions made on money laundering
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:59.560]  operations for the bankers in the sense you watching as this opium is being
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:04.120]  grown I know it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:08.640]  about it well frankly this is a part of the culture so while it might grind in
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:13.720]  my gut and it's what they do and if the citizens of the host country gets wise
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:19.080]  to these games or gets uppity the banks via media will hype in nuclear terror
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:24.280]  threat or the underwear bomber or Christmas tree bomber any excuse to take
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:30.560]  the American people's rights well that just about wraps it up for terrorism
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:36.240]  101 how terrorism really works I'm your friendly neighborhood patriot and now

[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:47.600]  nine-minute excerpt of the full 50-minute Joe Rogan interview because you know
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:50.440]  waking Joe Rogan up to the New World Order is gonna be a powerful tool because
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:55.760]  he's one of the most popular people out there in the culture you know that isn't
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:01.560]  a zombie like Lindsay Lohan or something he's a really smart guy and you know Joe
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.840]  when I first knew him 14 years ago you know didn't buy into a lot of this stuff
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:11.600]  he didn't trust the government but he's he's really woken up a lot and he's a
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:16.200]  really funny smart guy but you know at the same time it's an it's important to
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:19.800]  try to get converts to what's happening with the New World Order out there like
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:23.320]  Ventura didn't believe me five years ago they were putting cancer viruses in the
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:28.800]  vaccines now he does and by the way Ventura is on Monday let's go ahead and
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:34.860]  go to a phone call here Ted in Tennessee you're on the air sir welcome hello
[02:34:34.860 --> 02:34:40.320]  Alex how are you today good my friend okay I have a simple little question but
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:45.040]  I have a few statements to go ahead of it the Federal Reserve which is not part
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:50.280]  of the United States government leases its money to the federal government the
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:55.080]  income tax that we pay does not actually benefit the United States government
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:35:01.840]  but pays the lease on the currency that we use since the elite or the top two
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:09.000]  percent use the money and basically have abused that money to the point that
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.320]  it's been devalued because the Federal Reserve keeps putting more money in to
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:24.040]  cover their butts basically why not just raise the elite or top two percent the
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:29.740]  amount that the money becomes devalued so therefore not just raise their money
[02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:36.360]  39% but go back as you said earlier going back to the 1950s rate put them
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:43.880]  back to the 90% and put then therefore making the money cover or their money's
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:51.120]  use putting it back to the value that we were at at that time of making the
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:57.160]  money something that is of a value that we can understand sure sir I mean we
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:00.200]  have to kick the mafia out that runs it but let me just explain something number
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:04.520]  one to say that the top two percent do you make over a quarter million dollars
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:08.080]  a year you're in the top two percent okay people making a quarter million a
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:12.080]  million five million a year are not even near the ultra-rich who are
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:16.160]  billionaires controlling leverage trillions to take over the bankers
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:21.520]  created over a thousand five hundred trillion they control a fraud which they
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:26.640]  then had government sign on to they got investments invested in toxic fraud and
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:32.040]  then instead of saying triage it oh it's now infected everything so you've got to
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:36.080]  let us run things instead of them going to jail and we'll try to prop this up
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:39.920]  but there's no way to prop it up it's designed to consolidate everything so it
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:44.240]  is the top I've seen the number broken down there's less than six thousand top
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:49.120]  globalist minions there's less than 20 elite families I mean I told people I
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:52.280]  did the research decades ago and now it's mainstream news the Rockefellers and
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:58.000]  Rothschilds in 2000s merged their banks now they've merged this year their
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.680]  private holdings but they were the Rockefellers were always Rothschild agents
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:09.680]  and so this is what we're talking about here and so it's it's I mean do the math
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:13.800]  out of out of seven million three hundred million people if there's less
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:20.160]  than a few thousand it's not even point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine I mean
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:24.760]  it's it's it's okay and and and then they convince everybody rich people or the
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:28.520]  guy driving a nice new Corvette that lives a million dollar house that's the
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:32.720]  guy that has a pool for the construction company to build that's the guy that goes
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:37.600]  and buy stuff at Dillerts that's the guy that goes out and buys a car that's the
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:41.080]  guy that puts kids through college that's who you want instead they tell the
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:46.880]  poor dumb-down mass of people that's the reason you're poor is that guy all right
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:50.680]  so I hear you great question I appreciate your call let me go to this Joe
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:53.160]  Rogan piece right now and then I'll come back and go to your calls because I
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:56.880]  don't want to wait I just tried to tweet it out on Twitter did go out I don't see
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:01.200]  it here on my Twitter I did that yeah because I sent it out and then it
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:04.720]  didn't even do anything on my phone I saw I'm gonna try to retweet it right
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:09.920]  now I'm holy mackerel but again we bleeped out some of the racy stuff some
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:12.640]  people on YouTube are like why'd you bleep it because we're gonna air it on
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:17.480]  the radio and plus we're held to such a high standard on YouTube that they will
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:21.880]  shut our channel down for a community guidelines violation everybody else can
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:26.480]  cuss but I suppose I don't want to you know and I'm not judging people like kids
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:30.000]  we're talking about not using King's English it's just funny you know I'm on
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:35.600]  AM and FM stations and the FCC will come and will give me a $4,000 fine and
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:40.000]  then a $50,000 fine and then a million dollar fine like Howard Stern so that's
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.400]  that's why these are bleeped I mean it's just the children on the internet that
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:48.600]  sit there going hey I want to hear the cussing you know again it's cut out none
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:51.760]  of that even matters it's just I don't want to debate or to discuss it here's
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:55.720]  this great interview with Joe and I'm calling this excerpt Joe Rogan on
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.040]  government conspiracies here it is
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:08.920]  at your gut level Joe what do you think about the bit long right I don't know you
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:14.040]  know first of all I think that being a position that I think whenever you talk
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:20.760]  about any little any intense military operation like that those guys those
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:26.360]  those Navy SEALs that did that was Navy SEALs yes those are some of the
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:31.600]  baddest on the planet I mean I I have a lot of respect for someone's ability
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:37.200]  fortitude character discipline the type of discipline involved in being a Navy
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:41.560]  SEAL I have a tremendous amount of respect for those type of human beings
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:48.000]  but what I what I don't necessarily trust is the people that make the
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.960]  decisions that put these guys into certain positions it's them that I trust
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:58.560]  implicitly like I understand the kind of discipline that it takes to be elite
[02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:04.280]  at anything and when you're in an elite at something as life or death as being a
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:09.600]  Navy SEAL you're a bad period so I don't ever want to say anything that's
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:15.720]  disrespectful to anybody that's in that position because I I I respect their
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:23.200]  intentions 100% but it sounds like a silly story like everybody says this
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:27.360]  guy's been dead for a long time they said that bin Laden I mean I see all
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:32.480]  these different people who've said that bin Laden had already been dead I don't
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:37.760]  know I wasn't there I have no information other than some that I read the
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:41.160]  newspaper or watch on TV but the official stories turn up don't be true and I
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:45.360]  went to it seems like they lie about everything we're ready to do this seven
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:52.840]  what seven minutes good I seven minutes I actually talked I'm not gonna get a
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:58.080]  whole story hey guys an ABCL been to his house yeah turned out I'm gonna give
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:01.480]  too much away my family knows him he's not in silting situation with his body
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:05.760]  only a few that lived uh-huh the hell they blow up a helicopter that night they
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.600]  went in killed the target brought it up with a helicopter up told the SEALs
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:12.880]  that was bin Laden the helicopters they got away and then the other SEALs got
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:17.080]  mad and they blew up remember the SEALs six the helicopter blew up a month
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:22.240]  later and the SEALs said so women you're saying SEALs attacked other SEALs no
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:27.000]  no no what I'm saying is they send a bunch of helicopters right go in to kill
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.160]  a target right they're told get this target it's right right they bring
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:35.120]  bin Laden's body onto the helicopter it blew up right they blew it up then the
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:40.000]  rest the SEAL team six complained about it and most of them died and blew up they
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.400]  killed most people on the raid oh remember a month later the SEAL
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:48.200]  helicopters yeah I thought that was just another unrelated incident that was
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:52.760]  just part of like what they're doing over there is incredibly dangerous but
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:56.520]  they blew it but that was the biggest loss in the entire Afghan war right but
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:00.480]  that is it means there a real connection between those two I talked to the SEAL
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:04.480]  and he said we believe Al Qaeda put a bomb on the plane on the helicopter or
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.040]  the or the government but it could have been that they just got shot down too
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:12.400]  right is that possible well they said they're in war they never but that was
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:17.120]  the biggest loss of SEALs but sometimes that goes down remember that scud
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:21.640]  missile that landed on that the barracks in the first Iraq war there was like no
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:25.480]  deaths up until that very few deaths and then this one scud missile got through
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:29.200]  and killed a bunch of people and then that was that one big event I mean big
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:32.320]  events do have to have been true you're absolutely right but I mean my whole
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:37.520]  point is the fake situation room photo right that was fake the burying at sea
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:42.080]  well yeah it seems like a silly story but the problem is they this is the real
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:47.240]  problem the only reason why I should even be saying something like this the
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:50.360]  only reason why you should qualify when you say something like that like it
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:55.600]  seems like a silly story but this is this is my my reason for saying this I've
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:00.240]  saw the Jessica Lynch story which was that the girl who was injured in the
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:04.480]  Iraq war they said that they had to go in and rescue her and there was a gun
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:09.200]  fight and they rescued her and she said that that no such thing ever happened
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:14.520]  and she got in a lot of trouble and took a lot of heat by refuting the the
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:20.360]  official statement they tried to manufacture a narrative about what
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:25.920]  about Pat Tillman yes exactly that's two things well Pat Tillman the bottom line
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:30.360]  is what whatever happened with him he was killed by friendly fire now that's
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.320]  not what was in the initial report the initial reports of his death were that
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:38.200]  he had died in defending his country and the corner wouldn't lie and said it was
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:43.320]  homicide well I mean was it homicide or was it friendly fire I think there's a
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:47.040]  lot of confusion when you're in a war shot him in a distance that he begged for
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.240]  his life they came up and triple tapped him around and for it but how do you know
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:54.600]  that though if you weren't but if you weren't there corners report yeah but see
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:58.560]  man how do you unless you were there unless you saw how it happened the
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:02.560]  corners report it's gonna show you guys shot no no no I hear you it's just when
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:05.800]  you have a history of Pat was sending letters back to his family said I'm gonna
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:10.920]  go public on the war on drugs this whole thing's a fraud it's a lie and then he
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:14.240]  magically dies and I've just learned how their MO works but no no I hear you but
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:19.520]  it is but you're what your possibility what you're saying is pop that is that's
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:24.520]  in the game too it's possible I talk to his brother and I say his brother's hard
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:28.560]  core man I saw his brother at the reading at his funeral where he was
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:32.840]  talking about how Pat didn't believe in God and Pat's dead you know it was like
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:39.040]  it was really intense it was really intense and his story is a strange one
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:45.680]  I mean it's a guy who you know this square jawed uber handsome super powerful
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.360]  athlete who decides who's gonna defend his country like that football was
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:55.240]  secondary in his mind to me he was a real patriot I mean this is a guy who
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:45:00.160]  really abandoned this multi-million dollar lucrative career as a
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:05.000]  professional athlete to go and defend his country I mean that is a powerful
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.440]  human being that cannot be done so it was a fraud was gonna come back it's
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:13.240]  being out yeah yeah and and was strong enough to realize that he had been duped
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.680]  and didn't you know look he's a dangerous guy to have against you and I
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.920]  think that the system you know it doesn't like people like that and does
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:26.920]  that mean that he was murdered no because I think war is hell and I think
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:30.040]  horrible things happen in war and I think it's very possible that could
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:34.120]  have accidentally gotten to go out in three minutes so let's just get this
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:38.400]  three minutes ladies and gentlemen before the new world order shuts this place
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:45.240]  down I remember meeting you like a 1998 99 14 years ago whatever it was and you
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:47.840]  were like yeah I know a lot of this is true but you're going too far with that
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:51.880]  has not a lot of what I've talked about listen man I will tell you this and I
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.520]  give you credit for this all the time I there's a lot of things that used to say
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:00.480]  back in the 90s I thought you were crazy you were just ahead of your time you
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:04.960]  were way ahead of the curve you were way ahead of the curve on a lot of that
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:12.160]  was just massive conspiracy theory nonsense in the 1990s stuff that people
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.240]  would say there's no f***ing way the government would ever do something like
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:22.360]  indefinite suspension or detention rather of American civilians with no trial
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:27.640]  they would never do that completely unconstitutional boom there it is that
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:34.440]  your your video I I recommend this video all the time to people 9-11 the road
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:40.000]  to tyranny when you showed that the World Trade Organization in Seattle was
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.440]  clearly invaded by agent provocateurs who are most likely military people
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:50.000]  we saw their their militants police spoke out there the military-grade shoes
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.520]  the fact they weren't able to arrest these guys they had to let them go all
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:57.800]  that stuff that you showed all these people came into a nonviolent protest and
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:01.840]  became violent and then turned it into something that the police had to respond
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:08.080]  to I mean it's I never even thought that that would be in the the menu of the
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:13.240]  military I would have never believed it would and then much many years after I
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:17.640]  met you the Freedom of Information Act documents for Operation Northwood were
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:22.560]  released that was way after I met you years years later and I remember wow I
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.560]  remember reading that going like Alex Alex isn't crazy at all like they really
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:31.440]  planned on blowing up civilian jetliners they would have to have a drone jetliner
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:34.960]  and blame it on Cuba and get us to go to war with Cuba they were gonna do all
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:39.560]  sorts of crazy things like that was really in the in the menu for you know
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:45.800]  the 1960s like that I thought you were bananas with some of this stuff you were
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:48.960]  talking about and a lot of that stuff that you were talking about has turned
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:53.160]  out to be absolutely a hundred percent true I gotta go on stage and do comedy
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:48:02.880]  thank you brother thanks very much hey but hey did like to tell the secret it was all in ran corporation documents they admitted it yeah they
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:07.560]  bragged they're doing this job that's why I freak out all right that is kind of the
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:16.280]  end of the interview right there and on the subject of the stuff being admitted
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:24.520]  it was all admitted back then it wasn't that I was guessing all of this I mean
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:28.920]  they've done thousands and thousands of declassified studies some studies
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:33.560]  individually had over a hundred thousand people involved in them or they
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:38.000]  would radiate school kids say we're taking kids on a field trip to the army
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.600]  base and then take them into a hangar and then shoot radiation into them you
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:48.000]  know just unbelievable and there's thousands of things like that and then
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:53.160]  it's in the US code that they can kill you if it's for law enforcement or
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:57.560]  research purposes with radiation guns and everything else and it's all there
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.160]  oh you're like oh yeah what's the source on that US code title 50 chapter 32
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:06.600]  subsection 1528 paragraph B people like little kids go read it they go well it
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:10.560]  says they can't do secret testing until that subsection where it says unless
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.240]  it's for law enforcement or any research purpose that's why all the chem
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:17.400]  trailing is called research oh it's on the official program it's just five
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:22.120]  billion dollars one part of the program a year and you've got them saying
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:26.280]  tortures good secret arrest the NSA is like yeah we listen everything you do

[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:20.080]  getting it and it actually put me in bed for about a day and a half but you know
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:24.280]  what I'm great hadn't it probably had flu in like six seven eight years and I'm
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:29.120]  stronger because the flu vaccine they admit never guesses the right flu and

[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:44.280]  the store get this or that because it's what's closest to my house because it's
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:47.840]  kind of old mini grocery store and I go in CVS I go in Walgreens and it's just

[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:54.920]  to me this happened to you last night tell folks oh yeah as you can tell by my
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:59.920]  voice I'm not really feeling very good today and last night it was a lot worse
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:06.800]  and you know I wouldn't got what I could and I will just try and kill it and when
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:11.720]  I went to check out there the guy said how are you doing I said well not too good
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:16.160]  I'm a little sick as you can see he says oh well you you got to get over here
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:19.440]  because they're they're doing flu shots you know the last thing you'd want once
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:22.960]  you're sick is to take a shot if you're pregnant the last thing you want but now
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:26.920]  they say that's the time it was always don't do it and in the insert if you're
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:30.320]  already ill or if you're pregnant now oh no that's when you want to do it well
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:34.640]  and then what I told the guy was I'd rather stab myself in the face and then
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:39.600]  the guy behind me got all you know what's going on and yeah you better watch
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:42.160]  that I'll have you taken away for reeducation oh you're threatening

[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:55.640]  an apartment complex where I live including the gates couldn't get out
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:00.200]  and the people were panicking over that and getting angry and it was just total
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:04.720]  bedlam you know because there's imagine we're so dependent on technology so it
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:08.640]  I just you know they can't even get out of the gates what's gonna happen you know

[03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:35.840]  everything you guys are doing love your son the first point I'd like to make is
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:42.080]  do you guys offer a transcript of your show no but I can't offer you another
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:46.440]  caddy check quote one it's a parking lot I can't really do a drotty danger
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:51.840]  filled but sorry go ahead no no no listen we should do a transcript we
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:55.080]  should do a transcript and people volunteer sometimes and transcribe
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:59.480]  really good interviews out there but I just I don't have the money I mean we
[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:05.480]  could be in it cost a pretty penny to get transcripts done you know what I mean
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:11.160]  yeah the organization I belong to would be willing to produce a transcript for
[03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:14.640]  you got for for your show well that's good but you have to have kind of a
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:17.280]  group you can trust I sounds like I can trust you it's just that people might
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:20.600]  put something wrong in the transcript so we have to add on there this is a rush
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:27.240]  transcript may not be correct but no that's a good idea so we should do that
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:33.240]  what else is on your mind the people's branch.org and we'd be willing to do
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:36.440]  that well thank you sir but I mean look good interviews things you think are
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:39.680]  important you know if there's people out there that are great at transcription
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:43.640]  if if some of you picked once a month that interview to transcribe we've got
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:46.200]  millions of listeners we'd have everything transcribed just pick
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:49.720]  something you think's important transcribe it and email it to I guess
