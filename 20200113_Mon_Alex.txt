[00:00.000 --> 00:26.060]  Alright.
[00:26.060 --> 00:50.420]  Coming to you live from planet Earth, broadcasting, intergalactic, going interstellar and interdimensional.
[00:50.420 --> 01:01.420]  I am Alex Jones, your host. This is the year 2020, with 294 days left until the historic election.
[01:01.420 --> 01:07.420]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, January 13th, 2020 transmission.
[01:07.420 --> 01:22.420]  I'm going to be live here for the full four hours.
[01:22.420 --> 01:41.420]  I've tried to do this a thousand times and always fail just to even read the top headlines to you, but I'm going to try it again today.
[01:41.420 --> 01:57.420]  Meanwhile, official textbooks in California teach children how to drink blood in vampire sex rituals in the official textbook Vampirism is a recognized loving group.
[01:57.420 --> 02:08.420]  And of course, we have mega massive news that I should just stop and focus everything on, but I'm not going to until the fourth hour.
[02:08.420 --> 02:16.420]  A two day official UN summit with the director of World Health Organization and the director of science.
[02:16.420 --> 02:30.420]  And there are other sub directors admitting that vaccines are killing people in mass and a giant concerted cover ups of that and that the frontline medical staff doctors and nurses know they're hurting people.
[02:30.420 --> 02:44.420]  The frontline is wobbly and it's not for vaccination at the cover up is collapsing. I mean, how huge is that three reports we filed since Friday, it banned on video on that.
[02:44.420 --> 02:49.420]  And yeah, couple of them got 200,000 views, which is great for independent platform.
[02:49.420 --> 02:54.420]  If we still had our old YouTube channel up that would have like 10 million views right now, we'd really be warning some people.
[02:54.420 --> 03:02.420]  So my greatest frustration is, we've got the money shot. We've got the coup de grace. We've got the kill shot.
[03:02.420 --> 03:15.420]  I mean, we have their asses in their meetings. This is a lot of the activists have seen this. They say this has got to be a deep fake until they follow the link below to 20 hours of it.
[03:15.420 --> 03:18.420]  They did not know this was going to be released.
[03:18.420 --> 03:24.420]  Someone released it on the 20th on the UN website, but hidden.
[03:24.420 --> 03:28.420]  And it got downloaded last week by activist who we've linked to their reports.
[03:28.420 --> 03:33.420]  And it's just incredible that YouTube is taking down the raw video.
[03:33.420 --> 03:36.420]  It's like they take down Jeffrey Epstein information.
[03:36.420 --> 03:47.420]  They are taking down the raw video of the UN heads admitting talk about evil.
[03:47.420 --> 03:53.420]  That's what big tech serves is just absolute complete evil.
[03:53.420 --> 04:00.420]  They are there to make sure no one can expose what's happening and when stuff like this comes out.
[04:00.420 --> 04:05.420]  People are so conditioning. Oh, it's just a deep fake. Yeah, 20 hours of it's a deep fake.
[04:05.420 --> 04:07.420]  There's all the admissions you ever need.
[04:07.420 --> 04:20.420]  We have the head UN scientist, the head of the WHO in TV productions from last year saying save and effective never hurt anybody.
[04:20.420 --> 04:23.420]  So that's coming up.
[04:23.420 --> 04:34.420]  We have the individual that I believe is controlled opposition, Richard Spencer on the show today as well.
[04:34.420 --> 04:40.420]  You know, the okay to punch a Nazi guy. I don't think it's okay to punch anybody who hasn't punched you first.
[04:40.420 --> 04:45.420]  But my guy just reeks of being synthetic. He'll be on with us.
[04:45.420 --> 04:53.420]  And just so much more Congress just woke up to something really big finally that around 90% of our drugs are made by the Chai comms.
[04:53.420 --> 04:59.420]  Oh, you didn't know that. Stay with us.
[04:59.420 --> 05:08.420]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[05:08.420 --> 05:10.420]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[05:10.420 --> 05:17.420]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[05:17.420 --> 05:24.420]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[05:24.420 --> 05:29.420]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[05:29.420 --> 05:33.420]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[05:33.420 --> 05:39.420]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[05:39.420 --> 05:43.420]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[05:43.420 --> 05:53.420]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life
[05:53.420 --> 05:59.420]  so much better. So visit infowarstore.com today.
[05:59.420 --> 06:19.420]  Music
[06:19.420 --> 06:22.420]  The Strength of Righteousness.
[06:22.420 --> 06:27.420]  Music
[06:27.420 --> 06:36.420]  If you understand the strength of righteousness, that just simply means conforming to God's plan.
[06:36.420 --> 06:46.420]  Then you know why the enemy seeks to corrupt us at every front and trick us by increment to turn loose of common sense that God gave us.
[06:46.420 --> 07:05.420]  Because it's like armor falling away from your soul, from your body, a hedge, a wall of protection, spiritually, interdimensionally, under law, universal law.
[07:05.420 --> 07:21.420]  So that once the walls are gone, once the drawbridge is down, once the main gates have been blown off its hinges, this force in the universe of evil can have its way with you.
[07:21.420 --> 07:26.420]  We have a lot of news and information to obviously cover today.
[07:26.420 --> 07:41.420]  And I also want to be able to open the phones up in the second hour. Richard Spencer, other than David Duke, is one of the most famous white nationalist, white supremacist in the world.
[07:41.420 --> 07:49.420]  And I do not believe David Duke is a fed. I do not believe David Duke is an operative for the deep state.
[07:49.420 --> 08:06.420]  I don't agree with David Duke on a lot of things. But for the media to demonize David Duke and call him the worst person on earth, because he is racially based when all the minority groups are being taught to be just as racist, but that's supposedly acceptable, is a fraud.
[08:06.420 --> 08:13.420]  And I'm not here defending David Duke. David Duke's attacked me before.
[08:13.420 --> 08:24.420]  But with Richard Spencer, the guy is as phony as a $3 bill. And I'll just say that up front, he wants to come on the show.
[08:24.420 --> 08:35.420]  And I'll say it, he acts and looks and behaves and his MO is just like somebody that's controlled opposition.
[08:35.420 --> 08:44.420]  I don't have proof of that anymore that when I'm driving down the street and I see a cowdy running down the side of the road, that's a cowdy.
[08:44.420 --> 08:48.420]  Well, are you an expert? Have you sampled its hair? No, I mean, I know what a damn cowdy looks like, okay?
[08:48.420 --> 08:56.420]  So I don't know how a duck walks. I know how it quacks. I know how it acts. Am I an ornithologist?
[08:56.420 --> 09:02.420]  Am I a scientist of birds to tell you that something's a green-headed mallard and that one's a male?
[09:02.420 --> 09:07.420]  No, I just know it because I read a book on it.
[09:07.420 --> 09:18.420]  But we're going to discuss his attacks on Trump and the view of all places defending Richard Spencer last week.
[09:18.420 --> 09:30.420]  So I hope he shows up. Steve Pacinac wrote a powerful article back a few years ago, controlled opposition behind Charlottesville rally, and it gets into the leader of that.
[09:30.420 --> 09:41.420]  I mean, maybe Spencer isn't an operative. Maybe he just plays right into their hands on so many fronts, but a lot of these white supremacist groups are operatives.
[09:41.420 --> 09:46.420]  So there, I've thrown it out there. I'm not going to sneak attack the guy and I'll let him talk.
[09:46.420 --> 09:49.420]  I'm going to try to shut up and let him have at least half the time.
[09:49.420 --> 10:11.420]  And then I'm going to host the fourth hour today on news that when I saw it up here on Friday evening, I was just dumbfounded.
[10:11.420 --> 10:22.420]  We stayed up here late. Rob Do and I did tend to get that report done. We did another report on Sunday because it's just stunning.
[10:22.420 --> 10:31.420]  And you could take each clip of the seven or eight that we put in our reports and talk for a whole show about it.
[10:31.420 --> 10:35.420]  I mean, normally just one of these people saying what they said would be international news.
[10:35.420 --> 10:43.420]  But of course, this broke on Friday and there's been almost no coverage of it.
[10:43.420 --> 10:53.420]  And it's the head scientist of the UN saying vaccines are killing people. We've been covering it up and none of them are tested and it's getting worse and the people are turning against us.
[10:53.420 --> 11:00.420]  And then it's the head scientist over the world vaccine program saying adjuvants are hurting people.
[11:00.420 --> 11:07.420]  We've got to stop lying about it and we need to take the adjuvants out.
[11:07.420 --> 11:12.420]  And there's no surveillance over what these companies are producing and this is a recipe for disaster.
[11:12.420 --> 11:19.420]  And then they cut to the head scientist in Nigeria who runs the Nigerian program.
[11:19.420 --> 11:24.420]  He talks about all the devastation they're seeing and that this is absolutely two plus two plus four.
[11:24.420 --> 11:32.420]  There's just plus there's no studies of this, not to mention we're giving our children in the first year and a half more than 50 vaccines.
[11:32.420 --> 11:39.420]  And we don't have any idea how those interact together. There's no studies on that.
[11:39.420 --> 11:46.420]  Because, you know, they tell you there's been all these studies and safe and effective.
[11:46.420 --> 11:55.420]  There's all a load of crap. But vaccines worldwide have been given diplomatic immunity.
[11:55.420 --> 12:04.420]  And so now drug companies are piggybacked on that. They've got all these new classes of things that are injected into you that aren't classic vaccines.
[12:04.420 --> 12:19.420]  They're recombinant DNA reprogramming mutatogens and live viruses that eat certain nerve ganglia in the brain. I mean, it's some scary stuff.
[12:19.420 --> 12:33.420]  It's Dr. Frankenstein meets Event Horizon and they're just doing it.
[12:33.420 --> 12:39.420]  And you watch all these scientists who didn't know this was going to be released because they say things on the video.
[12:39.420 --> 12:50.420]  We've now gone over the 20 hours of it. It's linked on Band-Aid video under our report to the full video on the UN site before they take it down.
[12:50.420 --> 13:06.420]  And they're talking about, you know, if the public finds out about this, if the public finds out about that in this internal meeting that they've released a video of.
[13:06.420 --> 13:16.420]  And I thought about this last night. I said, you know, I think one of these top scientists ordered this posted because they're really telling on the whole thing in this video.
[13:16.420 --> 13:24.420]  You see the head of the WHO, the head scientist, she's on TV a month before saying, safe and effective, take them, don't listen to people that tell you they're dangerous.
[13:24.420 --> 13:31.420]  Everything's safe. And then she's in internal videos going, man, we got a major crisis on her hands. That's mega bomb show.
[13:31.420 --> 13:45.420]  This is the biggest health scandal ever. You know, back in the 50s they gave millions of American women and French women and British women and German women a type of tranquilizer.
[13:45.420 --> 13:53.420]  And it caused hundreds of thousands of children to be born with tiny little arms and legs.
[13:53.420 --> 13:59.420]  You know, but they admitted it and pulled the drug off the market. There have been thousands of drugs that they've pulled.
[13:59.420 --> 14:07.420]  But see, not vaccines. They don't ever pull any of them. They just keep giving them to you and telling you nobody ever got hurt.
[14:07.420 --> 14:16.420]  And you've heard all the news channels, arrest people that say this, take their children, take their property. It's a lie. It's a hoax. Nobody ever got sick.
[14:16.420 --> 14:29.420]  You need to be arrested. You're going to get people sick. Well, wait a minute. If you've taken all these wonderful vaccines that are as good as mother's milk or pumpkin pie, then you're covered, right?
[14:29.420 --> 14:37.420]  Oh, and it's the same laugh saying open the borders and bringing people from the third world who are absolutely infested with communicable diseases.
[14:37.420 --> 14:41.420]  And then when there's outbreaks of those in vaccinated populations, they point their finger at us and say, it's our fault.
[14:41.420 --> 14:53.420]  Even though later you read the fine print and they go, well, the big outbreaks in New Jersey and New York were from illegal aliens brought in from Central and South America.
[14:53.420 --> 15:05.420]  Yeah, no kidding. Because it's new strains of all those diseases and the vaccines aren't going to do jack fricking squat.
[15:05.420 --> 15:17.420]  The flu shot, I'm going to explain this again, has never been effective. They admit they've never, the year before, guessed the flu mutation for the next year.
[15:17.420 --> 15:30.420]  And it does nothing because the family of viruses are so diverse. You have to get the exact mutation of a virus, that exact virus for a vaccine to work.
[15:30.420 --> 15:36.420]  So they just play this dumb game. They go, oh, you just don't believe vaccines are science. Yeah, I know they're a science.
[15:36.420 --> 15:45.420]  Just like all these other technologies and a lot of them get your ass killed, including two people that work in this office had their children die from vaccines.
[15:45.420 --> 15:52.420]  And the cover up is coming down. So thank God that's in the fourth hour, but I'm going to hit all the other huge news when we come right back.
[15:52.420 --> 15:57.420]  Please stay with us and please tell folks to tune in. That's how we get the message out, only through you.
[15:57.420 --> 16:06.420]  I'm here with Scott Youseam, founder of OMG Tax. Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:06.420 --> 16:18.420]  Every team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments. Sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.420 --> 16:33.420]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help? Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:33.420 --> 16:43.420]  So pay the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less. Call OMG Tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.

[17:08.420 --> 17:17.420]  Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:17.420 --> 17:23.420]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:23.420 --> 17:35.420]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:35.420 --> 17:43.420]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.

[20:20.420 --> 20:47.420]  We are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones, on this live, January 13, 2020, Monday Transmission.
[20:47.420 --> 20:53.420]  All right. I started to do this at the start of the broadcast, but let me just go over some of the news now.
[20:53.420 --> 21:07.420]  And then at the start of the next segment, I'm going to get into some big tech surveillance news that hasn't broken yet, but that is actually in the terms of service of Android, Apple and others.
[21:07.420 --> 21:20.420]  So I'm going to hit that coming up next segment. And then the segment after that, I'm going to get into the unprecedented volcanoes, wire volcanoes all over the globe, suddenly shooting giant clouds of ash miles in the air,
[21:20.420 --> 21:32.420]  why are there all these earthquakes suddenly? What is causing all of that? And we've got a pretty good idea and it's not humans.
[21:32.420 --> 21:46.420]  So we're going to be going through everything on that subject here today. Let me just mention the news here in the stack, though.
[21:46.420 --> 21:56.420]  Defense Secretary Esper, U.S. wants to discuss steps for Iran to become normal country without the condition. That is a very good thing.
[21:56.420 --> 22:11.420]  Video, Iran police shoot at those protesting plane, shoot down. Isn't that amazing that Iran just admitted on Saturday, okay, we shot it down with two tour missiles.
[22:11.420 --> 22:21.420]  The day after it happened, we had the tour missile photos, the shrapnel from them, the large pieces of the projectile that pierces into the aircraft.
[22:21.420 --> 22:29.420]  It's hard and the back middle part explodes. The middle section has explosive and the back has the propellant of the missile.
[22:29.420 --> 22:36.420]  And it was the exact missile we said. We were the first to say it. Tour missile, shot down, thought that it was a U.S. aircraft.
[22:36.420 --> 22:45.420]  I mean, this is a war zone. Iran shot a couple of airliners down back during the Iran-Iraq war. So that's all confirmed now.
[22:45.420 --> 22:51.420]  The really big news, obviously, is that Trump authorized Soleimani's killing seven months ago with conditions.
[22:51.420 --> 22:57.420]  NBC News is now reporting. And Trump's ready to release the document.
[22:57.420 --> 23:01.420]  He was on a kill list and they brought it to him and said, are you ready? He said, yes, with conditions.
[23:01.420 --> 23:05.420]  So the idea that he did this as a wag the dog situation is not true.
[23:05.420 --> 23:15.420]  Also, Congress questions countries' reliance on Chinese drugs, possible cancer-causing ingredients. Really big report on that.
[23:15.420 --> 23:22.420]  China makes the majority of our drugs. And then they dump deadly fentanyl. That's the number one killer in the U.S. right now.
[23:22.420 --> 23:30.420]  That's right. Number one cause of unnatural death is just fentanyl alone. It's surpassed automobile accident deaths.
[23:30.420 --> 23:39.420]  That's our Chaikom friends. Our little friend, G.C. Pink, look at him right here. He's like, sweet guy, such a nice fella.
[23:39.420 --> 23:53.420]  And then I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to get more into it today. California 8th graders taught anal bondage, sex-involving blood in sex ed class.
[23:53.420 --> 24:04.420]  Well, actually, it's vampirism. When you actually go to the textbook, it's called blood play, drinking blood.
[24:04.420 --> 24:10.420]  So that's the externalization of the real cult that they're engaged in. That's a nationalfile.com story.
[24:10.420 --> 24:21.420]  And since the report came out, since the report came out a few days ago, they're now saying they're going to pull the textbook.
[24:21.420 --> 24:28.420]  But that's who runs things. That's who's running our civilization, our society. This isn't being done by accident.
[24:28.420 --> 24:36.420]  Same folks that run drag queen story time. That's really fat pervert in a dress with clown makeup on, having access to your children time.
[24:36.420 --> 24:43.420]  So that's all coming up. Meanwhile, Muslims attack transgender.
[24:43.420 --> 24:52.420]  But that's okay because we're supposed to have the weird leftist crazed pervert society that's bringing in Islam.
[24:52.420 --> 24:59.420]  The two are supposed to live together in peace. That's going to be quite explosive and already is.
[24:59.420 --> 25:07.420]  Also, data shows that Trump's trying to target women more in his advertising because he's slipping with women.
[25:07.420 --> 25:14.420]  Because they won't allow any female engagement that's pro-Trump on Facebook or on Twitter. Doesn't matter how many ads Trump runs.
[25:14.420 --> 25:21.420]  Women that go to the shooting range and say, I like Trump or wear a Trump hat, get banned off Facebook or warned and their photos get taken down.
[25:21.420 --> 25:26.420]  Or Trump tries to run ads that say we're looking for strong women and Facebook banned that.
[25:26.420 --> 25:31.420]  Saying people that weren't women saw the ad and it hurt them to hear about women.
[25:31.420 --> 25:46.420]  Just like city buses in a major US city last week and London's doing it, banned the word mother and banned the word female and banned the word girl.
[25:46.420 --> 25:50.420]  These are all being banned because those are the new inwards too.
[25:50.420 --> 25:56.420]  You're like, that sounds like a joke. No, it's a scientific takeover.
[25:56.420 --> 26:04.420]  Meanwhile, Pelosi is still holding back and not giving the articles of impeachment to the Senate, even though they're demanding them.
[26:04.420 --> 26:07.420]  That's coming to a head this week.
[26:07.420 --> 26:15.420]  Facebook Glitch reveals Greta Thunberg's father posing as teenage climate activists, not just posting articles, but posing as if it's her.
[26:15.420 --> 26:19.420]  But then there was a Glitch showing his ID and then it was him.
[26:19.420 --> 26:23.420]  She's 16 years old, looks like a deranged nine-year-old.
[26:23.420 --> 26:28.420]  She looks like, you know, like one of the little brats or something from Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.
[26:28.420 --> 26:34.420]  She has serious Ashburgers. They admit she's autistic and she is a victim.
[26:34.420 --> 26:38.420]  An autistic child wound up with hate.
[26:38.420 --> 26:45.420]  Well, again, how dare you? I will line you up. You ain't going to take control of you.
[26:45.420 --> 26:51.420]  Only the West must have its energy system set down. Shine that all the power to them.
[26:51.420 --> 26:54.420]  Of course, it's her Antifa parents who are Antifa.
[26:54.420 --> 27:00.420]  And they've got their autistic daughter that they just shove out there at the world, poor thing.
[27:00.420 --> 27:03.420]  But don't worry. Don't worry.
[27:03.420 --> 27:06.420]  Idiocracy, the great Mike Judge film has come true.
[27:06.420 --> 27:11.420]  Elon Musk is advertising his new cars saying there'll be like Siri. They'll be able to talk to you.
[27:11.420 --> 27:15.420]  But you'll be able to hit a button and they'll make a fart noise instead of a horn.
[27:15.420 --> 27:17.420]  And he knows what you want.
[27:17.420 --> 27:24.420]  The number one show for 50 seasons was Oh My Balls.
[27:24.420 --> 27:27.420]  And he's coming out now with a, I guess, a toilet in the seats.
[27:27.420 --> 27:30.420]  You don't have to get up to use the bathroom either when you're watching television.
[27:30.420 --> 27:36.420]  Now, that's a joke, but that's what's coming next in the Idiocracy system and speaking of the devil.
[27:36.420 --> 27:41.420]  When we return on the other side of this break.
[27:41.420 --> 27:45.420]  Apple admits to a lot of really serious criminal activity.
[27:45.420 --> 27:49.420]  But they're just normalizing it all because it's part of the takeover. It's not just Apple.
[27:49.420 --> 27:55.420]  So what do you think the next shoe to drop is?
[27:55.420 --> 27:58.420]  And what's hiding in plain view?
[27:58.420 --> 28:02.420]  We'll talk about it all on the other side of this quick break.
[28:02.420 --> 28:09.420]  Please don't forget that we have our new specials and that it is your purchase of these great products that make everything we do here possible.

[29:58.420 --> 30:02.420]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[30:02.420 --> 30:15.420]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[30:15.420 --> 30:25.420]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[30:25.420 --> 30:36.420]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[30:36.420 --> 30:40.420]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[30:40.420 --> 30:50.420]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[30:50.420 --> 30:58.420]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[30:58.420 --> 31:10.420]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate. But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[31:10.420 --> 31:20.420]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[31:20.420 --> 31:23.420]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given.
[31:23.420 --> 31:33.420]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in forced life, I still got sick every couple years.
[31:33.420 --> 31:48.420]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that. But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWarsLife, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[31:48.420 --> 31:58.420]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.

[33:16.420 --> 33:32.420]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[33:32.420 --> 33:56.420]  So, the social engineers think we're all a bunch of dumb little hay seeds that are caught in all the shucks clopping along here. And that if we saw a real threat telling us it was going to do something bad to us or our neighbors or our families, we'd roll up our sleeves and we'd kick their ass.
[33:56.420 --> 34:18.420]  But if it's done scientifically, if it's hidden in the genetic code of Santa Bola virus that's alive but been altered and injected into our body as an FDA approved vaccine a month ago.
[34:18.420 --> 34:34.420]  Well, how do we know that safe or effective when there's not even studies on the adjuvants in the vaccines and what they're doing and the UN admits that and there's all this clear damage happening.
[34:34.420 --> 34:41.420]  And now they're trying to pass bills all over the US to make you take vaccines.
[34:41.420 --> 35:01.420]  You see, what about the Trojan horses built in to the internet and built into those devices? What about that?
[35:01.420 --> 35:23.420]  You see, there's been a clear infrastructure and a plan of the internet to merge with humans since it was developed and built. And I've shown you the 1962 founding DARPA plan. We've done reports on that and that's not debatable. That's a fact.
[35:23.420 --> 35:50.420]  And then when they passed the telecommunications act of 96 they said smart phones are coming out and by law they'll all be tracked with geolocation down to a few square feet and the companies got caught building in software and systems to listen to you and create word files of everything you ever say or do when the phone is on.
[35:50.420 --> 36:01.420]  But then to get you to accept that so they can openly use it. Oh, Siri, tell me this. Oh, Alexa, tell me that.
[36:01.420 --> 36:13.420]  And Elon Musk comes out and says, oh, I'm going to have a computer that talks to you in my new cars and it'll make fart noises with you. That's an actual headline today.
[36:13.420 --> 36:27.420]  More human than human but not human at all. And so people say, well, that's not a problem. That's not going to be a big deal.
[36:27.420 --> 36:51.420]  I have nothing to hide. Well, it isn't that you don't have anything to hide. It's that this is being built to create a post human system and to take away every human action you do and the creators of it admit it's meant to make you alone, depressed, unhealthy, and to commit suicide.
[36:51.420 --> 37:02.420]  And all the studies and statistics show that the more you use the devices, the more you interface with it, the more lonely, the more unhealthy, the more neurological disorders, the more suicide and it's only getting worse.
[37:02.420 --> 37:07.420]  So I thought I'd just set the table of that before I break some big news here.
[37:07.420 --> 37:21.420]  And I saw this a few months ago and I saw it a few weeks ago and the fact is I have one of these devices because of its uses but I know what it does when I put it in a Faraday cage when I'm not using it.
[37:21.420 --> 37:37.420]  But have you noticed that if you have a droid or you have an apple, particularly apple, that for a couple years it's been doing this but now it's getting really good at it.
[37:37.420 --> 37:50.420]  It takes your photos of say your baby or your wife or your husband or a certain trip you went on and it puts together really good timelines that are as good as a human can do.
[37:50.420 --> 38:03.420]  I mean some of these look like Steven Spielberg directed them with the music and just how they do things right at the perfect time and then your baby daughter says one little thing right at the end.
[38:03.420 --> 38:14.420]  And I went back and looked on my wife's phone at this at the thousands of photos and videos and it, I mean it really picked the very best stuff, very, very frightening.
[38:14.420 --> 38:22.420]  And the point is that's not being done locally on the phone. This is just the interface to the big AI system.
[38:22.420 --> 38:30.420]  It's being done in Beijing where the main computers for Apple are held.
[38:30.420 --> 38:38.420]  And so when you go and you see an Apple headline like oh we only go through your photos to look for child abuse.
[38:38.420 --> 38:44.420]  Oh really and what's the reporting system on that? See there's this whole infrastructure but really that's not what it is.
[38:44.420 --> 39:01.420]  It's matching up with other people that have phones and integrating those together and creating whole timelines of where you go, what you do with machine learning with face scanning technology that knows who the child's siblings are and knows who your friends are.
[39:01.420 --> 39:18.420]  And then it can use that through Facebook databases to track whole groups of people and where you went and where you go and private corporations can go and the New York Times can buy from Facebook a database of everybody you ever associated with and then they call those people up
[39:18.420 --> 39:24.420]  and say hey did Alex Jones ever do anything to you and they're like I only met him at a party once for like five minutes, no.
[39:24.420 --> 39:33.420]  How do you know that? Well you're in a Facebook photo with him. I mean that's just an example of what they can do with this and how you're thinking oh it's the machine it loves me.
[39:33.420 --> 39:50.420]  There's this nice little video and text and photo album that puts together without asking you and says here's your baby in the last six months.
[39:50.420 --> 40:06.420]  And it's AI with your photos stored on a cloud in your business in your life and now making you obsolete because it's editing this together for you and it's showing you the beauty in your life.
[40:06.420 --> 40:09.420]  It's deciding though what beauty you do see.
[40:09.420 --> 40:20.420]  It's just an example of the level of the surveillance and it's admittedly going on but Tim Cook says oh you can trust me.
[40:20.420 --> 40:30.420]  Here's a headline. Smile with your eyes how to beat South Korea's AI hiring bots and land a job.
[40:30.420 --> 40:36.420]  Oh the bots decide whether they're going to hire you or not. See the computers are in full control.
[40:36.420 --> 40:43.420]  Apple apologizes for letting contractors e-drop on Siri sex recordings that was last year.
[40:43.420 --> 40:51.420]  Terrifying or not to fear Apple admits to scanning user photos presumably only to hunt for child abuse.
[40:51.420 --> 40:56.420]  Oh and to put those little albums together for you because people are involved in that as well.
[40:56.420 --> 41:00.420]  Apple admits giving governments access to thousands of iPhones and other devices.
[41:00.420 --> 41:08.420]  Oh yes. They're in China folks. They've given access to everything.
[41:08.420 --> 41:12.420]  Then you just got to ask what's wrong with big tech's eyes.
[41:12.420 --> 41:18.420]  Don't worry though. Walmart expands its robotic workforce to 650 additional stores.
[41:18.420 --> 41:22.420]  The robots surveil you. They restock. They do everything and they're getting rid of the checkout lanes.
[41:22.420 --> 41:31.420]  It's all robot and soon you'll just have a chip but again they're building a prison planet and saying we're obsolete and the world doesn't need humans anymore
[41:31.420 --> 41:39.420]  and telling us it while we march into oblivion. Why would any of us want to go along with this?
[41:39.420 --> 41:47.420]  And as humans discover that the people that work in big corporations, people that work high level at the UN, the people that work in Hollywood
[41:47.420 --> 41:52.420]  it's going to go from people not knowing to knowing but a lot of folks are going to join it just because they're scared
[41:52.420 --> 42:00.420]  hoping that it just appeases the crocodile and that it eats them last but that's not how the universe works.
[42:00.420 --> 42:05.420]  So here's the takeaway from this.
[42:05.420 --> 42:19.420]  Everything you do is being surveilled to make you obsolete and to literally build a world that doesn't need or want humans.
[42:19.420 --> 42:25.420]  In fact build a world where humans existence is threatening the machines.
[42:25.420 --> 42:29.420]  And the globalists have said everywhere they're going to merge the machines and they're going to be gods.
[42:29.420 --> 42:36.420]  What they are is delusional fools that have signed on to Satanist tricks and we live an incredible time.
[42:36.420 --> 42:44.420]  So if you love your children, if you love yourself and you love common sense, stop using the cloud, turn it off on every device, buy an old fashioned camera
[42:44.420 --> 42:51.420]  and start getting away from this beast system because it's going to become more and more evident very very quickly that being part of it doesn't give you advantages
[42:51.420 --> 42:57.420]  but it undercuts you and sabotages you with these evil corporations.
[42:57.420 --> 43:02.420]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[43:02.420 --> 43:05.420]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[43:05.420 --> 43:14.420]  I will never give up but I could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity
[43:14.420 --> 43:22.420]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace
[43:22.420 --> 43:27.420]  that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[43:27.420 --> 43:39.420]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com and banned on video
[43:39.420 --> 43:46.420]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have
[43:46.420 --> 43:50.420]  is at infowars.com forward slash show and banned on video.
[43:50.420 --> 43:57.420]  Take heart folks, they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[43:57.420 --> 44:12.420]  I keep my eye on the news all the time but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine
[44:12.420 --> 44:17.420]  to be given inside the United States and it is an experimental vaccine.
[44:17.420 --> 44:25.420]  It is live. It's not even attenuated. They've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal.
[44:25.420 --> 44:31.420]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and maimed so many.
[44:31.420 --> 44:40.420]  This is just crazy and the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[44:40.420 --> 44:47.420]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the Democrats distribute across the country.
[44:47.420 --> 44:54.420]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[44:54.420 --> 44:58.420]  This is the new world order.
[44:58.420 --> 45:04.420]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[45:04.420 --> 45:14.420]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it
[45:14.420 --> 45:18.420]  and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[45:18.420 --> 45:27.420]  But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[45:27.420 --> 45:34.420]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine,
[45:34.420 --> 45:38.420]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[45:38.420 --> 45:40.420]  It goes on and on.
[45:40.420 --> 45:49.420]  Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation and the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[45:49.420 --> 45:53.420]  But how do you prop up a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going.
[45:53.420 --> 45:58.420]  I wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[46:24.420 --> 46:30.420]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[46:30.420 --> 46:35.420]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[46:35.420 --> 46:45.420]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[46:45.420 --> 46:48.420]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[46:48.420 --> 46:50.420]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[46:50.420 --> 46:53.420]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[46:53.420 --> 47:22.420]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[47:23.420 --> 47:45.420]  We're alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:45.420 --> 47:55.420]  And if you're a radio listener, you've heard me talk some about the record volcanic eruptions that are taking place around the world.
[47:55.420 --> 48:04.420]  But if you're a TV viewer, you can see some clips of the eruptions across the world.
[48:04.420 --> 48:21.420]  From Northern Europe to Southern North America and Mexico to Central America to South America to the Pacific Rim across Asia, Africa, Greece, Italy,
[48:21.420 --> 48:37.420]  Northern Europe, Big Michael Snyder article up on InfoWars.com, just wire volcanoes all over the globe suddenly shooting giant clouds of ash into the air.
[48:37.420 --> 48:43.420]  Well, we know why.
[48:43.420 --> 48:57.420]  The poles of the planet have been dramatically shifting in the last decade and are moving the fastest since we started getting accurate readings of the poles about 200 years ago.
[48:57.420 --> 49:24.420]  And that means that the electromagnetic interactions between the planet and the sun on the magma and nickel core of the planet are manifesting in more tectonic activity up through the core into the mantle and into the crust.
[49:24.420 --> 49:36.420]  And so some environmental groups have come out and said, oh, we're having more earthquakes and more fires in general and volcanoes because of human activity.
[49:36.420 --> 49:40.420]  Well, you could argue that with the fires, but you can't do that with the volcanoes.
[49:40.420 --> 49:45.420]  And they always say climate change is manmade and we're denying climate change.
[49:45.420 --> 49:55.420]  Climate change is the only constant, but to say that mankind and all of our fossil fuel behavior has any effect compared to the sun just isn't true.
[49:55.420 --> 50:05.420]  And it isn't true that the majority of scientists, almost 100% as Jane Fonda said last week, remember they should say 100%, but that got disproven.
[50:05.420 --> 50:17.420]  It'll be the majority that they put at UN events and functions will tell you that climate change is manmade when the studies show not even one half of 1% of climate change is caused by humans and fossil fuels.
[50:17.420 --> 50:28.420]  And one big volcano will put out more fossil fuel, more carbon dioxide and other gases than humans in a whole year.
[50:28.420 --> 50:34.420]  These are massive.
[50:34.420 --> 50:36.420]  The Mount St. Helens blew up.
[50:36.420 --> 50:40.420]  What was it, 1980?
[50:40.420 --> 50:47.420]  The sky was darker for several years, incredible sunsets that affected the temperature of the planet.
[50:47.420 --> 50:51.420]  Many studies showed up to several degrees lower.
[50:51.420 --> 50:56.420]  Now, I know listeners and viewers know all this and the scientists all know this as well.
[50:56.420 --> 51:02.420]  But the idea that we live on a changeless planet and that any change is our fault is absurd.
[51:02.420 --> 51:09.420]  And the idea that if we pay carbon taxes to the literal Rothschild family and the British Row family, that's the main carbon exchange.
[51:09.420 --> 51:17.420]  And then the Chicago exchange owned by Obama, he's a big owner of it, that then that'll save the earth is a fraud.
[51:17.420 --> 51:20.420]  Especially if you believe that carbon dioxide is so evil, a trace gas.
[51:20.420 --> 51:23.420]  Well, if China has unlimited release of it, nobody wants to cut theirs.
[51:23.420 --> 51:25.420]  Why do we have to cut ours?
[51:25.420 --> 51:28.420]  Because it's about economic warfare.
[51:28.420 --> 51:38.420]  It's about control and it's about dumbing people down with the superstition like the ancient Aztecs and the ancient Druids and others did saying,
[51:38.420 --> 51:42.420]  the sun didn't come back today because you've been evil.
[51:42.420 --> 51:48.420]  So do what the priesthood says and people would believe that they were at fault and would do whatever the priest class said,
[51:48.420 --> 51:54.420]  even unto giving the priest class their children in every culture for human sacrifice.
[51:54.420 --> 51:59.420]  In the Old Testament, Abraham stops the practice of human sacrifice.
[51:59.420 --> 52:10.420]  When God says, get your son up here and kill him, your firstborn, that son you wanted so bad.
[52:10.420 --> 52:13.420]  And then God stays his hand and the angel stays his hand.
[52:13.420 --> 52:16.420]  That's because in every other culture in society, that's what went on.
[52:16.420 --> 52:21.420]  Why are we back to this lust of killing babies and killing them after they're born and all the rest of this?
[52:21.420 --> 52:25.420]  Because it's written into the code of the battle going on on this planet.
[52:25.420 --> 52:30.420]  Pharaoh said, give me the firstborn of the Israelites.
[52:30.420 --> 52:35.420]  This is history and the Bible says, give not your children the fires of Moloch,
[52:35.420 --> 52:37.420]  lest you be cursed as a civilization.
[52:37.420 --> 52:45.420]  And now textbooks in California teach 8th graders how to be vampires and drink blood during sex.
[52:45.420 --> 52:54.420]  Because they know that when they get you to do evil things, it allows the hedge of God's interdimensional force field to be removed.
[52:54.420 --> 52:58.420]  And then we become a domain of evil spirits.
[52:58.420 --> 52:59.420]  What are evil spirits?
[52:59.420 --> 53:08.420]  These things we can't see, but science now proves that they're something holding this dimension in that's many times stronger than the dimension that we're in.
[53:08.420 --> 53:09.420]  The dark matter.
[53:09.420 --> 53:13.420]  What we can't see is many estimates 5, 10, 20 times stronger.
[53:13.420 --> 53:17.420]  They can now read it with devices.
[53:17.420 --> 53:23.420]  And they've now proven all these dimensions below and above and around.
[53:23.420 --> 53:24.420]  Multiverse.
[53:24.420 --> 53:33.420]  And there are entities just like there are invisible electromagnetic waves from the sun manipulating the core of the earth.
[53:33.420 --> 53:40.420]  There are all of these unknown things and known things, endless varieties all around us.
[53:40.420 --> 53:47.420]  And it's an electromagnetic, electrochemical, third dimensional universe and we're made out of carbon.
[53:47.420 --> 53:49.420]  And carbon is good.
[53:49.420 --> 53:55.420]  Anyone that tells you carbon is bad, we need to cut the carbon is like a transmission from deep space.
[53:55.420 --> 53:56.420]  Cut your carbon.
[53:56.420 --> 53:59.420]  If we didn't have the carbon, the planet would die.
[53:59.420 --> 54:03.420]  Carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, and sunlight is the carbon cycle on this planet.
[54:03.420 --> 54:09.420]  You remove any of those four things, the planet dies.
[54:09.420 --> 54:14.420]  Carbon dioxide is a trace gas lower than it's ever been in history.
[54:14.420 --> 54:25.420]  And these people are trying to terraform in secret programs now partially declassified to reduce that number.
[54:25.420 --> 54:34.420]  But Sahara Desert is expanding the study show because of lower carbon dioxide from what it was 5,000, 6,000 years ago.
[54:34.420 --> 54:42.420]  There aren't fossils of alligators and crocodiles and camels in the Sahara, crocodiles.
[54:42.420 --> 54:45.420]  It's the bones of them 5, 6, 7, 8,000 years old.
[54:45.420 --> 54:52.420]  The middle of the Sahara Desert was a freaking jungle because plants grow faster and are healthier and higher carbon dioxide.
[54:52.420 --> 54:55.420]  The trick is the planet's dying.
[54:55.420 --> 55:01.420]  And right at the time we found the carbon and sort of putting it back up in the atmosphere.
[55:01.420 --> 55:06.420]  God's plan for us too, geoengineer, and save the planet right at this time.
[55:06.420 --> 55:11.420]  They're trying to shut down that process that God had waiting for us.
[55:11.420 --> 55:19.420]  Now whether you believe in God or not, you understand me that you can look at the studies of lower carbon dioxide and plants dying and deserts expanding.
[55:19.420 --> 55:27.420]  And every policy that these chemtrails, these geoengineering programs are engaged in of aluminum dioxide, barium salts, is doing everything to heat the planet up.
[55:27.420 --> 55:32.420]  And actually lower carbon dioxide and that this is systematically an attack on the planet.
[55:32.420 --> 55:41.420]  If I was an alien species trying to take over the planet and trying to remove the current life on it, this is how I would do it.
[55:41.420 --> 55:46.420]  The Bible tells us that's exactly what it is.
[55:46.420 --> 55:48.420]  And so we know what's causing this.
[55:48.420 --> 55:50.420]  We're in an ever-changing planet.
[55:50.420 --> 55:51.420]  It's always been happening.
[55:51.420 --> 55:59.420]  Anybody that points it and says, oh, it's our fault is a fraud and a liar.
[55:59.420 --> 56:01.420]  The earthquakes are increasing.
[56:01.420 --> 56:04.420]  You can talk about the fires and say, well, humans are doing that.
[56:04.420 --> 56:06.420]  Absolutely, humans usually make their environments better.
[56:06.420 --> 56:15.420]  They've got big studies that show that before humans began to rake the forest and every culture taken the wood and things for fires and cooking,
[56:15.420 --> 56:19.420]  that that caused fire breaks and would actually cause the greening of many areas.
[56:19.420 --> 56:26.420]  And now the Aborigines are saying, you stopped us the last 50 years in Australia from cleaning the forest, scrubbing it's what they call it.
[56:26.420 --> 56:27.420]  Trump calls it raking.
[56:27.420 --> 56:29.420]  The media makes fun of it.
[56:29.420 --> 56:35.420]  And now that's what's causing massive fires to not be contained, is that humans haven't been allowed to do what they always do.
[56:35.420 --> 56:37.420]  And now they're saying, we're going to let them do that again.
[56:37.420 --> 56:39.420]  In California, just talking about fire breaks again.
[56:39.420 --> 56:50.420]  John Boughton has a big report at band.video that gets into is the fires part of an Islamic attack.
[56:50.420 --> 56:52.420]  We know a bunch of Muslims have been arrested here and in Australia setting the fires.
[56:52.420 --> 56:54.420]  We're going to get to that report as well.
[56:54.420 --> 56:56.420]  I'm going to end this hour.
[56:56.420 --> 56:58.420]  Second hour is going to be a bunch of news, your calls.
[56:58.420 --> 57:03.420]  We have an interesting guest, Richard Spencer joining us for a discussion and debate.
[57:03.420 --> 57:09.420]  In the third hour, fourth hour is going to be the biggest medical tyranny news the planet has ever seen.
[57:09.420 --> 57:14.420]  And over the top breakdown, this is not a spectator sport.
[57:14.420 --> 57:17.420]  This is a participation sport and information war.
[57:17.420 --> 57:20.420]  They're now trying to move into even IP address bands.
[57:20.420 --> 57:24.420]  The only way to defeat the globalist is while they're emerging with their takeover to expose them.
[57:24.420 --> 57:26.420]  We're supposed to be censored off the air at this time.
[57:26.420 --> 57:27.420]  We're not.

[59:57.420 --> 1:00:13.220]  Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change based.
[1:00:13.220 --> 1:00:19.020]  Regardless of what the dunces televising from their hollyweird bubble claim, the current
[1:00:19.020 --> 1:00:25.140]  fires in Australia and recently in California aren't simply a result of their UN Agenda
[1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:29.140]  2030 directed Greta Thunberg promoted propaganda.
[1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:37.140]  In fact, a recent Guardian article argues that even though 24 people were charged with
[1:00:37.140 --> 1:00:43.740]  deliberately lighting bushfires, it is in fact global warming that is completely responsible.
[1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:44.740]  The Guardian writes,
[1:00:44.740 --> 1:00:50.500]  �Bot and troll accounts are involved in a disinformation campaign exaggerating the
[1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:54.740]  role of arson in Australia's bushfire disaster.
[1:00:54.740 --> 1:00:57.220]  Social media analysis suggests�
[1:00:57.220 --> 1:01:02.820]  This is further driven home in the article by the social media analysis of Dr. Timothy
[1:01:02.820 --> 1:01:06.500]  Graham from the Queensland University of Technology.
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:12.260]  Graham claims the conspiracy theories going around, including arson as the main cause
[1:01:12.260 --> 1:01:18.540]  of the fires, reflect an increased distrust in scientific expertise, skepticism of the
[1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:23.380]  media, and rejection of liberal democratic authority.
[1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:29.860]  The all-knowing champion of the liberal democratic authority's narrative, Snopes, writes that
[1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:37.380]  the claim that nearly 200 Australians were arrested in late 2019 and early 2020 for deliberately
[1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:43.700]  setting bushfires was false, because even though the statement from the New South Wales
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:51.020]  police stated that since November 8, 2019, 183 people, including 40 juveniles, have been
[1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:58.220]  charged with 205 bushfire-related offenses, the claim of nearly 200 is false, according
[1:01:58.220 --> 1:02:02.820]  to Snopes, because only 24 of those were deliberate.
[1:02:02.820 --> 1:02:08.500]  If you apply this logic, then accidental and burn-band violations, which made up the rest
[1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:12.860]  of the number, are simply a part of the climate change narrative.
[1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:18.820]  An error is now swept into a pile with the climate change narrative propaganda.
[1:02:18.820 --> 1:02:23.940]  Speaking of human error, the Cedar fire was started by a lost hunter setting a signal
[1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:24.940]  fire.
[1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:30.100]  At the time, at least 11 other wildfires were already burning in the region, and what followed
[1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:34.220]  in the hours and days ahead would change our county forever.
[1:02:34.220 --> 1:02:39.980]  The firestorm ultimately claimed 15 lives, including a firefighter, and burned almost
[1:02:39.980 --> 1:02:41.980]  2,400 homes.
[1:02:41.980 --> 1:02:47.660]  Of course, the left would have us all believe that Sergio Martinez did it for climate change.
[1:02:47.660 --> 1:02:53.340]  But no one wants to talk about the dirty secret that Jihad has been and can be waged in the
[1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:54.940]  future through arson.
[1:02:54.940 --> 1:02:59.980]  They have used car bombs, and they've flown planes into buildings to cause massive pain
[1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:00.980]  and destruction.
[1:03:00.980 --> 1:03:04.700]  Well, now Al Qaeda is telling its followers that the American Southwest, that means New
[1:03:04.700 --> 1:03:11.220]  Mexico, is like one big pile of kindling, and that terrorists should burn it down.
[1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:15.020]  Other changes could be on the way when it comes to security here on the campus of St.
[1:03:15.020 --> 1:03:16.820]  Kate's in St. Paul.
[1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:21.740]  This all comes after a former student is accused of lighting several fires across campus, all
[1:03:21.740 --> 1:03:23.180]  in the name of Jihad.
[1:03:23.180 --> 1:03:28.820]  And lo and behold, regarding the Australia bushfires, the Daily Telegraph reported Western
[1:03:28.820 --> 1:03:34.860]  Sydney teen Fadiz Raika, one of the two teens accused of lighting a grass fire at a Guildford
[1:03:34.860 --> 1:03:40.820]  Park while bushfires ravaged New South Wales laughed outside the court today after appearing
[1:03:40.820 --> 1:03:42.420]  on multiple charges.
[1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:47.820]  Breitbart reported that Karash Media, a media organization that supports the Islamic State,
[1:03:47.820 --> 1:03:53.820]  is encouraging ISIS followers to start wildfires in the U.S. and Europe as a new way of waging
[1:03:53.820 --> 1:03:54.820]  Jihad.
[1:03:54.820 --> 1:04:00.460]  The media outlet had been distributing posters that said, ignite fires in the forests of
[1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:04.540]  America, France, Britain, and Germany, for they are painful to them.
[1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:08.180]  Glacier National Park removing those signs around the park stating all the glaciers would
[1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:10.020]  be melted by 2020.
[1:04:10.020 --> 1:04:14.660]  Their opinion shouldn't be swayed by panic, disinformation, and wasteful spending.
[1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:20.740]  As Breitbart reported, the Taxpayers Association released the results of their annual wasteful
[1:04:20.740 --> 1:04:25.780]  spending poll earlier this week, declaring that climate policy had been the biggest
[1:04:25.780 --> 1:04:31.140]  waste of money, largely due to the fact that despite the spending, emissions in Sweden had
[1:04:31.140 --> 1:04:33.300]  actually slightly increased.
[1:04:33.300 --> 1:04:34.300]  No doubt about it.
[1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:39.780]  I won't deny that drought and excessively dry areas lead to massive wildfires.
[1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:45.180]  And the loss of a billion Australian animals and 29 Australians is a nightmare.
[1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:50.300]  But succumbing to the will of the left's cherry picking of the characterization of facts only
[1:04:50.300 --> 1:04:55.220]  suppresses the bigger picture, and that leads us into an inferno.
[1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:57.220]  Wow.
[1:04:57.220 --> 1:04:59.080]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:00.900]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[1:05:00.900 --> 1:05:04.500]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[1:05:04.500 --> 1:05:06.540]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[1:05:06.540 --> 1:05:09.660]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:13.060]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[1:05:13.060 --> 1:05:20.020]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund
[1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:24.300]  the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:25.300]  And so it's very simple.
[1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:29.820]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which
[1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:35.460]  God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort, 110% God will finish the move.
[1:05:35.460 --> 1:05:39.020]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:40.020]  I want to attack.
[1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:41.620]  I want to go after the globalists.
[1:05:41.620 --> 1:05:44.420]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you
[1:05:44.420 --> 1:05:48.020]  and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep
[1:05:48.020 --> 1:05:49.020]  me in the game.
[1:05:49.020 --> 1:05:53.020]  I'm going to buzz my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for
[1:05:53.020 --> 1:06:17.020]  your family, because we're in this together, infoorstore.com.
[1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:33.020]  We are now in the second hour of the January 13th, 2020 Monday transmission with 294 days
[1:06:33.020 --> 1:06:34.020]  left.
[1:06:34.020 --> 1:06:40.660]  Well, we've covered the record levels, earthquakes and volcanoes around the world and the fact
[1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:45.020]  that it's the magnetic poles moving and being affected by changes in the sun, predominantly,
[1:06:45.020 --> 1:06:46.020]  that is causing that.
[1:06:46.020 --> 1:06:50.740]  But I have a whole stack of articles here where environmentalists say humans are causing
[1:06:50.740 --> 1:06:53.900]  the earthquakes and, of course, the volcanoes.
[1:06:53.900 --> 1:06:56.780]  There's nothing these cooks won't say or do.
[1:06:56.780 --> 1:06:59.140]  And meanwhile, we just aired a John Bowne report.
[1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:02.980]  It's a Band-Aid video in the John Bowne section.
[1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:04.380]  Very important needs to get out there.
[1:07:04.380 --> 1:07:12.500]  The only way it will is if you share it, climate changer, arson jihad and snopes says that
[1:07:12.500 --> 1:07:14.300]  we lied.
[1:07:14.300 --> 1:07:19.580]  There haven't been 200 arson arrests and the police didn't attribute most of the fires
[1:07:19.580 --> 1:07:28.780]  in Australia to arson, even though it was a press release from major state police departments.
[1:07:28.780 --> 1:07:29.780]  And they admit we're right.
[1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:36.900]  They just say it's misinformation, what?
[1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:40.580]  That's like when they said in snopes with the big fires last year, they said, Trump
[1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:41.780]  is wrong.
[1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:43.860]  No one rakes the forest.
[1:07:43.860 --> 1:07:51.740]  Well, that's because they know that their Democrat supporters mainly live in compact
[1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:58.460]  cities and don't know how the world really works, and that all over the world, every
[1:07:58.460 --> 1:08:04.900]  culture from Africa, from Australia, from Europe to South America, that people build
[1:08:04.900 --> 1:08:11.700]  fire breaks around their towns and homes and that they get the kindling out of the woods.
[1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:14.500]  So there's not a bunch of fuel there, so there is a lightning strike.
[1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:16.460]  It burns through and doesn't build up a lot of heat.
[1:08:16.460 --> 1:08:23.500]  Get those big, giant 500 foot tall surges going.
[1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:27.980]  That's called forest management, wildlife management.
[1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:33.460]  Never been at a national park that's in scrub brush or whatever, and you see these big berms
[1:08:33.460 --> 1:08:36.500]  that bulldozers built decades before around the buildings.
[1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:43.060]  You ever wondered why there's wrecks when he was like 11 years old, he goes, Daddy,
[1:08:43.060 --> 1:08:48.140]  are those fort walls around this national park down in Big Bend?
[1:08:48.140 --> 1:08:50.900]  He's like, does somebody could climb right over that wall?
[1:08:50.900 --> 1:08:51.980]  Is that like a fort wall?
[1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:52.980]  Like the military?
[1:08:52.980 --> 1:08:55.580]  And I said, no, son, that's against the enemy fire.
[1:08:55.580 --> 1:08:57.740]  That's a fire break.
[1:08:57.740 --> 1:09:01.500]  Like in ships, they build bulkheads to stop water flooding from one to the rest of the
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:04.020]  ship, but also to stop fires.
[1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:08.100]  That's why a lot of houses under zoning have a firewall.
[1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:15.700]  Or if you're in a duplex or apartment complexes, there's by law firewalls, big special walls
[1:09:15.700 --> 1:09:20.700]  that are fire resistant to stop it from burning one and then jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping,
[1:09:20.700 --> 1:09:21.700]  jumping, jumping.
[1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:30.740]  This is all just basic engineering literacy of a five-year-old.
[1:09:30.740 --> 1:09:37.820]  You see, people aren't taught how to do that anymore, but you go down to the Mesoamerican
[1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:43.180]  farmers that have been growing corn down there for 10,000 years, and you'll see around
[1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:47.340]  every town, every little village in the woods and in the forest and the rainforest where
[1:09:47.340 --> 1:09:49.260]  they've cut the fire breaks.
[1:09:49.260 --> 1:09:55.460]  It's because everybody knows it, but again, Snopes and everybody says, we're crazy.
[1:09:55.460 --> 1:09:56.460]  It doesn't exist.
[1:09:56.460 --> 1:09:57.460]  But it was a funny thing.
[1:09:57.460 --> 1:09:58.460]  I saw this article on CNN this weekend.
[1:09:58.460 --> 1:10:03.060]  Oh, the aborigines know how to stop the fires, and I knew before I read it, it'd be, oh, the
[1:10:03.060 --> 1:10:06.140]  aborigines build fire breaks.
[1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:07.140]  There it is.
[1:10:07.140 --> 1:10:09.260]  Indigenous people have a solution.
[1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:13.020]  The country's much fires, and it's been around for tens of thousands of years.
[1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:15.660]  Oh, but wait a minute.
[1:10:15.660 --> 1:10:29.820]  Did I play Colbert and Fallon and everybody else making fun of Trump for raking the forest?
[1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:30.820]  Because that's what you do.
[1:10:30.820 --> 1:10:36.020]  But see, we use coal power now from electricity, to electricity, so people don't have the wood
[1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:40.700]  stove going anymore.
[1:10:40.700 --> 1:10:44.300]  But used to if people just naturally cleared it all out, and look, I know to our audience
[1:10:44.300 --> 1:10:47.980]  it's like I'm telling you two plus two equals four, and they go, Alex, we know this.
[1:10:47.980 --> 1:10:48.980]  We all know it.
[1:10:48.980 --> 1:10:49.980]  I know.
[1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:53.820]  I'm talking to new listeners who are, like, in a high rise in downtown Austin or high
[1:10:53.820 --> 1:11:02.780]  rise in New York, and they literally think that in Texas, we ride horses to work and
[1:11:02.780 --> 1:11:06.460]  that we have outhouses.
[1:11:06.460 --> 1:11:14.160]  No, we have secret nuclear reactors and cyclotrons and superconducting supercolliders and anti-mass
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:18.940]  matter weapons bases and giant nuclear weapons, stockpiles down here, and this is actually
[1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:21.420]  the state that runs the whole damn planet.
[1:11:21.420 --> 1:11:28.420]  So I mean, you know, but again, for somebody in a high rise tube, they just don't know
[1:11:28.420 --> 1:11:29.420]  that.
[1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:32.860]  Like, I'm out here going out to milk the cows every day.
[1:11:32.860 --> 1:11:35.380]  And that's a great thing, by the way, if you can live like that, that's the most healthy
[1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:37.380]  and best way to live.
[1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:43.660]  But the level of ignorance of the trendies and how they don't know which side is up
[1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:46.380]  is very, very dangerous.
[1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:51.260]  And the globalists are playing on that and using that and manipulating it.
[1:11:51.260 --> 1:11:56.660]  And so Paul Watson links directly to the police department press releases and a newscast about
[1:11:56.660 --> 1:12:01.220]  Muslims being arrested and indicted for setting fires, they believe, and they're laughing
[1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:02.420]  outside the courts.
[1:12:02.420 --> 1:12:06.980]  And Muslims are posing in front of Notre Dame laughing and the Guardian says, that's a fake
[1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:07.980]  photo.
[1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:15.100]  And this note says that that's a fake photo, and Paul Wars puts out a fake photo that they
[1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:23.900]  got from Sputnik, the Russians, turns out Sputnik got it from a major photo public library
[1:12:23.900 --> 1:12:24.900]  paid for it.
[1:12:24.900 --> 1:12:27.460]  And we carried it too.
[1:12:27.460 --> 1:12:30.460]  But that's how they operate.
[1:12:30.460 --> 1:12:40.860]  Hell, in just the last few months, they've arrested 98 people.
[1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:45.980]  But Snopes says it's a conspiracy theory.
[1:12:45.980 --> 1:12:47.700]  And they're God.
[1:12:47.700 --> 1:12:49.300]  They say it's false.
[1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:56.100]  Nearly 200 Australians have been arrested in late 2019, early 2020 for deliberately setting
[1:12:56.100 --> 1:13:02.100]  push fires, and it links directly to it, but see, they use that appeal to authority.
[1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:06.100]  And the info was falsely did that.
[1:13:06.100 --> 1:13:07.100]  Total lie.
[1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:18.180]  But see, that's why they want a censored so we can't even respond to them.
[1:13:18.180 --> 1:13:21.820]  And when I was in the latest Sandy Hook depositions, they're just being used as a way to try to
[1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:25.460]  bank represent and get into everything and misrepresent who we are.
[1:13:25.460 --> 1:13:30.620]  They had the Snopes woman there gleefully smiling uncontrollably going in the corner
[1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:37.940]  and then tweeting all this wild disinfo after because imagine that they just hire these
[1:13:37.940 --> 1:13:43.980]  people and you look at their past, it's like, whoa.
[1:13:43.980 --> 1:13:50.780]  And then say you are the proletariat's God, you are the commissar, you are the judge and
[1:13:50.780 --> 1:13:56.580]  jury and executioner, what you say is law like your Moses or something, but that's how
[1:13:56.580 --> 1:13:57.580]  they operate.
[1:13:57.580 --> 1:14:01.180]  All right, I'm going to give the number out when we come back.
[1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:04.420]  I'm going to open the phones up and I'm going to take your calls.
[1:14:04.420 --> 1:14:07.860]  Richard Spencer, the white nationalist, whatever you want to call him, is going to be on the
[1:14:07.860 --> 1:14:12.500]  show and I've got a lot of questions and things for him.
[1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:13.580]  There is a lot of other news.
[1:14:13.580 --> 1:14:18.100]  We have not gotten to a lot of breaking news as well that we'll get to when we come back
[1:14:18.100 --> 1:14:23.460]  a new info wars article by Jamie White, Twitter removes cringy video of Prince Harry pitching
[1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:27.740]  Meghan Merkel to Disney CEO.
[1:14:27.740 --> 1:14:31.820]  I mean, it's just sick, all these little fawning pumps wanting to be famous.
[1:14:31.820 --> 1:14:34.580]  Well, I thought you're royal, doesn't that make you powerful?
[1:14:34.580 --> 1:14:39.020]  Oh, you're so, oh, oh, you're from an immigrant group of weirdo neurotics.
[1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:40.020]  Let me worship you.
[1:14:40.020 --> 1:14:50.700]  So, of course, he wants to be part of the rotting pedophilic edifice that is that's huge facade
[1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:53.420]  behind which these devils lurk that is Disney.
[1:14:53.420 --> 1:15:01.500]  And of course, Facebook Glitch reveals Greta Thunberg's father posing as his teenage mentally
[1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:02.500]  ill daughter.
[1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:03.780]  Of course, he is.
[1:15:03.780 --> 1:15:09.980]  It's all coming up, please do not forget that the new sales are here and they are
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:10.980]  here.
[1:15:10.980 --> 1:15:16.940]  Providing you a chance to get products that really are amazing, a pollen block comes from
[1:15:16.940 --> 1:15:27.700]  a special type of bird quail that is fed a special diet that creates a chemical compound
[1:15:27.700 --> 1:15:28.700]  that's natural.
[1:15:28.700 --> 1:15:34.580]  It's been proven to really help reduce allergies and it's 40% off right now.
[1:15:34.580 --> 1:15:36.940]  I would stock up on pollen block.
[1:15:36.940 --> 1:15:41.900]  You should go research it helps enhance respiratory function helps for healthy sinus function
[1:15:41.900 --> 1:15:46.380]  promotes clear airways, promotes respiratory health and normal breathing supports eye comfort
[1:15:46.380 --> 1:15:47.380]  and sinus health.
[1:15:47.380 --> 1:15:48.380]  Give it a shot.
[1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:51.220]  It funds the info or so you can't lose almost everybody that tries it.
[1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:52.220]  So this is incredible.
[1:15:52.220 --> 1:15:56.220]  It doesn't have all the chemicals, but it works even better pollen block.
[1:15:56.220 --> 1:15:59.260]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:15:59.260 --> 1:16:04.580]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data

[1:17:06.580 --> 1:17:10.900]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:14.220]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:18.100]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:22.260]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:26.740]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:32.780]  lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account

[1:17:49.100 --> 1:17:51.740]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before
[1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:56.740]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:56.740 --> 1:17:58.420]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[1:17:58.420 --> 1:18:00.580]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[1:18:00.580 --> 1:18:02.460]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[1:18:02.460 --> 1:18:07.100]  But I'll be honest with you, we run during the breaks a lot of news reports because
[1:18:07.100 --> 1:18:09.500]  I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:11.220]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[1:18:11.220 --> 1:18:12.220]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[1:18:12.220 --> 1:18:14.500]  But here's the bottom line.
[1:18:14.500 --> 1:18:18.500]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract.

[1:18:42.140 --> 1:18:43.140]  Be part of Crush the Globalist.

[1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:21.740]  There's a solution.
[1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:25.860]  She says to have an abortion.
[1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:27.780]  The mother decides to look into it.
[1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:30.940]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:32.700]  She's made her decision.
[1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:35.140]  She's going to have an abortion.
[1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:41.620]  The problem is that baby is you.
[1:19:41.620 --> 1:19:48.340]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th in Washington, D.C.
[1:19:48.340 --> 1:19:50.340]  Noon at the National Mall.
[1:19:50.340 --> 1:19:51.340]  I'll see you there.
[1:19:51.340 --> 1:19:54.060]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[1:19:54.060 --> 1:20:00.100]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[1:20:00.100 --> 1:20:20.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:27.060]  All right, I want to hit some important news right now, and I'm going to go to a special
[1:20:27.060 --> 1:20:30.420]  report, and I want to open the phones up in the next few segments after that ahead of
[1:20:30.420 --> 1:20:31.700]  Richard Spencer joining us.
[1:20:31.700 --> 1:20:37.260]  I'll be going directly to your calls on the volcanoes, on the impeachment situation coming
[1:20:37.260 --> 1:20:38.260]  up in the Senate.
[1:20:38.260 --> 1:20:40.140]  Will she finally send the articles?
[1:20:40.140 --> 1:20:42.980]  What do they do if she doesn't and violates the law?
[1:20:42.980 --> 1:20:47.100]  What do you make of China producing the majority of our drugs?
[1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:53.980]  What do you make of the situation with what's happening with Iran wanting to topple their
[1:20:53.980 --> 1:20:57.580]  leadership and what's unfolding there?
[1:20:57.580 --> 1:21:02.900]  How far should the U.S. go, if any, to support those people that are being mowed down with
[1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:04.500]  machine guns?
[1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:09.580]  That is all going to be coming up and taking your phone calls on that subject, and if you
[1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:14.980]  have any questions that you'd like to be relayed to Mr. Spencer when he shows up in
[1:21:14.980 --> 1:21:17.580]  the third hour here today.
[1:21:17.580 --> 1:21:26.820]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539, and let's give first-time callers.
[1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:30.300]  That means if you ever called in but didn't get on the air, let's give first-time callers
[1:21:30.300 --> 1:21:39.100]  a chance to be on during this hour, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALIX.
[1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:46.300]  All right, those calls are coming up.
[1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:54.660]  The establishment is obsessed with corrupting our minds and our cellular systems with chemicals,
[1:21:54.660 --> 1:22:01.060]  biological, radiological, to get us off kilter and destabilize so they can basically do what
[1:22:01.060 --> 1:22:05.180]  it is they've been planning to do with the species that has basically forcibly merged
[1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:12.780]  us with machines in a nightmare construction that is a giant satanic ritual against humanity.
[1:22:12.780 --> 1:22:19.340]  Now, I talked about this some yesterday, but I want to play a special report here in just
[1:22:19.340 --> 1:22:24.060]  a few minutes on it, and the report is again at infowars.com.
[1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:30.300]  It is a nationalfile.com story, and the article is important, and it documents what's happening,
[1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:34.980]  and it shows they've now pulled it from the textbook because of pressure, but it focuses
[1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:43.740]  on the anal sex, the bondage, and that, but what it says is body fluid or blood play.
[1:22:43.740 --> 1:22:55.100]  Now, if you go into the definition of blood play, it is part of the whole vampire kingdom,
[1:22:55.100 --> 1:23:01.500]  and again, I'm not saying vampires are real, I'm saying the spirit of people that set these
[1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:07.260]  systems up, and the legends about vampires are based on groups of people going psychotic
[1:23:07.260 --> 1:23:09.060]  and behaving just like this.
[1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:13.020]  That's why they've dug up in ancient Greece and Rome and Egypt.
[1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:20.020]  People buried in walls, big mean adult men usually that have stakes driven to their hearts
[1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:25.940]  and metal stakes in all four arms and legs because they've been known to die and get
[1:23:25.940 --> 1:23:29.900]  back up, whatever's going on there, and they always do the same thing.
[1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:35.060]  Now, Peter Thiel is, quote, very, very interested in young people's blood.
[1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:36.420]  That's an Inc.com article.
[1:23:36.420 --> 1:23:39.980]  He knows there's huge money in it, and it's already the biggest exporter in the world
[1:23:39.980 --> 1:23:44.140]  of children's blood to the planet for rich people taking transfusions, so this is already
[1:23:44.140 --> 1:23:48.740]  going on on an absolutely huge scale.
[1:23:48.740 --> 1:23:50.220]  Here's the vampire lifestyle.
[1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:55.580]  If you just type in blood play, here it is, general beliefs, consumption of blood, sexuality
[1:23:55.580 --> 1:23:56.580]  and sexual practices.
[1:23:56.580 --> 1:24:01.500]  Oh, it's, you know, like bestiality, it's just another thing, sexual activity which
[1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:07.580]  participant deliberately cut to the release blood, and so it's every form of evil being
[1:24:07.580 --> 1:24:13.820]  dumped out upon everyone right now, and full grown women posing as young boys to then go
[1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:18.820]  set up little girls, but that's a new sexual fetish, the media is defending, and sterilizing
[1:24:18.820 --> 1:24:19.820]  your children.
[1:24:19.820 --> 1:24:25.060]  This is all just pure evil because there's an energy release both physically and metaphysically
[1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:26.060]  when they do this.
[1:24:26.060 --> 1:24:28.020]  So here's John Bounds report.
[1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:35.340]  I've known that vampirism, the drinking of blood, is at the heart of Hollywood.
[1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:36.900]  I didn't know that from movies or anything.
[1:24:36.900 --> 1:24:42.860]  I was in some movies, got involved, went there, and had people tell me, and then I saw it.
[1:24:42.860 --> 1:24:48.100]  California textbooks are now teaching eight-year-olds, it broke today, it's on m4s.com, to drink
[1:24:48.100 --> 1:24:54.060]  blood as a sexual preference, and they teach them about blood play.
[1:24:54.060 --> 1:25:04.900]  The mainline news will say in Gillette commercials and on CNN, that if a man is at a mall, or
[1:25:04.900 --> 1:25:09.140]  a man is at a movie theater, or a man is at a dance, and he goes over and says, I think
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:13.420]  you're very attractive, you're so amazing, would you like to dance?
[1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:21.300]  That that's a form of assault, because normal human activity is bad, but if it's unannounced
[1:25:21.300 --> 1:25:26.740]  in many cases, children taken in public schools and libraries and put on the laps, in some
[1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:33.780]  cases of convicted pedophiles, convicted murderers, has come out, well then it's beautiful and
[1:25:33.780 --> 1:25:41.020]  wonderful to have a big fat, ugly man in a dress, grabbing little kids.
[1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:47.420]  That's the power of the media conditioning you to give in to things that are destructive,
[1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:49.500]  because they've got even more horrible things coming.
[1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:52.260]  They're shearing your consciousness.
[1:25:52.260 --> 1:25:58.420]  You know, they shouldn't teach it in school because they're forcing it on them in a way,
[1:25:58.420 --> 1:26:02.060]  and let the kids, you know, beat kids and do their own thing.
[1:26:02.060 --> 1:26:04.300]  However, others are in support of it.
[1:26:04.300 --> 1:26:09.700]  I think the more diverse education we can offer, the more chance we have to inspire
[1:26:09.700 --> 1:26:12.460]  a diversity of students and future leaders.
[1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:17.620]  They say the new sex ed program is too inappropriate, adding the curriculum sexualizes children
[1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:19.980]  as young as kindergarten age.
[1:26:19.980 --> 1:26:24.540]  Last week's state education officials overhauled its sexual education guidance for public
[1:26:24.540 --> 1:26:29.980]  school teachers with gender identity and safe sex practices amongst other subjects being
[1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:30.980]  covered.
[1:26:30.980 --> 1:26:36.260]  Now they say the main one that they are having a hard time with is the LGBTQ inclusive language
[1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:39.500]  and safe trafficking context, which will be covered.
[1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:43.700]  Some parents saying it's all too explicit for kids this young and too graphic.
[1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:49.140]  Now, this includes talking to kindergartners about gender identity, discussing masturbation
[1:26:49.140 --> 1:26:54.180]  in middle school, and teaching safe sex practices for LGBTQ high school students.
[1:26:54.180 --> 1:26:59.100]  Here are some of the signs that some of these parents brought today to sort of talk about
[1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:00.940]  their opinion about this.
[1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:06.500]  Namely, parents are upset about the graphic and descriptive nature of some of the books
[1:27:06.500 --> 1:27:08.620]  included in the curriculum.
[1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:14.180]  The book called Your Health Today has been put on hold in Fremont Unified School District.
[1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:19.660]  It was assigned as a ninth grade health textbook, but more than 2,000 parents and residents
[1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:22.900]  signed a petition calling for the book to be removed.
[1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:28.940]  They're upset over how the book addresses things like sex games, sex toys, vibrators,
[1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:31.100]  handcuffs and ropes.
[1:27:31.100 --> 1:27:35.300]  If your kid goes to public school in California, if you don't want your five year old learning
[1:27:35.300 --> 1:27:40.980]  about transgenderism, too bad, because the director of curriculum frameworks and instructional
[1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:45.620]  resources at the California Department of Education, her name is Stephanie Gregson.
[1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:50.940]  She says, I think that people hear the word transgender or gender identity and guidance
[1:27:50.940 --> 1:27:54.580]  for kindergarten through grade three, and they think the worst.
[1:27:54.580 --> 1:27:58.980]  It's really about civil rights issues.
[1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:02.500]  Since when is bondage a civil rights issue, Stephanie?
[1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:11.260]  But California eighth graders taught anal bondage sex involving blood in sex ed classes.
[1:28:11.260 --> 1:28:18.060]  Now I saw that national file article that was posted up on newswords.com, and I thought,
[1:28:18.060 --> 1:28:22.460]  what the hell is blood play?
[1:28:22.460 --> 1:28:26.780]  Now when I've read about that, that's what vampires call it, when they're killing somebody,
[1:28:26.780 --> 1:28:32.020]  you're torturing somebody to death, and sure as hell, I pulled it up, man.
[1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:36.460]  And it is what you do when you're killing somebody, and playing in their blood when
[1:28:36.460 --> 1:28:39.380]  they kill a baby or whatever, they're rolling around it and all that.
[1:28:39.380 --> 1:28:43.020]  And so, you know, I did a little bit of research on that, and I was something I wanted to forget,
[1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:44.660]  and it was sure as hell going on.
[1:28:44.660 --> 1:28:48.380]  Wait, let me just add, these ragwings working on people, they keep busting?
[1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:51.020]  Turns out they say they're vampires.
[1:28:51.020 --> 1:28:52.020]  That's right.
[1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:53.020]  This is vampires coming after kids.
[1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:54.020]  Period.
[1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:55.020]  That's it.
[1:28:55.020 --> 1:29:01.540]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.
[1:29:01.540 --> 1:29:05.300]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state, until one day I chose to
[1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:06.940]  lead my family to freedom.
[1:29:06.940 --> 1:29:11.340]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool
[1:29:11.340 --> 1:29:14.900]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[1:29:14.900 --> 1:29:18.740]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real
[1:29:18.740 --> 1:29:20.300]  Estate team is here to help.
[1:29:20.300 --> 1:29:46.700]  Go to blackriflerealestate.com, that's blackriflerealestate.com.
[1:29:46.700 --> 1:30:00.980]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste, because I hadn't tried it, except
[1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:05.500]  for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:06.500]  I've ever tried.
[1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:08.540]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[1:30:08.540 --> 1:30:10.340]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[1:30:10.340 --> 1:30:16.500]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:21.220]  I've ever tried, and I'm 45 years old, and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[1:30:21.220 --> 1:30:22.700]  And it's fluoride free.
[1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:26.900]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium, because after
[1:30:26.900 --> 1:30:31.500]  I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[1:30:31.500 --> 1:30:35.660]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this, it feels so good.
[1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:39.780]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[1:30:39.780 --> 1:30:45.060]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[1:30:45.060 --> 1:30:56.820]  a day now because I like the way it feels.
[1:30:56.820 --> 1:31:01.100]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war, but I know you're like me.
[1:31:01.100 --> 1:31:03.020]  You don't want my thanks.
[1:31:03.020 --> 1:31:06.900]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you
[1:31:06.900 --> 1:31:09.340]  want them off your back and off your children's back.
[1:31:09.340 --> 1:31:10.340]  You know what?
[1:31:10.340 --> 1:31:11.340]  I'm the same way.
[1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:12.900]  And that's why we're on the same damn team.
[1:31:12.900 --> 1:31:20.220]  And it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[1:31:20.220 --> 1:31:25.140]  focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future
[1:31:25.140 --> 1:31:28.140]  for humanity and I know you are as well.
[1:31:28.140 --> 1:31:31.940]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war and I want to
[1:31:31.940 --> 1:31:37.260]  thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can for bottom my heart
[1:31:37.260 --> 1:31:39.980]  from my family and from the great crew at info wars.
[1:31:39.980 --> 1:31:44.260]  I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words.
[1:31:44.260 --> 1:31:46.060]  That's reality.
[1:31:46.060 --> 1:31:47.620]  You have made history.
[1:31:47.620 --> 1:31:55.060]  We have made history together info wars.com only has power because of you and I suggest
[1:31:55.060 --> 1:31:56.060]  you use it.
[1:31:56.060 --> 1:32:00.660]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars.
[1:32:00.660 --> 1:32:06.340]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[1:32:06.340 --> 1:32:11.740]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the U.S. worldwide and President
[1:32:11.740 --> 1:32:18.100]  Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:23.340]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[1:32:23.340 --> 1:32:28.340]  but tried to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China.
[1:32:28.340 --> 1:32:33.580]  Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[1:32:33.580 --> 1:32:38.980]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:44.180]  war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:49.220]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[1:32:49.220 --> 1:32:50.220]  at us.
[1:32:50.220 --> 1:32:52.060]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[1:32:52.060 --> 1:33:00.020]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:33:00.020 --> 1:33:20.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:20.140 --> 1:33:26.620]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover ups you want to stop tyranny.
[1:33:26.620 --> 1:33:31.620]  Still so does he live from the info wars dot com studios.
[1:33:31.620 --> 1:33:43.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:43.620 --> 1:33:49.620]  Throughout all of human history that's recorded now even unrecorded for digging up archaeological
[1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:56.220]  areas and finding the same paradigm there are times when we begin to build civilization
[1:33:56.220 --> 1:34:02.580]  based on agrarian systems but then a priesthood within a few generations starts taking control
[1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:11.060]  and within a few more generations human sacrifice and annihilation begins then that population
[1:34:11.060 --> 1:34:17.780]  is exploited to take over the next population to build an empire then it becomes so anti
[1:34:17.780 --> 1:34:22.420]  human and so destructive it begins to collapse back into the jungle or desert from which
[1:34:22.420 --> 1:34:28.620]  it came.
[1:34:28.620 --> 1:34:33.700]  And when people start to adopt this it's oh be tolerant let live and let live but then
[1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:39.980]  as soon as this group replicates itself and gets into control and power of any race color
[1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:43.540]  creed we're all the same same paradigm.
[1:34:43.540 --> 1:34:47.540]  It then comes after the children and tells you you must conform to it.
[1:34:47.540 --> 1:34:56.300]  It's not tolerant at all and for the diversity of the future we're here to groom your children
[1:34:56.300 --> 1:35:01.860]  you heard that quote priest with his rainbow flag around him and he wants to spend some
[1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:09.700]  time with your children wants to help enrich their life he wants to make sure they get
[1:35:09.700 --> 1:35:15.420]  on the right path he wants access to him in that school you don't have a damn thing to
[1:35:15.420 --> 1:35:19.220]  say about it California saying they're going to inoculate children without parental consent
[1:35:19.220 --> 1:35:25.460]  past a lot of do it they say they're coming for your children at every level this is their
[1:35:25.460 --> 1:35:30.420]  system we're going to go to your calls right now I just want to say that the big mega year

[1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:39.380]  going to be able to have a 40% or so because I'm not going to just increase the prices
[1:35:39.380 --> 1:35:42.940]  of things and then cut the price of it to say there's a bigger sale I'm not doing that
[1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:49.660]  gimmick that so many others do but I was talking to one of the office manager's crew last
[1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:54.020]  night and I was talking about how we're sold out of Super Bowl Vitality and how it takes
[1:35:54.020 --> 1:35:59.500]  three months to make more of this proprietary process by a famous outfit in the Utah we

[1:38:29.980 --> 1:38:34.620]  do and became their biggest distributor I had to sign a deal to be a private label or

[1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:30.460]  I can see the calls thank you Kimberly and Jay and Jake and Aaron and Marcus and Alex
[1:39:30.460 --> 1:39:35.420]  and Steve we're gonna get to everybody let's go ahead and talk to Kimberly in Arkansas
[1:39:35.420 --> 1:39:39.060]  what do you think I see you want to talk about what Trump should do with the Iran situation
[1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:42.780]  and the people they're rising up asking us to topple their regime I don't think that's
[1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:46.900]  a good idea who knows what will happen I think what the Secretary of Defense said is they
[1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:51.540]  want to talk to the regime about being a normal country without preconditions I think that's
[1:39:51.540 --> 1:39:57.140]  what we need is engagement what do you think yes I was listening to your show I agree I
[1:39:57.140 --> 1:40:04.060]  was listening to your show last week and Matt Bracken's analysis on what how you think
[1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:11.300]  Trump should proceed which is to not alienate himself from the protesters are the uprising
[1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:21.380]  or the reform that's going on there yes to just make them not see us as the same thing
[1:40:21.380 --> 1:40:28.580]  as their regime leaders that bring them together and let them know how much we appreciate their
[1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:35.300]  reform and help them acclimate themselves to that reform well there's no doubt that
[1:40:35.300 --> 1:40:40.300]  Soleimani was expanding their operations and that he was in a fight with the mullahs and
[1:40:40.300 --> 1:40:43.860]  so that's why the decision was made to kill him seven months ago and this was not done
[1:40:43.860 --> 1:40:50.820]  to wag the dog impeachment's helping Trump Obama and you know others have tried to come
[1:40:50.820 --> 1:40:55.580]  out and say Trump's doing this to wag the dog I don't see any evidence of that no yeah
[1:40:55.580 --> 1:41:02.780]  right now he's the Iranian people appreciate him for what he's you know always enduring
[1:41:02.780 --> 1:41:10.740]  and if he can you know not distance himself from him but help them along their protest
[1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:16.300]  and I can only benefit from it I agree Kimberly thank you so much for the call let's go to
[1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:22.060]  Aaron in Kentucky thanks for holding go ahead sir absolutely Alex thank you very much you
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:27.140]  know one of the biggest things I think Trump needs to do is to get the all of the folks
[1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:30.620]  that are involved in the deep state completely out of his administration and really start
[1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:35.740]  draining the swamp last weekend when he was doing the interview and he said that he was
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:42.540]  given intel that he believed were showing the potential danger of strikes against US embassies
[1:41:42.540 --> 1:41:46.420]  and then Esper came out saying well I've not seen that Intel what I think is happening
[1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:52.380]  is that Trump is being set up there as this kind of crazy eyed man who's just spewing
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:57.900]  off and saying lie I totally agree with you why the hell did I mean even if that was true
[1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:01.940]  he should have said I can't talk about that at this point or something but yeah that was
[1:42:01.940 --> 1:42:07.660]  kind of a throw Trump under the bus moment absolutely and the concern that I have is
[1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:13.500]  that Trump acted on this intelligence and he he took out Soleimani and then when he started
[1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:17.220]  getting a lot of folks from the left attacking him on that and he started saying well it
[1:42:17.220 --> 1:42:20.900]  came from the Intel we got this information from our intelligence community then they
[1:42:20.900 --> 1:42:24.540]  kind of left him out there and they pulled back the his support and just left him out
[1:42:24.540 --> 1:42:29.420]  there to die you know and kind of be crucified by the media I think that that was a direct
[1:42:29.420 --> 1:42:34.140]  and specific attack against Aaron stay there don't get more into this on the side because
[1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:38.940]  I meant to get into that that's in my stack and I I agree with you because he was put
[1:42:38.940 --> 1:42:43.580]  on the execution list over a decade ago he has been connected to launching attacks on
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:48.060]  the US troops he's bragged about it Obama had the kill order out there just never executed
[1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:52.220]  it and so Trump had the authority period to do it but then by them confusing it into
[1:42:52.220 --> 1:42:57.060]  Intel they're going to try to catch him and something false if you understand why the
[1:42:57.060 --> 1:43:03.700]  globalist why the servants of Satan hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive
[1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:09.620]  we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those of us that are
[1:43:09.620 --> 1:43:15.380]  aware of the new order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute
[1:43:15.380 --> 1:43:21.660]  us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:25.780]  the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do
[1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:31.700]  because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[1:43:31.700 --> 1:43:37.820]  destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but
[1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:44.660]  the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we
[1:43:44.660 --> 1:43:51.620]  are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love God and
[1:43:51.620 --> 1:43:59.180]  that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge I spend a lot of time reminding
[1:43:59.180 --> 1:44:05.340]  the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and

[1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:19.900]  ball reviewers but something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these
[1:44:19.900 --> 1:44:24.540]  products are really amazing you've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party
[1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:29.260]  test out there the air filtration the water filtration the supplements are all the very

[1:48:45.580 --> 1:48:49.340]  going to be live action then monday and tuesday if he could not do his show maybe here is
[1:48:49.340 --> 1:48:52.700]  a specific to the morning show and david night can do this one let's just see if he's available
[1:48:52.700 --> 1:48:57.500]  to do that so we've got some monday morning quarterbacking going on here for next week
[1:48:57.500 --> 1:49:02.420]  just planning stuff on air also after we take these calls e removes national flags from european
[1:49:02.420 --> 1:49:07.300]  parliament they're also saying they're going to ban football teams soccer teams having
[1:49:07.300 --> 1:49:12.180]  nationalist names you see and i've got articles i meant to cover that on saturday and friday
[1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:18.460]  headlines in in the uk and the us the word mother woman and girl removed off ads on the
[1:49:18.460 --> 1:49:24.060]  sides of buses because seeing a woman and saying girl is bad a girl is bad see we're
[1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:28.900]  so tolerant we can can't have boys and girls though you're going to be something new now
[1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:34.540]  and a nice fat man in a priest outfits going to tell you what you are now he's your god
[1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:39.740]  but getting back to erin in kentucky recap what you were saying and bring this up because
[1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:42.500]  i've been meaning to say that's why i love to take calls because i forget to get to so
[1:49:42.500 --> 1:49:47.260]  much and absolutely they push him to do all these strikes three times he says no turns
[1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:51.580]  back to aircraft um iran's definitely work with the deep state knowing when trump makes
[1:49:51.580 --> 1:49:54.940]  his move the deep state saying they're going to embarrass trump we know there's all the
[1:49:54.940 --> 1:49:59.260]  shadow diplomacy not just with carrie and obama and hillary but with neocons as well
[1:49:59.260 --> 1:50:03.700]  and they're trying to wait for the impeachment until they get a new article and notice polosi
[1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:08.020]  went maybe i'll bring forward the article that you lied and you didn't have intelligence
[1:50:08.020 --> 1:50:12.540]  that you shouldn't have done this but that didn't work either so she's holding off with
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:19.180]  john bolton and others to get a few other things right before they swing that that that
[1:50:19.180 --> 1:50:25.180]  driver that big iron into trump and boy you can see him hesitate and trying to size him
[1:50:25.180 --> 1:50:30.540]  up in the crosshairs right now and i totally agree with you and this really draws into
[1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:35.020]  question defense secretary espar and just some of the other things he does and when
[1:50:35.020 --> 1:50:39.620]  it comes to trump and i guess they just have no respect for trump and uh you know these
[1:50:39.620 --> 1:50:43.940]  are the guys that that that put solemnity on the list they're the ones pushing for it and
[1:50:43.940 --> 1:50:48.380]  to watch because i've not just i've seen republicans do this i've seen big big republicans senators
[1:50:48.380 --> 1:50:52.420]  that are normally uh you know leave trump alone attacking because they've been told this is
[1:50:52.420 --> 1:50:55.860]  the moment to act against the president i don't think it's going well but what do you expect
[1:50:55.860 --> 1:51:01.460]  next erin uh well i expect for them to continue to feed trump false information and false
[1:51:01.460 --> 1:51:06.300]  intel i mean you have mike Pompeo somebody that that's firmly ensconced in the deep state
[1:51:06.300 --> 1:51:10.620]  who says that his whole purpose at the cia was to lie to cheat and to steal and that
[1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:15.940]  they did classes on that at the cia as well and by the way he quarterbacks the censoring
[1:51:15.940 --> 1:51:21.220]  directly he knows the people and expanded the unit targeting the free press and trumps
[1:51:21.220 --> 1:51:26.820]  underbelly and we it's incredible well national file cover that story last week that you all
[1:51:26.820 --> 1:51:31.300]  broke showing that mike Pompeo was working with the funds of the trump administration
[1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:35.460]  to actively censor information coming out on facebook so it's a scythe up against the
[1:51:35.460 --> 1:51:39.460]  american people and it's a scythe up against the president himself because he's surrounded
[1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:43.900]  by those folks that don't want to see him succeed but i think that was so evident and obvious
[1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:48.220]  this past weekend with mark asper's comments you have you have trump who stood up there
[1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:52.660]  and like you said he has been he has turned back responses to around he's let them do
[1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:56.540]  what they're going to do and he's tried to prevent us from being pulled into any war
[1:51:56.540 --> 1:52:00.500]  but then he gets actionable intel what we see as an imminent threat and he moves upon
[1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:05.580]  that to make a strike and then he's told all of that information was not accurate we didn't
[1:52:05.580 --> 1:52:10.100]  see that information i have no doubt that they're purposely doing this to ensure that
[1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:14.700]  it looks like he is just a neocon warhawk to try to turn away the support he had when
[1:52:14.700 --> 1:52:18.300]  he was saying he doesn't want to draw a draw a send a useless wars especially considering
[1:52:18.300 --> 1:52:21.700]  the fact that after a strike like that and a follow-up in that region you're going to
[1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:26.460]  send troops over to to shore up our defenses to protect our bases to keep our our military
[1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:31.260]  safe and he has to do that well in a response like that so now they're going to use that
[1:52:31.260 --> 1:52:34.580]  to say all well trump said he was anti-war but he's actually sent in and that's why
[1:52:34.580 --> 1:52:39.220]  the media says no war or total war as if there isn't a hundred different points between that
[1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:43.540]  and by bolstering the forces that's how you ensure there isn't a war exactly and you know
[1:52:43.540 --> 1:52:48.820]  and they are what gets me also is the focus on that specific region there are so many
[1:52:48.820 --> 1:52:54.820]  other problems in the world that if the u.s. was going to use our humanitarian force behind
[1:52:54.820 --> 1:52:59.420]  what we could go to to africa where thousands of christians are being killed by islam it's
[1:52:59.420 --> 1:53:02.580]  all you know erin you sound like you work for the state department of pentagon before
[1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:06.700]  you know what you're talking about i've listened to you for years alex you've taught me how
[1:53:06.700 --> 1:53:12.380]  to think so it's it's easy to say that but you know the it shocks me that trump is surrounded
[1:53:12.380 --> 1:53:17.380]  by these folks in the deep state like this i mean steve newton you've got bill bar i mean
[1:53:17.380 --> 1:53:22.700]  bill bar is no champion of patriotism bill bar is is fighting against trump as well and
[1:53:22.700 --> 1:53:26.940]  i think trump is being left out like when king david sent you rya into the forces and
[1:53:26.940 --> 1:53:31.180]  then he pulled back all his support to make sure you rya got killed it looks like that's
[1:53:31.180 --> 1:53:37.020]  what they're doing to president trump in the in the in the global arena right now trump
[1:53:37.020 --> 1:53:41.980]  is extremely anti-war we've seen that we've seen his calls and they wanted that's what
[1:53:41.980 --> 1:53:47.740]  michael moore when he was president elect in 2016 when trump had just gotten elected
[1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:51.980]  michael moore said don't worry there's going to be international military crises and things
[1:53:51.980 --> 1:53:55.780]  coming up and trump's going to be embarrassed and removed because of that and was laughing
[1:53:55.780 --> 1:53:59.740]  about we ought to find where he's i forget i think it was like cnn he said that and so
[1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:03.740]  that's what they're planning to do and these these criminals can't help but brag and and
[1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:08.980]  trump then what does trump do when he's surrounded by these people these double dealers well he's
[1:54:08.980 --> 1:54:14.540]  got to expose them first off right now i even though you're uh around put that 80 million
[1:54:14.540 --> 1:54:18.060]  dollar bounty on his head which is going to be funded by the billion hundred billion dollars
[1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:21.820]  that uh obama sent to him even though they put that bounty on his head if you were to
[1:54:21.820 --> 1:54:25.380]  take out trump right now you would supercharge the movement and they know that they can't
[1:54:25.380 --> 1:54:29.300]  do that so they're going to try to decimate him in the public eye they've done that with
[1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:33.300]  his social life his personal life and the exactly they have to assassinate your character
[1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:37.780]  in your name before they kill you and i'm not trying to look important here but everybody
[1:54:37.780 --> 1:54:42.700]  sees a major national process to do that either put me in prison or kill me after they've
[1:54:42.700 --> 1:54:47.020]  done the demonization tactic to then capture info wars as a symbol turn into something
[1:54:47.020 --> 1:54:52.180]  new as the new word conspiracy theory will be info wars and or alex jones thank you
[1:54:52.180 --> 1:54:56.220]  so much we're not going to let him capture the flag and i'm not trying to say that to
[1:54:56.220 --> 1:55:01.580]  act tough it actually freaks me out they are seeing info wars as a flag and they want to
[1:55:01.580 --> 1:55:06.140]  capture it and then they want to turn it into what they want and i've figured out how they
[1:55:06.140 --> 1:55:10.180]  operate now being in the middle of this and it's crazy and i can't believe we've been
[1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:14.380]  chosen as like a card in the deck a tarot card i mean we have literally been chosen
[1:55:14.380 --> 1:55:17.620]  as an archetype and they're fighting over that archetype right now that's why you've
[1:55:17.620 --> 1:55:22.300]  got to keep us in the game folks because we are the info or we are together we have now
[1:55:22.300 --> 1:55:27.020]  literally gone into lore together what we built here and i'm not just saying that includes
[1:55:27.020 --> 1:55:31.900]  you and pat you on the head you're 99% of us so when i say that i get massive chills
[1:55:31.900 --> 1:55:36.100]  because god's like that's the truth that's the truth tell them that and it's just that's
[1:55:36.100 --> 1:55:40.620]  where we are folks and i don't care about being a mortal danger i don't want them to
[1:55:40.620 --> 1:55:45.940]  capture who i am that's what they're obsessed with rewriting history and oh how the president
[1:55:45.940 --> 1:55:50.180]  will be seen as this or that because they're obsessed with how they steal people's identities
[1:55:50.180 --> 1:55:54.380]  and how they take good men and turn them into bad men even though the man's dead even though
[1:55:54.380 --> 1:55:59.780]  the man's gone even though the person was good they then steal their identity misrepresented
[1:55:59.780 --> 1:56:04.460]  and then use that famous person not for good but for bad okay let's go to uh steam and
[1:56:04.460 --> 1:56:09.460]  florida speaking of that snopes attacking info wars saying there wasn't almost 200 people
[1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:13.620]  arrested for arson even though the police put out the press releases in australia what
[1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:21.420]  do you think about that yes sir it's ridiculous for one thing before i start off i want to
[1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:25.540]  say that i love them for us i love you i've been a listener ever since i was 15 years
[1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:30.580]  old back in 2015 i've had my whole family buy your products if i remember the first thing
[1:56:30.580 --> 1:56:34.180]  i personally ever bought from your website with the hillary for prisoners sticker which
[1:56:34.180 --> 1:56:38.740]  i think you should totally bring back i love it with all my heart um about snopes going
[1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:44.500]  back to the australia flyers it is ridiculous i i just got out of college my college class
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:47.980]  and they're trying to pin i'm not going to stupid climatology class and they're trying
[1:56:47.980 --> 1:56:53.460]  to pin that i'm global warming when it's actually arson ridiculous it's a maliki the misinformation
[1:56:53.460 --> 1:56:59.660]  campaign well that's what's crazy is the police say nearly 200 that's from the police and
[1:56:59.660 --> 1:57:06.660]  then they say i made that up yes sir i i know touching on impeachment one thing the democrats
[1:57:06.660 --> 1:57:11.300]  and i i like to say democrats replace the c with three k because that's all they are
[1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:15.060]  the rain reason why i think they're doing a impeachment is not only for the movement
[1:57:15.060 --> 1:57:20.020]  but also the fact that trump with ever since he walked down the escalators his belief has
[1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:25.300]  been ending illegal immigration and one way to think of illegal immigration is that trump
[1:57:25.300 --> 1:57:30.580]  is trying to make a second abolishment movement he wants to end slavery because when you really
[1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:36.580]  think of what illegal immigration is it's a backdoor under right stay there stay there
[1:57:36.580 --> 1:57:41.580]  let's talk about this and and and then we've also got uh richard spencer coming on so much

[2:00:32.060 --> 2:00:36.380]  a tv viewer info wars dot com four slash show and band out video he's been very upset with
[2:00:36.380 --> 2:00:42.980]  trump and joy bay are in the view said he's now their little cuddle toy their little mascot
[2:00:42.980 --> 2:00:47.260]  I guess he should be a host I think that's funny he should be a host on the show with
[2:00:47.260 --> 2:00:52.220]  them because he now hates trump all he has to do is just shave a little bit off each
[2:00:52.220 --> 2:00:58.460]  side of the mustache there folks and will mine fuel up so so that's all coming up but getting
[2:00:58.460 --> 2:01:05.540]  serious here steven florida you're talking about snopes saying we're lying there weren't
[2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:12.900]  nearly two hundred arrests for setting fires in australia but it says it right there in
[2:01:12.900 --> 2:01:16.700]  the police press release and then you were getting into climate change and where all
[2:01:16.700 --> 2:01:23.820]  this is going go ahead yes sir I was talking about a democrat impeachment hoax it's a scheme
[2:01:23.820 --> 2:01:28.300]  created by polosi and her gang well one thing one thing that I think you guys should make
[2:01:28.300 --> 2:01:33.380]  t-shirts of is the word democrat and replace the c with three k's I think that would be
[2:01:33.380 --> 2:01:38.580]  a big hit because that's what they are the reason why in my opinion why the democrats
[2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:42.940]  are really pushing for impeachment not only is to destroy trump and everything we believe
[2:01:42.940 --> 2:01:49.380]  in but also his trump is on the verge of making a second abolitionist movement he wants to
[2:01:49.380 --> 2:01:56.660]  destroy the democrat undercover backdoor like slave trade where these illegal immigrants
[2:01:56.660 --> 2:02:01.940]  are working in the democrat companies in the democrat field oh they all siphon off of them
[2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:05.500]  they feed off them then it's true the trump said he cut back on the visas for skilled
[2:02:05.500 --> 2:02:08.820]  workers and so Laura Ingham's right to take him to the woodshed on that but I don't have
[2:02:08.820 --> 2:02:12.820]  anything against skilled workers they'll say oh I'm not either they replaced americans no
[2:02:12.820 --> 2:02:16.860]  it'll build the factories here and then americans can get jobs there as well I'm not scared of
[2:02:16.860 --> 2:02:22.320]  indian immigrants because they end up adopting american values I am scared though of the islam
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:26.540]  assistance stuff like that and you're absolutely right trumps trying to get people out of the
[2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:32.260]  and and trump is trying to be a trump is another Abraham Lincoln is trying to make an abolitionist
[2:02:32.260 --> 2:02:35.780]  movement to set these people free because you have to think about the conditions that they're
[2:02:35.780 --> 2:02:39.220]  in I'm not saying they're bad people for the most part they're very no they're not but
[2:02:39.220 --> 2:02:43.460]  they're used as a weapon waters not bad damn breaks but it'll kill you if you're down the
[2:02:43.460 --> 2:02:47.660]  town and don't get a warning exactly and most people don't have safety nets they're working
[2:02:47.660 --> 2:02:52.780]  in the field and they're slaves they're slaves for the hillary clans and they vote how they're
[2:02:52.780 --> 2:02:56.620]  cold and they're brainwashed to be racist and hate white people and so that's why until
[2:02:56.620 --> 2:03:00.620]  that brainwashing stops we have to get control of that and then trump has to bring those folks
[2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:04.740]  out of the shadows and that's what he said he wants to do and just like Abraham Lincoln
[2:03:04.740 --> 2:03:08.380]  was attacked and if you go back in history what they called Abraham Lincoln and made
[2:03:08.380 --> 2:03:11.580]  front of him well they then they killed him because he didn't want to have a horrible
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:15.260]  reconstruction he wanted to make amends with the south and the same groups were like no
[2:03:15.260 --> 2:03:20.540]  we don't want that exactly democrats always have been always will be and forever will
[2:03:20.540 --> 2:03:26.020]  be the party's slavery um so yeah i i think the impeachment is just as the impeachment
[2:03:26.020 --> 2:03:32.140]  hopes the team is a disgrace to our country and it's laughable all right steve we appreciate

[2:04:24.460 --> 2:04:30.860]  at at at trump and so we're going to be talking to richard spencer on the other side of this

[2:06:21.740 --> 2:06:26.300]  since about a year ago when she went trump's a russian agent general flint going public
[2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:33.900]  yay that let's let's go back on the time capsule to that right now breaking news oh my god oh breaking
[2:06:33.900 --> 2:06:40.380]  news abc news brian ross is reporting michael flinn promised full cooperation to the muller team
[2:06:41.500 --> 2:06:46.460]  and is prepared to testify that as a candidate donald trump directed him to make contact with the
[2:06:46.460 --> 2:06:55.820]  russians all the cities will be underwater by 2013 yay well here she is last week talking about
[2:06:55.820 --> 2:07:01.500]  richard spencer when he said he's no longer a trump supporter here it is it was one small thing he was
[2:07:01.500 --> 2:07:06.700]  saying what's some good news this is a tiny thing that i noticed uh you remember richard spencer
[2:07:06.700 --> 2:07:11.100]  he's basically the organizer of unite the right lunatic the white nationalist group that was
[2:07:11.100 --> 2:07:17.020]  marching in shawlsville it was all in for trump not anymore here's his quote he tweeted last night
[2:07:17.020 --> 2:07:23.820]  i deeply regret voting for and promoting donald trump in 2016 oh my gosh wow i mean that's
[2:07:23.820 --> 2:07:29.580]  that's interesting do you know why before is to do with trump like i said yesterday trump ran
[2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:34.140]  on not invading and not being a war that's what i'm talking about this was these people would they
[2:07:34.140 --> 2:07:40.780]  don't okay so uh richard spencer i'm not gonna go over your whole bio they take a while but he's
[2:07:40.780 --> 2:07:45.900]  the president of the national policy institute director of washington summit publishers and
[2:07:45.900 --> 2:07:50.220]  though ban in the uk and for most social networks he can still be found on twitter and youtube at
[2:07:50.220 --> 2:07:56.060]  richard spencer on twitter and on youtube at mpi forward slash radix so um thanks for joining us
[2:07:56.700 --> 2:07:59.820]  i appreciate the fact that you actually come on here even though we disagree about a lot of stuff
[2:08:00.460 --> 2:08:04.540]  give me your current view of president trump from a white nationalist perspective and
[2:08:04.540 --> 2:08:11.980]  why you're angry uh with with trump it is is he not your your furor anymore uh well he was
[2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:17.900]  never a leader but i don't think i need to talk about trump from a white nationalist perspective
[2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:23.340]  i think i could talk talk about trump from a basic american nationalist even conservative
[2:08:23.340 --> 2:08:32.060]  perspective uh he has failed to deliver on the keystone promises of his 2016 campaign
[2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:40.380]  there is no wall immigration restriction is not going to be in the cards uh his policies on
[2:08:40.380 --> 2:08:46.780]  healthcare and many other things are absolutely incoherent what we have been getting has been
[2:08:46.780 --> 2:08:53.660]  the on in domestically the paul ryan agenda of tax cuts for billionaires uh and so on and we've
[2:08:53.660 --> 2:09:00.220]  been getting the george w bush agenda uh in the middle east it's not quite as bad i'll give trump
[2:09:00.220 --> 2:09:08.700]  that uh but it is very bad he is making war in the middle east more likely and that is the exact
[2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:18.540]  opposite of what not just me but what his base of supporters voted for it is true that he said
[2:09:18.540 --> 2:09:24.780]  he was going to cut back the types of visas for skilled workers and then he hasn't done that but
[2:09:24.780 --> 2:09:28.940]  but but he also wants to get new jobs back here in the us that's what the company i i overheard
[2:09:29.500 --> 2:09:36.300]  the tail end of your last conversation and you were both saying well we don't fear h1 bv h1
[2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:44.780]  uh uh b visas uh smart indians or so on well the fact is we actually should care about issues
[2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:51.580]  like that uh the immigration is not simply about illegals or very poor unskilled people coming
[2:09:51.580 --> 2:09:58.380]  across the border there are billions of people who are highly skilled have i high iqs who can come
[2:09:58.380 --> 2:10:05.260]  into the united states and displace the middle class it's in a way worse than low skilled illegal
[2:10:05.260 --> 2:10:14.540]  immigrants doing construction or busboy jobs it's a very serious issue the democrats they want a big
[2:10:14.540 --> 2:10:20.140]  unskilled underclass they can control and i think more smart people will build the country up not
[2:10:20.140 --> 2:10:27.260]  displace the middle class it's having more dumb people that'll destroy us uh i i i would prefer
[2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:33.420]  dumb immigrants to smart immigrants to be frank it is smart immigrants who are taking middle class
[2:10:33.420 --> 2:10:38.540]  jobs who are the ones smart immigrants going up the university of north america go up once europeans
[2:10:38.540 --> 2:10:47.500]  came here well say that again i'm sorry smart immigrants are what built america uh i i agree
[2:10:47.500 --> 2:10:55.420]  to a very large extent but the fact is the united states was since 1790 uh a ultimately a white
[2:10:55.420 --> 2:11:01.020]  country it was a white european country with an anglo- protestant core to it and we brought in
[2:11:01.020 --> 2:11:07.340]  lots of other europeans but that was our identity the fact is i don't i whatever you might think
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:14.140]  about me i do not think that all other races are stupid or incompetent uh to the contrary uh i think
[2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:19.900]  there are hundreds of millions of chinese people who are quite intelligent highly skilled and could
[2:11:19.900 --> 2:11:26.220]  displace uh white people living in north america ask you this question we need to talk seriously
[2:11:26.220 --> 2:11:30.540]  about this sure well i mean the media says it's okay to hit you and attack you and i don't agree with
[2:11:30.540 --> 2:11:35.740]  that and the stuff we hear coming out of the democrats is way more racially based and aggressive
[2:11:35.740 --> 2:11:39.980]  saying white people are inherently bad i mean that's michael morris says whites are bad people
[2:11:39.980 --> 2:11:44.620]  don't trust them they're inherently evil because of the color they are i'm going to see that turning
[2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:49.900]  white people into aggressive race-based individuals because they're not going to have any other choice
[2:11:49.900 --> 2:11:55.180]  if the establishment organizes things into a race-based system uh than just like being in a prison
[2:11:55.180 --> 2:11:59.100]  i wouldn't want to have to go get in the arian wing of the prison but if i did not be killed
[2:11:59.100 --> 2:12:06.780]  because it's been made a race-based system i agree that there's a lot of toxic nasty anti-white
[2:12:07.580 --> 2:12:13.500]  rhetoric and even anti-white discrimination policies that are emerging from the democratic
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:19.020]  party i would also say that the gop does next to nothing to actually fight these they'll talk about
[2:12:19.020 --> 2:12:25.180]  let me ask you this i mean undoubtedly you're a moderate compared to the democrat leadership
[2:12:25.180 --> 2:12:29.580]  saying whites are inherently evil i mean you're not saying people are inherently evil or agents
[2:12:29.580 --> 2:12:34.220]  are inherently evil so here's the deal i disagree with a lot of stuff but i just want to say if
[2:12:34.220 --> 2:12:39.180]  you're a villain for being race-based then you're like a little demon compared to cnn that satan
[2:12:39.180 --> 2:12:44.380]  himself if we judge things as being race-based is evil then then then you are a very small evil
[2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:52.700]  uh thank you alex i'll i'll take that let's be honest about that let's but my big beef with you but
[2:12:52.700 --> 2:12:56.940]  i don't hear what you think first is that you're synthetic and you're working for the globalist
[2:12:56.940 --> 2:13:03.180]  but but please continue i'm not uh synthetic or working for the globalist but uh what i was
[2:13:03.180 --> 2:13:07.900]  saying before was that there is a lot of nasty rhetoric coming from the democratic party and
[2:13:07.900 --> 2:13:16.300]  there's anti-white discrimination policies however we there is a a basis for identity politics
[2:13:16.300 --> 2:13:22.860]  that isn't just a globalist plot or isn't just some bad policy from the democratic party the
[2:13:22.860 --> 2:13:31.020]  fact is we live in a globalized world uh we don't live in a world where your your consciousness
[2:13:31.020 --> 2:13:37.820]  is formed by your neighborhood or maybe your small nation state at most we actually live in a world
[2:13:37.820 --> 2:13:45.100]  where we have a global consciousness and the the major fissures of this upcoming war are going to
[2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:53.100]  be racial and cultural so you are a white man whether you like it or not you are perceived
[2:13:53.100 --> 2:13:59.020]  as a white person uh by say the globalist or the establishment but also by immigrants by
[2:13:59.020 --> 2:14:06.300]  migrant uh by refugees and migrants and etc our identity is forced upon us in this time
[2:14:06.300 --> 2:14:10.380]  but we need to recognize that the globalists want to make everything not identify with the
[2:14:10.380 --> 2:14:15.500]  ideology of freedom and americana that could unify us they want to make it racially based
[2:14:15.500 --> 2:14:20.140]  force whites into a race-based system and and and and then have that war in that fissure and
[2:14:20.140 --> 2:14:24.380]  that's how i see you playing in as the other side of the left trying to make it race-based
[2:14:24.380 --> 2:14:28.780]  and now you're saying okay it is race-based which things have always been tribal and race-based
[2:14:28.780 --> 2:14:33.820]  and so under christianity we would transcend that model so i'm in i'm in a debate about those two
[2:14:33.820 --> 2:14:38.460]  models i think it's okay to have that discussion and it's not good to say that whites are inherently
[2:14:38.460 --> 2:14:45.340]  bad while the left pushes a race-based system you are correct about that i'm saying you how
[2:14:45.340 --> 2:14:51.660]  did you come upon your ideas your system who you are and what you're pushing for right first real
[2:14:51.660 --> 2:14:59.420]  quick if we as white people unilaterally disarm we will be crushed in this upcoming world we need
[2:14:59.420 --> 2:15:04.380]  to be proud of ourselves we need to fight back we need to be tough guys and this is something
[2:15:04.380 --> 2:15:08.620]  that you should get because one thing that i really like about you despite my criticisms
[2:15:08.620 --> 2:15:13.980]  is that you are a bold tough man's man and that's a good thing the white race needs to be like this
[2:15:13.980 --> 2:15:19.020]  we need to stop apologizing for ourselves we need to stop just you know beating around the
[2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:24.060]  bush on issues and we need to be proud of who we are and fight for who we are but in terms of how
[2:15:24.060 --> 2:15:31.500]  i came to these ideas uh look uh i i come from a great background i had a wonderful childhood
[2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:36.860]  i have wonderful parents i could have just gone in and become a lawyer and made a lot of money
[2:15:37.660 --> 2:15:41.820]  but i wanted to talk about that when we come back because because of like four of the five
[2:15:41.820 --> 2:15:46.460]  united right rallies we're all former democrats that's why i'm suspicious i want to talk about
[2:15:46.460 --> 2:15:57.580]  your roots your ethos when we come back maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon you'll

[2:17:58.220 --> 2:18:09.740]  the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[2:18:10.540 --> 2:18:17.580]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even
[2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:24.300]  attenuated they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did
[2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:31.500]  with the garter cell vaccine that's admittedly killed in me so many this is just crazy and the
[2:18:31.500 --> 2:18:36.620]  congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in
[2:18:36.620 --> 2:18:42.380]  the last few years oh and of course opened the borders up here and letting people in unvetted
[2:18:42.380 --> 2:18:48.220]  the democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[2:18:48.220 --> 2:18:56.380]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america this is the new world order knock on wood i am not
[2:18:56.380 --> 2:19:02.220]  tempting fate but everybody around the office especially folks that have worked there a long
[2:19:02.220 --> 2:19:09.020]  time have noticed that i really don't ever get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow because i
[2:19:09.020 --> 2:19:13.580]  just made that statement i'm not tempting fate i'll say that again because i am superstitious
[2:19:13.580 --> 2:19:18.140]  when it comes down to that i'm very thankful for the good lord for the constitution i've been given
[2:19:19.020 --> 2:19:25.500]  but up until about eight nine years ago when i started taking x2 and the products in force
[2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:31.260]  life i i still got sick every couple years and you know i still get sore throats from allergies
[2:19:31.260 --> 2:19:37.580]  and pollen and things like that but now that i religiously take the products to them for
[2:19:37.580 --> 2:19:43.180]  worse life with the highest quality supplements you're gonna find out there i just never get a fever
[2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:51.420]  anymore it's probably been three four years since i've had a fever it's just crazy so i
[2:19:51.420 --> 2:20:17.420]  chalk up genetics and the great products you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:17.420 --> 2:20:22.220]  remember the violence launched against nationalist christians the right wing trump supporters
[2:20:23.180 --> 2:20:28.620]  korean visiting wearing trump pass getting beat up in dc it's because you're all nazis if you
[2:20:28.620 --> 2:20:33.500]  support trump but they trained everybody by showing richard spencer saying he's a nazi
[2:20:33.500 --> 2:20:37.420]  and then saying it's okay to punch a nazi and then once that was okay well it's okay to attack
[2:20:37.420 --> 2:20:46.460]  everybody else that's how this brainwashing works here's that famous clip it's uh pepe's become kind
[2:20:46.460 --> 2:21:02.700]  of a symbol okay so richard spencer's here with us and it's interesting to actually talk to him
[2:21:02.700 --> 2:21:07.580]  himself and hear things from his view so let's get into your ethos and the fact that you know i've
[2:21:07.580 --> 2:21:13.260]  got some of the background here it's classic you know cutout type deal and and i can't prove that
[2:21:13.260 --> 2:21:17.900]  but then you guys have to unite the right rally we're sorosins and all these people there's this
[2:21:17.900 --> 2:21:24.460]  big clash and then out of that they blame trump and then most of the leadership of it were like
[2:21:24.460 --> 2:21:28.860]  i've had some imams some of your buddies like well it is true a year ago i was supporting obama but
[2:21:28.860 --> 2:21:33.820]  not now or yes i supported hillary two years ago but now i agree with richard spencer and we're
[2:21:33.820 --> 2:21:39.260]  and it just looks like the left creating a group to then identify with trump to say oh look he's a
[2:21:39.260 --> 2:21:45.020]  white nationalist so there's a rena mob out there saying that and doing that i mean i'm not saying
[2:21:45.020 --> 2:21:48.060]  there aren't real white nationalists or white supremacists out there but it seems like the
[2:21:48.060 --> 2:21:52.460]  media and the left and their attempt to say whites are inherently bad and and do all this
[2:21:52.460 --> 2:21:57.740]  crazy racist stuff is to create this dialectic where you take the problems and you collide them
[2:21:57.740 --> 2:22:04.460]  together to create the synthesis what do you think's really going on here and i mean who are you
[2:22:04.460 --> 2:22:13.180]  really first off i did not organize the charlottesville rally i was invited to speak at it and i was a
[2:22:13.180 --> 2:22:22.460]  top build guest etc but in terms of what went wrong in charlottesville we need to look directly at
[2:22:22.460 --> 2:22:29.340]  the city of charlottesville and the state of virginia that brought in militarized police police
[2:22:29.340 --> 2:22:38.300]  that were pushing me around at lee park and then they allowed chaos to ensue the fact is i
[2:22:38.860 --> 2:22:45.020]  yes whenever there's a protest some kind of you know vista cuffs is is possible but there was
[2:22:45.020 --> 2:22:51.420]  absolutely no reason for downtown white foot downtown charlottesville to descend into absolute
[2:22:51.420 --> 2:22:58.460]  chaos that was terrible you need to look there i don't know about george soros sending in people
[2:22:58.460 --> 2:23:04.780]  in terms of my own personal background i've never been a democrat i have i voted for john
[2:23:04.780 --> 2:23:11.340]  carrey in 2004 for reasons that i might very well vote for a democrat again in 2020 supporting
[2:23:11.340 --> 2:23:17.100]  obama working for obama a year before he organizes this rally charlottesville well he
[2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:24.060]  he seems to have a lot of ideas rattling around in his head i don't know if he knows who he is
[2:23:24.060 --> 2:23:29.100]  uh but i can only support obama one year and then the next thing and you're organizing a
[2:23:29.100 --> 2:23:35.020]  white nationalist event i mean it's not terribly it's not terribly uh unusual for people particularly
[2:23:35.020 --> 2:23:39.180]  young people to kind of go off in different directions but i can't i'm not in touch with
[2:23:39.180 --> 2:23:42.940]  him i can't speak to him did you know the southern prairie law center was running the elaheem city
[2:23:42.940 --> 2:23:48.380]  facility white supremacist compound where mcvay was and all that that came out in court uh i did
[2:23:48.380 --> 2:23:55.100]  not know that uh i i would not be surprised uh that there are dirty tricks and false opposition
[2:23:55.100 --> 2:24:01.180]  like that created uh the fact is that is not who i am period okay well let's get an opportunity to
[2:24:01.180 --> 2:24:05.260]  say you are go back to your your beginnings or ethos and what what made you become this person
[2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:12.300]  now that the media's chosen is kind of the new david duke right uh i think that you and i might
[2:24:12.300 --> 2:24:18.460]  have similar origins in the sense that at a young age as we were becoming adults we realized that
[2:24:18.460 --> 2:24:25.900]  there was something wrong with the world and we were looking for a way to articulate it uh you
[2:24:25.900 --> 2:24:32.940]  went into a world which i i don't of looking at globalist and conspiracies and false opposition
[2:24:32.940 --> 2:24:38.620]  and all of that kind of thing and i think there's actually a lot of truth to uh what you say uh
[2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:45.900]  there's a lot of untruth too but that's all right um i wanted to understand why my people in our
[2:24:45.900 --> 2:24:54.220]  civilization have been so demoralized why we are not able to stick up for ourselves and our people
[2:24:54.220 --> 2:25:01.100]  and think about our future why we are so eager to unilaterally disarm why we have this black
[2:25:01.100 --> 2:25:08.220]  cloud hanging over our heads whether it's slavery or the holocaust or or so on and it's preventing
[2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:15.660]  us from acting on our own interest from being great from going to the stars uh to put it most
[2:25:15.660 --> 2:25:23.180]  vividly uh and i wanted to understand that that guilt complex that is always weighing us down
[2:25:24.140 --> 2:25:29.420]  i i don't know what it is about me but i don't like to keep my head down i always like to be out
[2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:36.540]  in front i like to be bold and i was i was willing at a young age to talk about these issues
[2:25:36.540 --> 2:25:42.060]  openly even if it brought controversy uh to go back a little bit earlier when you showed that
[2:25:42.620 --> 2:25:49.100]  image of me getting punched uh and you were saying oh they were creating a dialectic well
[2:25:49.100 --> 2:25:57.740]  the fact is donald trump created a dialectic donald trump was calling upon race even if he
[2:25:57.740 --> 2:26:05.180]  wouldn't use that word specifically because he he told us directly particularly the r and c that i
[2:26:05.180 --> 2:26:11.660]  am your man i am going to stick up from americans americans have dreams to immigration is out of
[2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:18.780]  control i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna be your guy this was implicitly it was explicitly nationalist and
[2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:25.340]  let's be frank it was an implicitly racialist because america has been a white country for
[2:26:26.380 --> 2:26:31.900]  its entire political history that's what donald trump was about he was actually calling upon
[2:26:31.900 --> 2:26:38.060]  these energies in a way that no other republican would he was calling for unity and saying those
[2:26:38.060 --> 2:26:42.940]  that want to divide us and say america is bad or wrong and it's okay for america to exist and
[2:26:43.660 --> 2:26:49.660]  all of our traditions are good and we celebrate those but it was a very unification uh you know
[2:26:49.660 --> 2:26:55.740]  event as well i mean he was up there at the r n c with a rainbow flag but he also went and march
[2:26:55.740 --> 2:27:00.300]  in pro-life events something no republicans done he's trying to i mean he really seems pragmatically
[2:27:00.300 --> 2:27:05.980]  trying to be a unifier but also stand up for human life uh and and get the irs off churches backs
[2:27:05.980 --> 2:27:09.740]  because they have no place you know being there under the first amendment i mean i i just don't
[2:27:09.740 --> 2:27:16.620]  that's i think what you were massively divided uh at the united states of 1950 could have been
[2:27:16.620 --> 2:27:21.740]  unified in a kind of nationalist message and we were to a very large degree fighting the cold war
[2:27:21.740 --> 2:27:28.540]  we are polarized and we are polarized down racial lines to a very large degree and it's not just
[2:27:28.540 --> 2:27:36.060]  even a matter of polarization of a or b the country is fragmenting into small communities that don't
[2:27:36.060 --> 2:27:41.340]  cross that and so like a vaccine of racism they have the left being totally racist and it's wrong
[2:27:41.340 --> 2:27:47.100]  and needs to be decried but that's meant to have the autoimmune response of whites aligning upon
[2:27:47.100 --> 2:27:53.580]  race just like a warden controls a prison through race that's all but we're gonna have to accept
[2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:58.460]  this reality we're not gonna come up with some nice republican conservative leader who's gonna
[2:27:58.460 --> 2:28:04.060]  unite the country that that is more ridiculous than any you know outlandish thing i've ever
[2:28:04.060 --> 2:28:07.500]  said i don't know i don't know i mean quote minorities are huge listeners and supporters of
[2:28:07.500 --> 2:28:10.940]  this show and i run into them and they get what's going on and they want the american dream they
[2:28:10.940 --> 2:28:19.340]  don't care what color they are i'm sure you can find individuals like that but the general
[2:28:20.620 --> 2:28:26.060]  indians indians indians that are citizens are like a highest level of trump supporter i just
[2:28:26.060 --> 2:28:31.180]  don't i just don't i'm not buying what you're saying i see the media trying it and i see you
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:34.460]  as playing the part on the other side of you don't know but let's come back longer segments right
[2:28:34.460 --> 2:28:37.500]  ahead i'll try to give you the floor for at least five minutes at the start and see what you have
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:41.580]  to say because i appreciate your courage coming on the show but this is what's happening we're
[2:28:41.580 --> 2:28:47.500]  being told it's a reality be racial and then it's not about ideas anymore that define us it's all
[2:28:47.500 --> 2:28:53.980]  about race that define us and then the globalists have won but you'll see what happens if you're
[2:28:53.980 --> 2:28:59.580]  trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs listen to me you don't know me and we'll never
[2:28:59.580 --> 2:29:05.500]  meet i had a problem like you once i drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of
[2:29:05.500 --> 2:29:12.460]  control and almost ruined my life i realized i needed help to fix my problem before it totally
[2:29:12.460 --> 2:29:18.780]  destroyed me if you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone
[2:29:18.780 --> 2:29:24.620]  you need to call the national treatment advisors they'll immerse you into a 30-day program to
[2:29:24.620 --> 2:29:30.460]  replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life and if you have ppo
[2:29:30.460 --> 2:29:36.140]  private health insurance the entire program may be covered fix your problem right now before it
[2:29:36.140 --> 2:29:52.780]  gets any worse get clean call now and learn more 800 506 6740 800 506 6740 that's 800 506 6740
[2:29:55.260 --> 2:30:02.220]  it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[2:30:02.220 --> 2:30:09.180]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[2:30:09.180 --> 2:30:17.660]  right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still by concentration
[2:30:17.660 --> 2:30:24.220]  camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it
[2:30:24.220 --> 2:30:28.940]  doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when you
[2:30:28.940 --> 2:30:34.380]  take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your
[2:30:34.380 --> 2:30:40.460]  immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's
[2:30:40.460 --> 2:30:47.820]  mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the
[2:30:47.820 --> 2:30:53.260]  giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now
[2:30:53.260 --> 2:30:59.340]  you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush some skulls politically you want to
[2:30:59.340 --> 2:31:04.540]  drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually there's nowhere you can spend money there's
[2:31:04.540 --> 2:31:11.660]  nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar your bang
[2:31:11.660 --> 2:31:18.780]  for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system
[2:31:18.780 --> 2:31:23.500]  where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy and so it's very simple if you
[2:31:23.500 --> 2:31:28.700]  don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which god wants to see
[2:31:28.700 --> 2:31:34.860]  you see we have to make the effort 110 god will finish the move and i know i need to stay in the
[2:31:34.860 --> 2:31:40.060]  fight in the attack attack attack i want to attack i want to go after the globalist and just believe
[2:31:40.060 --> 2:31:43.580]  me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all
[2:31:43.580 --> 2:31:48.140]  of our futures together you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game i'm gonna bust my ass with
[2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:52.860]  everything i got for us for myself my family for your family because we're in this together info
[2:31:52.860 --> 2:32:00.060]  or store dot com info or store dot com we have a new product and we got several thousand of these
[2:32:00.060 --> 2:32:03.900]  in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them want to thank the
[2:32:03.900 --> 2:32:09.580]  listeners for getting it but this really is a game changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete
[2:32:10.220 --> 2:32:15.020]  with super blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult
[2:32:15.020 --> 2:32:19.820]  or the children's these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers
[2:32:19.820 --> 2:32:25.740]  people love it this is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that
[2:32:25.740 --> 2:32:32.860]  also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in
[2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:37.420]  it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis this is all proven you can make claims with this
[2:32:37.420 --> 2:32:43.420]  but i have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses
[2:32:43.420 --> 2:32:49.740]  uh and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud
[2:32:49.740 --> 2:32:54.380]  of it it funds the operation info or store dot com that's why we're still on air thanks to you
[2:32:57.660 --> 2:33:00.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:00.380 --> 2:33:11.340]  so
[2:33:16.060 --> 2:33:23.820]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:33:23.820 --> 2:33:31.420]  war anybody that studied the british great game in india another divide and conquer
[2:33:32.060 --> 2:33:39.340]  stratagems knows that globalists promote getting rid of any nation's indigenous culture
[2:33:39.340 --> 2:33:46.540]  and replacing it with the plastic corporate system of control and then they push racial unity but
[2:33:46.540 --> 2:33:52.780]  then exploit that and create more division and tribalism and so i know that the american system
[2:33:52.780 --> 2:33:59.180]  and the christian system that actually stops slavery worldwide and reform things is the antidote
[2:33:59.180 --> 2:34:06.780]  to that so the globalists are trying to destroy that ethos and get europeans to abandon that so
[2:34:06.780 --> 2:34:12.140]  that we don't have a unified system a pro-human operating system but a globalist operating
[2:34:12.140 --> 2:34:18.380]  system a post-human operating system and then the wars that's that and then the cultural clash
[2:34:18.380 --> 2:34:23.820]  that's going to come out of this the globalists will end up on top at the end of it it doesn't mean
[2:34:23.820 --> 2:34:26.940]  that the racial-based politics aren't real things happening it doesn't mean you couldn't
[2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:31.980]  organize yourself into a racial unit against that and that's one way to defend against it
[2:34:31.980 --> 2:34:37.180]  i'm trying to stop the whole thing for the future of humanity period and i see the democrats again
[2:34:37.180 --> 2:34:43.020]  invoking total racial war and saying whites are inherently bad because the obvious move is going to
[2:34:43.020 --> 2:34:49.020]  be racial division forcing people into those groups and then the collapse of what was western
[2:34:49.020 --> 2:34:55.020]  civilization and so obviously the west was manipulated to totally open up with its ethos
[2:34:55.020 --> 2:35:01.020]  to then destroy that plan and so i'm all for shutting down the borders and until the brainwashing
[2:35:01.020 --> 2:35:07.020]  stops getting people to be pro-america pro-western or or they can't come in that's my measure to
[2:35:07.020 --> 2:35:13.020]  stop going into full-scale race war which the globalists want but then we've got Richard Spencer
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:19.020]  here who the media has chosen to kind of be the new david duke uh and uh and and so he's got a lot
[2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:23.020]  of followers and is in the media a lot and so i thought we'd get him on the show to have a real
[2:35:23.020 --> 2:35:28.220]  discussion i also invite the racist black and hispanic groups on uh but the brown berets won't
[2:35:28.220 --> 2:35:32.220]  come on they're all funded by the ford foundation the black racists the groups really won't come on
[2:35:32.220 --> 2:35:38.220]  the show maybe we should get quant lx on from houston or something maybe he'll come on but uh
[2:35:38.220 --> 2:35:42.220]  this is all the same stuff over and over again but but spencer i've talked enough we got eight
[2:35:42.220 --> 2:35:48.220]  minutes to break go ahead and uh give us your spiel well well let's talk a little bit about
[2:35:48.220 --> 2:35:56.220]  what the globalists want and the kind of human being they want to inhabit this planet um you've
[2:35:56.220 --> 2:36:01.220]  talked a little bit before about divide and conquer they want to inspire racialism and so on
[2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:09.220]  um i i don't think we actually have to look too far to understand what globalists want because we
[2:36:09.220 --> 2:36:17.220]  see it every day they want an undifferentiated mass of humanity uh that all on a planetary scale
[2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:25.220]  all eating mcdonald's and shopping and charging things on credit and all thinking exactly the same way
[2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:35.220]  i agree actually it gets even worse they want that version of globalism that is not what i want
[2:36:35.220 --> 2:36:43.220]  i want you could call civilizatialism or identitarianism or racialism in the sense that we have real
[2:36:43.220 --> 2:36:51.220]  we have real unified cultures that that have a that are part of an historical tradition and can look
[2:36:51.220 --> 2:36:59.220]  to a future that is connected to their past i don't want to turn the planet into a giant shopping mall
[2:36:59.220 --> 2:37:07.220]  i want europeans to be european to pursue our path i want africans to be african i want indians to
[2:37:07.220 --> 2:37:15.220]  be indian i want them to rediscover themselves that is what i am about that being said there is a element
[2:37:15.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  of globalism to this the fast the fact is uh through the internet i mean we could go back to the 19th
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:29.220]  century and talk about trains and the telegraph we have developed wider conscious uh a wider consciousness
[2:37:29.220 --> 2:37:36.220]  than just our little tribe uh or even our nation states we care about what's happening on the other side
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:41.220]  of the world i mean let's say it is they can continue let's say it is and then you can continue the christian
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:47.220]  western ethos was the white man's burden to build a civilization to develop technology to go into all
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:53.220]  these countries and really not exploit people empower them build them up give them science those populations
[2:37:53.220 --> 2:37:59.220]  explode then the modern corporation technocrats turn against that exploit the third world racially
[2:37:59.220 --> 2:38:05.220]  turn them against the christian ethos erase the christian ethos and then bring the whole thing down and
[2:38:05.220 --> 2:38:12.020]  so uh the white man's christian quote burden of expansionism did empower in many ways the third world
[2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:17.220]  that explode their populations but now that's being used as a weapon against what's left of the west
[2:38:17.220 --> 2:38:25.220]  what the globalist want is a kind of secular grotesque version of christianity in the sense
[2:38:25.220 --> 2:38:33.220]  of a universalist individualist mass of consumers there are people on the left there are people
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:39.460]  on the right who instinctively reject that and want something different i think to a large degree
[2:38:39.460 --> 2:38:44.100]  that was what the trump movement was about even though it's it's obviously been betrayed and is
[2:38:44.100 --> 2:38:50.100]  and is useless now that's what i'm about that's what actually some people on the left are about even
[2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:56.580]  if they oppose me and are against me they actually are motivated by those kinds of instincts and
[2:38:56.580 --> 2:39:05.700]  emotions there is a a revolt against globalism in this form of a of a secularized undifferentiated
[2:39:05.700 --> 2:39:12.100]  mass and there is an attempt to to create civilizations that are connected to their past
[2:39:12.100 --> 2:39:18.260]  and have a future but the only thing i would add is that this isn't going to be about
[2:39:19.060 --> 2:39:24.980]  getting away from the world or just you know bunkering down in a little nation state we do
[2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:30.260]  have a globalist consciousness at this point even you do everyone who rages against globalist
[2:39:30.260 --> 2:39:34.180]  does we care about what's happening on the other side of the world we find that we have a tremendous
[2:39:34.180 --> 2:39:41.380]  amount of common ground with people like us around the planet so we've we've got to get away kind of
[2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:49.460]  from the nationalist globe globalist divide and move towards a a synthesis of of a civilizational
[2:39:49.460 --> 2:39:57.460]  racial consciousness and that is how the world is breaking down there are major fissures in this
[2:39:57.460 --> 2:40:03.140]  economically globalized world and those are on the basis of civilization and race and culture
[2:40:03.140 --> 2:40:10.100]  in the deepest sense of the word now richard you know at the highest levels of the global system
[2:40:10.100 --> 2:40:17.540]  they're actually very very racist um and and but it's scientific how they go and they study each
[2:40:17.540 --> 2:40:20.820]  group and only want the smartest from each group and then that's the excuse to recruit all the
[2:40:20.820 --> 2:40:27.300]  scientists for this project of further dumbing people down in things so they can just accelerate
[2:40:27.300 --> 2:40:31.780]  this program get rid of the bad sons to make sure there's not a challenge to the hegemonic
[2:40:32.900 --> 2:40:39.460]  system of the technocrats but globalization or us being global in our thought are international
[2:40:39.460 --> 2:40:45.380]  citizens that's not the globalist the globalist are corporate technocrats that want to enslave
[2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:51.060]  humanity destroy the nation state and kill all cultures and have one unified monotheistic uh
[2:40:51.060 --> 2:40:55.140]  stinking you know corporate thing that you were just talking about okay with creatures like
[2:40:55.140 --> 2:41:00.340]  michael moore inhabiting it so so so that's not what i'm saying when i say i oppose globalist
[2:41:00.340 --> 2:41:08.660]  i'm saying i oppose that authoritarian planetary corporate rule i do too absolutely and but it's
[2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:16.100]  we need to think in these big terms uh that that is basically what i'm putting forth in as a challenge
[2:41:16.100 --> 2:41:21.620]  we need to think geopolitically we need to think about the future of the planet environmentally
[2:41:21.620 --> 2:41:31.060]  and we need to understand ourselves as europeans as a broader people on this planet with a particular
[2:41:31.060 --> 2:41:38.580]  destiny and a particular charge well there's no doubt that the closest thing to hitler is ms
[2:41:38.580 --> 2:41:46.100]  nbc i mean that's just but but from the position that that you say that white people what well but
[2:41:46.100 --> 2:41:54.180]  let me explain that ms nbc has the purest hitler message i've ever seen it's just from the perspective
[2:41:54.180 --> 2:42:00.020]  that whites are bad instead of other groups are bad from from an arian or uh nordic perspective
[2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:06.740]  i mean you you tune into that man it's it's socialist it's it's anti-white uh it it's it's
[2:42:06.740 --> 2:42:14.660]  it's it's hitler but from the other perspective uh and surely i mean you see that uh i i i i i
[2:42:14.660 --> 2:42:20.100]  i i kind of get what you're saying i i think that's a bit over the top so do you like to say it
[2:42:20.100 --> 2:42:28.500]  like that what do you like hitler uh hitler is just a man from history a a major figure like
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:37.300]  napoleon or jingus kahn he's uh we need to understand where we are right now and what our our consciousness
[2:42:37.300 --> 2:42:41.060]  and also our challenge is going to be very different than the challenge those that don't know history
[2:42:41.060 --> 2:42:45.380]  you're doomed to repeat it and history doesn't ride great it does repeat well let's talk about
[2:42:45.380 --> 2:42:55.780]  hitler the real hitler on the other side stay with us i've got to really hand it to the listeners
[2:42:55.780 --> 2:43:02.500]  and viewers who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the
[2:43:02.500 --> 2:43:08.100]  globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide
[2:43:08.100 --> 2:43:14.660]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[2:43:14.660 --> 2:43:20.740]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[2:43:20.740 --> 2:43:25.860]  but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[2:43:25.860 --> 2:43:32.180]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[2:43:32.180 --> 2:43:38.580]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a
[2:43:38.580 --> 2:43:42.900]  big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[2:43:42.900 --> 2:43:48.740]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize
[2:43:48.740 --> 2:43:56.900]  us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy hey you there we have a problem
[2:43:57.780 --> 2:44:05.700]  you see there is a baby the mother of this baby is not sure she's ready the father of this baby
[2:44:06.420 --> 2:44:14.180]  doesn't want to settle down the mother starts to have regrets the father considers leaving town
[2:44:14.180 --> 2:44:23.860]  but a friend says there's a solution she says to have an abortion the mother decides to look
[2:44:23.860 --> 2:44:31.220]  into it the clinic assures her it's safe she's made her decision she's going to have an abortion
[2:44:31.940 --> 2:44:35.300]  the problem is that baby is you

[2:46:45.940 --> 2:46:54.180]  have made history together info wars dot com only has power because of you and i suggest you use it
[2:46:54.180 --> 2:47:20.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[2:47:20.900 --> 2:47:28.820]  all right the next hour i'll go to the callers to stop from alex and jason and jad on other
[2:47:28.820 --> 2:47:33.300]  topics i've got the big report with the un admits vaccines are tainted are killing people and they
[2:47:33.300 --> 2:47:36.980]  are covering it up it's incredible from inside the highest levels of the un
[2:47:39.940 --> 2:47:45.220]  you know i found history very interesting when i was young and i stopped reading as much pulp
[2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:51.780]  fiction when i was probably about seven eight years old i started reading world war two encyclopedias
[2:47:51.780 --> 2:47:56.420]  world war one encyclopedias uh because my parents when i would just see it on tv they'd order me
[2:47:56.420 --> 2:48:01.300]  any time life encyclopedias i wanted so it got kind of insane still got some of them around here
[2:48:02.020 --> 2:48:05.700]  so by the time i was about 12 i was reading rise and fall third right order of the death
[2:48:05.700 --> 2:48:10.900]  said hind sobel you know pretty high level you know uh uh treatise on things and then i
[2:48:10.900 --> 2:48:17.300]  read a lot of other histories other parts of the world and things like that and you know history
[2:48:17.300 --> 2:48:22.580]  is all you know different angles and there's a lot of disinformation there but in the main line
[2:48:22.580 --> 2:48:27.620]  history of world war two if you go back into world war one the treaty of resize the rest of it
[2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:32.740]  it's actually in the text uh all the secret societies and the subgroups battling and the
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:36.980]  plan for the e you the hitler ad and put the floor out in the water to dumb people down so it's all
[2:48:36.980 --> 2:48:42.020]  there in mainline Pulitzer prize winning books so when they play dumb on the news like oh flora
[2:48:42.020 --> 2:48:46.100]  it's good for you jones is crazy all the intellectuals and all the researchers know what's really
[2:48:46.100 --> 2:48:53.060]  going on birchland rustle wanted to nuke major you know populations to get rid uh of too many people
[2:48:53.060 --> 2:48:58.180]  to save the earth he had his own competing you know racial hitlerian thing he said we'll just use
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:49:06.180]  vaccines to dump everybody down diet injections and injunctions so hitler wasn't completely controlled
[2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:11.620]  he thought he was his own guy but british intelligence set him up helped get him in power
[2:49:11.620 --> 2:49:16.900]  that's why he thought he had secret treaties and and deals uh with uh edward the eighth it was
[2:49:16.900 --> 2:49:21.380]  going to be the e you king that's why they had secret treaties uh with the british after the
[2:49:21.380 --> 2:49:27.060]  expeditionary force and duncurt and why uh they didn't take out the british x ministry force and
[2:49:27.060 --> 2:49:32.420]  let him get off the beach just put a show on that all came out and then hitler got double crossed
[2:49:32.420 --> 2:49:36.660]  by the british empire uh and then he said well hell i at least better take out the communists
[2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:42.020]  before they get me so hitler really thought he was doing good very crazy guy obviously from world
[2:49:42.020 --> 2:49:46.980]  war one and child abuse and all the rest of it but the globalists create these dialectics and they
[2:49:46.980 --> 2:49:51.620]  were so advanced the globalism comes out of cecil roads and the british empire that's the model of
[2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:55.540]  it so i don't want to say it's an anglophile conspiracy it's just that that's the anglophile
[2:49:55.540 --> 2:49:59.780]  system that projected so much power that it you know created the skeletal structure of this larger
[2:49:59.780 --> 2:50:06.260]  system and so hitler was a creation then set up to destroy europe and then bring down that model
[2:50:06.260 --> 2:50:10.660]  but then bring in the scientific behind the scenes model uh that ibm and others were there
[2:50:10.660 --> 2:50:15.620]  propping up hitler so that's the real world and so if you don't think richard spencer and i'm not
[2:50:15.620 --> 2:50:21.780]  saying you're a hitler that that you are controlled you just need to watch out and understand that you
[2:50:21.780 --> 2:50:26.900]  might be more controlled than you think uh by the system by how they promote you and other things
[2:50:26.900 --> 2:50:31.380]  because you're helping create one part of that dialectic clash that they're wanting i mean
[2:50:31.380 --> 2:50:39.220]  have you ever thought about that um fair enough yeah i i've certainly thought about bad actors
[2:50:39.940 --> 2:50:46.660]  and uh what role i might play in a in a bad scheme of course but i mean i i can tell you
[2:50:46.660 --> 2:50:53.700]  very seriously i am for real i am passionate about these ideas i care about our future
[2:50:53.700 --> 2:51:00.660]  and i'm my own man uh so that's all i can say i i mean for better and for worse i'm not funded by
[2:51:00.660 --> 2:51:07.540]  a bunch of globalists uh but the fact is uh we probably need a pro white soros out there uh we
[2:51:07.540 --> 2:51:14.260]  actually are going to need billionaires in order to fund a serious movement for social change we
[2:51:14.260 --> 2:51:20.580]  can't just back away from the stage of history and say ah we just want individual freedom and
[2:51:20.580 --> 2:51:27.860]  constitutionalism and so on uh no uh we are actually going to need major actors in this play
[2:51:27.860 --> 2:51:32.820]  we're going to need people behind the scenes and funders in order to accomplish this and
[2:51:32.820 --> 2:51:38.100]  we need to get serious about that and realistic about it well michael moores i'm going to put
[2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:41.940]  a clip in a few minutes says that you can't trust white people they're inherently bad
[2:51:42.660 --> 2:51:48.580]  and right i mean that's an extremely racist statement very hitlerian um and so you would be
[2:51:48.580 --> 2:51:55.220]  mild compared to him and i guess would be the response to that but again pulling back from
[2:51:55.220 --> 2:52:01.540]  that you say we're going to need a soros soros was a nazi collaborator did help round up fellow
[2:52:01.540 --> 2:52:06.500]  jews and he said it was the best time of his life on 60 minutes so isn't it funny that the guy
[2:52:07.060 --> 2:52:11.140]  you say is the polar opposite i guess of what you're trying to do actually work for the nazis
[2:52:11.140 --> 2:52:19.460]  look soros had a obviously a strange life history and and soros also has a bit of a
[2:52:19.460 --> 2:52:27.220]  complicated relationship with say israel or the american foreign policy establishment he opposed
[2:52:27.220 --> 2:52:35.540]  the iraq war it's a complicated story but the notion that george soros is pro-white or or or
[2:52:35.540 --> 2:52:43.060]  racialist uh in some in some way is completely ridiculous i agree with you part of the dialectic
[2:52:43.060 --> 2:52:51.860]  he's he's the other side of what you know okay uh but uh he he has a lot more power than i do
[2:52:51.860 --> 2:52:57.620]  he is a lot he's affecting the world in a way that i'm not we can just look at what's happening
[2:52:58.660 --> 2:53:04.420]  and and determine what he wants i mean look i can come on your show i can do a broadcast here and
[2:53:04.420 --> 2:53:10.340]  there uh george soros is someone who is acting on the world stage right now we can look at the
[2:53:10.340 --> 2:53:15.460]  effects of what's happening is what's happening that white people are becoming greater and we're
[2:53:15.460 --> 2:53:21.220]  flourishing to new degrees or becoming more powerful of course not all white countries the
[2:53:21.220 --> 2:53:26.660]  populations within them are being displaced and as you pointed out to your credit we're being dumb
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:33.940]  down we're being demoralized we're being taught to hate ourselves and our history uh that is what's
[2:53:33.940 --> 2:53:39.620]  happening that is clearly what i know there's no there's no doubt there's an all-out war on white
[2:53:39.620 --> 2:53:43.940]  people and a genocide of the culture i'd be against that for any group but i'm saying it's part of a
[2:53:43.940 --> 2:53:52.340]  dialectic to inoculate white people to then enrage them into a hitlerian paradigm uh well i do think
[2:53:52.340 --> 2:53:58.500]  there is going to be a big reaction uh when white people give us your view of the future and what you
[2:53:58.500 --> 2:54:05.700]  think is kind of unfold i i think my immediate view of the future is basically more of the same
[2:54:05.700 --> 2:54:11.220]  the united states is suffering from a kind of white death the deaths of despair people who have
[2:54:11.220 --> 2:54:19.060]  who are hooked on drugs and have no sense of the the future whatsoever and are are literally and
[2:54:19.060 --> 2:54:25.140]  figuratively just killing themselves i i think there is going to be more of this in the future
[2:54:25.140 --> 2:54:31.380]  but there will be a reaction to this here i i guess i kind of agree with you in the sense that
[2:54:32.260 --> 2:54:39.460]  there will be a point in which white people start collaborating together working together as a team
[2:54:39.460 --> 2:54:44.500]  and start forging their own destiny they we start we stop unilaterally disarming myself
[2:54:44.500 --> 2:54:50.980]  ourselves and we understand that there is power and and collective action there's a team is going
[2:54:50.980 --> 2:54:57.940]  to destroy any individual opponent and we will eventually start acting like that if they stand
[2:54:57.940 --> 2:55:02.980]  up for second amendment or their families or pro-life or against communism that they're racist
[2:55:03.780 --> 2:55:08.260]  yeah but all that's kind of individualism at some level you know it's it's about saying
[2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:13.860]  oh we don't want this state power uh we we just want to be left alone and all that kind of stuff
[2:55:13.860 --> 2:55:19.300]  all that kind of stuff is weak at the end of the day uh the fact is we're never going to be left
[2:55:19.300 --> 2:55:24.820]  alone we should just get that out of our minds and we probably won't leave other people alone
[2:55:24.820 --> 2:55:32.260]  we need to embrace collective power and state power we need to rise to this challenge as opposed to
[2:55:32.260 --> 2:55:37.380]  just saying oh just leave me alone it'll be okay give me my rights or things like that
[2:55:37.380 --> 2:55:42.500]  we need to start being the bad asses of history again people who are pushing history in the right
[2:55:42.500 --> 2:55:47.700]  direction we need to rise to that challenge well i think people in general need to push a pro-human
[2:55:47.700 --> 2:55:51.380]  future because an anti-human future is being built and i'm trying to organize people against the
[2:55:51.380 --> 2:55:57.780]  machine uh anti-human globalist takeover that that these technocrats admit in their own megalomania
[2:55:57.780 --> 2:56:01.940]  which they're actually building because we've acquiesced our destinies period and are laying
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:06.740]  down as humans and if you look at what you were just talking about uh and and the people committing
[2:56:06.740 --> 2:56:11.620]  suicide and the death at everywhere and white's leading that it is because there is a racial
[2:56:11.620 --> 2:56:16.260]  attack on whites being directed by the filth and the scum in hollywood and the globalist
[2:56:16.260 --> 2:56:22.500]  combine who are the enemies of all humanity right you know we need a pro-human future a human
[2:56:22.500 --> 2:56:28.100]  future where we don't just talk about you know the economy or rights or something but we talk
[2:56:28.100 --> 2:56:34.340]  about the kind of world we want to live in i want a pro-nature future as well i think one of the
[2:56:34.340 --> 2:56:40.900]  major um uh catastrophes and one of the biggest challenges is for us to make sure that this is
[2:56:40.900 --> 2:56:47.300]  a livable planet for our children and if we just simply talk about you know the rights of business
[2:56:47.300 --> 2:56:53.780]  men to you know pollute the oceans and destroy the forest we're never going to get there we actually
[2:56:53.780 --> 2:57:01.460]  have to rise to this challenge and have an end goal directed uh a movement uh but yes globalism
[2:57:01.460 --> 2:57:05.780]  is destined to fall it's already in a massive crisis do five more minutes with us after this
[2:57:05.780 --> 2:57:10.420]  break i want to ask you do you think globalism as it's known they're admitting it's basically

[2:58:48.340 --> 2:58:53.860]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate
[2:58:53.860 --> 2:59:00.180]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[2:59:00.180 --> 2:59:06.980]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail
[2:59:06.980 --> 2:59:13.140]  eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in
[2:59:13.140 --> 2:59:18.980]  published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable
[2:59:18.980 --> 2:59:24.980]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective
[2:59:24.980 --> 2:59:30.500]  it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[2:59:30.500 --> 2:59:35.700]  activity of tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[2:59:35.700 --> 2:59:42.180]  in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
[2:59:42.180 --> 2:59:58.100]  of our pollen block chewable tablets you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:01.380 --> 3:00:05.140]  first thing i'm gonna do is take your phone calls and go to the side of this next break
[3:00:05.140 --> 3:00:15.060]  then i'm gonna hit all the other news the just incredible information the un's highest
[3:00:15.060 --> 3:00:19.700]  scientists admitting that it's killing people and they're covering up what goes on it's not tested
[3:00:19.700 --> 3:00:24.980]  wow um so that's coming up out of the war with on shroyer well richard spencer i got to say uh
[3:00:24.980 --> 3:00:28.660]  you actually had a discussion with me david duke just wanted to score points and talk about jews
[3:00:28.660 --> 3:00:32.820]  all day uh and i and i would have him back on i want to have controversial people on the show
[3:00:32.820 --> 3:00:39.620]  it just it just turns into uh you know trying to like score points to another person uh but
[3:00:39.620 --> 3:00:44.740]  but i appreciate you coming on the show and uh are you going to be in virginia next week i'm
[3:00:44.740 --> 3:00:50.580]  going to be there in dc at the women's march well i might come down if you're there sure well i'd
[3:00:50.580 --> 3:00:54.740]  like to interview if you are i think that'd be a good on camera interview very thought-provoking
[3:00:54.740 --> 3:01:00.580]  because again i mean compared to the left right now you're like an anti-racist thank you you're
[3:01:00.580 --> 3:01:05.940]  right well i mean i'm serious i mean i'm really scientific about this i'm pro-human i really
[3:01:05.940 --> 3:01:09.700]  don't want to release the bio weapons the right specifics and that's really what the globalists
[3:01:09.700 --> 3:01:13.540]  are planning on this dialectic and the west is going to be so overrun and so down that
[3:01:13.540 --> 3:01:18.020]  they're going to want a large group people to acquiesce and agree to wiping out all the non-whites
[3:01:18.020 --> 3:01:22.980]  and i really just don't think i'm going to go to heaven if i do that uh that's absolutely not what i
[3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:27.540]  want uh i want there to be a future for africa i want there to be a future for asia and india
[3:01:27.540 --> 3:01:31.940]  uh but also a future for europe and a future for white people but can you see how the globalists
[3:01:31.940 --> 3:01:36.980]  want to elicit that massive clash they want to have that good or domino on that battle of the gods
[3:01:38.020 --> 3:01:45.140]  well i agree i think there is a kind of apocalyptic quality to do this i think there's a apocalyptic
[3:01:45.140 --> 3:01:51.060]  current uh within white people in north america with the popularity of in time conspiracies and
[3:01:51.060 --> 3:01:56.260]  christian zionism and and so on i i think these are all very bad things i i think we need to
[3:01:56.260 --> 3:02:03.780]  to uh think about having a flourishing human future absolutely one thing we could talk about is
[3:02:04.340 --> 3:02:07.780]  the the question you asked before the break which is the you know what's going to happen with
[3:02:08.580 --> 3:02:16.180]  the globalism as it is the the way that i would think about this is that the united states
[3:02:16.180 --> 3:02:22.020]  is an empire it's a different kind of empire than say the british empire the french or
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:29.860]  or austro-hungarian empire things like that uh it's based more on financial globalism and it
[3:02:29.860 --> 3:02:38.020]  has zionism as a component of it as an indispensable component of it as well but it's been a more or
[3:02:38.020 --> 3:02:44.900]  less consensual empire i mean since 1944 and the bread and woods accords uh the there's been
[3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:49.940]  dollar hegemony in the sense that this is how everything is effectively priced for you know
[3:02:49.940 --> 3:02:56.820]  oil in particular and uh the united united states has again it's gained its legitimacy by by seeming
[3:02:56.820 --> 3:03:03.540]  to be pro democratic and and and pro you know markets and things like this i think that the
[3:03:03.540 --> 3:03:09.940]  united states empire in the coming years is going to become more like empires of old and we saw this
[3:03:09.940 --> 3:03:16.260]  recently with the controversy in the iraqi parliament in which iraq wanted the us troops out
[3:03:16.260 --> 3:03:22.180]  america kind of said or seemed to say okay right we'll obey you and then now they are
[3:03:22.180 --> 3:03:26.740]  effectively saying absolutely not we're gonna kick you out of the dollar system if you even
[3:03:26.740 --> 3:03:32.820]  think about this kind of well what you're saying there is true and then on on top of that uh any
[3:03:32.820 --> 3:03:37.860]  country trying to get off the dollar ends up getting attacked yeah oh well i mean that that
[3:03:37.860 --> 3:03:42.660]  might have been one of the motivations behind knocking off qaddafi in libya uh saddam hussein
[3:03:42.660 --> 3:03:48.740]  also made noises about moving to a a non-dollar system for pricing of oil so that is massive
[3:03:48.740 --> 3:03:52.660]  what about Trump doing nothing about the iraq censorship dionism as well what about
[3:03:52.660 --> 3:03:56.420]  Trump doing nothing about internet censorship that's a huge failing uh he's monitoring the
[3:03:56.420 --> 3:04:01.460]  situation as you know alex uh even though it would be a political winner just to go out there
[3:04:01.460 --> 3:04:08.420]  and say that look we don't have to agree with everyone uh but as a us citizen you have a right
[3:04:08.420 --> 3:04:14.580]  to this new public space which is social media uh he could do that people on a boycott a big tech
[3:04:14.580 --> 3:04:19.460]  he could say that but he does nothing and you talk about authoritarianism that's where you see america
[3:04:19.460 --> 3:04:25.460]  losing its real power not in weapons or money but our ideas and freedom and if we abandon that it's
[3:04:25.460 --> 3:04:30.980]  absolutely uh true and then we've got michael moore uh you know again saying white's inherently bad
[3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:35.860]  making you more like martin ruther king uh than michael moore and i'll play that clip after you're
[3:04:35.860 --> 3:04:39.460]  gone for folks who think i'm joking all right richard spencer very interesting discussion please
[3:04:39.460 --> 3:04:44.740]  come back again richard v spencer uh on twitter for now alex jones is not there all right thank
[3:04:44.740 --> 3:04:48.820]  you richard spencer very interesting very thoughtful about you we'll be right back stay with us
[3:04:52.900 --> 3:04:59.540]  the globalists know that i will never willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give in
[3:04:59.540 --> 3:05:07.540]  i will never give up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing
[3:05:07.540 --> 3:05:14.500]  all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most
[3:05:14.500 --> 3:05:20.660]  americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadowband
[3:05:20.660 --> 3:05:27.460]  by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[3:05:27.460 --> 3:05:34.260]  have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and band on video
[3:05:34.260 --> 3:05:38.660]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey
[3:05:38.660 --> 3:05:43.700]  the band truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com forward slash show
[3:05:43.700 --> 3:05:48.980]  in band on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down
[3:05:48.980 --> 3:06:04.900]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square
[3:06:13.540 --> 3:06:17.620]  all right well i think we should have open discussions with people even though we disagree
[3:06:17.620 --> 3:06:24.180]  with them and you got to hear what richard spencer really thinks um i think he's being used by the
[3:06:24.180 --> 3:06:29.460]  establishment to create vulcanization obviously even if he doesn't know that but compared to the
[3:06:29.460 --> 3:06:33.300]  soundbites i've seen i'm not a hundred percent sure now maybe we should have him back again and
[3:06:33.300 --> 3:06:41.940]  take calls and see what you think um there's a movement to end humanity as we know it a post human
[3:06:41.940 --> 3:06:46.740]  move and that's attacking the little boys attacking the little girls they don't care what car you are
[3:06:46.740 --> 3:06:54.420]  they're attacking the children and it's good versus evil and it's absolutely true that whites
[3:06:54.420 --> 3:06:59.860]  are under attack and that the left is pushing it with the marxist linus agenda but i believe
[3:06:59.860 --> 3:07:03.380]  we're smart enough to expose that and change that that doesn't mean we should be proud of
[3:07:03.380 --> 3:07:07.540]  we are no matter what color we are and stand up for ourselves and people try to guilt us
[3:07:07.540 --> 3:07:12.740]  into submitting to their political agenda because we're white i don't care what color you are you
[3:07:12.740 --> 3:07:17.940]  need to stop laying down the globalist bullying and globalist pushing garbage and i can just look
[3:07:17.940 --> 3:07:24.420]  at the metrics and i can tell you statistically we get as much support or a little bit higher
[3:07:24.420 --> 3:07:30.340]  from hispanic americans than we even get from white people so um because we can see the numbers we
[3:07:30.340 --> 3:07:33.860]  have the analytics i don't tailor my message according to analytics i just tell you what i
[3:07:33.860 --> 3:07:39.380]  really feel as a human and people resonate with it um but uh we have a very high percentage of black
[3:07:39.380 --> 3:07:44.580]  folks that listen to the show asian people and the indians i mean when exposed to this people
[3:07:44.580 --> 3:07:49.780]  want freedom that's what people want to come to america and that doesn't mean we just bring in 100
[3:07:49.780 --> 3:07:54.340]  million people in 10 years and you know no no you can't because the left's brainwashing them to be
[3:07:54.340 --> 3:07:59.620]  racial and hate whites you absolutely can't because the majority of people being brought in right now
[3:08:00.180 --> 3:08:04.740]  are being totally made dependent and brainwashed and used to drive down wages and to be racially
[3:08:04.740 --> 3:08:13.540]  based but people that have been here a generation or two now i don't care what color they are they
[3:08:13.540 --> 3:08:19.700]  get what's going on and generation z shows that that is the least white generation in american
[3:08:19.700 --> 3:08:25.700]  history uh and in all the polls of studies they're the most conservatives see how that works and it's
[3:08:25.700 --> 3:08:32.980]  not because they're brown it's because they're living in this clash and they see that it's a load
[3:08:32.980 --> 3:08:39.300]  of crap now that doesn't mean you become a leftist bleeding heart and run around apologizing you know
[3:08:39.300 --> 3:08:45.460]  you know because you're white to counter this and you don't then run around and put swastika
[3:08:45.460 --> 3:08:49.780]  armbands on either in my view you say damn it here's the scam they're running don't we want
[3:08:49.780 --> 3:08:54.820]  to be smart enough to not do this and be a bunch of idiots and then if we fail and 20 years from
[3:08:54.820 --> 3:08:59.940]  now i'm in some white redoubt with my family because i've got to be and a giant group of people
[3:08:59.940 --> 3:09:03.700]  that aren't wider coming to kill me i'm gonna fight and fight hard damn well you better believe it
[3:09:03.700 --> 3:09:08.820]  they choose to be racial they choose to run their flags that way they want to fight they'll get one
[3:09:10.340 --> 3:09:15.860]  but that'll be a group of non whites that have decided to come at me because i'm white it won't
[3:09:15.860 --> 3:09:19.220]  be all the other brown people that didn't choose to be with that pirate horde
[3:09:21.860 --> 3:09:25.220]  but that's exactly where this is and the left to have something called a broken
[3:09:25.220 --> 3:09:35.300]  coalition strategy all these atomized alone people that they then throw together and right now they're
[3:09:35.300 --> 3:09:41.620]  using the attack training doll of white people and whites need to reject it and get in the face of
[3:09:41.620 --> 3:09:46.500]  it and get in the face of the left pushing racialism and a total abandonment of christianity and
[3:09:46.500 --> 3:09:56.020]  marluther king jr and everything and absolutely get in its face and if he'll talk the racist
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:10:03.700]  left then talk spencer would talk i talked to him i've in fact listeners should recommend the racist
[3:10:03.700 --> 3:10:09.060]  minority leaders we should get on but all but behind almost all of them are white
[3:10:09.060 --> 3:10:15.700]  phd ford foundation folks you know ford was the second biggest supporter of hitler in the world
[3:10:16.660 --> 3:10:21.700]  it wasn't germany it was ibm and it was ford still like ford cars not against him i got a
[3:10:21.700 --> 3:10:29.300]  ford truck henry ford was a wild man and he really supported hitler he also supported the
[3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:36.420]  working person a lot of other stuff and he put his 30 something million dollars when he died into
[3:10:36.420 --> 3:10:41.380]  the ford foundation people go boy it sure is different than henry ford the you know ford was
[3:10:41.380 --> 3:10:51.140]  a nazi but he supports all this leftist stuff but you think a guy like that didn't put the money
[3:10:51.140 --> 3:10:56.740]  where he wanted it he wants a racial division to then trigger this big rising up that he believes
[3:10:56.740 --> 3:11:04.500]  will end up happening i mean that's why when you turn on cnr msnbc it's hitler channel you're like
[3:11:04.500 --> 3:11:08.740]  what do you mean they're saying whites are bad hitler said whites were the best it's a dialectic
[3:11:10.660 --> 3:11:16.580]  they create the two sides clash them together i like the russian model where they know they've
[3:11:16.580 --> 3:11:19.940]  been attacked they know they brought in all these other groups to hate russians russians have been
[3:11:19.940 --> 3:11:24.260]  told to hate themselves not have kids all kill themselves russian suicides down russians for
[3:11:24.260 --> 3:11:29.060]  the first time in decades are living longer uh and they're having more kids and they're coming back
[3:11:29.060 --> 3:11:33.460]  not out of a racist thing that russians are best but that hey we're russians and we we like ourselves
[3:11:33.460 --> 3:11:38.020]  and we like who we are and we've survived a bunch of people trying to take us out for 500 years and
[3:11:38.020 --> 3:11:42.580]  we're not going to go down and we're proud of ourselves if you want to work with us if you're
[3:11:42.580 --> 3:11:46.180]  anybody the group that's great but you want to come in and tell us what to do we're going to throw
[3:11:46.180 --> 3:11:52.180]  your ass out and if you start to stop that we're going to kill you and that's what the polls are
[3:11:52.180 --> 3:11:56.660]  doing and that's what the hungarians and the romanians and the checks are doing because they've
[3:11:56.660 --> 3:12:01.860]  been invaded for 1400 years by muslims and they know it when they hear again that white people
[3:12:01.860 --> 3:12:06.580]  are bad you better let the muslims in to run your life they say you know what i can't go to a muslim
[3:12:06.580 --> 3:12:10.740]  country and say i'm gonna run the whole show i'm pulling my knife out and i'm fighting to the death
[3:12:10.740 --> 3:12:16.660]  and they're winning so i want identity for everybody i want everybody to have their culture
[3:12:16.660 --> 3:12:20.740]  and have their strength and build up the best parts of their cultures and have our cultures come
[3:12:20.740 --> 3:12:27.220]  together as we want to come together as individuals naturally not forced by big mega corporations
[3:12:27.220 --> 3:12:32.980]  that say the end of humanity is almost here and are about to have a giant global race war to bring
[3:12:32.980 --> 3:12:41.380]  us down it's the only way the damn robots can win and the blueprints for this satanic world
[3:12:41.380 --> 3:12:48.500]  government are right out of deep space baby it's all right there in ezekiel it's all right there
[3:12:48.500 --> 3:12:55.220]  in genesis it's all right there in revelations i mean you actually go read that stuff for yourself
[3:12:55.220 --> 3:12:59.140]  and then you're like you'll know what you're reading you're not tuning into art bell you're
[3:12:59.140 --> 3:13:11.140]  tuning into the bible and there is a fallen offworld group and he's got a big army and they
[3:13:11.140 --> 3:13:17.220]  operate like any army does from stealth it's like our military where's the night goggles and comes
[3:13:17.220 --> 3:13:21.860]  at night well they're they're right there folks they're right here with us every culture knows
[3:13:21.860 --> 3:13:28.180]  everybody understands it the globalists serve it and they are working with a really nasty group to
[3:13:28.180 --> 3:13:35.540]  take us down and i think we're smart enough to beat this and the only way you're gonna beat it
[3:13:35.540 --> 3:13:44.100]  is what we're doing here on this show but then you can't accept the leftist ideology and and
[3:13:44.100 --> 3:13:48.580]  if you've got white children you know tell them you'll just don't ever be proud of the fact you're
[3:13:48.580 --> 3:13:52.420]  white and lay down to people telling you you're you're bad no we're all being racially targeted
[3:13:52.420 --> 3:13:56.740]  and discriminated against as white people so we have to then stand up for ourselves and get
[3:13:56.740 --> 3:14:01.220]  past the peer pressure and say this is what you're doing shut the hell up i mean i'm not a big
[3:14:01.220 --> 3:14:04.900]  part of your but when i was getting divorced like five you know six years ago i would go to halloween
[3:14:04.900 --> 3:14:09.060]  parties and stuff and i would have women and other people walk over to me because i was famous
[3:14:10.100 --> 3:14:16.580]  and go are you a nazi because i was wearing a captain hat nothing like a nazi hat and now
[3:14:16.580 --> 3:14:20.500]  and i was you know a white guy and i'd say you know and they would say more about well you know
[3:14:20.500 --> 3:14:24.740]  there's all these nazis around and i'd say no you're the nazi you're a racist that comes from
[3:14:24.740 --> 3:14:29.540]  the most open country in the world you tell me i'm a racist and it was like Arab men doing it and
[3:14:29.540 --> 3:14:32.980]  leftist women i'll just laugh at them in the party and just get in their face and they would they
[3:14:32.980 --> 3:14:37.860]  would piss themselves because they were so sorry no i'm not a racist let me let me suck your boots
[3:14:37.860 --> 3:14:43.220]  that's not going to happen either now i'm going to go to gustof and johnny and marcos and alex
[3:14:43.220 --> 3:14:47.940]  and jason and jd then i'm going to air this un report but i'm going to go to your calls when we
[3:14:47.940 --> 3:14:55.620]  come back but you have to understand folks that i don't care what somebody thinks about me so i
[3:14:55.620 --> 3:14:59.940]  don't not go along with the whole racist ideology because i'm worried about political correctness
[3:14:59.940 --> 3:15:07.380]  coming at me that richard Spencer's on twitter he's on youtube i'm not because i'm trying to stop
[3:15:07.380 --> 3:15:12.820]  the anti-human takeover and notice they don't attack me when i say hey it's off-world entity
[3:15:12.820 --> 3:15:16.820]  manipulating humanity trying to teach us how to destroy ourselves notice that they don't
[3:15:16.820 --> 3:15:20.660]  make a thing out of that because they all follow that they all know that they're not atheist
[3:15:23.140 --> 3:15:26.660]  all these top levels go oh there's inner dimensions the word aliens are telling us that's what
[3:15:26.660 --> 3:15:32.580]  that's a freaking ufo cult out in san francisco and uh silicon valley they take huge doses of drugs
[3:15:32.580 --> 3:15:36.660]  build the interface with these entities that are giving them the blueprints of the ideas of all
[3:15:36.660 --> 3:15:41.620]  this crap to build and and then how to make us racially fight with each other to take us down
[3:15:41.620 --> 3:15:45.940]  let me explain it again interdimensional aliens are attacking us to make us all kill each other

[3:21:31.060 --> 3:21:34.980]  make sure we had money to bring down inventory massively so yeah we're going to be leaner
[3:21:34.980 --> 3:21:38.820]  and meaner now so there won't be those kind of specials at that level even though i say that
[3:21:38.820 --> 3:21:44.180]  super female vitality is 60 off right now super male sold out but i'm sorry go ahead sir and get
[3:21:44.180 --> 3:21:50.260]  into your point yes sir uh virginia i had a question wondering like what's the exact date
[3:21:50.260 --> 3:21:54.900]  like are they still like are caught on trying to get the guns and like what oh yeah oh yeah they
[3:21:54.900 --> 3:21:59.220]  said we'll call the military out we got bills we're going to confiscate the semi-auto we're
[3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:05.780]  going to shut down the gun ranges we're going to shut down all uh boxing jujitsu all self-defense
[3:22:05.780 --> 3:22:09.620]  classes i mean there's actual bills uh and they've got the votes and they and they say that they're
[3:22:09.620 --> 3:22:14.580]  just going to set up checkpoints and they want to start a fight uh because they know they can't
[3:22:14.580 --> 3:22:17.940]  win the general election they want to start a civil war so they're very serious about it i'm
[3:22:17.940 --> 3:22:22.740]  going to be going there and i'll be there uh next week wow yeah definitely i mean that's
[3:22:22.740 --> 3:22:26.420]  this kind of concerning thinking it could be a civil war this month you know i'm here out in
[3:22:26.420 --> 3:22:31.220]  round rock and it's just kind of concerning seeing you know i've been living in this area since 1998
[3:22:32.180 --> 3:22:37.300]  it's just you see the the leftist and you just see how this whole austin gray or metropolitan
[3:22:37.300 --> 3:22:44.740]  areas is really turned very blue and just imagine southern california as a giant toilet uh that's
[3:22:44.740 --> 3:22:49.300]  full and then there was a pipe going right to central texas and then they just flushed it and
[3:22:49.300 --> 3:22:53.700]  then that's what we've got here and i'm telling you it's not the illegal aliens that i don't like
[3:22:53.700 --> 3:23:00.740]  it's the it's the vampire leftist it makes me sick yes and there are a lot of good people coming
[3:23:00.740 --> 3:23:05.700]  from california too but they're like one out of five because they're coming to flee it no the others
[3:23:05.700 --> 3:23:11.140]  just know they destroyed it they're coming here to do the same thing to us yes sir yes sir well
[3:23:11.140 --> 3:23:16.340]  thank you for taking my call alex and god bless god bless you sir i appreciate your call it's it's
[3:23:16.340 --> 3:23:19.860]  really bad oh my gosh i didn't realize johnny was calling from denmark so i'm gonna go to johnny next
[3:23:19.860 --> 3:23:27.940]  in gustov uh johnny you're on the air welcome from denmark hello alex welcome thank you well
[3:23:27.940 --> 3:23:35.940]  i finally got through happy new year that new decade i call it the doubly roaring 2020 like
[3:23:35.940 --> 3:23:42.820]  you had the roaring 1920s doubly roaring 2020 yes sir this year is the doubly roaring 2020 i've been
[3:23:42.820 --> 3:23:49.540]  an avid listener for about 10 years um i actually a very avid listener for like i don't know six
[3:23:49.540 --> 3:23:56.980]  years and listening for between six and 14 hours a day wow cold winter days here in denmark i listen
[3:23:56.980 --> 3:24:00.340]  to all the shows and sometimes i listen twice because you know it's kind of in the background
[3:24:00.340 --> 3:24:08.020]  if i was totally focused i'd listen only once i understand um also um i'm uh i'm possibly i'm
[3:24:08.020 --> 3:24:12.260]  guessing that i am your best customer in Copenhagen and in denmark and maybe in our old scandinavia
[3:24:12.260 --> 3:24:18.980]  probably i did the stats today i spent uh about 19 000 dollars uh last year on it at money well
[3:24:18.980 --> 3:24:24.260]  spent um it's that tiny percentage of folks that underwrite this show so money well spent my friend
[3:24:24.260 --> 3:24:32.580]  god bless you are you still there johnny um yes i was going to make a suggestion along those lines
[3:24:32.580 --> 3:24:38.260]  um that you allow people like me to know see i'm speculating um based on what you're saying
[3:24:38.260 --> 3:24:44.500]  that only about two percent of the uh listeners buy from the shop and of those only a small
[3:24:44.500 --> 3:24:48.420]  percentage you buy a lot this might be an idea for your store this isn't the first of many
[3:24:48.420 --> 3:24:54.500]  suggestions but i have um to let people know where they stand ordinarily in terms of their city
[3:24:54.500 --> 3:24:58.900]  their country etc because you know if i knew that by spending another hundred dollars i'd go to
[3:24:58.900 --> 3:25:04.180]  number one and who knows what uh denmark or or scandinavia or europe i might do it other people
[3:25:04.180 --> 3:25:07.140]  might do the same although it's hard to get stuff into europe too and we've we've tried to think
[3:25:07.140 --> 3:25:10.420]  about setting up some city areas over there to get it shipped in but then if you manufacture it
[3:25:10.420 --> 3:25:14.660]  there you got to go through its rules and it's cost prohibitive that we never gotten big enough
[3:25:14.660 --> 3:25:18.100]  to scale up and do that but that that that was our goal that's why they're trying to shut us down
[3:25:18.100 --> 3:25:24.820]  before we uh do that but that's a great idea sir well if you'd like to um i'd be willing to help
[3:25:24.820 --> 3:25:29.220]  with that uh because i know a lot about the ins and outs here for example sweden has much more
[3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:35.540]  lenient policies in denmark for example i can no longer order uh apac power stack from the us
[3:25:35.540 --> 3:25:42.740]  because get this if i order it from europe like for example sweden i can bring in product products
[3:25:42.740 --> 3:25:49.460]  with melatonin if i order it from the us i can't however i believe sweden does not have that prohibition
[3:25:49.460 --> 3:25:56.020]  so if you had a uh a warehouse or or distributor in sweden and said that there it will be okay
[3:25:56.020 --> 3:25:59.540]  and that would get around the that would get around the denmark rules via the eu rule right
[3:26:00.660 --> 3:26:06.180]  right exactly well so so denmark is restricting and making uh melatonin a controlled substance
[3:26:07.300 --> 3:26:11.780]  correct they've already done that um well i guess you could take a whole bottle of it and hurt
[3:26:11.780 --> 3:26:15.140]  yourself that's like saying you can't have gasoline because you might burn yourself up with it it's
[3:26:15.140 --> 3:26:20.740]  just crazy well we know we know what's behind it what's behind it is you know you are costing the
[3:26:20.740 --> 3:26:26.260]  medical pharmaceutical industry literally trillions of dollars and and they're and that's why i tell
[3:26:26.260 --> 3:26:30.660]  people the four the four best um there's not just me it supplements in general i mean they've got
[3:26:30.660 --> 3:26:35.300]  all these double blind studies that good turmeric is way better than prozac prozac's bad for you but
[3:26:35.300 --> 3:26:39.540]  you know in studies to make you happy i mean it's not just an antioxidant it's not just for joints
[3:26:39.540 --> 3:26:43.460]  the anti-inflammatory and exactly you go through all this and that's why they're trying to patent
[3:26:43.460 --> 3:26:48.980]  fish oil and then not let everybody else sell fish oil well it's a damn food but but yeah i mean
[3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:54.020]  that it's what god gave us is the answer and when people get the pure good stuff it just makes their
[3:26:54.020 --> 3:26:59.220]  lives so much better oh absolutely i mean listen to my voice how well do i sound i'm actually 55
[3:26:59.220 --> 3:27:03.220]  years old going on 56 and the reason is because i've been taking very good care of my health
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:10.340]  throughout my life and i'm very good at discriminating high quality stuff and that's how i got attracted
[3:27:10.340 --> 3:27:15.380]  to info wars generally the information is high quality and the products are high quality also
[3:27:15.380 --> 3:27:19.140]  well thank you brother real quick i want to get your take on trump and iran give us your view on that
[3:27:20.340 --> 3:27:25.380]  yes um i and i'm glad you asked about that i was wondering because we hadn't talked about it
[3:27:25.380 --> 3:27:29.380]  for a while because it's called screener said i should lead with that but then i didn't hear
[3:27:29.380 --> 3:27:33.060]  about it for a while i'm happy to talk about that i just want to start with some background
[3:27:33.060 --> 3:27:41.220]  that i believe based on my you know extensive research over decades now of you know world
[3:27:41.220 --> 3:27:46.420]  history and psychology and all that um that trump is the greatest psychosocial political
[3:27:46.420 --> 3:27:52.100]  economical spiritual super genius ever and i and the thing about him is if there were a political
[3:27:52.100 --> 3:27:58.420]  iq test his would be about a 300 i mean and i've been saying now for years he has clearly studied
[3:27:58.420 --> 3:28:04.100]  markia valley he's clearly studied bizmark he's clearly studied sun sue and he's clearly studied
[3:28:04.100 --> 3:28:08.100]  claudia so i can get into any one of those but it's interesting in that sense that he tweeted
[3:28:08.100 --> 3:28:16.100]  just the other day uh quote from sun sue that the supreme art of war is subduing the enemy without
[3:28:16.100 --> 3:28:19.780]  fighting and i think hold on i want to hear you go through that briefly you're such a good caller
[3:28:19.780 --> 3:28:23.380]  we'll get to everybody else i promise everybody holding when we come back uh with johnny from
[3:28:23.380 --> 3:28:27.700]  denmark these are the amazing listeners we have and again we don't screen your calls as to what you
[3:28:27.700 --> 3:28:33.220]  can say i've just told john i'm like listen i'm glad they're plugging the products but we do that
[3:28:33.220 --> 3:28:37.700]  enough ourselves kind of tell them not what to say but just get to their topic we want to hear
[3:28:37.700 --> 3:28:41.460]  what they have to say about the topic and not so much about the products even though people can
[3:28:41.460 --> 3:28:46.420]  hear how good they are uh so yeah i guess i am starting to screen the calls like hey you don't
[3:28:46.420 --> 3:28:49.620]  have to tell me you love me you don't have to tell me how great the products are all the time just
[3:28:49.620 --> 3:28:54.820]  we want to hear what you think about politics we can all agree these are troubled times right
[3:28:54.820 --> 3:29:00.180]  so do you know who's on your wireless network whether it's a big company selling your data

[3:29:46.820 --> 3:29:57.220]  home network today with flash routers i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact
[3:29:57.220 --> 3:30:07.540]  that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[3:30:08.420 --> 3:30:15.460]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even
[3:30:15.460 --> 3:30:22.180]  attenuated they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly non-lethal same stuff they did
[3:30:22.180 --> 3:30:29.860]  with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so many this is just crazy and the congos
[3:30:29.860 --> 3:30:34.980]  had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few
[3:30:34.980 --> 3:30:40.980]  years oh and of course opening the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the democrats
[3:30:40.980 --> 3:30:47.460]  distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted
[3:30:47.460 --> 3:30:56.500]  ebola assault on america this is the new world order knock on wood i am not tempting fate but
[3:30:56.500 --> 3:31:02.580]  everybody around the office especially folks that have worked there a long time have noticed that i
[3:31:02.580 --> 3:31:07.940]  really don't ever get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow because i just made that statement
[3:31:07.940 --> 3:31:12.980]  i'm not tempting fate i'll say that again because i am superstitious when it comes down to that very
[3:31:12.980 --> 3:31:19.220]  thankful the good lord for the constitution i've been given but up until about eight nine years ago
[3:31:19.220 --> 3:31:27.220]  when i started taking x2 and the products in force life i i still got sick every couple years and
[3:31:27.220 --> 3:31:32.740]  you know i still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that but now that i
[3:31:32.740 --> 3:31:37.780]  religiously take the products and in force life one of the highest quality supplements you're gonna
[3:31:37.780 --> 3:31:46.420]  find out there i just never get a fever anymore it's probably been three four years since i've had
[3:31:46.420 --> 3:31:53.380]  a fever it's just crazy so i chalk it up to genetics and the great products hey you there
[3:31:54.340 --> 3:32:01.540]  we have a problem you see there is a baby the mother of this baby is not sure
[3:32:01.540 --> 3:32:08.980]  she's ready the father of this baby doesn't want to settle down the mother starts to have regrets
[3:32:09.620 --> 3:32:19.860]  the father considers leaving town but a friend says there's a solution she says to have an abortion
[3:32:20.820 --> 3:32:26.980]  the mother decides to look into it the clinic assures her it's safe she's made her decision
[3:32:26.980 --> 3:32:33.540]  she's going to have an abortion the problem is that baby is you
[3:32:36.500 --> 3:32:43.540]  join me oh and shroyer at the march for life friday january 24th in washington dc
[3:32:43.540 --> 3:32:49.940]  noon at the national mall i'll see you there it's time to stand up for the unborn it's time to speak
[3:32:49.940 --> 3:32:58.660]  out for the voiceless you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:58.660 --> 3:33:20.340]  you know what i really think about the world is what i say on air
[3:33:21.620 --> 3:33:27.300]  like i say things on air i never say in private this is like my secret place right in front of
[3:33:27.300 --> 3:33:33.060]  the whole world and that's what the establishment fears is somebody that just says what's on their
[3:33:33.060 --> 3:33:39.460]  heart just looks at the world through the eyes of a child and then i got a few other eyes to look
[3:33:39.460 --> 3:33:46.260]  at things but i always look at it the eyes of a child first speaking of trump there's a quote
[3:33:46.260 --> 3:33:51.940]  out there i always butcher him he said the deepest thing i ever learned how to do was to be shallow
[3:33:51.940 --> 3:33:59.220]  and you know that's because you're subconscious your mind your spirit all of it is hundreds of
[3:33:59.220 --> 3:34:03.620]  not thousands of times were powerful than your cerebral cortex and your limited focus
[3:34:04.900 --> 3:34:09.620]  and so it's the gut women's intuition whatever you want to call it that is almost always right
[3:34:10.740 --> 3:34:14.020]  now you can misinterpret what your gut's telling you and think it's something else
[3:34:14.980 --> 3:34:19.700]  when it's something else that's going on you know they say horses are psychic and that's
[3:34:19.700 --> 3:34:23.860]  been proven but they'll think it's this thing going on instead of that thing and women are
[3:34:23.860 --> 3:34:27.700]  particularly psychic and they'll think that that it's something you're doing instead of what
[3:34:27.700 --> 3:34:33.060]  something else is happening but we're all pretty much the same at the end of the day what's psychic
[3:34:33.060 --> 3:34:38.340]  it just means you've got senses and things that aren't just the five senses it's all been proven
[3:34:38.340 --> 3:34:45.460]  it's there again it's how hummingbirds can fly from canada uh to guatemala 5000 miles and land
[3:34:45.460 --> 3:34:52.420]  in the exact tree they were born in they're following a magnetic line whenever i'm making a
[3:34:52.420 --> 3:34:59.380]  creative choice i try to step back and remember my first shallow reaction the day i realized it can
[3:34:59.380 --> 3:35:05.060]  be smart to be shallow was for me a deep experience and the media made fun of that that's from his
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:13.060]  book think like a billionaire 2004 they go it's an oxymoron he said the deepness is being shallow
[3:35:13.060 --> 3:35:18.500]  but the real deepness is your intellect that instantly knows something so
[3:35:20.580 --> 3:35:24.900]  you know like you said you need to rake the forest that's technically the name they use in
[3:35:24.900 --> 3:35:28.980]  like a couple different countries in europe but that's the the average is called scrubbing the
[3:35:28.980 --> 3:35:34.420]  forest but again we're being removed from our normal environment and then taught that everything
[3:35:34.420 --> 3:35:41.060]  normal is alien uh so if trump is doing this 3d chess well i just can't wait then for them to do
[3:35:41.060 --> 3:35:46.260]  something about the censorship because big tech's spying on everybody they're lying about it
[3:35:46.980 --> 3:35:50.020]  they're doing all this incredibly illegal stuff and they're not doing anything
[3:35:51.380 --> 3:35:55.220]  at the white house level to stop this when it's it's bigger than just antitrust it's bigger than
[3:35:55.220 --> 3:36:02.180]  just free speech it's it's it's companies working to totally take over civilization and society and
[3:36:02.180 --> 3:36:12.180]  and maybe trump is 340 chess maybe he's bad then because he needs to do something now you know i
[3:36:12.180 --> 3:36:16.100]  probably won't get to the u.n report even though it's our top story i've covered it sunday i covered
[3:36:16.100 --> 3:36:20.100]  it friday i covered saturday it's so huge maybe i should just do the whole show tomorrow on it
[3:36:20.100 --> 3:36:24.740]  because you can't just you know go piecemeal on something this big the head you inside that says
[3:36:24.740 --> 3:36:31.060]  vaccines are killing people say that again vaccines are killing people and we've been covering it up
[3:36:31.060 --> 3:36:35.140]  and there's no accurate real testing and then she's on tv saying it's all safe and effective
[3:36:35.140 --> 3:36:39.140]  and we have all the other top scientists saying you don't want adjuvants and people are pissed
[3:36:39.140 --> 3:36:42.660]  and the doctors don't believe us anymore and they know the vaccines are hurting everybody
[3:36:42.660 --> 3:36:44.820]  this is it the top summit in switzerland
[3:36:49.060 --> 3:36:54.660]  and of course it's in the independent media and okay a few hundred thousand views on my website
[3:36:54.660 --> 3:37:01.060]  the bandah video this needs to be everywhere and the only way it gets out is you but see first it's
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:04.900]  sensor alec shones and now it's don't talk about vaccines don't even tell us what's on the insert
[3:37:05.620 --> 3:37:10.420]  wow that's stopping public health that's covering up for corrupt drug companies that facebook and
[3:37:10.420 --> 3:37:15.460]  google are invested in filthy criminals and now they want to make these vaccines mandatory
[3:37:17.460 --> 3:37:20.900]  the nazis just lines you up and shot you but see they know how to give you a shot kills you 10
[3:37:20.900 --> 3:37:25.380]  years later show violence is going to come out of this i don't want violence but if they keep
[3:37:25.380 --> 3:37:29.700]  trying to force vaccines and people get their kids hurt and they get hurt these vaccine heads
[3:37:29.700 --> 3:37:34.180]  and these corporate heads and then big tech heads are going to be fair game open season
[3:37:35.540 --> 3:37:40.580]  this is violence just like shooting black people up with live syphilis telling them it's a damn
[3:37:40.580 --> 3:37:46.580]  vaccine for 40 years the people that did that deserve to be hung by the neck until they died
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:52.740]  well they don't just shoot the poor black folks up these days they shoot everybody up with it
[3:37:52.740 --> 3:37:57.380]  and i don't give a rat's ass what color you are they better keep their damn hands off of us
[3:37:57.380 --> 3:38:02.340]  we've we're smart enough to know what this damn poison is now i'm going to go to jason and jady
[3:38:02.340 --> 3:38:06.740]  and marcus everybody so i got a real fast johnny from denmark get into trumps 3d chess and
[3:38:06.740 --> 3:38:10.820]  40 chess and this art of war stuff and then give me your take on the censorship it's only here
[3:38:10.820 --> 3:38:18.100]  what you have to say okay uh it's funny that you mentioned um that uh in the context of
[3:38:18.100 --> 3:38:23.060]  what you just mentioned like i can it's a good segue for me because just that quotation there
[3:38:23.060 --> 3:38:29.220]  political uh says oh that's what's a contradiction it was something like the day i realized uh i can
[3:38:29.220 --> 3:38:35.140]  be smart to be shallow was for me a deep revelation or something like that and what you mentioned uh
[3:38:35.140 --> 3:38:40.100]  it was like maybe a day he learned to tune into his instincts but like so many other things that he
[3:38:40.100 --> 3:38:46.260]  says and well do you respect like like a lot of biblical passages they all including in revelation
[3:38:46.260 --> 3:38:50.020]  as you mentioned before it has several meanings there's another one remember i mentioned claudius
[3:38:50.020 --> 3:38:54.500]  and how i thought that uh trump had studied him carefully yes the main message for me from
[3:38:54.500 --> 3:39:03.380]  roman emperor claudius was that it's more important to be smart than to look smart and and more
[3:39:03.380 --> 3:39:10.740]  and more over sometimes part of being as smart as possible is not looking too smart yeah and he
[3:39:10.740 --> 3:39:17.860]  does that too and um and uh and there's another censor and a two um third sense and which ties
[3:39:17.860 --> 3:39:24.100]  in with info wars also interestingly enough because as an avid info wars listener uh for
[3:39:24.100 --> 3:39:28.980]  decade now uh i realized there was enough out there if everyone were as avid as me and listening in
[3:39:28.980 --> 3:39:35.060]  2016 or remember the wiki leaks of waltz southern revelations there's enough material there to put
[3:39:35.060 --> 3:39:42.180]  a lot of them away our worst if you know what i'm saying um however it was information overload
[3:39:42.180 --> 3:39:50.340]  and part of his 4d 5d or whatever if you want to say genius is being able to give people digestible
[3:39:50.340 --> 3:39:55.300]  bites of information they're a part of the multifaceted intelligence is being able to not dumb
[3:39:55.300 --> 3:40:02.340]  it down but put out complex thoughts and systems and simply understood rosetta stone systems that
[3:40:02.340 --> 3:40:07.460]  open up larger horizons we get his name and number we should get uh this gentleman on as a routine
[3:40:07.460 --> 3:40:12.820]  guest uh when i'm going to start that new podcast soon with the callers okay thank you sir uh let's
[3:40:12.820 --> 3:40:18.500]  go ahead now thank you uh let's go ahead and talk to gustav in texas thanks for holding her on the
[3:40:18.500 --> 3:40:27.620]  here hey don't miss jones good brother thank you for holding hey um just uh real quick i just want
[3:40:27.620 --> 3:40:32.420]  to you know say that we really appreciate you here in the hometown of course that you left
[3:40:32.420 --> 3:40:38.580]  the best for last seeing from houston um real quick on the uh i hold the whole iran situation
[3:40:38.580 --> 3:40:44.420]  and everything um i kind of think things are being played uh kind of double sided by the
[3:40:44.420 --> 3:40:51.460]  president of iran um we have to think back all the way to the uh to the iran contra and what they
[3:40:51.460 --> 3:40:58.100]  did with the whole bill and you know the whole drug stuff that they were doing um i think now
[3:40:58.100 --> 3:41:07.300]  coming to 2020 um he has a clear idea of who our new leader is and the game that he is not playing
[3:41:07.300 --> 3:41:14.820]  with us or with them i should say and that um he is letting them know that the globalist he would be
[3:41:14.820 --> 3:41:19.940]  the um the establishment that he's saying meet the new boss and it ain't the same as the old boss
[3:41:21.380 --> 3:41:26.740]  right right right right that's exactly what he said that's exactly what he said yeah and and i and i
[3:41:26.740 --> 3:41:34.900]  and i think um as well as the establishment i feel as if he didn't take it serious he didn't he didn't
[3:41:34.900 --> 3:41:41.700]  take it he didn't he didn't take the the the win that we had got over the establishment in the
[3:41:41.700 --> 3:41:47.220]  elections he didn't take that as serious as when the first bomb strike down on his top general
[3:41:47.220 --> 3:41:54.740]  that's when he knew he said okay i either turn my back toward them or maybe some of that gravity
[3:41:55.700 --> 3:42:01.380]  can uh happen to me in my country because like you said uh the annihilation could happen within
[3:42:01.380 --> 3:42:06.260]  a second you know we have drones flying over this 247 the past i don't know maybe seven eight years
[3:42:06.260 --> 3:42:11.940]  because uh everything has started so you know i i think he comes to the realization that maybe
[3:42:11.940 --> 3:42:17.060]  trump is not somebody who we should be playing with right now i think that's beautifully said i just
[3:42:17.060 --> 3:42:20.740]  hope the neo cons and others don't try to set trump up with foreign stuff because they could
[3:42:20.740 --> 3:42:24.820]  really i think it kennedy with the bay of pigs and other events they could really sabotage operations
[3:42:24.820 --> 3:42:33.220]  right right right because like um to say that there isn't any mold or to say that there isn't
[3:42:33.220 --> 3:42:39.780]  anybody that's in there spying on him you know um well exactly that's why he said uh i couldn't tell
[3:42:39.780 --> 3:42:43.860]  you in congress because they don't link to thank you so much i really appreciate you holding sir

[3:44:54.340 --> 3:45:01.140]  to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody is well aware of the
[3:45:01.140 --> 3:45:08.100]  fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get
[3:45:08.100 --> 3:45:16.340]  it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still by concentration camp victims
[3:45:16.980 --> 3:45:22.820]  they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it doesn't matter
[3:45:22.820 --> 3:45:28.420]  that studies mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when you take the flu vaccine
[3:45:28.420 --> 3:45:34.100]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity it goes on
[3:45:34.100 --> 3:45:39.620]  and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the
[3:45:39.620 --> 3:45:46.820]  flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you problem of hoax you keep the giant hoax
[3:45:46.820 --> 3:45:53.060]  going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now i want to
[3:45:53.060 --> 3:45:57.540]  talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last
[3:45:57.540 --> 3:46:02.420]  week and a half and i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like
[3:46:02.420 --> 3:46:05.460]  well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell
[3:46:05.460 --> 3:46:11.940]  people and so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best
[3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:16.980]  toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste
[3:46:16.980 --> 3:46:22.020]  and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[3:46:22.020 --> 3:46:27.300]  because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even
[3:46:27.300 --> 3:46:33.140]  like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[3:46:33.140 --> 3:46:39.620]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four
[3:46:39.620 --> 3:46:43.620]  times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[3:46:43.620 --> 3:46:58.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:14.340 --> 3:47:18.180]  and i want more of it and i'm gonna get more of it
[3:47:19.220 --> 3:47:23.460]  stronger we fight for humanity the more we come together for a pro human future
[3:47:24.420 --> 3:47:29.780]  stronger we are and the closer to god we are it's not gonna be richard spencer and all the
[3:47:30.660 --> 3:47:33.540]  white people for the white people and the black people for the black people that make me don't
[3:47:33.540 --> 3:47:39.620]  all stand up for ourselves but it's realizing the ai world government takeover that is against
[3:47:39.620 --> 3:47:47.780]  every child and those little unborn babies who bleed red blood and we're part of our species
[3:47:47.780 --> 3:47:52.980]  are being killed by the millions and they're all different colors they haven't even had a chance to
[3:47:52.980 --> 3:47:57.380]  live yet outside their mother's wounds and we're letting them die we're treating them like trash
[3:47:58.660 --> 3:48:06.260]  and we're telling ourselves we're trash no i'm not trash and i'm not gonna sit there
[3:48:06.260 --> 3:48:11.940]  and play into this dialectic you've cracked the code jesus cracked the code

[3:48:17.220 --> 3:48:19.700]  kevin and arizona you're on the air welcome sir thanks for holding
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:26.420]  hey what's up alex kevin here proud black american uh i started listening to you
[3:48:26.420 --> 3:48:32.100]  2012 i was at amazon for about six years don't know what's going on but i started connecting
[3:48:32.100 --> 3:48:38.020]  dots took a break and now i'm back info warrior hardcore already ready to go been spreading the
[3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:44.980]  word non-stop uh bezos he recommended a book behold a pale white horse um that's sort of
[3:48:44.980 --> 3:48:50.420]  still if you for me i know you went to build a bird but uh you know overall man i'm just i'm
[3:48:50.420 --> 3:48:55.780]  just pumped up glad to be an american i'm tired of my own family disrespecting the constitution
[3:48:55.780 --> 3:49:01.700]  when we still sit here and say oh mouth will mix mouth will mix well mouth will mix himself uh respect
[3:49:01.700 --> 3:49:07.380]  to constitution and well he woke up later i mean he was always sophisticated had a lot of courage
[3:49:07.380 --> 3:49:11.780]  and was put under a lot of pressures that's why he first had to stand up for himself before he
[3:49:11.780 --> 3:49:15.460]  could stand up for everybody and i get that because when you're in a racially attacked thing the
[3:49:15.460 --> 3:49:19.460]  first thing you do stand up for yourself but then he transcended it traveling around the world
[3:49:19.460 --> 3:49:23.620]  and saw the larger division and as soon as he agreed with martin looser king he was dead boom
[3:49:23.620 --> 3:49:32.020]  exactly exactly and uh yeah i'm just standing up man i just just uh going to thank everybody
[3:49:32.020 --> 3:49:37.460]  over there and um you know i'm saying my aunt recently passed away and we found out it was
[3:49:37.460 --> 3:49:42.500]  a vaccine actually that killed her wow so when you when you're speaking about these vaccines
[3:49:42.500 --> 3:49:47.460]  i know firsthand was going on i stopped taking it two years ago just in fear and let's talk about
[3:49:47.460 --> 3:49:52.660]  that what i mean even they even admitted the reaction killed her yeah they admitted it yeah
[3:49:52.660 --> 3:49:56.820]  they it was the vaccine i don't i don't know exactly what chemical it was that was in it but
[3:49:56.820 --> 3:50:00.820]  they it was the vaccine she had recently got that give me a favor i'm gonna get your name
[3:50:00.820 --> 3:50:05.060]  a number guys don't let me forget to do this we're gonna hold vaccine show soon follow up on that call
[3:50:05.060 --> 3:50:10.500]  family and and you get all the facts on it we'd love to you know humanize your aunt because
[3:50:10.500 --> 3:50:16.020]  this is what's going on and it's everywhere and now have you seen the video where the human admits it
[3:50:17.060 --> 3:50:22.100]  yes sir yes please please for the next woman or man of every notice they're get they're targeting
[3:50:22.100 --> 3:50:27.620]  everybody with these shots folks and the doctors the human admits are waking up so they're not part
[3:50:27.620 --> 3:50:33.460]  of it they're being lied to too and so we need to warn everybody my friend and so god bless you all
[3:50:33.460 --> 3:50:37.860]  right you get his name a number and then and then or give him our hotline and when soon as he gets
[3:50:37.860 --> 3:50:42.740]  that info we have to like treat these people like humans i don't care what color you are you get killed
[3:50:42.740 --> 3:50:46.980]  by a vaccine we got to talk about it they've got to the point where these people die and we just it's
[3:50:46.980 --> 3:50:53.380]  hardly even an issue and again they can make clean vaccines that still have side effects but aren't
[3:50:53.380 --> 3:50:58.820]  as bad they're doing it on purpose and it's big pharma the un doesn't even test it they don't even
[3:50:58.820 --> 3:51:08.740]  know pisses me off anyways thank you uh kevin jd in texas shirt on the air go ahead jd oh good
[3:51:08.740 --> 3:51:15.460]  afternoon uh jones hey uh i've been uh been listening about the iran stuff and the airplane
[3:51:15.460 --> 3:51:21.700]  it's kind of funny how these guys uh avoided the question the whole time they bought you know
[3:51:21.700 --> 3:51:26.740]  they bought in the bulldozer to clear the clear off the uh the crash site oh yeah and by the way on
[3:51:26.740 --> 3:51:31.540]  friday on thursday i'm like look bulldozers are covering it up they're like shut up neocon warm
[3:51:31.540 --> 3:51:36.420]  hunger i'm just like it's a war zone the tour missiles they shot it down of course now they admit
[3:51:36.420 --> 3:51:43.060]  it right so why did they wait so long to finally admit it my question is this sir is who was on that
[3:51:43.060 --> 3:51:51.620]  airplane it was a bunch of olympic it was a bunch of olympic athletes and you know because that i mean
[3:51:51.620 --> 3:51:56.740]  i'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist but you know all these times airplanes get shot down
[3:51:56.740 --> 3:52:05.060]  like the one that just disappeared like in and 14 or 15 that came out of malaysia gone who was who's
[3:52:05.060 --> 3:52:09.140]  on those airplanes that were important to investigations the same us well you're not
[3:52:09.140 --> 3:52:14.580]  being conspiratorial we know that israel blows up a lot of iranian aircraft with iranian generals
[3:52:14.580 --> 3:52:18.180]  like they stopped flying a whole bunch of them at once on those because they'll because they put
[3:52:18.180 --> 3:52:24.180]  bombs on board and a bunch of other governments do it as well i believe the globalist nato shot
[3:52:24.180 --> 3:52:29.060]  down that malaysian airplane to try to embarrass the russians that didn't that the russians had no
[3:52:29.060 --> 3:52:33.220]  reason to shoot down that there wasn't any in a bombing zone and i'm not just defending the russians
[3:52:33.220 --> 3:52:39.060]  i just go with my own research and we were right they shot it down tour missiles and there you go
[3:52:39.700 --> 3:52:44.820]  it's just some odd stuff man also real quick sir you know how we're coming here we're ending
[3:52:44.820 --> 3:52:49.780]  this decade right now you know next year will be the new new decade coming up yes sir okay you
[3:52:49.780 --> 3:52:54.980]  know how history repeats itself think about the war we just got out of for almost 20 years we've
[3:52:54.980 --> 3:53:00.500]  been fighting over in afghanistan and iraq and iran poxie wars and everything else middle east all
[3:53:00.500 --> 3:53:07.620]  the hotspots now we're coming into the to the 20s it's come almost resident residents to the
[3:53:07.620 --> 3:53:12.980]  roaring 20s of 1920s listen i agree i was sitting here earlier thinking i need to get
[3:53:12.980 --> 3:53:16.980]  storable food not because i'm selling it already i mean i need to get a place in the country i need
[3:53:16.980 --> 3:53:21.940]  to get ready for collapse because if trump doesn't completely succeed he may stay in office but if
[3:53:21.940 --> 3:53:26.340]  he doesn't totally succeed uh in and quite frankly pumping the bubble up even better which is almost
[3:53:26.340 --> 3:53:30.580]  an impossible job we're gonna have an explosive depression i don't think any of us should lie
[3:53:30.580 --> 3:53:35.780]  about that to ourselves yeah i'm thinking the same thing you're feeling and aren't you absolutely
[3:53:35.780 --> 3:53:40.900]  god bless you jd yeah what goes up must come down and it's so overextended it's the big mega banks
[3:53:40.900 --> 3:53:46.180]  that did it and i don't want it to happen it's like it's like having a shoulder out of socket
[3:53:46.180 --> 3:53:49.620]  and they're about to pop that sucker back in you're like man i want this fixed but i don't want to
[3:53:49.620 --> 3:53:54.820]  feel it it's gonna hurt like hell uh jason in california you're on the air thanks for holding
[3:53:54.820 --> 3:54:01.380]  go ahead hey man i just wanted to comment on the iran thing real quick yes i haven't really heard
[3:54:01.380 --> 3:54:07.540]  i haven't heard much people talk about it today but i mean this is the reason why we need strong
[3:54:07.540 --> 3:54:14.420]  borders i mean you know his baller is known to be all over latin america and people just want to
[3:54:14.420 --> 3:54:19.700]  ignore this problem but this this i think this whole iran thing is really you know people should
[3:54:19.700 --> 3:54:25.300]  be talking about the like the need for a stronger border because of things like this because i mean
[3:54:25.300 --> 3:54:29.540]  do you see this really scary looking guy they caught with the 22 000 and all the weapons outside
[3:54:29.540 --> 3:54:36.100]  marlago yeah i did and you know that that's the thing with iran if it's just a straight one-on-one
[3:54:36.100 --> 3:54:41.540]  war with us they have no chance but people fail to realize their sleeper cells all over america
[3:54:41.540 --> 3:54:47.380]  because of the lapsed security on the border we have and it's guys like that is the reason we need
[3:54:47.380 --> 3:54:53.780]  guns yeah absolutely but you know the democrats want to take guns away from law-abiding citizens
[3:54:53.780 --> 3:54:58.900]  and without realizing there's more guns in this country than people so bad people are going to get
[3:54:58.900 --> 3:55:04.100]  guns regardless um but i just hope people start talking about border security more in the sense
[3:55:04.100 --> 3:55:10.420]  that it's not just immigration that we're trying to control it's bad people coming in here to
[3:55:10.420 --> 3:55:14.900]  destroy america from within you're absolutely right thank you for the call i'll just say i
[3:55:14.900 --> 3:55:20.340]  have we should control the border because of that but mainly because of fentanyl one grain of pure
[3:55:20.340 --> 3:55:24.900]  fentanyl will kill you and they're lacing everything with it and i just everybody i know as people dying
[3:55:24.900 --> 3:55:29.780]  or almost die from it i am so pissed i'm gonna say this anybody in my family gets hurt by fentanyl
[3:55:29.780 --> 3:55:34.900]  i'm i'm i'm holding the democrats responsible and the chai comms okay that's a violence attacking
[3:55:34.900 --> 3:55:40.180]  me and my family and i am pissed and they are there they're it's horrible and and thank god
[3:55:40.180 --> 3:55:44.820]  trump's trying to stop it and thank god uh that law enforcement understands they're sitting like
[3:55:44.820 --> 3:55:48.580]  cocaine or something where they let some of it slip through or whatever anybody with fentanyl
[3:55:48.580 --> 3:55:53.780]  selling it needs to be executed do like china does or singapore kill people that sell it i want
[3:55:53.780 --> 3:56:00.260]  them dead because it's two millions are getting killed by this crap and it's pissing me off excuse me
