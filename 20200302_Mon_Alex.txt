[00:00.000 --> 00:16.880]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.040]  Josh isn't the Fed cutting rates now just going to make the next economic downturn
[00:42.040 --> 00:46.620]  worse what's your prediction I've been hoping for a recession people hate me
[00:46.620 --> 00:49.960]  for it but it would get rid of Trump so you shouldn't hate me for it I mean
[00:49.960 --> 00:53.400]  recessions are really bad people lose their jobs and I know and we shouldn't
[00:53.400 --> 00:57.720]  wish it's worth it but I don't I mean a recession is always possible I don't see
[00:57.720 --> 01:00.760]  any particular reason to think that it's likely I think you know aren't we
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.440]  overdue for one just know this by the cycle of economic this is such a
[01:04.440 --> 01:07.200]  misconception people sort of feel like oh you know well about every eight years
[01:07.200 --> 01:09.360]  or something you're supposed to have it was recessions don't come because
[01:09.360 --> 01:11.880]  they're due recessions come because there's some sort of overheating
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.240]  something goes wrong in the economy like sacks yes Paul has Bernie losing to
[01:16.240 --> 01:21.000]  Trump but bet closer than all the other Democrats 47 to 15 nationally he beats
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.680]  him in Pennsylvania by four look all these pundits who I hear say things like
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.520]  well Bernie will lose 45 states shut up you don't know what we never know we
[01:32.520 --> 01:35.520]  never know you're the same people who said Trump wouldn't even get the
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.240]  nomination you don't know what's gonna what we don't know is Bernie needs a
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.040]  revolution to show up he needs people who have never voted before now they are
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.240]  not showing up in those numbers in the primary but we don't know but now since
[01:48.240 --> 01:54.080]  Trump I think is not gonna leave anyway might as well run Bernie he's not he's
[01:54.080 --> 01:57.680]  not and by the way when the virus gets bad he's gonna declare a martial law
[01:57.680 --> 02:02.040]  watch that oh my god that could happen but I could totally have your point
[02:02.040 --> 02:12.960]  about it is Monday March 2nd 2020 I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm an
[02:12.960 --> 02:18.320]  original person I have a thousand ways I could open each broadcast but more and
[02:18.320 --> 02:23.640]  more over the years I say the news is just insanely frantic right now and we've
[02:23.640 --> 02:29.080]  never had beggar news well we've never had beggar news because things just keep
[02:29.080 --> 02:34.120]  topping themselves 2020 has been an out-of-control year Kim Jong-un just
[02:34.120 --> 02:42.160]  fired missiles right over Japan breaking his deal with Trump we've got Turkey
[02:42.160 --> 02:48.800]  invading southern Europe the Balkans and of course it's not being called that by
[02:48.800 --> 02:52.880]  MSM they're calling it refugees but they're people using children as human
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.080]  shields to viciously pour across and attack police we have a reporter from
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.240]  Europe joining us we have the most insane footage coming up next segment and
[03:02.240 --> 03:07.560]  then we've got and then we've got and then we've got it just never ends that
[03:07.560 --> 03:12.200]  Joe Biden can rig this election for himself even though he's degenerating
[03:12.200 --> 03:18.480]  very very quickly and pretty soon will be the equivalent of a bag lady in the way
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.080]  he talks and behaves but they don't care they're just gonna force feed him and
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.040]  then you've got all the Bernie Sanders violence against people that come out
[03:27.040 --> 03:31.080]  and protest even Bernie Sanders security beat up a guy with a Trump flag that's
[03:31.080 --> 03:35.680]  coming up and the media defended that what a dangerous group of thugs it's
[03:35.680 --> 03:43.400]  just insane and then I've got news on the coronavirus that is the biggest yet
[03:43.400 --> 03:54.060]  and it's so big that I wanted to make some phone calls to some other sources
[03:54.060 --> 04:00.680]  in the army and I wanted to create some graphs this morning before I put this
[04:00.680 --> 04:05.880]  out and so the graphs being made right now probably already done but at the
[04:05.880 --> 04:15.240]  bottom of the hour I am going to get into this information that makes me
[04:15.240 --> 04:22.640]  sweat really does and I want to be very careful how I bring this information out
[04:22.640 --> 04:28.240]  I understand what the president's doing playing this down but I can tell you what
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.440]  the Pentagon is telling officers from the four-star general level down to
[04:33.440 --> 04:39.800]  lieutenant colonels and they they're looking for three million dead in the
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.760]  United States they're not saying it's gonna happen but that's currently what
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.440]  is believed is gonna happen and the question is can they quietly cover it
[04:48.440 --> 04:52.720]  up or do they go ahead and tell the public creating a bigger panic or is
[04:52.720 --> 04:57.640]  that estimate wrong it's all coming up today

[06:32.560 --> 06:38.680]  well this is up to this date the most out of control most important most
[06:38.680 --> 06:43.360]  critical broadcast I've ever done and I've told you this many times it's the
[06:43.360 --> 06:50.920]  truth I've been on there 26 years and 20 years ago I start saying on air wow
[06:50.920 --> 06:54.760]  this is the biggest news we've ever reported I maybe would do that once
[06:54.760 --> 06:58.360]  every couple years and then it would become once every year or so and then
[06:58.360 --> 07:03.640]  about five six years ago I'd start saying it every few months and now here
[07:03.640 --> 07:12.720]  we are this is the biggest most insane news I have ever reported on air and the
[07:12.720 --> 07:17.160]  way the public has been made ignorant about history and the way the corporate
[07:17.160 --> 07:23.040]  control globalist decepticon media can repackage insane things like they're no
[07:23.040 --> 07:30.600]  big deal is just unbelievable and so let me just tell you the news that's coming
[07:30.600 --> 07:42.680]  up for today bottom of the hour I have talked to multiple experts one of them
[07:42.680 --> 07:51.280]  a lieutenant colonel with army special operations who said the Pentagon
[07:51.280 --> 07:58.040]  believes with the numbers they have that they could have up to 3 million dead
[07:58.040 --> 08:03.400]  people in the next six months here in the United States from the Coronavirus now
[08:03.400 --> 08:12.760]  I learned this a couple days ago and then there was a retired lieutenant colonel
[08:12.760 --> 08:23.440]  in my house this morning and I had to go on a totally separate issue and my
[08:23.440 --> 08:28.520]  wife's in there drinking coffee with him he just retired like a year ago and he
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.560]  goes yeah the word and he was with army special operations just so happens and
[08:32.560 --> 08:37.920]  he says yeah the word is from the numbers is they're looking at 3 million
[08:37.920 --> 08:46.920]  dead now I was driving into work at 8 this morning when she called and told
[08:46.920 --> 08:52.520]  me that I almost ran off the road because I was already gonna report what I
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.920]  was told this weekend by a current lieutenant colonel connected to secret
[08:57.920 --> 09:03.760]  operations around the world even at that who I talked to and this other
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.800]  individual just happened to be coming by the house on a business matter known
[09:08.800 --> 09:15.200]  this guy a wild nice fella and he was telling my wife this and she was saying
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.240]  hey I don't know if I want to go on that big trip overseas with you to interview
[09:20.240 --> 09:23.920]  that world leader but we're lining up I'm gonna tell you who till we do it she
[09:23.920 --> 09:32.600]  said there's a coronavirus show that's the type of stuff going on you talk
[09:32.600 --> 09:39.200]  about synchronicity you talk about serendipity sometimes it's really
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.720]  serious things sometimes it's really ridiculous things this morning I had to
[09:43.720 --> 09:47.080]  go to the bank after I've been at the office a few hours I was coming back
[09:47.080 --> 09:51.840]  here and I said you know I want to double water burger cheeseburger is my
[09:51.840 --> 09:57.120]  breakfast I'm gonna be bad today I might eat one of those every month and I was
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.120]  riding up there with our office manager he goes you know I could tell your
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.360]  stressed out today I already called ahead and as we pull into the office
[10:04.360 --> 10:09.480]  Pat Riley's waiting at the office door with the double cheeseburger
[10:09.480 --> 10:21.320]  synchronicity serendipity what do you call that when intuition or just knowing
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.840]  how I am but I mean my mind eat one every two months but the point is you're
[10:26.840 --> 10:29.240]  like Alex why the hell are you talking about cheeseburgers here on there
[10:29.240 --> 10:34.000]  because I don't know what to do at this point because that's a true story I just
[10:34.000 --> 10:42.160]  told you about two one retired one currently serving in a specific sensitive
[10:42.160 --> 10:47.840]  area of the military not told to tell me this just telling me this and if
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.880]  that's like God saying you need to talk about that so obviously I am at the
[10:53.880 --> 11:00.320]  bottom of the hour the Democrat field is absolutely insane and it's just
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.200]  degenerating and it's emblematic of their mental illness and their corruption
[11:11.960 --> 11:18.800]  and then all the rest of this is just it's just insane so when we start the
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.360]  next segment because something like this you can't get into the middle of a
[11:22.360 --> 11:30.760]  segment start talking about it it's it's so historic it's so big it's so important
[11:30.760 --> 11:36.480]  it's so naked it's so obvious and to see the enemy media lying to people about
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.840]  what it is and to have the Islamists is caught red-handed torturing their
[11:42.840 --> 11:50.640]  children and babies so they're screaming and wailing for photo ops as they try to
[11:50.640 --> 11:57.120]  physically assault and overrun the Greek border is shades of the poor little
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.680]  kid that had drowned somehow and then the folks got caught staging his body
[12:01.680 --> 12:08.040]  being found for the cameras remember coming across from Libya into Italy so
[12:08.040 --> 12:16.680]  here's what's happening the dictator of Turkey Erdogan gave the EU a list of
[12:16.680 --> 12:24.120]  man's a few years ago and he said I'm gonna release three to five million
[12:24.120 --> 12:30.760]  people into your country out of Syria and now the rest of the Middle East most
[12:30.760 --> 12:37.440]  of military men if you do not let me set up Turkish parties and all your
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.880]  governments which can then with only five six seven percent of the vote take
[12:41.880 --> 12:49.920]  over a government with alliances with other parliament groups and he's now
[12:49.920 --> 12:56.120]  begun the invasion so Islam popped up 1400 years ago it's been invading Europe
[12:56.120 --> 13:02.240]  for 1300 years the Crusades were a response after hundreds and hundreds of
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.320]  years held more than that like 800 years of the Islamists pushing all the way
[13:08.320 --> 13:16.480]  into Western Europe and so this is an invasion that that Erdogan says is an
[13:16.480 --> 13:22.600]  invasion and you turn on CNN you turn on MSNBC and they're saying these are
[13:22.600 --> 13:29.080]  poor wonderful refugees in the UN saying let them all in so that is the UN
[13:29.080 --> 13:34.160]  openly working with Islam to invade the West and it's just outrageous and
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.000]  criminal and the same UN has said that we should open our borders up to people
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.760]  from China with the coronavirus but the China is good when they shoot their own
[13:46.760 --> 13:52.920]  people at checkpoints so this is 21st century warfare and you can look at the
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.520]  globalist using coronavirus to hurt the economy the hordes of migrants and
[13:58.520 --> 14:02.280]  invaders that they've hopped up and ready to invade led by NGOs with
[14:02.280 --> 14:06.720]  propaganda cores and you look at the cultural attack on our children and our
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.200]  morals this is a full-out attack this is a world war and we need to know who the
[14:12.200 --> 14:16.160]  players are and who the sides are and what the goals are of the players and
[14:16.160 --> 14:23.040]  Trump's begun to put that out needs to be very specific this separately you
[14:23.040 --> 14:26.040]  notice we told you four weeks ago there will be runs on store shelves all over
[14:26.040 --> 14:29.760]  the world on food within a few months we predicted looking at viral spread and
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.360]  saying that they're clearly covering up the fact of spreading here in the
[14:32.360 --> 14:37.080]  United States that will cause panic later irrespective of how deadly the
[14:37.080 --> 14:45.040]  virus is regardless and now exactly as we said is now unfolding precisely so
[14:45.040 --> 14:48.240]  all the other big swarable food companies have been sold out for a month
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.120]  they lie to you and take your orders and say seven to ten days it's six to eight
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.240]  weeks really it's like five to four to five weeks but some things might take
[14:56.240 --> 15:00.160]  longer so we're saying that to be safe but we actually have it and it's high
[15:00.160 --> 15:06.080]  quality and the way this virus is gonna peak is in the middle of the summer so
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.280]  right now you're just seeing some hysteria but the real problems if it
[15:09.280 --> 15:13.400]  is super deadly are gonna be in months so you'll get your food we're talking
[15:13.400 --> 15:21.320]  three four months but the real thing you do is boost your immunity and bodies

[17:24.440 --> 17:28.360]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than
[17:28.360 --> 17:31.640]  move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that

[20:01.600 --> 20:07.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:07.120 --> 20:36.520]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen so Turkey's dictator Erdogan
[20:36.520 --> 20:43.360]  has told Europe that if you don't do exactly what I say politically and if
[20:43.360 --> 20:48.560]  you don't let millions more immigrant invaders in from the Middle East I'll
[20:48.560 --> 20:52.400]  just release three to five million a year that I allowed to come into Turkey
[20:52.400 --> 20:56.960]  and then to invade into your nation he's on record saying it it's in the
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.320]  Turkish news it's buried in our newspapers but if you turn on CNN or MSNBC
[21:02.320 --> 21:06.280]  you'd think that the Greeks and others are a bunch of demons attacking men
[21:06.280 --> 21:11.200]  women and children because the Islamist almost 90% of military aged men are
[21:11.200 --> 21:16.160]  using babies as human shields hell why not they use them a suicide bomb
[21:16.160 --> 21:21.160]  suicide bombers they'll even bring a baby and strapped with it as well this is
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.120]  a cover story and then blow themselves up and that just gives you an idea of how
[21:26.120 --> 21:32.680]  the 1300 year old invasion of Islam into Europe never stopped and their goal
[21:32.680 --> 21:37.840]  their plan never stopped Turkey was once the Eastern Empire of the Holy Roman
[21:37.840 --> 21:43.160]  Empire after Rome fell in 410 the Visigoth chiefs in Alaric the Byzantine
[21:43.160 --> 21:50.920]  Empire was still the Holy Roman Empire but it fell later to the Muslims
[21:50.920 --> 21:58.080]  Constantinople became Istanbul and we're gonna show you a report Gregory's put
[21:58.080 --> 22:04.960]  together that shows the invaders putting babies over fires and smoke to burn
[22:04.960 --> 22:09.600]  their eyes to make them cry before they run up and try to cross the police lines
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.120]  and people screaming in babies faces to do it and our own media is trying to make
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.800]  excuses and cover it up we're also gonna show you migrants shot the death by
[22:19.800 --> 22:24.840]  Greek police as border clashes grow the Greeks are absolutely revolting at this
[22:24.840 --> 22:32.240]  the Greeks were held by the Turks in the last century up until World War 2 the
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.480]  Greeks are sick of it they've been fending off the Muslims for a thousand
[22:36.480 --> 22:43.600]  years and been taken over a few times and Greeks had to live in the hills to not
[22:43.600 --> 22:47.840]  be raped and again just an example of the raping Greeks were once all
[22:47.840 --> 22:52.440]  blonde-haired blue-eyed look Germanic most Greeks aren't now because they were
[22:52.440 --> 22:58.600]  raped ladies and gentlemen so again Turkey sends 18,000 migrants as
[22:58.600 --> 23:04.440]  Greece deploys army helicopters naval warships national file.com fire rises
[23:04.440 --> 23:09.000]  Greek revolt against migrant centers government uses military to repel
[23:09.000 --> 23:16.520]  migrant invasion it's total war and Erdogan says it's an invasion but our
[23:16.520 --> 23:24.740]  enemy media won't even tell us what's going on the footage is incredible on
[23:24.740 --> 23:28.200]  inforwars.com it's a powder keg ready to explode in Greek Village 10th to the
[23:28.200 --> 23:32.120]  December between refugees and locals Turkish president Erdogan vows to keep
[23:32.120 --> 23:35.760]  doors open to Syria refugees heading to Europe unless his list of demands are
[23:35.760 --> 23:46.840]  met that's mainstream news Greece pushes back migrants on Turkish border onslaught
[23:46.840 --> 23:51.720]  Erdogan warns millions of refugees will move to Turkey border with the EU but the
[23:51.720 --> 24:00.160]  only way this gets out is when you share the information. Turkey has invaded
[24:00.160 --> 24:12.120]  Europe Turkey has invaded Europe the UN and George Soros bringing thousands of
[24:12.120 --> 24:19.480]  boats a week out of North Africa an invasion red alert red alert red alert
[24:19.480 --> 24:24.960]  you know that sound they've got the Star Trek I'm gonna find the Star Trek red
[24:24.960 --> 24:31.200]  alert sir and I can't do it with my voice but that's what this is this is the
[24:31.200 --> 24:34.680]  new world order the virus was created by the globalist and deployed to bring
[24:34.680 --> 24:38.640]  down the economy right as Islam watches attack it's the chai comms the
[24:38.640 --> 24:42.600]  globalist with Islam and the devil worshipping had a foul Hollywood trash
[24:42.600 --> 24:49.320]  that's who they are now here's Greg Reese's incredibly important report and
[24:49.320 --> 24:56.960]  the only way this report gets out ladies and gentlemen is if you share it it's
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.360]  posted at Bandot video Greece under Islamic invasion red alert here it is
[25:03.360 --> 25:08.280]  president Erdogan says millions of migrants will head to Europe through
[25:08.280 --> 25:19.280]  Turkey in what reality is this not an invasion an act of war we see video
[25:19.280 --> 25:26.760]  of a calm baby being held in the smoke of a fire slapped on the back and
[25:26.760 --> 25:33.200]  shaken a woman approaches the baby and appears to fake hysteria and there are
[25:33.200 --> 25:38.280]  other babies subjected to this trauma and then handed off to military age men
[25:38.280 --> 25:44.080]  who run off with them the mainstream media show this video and claim they are
[25:44.080 --> 25:51.160]  tending to the children who have been tear-gassed what do you think another
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.920]  video clearly shows migrants putting on an emotional show directly for the
[25:55.920 --> 26:03.480]  camera camera crews are in the frame and yet the hordes of migrants seem to all
[26:03.480 --> 26:10.440]  be young men spreading litter and starting fires no families no women no
[26:10.440 --> 26:18.520]  children what do you see it is an invading army given cover by the
[26:18.520 --> 26:25.440]  mainstream media and not all hide their true intentions we're not here we're
[26:25.440 --> 26:35.120]  not Europe but Greece is fighting back a migrant was shot the army has secured
[26:35.120 --> 26:41.720]  the border NGO workers and facilities are being attacked and vandalized by the
[26:41.720 --> 26:45.240]  fed up people of Greece
[26:47.800 --> 26:54.200]  the story is developing for info wars dot com this is Greg Reese
[26:54.200 --> 27:11.160]  this is the Islamic invasion and they know what they're doing and you see the
[27:11.160 --> 27:17.640]  women rounding their babies on camera and then they start rolling you see them
[27:17.640 --> 27:22.320]  putting them in the fire to make them cry then you see the enemy media CNN
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.880]  and others showing it to you because they know you've got a heart they know
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.560]  you've got a soul these people are known to get into checkpoints with bombs
[27:31.560 --> 27:34.000]  planted under them with a baby in their arms because the police don't think you
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.720]  blow a baby up and they'll blow those babies to bits they're nothing to them
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.560]  you go there they'll show you no mercy
[27:43.560 --> 27:55.600]  yeah scroll down to show them that the Islamist will show us no mercy and they
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.120]  use babies at the front of a boat of a hundred people they'll have two children
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.720]  and then they'll send them back across and bring them over and over just like
[28:04.720 --> 28:08.760]  illegal aliens use children as human shields to come in here and admit it on
[28:08.760 --> 28:17.160]  tape because the UN is running the whole program and when they get over from
[28:17.160 --> 28:21.360]  the Islamic countries the people out of Latin America come in here do just want
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.000]  a better life thing as they drive down wages and become politically controlled
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.800]  by the globalist but the Islamists to say we're here to take over we're here
[28:29.800 --> 28:35.000]  to get your women we're here to piss on Jesus and you see them staging it and

[31:10.680 --> 31:14.280]  take the Trump rallies over that said about two months ago I came with a plan

[31:18.600 --> 31:23.200]  of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the Democrats save the second
[31:23.200 --> 31:27.280]  amendment defend the first amendment info wars.com and it looks like duct tape
[31:27.280 --> 31:30.240]  but it's just a regular stick you put it over your mouth you go to a Trump rally
[31:30.240 --> 31:33.480]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things people say why are
[31:33.480 --> 31:37.400]  you doing this what's happening when you go well we're being censored you know
[31:37.400 --> 31:40.440]  Trump won't do anything about it and Dr. Pachennick let me just ask you what
[31:40.440 --> 31:44.800]  you think because I've not launched this yet it's brilliant you've taken the very
[31:44.800 --> 31:49.240]  element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a
[31:49.240 --> 31:53.840]  weapon you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most
[31:53.840 --> 31:58.560]  disturbing to people silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence...
[31:58.560 --> 32:04.200]  at the end of World War Two at all Hitler had discredited the eugenics and
[32:04.200 --> 32:10.100]  world population control organizations they openly had meetings and led by Julian
[32:10.100 --> 32:12.440]  and Huxley, all this Huxley's brother,
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.400]  decided to repackage themselves as transhumanists.
[32:16.400 --> 32:19.720]  Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent
[32:19.720 --> 32:23.320]  that people can be turned into cyborgs,
[32:23.320 --> 32:26.120]  that robots can be given rights, you name it,
[32:26.120 --> 32:28.520]  they are intimidating and arresting people
[32:28.520 --> 32:33.040]  all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[32:33.040 --> 32:35.920]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking
[32:35.920 --> 32:40.560]  what someone is if you can't even tell what they are.
[32:40.560 --> 32:43.800]  This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control,
[32:43.800 --> 32:46.640]  and there's several big articles up on infowars.com
[32:46.640 --> 32:47.960]  that break this down.
[32:47.960 --> 32:49.920]  UK teen fine under house arrest
[32:49.920 --> 32:53.600]  for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother,
[32:53.600 --> 32:55.760]  spare jail for misgendering trans woman
[32:55.760 --> 32:58.240]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[32:58.240 --> 33:04.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.240 --> 33:34.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:58.240 --> 34:11.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.240]  Alex Jones here back live.
[34:13.240 --> 34:19.240]  We have accurately in a really unbelievable way chronicled
[34:19.240 --> 34:23.240]  exactly what was gonna unfold with this deadly coronavirus
[34:23.240 --> 34:26.240]  because we were looking at it from the perspective
[34:26.240 --> 34:30.240]  of the globalist in history and how they've responded
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.240]  and what they've done before and we've war-gamed
[34:34.240 --> 34:40.240]  every aspect of it that we personally could.
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.240]  But from day one, in the response to it
[34:45.240 --> 34:48.240]  and the way the media globally was unified
[34:48.240 --> 34:50.240]  and the way authoritarian countries were unified
[34:50.240 --> 34:55.240]  in using it as a political crackdown, we knew it was big.
[34:55.240 --> 34:58.240]  And we asked the question, is it just a political hoax
[34:58.240 --> 35:00.240]  to grab power and hurt the economy
[35:00.240 --> 35:03.240]  and hurt nation-states and populists?
[35:03.240 --> 35:08.240]  Or is it really deadly, super deadly as well
[35:08.240 --> 35:11.240]  and very communicable?
[35:11.240 --> 35:13.240]  And is it both?
[35:13.240 --> 35:15.240]  That was five weeks ago.
[35:15.240 --> 35:19.240]  We then learned a few days later, four and a half weeks ago
[35:19.240 --> 35:22.240]  that major Indian university
[35:22.240 --> 35:25.240]  that has the CRISPR gene editing system
[35:25.240 --> 35:29.240]  scanned the virus with high-powered electron microscopes
[35:29.240 --> 35:33.240]  and saw it was actually a composite virus
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.240]  with the gene editing incision points
[35:37.240 --> 35:42.240]  and protein markers in place, the scars, the signs,
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.240]  all of it right there.
[35:47.240 --> 35:50.240]  At that point, we stood back
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.240]  and I said, and I don't have the crew to do this,
[35:54.240 --> 35:56.240]  but you all heard it, you all saw it.
[35:56.240 --> 35:58.240]  You were regular listeners.
[35:58.240 --> 36:00.240]  I said, within a month to two months,
[36:00.240 --> 36:07.240]  store shelves are going to be empty in the United States.
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.240]  And I said the cover-up of this may be
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.240]  what creates the massive hysteria.
[36:15.240 --> 36:18.240]  Well, now it started a few weeks ago.
[36:18.240 --> 36:20.240]  I told you that around military bases,
[36:20.240 --> 36:22.240]  people that know what's going on,
[36:22.240 --> 36:25.240]  they had cleaned off store shelves
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.240]  in places like Costco, Sam's Club, and Walmart
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.240]  of essential items, not just the mask.
[36:32.240 --> 36:35.240]  Now, since last week, Costco's across the United States,
[36:35.240 --> 36:38.240]  Europe, Walmart, other facilities have been stripped dry.
[36:38.240 --> 36:42.240]  We have just article after article,
[36:42.240 --> 36:45.240]  video after video of that happening.
[36:45.240 --> 36:50.240]  Then Trump comes out when the stock market drops 15%
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.240]  and says the media's response in hysteria is a hoax,
[36:55.240 --> 36:57.240]  not the virus is a hoax,
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.240]  but the super end of the world hyping of it is a hoax,
[37:01.240 --> 37:05.240]  which is true to hurt the economy.
[37:05.240 --> 37:08.240]  But it doesn't matter because the globalists have been so good
[37:08.240 --> 37:11.240]  at hyping it and locking down China,
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.240]  and China shot all those videos hyping it
[37:13.240 --> 37:15.240]  and shot real people at checkpoints
[37:15.240 --> 37:17.240]  and welded people into their homes
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.240]  like a Day of the Dead Armageddon movie.
[37:21.240 --> 37:22.240]  People saw that.
[37:22.240 --> 37:24.240]  That wasn't fake that they were walling people in
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.240]  and welding them into their homes.
[37:26.240 --> 37:28.240]  It wasn't fake that people were dying,
[37:28.240 --> 37:30.240]  but who knows what they were really dying from?
[37:30.240 --> 37:32.240]  That stuff they're spraying on them?
[37:32.240 --> 37:34.240]  All we know is the globalists are making their move
[37:34.240 --> 37:37.240]  and it's been proven accurate.
[37:37.240 --> 37:40.240]  But it isn't about sitting here saying,
[37:40.240 --> 37:45.240]  we've been proven accurate.
[37:45.240 --> 37:52.240]  It's about saying,
[37:52.240 --> 37:55.240]  how do we stop this?
[37:55.240 --> 37:58.240]  We've proven that we've done the analysis,
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.240]  the listeners, the callers, the guests,
[38:01.240 --> 38:04.240]  all these experts together in our brainstorm.
[38:04.240 --> 38:06.240]  We know it's man-made.
[38:06.240 --> 38:08.240]  We know that they've totally hyped it
[38:08.240 --> 38:10.240]  and are using it for martial law from Italy
[38:10.240 --> 38:14.240]  to Russia to China to North Korea.
[38:14.240 --> 38:23.240]  And we know that President Trump is saying it's hype.
[38:23.240 --> 38:25.240]  There's a real problem, but they're hyping it up
[38:25.240 --> 38:27.240]  bigger than it is to hurt the economy.
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.240]  And that's dead on and we predicted they would do that.
[38:32.240 --> 38:34.240]  But the way the media split it now,
[38:34.240 --> 38:36.240]  they've been somewhat successful to control media
[38:36.240 --> 38:38.240]  and making it two different discussions.
[38:38.240 --> 38:43.240]  It's either totally a hoax and nothing's happening,
[38:43.240 --> 38:46.240]  which we know that's not the case.
[38:46.240 --> 38:47.240]  There's a real virus there.
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.240]  How deadly it is, you can debate.
[38:49.240 --> 38:54.240]  Or it's the end of the world as mainstream media is saying.
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.240]  When the truth is they've released a virus that does kill,
[38:57.240 --> 39:00.240]  it looks like at least 1%, maybe 2% of people.
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.240]  And I have a graph we'll show in a moment.
[39:04.240 --> 39:06.240]  And it does spread really, really fast.
[39:06.240 --> 39:08.240]  And they did cover up the fact that it was already in the U.S.
[39:08.240 --> 39:10.240]  a month ago, like we told you, and that's even
[39:10.240 --> 39:13.240]  in the Boston Globe today.
[39:13.240 --> 39:15.240]  And we've seen all these globalists get up on TV
[39:15.240 --> 39:17.240]  and show that they're sick and all of this
[39:17.240 --> 39:20.240]  to help create hysteria.
[39:20.240 --> 39:26.240]  In a moment, I'll go to this graph.
[39:26.240 --> 39:31.240]  But it's a big deal whether it was a total hoax
[39:31.240 --> 39:35.240]  or whether it's absolutely super deadly.
[39:35.240 --> 39:37.240]  Because the globalists are unified
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.240]  and are making their move on the economy to bring down Trump.
[39:41.240 --> 39:43.240]  And now the Democrats last week were admitting it,
[39:43.240 --> 39:45.240]  saying they hope this brings down Trump
[39:45.240 --> 39:47.240]  and they're rooting for it to bring down the economy.
[39:47.240 --> 39:50.240]  That should bring them down.
[39:50.240 --> 39:52.240]  And Trump needs to come out and not get into
[39:52.240 --> 39:54.240]  whether the virus is deadly or not.
[39:54.240 --> 39:56.240]  Just say we're going to try to handle it more strong
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.240]  and we can deal with it and stiff up her lip.
[40:00.240 --> 40:02.240]  Not say there's nothing there
[40:02.240 --> 40:04.240]  because they could get him on that.
[40:04.240 --> 40:06.240]  They're already trying to frame him as that.
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.240]  We warned him of that.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.240]  We know their moves.
[40:09.240 --> 40:11.240]  This is so obvious, so easy to understand
[40:11.240 --> 40:14.240]  once you really immerse yourself in it.
[40:14.240 --> 40:16.240]  But he needs to point out that the media
[40:16.240 --> 40:18.240]  is trying to hurt the economy
[40:18.240 --> 40:20.240]  and that the media is with the Chai comms
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.240]  and that authoritarian countries like China use this
[40:22.240 --> 40:24.240]  to clamp down their opposition
[40:24.240 --> 40:26.240]  like we told Trump he should do a month ago.
[40:26.240 --> 40:28.240]  So that's where we're at.
[40:28.240 --> 40:31.240]  And that's where I stand.
[40:31.240 --> 40:33.240]  And Pat Buchanan agrees with that
[40:33.240 --> 40:35.240]  and put a big article out last week
[40:35.240 --> 40:37.240]  on February 28th coronavirus crisis.
[40:37.240 --> 40:39.240]  It's Trump's time to lead.
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.240]  Now, let me hit the really scary news.
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.240]  Can we put that graph back up on screen
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.240]  and put it back here for TV viewers please?
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.240]  Now, Mike Adams has put out similar numbers.
[40:52.240 --> 40:53.240]  Others have.
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.240]  This is what the CDC and others have been saying.
[40:57.240 --> 41:00.240]  We can put it up on full screen too.
[41:00.240 --> 41:02.240]  The total U.S. population,
[41:02.240 --> 41:07.240]  327 million plus 30 million illegal aliens.
[41:07.240 --> 41:09.240]  Half the population exposed, they believe,
[41:09.240 --> 41:11.240]  the next six months.
[41:11.240 --> 41:14.240]  That's 163 million people.
[41:14.240 --> 41:18.240]  Coronavirus fatality rate at 2%
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.240]  is what the CDC believes it may be at.
[41:22.240 --> 41:24.240]  We're not sure.
[41:24.240 --> 41:29.240]  That's 3.26 million.
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.240]  Now, I talked to an Army Lieutenant Colonel
[41:31.240 --> 41:36.240]  who's currently in very secretive parts of the government
[41:36.240 --> 41:39.240]  and he said they're preparing for a 2% death rate
[41:39.240 --> 41:41.240]  is what they believe it is.
[41:41.240 --> 41:42.240]  That's a public number too,
[41:42.240 --> 41:44.240]  but this is what the Pentagon thinks in the briefings
[41:44.240 --> 41:46.240]  and that they're looking for 3 million dead
[41:46.240 --> 41:48.240]  in the United States in the next six months to a year.
[41:48.240 --> 41:50.240]  They hope that's an over projection,
[41:50.240 --> 41:52.240]  but that's what they think.
[41:52.240 --> 41:54.240]  And then this morning,
[41:54.240 --> 41:57.240]  I mean, I might have an Army Lieutenant Colonel in my house
[41:57.240 --> 41:59.240]  once a year or something,
[41:59.240 --> 42:02.240]  just on some other business that I was doing and taking care of.
[42:02.240 --> 42:04.240]  This guy retired about a year ago.
[42:04.240 --> 42:05.240]  He's there. I had to leave to work.
[42:05.240 --> 42:07.240]  He's in there having coffee with my wife.
[42:07.240 --> 42:09.240]  She calls me and says, hey, I don't want to travel anymore.
[42:09.240 --> 42:13.240]  He's saying the Pentagon thinks 3 million are going to die
[42:13.240 --> 42:15.240]  with a 2% death rate
[42:15.240 --> 42:20.240]  with half the country set to get infected.
[42:20.240 --> 42:22.240]  And I haven't talked to him yet. She was talking to him.
[42:22.240 --> 42:24.240]  But the point is, that's what the Pentagon's putting out.
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.240]  He said that's what people he talked to that are currently in
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.240]  at those higher levels are saying in Army Special Operations.
[42:31.240 --> 42:35.240]  So this is a big deal if that's true and if that's accurate.
[42:35.240 --> 42:37.240]  And obviously then, you know,
[42:37.240 --> 42:39.240]  Trump is there trying to play it down.
[42:39.240 --> 42:40.240]  He doesn't want to create hysteria.
[42:40.240 --> 42:42.240]  But this isn't going to be millions dying next week
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.240]  or even next month.
[42:44.240 --> 42:46.240]  It's just now starting to replicate,
[42:46.240 --> 42:48.240]  but we've got the numbers on the replication
[42:48.240 --> 42:50.240]  and it's exactly as we thought.
[42:50.240 --> 42:51.240]  Much, much worse than what they were claiming
[42:51.240 --> 42:53.240]  just a week ago or two weeks ago.
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.240]  And that's what creates the hysteria
[42:55.240 --> 42:58.240]  is the playing it down and then proven wrong.
[42:58.240 --> 43:00.240]  It's wonderful that so many people
[43:00.240 --> 43:02.240]  are now thinking about preparedness
[43:02.240 --> 43:04.240]  and that we're seeing record food sales
[43:04.240 --> 43:06.240]  not just here but across the world.
[43:06.240 --> 43:09.240]  That's good. People need to be self-sufficient.
[43:09.240 --> 43:12.240]  The average person is living hand to mouth,
[43:12.240 --> 43:14.240]  paycheck to paycheck,
[43:14.240 --> 43:16.240]  and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[43:16.240 --> 43:18.240]  We need to reverse this trend
[43:18.240 --> 43:20.240]  and start getting prepared.
[43:20.240 --> 43:22.240]  And that means even with just the basics,
[43:22.240 --> 43:24.240]  even a three-week food supply
[43:24.240 --> 43:26.240]  that you know is always there
[43:26.240 --> 43:28.240]  that you only go to in emergencies.
[43:28.240 --> 43:30.240]  That said, boosting your immune system
[43:30.240 --> 43:32.240]  is just as critical or even more so.
[43:32.240 --> 43:34.240]  And things like DNA force plus

[44:02.240 --> 44:04.240]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[44:04.240 --> 44:06.240]  Alex, hey, I just want to say
[44:06.240 --> 44:08.240]  it's great to be back once again
[44:08.240 --> 44:10.240]  and I've never gotten to do this
[44:10.240 --> 44:12.240]  but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[44:12.240 --> 44:14.240]  And that super blue whitening toothpaste
[44:14.240 --> 44:16.240]  is on another level.
[44:16.240 --> 44:18.240]  I use the super blue in the morning
[44:18.240 --> 44:20.240]  and then the whitening at night
[44:20.240 --> 44:22.240]  and it absorbs into your gums.
[44:22.240 --> 44:24.240]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[44:24.240 --> 44:26.240]  I literally just took a turbo course
[44:26.240 --> 44:28.240]  on my way to the gym right now.
[44:28.240 --> 44:30.240]  I've had four shoulder surgeries
[44:30.240 --> 44:32.240]  and a back surgery
[44:32.240 --> 44:34.240]  and that body has made me feel better
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.240]  than any type of physical therapy
[44:36.240 --> 44:38.240]  or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[44:38.240 --> 44:40.240]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[44:40.240 --> 44:42.240]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[44:42.240 --> 44:44.240]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened.
[44:44.240 --> 44:46.240]  In July 2001, go look it up yourself.
[44:46.240 --> 44:48.240]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[44:48.240 --> 44:50.240]  They definitely want us off the air without you or not here.
[44:50.240 --> 44:52.240]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.240]  Allergies, dander,
[45:02.240 --> 45:04.240]  asthma, germs, toxins.
[45:04.240 --> 45:06.240]  There are many reasons
[45:06.240 --> 45:08.240]  why we need to think about what is really
[45:08.240 --> 45:10.240]  the air around us.
[45:10.240 --> 45:12.240]  We may not be able to stop breathing,
[45:12.240 --> 45:14.240]  but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[45:14.240 --> 45:16.240]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system

[46:00.240 --> 46:02.240]  but I
[46:02.240 --> 46:04.240]  promote them constantly.
[46:04.240 --> 46:06.240]  Now, could somebody listen to me
[46:06.240 --> 46:08.240]  and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[46:08.240 --> 46:10.240]  Yeah. Just like I'm telling people,
[46:10.240 --> 46:12.240]  hey, I'm a man. I love women.
[46:12.240 --> 46:14.240]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[46:14.240 --> 46:16.240]  You may have problems with her.
[46:16.240 --> 46:18.240]  You may get a divorce. You may whatever.
[46:18.240 --> 46:20.240]  The point is, I'm just steering you
[46:20.240 --> 46:22.240]  in the direction I went that was successful
[46:22.240 --> 46:24.240]  when I left.

[46:58.240 --> 47:02.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.240]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.240]  live from Austin, Texas.
[47:38.240 --> 47:40.240]  The Army is preparing
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.240]  for 3 million Americans
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.240]  to die from the coronavirus.
[47:48.240 --> 47:50.240]  That does not mean
[47:50.240 --> 47:52.240]  that 3 million people are going to die,
[47:52.240 --> 47:54.240]  but currently,
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.240]  the CDC says they believe
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.240]  it has a kill rate of around 2%.
[48:00.240 --> 48:02.240]  That's a lot better than Lansing
[48:02.240 --> 48:04.240]  a month ago saying 15%.
[48:04.240 --> 48:06.240]  When Trump says it's like the flu,
[48:06.240 --> 48:08.240]  that is incorrect
[48:08.240 --> 48:10.240]  if you believe these numbers.
[48:10.240 --> 48:12.240]  The president may turn out to be right, he usually is.
[48:12.240 --> 48:14.240]  The flu might kill 1-tenth of 1%.
[48:14.240 --> 48:16.240]  Usually run down, old,
[48:16.240 --> 48:18.240]  infirm, pre-existing conditions,
[48:18.240 --> 48:20.240]  bad immune system.
[48:20.240 --> 48:22.240]  Still terrible.
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.240]  So the flu kills
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.240]  30 something thousand people a year,
[48:26.240 --> 48:28.240]  and that's less than 1-tenth of 1%.
[48:28.240 --> 48:30.240]  If it's anywhere close to 2%,
[48:30.240 --> 48:32.240]  we've got the graph up here,
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.240]  that's 3 plus million dead.
[48:36.240 --> 48:38.240]  And with the condition of all the different
[48:38.240 --> 48:40.240]  Democrat cities being giant,
[48:40.240 --> 48:42.240]  festering incubation dishes
[48:42.240 --> 48:44.240]  of run down drug addicts
[48:44.240 --> 48:46.240]  and rats and feces and needles
[48:46.240 --> 48:48.240]  and pre-existing conditions,
[48:48.240 --> 48:50.240]  this could be really explosive.
[48:50.240 --> 48:52.240]  But it's how it will weigh down the hospitals
[48:52.240 --> 48:54.240]  and what it will do to the economy.
[48:54.240 --> 48:58.240]  And the hysteria, it's already committed.
[48:58.240 --> 49:00.240]  So let's go
[49:00.240 --> 49:02.240]  through just the headlines.
[49:02.240 --> 49:04.240]  There's no other way to go through all this,
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.240]  but just to read the headlines.
[49:06.240 --> 49:08.240]  All of a sudden, people all over America
[49:08.240 --> 49:10.240]  are prepping like crazy.
[49:10.240 --> 49:12.240]  BigInfoWars.com article.
[49:12.240 --> 49:14.240]  You'll want to go look at the videos and photos.
[49:14.240 --> 49:16.240]  Coronavirus, panic buying, clear shells at Costco.
[49:16.240 --> 49:18.240]  Told you that was coming a month ago.
[49:18.240 --> 49:20.240]  Iranian pilgrims taunt coronavirus
[49:20.240 --> 49:22.240]  with communal licking of religious shrines

[49:28.240 --> 49:30.240]  could shrink by half
[49:30.240 --> 49:32.240]  thanks to coronavirus,
[49:32.240 --> 49:34.240]  the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development.
[49:34.240 --> 49:36.240]  That's the group, that's the real global government
[49:36.240 --> 49:38.240]  behind the U.N. right there.
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.240]  That's the King Daddy right there.
[49:40.240 --> 49:42.240]  That's the Marshall Plan.
[49:42.240 --> 49:44.240]  Well, no, by the top of the pyramid, that's it.
[49:44.240 --> 49:46.240]  Coronavirus outbreak kills
[49:46.240 --> 49:48.240]  second person in Washington State
[49:48.240 --> 49:50.240]  after first New York case confirmed.
[49:50.240 --> 49:52.240]  Coronavirus may have spread
[49:52.240 --> 49:54.240]  undetected for weeks in the U.S.
[49:54.240 --> 49:56.240]  Boston Globe.
[49:56.240 --> 49:58.240]  Oh, we told you that a month ago.
[49:58.240 --> 50:00.240]  We told you where it would come from, too,
[50:00.240 --> 50:02.240]  Washington State, where we already had sources
[50:02.240 --> 50:04.240]  saying it was spreading from the White House.
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.240]  Florida's first coronavirus cases
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.240]  found in Hillsborough
[50:08.240 --> 50:10.240]  and Manatee Counties.
[50:10.240 --> 50:12.240]  That's the Tampa Bay News.
[50:12.240 --> 50:14.240]  Virus reported in
[50:14.240 --> 50:16.240]  wider region of West Coast.
[50:16.240 --> 50:18.240]  Anxiety
[50:18.240 --> 50:20.240]  mounts among U.S. health workers
[50:20.240 --> 50:22.240]  on the front lines of coronavirus outbreak.
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.240]  That killed a lot
[50:24.240 --> 50:26.240]  of doctors
[50:26.240 --> 50:28.240]  in Asia.
[50:28.240 --> 50:30.240]  A Cal Casino

[50:32.240 --> 50:34.240]  over virus closures.

[50:38.240 --> 50:40.240]  coronavirus ordeal on Diamond Princess

[50:42.240 --> 50:44.240]  This is truly a nightmare
[50:44.240 --> 50:46.240]  how one businesswoman's flight from China
[50:46.240 --> 50:48.240]  ended in coronavirus quarantine, CMBC.
[50:48.240 --> 50:50.240]  Coronavirus is different.
[50:50.240 --> 50:52.240]  It's rapidly hitting supply demand.
[50:52.240 --> 50:54.240]  It's a bomb hitting
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.240]  the supply chain. That's what's real.
[50:56.240 --> 50:58.240]  Because
[50:58.240 --> 51:00.240]  of the globalist hype, the Chai-Com hype,
[51:00.240 --> 51:02.240]  we knew it was going to be big because
[51:02.240 --> 51:04.240]  of their hype. We were analyzing that,
[51:04.240 --> 51:06.240]  not contributing to it.
[51:06.240 --> 51:08.240]  Outbreak fears emerge
[51:08.240 --> 51:10.240]  in Nigeria as government finds 100 people
[51:10.240 --> 51:12.240]  exposed to first virus case.
[51:12.240 --> 51:14.240]  What did we tell you a month ago?
[51:14.240 --> 51:16.240]  That the U.S. had faulty kits that weren't working
[51:16.240 --> 51:18.240]  with the reagent.
[51:18.240 --> 51:20.240]  And that they weren't sending out the code of the
[51:20.240 --> 51:22.240]  RNA
[51:24.240 --> 51:26.240]  so that people
[51:28.240 --> 51:30.240]  couldn't find out how bad it actually was.
[51:30.240 --> 51:32.240]  Why was that done?
[51:32.240 --> 51:34.240]  Because whoever's running things at the CDC
[51:34.240 --> 51:36.240]  wanted China to tank first.
[51:36.240 --> 51:38.240]  CDC
[51:38.240 --> 51:40.240]  teams raced to catch up with spread of coronavirus
[51:40.240 --> 51:42.240]  in U.S.

[51:54.240 --> 51:56.240]  defecting coronavirus test.
[51:56.240 --> 51:58.240]  Where'd you hear about that weeks ago?
[51:58.240 --> 52:00.240]  Next week's news today.
[52:00.240 --> 52:02.240]  That's out of the hill. Panic buying hits
[52:02.240 --> 52:04.240]  New York as first coronavirus case is found
[52:04.240 --> 52:06.240]  in NYC.

[52:18.240 --> 52:20.240]  closes the loo as virus spreads
[52:20.240 --> 52:22.240]  to new fronts.
[52:22.240 --> 52:24.240]  Empty stadiums and no more selfies.
[52:24.240 --> 52:26.240]  Coronavirus becomes a 2020 X factor.
[52:26.240 --> 52:28.240]  Yeah, the black swan.
[52:28.240 --> 52:30.240]  Media and the Democrats fake news claim
[52:30.240 --> 52:32.240]  that Trump called coronavirus a hoax
[52:32.240 --> 52:34.240]  when he said them saying it's the
[52:34.240 --> 52:36.240]  end of the world's a hoax.
[52:36.240 --> 52:38.240]  And boy, the warmest turn even
[52:38.240 --> 52:40.240]  politifact came out and said
[52:40.240 --> 52:42.240]  that Trump was right.
[52:42.240 --> 52:44.240]  That he did not say the whole thing was a hoax.
[52:44.240 --> 52:46.240]  China officials knew coronavirus in December
[52:46.240 --> 52:48.240]  ordered cover up report says New York post.
[52:48.240 --> 52:50.240]  Yep, we told you that first.
[52:50.240 --> 52:52.240]  Chinese doctors perform world's first double lung
[52:52.240 --> 52:54.240]  transplant for coronavirus victim.
[52:54.240 --> 52:56.240]  Here it is, CBS's Scott Paley
[52:56.240 --> 52:58.240]  fact checks Mike's Bloomberg on
[52:58.240 --> 53:00.240]  Trump coronavirus comment finds that
[53:00.240 --> 53:02.240]  he lied.
[53:02.240 --> 53:04.240]  Trump did not say the virus was a hoax.
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.240]  Some election official scrambling
[53:06.240 --> 53:08.240]  to address coronavirus concern
[53:08.240 --> 53:10.240]  ahead of super Tuesday. Yeah.
[53:10.240 --> 53:12.240]  Who will it make not go to the polls?
[53:12.240 --> 53:14.240]  What will it do to the general election? Wow, this is huge.
[53:14.240 --> 53:16.240]  We told you that weeks ago.
[53:16.240 --> 53:18.240]  Again, we war game every angle folks, but they don't like us.
[53:18.240 --> 53:20.240]  They want it to dribble out slowly
[53:20.240 --> 53:22.240]  with their spin on it. Nope, not going to happen
[53:22.240 --> 53:24.240]  while we're still on air. Not while the listeners
[53:24.240 --> 53:26.240]  keep us on air.
[53:26.240 --> 53:28.240]  And then it just goes on from there.
[53:28.240 --> 53:30.240]  It's all coming up.
[53:30.240 --> 53:32.240]  But first, ladies and gentlemen,
[53:32.240 --> 53:34.240]  that's a lot to cover and that's just
[53:34.240 --> 53:36.240]  that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[53:36.240 --> 53:38.240]  It is so important
[53:38.240 --> 53:40.240]  to not just have high quality
[53:40.240 --> 53:42.240]  storable food and we have it
[53:42.240 --> 53:44.240]  and you can get it in five, six, seven or eight weeks
[53:44.240 --> 53:46.240]  depending on what you order.
[53:46.240 --> 53:48.240]  And that's under promising to over deliver
[53:48.240 --> 53:50.240]  because everybody else is sold out
[53:50.240 --> 53:52.240]  and is lying to you. But if you go to
[53:52.240 --> 53:54.240]  m4store.com, you lock it in, you will get it.
[53:54.240 --> 53:56.240]  And if you ordered it weeks ago, well then
[53:56.240 --> 53:58.240]  it's already on its way.
[53:58.240 --> 54:00.240]  That's new customers that have to wait that long,
[54:00.240 --> 54:02.240]  but I want to be specific because we're getting a lot of calls.
[54:02.240 --> 54:04.240]  People saying, well, I don't want to order the toothpaste
[54:04.240 --> 54:06.240]  or I don't want to order the body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[54:06.240 --> 54:08.240]  I don't want to order DNA force plus
[54:08.240 --> 54:10.240]  that boosts my immune system or the nano
[54:10.240 --> 54:12.240]  silver patented skin cream
[54:12.240 --> 54:14.240]  because you don't have it
[54:14.240 --> 54:16.240]  at six to eight weeks. No.
[54:16.240 --> 54:18.240]  If you order on a Friday,
[54:18.240 --> 54:20.240]  then you're going to get it shipped out on a Monday.
[54:20.240 --> 54:22.240]  But if you order on a Thursday,
[54:22.240 --> 54:24.240]  it ships out on a Friday.
[54:24.240 --> 54:26.240]  I mean, we're not as good as Amazon
[54:26.240 --> 54:28.240]  with places all over the country, but
[54:28.240 --> 54:30.240]  we ship right out of Texas and you usually get it
[54:30.240 --> 54:32.240]  wherever you are in the U.S. within three days.
[54:32.240 --> 54:34.240]  We have everything in stock that I'm selling
[54:34.240 --> 54:36.240]  except the food.
[54:36.240 --> 54:38.240]  And our supplier has the high quality
[54:38.240 --> 54:40.240]  food. They got to package it.
[54:40.240 --> 54:42.240]  And they've got to then get it out
[54:42.240 --> 54:44.240]  and they are not going to then be caught
[54:44.240 --> 54:46.240]  with their pants down so they added a two-week cushion in there.
[54:46.240 --> 54:48.240]  But just six to eight weeks.
[54:48.240 --> 54:50.240]  Most folks are going to get it in five.
[54:50.240 --> 54:52.240]  Some of their food they've got right now and are shipping out within
[54:52.240 --> 54:54.240]  days, but they're like, don't even tell people that
[54:54.240 --> 54:56.240]  it confuses them and they're going to get mad.
[54:56.240 --> 54:58.240]  Just tell them six to eight weeks, but
[54:58.240 --> 55:00.240]  I always tell you everything, don't I?
[55:00.240 --> 55:02.240]  So you'll probably get it in five weeks, but
[55:02.240 --> 55:04.240]  we don't know. And the virus is supposed to
[55:04.240 --> 55:06.240]  peak for months and months, like three, four months.
[55:06.240 --> 55:08.240]  But that's not why you want
[55:08.240 --> 55:10.240]  storeable food, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:10.240 --> 55:12.240]  You want it because it lasts 25 years, because it locks
[55:12.240 --> 55:14.240]  in price now to beat inflation, because
[55:14.240 --> 55:16.240]  it's high quality, because it funds the info war,
[55:16.240 --> 55:18.240]  because of economic crises, or because
[55:18.240 --> 55:20.240]  one of the bubble pops, or one of they kill Trump,
[55:20.240 --> 55:22.240]  it's time to get it, and it
[55:22.240 --> 55:24.240]  funds the info war. So don't believe scammers.
[55:24.240 --> 55:26.240]  They're going to tell you they got it
[55:26.240 --> 55:28.240]  when they don't. We are the only major
[55:28.240 --> 55:30.240]  food company. I have the biggest in the nation.
[55:30.240 --> 55:32.240]  They're the biggest people. Trust them. They like them.
[55:32.240 --> 55:34.240]  And we're ready to ship to you within
[55:34.240 --> 55:36.240]  five to eight weeks.
[55:36.240 --> 55:38.240]  Okay, but they have to say six to eight.
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.240]  Just to be safe. Now, let me tell you
[55:40.240 --> 55:42.240]  what you can get shipped to you tomorrow.
[55:42.240 --> 55:44.240]  We have a full spectrum
[55:44.240 --> 55:46.240]  of patented nano silver approved
[55:46.240 --> 55:48.240]  for even over-the-counter sale. Only one approved
[55:48.240 --> 55:50.240]  by the FDA. We're allowed
[55:50.240 --> 55:52.240]  to private label it by the American
[55:52.240 --> 55:54.240]  nanotech company.
[55:54.240 --> 55:56.240]  Super silver,
[55:56.240 --> 55:58.240]  ladies and gentlemen, the strongest over-the-counter
[55:58.240 --> 56:00.240]  wound gel, you put it
[56:00.240 --> 56:02.240]  on before, and it creates an invisible barrier.
[56:02.240 --> 56:04.240]  You do not ingest
[56:04.240 --> 56:06.240]  this. Okay, it's poisonous.
[56:06.240 --> 56:08.240]  It's super, super strong.
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.240]  What is in the super silver
[56:10.240 --> 56:12.240]  toothpaste is not. It's the same nano silver,
[56:12.240 --> 56:14.240]  but a very low dose still knocks out
[56:14.240 --> 56:16.240]  viruses, bacteria. It's incredible.
[56:16.240 --> 56:18.240]  The big entry way is your mouth.
[56:18.240 --> 56:20.240]  I'm going to tell you that in fullwarstore.com,
[56:20.240 --> 56:22.240]  it's still 50% off despite the fact it's about
[56:22.240 --> 56:24.240]  to sell out.
[56:24.240 --> 56:26.240]  And then we have the super silver
[56:26.240 --> 56:28.240]  high quality hyaluronic acid
[56:28.240 --> 56:30.240]  with the vitamins and minerals with
[56:30.240 --> 56:32.240]  the nano silver as well.
[56:32.240 --> 56:34.240]  And because this is totally an original product we did
[56:34.240 --> 56:36.240]  with them and then have to pay for all the patents,
[56:36.240 --> 56:38.240]  even though it's the same silver, it's
[56:38.240 --> 56:40.240]  a third the price as the
[56:40.240 --> 56:42.240]  super silver wound gel that is super
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.240]  strong, but still have to pay for the patent
[56:44.240 --> 56:46.240]  with this. That's why it's really expensive
[56:46.240 --> 56:48.240]  for us to buy this. We get very inexpensively
[56:48.240 --> 56:50.240]  so we can pass that saving on to you.
[56:50.240 --> 56:52.240]  They have it in the big tubes,
[56:52.240 --> 56:54.240]  in the 3.4 ounces,
[56:54.240 --> 56:56.240]  and they have it in the
[56:56.240 --> 56:58.240]  1.2 ounces.
[56:58.240 --> 57:00.240]  They have it with a natural
[57:00.240 --> 57:02.240]  grapefruit smell or no smell at all
[57:02.240 --> 57:04.240]  and it's another invisible barrier. Plus it's so good
[57:04.240 --> 57:06.240]  for your skin. Women get this. They go,
[57:06.240 --> 57:08.240]  this is the same stuff they sell at Ulta,
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.240]  just a hyaluronic acid for like 30, 40 bucks.
[57:10.240 --> 57:12.240]  A big tube of hyaluronic acid is incredible.
[57:12.240 --> 57:14.240]  It's very clean and it's got
[57:14.240 --> 57:16.240]  nano silver.

[57:28.240 --> 57:30.240]  Just as important as getting horrible food.
[57:30.240 --> 57:32.240]  Alright, when we start the next hour,
[57:32.240 --> 57:34.240]  I'm giving the phone number out. Then we have
[57:34.240 --> 57:36.240]  a reporter on from Europe at the front lines
[57:36.240 --> 57:38.240]  of the massive Islamic invasion.
[57:38.240 --> 57:40.240]  This is the biggest Islamic invasion
[57:40.240 --> 57:42.240]  we've seen in hundreds of years and they're doing
[57:42.240 --> 57:44.240]  it again. They always do. They think it's
[57:44.240 --> 57:46.240]  their right to rule us. Burn in hell.
[57:46.240 --> 57:48.240]  Everybody needs food.
[57:48.240 --> 57:50.240]  I'm proud we're selling high quality food.
[57:50.240 --> 57:52.240]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble.
[57:52.240 --> 57:54.240]  This is something you need on your checklist
[57:54.240 --> 57:56.240]  to have done. But for me,
[57:56.240 --> 57:58.240]  it just is a bummer to know
[57:58.240 --> 58:00.240]  that everybody needs food and I had
[58:00.240 --> 58:02.240]  long discussions this morning over an hour
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.240]  long discussion with different individuals
[58:04.240 --> 58:06.240]  at different levels of this. Right now the folks run
[58:06.240 --> 58:08.240]  the plants to get the best idea we have
[58:08.240 --> 58:10.240]  but they want me to say six to eight weeks
[58:10.240 --> 58:12.240]  just so people aren't getting pissed.
[58:12.240 --> 58:14.240]  But understand the last food company,
[58:14.240 --> 58:16.240]  the biggest food company, is now
[58:16.240 --> 58:18.240]  at hundreds of times their regular order
[58:18.240 --> 58:20.240]  and they were having discussions with me
[58:20.240 --> 58:22.240]  about stopping the promotion of food sales
[58:22.240 --> 58:24.240]  next week and at a certain point just saying
[58:24.240 --> 58:26.240]  we're done. Because people aren't going to take
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.240]  food orders out ten weeks. We don't want to sit
[58:28.240 --> 58:30.240]  on your money ten weeks and then just all the
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.240]  weirdness that comes with that. Because we're honest.
[58:32.240 --> 58:34.240]  Under promise, over deliver. But technically
[58:34.240 --> 58:36.240]  it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you
[58:36.240 --> 58:38.240]  to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you
[58:38.240 --> 58:40.240]  so you come back again. We want relationships
[58:40.240 --> 58:42.240]  with you. We're not Satanists. We're the opposite.

[58:44.240 --> 58:46.240]  Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you.

[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:17.840]  I'm going to give the number out next segment get into all the huge news Islamic invasion of
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:23.680]  Europe it was just launched by Turkey it's just insane and our own media saying it's no big deal
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:29.200]  that is all coming up but first this needs to get more attention it's at man dot video
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:33.600]  confronting the corrupt judiciary when they openly engage in crimes here it is
[1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:42.560]  everybody knows Jackson a huge wave that turned everybody knows the human part
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:01:01.360]  God Amy Moment Jackson has committed the most textbook examples of an organized crime run
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:11.120]  fake show trial judge Amy Barman Jackson has been caught rigging the trial of Roger Stone
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:19.040]  with hand select Democrat party operatives that's why the judge is desperately trying to hide
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:25.120]  right now the identities of the jurors we already exposed during jury selection that the jury
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:30.720]  foreman she chose was a high-level former Obama administration official and the judge ordered
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:38.000]  the media not to report on that but we did and that jury foreperson had to step down the Washington
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:46.400]  Post did called for my arrest and judge Jackson is in the news saying I am a criminal because I am
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:54.160]  here exposing that she rigged that jury she is trying to suppress the press she has put gag
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:02:01.600]  orders out to hide her crimes she has been caught putting people on the jury that were high-level
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:07.920]  Democrats and when it came out court she ordered the press not to tell anyone well guess what we
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:16.720]  had our people in there and I released it ladies and gentlemen this judge has been caught rigging
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:29.520]  this trial of Roger Stone and now she is fighting with everything she has ladies and gentlemen
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:37.200]  she is fighting with everything she has to keep the other names of those jurors secret
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:45.360]  why is she doing that well we already know she put one lady on the jury that ran
[1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:51.440]  an Obama administration agency whose husband worked on the Russia probe against Trump
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:57.520]  that is the most flagrant conflict of interest I can imagine that is ridiculous
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:05.360]  then when I exposed that they called for my arrest for exposing that in the Washington Post
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:11.680]  other Obama administration officials then we learned the new foreman the judge tried to keep
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:21.200]  that secret went for Donna Brazil and the DNC and it went for all of us political operatives
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:29.600]  hand-selected to lead the jury this is all happening they've been caught in live time
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:37.280]  well guess what Katsun you're so proud and absolutely helped bring down the house of
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:45.120]  cars and the big city and how you rig that jury and now you're fighting to suppress how you
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:54.560]  rig that jury everybody knows Katsun that you rig that jury everybody knows that you've been caught
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:04:02.880]  doing it the globalists have failed your new world order is coming down as I told you at
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:13.200]  Builderburg in Canada 14 years ago the answer to the 1984 system is 1776
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:23.520]  it
[1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:33.520]  judge Amy Bergen Jackson had fronted the rigging jury it's a band-aid video
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:39.840]  it will fly like a bird on the wind of truth but only if you decide to take action
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:45.920]  only if you decide to share the video only if you decide to take this mission
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:02.720]  we know that the globalists are in trouble humanities waking up to their tyranny how they
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:08.160]  run their scams their Ponzi schemes how they're building a post-human world but we know they're
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:13.680]  going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third-world
[1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:19.840]  countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:26.320]  west and collapse our social services the giant clowered and pivot program the UN also has said
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:33.440]  they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus this is a
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:39.520]  critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:44.880]  people are waking up like never before but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:53.040]  the word about band.video and info wars.com forward slash show that is so important you are at the
[1:05:53.040 --> 1:06:05.280]  center of the resistance you are our only hope defending the republic from enemies foreign
[1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:23.760]  and domestic it's alex jones we are now into hour number two the only 245 days left of this
[1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:30.240]  unbelievably important historic election the year is 2020 and if you just joined us there is no way
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:46.560]  for me to hype up the different facets of just how insane it is that turkey has launched
[1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:56.400]  a massive invasion of europe and is calling it an invasion
[1:06:56.400 --> 1:07:04.640]  and you can go to many foreign newspapers and read the headlines with Erdogan threatening to
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:10.400]  invade now invading people burning children over fires putting smoke in their eyes little babies
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:18.720]  little toddlers then handed to military aged men to make a run for the paramilitary police of the
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:34.880]  border openly using children as a human shield and then watching it and sky bbc cnn msnbc all of
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:42.320]  them run it edited to make it look like the babies have been hit with tear gas and they're getting
[1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:49.280]  the tear gas out of their eyes by putting them over fire smoke you never knew that yes cnn told
[1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:54.240]  you that men can have babies and now they say if you want to help a baby that's been hit by tear
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:59.680]  gas which they haven't you hold them over a fire about an inch over the flame with a smoke in their
[1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:06.000]  eyes yeah that's how you do it and you slap them slap them around a little bit
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.480]  so again next time you get some gasoline your kids high or something next time they get
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:16.960]  just take them over to fire and stick their head in it that's how you take care of it
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:24.960]  oh and men can have babies too and women have penises that's what cnn teaches
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:27.840]  and if they get you to buy that well they can get you to buy anything
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:31.440]  so i want to give the phone number out

[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:38.240]  incontrovertible evidence of of beyond censorship now it's an intentional political thing and it's
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:43.040]  i think some people on capitol hill perjured themselves and these videotapes make that
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.880]  pretty pretty clear so that'll come out in the next week or two so do you think anyone's going
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:51.440]  to be looking at jail time i mean prosecution i don't know i wish i had the power i actually
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:55.600]  i don't wish i had the power i i don't wish i had the power but i do not have the power to uh
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:12:00.080]  to prosecute people i only have the power to bring the information forward and i think the
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:05.120]  information this time is it's really really compelling because it's not just circumstantial
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:11.440]  evidence it the tapes show inside the companies what they're doing on the front lines and they're
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:16.880]  under oath lying about it listen and and the fact is these these insiders are so brave they're heroes
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:21.280]  because they strap a camera to themselves they work for the company they're willing to give it
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.320]  give it all up sacrifice their livelihoods for the public's right to know what's going on and
[1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:32.320]  james you recently did a huge video where you exposed inside abc how they were talking about
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:37.040]  that can you explain to my viewers what that was about this was a tape this week david right the
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:42.800]  veteran news correspondent been there for 20 years and he's saying he's saying that abc news
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:49.120]  does not care the bosses there do not care about reporting news telling the truth it's all about
[1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:54.720]  selling disney products marvel avengers people on good morning america and it's and it's really
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:59.760]  telling because he says he's a socialist this david right news guy not just a democratic social
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:05.360]  says i'm a socialist but he also says that abc news does not give trump enough credit he says this
[1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:11.120]  abc news suspends him for being honest which i don't agree with them suspending people for their
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.440]  honesty they never want to reform their behavior it's the same thing that happened with the jeffrey
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:21.280]  epstein cover-up they they try to find the leaker of the tape instead of the cover-up of the story
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:26.240]  exposing child pedophilia these people will never learn there never seems to be a reckoning they
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:32.000]  don't have the ability to practice introspection so the response is we're at c-pack on the main
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.840]  stage with one of the insiders and we are recruiting more insiders to wear more cameras milley exactly
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:46.640]  will james you are doing such a great job it's all right it's okay we've done that we've done
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:51.680]  that a few times our videographers do that all the time okay james well you have done such a great
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:57.600]  job exposing fake news and how rampant it is especially in broadcast media and it's their own
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:03.520]  people saying this it's not me it's their it's their veteran patrick davis at cnn the clip of him
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.200]  and inside cnn saying we could be so much better than we are we could we we could be so much better
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:14.160]  than we are patrick davis said um i don't even listen to the jeff zucker nine a.m conference
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:19.600]  calls anymore he says it's his words it's just shit he says so he says it could be so much better
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:26.080]  than we are david right saying the commercial imperative is incompatible with news uh it's
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:32.000]  this is the sort of thing that people all say to each other but the people that you know are next
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.480]  to them have those hidden cameras on we feel that we feel that investigating the fourth estate
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:41.120]  is maybe more important than investigating government itself because we got it informed
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:46.880]  the people the right way exactly well thank you so much james thank you for your time i appreciate

[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:23.200]  i'm alex jones your host and we are watching history repeat itself in a bold way
[1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:33.200]  1400 years ago mohammed took over the crossroads of mecca and medina for the spice trade on the
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:43.440]  caravans coming out of east asia central asia what's india today and into far east asia
[1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:50.720]  once he had that power he projected it in his lifetime to take over much the middle east
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:57.760]  100 years after his death he was pushing into the borders of eastern europe the Balkans is the
[1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:06.640]  main area struck for over 1300 years with millions dead on both sides that's nothing compared to the
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:14.640]  hindu's estimated even by mainline government in india that 147 million hindus have died fighting
[1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:22.400]  islam 147 million because they were keeping better records in the west did they were not a medieval
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:29.280]  culture back then in india as we were in the west so we've contained the cancer between india
[1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:36.720]  and between western europe the Balkans which is greece and other areas has been hammered by
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:43.280]  islam and has been taken more than 50 times greece has been under islamic control just in the last
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:51.040]  century before world war two dan lineman is the amazing reporter at europewars.com he's covered

[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:14.720]  segment the next we'll go to your calls this is the footage of the un funded refuse you can
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.120]  on the border of turkey and syria where men are grabbing little children they're putting them in
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:25.040]  the fire and the smoke anybody knows what smoke makes you cry women are telling them to cry to
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.520]  panic them they're handed to militarized men who then use them as human shields to search through
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:38.080]  the greek police this is the most cowardly terrorist activity you could imagine but
[1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:43.200]  islamicists will use a kid at a police checkpoint with bombs under them to blow the little child
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:48.800]  up we all know that the left has a real fetish for this so the media is trying to spin this footage
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:53.920]  on singing in right now and msnbc that oh they were tear gas so they were washing it out with smoke
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:59.920]  and slapping the children that's how you put fires out as per gasoline on your head too as well so
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:04.640]  you help get a little contact problem just take an ice pick and stab yourself in the eye too uh
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:08.960]  not saying literally do that folks this is the level of the lies so here's that raw footage it's
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:13.600]  up on info wars dot com if you're a radio listener here is the shocking torture of children to make
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:18.960]  them cry so that they can run through the police and show the police with crying children as if
[1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:23.200]  they're scared of the police and not the terrorists that have kidnapped them and are dragging them
[1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:33.600]  into a war zone here it is look at these scum look at the culture of the kidnapped women from the
[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:38.240]  little girls that are generous cut off now they torture the child to cry with terrorist filth
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:42.800]  and now they run them into a war zone and more men come back and grab more babies
[1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:51.840]  god almighty you talk about trash folks you talk about law the jungle you talk about
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:54.800]  barbarous cess pits they can't ever get their act together
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:04.880]  africa is fighting for its life to keep the islamics up africa is civilized compared to islam
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:09.200]  the animus aren't even christians and they've got wonderful communities compared to the muslims
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:16.880]  because the muslims will do anything because there's no evil you can't do sex slaves kill
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:24.640]  people because it's all for the greater good of the prophet muhammad and lineman joins us we're
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:28.960]  going to get to the greek police i don't think they should be shooting dead one of these guys
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:33.200]  everybody caught bringing a child to a war zone and torture them they should put a bullet in their
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:37.760]  head they're invading over their country's border that's what you do to protect your border and now
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:42.960]  erdogan has declared war and says an attack and lineman and the media is covering it up this is
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:48.880]  incredible a giant islamic invasion of europe we haven't seen one in over 200 years at this level
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:55.520]  he's calling an invasion and the enemy media is covering for it that's absolutely right alex this
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:00.240]  is definitely another invasion and this one seems to have a lot more animosity behind it than the
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:05.040]  last one at least more openly so we'll have to see how the international media covers this one
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:10.000]  i have seen a bit more pushback on this action even from people like merkel and macron although i
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.480]  don't really take them seriously i think they're just delivering lip service but this is such a
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:19.200]  disturbing development especially with what's already going on in greece which we can get into
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:23.120]  shortly and then also with the spread of the corona virus and just all of the other things that are
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:27.440]  going on in the world right now this layered on top of it really is a disturbing trend well the
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:32.400]  media intends to show these kids they're torturing later in the same videos crossing the police line
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:37.040]  saying look at police making them cry the very same children is this video not smoking gun
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:42.480]  garbage just like when they said that trump was blowing up uh you know with the turks uh
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:48.240]  villages in in syria it's just totally strange and it seems like muslims in just know how to
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:54.240]  stage stuff absolutely they do and also the ngo's that help them at facility that facilitate all of
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.280]  this and that organize a lot of this action that keep them in line to uh to make sure that they
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:04.560]  get the proper photo shoots and to uh stage the right propaganda just a couple of weeks ago we
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:08.720]  had a similar event play out in hungary although on the border of hungary although it was a lot
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:14.000]  less violent the ngo's there were found to be staging a migrant march in which they brought
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:18.160]  children to the front of the line and marched them quite a long ways up to the border with
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:24.400]  hungary and they used the children to sing songs and appeal to the human shields human shields i
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:29.120]  want these human traffickers arrested and if they've got weapons i want their heads blown off
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:32.720]  and that's what you normally do when somebody invades your border and attacks it is burning
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:38.640]  things you repulse an invasion right absolutely and it does seem like Greece is taking a much
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:43.840]  harder stance this time around they do have a bit stronger government in place now and uh
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:48.320]  they seem to be saying that they're just not going to stand for it this time because last year alone
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:54.560]  on record 75 000 migrants came in uh mostly from turkey and about 60 000 of them came over
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:58.560]  on the boats and that was last year unless we clear they burn buildings they murder they
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:03.520]  rape they kill it's health they're destroying the economy and the UN is just pouring more in
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:08.480]  that use children as shields of course the media is so mad this one individual got shot in the head
[1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:13.840]  reportedly he was attacking police with a weapon yeah there's a lot of evidence that the actually
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:19.760]  the turkish intelligence agencies or their troops are actually aiding the migrants as they come over
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:23.680]  there's a lot of speculation about that and of course it's very important oh what you're saying
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:29.600]  any a false flag well there is evidence that they're they're deploying tear gas at the Greek
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:33.920]  border police there's some evidence of that going on there's evidence actually that Erdogan there are
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:39.360]  some videos of of some of these migrants admitting on video saying that Erdogan actually recently
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:44.000]  released them from prison so it sounds like if accurate of course we take these all with a
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.480]  grain assault that could have happened in 2015 or somewhere else they could have happened yesterday
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:52.640]  these migrants some of them are saying that they were just let out of prison so Erdogan might be
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  emptying the prisons of some of the worst I want to be clear if someone's trying to burn a building
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:00.560]  or kill people people need to use legal force and stop laying down to this because they fully
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:04.960]  break the border they're gonna have Islam totally take over Europe people don't know you live there
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:10.960]  I mean most of the cities are now no-go zone hell pits yes even some of the cities that you would
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:15.920]  never expect are starting to turn that way so I mean I recommend if you come to go to the really
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:20.080]  safe countries I always say this go to Poland go to Hungary they don't have any corona yet either so
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:24.480]  another added reason to go there but one of the footage is that you show there a burning building
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:32.320]  is actually the locals apparently fighting back they said a UNHCR refugee migrant reception
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:39.440]  center some of the people attacking the UN invasion bases Dan Lyman stay right there Islam has
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:43.440]  invaded Europe hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times they're invading now I don't want to go
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:47.840]  to their countries and blow them up I just don't want them coming here to enslave me and telling
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:55.440]  me I'm going to submit their sword no you will never make us submit and the west is awakening

[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:07.040]  supported by all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving into sickness
[1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:10.880]  care take care of their health take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:15.680]  greater vitality and I say that from personal experience because I know that the products
[1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:20.880]  that are being offered here I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack that they
[1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:26.560]  have the ampm power pack well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been
[1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:31.440]  on a regular customer in that regard I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's
[1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:36.320]  important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people
[1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:41.600]  to think about these great events in the world one of the priorities has to be to take care of
[1:32:41.600 --> 1:32:48.960]  yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:53.760]  for our families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think like
[1:32:53.760 --> 1:33:04.880]  we do are critical to the future of America you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:06.880]  you
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:25.360]  I am a shotgun rider for the sands you sent to line the desert is my brother my skin is cracked
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:33.680]  and dry I was riding on a folk coast and everything was fine till we took a shorter road to save
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:41.760]  some time the bandits only fired once they shot me in the chest they may have wounded me they may
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:49.360]  have wounded me but they'll never get the best of better men I gotta tell you when you really
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:57.280]  study the history of it I've probably only read 10 books on the Islamic invasions of Europe and
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:04.800]  the countering crusades they are incredible but they knew that they were going to lose France
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:11.760]  Germany Poland and other areas if hungry and if Serbia and of other areas fell because they were
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:19.200]  barely holding them back for a thousand years almost a thousand years as the crusades were in
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:26.480]  the 1200s 1300s 14 yeah they were holding back about 800 years and so England had to lead the
[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:31.280]  attack with the with the Normans and the French and and go four five thousand three thousand
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:38.720]  miles in and just millions died folks holding Europe millions it's estimated that just some
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:44.240]  of the crusades in a decade were millions you mean you talk about wars back then where almost no
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:51.440]  men came back because the Muslims would take over enslaved kill the men breed with the European
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:56.400]  women and make more soldiers and so they had to Western Europe had to invade
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:06.080]  I mean that was like going to Mars for them to on horses and on foot to get on barges and ships
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:12.640]  from England and France and then go all the way to the Mediterranean and land to fight the Muslims
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:20.720]  because they wouldn't stop attacking and if Europeans captured you back then they were
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:25.360]  Christian they didn't kill the children and you know rape all the women the Muslims did
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:29.520]  so Dan I'm ranting about this but the more you learn about it and then the left and the media
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:35.200]  worshiping Islam and the and the Islamics torturing the kids to cry in front of news cameras caught
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:41.200]  and watch all the Europeans at the NGOs directing the Muslims I mean imagine being those NGOs
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:48.800]  scum from the UN telling them to stick babies in fires for CNN I mean how did they find such scum
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:55.760]  Dan there's a lot of scum like that it is pretty incredible but you know the good news is at least
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.960]  in Greece right now they're starting to push back I did see some video of them actually confronting
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:05.520]  NGO journalists and taking all their gear and throwing it in the water and people saying you
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:09.760]  know next time we catch you here it's not your gear going in the water so I mean these people
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:13.920]  look like radicals doing that of course they're just defending their their town in their homeland
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:18.000]  now this footage you're showing right here actually is interesting this is apparently
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.880]  in Turkey and these are Erdogan's they call them the gray wolves there is his young radicals and
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:28.560]  they are actually reportedly attacking Syrians in their homes and at their businesses and trying
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:33.120]  to flush them out of Turkey and flush them into Europe what do you think that the international
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  reaction would be if this was happening in Germany and it was Germans trying to drive the Syrians
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:41.840]  out of their country how much coverage you think this would get it would be a total media blowout
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:48.560]  on this meanwhile this is happening in Turkey and it gets almost no coverage at all notice the Turks
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:54.800]  are making a sign that looks like the devil if you're a westerner people believe that this is the
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:37:00.000]  sign of the devil no it's not in Eastern Europe the Middle East this is the sign warning off the
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.840]  devil so they're driving the refugees out of their homes as a weapon to flush them into Europe because
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:12.480]  Europe didn't pay the ransom to Erdogan the dictator Erdogan putting potato patata and
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:17.360]  he's all on record saying this and there they are making the sign of warning off the devil
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:21.920]  saying we're driving the devils out it's pretty amazing he's been saying he's going to do this
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:27.600]  for months now and of course for years that the EU has supposedly been paying him off to
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:32.400]  hold back the hordes back there I mean they've they always say between three and five million
[1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:37.440]  migrants are being held in Turkey and despite Erdogan saying for months saying that he was
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:41.120]  going to do just this he warned us he actually said you know months ago that he was going to
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:47.280]  the EU made virtually no preparations ahead of time to defend the the the continent from this
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:51.440]  invasion and and I find that so disturbing and now essentially right now it's just Greece
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:56.320]  handling things on their own and they're already stretched very thin and ironically they're fighting
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:00.000]  against the locals on the islands who are actually protesting against the building of
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.960]  migrant centers there so you have some riot police and some Greek you know soldiers deployed to
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:09.360]  deploy to the islands to basically defend the migrants right to come over and then you have
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:13.840]  the rest of them deployed to the to the border to keep migrants out I mean it's just it's a mess
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:18.560]  and and unfortunately Greek is bearing a brunt to this and they have never recovered from the
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:24.400]  financial crash and they never recovered from the 2015 migration crisis so it's just load after load
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:30.320]  of bad news for Greek people it's so unfortunate all right in the time we have left here in the
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:35.920]  next five minutes we have your reporters.com reporter Dan Lyman your reporters.com everybody
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:41.920]  bookmarked that and share it critical reporting critical intel is this not a total invasion the
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:45.600]  biggest Islamic invasion in a long time even bigger in the last few years and the media
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:49.360]  trying to run interference what comes next what else are you watching and how does the coronavirus
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:56.080]  tie into this well it is such an interesting time to be in Europe and a little bit unsettling of
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.560]  course and of course who knows how many of these people are carrying the coronavirus how many of
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:06.160]  them came through Iran so I mean you have yet you compound these issues that are that are facing
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:10.320]  Europe at this time I really do hope that Greece holds a line and I hope they get support from
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:14.720]  the international community certainly from the EU hopefully from NATO although that's a little bit
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:19.600]  dicey because Turkey's in NATO so we have some issues there and then of course yeah we're watching
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.320]  the coronavirus thing just spread daily it's it's just getting a little unnerving there's so many
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:28.960]  different events being canceled public gatherings over certain sizes are being canceled and and every
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:34.960]  country that a couple days ago only had a few cases is now rocketing past 40 rocketing past 100
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:40.320]  the airports are eerie the some of the towns and the cities are starting to get a little quiet
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:44.960]  the supermarkets are starting to have shortages in some places so I mean people are really getting
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.480]  a little bit freaked out and I think with good cause of course it's it's a bit unsettling
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.360]  Dan this is so historic and it's so archetypal and you go see all these
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:01.120]  movies where the the crusades are evil and we invade the Muslims and their poor little cupcakes
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:08.400]  and everything and they invaded us that's a historical fact over and over and over and over
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:13.280]  and over again and Russia fought them and stopped them and the Serbs fought them and stopped them
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:17.280]  and the Hungarians fought them and stopped them and the Serbs all all these groups and
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:22.160]  they went all the way as you know up to the edge of Germany and Poland they had giant huge wars
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:26.880]  and then it's none of it's even taught in schools and you talk to the Muslims they say
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:33.040]  we're coming to get you and rape your wife you are scum and I don't think people understand
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:36.560]  what it's like and they and the media sells it like the Muslims are these pious people
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:41.840]  they deal drugs they guzzle alcohol they use the welfare system on average I don't think people
[1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:46.560]  understand you're in Europe that they've adopted a weird gang banger culture so it's like a bunch
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:52.000]  of welfare gang bangers just running around pissing and crapping and raping everybody I mean you
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:58.400]  cannot overestimate the evil we're dealing with not only that but the violence it goes
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:02.320]  amongst themselves as well of course in these migrant camps and then once they get into the
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:07.920]  cities they get into their own clicks they get into their own you know sex and then they go
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:13.040]  after each other and so for instance in Sweden you have this explosion of gang violence and it's
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:19.360]  drug gangs from Nigeria fighting each other and Somali gangs and so it's people just say oh they
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:23.280]  lump all these people in as just one group of migrants or refugees and they forget that these
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.160]  people all hate each other as well and they will settle their scores with extreme violence and they
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:32.800]  do all the time and not only that they'll inflict that violence against Europeans as well often
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:37.680]  against children and women it really is disgusting the way that Europeans are handling this the
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.880]  leftist Europeans and and people who know that this is wrong and this is this is changing the
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:46.720]  future for their children and their grandchildren they need to stand up they need to speak up and
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:50.800]  stop being afraid of being called a racist being called a bigot being called an Islamophobe whatever
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:55.200]  you're afraid of being called you need to stop because your your grandchildren your children
[1:41:55.200 --> 1:41:59.760]  are going to have really terrible lives as they already are in many parts of Europe now
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.880]  being victimized by these gangs and by the kids that get put into their schools that that have
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:08.720]  no respect for them and attack them and we've seen so many stories like that out of Sweden and
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.680]  Germany and the UK the list goes on and on it really is hard to cover sometimes on a daily
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:19.520]  basis because there's so many negative terrible stories Dan what else are you expecting to come
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:24.480]  out of this mate will this finally awaken Europe to kick the socialists in the UN out that are
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:27.440]  engineering this I don't think the UN is going to get away with this I think they've been off
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:32.240]  more than their communist asses can chew I'm not sure if they will but I do hope that some good
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:35.680]  things come of this that people that these countries stop start defending their national
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:41.520]  borders and that more nationalist populists start getting elected to high ranking places of power
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:45.440]  and I hope the people putting little children in fires to make them cry before they run up
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:51.040]  police lines get put in prison for a long time and yeah I say it shut their faces in a fire and
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:56.480]  see how they like it Europe Wars dot com Dan Lyman spread that link great job everybody needs food
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:01.360]  I'm proud for selling high quality food elections globalism the economy the bubble this is something
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:07.120]  you need on your checklist to have done but for me it just is a bummer to know that everybody
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:11.280]  needs food and I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:15.520]  different individuals at different levels of this right now the folks run the plants to get the best
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:20.160]  idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed but
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:25.200]  understand the last food company the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:30.240]  regular order and they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:34.400]  next week and at a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food orders
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:38.720]  out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:42.800]  with that because we're honest under promise over delivered but technically it's going to be six to
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:46.800]  eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back

[1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:04.160]  the western world from high school to college sports to even the olympics men biological men
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:12.080]  are winning almost all of the sporting events this is men invading women's faces and bullying them
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:17.760]  and taking their rights away all in the name of the liberalism and openness and then every day
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:24.160]  i have stacks of news articles just like today uk team find under house arrest for asking trans
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:31.280]  police officers gender and it hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:38.640]  ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:44.240]  that's the thought police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason you get
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:50.400]  fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:57.200]  and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it there's roughly

[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:27.840]  quick thing now i can't square to this but one of my right lower molars was like loose i mean i'm
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:35.200]  52 years old and it's not loose anymore now i'm not going to say that you know i know you can't
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:41.600]  say all that kind of stuff but that stuff is just destroying the bacteria i mean it's it's
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:48.080]  got to be there's no other everything i used did nothing all the prescriptions from the
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:54.000]  dentist office did nothing and now the dentist is like well you don't need surgery anymore
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.360]  well i'll tell you this this is this has been approved for over the counter sale this nano
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:06.160]  silver but it's so effective on bacteria and on viruses at a gut level i don't use it every day
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:10.480]  i'm like man something killing bacteria and viruses like this is this really good i'm just
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:17.280]  it's been a shape and effective they say i'm just saying silver is not a game and that's why it
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:21.600]  works so well so just use it according to what you think's best gauge your own body you see what
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:27.200]  i'm saying oh yes sir and it uh it works very well and like like i said i've been listening
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:32.800]  for 20 years this is my first order everything you've been promoting i've never ordered i was just
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:38.560]  a little skeptical and then even my wife is still like uh just get on just get on ownership
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:44.720]  because this stuff is working but anyway um i want to talk about um these uh what's going on in turkey
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:51.120]  and um you know crossing all these Muslims across the border in europe you know they're a
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:59.760]  nato member and there is nothing in the nato charter um we can't support the nato member until
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:05.920]  they are attacked well turkey has not been attacked they actually attacked another country if you move
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:11.840]  your troops across another border and then you gather all these people up and move them through
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:19.040]  your country into another country which is up in the greece you know something's wrong that is a
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:24.000]  classic military attack in fact the huns would bring their population behind them this is a this
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:29.360]  is a tell of the hunt activity but iraqan or iraqan depending on how you say it he said for three
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:38.000]  years he'll do this he calls it a weapon i mean he's declaring it yeah i i think what what uh
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:43.200]  president trump needs to do he needs to act like charles the hammer martel from france
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:49.600]  and just whenever whenever the muslims just invaded spain he said no you're not coming into europe
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:56.640]  and went into spain and and just thrashed them and actually ordered his troops take no prisoners
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:06.400]  these people are just heathen idiots wipe them out if he actually issued orders if you if that if
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:12.880]  a french shoulder is witnessed taking prisoners you will be killed along with the muslims now i'm
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:20.640]  not saying that we need to go out and kill muslims of course but president trump needs to just tell
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:28.000]  nato hey this this stops now you know this is no different than Assad gassed his own people
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:34.960]  and we all know what a hoax that was no sir you're absolutely right this is insane level
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:40.880]  invasion using babies as human shields it's so criminal and again we've got an islamic country
[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:49.600]  on europe's border what do you expect from a rattlesnake this should really be easier than

[1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:52.720]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[1:58:52.720 --> 1:59:00.480]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those
[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:06.080]  of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and
[1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:11.680]  they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting
[1:59:11.680 --> 1:59:17.120]  these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:22.960]  do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate
[1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:28.880]  and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves
[1:59:28.880 --> 1:59:37.200]  but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake
[1:59:37.200 --> 1:59:44.160]  they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever
[1:59:44.160 --> 2:00:00.080]  have to know is that god is in charge you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:22.000]  how many times must i tell you we're taking your phone calls until the third segment next hour

[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:33.760]  party that have not dealt with this country is going to disintegrate but it's very easy to deal
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:39.600]  with i went to cpac to see it for myself and uh so i got some bad news for you but the good news is
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:48.560]  is this festering boil on our ass there's only a few up and we can easily have the public
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:54.880]  politically lance these creatures in a nonviolent way uh so that's all coming up let's go back to
[2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:58.480]  your phone calls now i can't spend a whole second with each call it was a great last caller but
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:03.600]  let's just kind of get through everybody here let's go to joe in california on the same subject
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:10.480]  the giant islamic invasion by turkey of southern europe and the balkans unbelievable attack using
[2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:16.000]  tortured children as human shields how you doing alex thank you for taking a call thank you sir
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:27.120]  you know you look at turkey and uh all i see is soros's name all over this um i think that
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:33.680]  with all the confusion and the coronavirus this was a perfect time uh the best recipe to start
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:42.400]  confusion and and try to bring europe down bring the whole economic european economy down with
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:48.800]  coronavirus and having the uh the invasion i think what needs to be done is i think that
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:58.800]  uh the european leaders like merkel macron orce johnson duda matarella uh azimovs from
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:04.720]  check republic they need to get together they need to talk to possibly make a call into
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:12.560]  putin i know putin's uh real um well turkey's real close with with russia and i know that uh
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:17.120]  well you show your smarts the way to deal with this is put pressure on putin to put pressure on
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:21.920]  turkey right i mean you know turkey buys a lot of their military equipment you know
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:28.640]  trump and uh aragon turkey can't stand us they just politically have to stand by us because
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:33.200]  you know we're superpower but and turkey's argument is the west started this for the
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:38.240]  arab spring they're having to clean it up but even before the arab spring 10 years ago this dictator
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:44.400]  erdogan erdogan he was using islamic invasions to threaten europe and say let me have an islamic
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:49.440]  party in europe or i'll do this well you that's like let me put handcuffs on you and i won't torture
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:53.840]  you to death like ted bundy would say hey put these handcuffs on i'll be nice to you honey
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:59.360]  but once you put the handcuffs on you're dead i mean the guy is unbelievable you know if if if
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:04.000]  if putin comes in and says something to him and this changes you know he could come out looking
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:09.600]  real good so that's my take on well i'm gonna say putin doesn't put up with the islamics invading
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:16.480]  them no no and so you know what i mean turkey's out of control and you know how about the west
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:21.360]  retake turkey i mean i'm not calling for a war here but that used to be western soil how about
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:26.560]  how about we see a you know the tanks roll into there if he keeps invading i mean most the most
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:30.000]  people in turkey don't want to be in islam under islamic rule either but see we never do that we
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:35.200]  go in and put more radicals in more islamics in because the globalist hate europe and hate christians
[2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:41.040]  we could easily defeat the muslims most muslims don't want to be under that crap but see we don't
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:48.480]  invade them to empower them we invade them to put worse islamics in it's a mess i think it i think
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:53.520]  that trump needs to also get involved maybe make a phone call over to putin but then if he does that
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:59.520]  then he'll the media will go crazy so it's a sticky situation absolutely and you know we've
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:04.800]  got a bunch of bases there back from the cold war back from when they had medium range missiles
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:08.560]  in turkey i had family that was there putting the damn things in back in the fifties and sixties
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:15.760]  you know nike missiles all those we don't need that anymore and appeasing the islamist never
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:22.080]  works we need to build a wall and we need to have economic warfare against turkey until they
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:27.360]  stop their invasion crap but again his argument is you the globalists did this you collapsed
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:31.840]  all the borders so i'm not going to put up with it but he's playing that crisis as well
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:36.400]  and you can't appease the pirate as rigger kepler said is you got to pay that crocodile
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:44.800]  over and over again i say we pay that crocodile in total resistance appreciate your call joe

[2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:56.560]  runners are obviously now and put that portends but i didn't see you were calling from germany so
[2:06:56.560 --> 2:07:00.960]  let me go to you first since you've maybe on your own dime mike in deutsch line you're on the air
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:07.360]  thanks for calling hi alex thanks for taking my call what's your view on this giant invasion
[2:07:08.720 --> 2:07:15.200]  well it's it's crazier than we might think you know um this has been going on for a long time
[2:07:15.200 --> 2:07:21.760]  we need to keep it i've got a little reminder here that turkey has been at war de facto with
[2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:28.560]  grace since 1974 when they invaded cyprus that conflict has never been resolved this is just
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:33.440]  another iteration of that age-old conflict that's right that's right grace has constantly been
[2:07:33.440 --> 2:07:41.040]  trying to take back stuff stolen by turkey yep and you know i can also um on a different topic
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:47.920]  here i can confirm uh the stores or at least certain items in stores here in germany emptying out
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:56.240]  it's mostly the basics is toilet paper flour sugar um other basic supplies um you know canned
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:01.600]  goods and that kind of thing they're running a little low on on many fronts on that so evidently
[2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:10.080]  that's tying into that coronavirus and then also um you know and anticipation of about what's the to
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:16.880]  take place with uh the migrants trying to make their way into into germany again well europe
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:21.520]  thinks they can let in a certain amount of islamics to be a detonator to politically control things and
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:25.920]  have no go zones a group they control it's never gonna work the muslims are gonna break down the
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:31.200]  borders flood and just create all forms of havoc until they get their asses kicked out or until we
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:41.360]  fall yeah see merkel's a big uh proprietor of the collergy plan and folks don't know about the collergy
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:49.280]  plan he was uh austrian-hungarian empire royalty married to what japanese royalty and he had a plan
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:58.640]  to islamify europe yep and merkel you know and incidentally he was a nazi and uh merkel's a big
[2:08:58.640 --> 2:09:07.040]  uh you know a defender of the plan and also implementing it in quiet through this uh you
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:14.640]  know uh invasion of sorts um you can't make it up and of course hitler was pro islam and so was the
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:22.080]  polian i mean they've been trying this for a while yes they were with hitler it was it was uh you know
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:30.000]  employed to um essentially rid themselves of the jews but uh you know jew the you know jews and
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.280]  muslims are ancient enemies and so they've been combating each other since day one but today
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:39.760]  it's the left in america a lot of them jews supporting the overthrow of israel and his
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:47.840]  lomification it's just it's crazy yeah um also i have a question uh on a different subject here
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:54.560]  alex whatever happened to the uh executive order that president clinton signed not too long after
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:10:01.200]  ruby ridge that forbade people to put in more than 30 days worth of food supplies because that
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:10.160]  siege precipitated uh all kinds of weird things um you know ruby ridge and waco and uh i haven't
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:15.280]  heard anything whether or not that executive order was rescinded or modified or whatever
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:20.560]  yeah so that's a real executive order that called it food hoarding and boy did that make people buy
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:26.000]  a lot of food i think you know for the guns too but uh years ago i looked into that and i think that
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:31.120]  executive order was overridden later uh because most presidents override most the other previous
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:35.520]  executive orders even if they agree with them they reissue them but no there's no laws on
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:40.720]  hoarding at this point but i assure you uh a societal breakdown happens you don't want people
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:45.440]  to know that you've got a bunch of horrible food mike thank you so much great to hear informed
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:51.280]  people call in to the transmission all right imma in norway imma you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:58.800]  hello welcome welcome what do you think about the islamic invasion turkey invading europe
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:05.440]  well actually i um i have a place in turkey and it's right on the border where a lot of
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:13.120]  refugees are crossing to get to the greek island and i've been spending 10 years uh in the region
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:19.600]  and i know the culture i i you know i have some inside stuff that might be interesting please give
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:26.640]  us your take on this where we're well a friend of mine a few years ago when a lot of refugees
[2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:35.600]  died on the coast uh close to the the um uh the greek island uh samus and cost uh she was actually
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:43.840]  out touring she's hiking every morning she's hiking by the beach and she actually saw a turkish
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:51.600]  coast guard leaving a boat with refugees uh she didn't see that it was refugees but it was a small
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:12:00.400]  boat lots of people crying screaming and he went down and a few days later all the bodies came to
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:09.200]  the beach and so years ago she told me that she was convinced that what she saw was the turkish
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:15.280]  coast guard doing something to actually thinking the boat they wanted it to go down
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:23.680]  so that's one that's one bit and then you have another bit and that is that azuan that is um
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:31.680]  has been had lots of elections and stuff he is manipulating the elections uh but the last
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:41.680]  election he had he was running on um re-establishing the ottoman empire and the turkish people that
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:48.160]  are not too educated they like it because they are taught that it will bring back peace where people
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:55.520]  don't use drugs and become like the western world it will put scarves on the heads of the women and
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:13:02.240]  they will do their prayers and be nice people but in fact if you're going to have back the ottoman
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:08.400]  empire you would have to go to war with a lot of countries well that's right people don't know the
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:14.800]  ottoman empire was involved in world war one on the side of the germans and more and millions
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:19.200]  millions were killed and all the other exploits of it he did announce that he announced he wants
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:24.160]  to invade europe but our media will not cover it just oh you're a muslim you're so good oh
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:29.840]  invade us please and now they're barbecuing kids over fires to make them cry a hundred yards from
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:34.320]  police they then go blaming on and the media goes along with it what is it like for you to see that
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:40.880]  footage well it's not surprising but you have to understand there's a there's a difference between
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:48.400]  most turkish people and other muslims that are more radicalized turkish people in general are
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:55.360]  very nice with kids they are very friendly and hospitable uh and they do not like the radicalized
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:14:00.080]  people they're more arabs thought that is coming into their country well no i understand because
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:04.880]  they were really about most of them were europeans and then in the muslims invaded there so they adopted
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:11.120]  some of the of the european culture absolutely they're they're a muslim light country they are
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:17.040]  kind of like christian light but light but they have just like syria to a lesser extent but but now
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:22.080]  erdogan or irdogan he's saying no no i'm gonna make you full islamic
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:30.880]  yes he's doing that step by step and he has his alliances i suppose with the muslim brotherhood
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:35.680]  and the arab nations and he's making deals with them that is going to give him lots of power if
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:40.160]  he does this and that and i'm sure that you know the western powers are involved as well so
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:47.680]  he's been doing lots of good stuff for turkish for so many years but the latest like five years or
[2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:53.280]  a little bit more than that he's just turned totally crazy he's all about well i mean hitler
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:57.920]  hitler was a bad guy but he built up the economy did quote good things but then he went into the
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:04.720]  war mode and that's what erdogan knows he's going into his expansionist fascist islamic uh mode
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:09.760]  thank you so much expert points and please call us again we really appreciate you okay here's what's
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:14.960]  gonna happen we have gerald salento do a great job every monday he understands sometimes i preempt

[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:06.640]  people keep running rough shot over and everybody i'm i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:11.520]  the trump rallies over that said about two months ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:17.200]  we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:22.320]  democrats save the second amendment defend the first amendment infowarstore.com and it looks
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:26.240]  like duct tape it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth you go to a trump rally
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:30.480]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:34.640]  happening when you go well we're being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:38.800]  dr pacinic i'm let me just ask you what you think because i've not launched this yet it's brilliant
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:45.200]  you've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a
[2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:52.480]  weapon you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:20:11.360]  silence you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:26.240]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[2:20:32.080 --> 2:20:35.600]  all right got loaded phone lines and broadcasting into the fourth hour
[2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:39.040]  taking part of zero simultaneous time he understands he's great i'm alex jones her
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:44.560]  host uh we have harrison smith here with us and on shroyer who are both at cpaq this year and
[2:20:44.560 --> 2:20:53.600]  cpaq's now old news but we went there to test and see how powerful the spirit of neoconism
[2:20:53.600 --> 2:20:59.280]  and of censorship is and i went and everything was okay but then it got really really bad so
[2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:04.720]  this is an important test we did and the creatures that were summoned up from the deep
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:12.320]  uh whale-like creatures of of of of of of tyranny uh and and so we're going to talk about that with
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:20.480]  all the big news going on the fifth column within the enemy within and the reason this is important
[2:21:20.480 --> 2:21:26.240]  is it's these people that are undermining trump it's these people that are advising him badly
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:32.080]  and it's this attitude that's losing liberty the fight worldwide though we're starting to turn
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:36.480]  the tide against it i'll explain and start the next segment but starting with oan shroyer and of
[2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:42.320]  course uh harrison smith big takeaways with clorbature stepping down a judge of the booty
[2:21:43.200 --> 2:21:48.560]  stepping down i mean for me it's a two-way race now uh between the degrading quickly
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:53.440]  joe bite and boy we call that a year ago that he was doddering i mean he's he's rotting quickly
[2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:57.760]  he'll he'll be literally painting with feces on the wall then i think six months i'm serious when i
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:01.920]  say that i've seen dementia before it's very sad actually but he'll be finger painting with
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:07.200]  his own poop very quick versus the evil hateful commie flying around in private jets but says
[2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:12.000]  it's bad if you have any money uh oh and what are you seeing in this election right now well it's
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:16.240]  pretty much i think what we expected from the beginning joe biden is the democrat picky even
[2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:20.720]  though he's unrealistic to actually be the president of united states for the same reasons
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:24.560]  that we've been discussing here on the alex jones your mic's cutting out sorry they don't have it
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.200]  hooked up right get closer to it it's all right let's just go to harrison smith no there's a
[2:22:29.200 --> 2:22:32.560]  fix your mic right now just talk speak up all right yeah we got it guys well they just don't
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:38.960]  have it yeah but go ahead all right it's my mic on yep go ahead right check one two three four okay
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:44.400]  pretty much what we expected biden is the democrat choice for president even though he has no
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:50.640]  realistic capability to be president and then there's sanders who has the grassroots support
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:56.080]  who's kind of fighting the democrat establishment uh in his own right and laid down to it in the
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:00.640]  last election with hillary clinton probably do the same thing i would suspect this election
[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:05.040]  uh but bloomberg hasn't dropped out if i'm if i'm not mistaking i i think bloomberg
[2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:11.280]  is is is the front runner to me he's got the money uh he's not going to go away he's got the will
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:15.840]  i don't think anyone else has the will quite frankly i'm i think biden has the will you think the
[2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:20.080]  tiny tyrant is in is is is in the poll position yeah i think he's the only one that has the
[2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:24.320]  will to be president bernie doesn't he showed that in 2016 biden half the time doesn't even
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:27.440]  know what he's running for what stays in that's a good point because i was saying earlier the
[2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:32.400]  front runners currently if you look at polls and everything would be biden uh was democrat
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:37.040]  party support and then of course sanders but if you look at money and staying power uh the fact
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:41.440]  is bloomberg uh is just probably yet what do you think yeah well yeah bloomberg can just spend
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:46.000]  another half a billion and see where that gets in but the crazy thing is that biden pretty sure is
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:50.240]  now the youngest man in the race right he's the youngest leader at this point which is just absurd
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:56.160]  because 77 77 yeah we see him collapsing in real time and i think also we sort of now know uh the
[2:23:56.160 --> 2:24:02.320]  point of uh peter budigieg why he was in the race he was there to uh sort of stuff stuff
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:07.600]  some of the younger energy away from uh from bernie just to sort of give it back to the party
[2:24:07.600 --> 2:24:11.680]  when the time was right uh i think he served his purpose we know he's got connections uh
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:18.400]  up there and he's totally up there in the booty yes far far in the booty that's exactly right
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:22.560]  i mean he uses the whole gay thing as a distraction doesn't matter on a corporate shell that's totally
[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:28.560]  synthetic i kiss dudes like oh my god that's incredible yeah but you know he he built a
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:33.680]  fairly large base surprisingly because he's basically just not insane he's just a normal guy
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:37.520]  that just says normal stuff and pretends to be christian sure and that's very well whoever the
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:42.800]  hype also ends up in the poll position right i mean look at texas beto stickers were on half the
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:46.560]  cars in austin now you don't see them anywhere they will just bet on anything they're told is
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:53.280]  their god hoping for the next trump Owen well sadly i do see uh beto stickers pretty much regularly
[2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:59.120]  here in austin i just think the democrats are in such disarray right now and they can't even go
[2:24:59.120 --> 2:25:04.240]  with the obvious choice to me which is either sanders or bloomberg decide what you want you want
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:07.680]  to go with the big money candidate who's the business guy who can actually get on the stage with
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:12.880]  trump and debate him on real ideas or do you want to go with the the commie the socialist commie bernie
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:18.480]  sanders those are the two guys they they tested out all these other things oh is warren gonna play no
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:23.440]  oh is uh kissing your husband on tv gonna play oh no the democrats have homophobia too what are we
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:27.520]  gonna do oh let's go with biden well he thinks he's running for senate he thinks he's in arizona
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:31.440]  even though he's running for president he's in colorado okay well i guess we'll just go with him
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:36.000]  anyway it just shows how they're in total disarray it's really a broken party and actually
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.400]  pulse he gathered who would be a great candidate i think would get a lot of support they keep her
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:48.000]  off the stage she may be joining me as my vp that could have him beat even the money of bloomberg
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:52.160]  well that would be interesting but uh gabard has not bowed out yet in fact she's gonna be in austin
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:55.840]  texas tonight i'm gonna go cover her event tonight in austin that's gonna be at 7 p.m so i'm gonna be
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:00.080]  doing that after the war room today so she's still around releasing a new sex tape today as well
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:04.320]  she's still around she hasn't uh she hasn't given up the good fight and i think she has a will to
[2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:08.480]  win but i just don't know if she has the ability to win well i mean she doesn't look like a synthetic
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:11.840]  reptoid a lot of her policies are bad that's what i don't like her though it what is it about the
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:17.120]  democratic party that they want soulless gibbering people that look like they're auditioning for day
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:21.840]  of the dead oh they you know birds of a feather right they flock together and bernie has this
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:26.560]  incredible youth support but i talked to a lot of people at cpac that weren't conservatives you
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:30.560]  know just in washington dc on the flight in uh people that said i'd never vote for trump
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:34.800]  but then i go okay well what do you think about bernie and they run at the term socialism i mean
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:39.440]  socialism is still not popular as much as they can pop it up cancer it's not popular yeah it's
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:44.240]  just strangely enough yeah and especially amongst those who have lived through it you know well yeah
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:48.720]  well my uh uber driver yesterday was from cuba and he as soon as he heard i was in politics he went
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:52.560]  off about socialism was like these people have no idea what they're getting into i mean it's a
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:27:00.400]  bunch of bureaucrats running things and i mean it literally can you imagine uh yeah i mean we we can
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:05.680]  see the examples that you know just south of us so if you run into a socialist in america they're like
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:11.280]  can i they can't find a big the biggest mountain the loudest mega horn to say how bad socialism
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:15.440]  there was a guy from venezuela who comes up to me and he's like begging he's like i have to tell
[2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:18.480]  that it's like i have to get on your live stream he's like come on and so i had him sit down he's
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:22.480]  like you cannot have socialism it will kill you yeah he's like i came from venezuela i saw the
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:28.480]  street but it lets people like me run things don't i need to be your boss now it doesn't matter i'm
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:33.280]  going to kill you if you're a christian uh we don't need to have a price that we just say free
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:39.840]  you don't have that money there are so many deodorants in here we need lines these are real
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:46.000]  no deodorant for you now it's insane last time we were in new york i met a woman who grew up in
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:50.320]  eastern europe i mean she was literally crying being like you have no idea how powerful it is what
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:54.160]  you guys do and how right you are about the threat of communism and socialism well i know a lot of
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:59.040]  people that were even quote liberals you know uh but then like that i don't want to leave from
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:03.680]  check with slavakia when it was under the russians and you couldn't even have art unless they approve
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:07.120]  it wouldn't be political it was all about control of all thought all right we're going to break here
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:14.080]  folks give you an idea of what's coming up i want to go out to break with a short clip of a compilation
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:20.720]  we're going to play of who we learned ran c pack as like a police dog that that marched up and down
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:28.320]  saying remove them remove them when you talk about a villain i introduced to you gorka the titan

[2:29:54.560 --> 2:29:58.880]  i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for
[2:29:58.880 --> 2:30:03.680]  maybe the last week and a half and um i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever
[2:30:03.680 --> 2:30:07.120]  tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and
[2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:13.600]  tell people and oh so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the
[2:30:13.600 --> 2:30:18.800]  best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste
[2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:23.840]  and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:29.440]  because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like
[2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:35.200]  rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like
[2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:39.920]  good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth
[2:30:40.640 --> 2:30:45.360]  three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[2:30:45.360 --> 2:30:47.360]  feels

[2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:24.720]  just took turbo course on my way to the gym right now i've had four shoulder surgeries and the back
[2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:29.840]  surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.680]  i've ever done in my life so i just want to get that out of the way support this man everything
[2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:37.760]  that he exposed nobody knew about behemian growth nobody knew about fd nobody knew about
[2:31:37.760 --> 2:31:43.440]  bill de berg nobody called 9 11 before it happened in july 2001 go look it up yourself well we try
[2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:46.960]  our best sir they definitely want to stop the air without you or not here but yeah these are all
[2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:58.560]  great products so thank you sir we always promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use
[2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:03.520]  them and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden i mean it's just what we're
[2:32:03.520 --> 2:32:08.560]  meant to do it feels good when we do it but we do so high quality swarovl food i told my patriot a
[2:32:08.560 --> 2:32:11.680]  month ago i said what can you handle i said i think it's gonna be really big and they said
[2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:15.040]  we can handle probably this we're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it
[2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:18.080]  forward to be able to fund i said no i think this is going to be huge i think you should spend
[2:32:18.080 --> 2:32:21.520]  everything you have coming in to secure more food even though the prices are going up for you so
[2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:24.960]  those are the type of discussions we have i'm just giving the insight of baseball of all of us this
[2:32:24.960 --> 2:32:30.160]  is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred times a few days ago now it's about 200
[2:32:30.160 --> 2:32:35.120]  times okay at info war store dot com you go right in the queue first come first serve but the fact
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:40.400]  that the orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying i mean this is just insane we're expecting to have
[2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:46.000]  to put six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it continues like this we're looking at having to
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:50.640]  suspend food sales but everybody gets their order in we'll get your food but that's how big this is
[2:32:50.640 --> 2:32:54.160]  so what you're getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of what's going on info war store
[2:32:54.160 --> 2:33:03.760]  dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:25.760]  you

[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:02.000]  i want to be very specific about this but also i'm going to take up all the time
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:09.120]  we have huge news on the corona virus we have massive news on the islamic invasion via turkey
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:13.600]  of europe just unprecedented torturing children have them crying before they run through police
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:19.600]  lines just unbelievable stuff we have so much happening on the economy we have democrats openly
[2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:23.920]  trying to sabotage things and admitting they're trying to sabotage it that should disqualify
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:30.000]  them right there i mean these people are just toned down but it's what happens when you lose
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:35.760]  all your morals you have no bottom you just you just can't even have a spiritual or cultural or
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:42.080]  economic sonar or vision even see what you're doing they're just flailing around best analogy
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:47.200]  i've heard is in that original 1977 movie alien when you've got the android on board and it's
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:50.560]  being killed and it's just flopping around throwing a fit while it's being flamethrowed
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:56.960]  i mean that's what they've entered into right now is flailing hitting us with the corona virus
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:01.440]  obviously a chinese weapon uh hitting us with the islamic invasion hitting us with the culture
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:07.440]  wars hollywood trying to sort of race war so i've never been to c pack and i've been to the rnc
[2:35:07.440 --> 2:35:13.600]  and things and i know that there's neocons there that want to get us banned and so i told the crew
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:19.920]  i said follow all the rules to a t and even if people screaming you and yell at you put up with
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:23.600]  it and they said they wanted to kill me and people come up and yell at me and then you know they do
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:27.920]  it to gab mcgannis who's a good guy but then he'd say f you back to him and they would go tattle
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:33.600]  and then they'd be thrown out so i was in there got mobbed ran into the russian president's son
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:37.680]  going to interview him the president all of it was really excited and owen and the whole crew
[2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:43.680]  did a really good job and i flew out friday they were gonna stay through saturday when the president
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:50.480]  came and i see owen up there saying i don't know why i'm being thrown out of c pack and then it
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:54.240]  becomes a big story and and i'm like you know i don't want to make it about how we're being thrown
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:57.920]  out of there and then owen didn't call me we didn't talk to the yesterday and i found out how he got
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:04.960]  thrown out and then it was a story it was like oh and incidentally uh gorka was going around
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:10.960]  pointing at people he wanted thrown out like he was god and we're going to talk about um
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:19.520]  the little crab from the little mermaid to bastion i love tyranny baby whale gorka because
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:27.040]  it's not about gorka who's a nobody wasn't even conservative came into the trump administration
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.840]  with fraudulent credentials lied that he was a combat veteran none of that was true he's stolen
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:38.160]  glory hey he's the snake well salesman he's everything he says we are but i learned the day
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:44.080]  i was there that gorka was going around having people thrown out i just go whatever don't engage
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:47.840]  don't engage the gay wells when i call him i'm not saying he's actually gay but he's very effeminate
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:52.240]  in these pictures with guns posing with him and you know he's always sashaying around shaking
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:58.640]  his booty gorka so i'm just like you know the gay well then the dude acts like a flamer nothing
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:03.280]  it's flamers he just if i was going to cast a fat gated for a movie it'd be gorka who thinks
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:08.080]  it's james bond and so gorka the gay well as i call him the with the tyrant loving the nazi
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:14.640]  whale is a better name i found out cuz oh and was from a little yeah gorka saw him and you know
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:19.600]  went and did something so harris and smith went and talked to him the next day and gorka says yeah
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:26.240]  you shouldn't be here because you sell supplements well gorka is on tv selling supplements that
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:31.200]  actually don't look that bad but the point is man we don't sell out now pain relief supplements
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:35.520]  i mean you're starting to get into snake oil area there when you're making those claims show i just
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:40.240]  let you get things like tumor and see what it does show what's crazy is if i was like a supplement
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:44.960]  seller which i am which i know is quality i go that piece of filled cell supplements the insult
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:51.120]  to the audience to his own people that he's a known supplement seller but if we sell them we're bad
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:57.600]  bad that shows he hates his audience and so that's why this is important and i'm gonna say this now
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:02.640]  and go to you guys and we'll play the the video compilation next segment of what happened what
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:08.560]  you guys did versus what he said you did is that this guy comes in he gets taken out of the administration
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:14.240]  because he's not who he says he is he suddenly's all over fox news everywhere because they know
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:21.760]  they control him he's a covert never trumpet in my view and he's the example of what we face of
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:27.440]  these interlopers that just come into america and then want to badmouth the real grassroots groups
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:35.040]  that got trump elected and you can tell with the insider neocons that run c-pack he was like the
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:40.720]  top field marshal and we watched it we saw it happen so the worst elements of the republican
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:48.960]  party think gorka the tyrant whale is what they want that he gorka doesn't matter gorka's a joke
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:53.840]  people hate his guts online but he's always running around supporting censorship so this is the never
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:39:00.560]  trump or neocons Shapiro you know type wing of this but we went to see pack we were nice the
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:07.040]  guys got thrown out for no reason and gorka is the one police dogging it and and so trump is up
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:12.240]  there when the ice skating group comes out and supports the president from the 80s they go oh
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:19.120]  how dare you support him or any any group well he likes you know mustang so he's a good guy when
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:29.200]  when when any of this is going on it's supposedly a a great thing so what i'm trying to get at here
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:35.680]  is is that the reason this is important is trump broke through the criticism the attacks the black
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:40.640]  balling but the democrats in the deep state use it on everybody else so the republican establishment
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:45.680]  knows keep alex jones and the populace movement and the liberty movement that got from elected out
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:51.120]  don't let them take the party completely over and put people like gorka as the police dogs not
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:56.800]  even american in there hovering around literally spouting and pontificating in an arrogant way
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:01.280]  you guys go ahead and take over well no i think you're exactly right and the the real stark difference
[2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:05.600]  is like the list between people who have a problem with us and the people who love us and like us
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:10.720]  and appreciate what we do because on one side you got what gorka maybe charlie kirch is not so
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:15.440]  favorable and the leadership of cpaq that's three people on the other side i mean it just we were
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:19.840]  mobbed everywhere oh my god everybody you know they hate their own supporters yeah everybody they're
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:25.120]  there to control those people and come be told how to be conservative by us and there's gorka the
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:31.120]  whale the tyrant whale you know the big candy ass shashing around like liberace telling us
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:35.040]  how to be good americans well and here's the other thing if you look at gorka's subscribers
[2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:40.240]  on youtube somebody sent me the screenshot he's dropping 50 subscribers a day until our video
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:44.400]  releases and suddenly it drops by several thousand i mean people did not like this i had people coming
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:48.240]  up to me for the rest of the trip after that video dropped coming up to me and saying we don't know
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:52.320]  what the hell's gork gorka by the way he's almost as creepy as ron stelter let's put his eyes back
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:58.320]  up on screen yeah and i mean gorka the gorka the pervert i mean excuse me the political pervert
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:03.520]  whale prefer to do attack from as big as supporters there he is look at those eyes man now he's gonna
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:09.520]  run your life he is gorka yeah that was the look and when i approached him i mean he's he is really
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:13.520]  intent on reading where i'm from and as soon as he sees info wars that's when he goes off and you
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:18.960]  can see in the full video i walk up to him i'm just smiling and i don't say a thing to him i say hi
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:24.160]  and then he just goes off i mean it was we weren't pestering him because he's a stolen valour frog
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:27.920]  yeah well and he's and he's threatened and you know it's like uh rob douce tweet put out you know you
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:32.000]  go to c pack and you're mobbed by everybody everybody who's anybody everybody who's nobody
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:35.600]  i'm just a regular info warriors out there that we meet that just say we really appreciate what you
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:40.400]  do everywhere they're everywhere but gorka the effeminate whale is not popular but he's the
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:44.080]  important one right it's the people at the top who have a problem with us and and they're the ones
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:48.480]  that matter apparently because he shashes around again we're not trying to get cool at the high
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.200]  school that is c pack we went to see the nature of the nebert trumpers and what they're doing and
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:58.640]  sure enough they they they came to the you know they came up like barracudas after their praise
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:03.040]  so and sure when we come back we'll get into this but briefly um i don't the distraction of infight
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:07.120]  this isn't infighting these aren't republicans these aren't patriots these aren't trumpers these
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:12.880]  are people that want to control and hijack the movement well i just think it's sad that the
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:18.880]  people who have the most skin in the game when it comes to trump and what came to the 2016 election
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:24.480]  and what's happened since moving into 2020 they just don't they don't want to give us any credit
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:28.960]  or they want to try to slide us or any of this stuff and again we don't because they want to hijack
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:33.200]  the movement they hate trump people i i think it's that they've just been phonies their whole
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:37.280]  careers they've gotten rich off being phonies faking being conservatives or whatever and they
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:41.440]  know that when a real conservative or a real patriot steps in front of them that's basically
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:45.600]  kryptonite to their to their phony patriotism that they've gotten rich off of they're really just
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:51.760]  grifters just an industrial level grifters that's a good way to describe it he is the tyrant
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:58.320]  tyton of tyranny i also want to say that i'm happy to be uh uh helping out with an enterprise that
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:04.160]  is supported by all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving into sickness
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:08.240]  care take care of their health take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:13.520]  vitality and i say that from personal experience because i know that the products that are being
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:18.320]  offered here i've tried them and i i use them every day and that power pack that they have the
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:24.880]  ampm power pack well i wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that i have been on a regular
[2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:28.960]  customer in that regard i just wanted to start out by saying that because i think it's important
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:33.760]  to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think
[2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:39.440]  about these great events in the world one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:46.480]  remembering that our lives are a gift from god that he intends us to use for good purpose for our
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:51.680]  families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think like we do are
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:56.880]  critical to the future of america it's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:44:02.160]  preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales not just here but across the world
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:08.560]  that's good people need to be self-sufficient the average person is living hand to mouth

[2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:50.400]  i say i don't want to get into infighting and then when i start looking at gorka the demonic
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:55.760]  whale and just everything about him it's just it's everything we hate he'll he's he's a glenbeck
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:01.040]  want to be 2.0 glenbeck now endorses trump and has tried to resuscitate himself and tells people
[2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:05.040]  privately that he was wrong and thought ten crews would win and it was all him a political
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.840]  calculation well you lost if you just would have nicely opposed trump would have been fine but
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:16.320]  instead you tried your messiah thing and your religious leader and you know all the rest of it
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:22.800]  but again you always know who the controllers up top like they like sycophants reportedly gorka
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:28.720]  has a rest uh you know case and rest history uh in hungary talks like this if there's nothing
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:35.440]  wrong with talking in the good eastern european dialect but this is how he talks yeah you will
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:42.160]  serve us well american pig but he's got his good fake british accent so he's not even he's not even
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:48.320]  a red cup okay you have to understand he's just another fake industrial level con artist as you
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:53.840]  said so i want to get past him that we're going to play a clip in a moment and just say trump won
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:57.840]  because he didn't care about the attacks he broke through they tried to ostracize him they tried
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:03.680]  to isolate him that it doesn't work and then when people double down on people they support me at
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:09.120]  info wars or trump or any other or brexit they said they were all nazis then it becomes even more
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:15.840]  successful and i know as an audience of activists you get that but so many other people even family
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:21.360]  i have they come up and they go i'll be at a birthday party or family reunion they're all
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:26.880]  pray for you how how you taking it under the attack i'm like man this is awesome the enemies of humanity
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:31.920]  the child molesting globalist attack me every day and on new year's eve i was on every channel as
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:38.000]  the number one devil uh just at the end of the year i mean that means i'm over the target this
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:45.120]  is awesome again it's like asking somebody flying over you know uh tokyo dropping bombs on a world
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:48.320]  war two you're getting shot at how are you taking it but i signed up for this i'm kicking ass i'm not
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:55.760]  comparing myself to that it's just it's an attitude it's an attitude and and they want to get you
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:00.320]  know this attitude of oh you don't want to get criticized it's all a bluff hollywood is all over
[2:50:00.320 --> 2:50:07.040]  the news now at drag queen story times humping the children and they're going to stick it in folks
[2:50:07.040 --> 2:50:11.840]  because it's their religion they have to push it and then the average person goes well they're
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:16.000]  they pass the law you can give people hiv in california the same guy reduced to bill the senator
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:22.320]  that you can if it's gay sex with a little boy it's okay it's just if you know if you have
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:27.200]  sexual girl it's not or it's a woman raping little girl it's okay these people aren't going to stop
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:33.040]  so we might as well just start saying no to them comments on that guys yeah well you know i was
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:37.920]  i want to ask like was is this what 2016 was like because i wasn't here in 2016 i came here in 2017
[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:42.800]  since 2020 started it has been the most exciting like exhilarating i'm more exhausted than i've
[2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:46.880]  ever been but i'm more like fulfilled than i've ever been and it's the election year like it's
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:51.600]  all coming together they're more desperate than ever and uh it's you know but it makes you want
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:56.880]  to fight oh and you were here in 2016 what was it like or just starting to join us well it was
[2:50:56.880 --> 2:51:01.680]  still different back then because you didn't have all of the trump hate from the left that you did
[2:51:01.680 --> 2:51:06.320]  now they still kind of acted like he wasn't a real candidate so so that hillary had 98 chance to do
[2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:12.080]  our times yeah that's kind of a new phenomenon uh but then culturally you know it was kind of really
[2:51:12.080 --> 2:51:18.080]  the onset of the drag queen story time and it's gone so full throttle now we've exposed drag queen
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:24.560]  story times being infiltrated by known sex offenders course we've seen the videos of drag queen story
[2:51:24.560 --> 2:51:30.240]  time drag queen story time is a grooming sex offender orgy with children and so it's just gotten
[2:51:30.240 --> 2:51:36.640]  worse meet a pedophile time here's a here's one that's gonna be a pervert right now little girl's
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:41.680]  not happy but i don't think that it's taking his ass in a five-year-old's face mommy thinks it's
[2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:48.080]  trendy because mommy's sick it's a weird thing though i think that this is almost a counterbalance
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:53.600]  to the majority of americans and culture actually becoming more moral and getting back to having a
[2:51:53.600 --> 2:52:00.080]  moral conscious and compass i mean this is a giant big black dude dressed like a woman almost naked
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:04.720]  fondling and shaking his ass a little girl's face who's scared i mean i wouldn't want to be a part of
[2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:10.720]  this if it was you know uh say a supermodel i'm not into this type of degeneracy uh you know
[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:14.480]  though so the fact that they're doing this well i don't like i don't like topless bars i think
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:17.600]  people that are in them i just don't want to go to it because the woman's not really into me it's
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:21.840]  fake right and so that's what i'm saying but but now this is all about shaking your ass and little
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:26.960]  kid's faces and being deviant well and it's not they try to tie it into the transgenderism things
[2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:30.560]  they can bring in the psychology and say well some people's brains but drag queens they don't think
[2:52:30.560 --> 2:52:34.880]  that they're women right that's a sexual stuff like a woman is comedy in front of adults saying
[2:52:34.880 --> 2:52:39.520]  jokes because it's stupid he's an old man shaking your ass in front of kids is pedophilia but but
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:44.080]  let's just go further i didn't mean to rat rabbit trellis you guys are nice following my lead let's
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:51.280]  get back to trump broke the mold by not caring we broke the mold by not caring and people i need
[2:52:51.280 --> 2:52:55.840]  to understand that people republican party aren't leaders that's why they're still so scared of media
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:53:00.080]  because they're on average 80 years old nothing against 80 year olds we're the future and so how
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:06.080]  do we telegraph it how did gorka have so much power to go you're out you're out you're out because
[2:53:06.080 --> 2:53:10.320]  he goes and kisses ass the head of cpaq and it's his idea that he can run all the real
[2:53:10.320 --> 2:53:16.800]  conservatives off he can then perch up there no gorka everyone hates you now when you pose with
[2:53:16.800 --> 2:53:23.120]  guns everybody knows you don't know which end the bullet comes out of yeah that gorka's a big guy
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:27.760]  i challenge him to a charity marriage michael's boxing match he'll raise i'm serious they'll
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:32.960]  have it in vegas i will get in that ring and i will beat his brains out to sign the form you big
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:38.400]  fat tough guy bully and i'll smash your freaking head and let's go let's go let's go
[2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:44.640]  punk there's nothing but a piece of crap oh and you want to take him on i got to get around her
[2:53:44.640 --> 2:53:48.640]  too but i might but you got your cardiovascular going you want to challenge him you want to
[2:53:48.640 --> 2:53:52.640]  challenge gorka to a charity boxing match because he's so big and powerful and he wants to get in
[2:53:52.640 --> 2:53:58.880]  the ring with kooks let's let's see what gorka had to say what why what what what does gorka think
[2:53:58.880 --> 2:54:03.120]  about info yeah let's play let's play the report that shows the whale attack you show what was really
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:07.520]  happening and then we show him he says selling supplements of snake oil he's a huge supplement
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:14.000]  seller so again the he thinks the audience his supporters have no imagine all in there and said
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:19.520]  people that sell supplements are scum the listeners would go what the hell what what do you think
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:25.360]  what i mean he just he again he has that disdain for people yeah that that that inbred want to be
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:31.280]  elitism but he's so dumb he thinks attacking the main grassroots engine of trump will get him ahead
[2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:37.840]  because all he wants to do is grovel to the power structure so he can waddle around you know
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:43.200]  and order people around we're already don't have time to go the report but here it is
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:51.040]  go away all right you guys are kooks you're crazy kooks and conspiracy theories go away
[2:54:51.040 --> 2:54:56.080]  why should we so we shouldn't be allowed to be here um people this is for real conservatives
[2:54:56.640 --> 2:55:02.320]  not people who are snake oil merchants and conspiracy theories like so bashing gorka
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:08.240]  here for relief factor and first of all let me say that i have never before endorsed a pain reliever
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:13.440]  but when pete and saith talbot the father-son owners of relief factor asked me to endorse their 100
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:20.400]  percent drug-free product i absolutely couldn't say no this is for real conservatives not people
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:27.840]  who are snake oil merchants and conspiracy theorists like you and you hear that fake british voice
[2:55:27.840 --> 2:55:35.680]  oh and warrior here from info wars dot com and i am entering c pack 2020 a la donald trump
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:40.080]  what can i say i felt like it mike menlindel from my poll you're more than a pillar salesman
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:45.120]  you're an inspiration now mike you're an inspiration thank you thank you mike mike lindel everybody
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:52.160]  this is one of the reasons why the internet is as great as it is that social media is as great as
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:58.160]  it is is not because of government intervention it's not because you know he's not gonna if you
[2:55:58.160 --> 2:56:02.560]  go if you get something with me i want to get in the ring with him less he was assuming trump wins
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:07.520]  in 2020 i think we both agree i think that that's where this goes what do you think the left does
[2:56:07.520 --> 2:56:36.800]  it get more violent do they call down what are you gonna have it it's only gonna get worse from gorka they can't comprehend that this guy that's not with the programming is is doing so well for america they just can't they don't understand my name is jason roe burge i'm running in the seventh congressional district and uh our campaign is focused on a number of issues but the gun grabbing issue let's just talk about that the governor wants to take away our assault weapons and whatever they call it oh and did the rifles he did a great job when he come back and we'll go to your phone calls i'll show you the exciting
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:45.360]  conclusion when the whale season and and again people confirmed the whale would go around and order people thrown out the left to
[2:56:46.240 --> 2:56:52.320]  would go up and threaten people and then they would run back and tell you they're like oh my god you're with bus fee and and like c pack would just go
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:57:00.560]  because the republican party is still really democrat party operatives but the good news is that's all falling apart now remember

[3:20:22.440 --> 3:20:36.440]  Before we do the balance of transmission I'm going to take your phone calls and have two of these great co-hosts here riding shotgun with me riff off of that. Let's move now or I'll never get to you. Tammy in Idaho thanks for holding your own the year. Go ahead.
[3:20:36.440 --> 3:20:50.440]  Hi Alex. I'm really nervous but what I want to talk about is behind the scenes as far as the invasion of Europe. There's a lot of background of banking manipulation.
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:55.440]  Oh boy tell me about banking manipulation if you only knew.
[3:20:55.440 --> 3:21:11.440]  It is somebody named Nurtan Erdogan and that's spelled N-U-R-T-E-N-E-R-D-O-G-A-N and I think it's a she and she's an official with Deutsche Bundesbank.
[3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:20.440]  Keeping in mind that Angela Merkel is on the dark side that she is evil and she encouraged some of this invasion of Europe.
[3:21:20.440 --> 3:21:26.440]  Angela Merkel they call her mama. She said invade us. We are bad. So is the Pope.
[3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:44.440]  The Turkish finance minister had even proposed buying Deutsche Bundesbank and also Erdogan was trying to take over the largest private bank in Turkey.
[3:21:44.440 --> 3:21:48.440]  Erdogan said five years ago you're going to allow a Turkish party in every country.
[3:21:48.440 --> 3:21:56.440]  When you got like 20 parties in each country even a party that gets like 6-7% of the Muslims voting can then throw a country whichever way they want with the other parties.
[3:21:56.440 --> 3:22:08.440]  So yeah there's an attempted political economic takeover by Islam with allied criminals inside the German government and Germany is just like in World War II making a deal with the Muslims and it's disgusting.
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:13.440]  Well no I would say it goes one step further than that.
[3:22:13.440 --> 3:22:19.440]  The international banking complex is centered out of the city of London.
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:29.440]  And as I think you've pointed out before you have to keep in mind the big picture that the city of London bankers orchestrate every war.
[3:22:29.440 --> 3:22:35.440]  They orchestrated World War I. They orchestrated World War II.
[3:22:35.440 --> 3:22:41.440]  The international bankers out of London actually set up 9-11.
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:44.440]  Well I mean obviously the city of London within London is really evil.
[3:22:44.440 --> 3:22:45.440]  The Rothschilds are involved in a lot of stuff.
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:49.440]  Yeah but you know Frankfurt's very powerful as a banking center as well.
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:53.440]  So you know this whole axis but I agree the leftists are unified behind Islam.
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:54.440]  I appreciate your call.
[3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:54.440]  Thank you.
[3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:56.440]  You guys want to comment on what Tammy had to say.
[3:22:56.440 --> 3:22:58.440]  I think she's exactly right.
[3:22:58.440 --> 3:22:59.440]  You gotta pay attention where the money is.
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:07.440]  I think that every war I mean this is something that we all agree we want to see come to an end is endless wars and it's always the same thing.
[3:23:07.440 --> 3:23:12.440]  Like she said banking it seems no side.
[3:23:12.440 --> 3:23:14.440]  They just get rich off of it no matter what.
[3:23:14.440 --> 3:23:20.440]  They'll do international banking deals and fun deals and fund all different armies one side of the world to the other.
[3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:21.440]  It doesn't matter who's fighting.
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:22.440]  It doesn't matter when.
[3:23:22.440 --> 3:23:25.440]  So there's definitely I mean Smedley Butler wrote the book in 1942.
[3:23:25.440 --> 3:23:28.440]  War is a racket a famous war general.
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:36.440]  So when you get to the root of the issues I think that there is a debate on where do you go from the central bankers.
[3:23:36.440 --> 3:23:40.440]  Where do you go from the international bankers but it's well documented throughout history.
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:44.440]  They have been one of the main perpetrators of war as Tammy just pointed out.
[3:23:44.440 --> 3:23:46.440]  And that's financing both sides.
[3:23:46.440 --> 3:23:50.440]  So you should end up being a winner regardless because the other side has to pay reparations.
[3:23:50.440 --> 3:23:51.440]  This is bigger.
[3:23:51.440 --> 3:23:53.440]  This is a cultural worldwide takeover.
[3:23:53.440 --> 3:24:01.440]  Islamics have like five plus children on average five point whatever it is and that's the demographic takeover.
[3:24:01.440 --> 3:24:03.440]  So Islam is going to be the global enforcer.
[3:24:03.440 --> 3:24:06.440]  Well and politically the Democrats figured this out.
[3:24:06.440 --> 3:24:08.440]  This is how Ilhan Omar Rashida Tlaib get into office.
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:14.440]  If you actually go look at Islamic voter turnout in Michigan and Minnesota it's in the 90 percentile.
[3:24:14.440 --> 3:24:19.440]  There is not another demographic group that even comes close to that.
[3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:22.440]  You're lucky if you can get to 70 percent in any other demographic group.
[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:27.440]  Muslims are politically active and a lot of them come from countries where they know they weren't free.
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:36.440]  So they still have that instinct to go and be politically active to get things done because that's something new to them that they still don't take for granted.
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:37.440]  Well said.
[3:24:37.440 --> 3:24:44.440]  Yeah and I mean look at what Erdogan has done over the last couple of years in Turkey's consolidated his power to an incredible degree.
[3:24:44.440 --> 3:24:49.440]  Of course Turkey the modern Turkey funded by Ataturk following World War One the fall of the Ottoman Empire.
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:55.440]  Founded specifically to be non-political with the army sort of guaranteeing that as a non-political actor.
[3:24:55.440 --> 3:25:02.440]  And Erdogan has systematically taken down those controls taken down those limitations to really be fully fledged Islam.
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:03.440]  Preparing for a total jihad.
[3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:09.440]  Yeah to become you know an emir as they call it you know the Islamic leader and forming a caliphate.
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:14.440]  I did a report called you know Turkey is now an Islamic caliphate in all but name because it essentially is.
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:15.440]  It's excellent.
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:16.440]  It's excellent.
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:19.440]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Paul in Canada.
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:22.440]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:25.440]  Yeah Alex it's Paul here from Canada.
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:26.440]  Yes sir.
[3:25:26.440 --> 3:25:31.440]  I'm a Greek citizen as well.
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:32.440]  I live in Canada.
[3:25:32.440 --> 3:25:33.440]  So I do.
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:39.440]  I'm familiar with what's going on there with the Islamic invasion going on.
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:43.440]  I'll tell you this the people in Greece are fed up.
[3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:45.440]  They need support.
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:54.440]  And unfortunately you know the other European countries have been somewhat trying to help out but they're they're bombarded over there.
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:25:55.440]  Right.
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:25:58.440]  And well you got military men pouring in and mass mowing down.
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:25:59.440]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:00.440]  That's what borders are.
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:04.440]  Try to cross the Russian border of the future as we used to do that here.
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:06.440]  So a bunch of people try to run over your border.
[3:26:06.440 --> 3:26:07.440]  Kill them.
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:08.440]  Absolutely.
[3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:09.440]  Absolutely.
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:10.440]  I totally support that.
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:12.440]  I mean you know there's one thing I'm going to try that tough here either.
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:14.440]  That's just what this is how the world works.
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:16.440]  All these libertarians which I go oh we don't need a government.
[3:26:16.440 --> 3:26:17.440]  Yeah.
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:22.440]  Once we have freedom worldwide and some semblance of a system you can you can have government go away to a certain extent.
[3:26:22.440 --> 3:26:24.440]  But other governments organize and attack you.
[3:26:24.440 --> 3:26:26.440]  You've got to have a structure to counter that.
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:27.440]  Sorry.
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:28.440]  Go ahead.
[3:26:28.440 --> 3:26:29.440]  Yeah.
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:30.440]  We have one thing in Greece.
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:31.440]  We say.
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:44.440]  And the Greek flag.
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:47.440]  And the symbolism of the cross for our.
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:56.440]  I'll add right on that because I knew Patrick Henry and everybody got liberty or death comes out of the Greek saying so say that again in Greek.
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:26:57.440]  And that's what that means.
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:26:59.440]  Freedom or death.
[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:01.440]  And so.
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:02.440]  Especially the younger generation.
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:04.440]  I mean I did military in Greece.
[3:27:04.440 --> 3:27:06.440]  And the Greek military.
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:09.440]  The people that are there they understand what's going on.
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:13.440]  A lot of people there are info wars listeners as well.
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:15.440]  The younger generation there.
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:17.440]  So they're they're awake.
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:19.440]  They're awake and they know what's going on.
[3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:22.440]  But they just need that support that extra support.
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:24.440]  I think Bulgaria came in.
[3:27:24.440 --> 3:27:28.440]  This week and said they were going to support them militarily.
[3:27:28.440 --> 3:27:29.440]  Let's hope that.
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:32.440]  And by the way don't let the Patriots get thrown out like Italy.
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:34.440]  This is this is a globalist attack.
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:40.440]  You need the Greek military and the people to arrest the communist heads and the Soros people and throw their asses out of the country.
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:41.440]  You're under a military attack.
[3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:45.440]  You need to arrest the opposition that are globalists and say you shouldn't exist.
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:46.440]  And we should too.
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:48.440]  People that say the country shouldn't exist.
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:49.440]  They call for violence.
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:50.440]  They're not citizens.
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:53.440]  They're enemies opening the drawbridge period.
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:27:54.440]  That's not a radical statement.
[3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:56.440]  We need to start saying the truth here.
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:57.440]  What do you think should happen.
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:03.440]  Well, I mean, you know, we got our right wing politician in there right now.
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:07.440]  No, but I'm saying they're going to send in foreign money and corruption and take them out.
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:11.440]  I'm saying countries like Italy had a chance and they got you.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:16.440]  You've got to nip the Soros money like Russia and Hungary and Romania have done.
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:18.440]  You've got to cut the head off.
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:19.440]  Yeah.
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:24.440]  And that's the problem is that, you know, there's so much corruption there just like in a lot of European countries.
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:29.440]  And, you know, we're just trying to figure out where we're going to cut that off.
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:31.440]  And you're absolutely right, Alex.
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:33.440]  We have to do something because.
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:34.440]  Sure.
[3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:38.440]  This is a probe and the media is going to say your police are bad for halfway defending your border.
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:42.440]  Then they're going to flood money into overthrow, put a commie in and just flood your ass.
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:43.440]  Exactly.
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:45.440]  And, you know, it's already bad as it is.
[3:28:45.440 --> 3:28:47.440]  I mean, there's migrants running around.
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:48.440]  No, I agree.
[3:28:48.440 --> 3:28:49.440]  So the Greeks just need to take the gloves off.
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:51.440]  Just take the gloves off like the Poles do.

[3:29:59.440 --> 3:30:01.440]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy.
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:02.440]  They're trying to start wars.
[3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:03.440]  They're trying to overthrow the president.
[3:30:03.440 --> 3:30:05.440]  They're trying to silence free speech.
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:09.440]  They're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[3:30:09.440 --> 3:30:19.440]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[3:30:54.440 --> 3:30:55.440]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[3:30:55.440 --> 3:30:56.440]  And I love Trump all day long.
[3:30:56.440 --> 3:31:01.440]  But man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over everybody.
[3:31:01.440 --> 3:31:03.440]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[3:31:03.440 --> 3:31:05.440]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:08.440]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[3:31:08.440 --> 3:31:19.440]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowarstore.com.
[3:31:19.440 --> 3:31:20.440]  And it looks like duct tape.
[3:31:20.440 --> 3:31:21.440]  It's just a regular sticker.
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:26.440]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[3:31:26.440 --> 3:31:27.440]  People say, why are you doing this?
[3:31:27.440 --> 3:31:28.440]  What's happening?
[3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:30.440]  When you go, well, we're being censored.
[3:31:30.440 --> 3:31:32.440]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[3:31:32.440 --> 3:31:35.440]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:36.440]  It's brilliant.
[3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:43.440]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:46.440]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[3:31:46.440 --> 3:31:48.440]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[3:31:48.440 --> 3:31:49.440]  Silence.
[3:31:49.440 --> 3:31:52.440]  Silence.
[3:31:52.440 --> 3:31:54.440]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[3:31:54.440 --> 3:32:04.440]  Coronavirus is a man-made bio-weapon designed to destroy nation-states, economies, and free peoples, and usher in, a planetary government.
[3:32:04.440 --> 3:32:06.440]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[3:32:06.440 --> 3:32:08.440]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[3:32:08.440 --> 3:32:18.440]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home, and that's just in one nation.
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:27.440]  Coronavirus deals a major blow to German car factories in China, that reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[3:32:27.440 --> 3:32:30.440]  That's how major this is.
[3:32:30.440 --> 3:32:33.440]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[3:32:33.440 --> 3:32:36.440]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[3:32:36.440 --> 3:32:45.440]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[3:32:45.440 --> 3:32:51.440]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band.video and infowars.com today.
[3:33:15.440 --> 3:33:16.440]  I love good.
[3:33:16.440 --> 3:33:45.440]  He said me well.
[3:33:46.440 --> 3:33:53.440]  We need to make a music video out of this.
[3:33:53.440 --> 3:33:54.440]  What amazing colors.
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:33:55.440]  I say I don't disrespect them.
[3:33:55.440 --> 3:33:57.440]  We got a bunch of gas, a bunch of brakes.
[3:33:57.440 --> 3:33:59.440]  We got like 20 phone lines, and we got to a lot of them.
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:01.440]  That guy was in the Greek military before.
[3:34:01.440 --> 3:34:02.440]  He lives in Canada.
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:05.440]  I'm not trying to sit up here and sound tough.
[3:34:05.440 --> 3:34:07.440]  I'm like, kill them.
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:12.440]  Dude, there's 1.9 billion Muslims, a major country.
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:23.440]  Probably the third biggest military in Europe just launched attacks where they put kids in fires to make them cry for the news media to blame the Greeks that are being overrun.
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:29.440]  I mean, I see this and I just instinctively, it's a good thing I'm not in the police or military.
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:35.440]  Dude, I saw somebody 100 yards over putting kids in fires to then have them crying and screaming in front of the news cameras and blaming me.
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:38.440]  I mean, the officers told me don't do anything.
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:44.440]  Well, it didn't matter because I would just get into politics, take the government over, but I mean, I'd be commanding this thing or at least I'd be trying.
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:48.440]  I mean, what the hell is going on here?
[3:34:48.440 --> 3:34:50.440]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:52.440]  We're going to go right back to calls.
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:54.440]  You guys want to fill people in at their radio listeners?
[3:34:54.440 --> 3:34:55.440]  They can't see the video.
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:34:56.440]  It's up on infowars.com.
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:35:00.440]  The great Gregory said a report on it, three minute report.
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:06.440]  They're torturing children as human shields to blame the Greek military.
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:14.440]  Oh, it's just this insane brave new world of manufactured reality where instead of just armies marching in and formation and doing battle and trying to overcome each other,
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:18.440]  they actually have to make themselves seem weak so they can be portrayed.
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:26.440]  Yeah, the Muslims have been trying to take over Greece and have many times for over a thousand years and now they just bring their kids into battle saying don't attack me.
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:27.440]  I got a kid in my arms.
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:28.440]  You can go a thousand years back.
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:33.440]  You can go 3,000 years back to the hot gates in Thermopylae and trying to stop the Persians.
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:34.440]  I was saying it last time.
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:36.440]  The Greeks have saved the West before.
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:37.440]  They can do it again.
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:39.440]  Well, the Serbs did it almost as much as the Greeks.
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:44.440]  So we bombed the living hell out of them to let Albania take over one-third of Serbia.
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:48.440]  I mean, this is an epic battle, a battle of epics, I should say.
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:52.440]  By the way, I'm not some Serb phobe.
[3:35:52.440 --> 3:35:58.440]  They admit the Muslims attacked Serbia for 10 years before the Serbs mobilized and started kicking their ass.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:05.440]  And then the US military bombed them and gave a third of Serbia to the Albanian Muslims.
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:08.440]  What the hell?
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  Well, it's this weird thing too where they've been victims of fake news so much.
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:14.440]  Now they just know how to manipulate it.
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:24.440]  So they know, oh, we can go create this video, whether it's the white helmets faking, you know, kids being in explosions or this latest one, or people being dead under a cloth and they're laughing and joking.
[3:36:24.440 --> 3:36:26.440]  They know how to manipulate the fake news.
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:29.440]  They've seen it so many times, manipulated against them.
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:34.440]  Now they're just doing it and they feel absolutely zero guilt, zero responsibility.
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:37.440]  In fact, they feel it's their responsibility to do just that.
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:43.440]  And now because of the internet, we're able to kind of see through this process, not just what happens in the Middle East.
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:46.440]  And that's why they want to get rid of it, but you're never going to be able to cover this up.
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:53.440]  Well, and again, we're now just starting to learn en masse this process of what happens with fake news internationally.
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:55.440]  How could a mother put her kid in a fire like that?
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:36:58.440]  I just look at that woman as a cockroach.
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:00.440]  Well, this is what we're dealing with.
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:02.440]  This is what fake news is going to do.
[3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:04.440]  They're going to, they're going to pretend something.
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:05.440]  Now they run across.
[3:37:05.440 --> 3:37:06.440]  Oh, those people, man.
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:08.440]  They play, you know, you, you will come here.
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:11.440]  We got to kiss their ass to give them welfare.
[3:37:11.440 --> 3:37:12.440]  Oh, please.
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:14.440]  The babies and incubators.
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:17.440]  It was like the Kentucky gun firing range they cleaned with Syria.
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:18.440]  I mean, the list goes on.
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:19.440]  Small.
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:20.440]  Yeah.
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:23.440]  So don't question it or George Soros and Bloomberg will file 50 lawsuits on your ass.
[3:37:23.440 --> 3:37:26.440]  Well, and that's what, that's what happens if you question it too.
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:29.440]  So that's where the real irony comes in.
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:30.440]  They're all laughing.
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:31.440]  It's all funny.
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:34.440]  I was going to cause that's where I get all these calls.
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:37.440]  Who's been holding out Brian and Washington DC.
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:38.440]  Thanks for holding.
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:39.440]  Go ahead.
[3:37:39.440 --> 3:37:40.440]  Thank you.
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:41.440]  Hey, Alex.
[3:37:41.440 --> 3:37:45.440]  I wanted to call in and get your opinion on.
[3:37:45.440 --> 3:37:46.440]  I don't know if you saw that.
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:53.440]  Secretary of Defense S first said that the Pentagon was going to be basically working
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:56.440]  with FEMA to contain any outbreaks of the Corona virus.
[3:37:56.440 --> 3:37:57.440]  Yeah, I saw that.
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:37:58.440]  We broke that four weeks ago.
[3:37:58.440 --> 3:38:01.440]  The Pentagon's running the whole deal of emergency centers all over the U.S.
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:06.440]  And I got contacted by a Lieutenant Colonel in army special operations that they,
[3:38:06.440 --> 3:38:07.440]  they're projecting 3 million dead.
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:08.440]  That's me.
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:10.440]  That's going to happen, but they're getting ready for 3 million dead.
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:13.440]  And then it just by the weirdest of things, this other Lieutenant Colonel,
[3:38:13.440 --> 3:38:15.440]  I know that just graduated a year ago.
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:17.440]  He was just over the house because he runs a private business.
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:20.440]  I'm not going to get into what it is, but it's just the thing you do at your house.
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:22.440]  And I'm like, I got to go to see you later.
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:25.440]  And like he's talking to my wife as he's calling up going, he says 3 million are probably going
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:26.440]  to die.
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:29.440]  And I'm like, okay, that's two kernels in two days.
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:31.440]  Lieutenant Colonel's, I better come tell folks.
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:33.440]  But yeah, that's definitely what they're being told.
[3:38:33.440 --> 3:38:35.440]  So I get why Trump's not hyping it.
[3:38:35.440 --> 3:38:37.440]  He doesn't want the stock market to crash.
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:39.440]  So he wants to just incrementally get us ready.
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:42.440]  So I would even call it a form of deception because we don't know how bad it will get.
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:47.440]  But the projections of 2% death rate with half the population infected with the projecting
[3:38:47.440 --> 3:38:50.440]  the next six months, that's 3 million plus dead.
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:51.440]  Yeah.
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:56.440]  And I mean, my mother works at the Pentagon and she was telling me that they had a three
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:39:03.440]  day training at the Pentagon regarding certain protocols that will be put into place if anybody
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:08.440]  in the building or if there was any series of outbreaks in DC.
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:13.440]  And what you know is going to happen.
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:14.440]  Huh?
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:15.440]  What you know is going to happen.
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:17.440]  I mean, I should have just done the whole show today on this.
[3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:18.440]  This is incredible.
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:19.440]  It's spreading everywhere.
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:21.440]  There's deaths all over the place.
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:24.440]  And I'm not trying to hype it that it's the end of the world.
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:26.440]  I'm just saying the hype from the beginning.
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:27.440]  This is a big plan.
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:28.440]  What do you got?
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:30.440]  Gut level on Troyer.
[3:39:30.440 --> 3:39:35.440]  What do you think that the Pentagon is canceling exercises around the world because of it?
[3:39:35.440 --> 3:39:38.440]  What do you think's really behind it just gut level?
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:44.440]  I think that there was some the real meat of this issue is in China.
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:49.440]  I think that whatever America has to deal with is going to really be more of a distraction
[3:39:49.440 --> 3:39:54.440]  or an attack, an attack campaign against the president, which we're already seeing.
[3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:56.440]  The real story here is in China.
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:39:57.440]  Where did this?
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:39:58.440]  How did it originate?
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:39:59.440]  How did it get there?
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:00.440]  And why?
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:01.440]  Or how did it get released?
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:05.440]  That's the good story and is China using this to round up political distance?
[3:40:05.440 --> 3:40:09.440]  Whatever happens in the West, you know, it'll mostly be under control.
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:10.440]  They're already pushing the vaccine.
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:14.440]  I'm not saying you should take it, but it'll probably be effective enough if it should break out.
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:16.440]  Again, I wouldn't take it.
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:22.440]  I trust my immune system to beat the coronavirus with the success rate that you have organically.
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:25.440]  I think that people are just looking at the worst saying if it spreads.
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  And who knows though?
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:30.440]  I mean, you've got, I forget the name of the doctor, Rod Rosenstein's sister at the CDC.
[3:40:30.440 --> 3:40:32.440]  She's the one causing a lot of this panic.
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:39.440]  How do we know there aren't deep state agents like that inside the WHO or the CDC that are intentionally letting it out?
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:40.440]  We know they did that.
[3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:41.440]  They allowed it in.
[3:40:41.440 --> 3:40:42.440]  They incubated it.
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:44.440]  Then they tell Trump everything's fine, sir.
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:47.440]  And then when it's not, it's credit scene, which we predicted and now they're trying it.
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:49.440]  But I don't think America is going to buy into that.
[3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:50.440]  Yeah.
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:57.440]  Well, I mean, we've been saying that this was most likely a bioweapon since sort of some of the facts first emerged because it was so obvious with the lab right there and everything.
[3:40:57.440 --> 3:41:02.440]  And then you have event 201 in October of 2019 where they predicted a coronavirus breaking out.
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:03.440]  They had all the numbers.
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:04.440]  Bill and Melinda Gates.
[3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:05.440]  Yep.
[3:41:05.440 --> 3:41:16.440]  Bill and Melinda Gates at the exact same time you had the UN in China doing these war games with China, a bunch of very strange behavior there all last year getting ready for this.
[3:41:16.440 --> 3:41:17.440]  Well said, Harrison Smith.
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:19.440]  Your channel is at Band-Aid video over the top.
[3:41:19.440 --> 3:41:20.440]  Important.
[3:41:20.440 --> 3:41:22.440]  Elena in New York.
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:23.440]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:24.440]  Elena.
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:25.440]  Hi.
[3:41:25.440 --> 3:41:27.440]  Hello, Alex.
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:28.440]  Thank you for taking my call.
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:33.440]  I was calling you for advice, but I'm really kind of cute, confused and blown away.
[3:41:33.440 --> 3:41:39.440]  I teach in New York concerns when I watched the president last Wednesday.
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:44.440]  I forwarded the links for K through 12 schools and childcare to my principal.
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:45.440]  I went to school.
[3:41:45.440 --> 3:41:48.440]  I shared with the kids even prior to that.
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:56.440]  I went six year old down to the nurse was coughing and a whole lot of mucus because they send the kids to school six.
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:41:57.440]  Staff is sick.
[3:41:57.440 --> 3:42:00.440]  It was my understanding that that shouldn't be happening.
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:02.440]  So Saturday I had a headache.
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:04.440]  I had I was sleeping.
[3:42:04.440 --> 3:42:09.440]  I was hoping I'd be well today, but this morning about three o'clock in the morning, I wasn't.
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:11.440]  So I did what I thought I was supposed to do.
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:12.440]  I called my doctor.
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  I went to the doctor here in New York and I'm told I can't have be checked for the Corona virus.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:21.440]  So that means doctors are not checking.
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:25.440]  My grandson goes to a Westchester public school in cold spring.
[3:42:25.440 --> 3:42:26.440]  I'm not sure if that's Westchester.
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:27.440]  Hold on, Elena.
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:29.440]  We're coming back to you in a couple of minutes.
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:33.440]  But this is the key and I'm not bragging as they say it's true.
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:36.440]  We first told you with Mike Adams and others that the kids were fake.
[3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:37.440]  They didn't work.
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:39.440]  They didn't have the reagent.
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:40.440]  That's now mainstream news today.
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:42.440]  And we told you they weren't testing.
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:43.440]  They're not.
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:46.440]  They're not sending out the coding, the labs that could do their own testing.
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:51.440]  There is a CDC cover up of the severity of this.
[3:42:51.440 --> 3:42:59.440]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:00.440]  That's good.
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:02.440]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:09.440]  The average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:13.440]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:20.440]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there that you only go to in emergencies.
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:26.440]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so.
[3:43:26.440 --> 3:43:34.440]  And things like DNA force plus that's now back in stock is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.

[3:45:51.440 --> 3:45:54.440]  Everybody needs food. I'm proud we're selling high quality food.
[3:45:54.440 --> 3:45:59.440]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble. This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:03.440]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:09.440]  And I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this.
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:12.440]  Right down to the folks who run the plants to get the best idea we have.
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:16.440]  But they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed.
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:22.440]  I understand the last food company, the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[3:46:22.440 --> 3:46:27.440]  And they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week.
[3:46:27.440 --> 3:46:31.440]  And at a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks.
[3:46:31.440 --> 3:46:35.440]  We don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:39.440]  Because we're honest, under promise, over deliver, but technically it's going to be six to eight weeks.
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:42.440]  And we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you.
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:46.440]  When you come back again, we want relationships with you. We're not Satanist. We're the opposite.
[3:46:46.440 --> 3:46:50.440]  We don't screw people over. We believe in Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you.
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:47:16.440]  We're all in this together.
[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:21.440]  I'm looking forward to it. My first day off and over.
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:24.440]  The whole audience heard it. Troyer's off today.
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:32.440]  Anyway, the point is, is that you ain't seen nothing yet, is that we're sitting here looking at all of this.
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:39.440]  We're talking in the break. The prescripting for the tabletop exercise of Bill and Linda Gates and Millions Dead and all of it.
[3:47:39.440 --> 3:47:43.440]  Whatever it is at stage, this is big.
[3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:47.440]  Let's go ahead and go to Elena in New York finishing up. Yes, ma'am.
[3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:53.440]  They're not testing people. They're covering it up so that Trump would then get bad numbers and say everything's fine.
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:58.440]  Now they're sending out the test this week to show a huge explosion and make Trump look bad.
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:02.440]  Trump's been set up. People are like, why are you putting Trump down?
[3:48:02.440 --> 3:48:08.440]  If my neighbor tells me that at Lawnmower Company scammers, my neighbor's a friend.
[3:48:08.440 --> 3:48:13.440]  Or if somebody tells me, hey, don't go to that restaurant. I got food poisoning. What are you doing? Tell me where to go eat dinner.
[3:48:13.440 --> 3:48:17.440]  We're not mad at Trump. He's walking into the trap.
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:21.440]  We're not running a cult, by the way. I want to finish it with Elena, but you guys got a quick comment on that?
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:27.440]  No, I think that's exactly right. We were saying during the break, when they make predictions, they're not making predictions.
[3:48:27.440 --> 3:48:32.440]  They're controlling much of this. We talked about it in 2001. They know very clearly.
[3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:35.440]  Their projections on the data they already have.
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:43.440]  And they'll use anything to make Trump look bad, even if that means a viral outbreak or making a viral outbreak.
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:45.440]  Well, we predicted they would do this.
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:48.440]  They're really easy to predict, sadly.
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:57.440]  But man, to blame something on the president like death and root for the economy implode, we could predict it because there's no bottom now.
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:48:59.440]  Do they not even know how bad that looks?
[3:48:59.440 --> 3:49:03.440]  You just think of what's the most evil thing you can imagine and they'll go one step farther.
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:08.440]  He just needs to commit to closing the border. I mean, that's the proper response to this, not to try to play ball with them.
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:11.440]  But Pat, you can and said it's just, oh, you said it all down.
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:15.440]  Exactly. Why wouldn't you not? They gave him a fastball right down the plate.
[3:49:15.440 --> 3:49:21.440]  They loaded the bases intentionally, gave him a fastball right down the plate, and he just chose to just watch it go up and strike one.
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:24.440]  It's like, so am I going to have to sit here and watch the guy when we could have a grand slam?
[3:49:24.440 --> 3:49:29.440]  Exactly. We're not attacking Trump. We're saying, hey, they're throwing fastball down the middle again, knock that thing out of the park.
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:34.440]  And we don't need to cheat to know that's what they're throwing. It's the same pitch every time.
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:38.440]  All he has to do is knock it out of the park and he can really deliver.
[3:49:38.440 --> 3:49:43.440]  And we already called the first pitch and you can see that the pitcher lining up with the same pitch.
[3:49:43.440 --> 3:49:44.440]  Yeah.
[3:49:44.440 --> 3:49:48.440]  And we're like, bring away, man. And he can blame it all on them.
[3:49:48.440 --> 3:49:53.440]  He can come out and say, I've seen that the media says that I've done a bad job at the Buddha.
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:50:01.440]  So we're going to go ahead and seal off the Buddha. Okay, that's the only option to get it out of control.
[3:50:01.440 --> 3:50:02.440]  It's a win-win.
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:03.440]  And then what are they going to do?
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:05.440]  Yeah, constitutionally put the military on it.
[3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:07.440]  Not play games, but the real deal.
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:09.440]  Okay, let's, Elena, thank you for holding.
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:14.440]  But what was your point about no one will test in New York? Yeah, that's in the news. Go ahead.
[3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:19.440]  No, the doctor wouldn't test in New York. So that's opposite to what I thought the CDC said.
[3:50:19.440 --> 3:50:25.440]  I thought I was being responsible as a teacher, staying home, going to my doctor, asking to be tested.
[3:50:25.440 --> 3:50:31.440]  So in a day or two, if I'm better, I need to go back and try to use the, use a mask while I'm teaching.
[3:50:31.440 --> 3:50:36.440]  So my doctor is looking into getting a letter, but I can be putting my job on the line.
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:40.440]  I have to look all these little three through 12 year olds in the eye.
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:43.440]  I don't have any, anything conclusive from.
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:49.440]  No, but you feel like you're being sucker-punched because you're seeing a lot of respiratory stuff, but no one will allow you to get tested.
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:51.440]  I hear you. It's not your fault. God bless you.
[3:50:51.440 --> 3:50:57.440]  But the fact is they sent out bad kids and they've been holding up the genetic coding to the places that have the kids or could make them.
[3:50:57.440 --> 3:51:00.440]  There's a cover-up. And the CHIComs involved themselves in the cover-up.
[3:51:00.440 --> 3:51:02.440]  So again, why are we following that?
[3:51:02.440 --> 3:51:08.440]  Okay, next up, Dave in Texas, the Darren Patrick. Go ahead, Dave, quickly. Thank you for holding.
[3:51:08.440 --> 3:51:14.440]  Hey, Alex. Great, great to see you. Talk to you. Thank you so much. I appreciate you.
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:20.440]  I've been sick since like December 27th. I was just curious how long is this stuff supposed to last?
[3:51:20.440 --> 3:51:30.440]  Hey, I was bragging, like I do, that I hadn't been sick in over four years and I went on a trip to Caribbean and I have had fevers off and on them and coughing for three, four weeks.
[3:51:30.440 --> 3:51:38.440]  So, yeah, what I mean, I talked to Steve Machetic and he's high hooked into all these guys. They say the virus is all over the place.
[3:51:38.440 --> 3:51:42.440]  And so that's what you're dealing with. The good news is, you know, a lot of folks are healthy and they're going to be able to fight it off.
[3:51:42.440 --> 3:51:46.440]  But when you get it, that's what they say. It keeps reinfecting. You just don't get rid of it.
[3:51:46.440 --> 3:51:52.440]  Right. Well, that's some of the genetic manipulation that they've found evidence of injecting things like HIV into the flu strain.
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:56.440]  I mean, all sorts of crazy stuff. It's not a natural disease, so it's going to have a natural consequence.
[3:51:56.440 --> 3:52:00.440]  Yes. And it's even the news that it's all over. So what do you think is really going on, Dave?
[3:52:00.440 --> 3:52:06.440]  Well, I have no idea. I mean, I've been watching you. I've been paying close attention. I mean, it's really got me worried.
[3:52:06.440 --> 3:52:18.440]  So I called into you to just see how long this lasts. I mean, I'm a dishwasher. So, I mean, I'm around bleach and constantly cleaning everything that I just cleaned and sanitized.
[3:52:18.440 --> 3:52:24.440]  It's just that, you know, if I'm shedding this stuff off, I mean, I don't want to kill my town. You know what I'm saying?
[3:52:24.440 --> 3:52:30.440]  You know, I don't think, you know, they're saying two percent, but that's still with people that were infected who are already run down.
[3:52:30.440 --> 3:52:38.440]  I think most of us, I think Trump's right. Overall, the hype's a hoax, but the concerted hype is killing the economy. This is the biggest salt.
[3:52:38.440 --> 3:52:44.440]  That's why it's real. Does that make sense? Well, if it's a bio weapon, it can also be designed to go after a specific trait in the DNA.
[3:52:44.440 --> 3:52:50.440]  Oh, the Asians are the ones that got to work. And that's what I'm saying. So if they're measuring things, because they won't actually take this into consideration,
[3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:55.440]  if they're measuring things based on results coming out of Asia or China, that doesn't mean those same results will translate.
[3:52:55.440 --> 3:53:01.440]  Because we know it has, the Asian males have the receptor sites in the lungs.
[3:53:01.440 --> 3:53:04.440]  So again, you have to, that goes back to bio weapon created in the lab.
[3:53:04.440 --> 3:53:11.440]  Yeah, you make a weapon that targets military aged men. I mean, it literally young men. You say, well, the U.S. made it. Yeah, Obama did.
[3:53:11.440 --> 3:53:16.440]  At the NIH in 2015, they sold it to the Chai comms.
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:21.440]  Yeah. And then the other scary thing about it is it just gives them the excuse to roll everything out to roll out the camps, to roll out the vaccines, to roll out.
[3:53:21.440 --> 3:53:27.440]  Well, and that's it. And who's China's biggest enemy? They're men. So in case they were going online, they've got a thing that hits men.
[3:53:27.440 --> 3:53:31.440]  And they're welding people's doors shut. And they've been doing that for weeks.
[3:53:31.440 --> 3:53:38.440]  Dave, God bless you. I think you're going to be fine. We don't sell like an Asia, but I get it. I get DNA force.
[3:53:38.440 --> 3:53:46.440]  I get bodies, ultimate tumor formula. It's all 40% off at all booster immune system. But brother, I get it.
[3:53:46.440 --> 3:53:52.440]  I don't have fever anymore. But I mean, I've just got this persistent cough that I haven't had in many, many years.
[3:53:52.440 --> 3:53:57.440]  You know, well, people are talking about how curcuminoids could be potentially helpful in putting this across.
[3:53:57.440 --> 3:54:01.440]  And of course, our tumeric supplement has a very high level of curcuminoids.
[3:54:01.440 --> 3:54:07.440]  That's how we fund the operation. So make hey, well, the sun shines 361 Patrick and mash. Go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:10.440]  Hey, how's it going, everybody? Good, brother. Thanks.
[3:54:10.440 --> 3:54:18.440]  Hey, back to the baseball talk, I think Trump's a little bit like my boy Ted Williams, the, you know, probably the best hitter of all time, but can't quite play the field, maybe.
[3:54:18.440 --> 3:54:19.440]  Yeah.
[3:54:19.440 --> 3:54:30.440]  But back to the virus talk, I think, you know, is there a chance that Mike Pence is, you know, playing damage control to ease some of the tension on Trump?
[3:54:30.440 --> 3:54:39.440]  Oh, I totally agree. And that makes Pence, in case he's trying to double cross Trump, I saw when Trump gave him that job, that that meant maybe Pence has been a worry for Trump.
[3:54:39.440 --> 3:54:41.440]  Because now it's on Pence.
[3:54:41.440 --> 3:54:47.440]  Yeah, kind of sets up a president Pence run. If things go right, maybe.
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:56.440]  Exactly. Trump's very smart on who he gives these things to. And look, I get why Trump's playing it down. You don't want to create a big panic.
[3:54:56.440 --> 3:55:05.440]  I mean, I totally agree. You know, back to the invasion thing, though, I feel like once there's a total travel ban in Europe, they're all going to be trapped there.
[3:55:05.440 --> 3:55:11.440]  You know, this invasion is taking place on the ground. I'm sure there's a whole network of refugees all throughout Europe.
[3:55:11.440 --> 3:55:17.440]  That's it. That's what I said at the start of the show, sir. This is all coordinated. This is all globalist. Erdogan's total globalist.
[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:26.440]  Erdogan, everybody says that, right? Thank you, Patrick. Sorry to jump. I need to get more people. Please call me back again tomorrow. Darren in Indiana. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:33.440]  Hey, Alex. Long time listener. First time caller. I've been taking your eye dine since I was probably about 15 years old.
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:34.440]  Wow.
[3:55:34.440 --> 3:55:46.440]  I just wanted to state that I believe this all has to go back to the Vatican City and the three city states. Obviously you got the District of Columbia City of London and then the Vatican.
[3:55:46.440 --> 3:55:57.440]  And I really feel like these big banks that rule the world are really testing our borders. And that's obviously why they want no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[3:55:57.440 --> 3:56:07.440]  Exactly. You've got tiny city states that the globalists admit they're not going to have a big Kumbaya World Guard, but they say it'll be tiny city states above the law, ground based Elysiums.
[3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:17.440]  And then we're all just totally enslaved, just like what's that book series that got turned into movies.
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:19.440]  What's it called?
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:21.440]  Where they've got the different districts?
[3:56:21.440 --> 3:56:27.440]  Oh, yeah, Hunger Games. Hunger Games. People go, oh, you're talking about Hunger Games? No, that's the UN model.
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:30.440]  Yeah. Or the Brave New World model.
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:33.440]  Absolutely. Anything else, Darren?
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:40.440]  Yeah, I just wanted to touch on the coronavirus real quick. I work in dangerous goods for a big shipping company and it's international, VHO.
[3:56:40.440 --> 3:56:43.440]  I'm sure you know what that is.
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:56.440]  I just wanted to say the amount of influx of the supplies that we are shipping to Hong Kong and NGO, cities like Shenzhen, all the Chinese cities over there.
[3:56:56.440 --> 3:57:06.440]  The masks, the Tyvek suits were sending these. It's accelerated hydrogen peroxide, which you know, kill your VOCs and your HIVs.
[3:57:06.440 --> 3:57:12.440]  And you can literally not count how many masks. I mean, we're going to be out of them, obviously.
[3:57:12.440 --> 3:57:19.440]  I understand. So it isn't just some hoax. They're hyping. You're seeing industrial level. Thank you, Darren. Sorry to Manny. Sorry to Joe.
[3:57:19.440 --> 3:57:27.440]  Here's the Smiths. Great job. Owen Stroyer takes over with the War Room in literally two minutes at infowars.com.
[3:57:27.440 --> 3:57:35.440]  Great job to the crew. We'll be back. Lord willing tomorrow as well with the Alex Jones show. David Knight, 8 a.m. Whatever you do, don't share those links.
[3:57:35.440 --> 3:57:50.440]  And David Rockefeller will thank you. Do not share the links at infowars.com. Do not do it.
