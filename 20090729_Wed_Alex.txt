[07:05.240 --> 07:08.720]  job he loved many years ago he was devastated but it taught him a lesson
[07:08.720 --> 07:12.720]  very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.640]  tells you how much he appreciates you every day there is no job security you
[07:16.640 --> 07:20.880]  are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood

[07:30.800 --> 07:34.920]  people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for

[08:32.360 --> 08:47.120]  all right ladies and gentlemen I was working on guest ideas out there during
[08:47.120 --> 08:53.120]  the three-minute break and then I didn't watch the atomic clock and almost didn't
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.640]  make it back in the studio like running down the hall they're like get in here
[08:57.640 --> 09:03.360]  I'm running with coffee in hand marathon runner quite a sprint the ten yards down
[09:03.360 --> 09:09.960]  the hall my exercise for the day I'm just joking folks I'm actually getting back
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.040]  into exercise I think everybody should it's making my brain work so much better
[09:15.040 --> 09:21.320]  months ago I passed the point of getting addicted to exercising again and for
[09:21.320 --> 09:25.160]  years I would try to get go back in the gym start jogging again and could never
[09:25.160 --> 09:31.040]  get to that addicted point addicted to the endorphins and now I am addicted I'm
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.600]  like dreaming about another nighttime jog this evening I had a nice jog this
[09:35.600 --> 09:43.280]  morning and I'm just thinking about jogging around the neighborhood in the
[09:43.280 --> 09:55.720]  hell country tonight if I get the time I want to kind of start the show today in
[09:55.720 --> 10:06.040]  a calm mode and just read the exciting headline from prisonplanet.com and a
[10:06.040 --> 10:11.280]  great story written by Paul Joseph Watson Gallup poll Americans turning
[10:11.280 --> 10:22.120]  against the Federal Reserve how exciting is that I want to go over that a
[10:22.120 --> 10:25.920]  little bit later in the hour and talk about that with Congressman Ron Paul who
[10:25.920 --> 10:34.240]  is coming up and then I don't just have Rob do does a great job producing doing
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.000]  producing now I have Jaron Nyhart and Paul Hartman and we tell you these guys
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.680]  are on fire they run the TV show radio show here in Austin Texas out of this
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.440]  studio and then in master control I guess you'd say Houston but it's not
[10:48.440 --> 10:58.280]  Houston it's Minneapolis St. Paul is a good old John Harmon oh my gosh he is
[10:58.280 --> 11:05.120]  great so he's up there in Houston and you could say the guys here in this
[11:05.120 --> 11:12.080]  office are Cape Canaveral as long as Marvin the Martian doesn't pop in I
[11:12.080 --> 11:22.920]  think we're gonna be just fine with this disintegrator beam but they booked two
[11:22.920 --> 11:31.600]  big astronauts I'm just gonna leave it at that and then now I'm realizing that
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.680]  they're booking all these huge guests as a bunch of others they're lining up in
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.360]  the next few weeks of course I don't want to give a hint to because we've done
[11:40.360 --> 11:43.840]  that before said who's coming on and people call and harass them or threaten
[11:43.840 --> 11:50.320]  I'm not to come on sometimes they don't but
[11:53.760 --> 12:01.280]  now I've got to do all this research on the moon landings because I can't just
[12:01.280 --> 12:07.360]  have astronauts on and then just throw the question out hey it's the 40th
[12:07.360 --> 12:14.840]  anniversary a few weeks ago some people question the moon landing so in a way
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.000]  it's kind of bad to have producers this good because I just told them go after
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.920]  whoever you want go after whatever he thinks big and boy it is scary who
[12:24.920 --> 12:28.160]  they're going after and who they're getting because I'm busy trying to finish
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.160]  the new film that I will I want to watch the website before I announce the name
[12:32.160 --> 12:35.720]  and put out a trailer but I'm so busy finishing the film I'm not even making
[12:35.720 --> 12:41.880]  trailers or websites or oh my gosh it is such a doozy the film we're making right
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.240]  now it just each film just gets better and better and this one is scary powerful
[12:46.240 --> 12:53.040]  scary cinematic scary good but I went home early last night I went home in
[12:53.040 --> 13:00.800]  11 and then it's addicting I want to make film after film after film and get
[13:00.800 --> 13:04.040]  better and better and better and better footage and better and better interviews
[13:04.040 --> 13:09.360]  but then I want to see my family and I'm not trying to pontificate here I'm
[13:09.360 --> 13:13.080]  just trying to shift gears psychologically mentally in the tone of
[13:13.080 --> 13:18.080]  the show at least some of the time and not go into my king gorilla hopping
[13:18.080 --> 13:23.800]  around in the banana trees thumping my chest which I tend to do because I get
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.520]  threatened by the new world order and threatened by the establishment at a
[13:27.520 --> 13:39.120]  very primitive level you know I intellectually I intellectually analyze
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.280]  the facts and the information very coldly and as you get deeper into the
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.800]  knowledge and research and understanding of societies and civilizations and
[13:48.800 --> 13:53.360]  propaganda and psychology and media and the way all these different art forms
[13:53.360 --> 13:58.160]  and sciences get mixed together in this dark alchemy of brainwashing and new
[13:58.160 --> 14:05.600]  world order culture it's a culture of plasticness and fakeness and metallic
[14:05.600 --> 14:11.960]  ozone stink it's it's just one cannot be told about the matrix one must see it
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.760]  and how many of you have seen it and seen large facets of it I the more I
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.920]  learn about it the more I realize we have to fight the new world order we have
[14:21.920 --> 14:28.400]  to defeat it but at the same time it's it's pathetic it's disgusting it's
[14:28.400 --> 14:38.960]  stinking it's it's mind-blowing congressman Ron Paul's coming up in the
[14:38.960 --> 14:41.560]  first half hour of the show next hour unless something happens on the house
[14:41.560 --> 14:45.120]  floor that he may be on later you know it's fluid with these congressmen when
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.600]  they come on but he's set for the show today and he almost always appears when
[14:50.600 --> 14:57.080]  we meet him on the road is it the road to tyranny or the road to liberty we
[14:57.080 --> 15:04.440]  decide that we decide our fates that is we have a great a great say in our fates
[15:04.440 --> 15:09.280]  if we call the Providence and stand up with courage and put on the breastplate
[15:09.280 --> 15:17.080]  of righteousness the sword of truth and if we endeavor and persevere and go
[15:17.080 --> 15:23.480]  through the tribulations of life the slings and arrows the darts we tend to
[15:23.480 --> 15:29.640]  be given victory unless it's in God's plan that we play another part but
[15:29.640 --> 15:33.240]  always the victory of liberty and freedom and truth lies at the end if
[15:33.240 --> 15:42.400]  good men take the field but one must be careful as you stare into the abyss that
[15:42.400 --> 15:46.720]  you do not become the abyss I forget the philosopher that said that and when I
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.360]  read that as a teenager I didn't quite grasp it but now I can read all the
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.760]  great philosophers those that touch the souls of us those that tell us something
[15:56.760 --> 16:03.720]  that we've already seen but form it in such beautiful poetry when you dance
[16:03.720 --> 16:13.240]  with the devil the devil doesn't change you change so be careful that when you
[16:13.240 --> 16:22.840]  look into the eyes of the siren and hear the song that you have an anchor in
[16:22.840 --> 16:31.160]  love and light or you will be destroyed but it's a delicate balance
[16:33.400 --> 16:44.080]  certainly is that isn't it and I have not done the best job at being calm at
[16:44.080 --> 16:51.280]  being focused going to that deep still water place that lies at the base of our
[16:51.280 --> 17:04.320]  souls but in that place then quiet still place there is no more fear there is no
[17:04.320 --> 17:11.160]  more pain if there is a pain it's only a lingering memory of what man was and
[17:11.160 --> 17:17.120]  what man could become a sense of something older a sense of being part of
[17:17.120 --> 17:23.000]  a creation limitless endless knowing that there are great secrets and great
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.920]  truths buried in our instincts and our DNA programming that we are a great
[17:27.920 --> 17:36.640]  species and that our age is much greater and we are told these truths speak to
[17:36.640 --> 17:43.440]  our hearts and minds and souls they speak to the fabric of what we are
[17:43.440 --> 17:48.400]  all right I have massive stacks of important news here we have loaded
[17:48.400 --> 17:53.400]  phone lines we're gonna take calls throughout much of the four hours to
[17:53.400 --> 18:06.560]  day that we're already 18 minutes in tube on my mark but I jumped out of the
[18:06.560 --> 18:12.080]  shower this morning as I was having a brainstorm and scribbled on the nearest
[18:12.080 --> 18:21.240]  piece of paper a children's book I scribbled on the inside cover these
[18:21.240 --> 18:31.040]  quick bullet points to remember the brainstorm and I want to go over these
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.800]  when we get back as briefly as I can and then we're gonna go to your phone
[18:35.800 --> 18:44.600]  calls then we're gonna take your phone calls at 1-800-25-99-231 and then I
[18:44.600 --> 18:51.400]  will get into the eugenics grid what socialized health care does they are
[18:51.400 --> 18:58.080]  admitting the head of the CDC the head of the Department of Agriculture of all
[18:58.080 --> 19:03.880]  divisions the head of the EPA I remember reading this when I first really started
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.280]  doing a crash course and research 14 years ago I had a lot of research but
[19:08.280 --> 19:13.160]  getting on TV and radio really as a way of focusing you I remember reading
[19:13.160 --> 19:18.360]  federal government proposals to have a national ID card in a global system it's
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.240]  tied into that tracks everything you buy someone do on one front to track
[19:23.240 --> 19:27.760]  everything you eat your exercise everything chronicled in government
[19:27.760 --> 19:35.320]  databases under socialized health care well they're now proposing it and then
[19:35.320 --> 19:39.400]  you watch Chris Matthews or any of these channels they say all the conspiracy
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.800]  theorists say it's socialized health care and they laugh at everybody and they
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.600]  wonder why they're losing all credibility people are going and reading the
[19:47.600 --> 19:52.880]  legislation they're going and reading what the CDC says I mean you guys are
[19:52.880 --> 20:01.280]  completely discredited but I guess just keep up your lying if the current state

[20:05.480 --> 20:09.800]  important information you will ever hear as the economy continues to spiral out

[20:13.880 --> 20:17.640]  family and pay their bills the government is not going to help out the
[20:17.640 --> 20:21.640]  people who desperately need it it's time for you to look outside the box and

[21:05.520 --> 21:10.200]  brokers investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA that's right
[21:10.200 --> 21:15.760]  gold has been available to be placed in IRA since 1986 yet still the financial

[21:19.800 --> 21:24.480]  retirement the truth be told gold and silver is outperform paper investments
[21:24.480 --> 21:30.080]  like stocks bonds and CDs yet no word about IRAs perhaps the financial
[21:30.080 --> 21:34.120]  institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper if

[22:03.600 --> 22:08.520]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national
[22:08.520 --> 22:14.360]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded the
[22:14.360 --> 22:19.000]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.640]  interest of the American people well Obama's already fudging yeah but since
[22:23.640 --> 22:28.120]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[22:28.120 --> 22:32.800]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[22:32.800 --> 22:38.080]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or right
[22:38.080 --> 22:43.640]  it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the

[24:01.720 --> 24:09.120]  all right here's some of the bullet points I want to go over then we're
[24:09.120 --> 24:12.760]  going to take your phone calls then break down this headline Gallup poll
[24:12.760 --> 24:16.960]  Americans turning against the Federal Reserve the dollar starting to slide
[24:16.960 --> 24:27.720]  again and a lot more it is all coming up but the number one point I want to make
[24:27.720 --> 24:32.000]  is when I talk about myself humans are all very very similar and all like so I'm
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.960]  talking about all of us together but there were a wake or not I intellectually
[24:40.960 --> 24:47.800]  and historically approach this information and research it in a cold
[24:47.800 --> 24:55.200]  calculated manner and then I'm good at researching it and good at understanding
[24:55.200 --> 24:58.240]  it and then people think I'm good at presenting it but I actually don't think
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.680]  that's my strong suit I then come on air and try to break down the full
[25:02.680 --> 25:07.920]  magnitude and as I start connecting all the dots and laying it out at a
[25:07.920 --> 25:16.320]  primitive level I then become aggressive just like a crab that's walking down the
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.760]  beach and you run over to it and it puts its pinchers up in defensive mode I kind
[25:21.760 --> 25:26.800]  of shift into silverback gorilla mode of thumping my chest to the new world
[25:26.800 --> 25:32.120]  order and then that actually plays into the globalist system at certain levels
[25:32.120 --> 25:36.800]  because then their minions their servants shift into that mode as well and
[25:36.800 --> 25:43.440]  the key to this in shifting our paradigm is understanding we really are all in
[25:43.440 --> 25:48.880]  the same boat together there are less than six thousand super managers and
[25:48.880 --> 25:51.320]  controllers according to the head of the Kissinger Group and many other
[25:51.320 --> 25:54.840]  think tank documents I've read and in public articles they write in the
[25:54.840 --> 26:01.160]  Washington Post one article titled superclass from last year where they
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.440]  brag yeah we're sent up a world government we know best for you and we're
[26:06.440 --> 26:09.680]  gonna have a world bank that controls every facet of your life in a carbon
[26:09.680 --> 26:17.160]  tax and their argument is the public doesn't even want to have a debate about
[26:17.160 --> 26:22.000]  this and we can tell the public we don't exist while simultaneously telling
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.600]  intellectuals we do and look at how the public then buys our propaganda that is
[26:26.600 --> 26:32.280]  prima facie evidence that they're basically subhuman and deserve this it's a
[26:32.280 --> 26:40.680]  very sick intellectual rule they follow it's kind of the old parable of a
[26:40.680 --> 26:47.640]  vampire has to trick you to give them entrance and invite them into the house
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.080]  and though vampires themselves don't exist there are many divisions of
[26:53.080 --> 27:00.200]  sadomastic psychopaths who are mentally ill and believe their vampires and then
[27:00.200 --> 27:05.280]  there are other subgroups that's really an art type of the psychopath and their
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.760]  guilds the intelligent high-functioning psychopaths array themselves and guilds
[27:10.760 --> 27:17.440]  and they like geometric shapes and marching armies in black uniforms and
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.920]  red banners red black and white are their colors those three arrayed together
[27:22.920 --> 27:26.760]  and just gets deeper into the psychopath psychology and again from that
[27:26.760 --> 27:35.160]  point I go off into the mass fractal overlay of their system and grasping
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.760]  it it's very hard to describe it's like trying to describe to somebody a
[27:38.760 --> 27:45.640]  pastoral mountain scene or green hills or trying to describe diving on a coral
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.480]  reef and seeing a hammerhead shark you know 100 feet below you and in schools
[27:50.480 --> 27:58.200]  of fish and Spanish mackerel I mean it's you one cannot really describe it one
[27:58.200 --> 28:05.560]  has to see it so I can only give you a little small brushstrokes in the
[28:05.560 --> 28:10.880]  overall tapestry and the radio show itself will give you a deep review into
[28:10.880 --> 28:16.200]  that over time and then you will say yes I've seen that I've seen this different
[28:16.200 --> 28:19.400]  little points of light in your own research in your own life in your own
[28:19.400 --> 28:27.720]  experience but hence the saying one cannot be told about this matrix one has
[28:27.720 --> 28:34.160]  to see it and the globalists write books describing much of it and saying oh
[28:34.160 --> 28:37.920]  they'll even laugh at the rear and say oh maybe you're not with us but you see
[28:37.920 --> 28:43.680]  it but you notice your friends and family can't see you're someone who might
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.840]  want to join us but they're not really offering for you to join so that's
[28:48.840 --> 28:55.160]  another riddle and another lie and even if you joined the elite abuse their own
[28:55.160 --> 29:02.520]  six thousand servants six thousand super gophers less than 20 mega families that
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.960]  rule them and they have generation for generation of servant families that
[29:06.960 --> 29:14.240]  serve them and they're servant families the Darwin's and the Edgewood's and the
[29:14.400 --> 29:21.560]  Galton's and the Huxley's and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the
[29:21.560 --> 29:32.240]  Bushes and the Careys and the Rothmans I'm gonna continue along this line they're
[29:32.240 --> 29:36.840]  all intermarried the elites five or six generations in will then marry into
[29:36.840 --> 29:43.800]  their superclass servants and so it's like a breed of dog it's like a breed
[29:43.800 --> 29:48.400]  apart in fact they write particles saying that about themselves a breed of
[29:48.400 --> 29:55.720]  psychopaths we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[35:02.480 --> 35:13.200]  it's for this part right here this song goes out to the mainstream media whose
[35:13.200 --> 35:21.140]  ratings are imploding as everybody gets anti-new-world order fever and as we
[35:21.140 --> 35:40.960]  shake off the virus that is the new world order oh the rabbit done died all
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.360]  right we are back live you know these guys that run from women when the rabbit
[35:46.360 --> 35:53.980]  dies they don't know what they're missing kids are great marry that woman
[35:53.980 --> 35:58.620]  all right shut it down or I'm gonna continue listening to it and commenting
[35:58.620 --> 36:04.740]  on it spoken word read to Aerosmith yeah they would what was that old
[36:04.740 --> 36:09.820]  pregnancy test they would inject a rabbit with a woman's urine and the
[36:09.820 --> 36:14.180]  hormone would kill the rabbit and that's why the term if you got a woman
[36:14.180 --> 36:21.660]  pregnant it was the rabbit done died that's where that term comes from I get
[36:21.660 --> 36:25.820]  excited I guess when the rabbit died that's neat man kids are great that's
[36:25.820 --> 36:30.660]  more new world order eugenics bull telling you wives and husbands aren't good
[36:30.660 --> 36:34.420]  and kids aren't great the kids are the best thing in the world but I guess if
[36:34.420 --> 36:39.500]  you come from it from the perspective of it's horrible then you're gonna have a
[36:39.500 --> 36:47.420]  terrible time it's the best thing in the universe it's God's greatest gift
[36:47.420 --> 36:53.340]  magical little creatures filled with wonderment and innocence and discovery
[36:53.340 --> 37:03.300]  a gateway into the soul a second childhood we're meant to be like children
[37:03.300 --> 37:13.900]  throughout our lives but a duality childlike but also old and wise once the
[37:13.900 --> 37:23.100]  man twice the child that Shakespeare again okay let me go over these bullet
[37:23.100 --> 37:27.660]  points and we'll get to your calls and in all the news and Ron Paul
[37:27.660 --> 37:36.900]  so we have to understand that we do need to get emotional about this to give us
[37:36.900 --> 37:40.580]  the energy the fire in the belly to fight the New World Order but it's a
[37:40.580 --> 37:46.460]  combination of balance we need to coldly look at the facts though a lot of
[37:46.460 --> 37:49.820]  people are emotionally wedded to the New World Order of the Democratic Party of
[37:49.820 --> 37:54.420]  the Republican Party or to their preconceived notions their worldview
[37:54.420 --> 37:58.860]  they have cognitive dissonance they are defending the ideas that have been
[37:58.860 --> 38:04.140]  put in their mind the distortions the twisted information my goal is not even
[38:04.140 --> 38:07.620]  tell you what to think or how to think but to get outside the box take off the
[38:07.620 --> 38:12.100]  blinders no one can deny that we don't know that much as humans on this planet
[38:12.100 --> 38:16.460]  about physics of the nature of the universe we learn more and more we're a
[38:16.460 --> 38:21.740]  quantum level above our ancestors just a thousand years ago today but no dollar
[38:21.740 --> 38:25.660]  ancestors a hundred years from now we survive become a type one society will
[38:25.660 --> 38:33.220]  be an entire quantum level above that there is a crisis in the paradigm though
[38:33.220 --> 38:40.700]  of human development human society the way we live the way we operate all of
[38:40.700 --> 38:47.140]  human society in our thousands of years of development is now being focused and
[38:47.140 --> 38:50.900]  accelerated and there's more changes in 10 years than there were in the previous
[38:50.900 --> 38:57.580]  hundred now when the globalists understand this and they are seeking to
[38:58.140 --> 39:03.380]  irrevocably twist and alter the human species into their image as they play
[39:03.380 --> 39:07.500]  God on every front with their RFID and their drones and their drugging of the
[39:07.500 --> 39:12.700]  water and food their GMO crops and their societal attack on the family openly
[39:12.700 --> 39:20.060]  saying they're trying to remove it and change it the planetary government they
[39:20.060 --> 39:23.220]  want we're all children will be raised in government dormitories and
[39:23.220 --> 39:28.780]  sterilized this is official government textbooks and we've listed them here at
[39:28.780 --> 39:37.460]  nauseam like eco science by the White House science are John P. Holdren this
[39:37.460 --> 39:44.420]  is the real issue and so we need to intellectually make our decisions and
[39:44.420 --> 39:49.740]  and and and be political atheist who coldly analyze anthropology sociology
[39:49.740 --> 39:54.220]  and real human history and read what the government propagandist hired by the
[39:54.220 --> 40:03.460]  Pentagon their top futurist like Marshall and of course currently they have
[40:03.460 --> 40:08.820]  another top minion Ray Kurzweil and many others and we have to look at what
[40:08.820 --> 40:14.700]  Huxley had to say in Russell and Wells and countless others and you read their
[40:14.700 --> 40:24.100]  philosophy that's all published it is hellraiser sick and whether they can
[40:24.100 --> 40:27.540]  actually manifest their plans doesn't matter because they are going in that
[40:27.540 --> 40:33.700]  direction and they are in control of ship earth starship earth they are in
[40:33.700 --> 40:38.940]  control of homo sapien sapien they believe they're creating homo sapien
[40:38.940 --> 40:46.180]  sapien super erectus and they are not they are creating homo sapien sapien
[40:46.180 --> 40:49.020]  Diablo
[40:52.380 --> 41:04.020]  homo sapien sapien Satan a jealous greedy petulant abusive control freak
[41:04.020 --> 41:08.300]  creature hell bent on dominating and controlling everything under death
[41:08.300 --> 41:15.820]  a nihilistic nerve of power pressed on you read the sick poetry of linen and
[41:15.820 --> 41:19.020]  all these guys it's about how they want to destroy the earth and murder people
[41:19.020 --> 41:23.140]  and drive spikes through everyone's eyes and it's all the same with these
[41:23.140 --> 41:26.420]  people I mean I've got some of their quotes some of the top futurist quotes
[41:26.420 --> 41:30.260]  in the endgame about we'll go on willing and destroy the earth and murder
[41:30.260 --> 41:34.180]  everyone and we'll detonate hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and blow
[41:34.180 --> 41:38.220]  holes in the mantle and let the atmosphere spill into space if we want to
[41:38.220 --> 41:42.340]  and we'll have the Hadron superconductor create strange listen black holes and
[41:42.340 --> 41:49.380]  destroy the entire earth and the inside of this Hadron superconducting super
[41:49.380 --> 41:53.820]  collider looks like a Geiger painting and we're gonna slam it into high gear
[41:53.820 --> 42:04.260]  and no one's gonna stop us we're gonna open the gate I'm not the one writing
[42:04.260 --> 42:08.820]  this and saying it and they got Shiva the god of destruction and creation
[42:08.820 --> 42:14.940]  statue above it on I mean if you read like we ought to pull it up the inventor
[42:14.940 --> 42:23.020]  of the new because his his of the a bomb is teller like you can YouTube teller I
[42:23.020 --> 42:28.220]  am the god Shiva the god the goddess of destruction that YouTube that we ought
[42:28.220 --> 42:41.780]  to pull that up he's like we were the creators of destroyers of worlds I mean
[42:41.780 --> 42:54.980]  folks you need to know what you're facing that was strange all the lights
[42:54.980 --> 43:01.900]  just went off in the studio it just came back on I mean the more I research
[43:01.900 --> 43:06.540]  these people it's like a bad dream it just it is insane they are the ones
[43:06.540 --> 43:18.540]  that are insane and they know how to manipulate your psychology they have you
[43:18.540 --> 43:22.740]  an arrested development like a child but kind of a false childhood everything's
[43:22.740 --> 43:27.940]  a counterfeit of happy and fun and the teleprompter reading info babes laugh
[43:27.940 --> 43:32.020]  and smile that everything's giggly and funny on the different morning shows in
[43:32.020 --> 43:36.460]  nighttime shows and it's all about distraction and diversion and just
[43:36.460 --> 43:39.740]  caring about yourself not knowing that when you don't care about anybody but
[43:39.740 --> 43:43.700]  yourself you lose yourself and become enslaved there's nobody else cares about
[43:43.700 --> 43:53.500]  anybody when you don't care about anybody else you become a slave and so they
[43:53.500 --> 43:58.020]  take your human instinct to defend the young the weak the widows the innocent
[43:58.020 --> 44:03.140]  they take your warrior spirit your protector spirit both men and women have
[44:03.140 --> 44:08.180]  that spirit that template that idea burned across our brains and they take
[44:08.180 --> 44:14.020]  it and they say oh don't eat or don't hunt don't fish be a vegetarian it's
[44:14.020 --> 44:20.460]  abusive to eat fish it's abusive to eat me and I'm not saying that I look down
[44:20.460 --> 44:27.540]  on vegetarians I think that's great if that's your choice and what you do but
[44:27.540 --> 44:30.540]  you have to understand they're already putting animal DNA into your food so
[44:30.540 --> 44:35.860]  they've made it something far worse than even some GMO beef but see there's
[44:35.860 --> 44:39.660]  wheels within wheels the point is they give you a fake template of oh my god
[44:39.660 --> 44:45.620]  you're hunting you hunt deer you hunt rabbits yeah they instantly die it's
[44:45.620 --> 44:48.860]  not that you enjoy killing the animal it's your instinct and when you go out
[44:48.860 --> 44:52.580]  and hunt and get in a blind and shoot a deer at a hundred yards away with a bow
[44:52.580 --> 44:57.660]  it triggers other primitive areas of the brain that then tie into the more
[44:57.660 --> 45:02.940]  advanced levels of the cerebral cortex and unlocks other things like your
[45:02.940 --> 45:10.060]  peripheral eyesight when you begin hunting turns on your your your capacity
[45:10.060 --> 45:19.060]  to to see they've done studies on this you know the hidden images those
[45:19.060 --> 45:36.500]  pictures they have a psychological test so it's what you're meant to do it's
[45:36.500 --> 45:39.900]  what you're designed to do but no no go into the store and picking up the meat
[45:39.900 --> 45:43.660]  you know the worst people are the ones that don't hunt and think it's evil but
[45:43.660 --> 45:46.700]  then they go buy the chicken that lived in a torture cage they go buy the beef
[45:46.700 --> 45:52.060]  or they go buy the fish or whatever and then but still ho holier than now walk
[45:52.060 --> 45:55.100]  around griping at people that actually go out and do it themselves see it's a
[45:55.100 --> 46:01.260]  war against being human being primitive and saying primitive is bad when
[46:01.260 --> 46:04.820]  actually primitive is advanced because primitive is it primitive it's just
[46:04.820 --> 46:09.900]  being human so if we took the primitive instincts and ideas and systems and use
[46:09.900 --> 46:15.140]  them in a modern context that is the Superman but instead they tell you
[46:15.140 --> 46:25.460]  modern is a closed-minded stunted weak domesticated creature but that's only
[46:25.460 --> 46:31.260]  one side issue the main point about and this is just one window and a thousands
[46:31.260 --> 46:37.460]  of points they do on this oh I'm a good loving human being I don't eat meat or I
[46:37.460 --> 46:42.780]  don't hunt but then the people that are always against eating meat or always
[46:42.780 --> 46:46.700]  against hunting seem to always be for abortion and they smile and giggle and
[46:46.700 --> 46:50.020]  lick their lips like it's a special right and you're not gonna stop them
[46:50.020 --> 46:58.580]  killing their babies if you really love life so much then why are you for
[46:58.580 --> 47:03.380]  killing your own species and lying and saying it's not a human why don't you
[47:03.380 --> 47:09.020]  adopt those third trimester of babies why don't you why don't you adopt them
[47:09.020 --> 47:13.820]  out people want them see it's all a lie the lovers of death the lovers of
[47:13.820 --> 47:17.380]  saying oh we got to have eugenics and exterminate most the humans it's for the
[47:17.380 --> 47:20.540]  earth then you find out the top eugenicist actually you're saying no
[47:20.540 --> 47:24.420]  we're playing God we're gonna re genetically re-engineer the whole planet
[47:24.420 --> 47:27.420]  we just want to get rid of the rest of humanity because they're dumb and
[47:27.420 --> 47:31.260]  subhuman and don't deserve the life extension technology and the future's
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.860]  ours and so the sicko techno neo eugenicist transhumanist they come to the
[47:37.860 --> 47:43.380]  rest of the public and say we want to sell you on saving the earth get rid of
[47:43.380 --> 47:48.660]  yourselves and they take your very instinct to be a good steward of the
[47:48.660 --> 47:52.260]  land and to protect the environment and take care of yourself and your family
[47:52.260 --> 47:55.700]  that's part of the environment and to not poison the environment and they turn
[47:55.700 --> 47:59.580]  that against your very life force instinct and reprogram your life force
[47:59.580 --> 48:05.860]  instinct to now kill yourself that survival so they take and that was
[48:05.860 --> 48:10.460]  naturally there to defend the tribe the warriors may have to die the needs of the
[48:10.460 --> 48:16.180]  few you know we're outweighed by the needs of the many or the needs of the
[48:16.180 --> 48:21.900]  one or outweighed by the needs of the many of the few which is true if it's
[48:21.900 --> 48:26.220]  selflessly directed but see they take that and misdirected from their
[48:26.220 --> 48:30.340]  programmed system I'd said I'd go to your calls we're gonna do that at the
[48:30.340 --> 48:33.660]  bottom of the next hour one after Ron Paul leaves us I need to continue on
[48:33.660 --> 48:37.140]  this line so the callers can hang up and call back if they want they can stay
[48:37.140 --> 48:46.380]  there but I distract again from the main issue I was covering I divert myself
[48:46.380 --> 48:51.060]  from it the point is these are the truths and the systems and the algorithms
[48:51.060 --> 48:55.140]  that the enemy uses they take your natural instincts your natural self-defense
[48:55.140 --> 49:02.300]  mechanisms and turn them in against you it's like your vaccines most of their
[49:02.300 --> 49:06.580]  soft-kill weapons are designed around triggering autoimmune responses that
[49:06.580 --> 49:18.420]  attack the pancreas of the brain or the uterus of the testicles this is a very
[49:18.420 --> 49:25.620]  very dark logic a dark genius the enemy has you have to respect them and also
[49:25.620 --> 49:30.900]  realize that they are committed to their cause and quite simply if you read the
[49:30.900 --> 49:39.420]  philosophy none of the Bible the congressman's going to vote we got to get
[49:39.420 --> 49:46.780]  him on right now oh that's fine I just want to get my full 30 minutes well
[49:46.780 --> 49:49.580]  that's how it is when you're on the floor I'm gonna get a whole hour from the
[49:49.580 --> 49:53.580]  congressman I'll go through all these other points later we'll do your calls
[49:53.580 --> 49:57.180]  I want to refocus kind of these bull it is a bunch of bullet points get into all
[49:57.180 --> 50:01.100]  the news but the globalist are sociologists they're anthropologists
[50:01.100 --> 50:09.860]  they understand what they are doing and there they know what makes humans tick
[50:09.860 --> 50:14.100]  they understand how we operate and they are just cold-bloodily doing that we
[50:14.100 --> 50:18.620]  have to realize that 99.99% of us are in the same boat together against the
[50:18.620 --> 50:24.100]  globalist we have to understand that we're all together as humanity against a
[50:24.100 --> 50:33.340]  few thousand global controllers I'm gonna go ahead and skip John should have
[50:33.340 --> 50:36.820]  given you a heads up I'm gonna skip this network break right now so we're gonna
[50:36.820 --> 50:40.380]  fade the music down I don't know how long we've got him and we've got
[50:40.380 --> 50:44.020]  congressman Ron Paul with us I apologize the stations but this is a network
[50:44.020 --> 50:48.460]  break so we are taking this network break with congressman Ron Paul he's
[50:48.460 --> 50:52.740]  voting today about to have to run on the floor and so he's having to come on a
[50:52.740 --> 50:57.020]  bit early congressman great to have you on with us here sir good Alex good to be
[50:57.020 --> 51:02.220]  with you again good to have you here Gallup poll shows that now a majority of
[51:02.220 --> 51:07.060]  Americans would abolish the Federal Reserve if they could according to CNBC
[51:07.060 --> 51:12.500]  can you comment on this exciting development congressman well I think
[51:12.500 --> 51:16.980]  it's rather amazing you know a year or two ago I imagine very few people even
[51:16.980 --> 51:21.460]  thought about the Federal Reserve but I think because of the economic crisis
[51:21.460 --> 51:24.820]  because of the blundering with tarp funds where the American people said we
[51:24.820 --> 51:28.660]  need to know what you guys are doing and how you're wasting the money we saw an
[51:28.660 --> 51:32.180]  opening that we could call attention to the American people about what kind of
[51:32.180 --> 51:35.940]  shenanigans been going on in the Federal Reserve and that along with the
[51:35.940 --> 51:39.740]  presidential campaign all of a sudden the Federal Reserve now has become a key
[51:39.740 --> 51:43.540]  issue which is something you and I've been arguing for a good many years and
[51:43.540 --> 51:47.140]  of course it was the issue that prompted me to go into politics and lo and
[51:47.140 --> 51:53.020]  behold now it's front and center on in the debate and there's a lot more yet to
[51:53.020 --> 51:57.460]  come we need to know what they're doing that's why our auto bill is so important
[51:57.460 --> 52:02.540]  but eventually though we need a sound monetary system and I think if we
[52:02.540 --> 52:06.300]  continue with our progress hopefully we'll reach that point someday
[52:06.300 --> 52:11.500]  congressman you said back during the campaign in 2008 something big is
[52:11.500 --> 52:16.220]  happening and I even tend to underestimate I've been telling you for
[52:16.220 --> 52:19.940]  years that I think we're starting to win and you've been optimistic but also you
[52:19.940 --> 52:24.260]  know somewhat conservative saying well let's just keep working but do you
[52:24.260 --> 52:28.700]  revise your forecast I mean that that the something big you talked about is
[52:28.700 --> 52:32.580]  even bigger than we had even hoped and happening quicker I mean I think this is
[52:32.580 --> 52:37.580]  something bordering on 1776 or what happened to Chalcescu in Romania I
[52:37.580 --> 52:42.580]  think it's more explosive than even you or I may have thought previously yeah and
[52:42.580 --> 52:48.580]  I don't pretend to know exactly what will happen and when but you know when
[52:48.580 --> 52:53.660]  you distort things grossly so like we have for 35 years you know it has to
[52:53.660 --> 52:57.980]  give and and at that time it wasn't clear cut exactly what would happen so the
[52:57.980 --> 53:03.060]  financial crisis hit the house of cars has come down and that is really pretty
[53:03.060 --> 53:06.700]  big is what's going on but no I think it's even bigger than that in both the
[53:06.700 --> 53:10.900]  negative and the positive side because I think we're working now on the dollar
[53:10.900 --> 53:15.580]  crisis and a dollar crisis will be ten times it will be a ten times bigger
[53:15.580 --> 53:21.620]  event than the financial collapse and then the big deal will be which way are
[53:21.620 --> 53:26.220]  we going to go are we going to say as Americans that you know we had a taste
[53:26.220 --> 53:29.980]  of freedom we want our freedom back and we want constitutional law we want sound
[53:29.980 --> 53:35.980]  money or are we going to be complacent and the majority of people say yes let
[53:35.980 --> 53:38.580]  the government do whatever they want they'll take care of us we trust the
[53:38.580 --> 53:45.020]  government so we're in the midst of that and I'm hoping like you are that we can
[53:45.020 --> 53:49.580]  win this fight and people opt for more freedom rather than more dependency but
[53:49.580 --> 53:53.860]  we're we're a little bit off from that because right now in Washington everybody
[53:53.860 --> 53:58.300]  you know still pushing more government I mean just look at what Obama's doing
[53:58.300 --> 54:03.500]  with more war more spending more borrowing more socialized medicine more
[54:03.500 --> 54:11.500]  cap and trade more taxes but at home when I go home or around the country or
[54:11.500 --> 54:15.700]  talk on radio shows I find out that there's literally not tens of thousands
[54:15.700 --> 54:20.220]  but literally millions of people who understand exactly what's going on and
[54:20.220 --> 54:24.660]  they've had enough and I think this spontaneity with some of these tea
[54:24.660 --> 54:29.140]  parties show that there's a lot of people very upset with what's happening
[54:29.140 --> 54:33.980]  well yes sir we've gone in the last year from the media laughing at anti
[54:33.980 --> 54:38.020]  Federal Reserve movement and the anti-globalist movement to now openly on
[54:38.020 --> 54:41.420]  the news every night they're saying they're scared the establishment is
[54:41.420 --> 54:45.700]  openly up there on their parapets the control left-right paradigm admitting
[54:45.700 --> 54:51.020]  that this movement is like a bushfire set in the minds of men as Thomas
[54:51.020 --> 54:57.100]  Jefferson said I I mentioned I think the poll the scientific poll there's
[54:57.100 --> 55:02.900]  gallops and others showing that below 50 percent for the Federal Reserve now
[55:02.900 --> 55:08.740]  and growing Obama and his approval rating now the lowest of any modern
[55:08.740 --> 55:14.140]  president at this point six months in to office it just looks like government
[55:14.140 --> 55:19.140]  on every front is in free fall unless your pro-liberty libertarian like
[55:19.140 --> 55:23.420]  yourself and in your numbers are just going off the chart info wars calm
[55:23.420 --> 55:27.460]  numbers my radio shows being picked up by more and more stations this show is
[55:27.460 --> 55:32.380]  exploding every other indicator is liberty is rising tyranny is still
[55:32.380 --> 55:37.100]  juggernautting forward but losing momentum as they drive through their
[55:37.100 --> 55:41.740]  agenda comment on this I think one of the best symbols of what you're talking
[55:41.740 --> 55:46.580]  about is the fact that the fan feels so much on the fans and the chairman of the
[55:46.580 --> 55:55.580]  Federal Reserve board outlawed to have a whole town hall meeting that is that is hilarious but that also shows that they're on the
[55:55.580 --> 55:59.580]  defensive and we are we're on the offensive but we have two on our side
[55:59.580 --> 56:04.940]  I mean the absurdity that they can control us forever by just printing money
[56:04.940 --> 56:09.180]  and claiming that they will always have wealth by printing money it's so absurd
[56:09.180 --> 56:16.460]  that the people realize this so they I think since we have honest money and
[56:16.460 --> 56:20.140]  truth and limited government and freedom on our side if we if we don't win
[56:20.140 --> 56:25.340]  there's something awfully wrong with us and yet I think that obviously we're
[56:25.340 --> 56:29.780]  making great progress well I think knowing we can win and historically
[56:29.780 --> 56:34.180]  having some victories that is always what leads to the victory having right on
[56:34.180 --> 56:38.460]  your side having history common sense free market and then having victories and
[56:38.460 --> 56:43.020]  seeing that we can actually go up against these people I it's very exciting
[56:43.020 --> 56:46.580]  I mean the fight is just now starting I'm not saying it's easy but I think the
[56:46.580 --> 56:50.940]  momentum starting to shift sir you've talked a lot previously about stage
[56:50.940 --> 56:54.940]  crises Gulf of Tonkin type events they're now green lighting Biden and
[56:54.940 --> 56:58.380]  others saying yeah we will support Israel they have a right to hit Iran
[56:58.380 --> 57:03.660]  economic crises economic terrorism paying banks not to lend as
[57:03.660 --> 57:07.380]  consent has been covering your fellow congressman what tricks do they have up
[57:07.380 --> 57:13.340]  their sleeves or are you concerned about stage crises yeah I'm concerned but I
[57:13.340 --> 57:18.540]  don't have any insight to what they plan or what they will do and it may be an
[57:18.540 --> 57:24.900]  accident that they will play on or blow up or react to so it isn't it doesn't
[57:24.900 --> 57:29.100]  necessarily have to be absolutely can't drive they may have you know an
[57:29.100 --> 57:34.300]  accidental confrontation or sometimes they'll just go out and and something
[57:34.300 --> 57:39.300]  gets blown up and this will incite the people but I don't have any immediate
[57:39.300 --> 57:46.060]  insights but I'm always on the alert and and vigilant because you know because
[57:46.060 --> 57:51.620]  we're so so vulnerable we're so much involved around the world all kinds of
[57:51.620 --> 57:56.780]  things could break loose and and overnight the political or the economic
[57:56.780 --> 58:00.100]  environment could change rather quickly well it's like Rahm Emanuel said the
[58:00.100 --> 58:03.860]  Wall Street Journal he said we don't want to let a good crisis go to waste so
[58:03.860 --> 58:08.660]  created or opportunistically used what about the economic terrorism back in
[58:08.660 --> 58:11.780]  October they said give us unlimited power in the banking are there's going
[58:11.780 --> 58:16.660]  to be a depression in the stock market bunch 777 points is that not economic
[58:16.660 --> 58:21.900]  terrorism yeah it is and if it doesn't have enough fear and put enough fear in
[58:21.900 --> 58:26.060]  the heart of the people they'll create the fear because people succumb and they
[58:26.060 --> 58:29.460]  give up their liberties when they're very fearful so that's what we have to
[58:29.460 --> 58:32.660]  convince the people that they should not be doing is sacrificing their
[58:32.660 --> 58:36.260]  liberties for their security congressman I know you have a vote coming up any

[1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:36.420]  minutes to get to the floor bang so Ron Paul is running down the house
[1:00:36.420 --> 1:00:41.620]  corridors the capital corridors right now to get there you know that happens a
[1:00:41.620 --> 1:00:45.860]  lot with congressman when they're in session is that it happens about half
[1:00:45.860 --> 1:00:49.260]  the time they say they'll be on in the third hour they're on the first or they
[1:00:49.260 --> 1:00:52.780]  say they're on the first hour they're on the fourth but Ron Paul always comes
[1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:57.340]  through and so next week I'll be able to ask my big row of important questions
[1:00:57.340 --> 1:01:01.380]  but I think that little 10-minute pop-in from the congressman I wanted to ask
[1:01:01.380 --> 1:01:08.420]  him about Rand Paul's campaign coming up with the Senate I wanted to talk to him

[1:08:01.100 --> 1:08:20.780]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:26.140]  by the way I keep getting hundreds and hundreds of emails and web calls saying who am I talking to
[1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:31.540]  sometimes I come in at the start of the show or start of a segment and I'm
[1:08:31.540 --> 1:08:35.860]  talking to John in Minnesota or I'm talking to my crew in there I have an
[1:08:35.860 --> 1:08:41.580]  intercom to Minnesota an intercom out into the control room in there and so I
[1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:45.900]  want to check and see if a caller is still there because I see something going
[1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:51.300]  on with the phone lines I'll go oh hey and I'll hit the talk back button and
[1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:56.100]  then you can't hear me and I'll ask him is the caller still there or is that
[1:08:56.100 --> 1:09:02.140]  guest there or something like that because people keep making a much ado
[1:09:02.140 --> 1:09:08.300]  about nothing about what's he doing let's lip read I was asking if Rod was
[1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:15.420]  still there from Florida but see when I had talked back you can't hear but my
[1:09:15.420 --> 1:09:20.900]  crew can't hear me so that's what you're seeing at prisonplanet.tv for all
[1:09:20.900 --> 1:09:25.540]  the viewers out there okay I want to continue with your calls now but I'm
[1:09:25.540 --> 1:09:31.660]  gonna go back to Rod but I want to answer his question he says I want to see
[1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:35.500]  more solutions I want to hear more solutions that there's something very
[1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:40.020]  elementary here not just that we constantly at nauseam talk about
[1:09:40.020 --> 1:09:44.420]  solutions I mean if people don't hear the solutions they got wax filling their
[1:09:44.420 --> 1:09:50.660]  ears or something or corks in their ears headphones on I mean I don't know but
[1:09:50.660 --> 1:09:54.980]  it's like blaring hip-hop music with the whole building shaking and somebody
[1:09:54.980 --> 1:10:03.860]  says I don't hear any music in the windows or I mean it's like living
[1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:08.300]  downtown in 6th Street over a bar at night and you can't even these people
[1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:12.540]  move move downtown and they move in over bars and then they complain about the
[1:10:12.540 --> 1:10:18.020]  bars anyways it's like I moved over a bar in the bar district I don't know why
[1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:23.220]  I'm hearing this but he's asking about solutions and so I'm gonna give him a
[1:10:23.220 --> 1:10:25.860]  chance to give us the solutions because so often people that say give us
[1:10:25.860 --> 1:10:30.260]  solutions they don't have solutions but I bet Rod a nice guy in Florida I bet he
[1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:34.980]  does I will tell you what we don't give you is easy cooker cookie cutter ones
[1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:38.580]  instant ratification drive through the Wendy's drive through the Burger King
[1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:42.060]  drive through the Sonic drive through the McDonald's and get the food in one
[1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:45.220]  minute and you see the men and women sitting there stamping their feet and
[1:10:45.220 --> 1:10:48.180]  getting mad because there's five cars in front of them and they got to wait two
[1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:55.380]  minutes at McDonald's to get some GMO all we talk about is solutions and the
[1:10:55.380 --> 1:10:58.900]  biggest one is exposing the globalist and how they operate and how they work
[1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:01.980]  and how they've got us all turned against each other and how they use race
[1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:08.660]  to divide us in the name of fighting racism all their tricks on display
[1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:12.220]  teaching people how the system works showing people how to think for
[1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:19.140]  themselves all of that is a side issue to the central one with the Hegelian
[1:11:19.140 --> 1:11:27.340]  dialectic of problem reaction solution the Hegelian dialectic of problem
[1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:31.500]  reaction solution they create the crisis and they hype it up and say what is
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:36.300]  somebody gonna do there's a crisis there's a problem it's bad what are we
[1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:39.180]  gonna do and then they have their people come out and say the solution is
[1:11:39.180 --> 1:11:43.100]  this something the public would have never accepted before but if they frame
[1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:47.620]  it like the public wants it we want a solution we want Congress to get
[1:11:47.620 --> 1:11:52.180]  something done when the founders wanted separation of powers and said gridlock
[1:11:52.180 --> 1:11:55.540]  was good because if you don't have gridlock you're gonna get a tyranny 100% of
[1:11:55.540 --> 1:12:00.700]  the time what government off your back so they set up a system where it all be
[1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:04.580]  tied up and it was an incredible engine of liberty and freedom that it
[1:12:04.580 --> 1:12:11.020]  unleashed so you hear this about solutions and these politicians will come
[1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:15.700]  in there and they'll give you oh it's so easy I'm gonna get you a car and a job
[1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:19.380]  and no more problems if you just vote for me and then six eight months into the
[1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:25.620]  administration it's hell on earth I'm gonna keep you safe from al-qaeda then
[1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:28.900]  you find out the whole homeland security systems for you and your family and was
[1:12:28.900 --> 1:12:31.820]  designed from the beginning to suppress the American people and offshore
[1:12:31.820 --> 1:12:36.540]  corporate takeover it's the straight jacket to make sure you can't resist and
[1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:39.620]  get control of your government legitimately and to call dissent
[1:12:39.620 --> 1:12:43.420]  terrorism and homeland security documents saying if you want to audit the Fed
[1:12:43.420 --> 1:12:48.540]  you're a terrorist well I guess 51% say abolish the Fed outright and what is it
[1:12:48.540 --> 1:12:54.660]  over 70 plus percent think it needs to be investigated well you got 20 some
[1:12:54.660 --> 1:12:58.180]  percent that are still mind-numb robots and they're all the ones sucking their
[1:12:58.180 --> 1:13:03.180]  thumbs calling us the kooks look at how far we've come look at the success that
[1:13:03.180 --> 1:13:05.620]  we've had
[1:13:12.820 --> 1:13:21.700]  the American people are waking up in a big big way every single day ladies and
[1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:29.820]  gentlemen and I am just so excited about what's going on and what's
[1:13:29.820 --> 1:13:38.500]  happening and nine times out of ten when I see people complaining they're on the
[1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:40.860]  web they're on YouTube they're on the message boards they're emailing me
[1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:46.580]  they're calling and saying meanly a lot of times not like Rod why don't you do
[1:13:46.580 --> 1:13:51.300]  more why don't you have more solutions or you're not doing it right you're not
[1:13:51.300 --> 1:13:57.220]  you know effective enough I believe me I know I'm not perfect but I'm in a fight
[1:13:57.220 --> 1:14:03.260]  I'm being assaulted by a technocratic eugenicist scientific dictatorship I
[1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:10.180]  am resisting it with my humanity in any fight you're not gonna be perfect not
[1:14:10.180 --> 1:14:14.100]  even the best prize fighter not even the best ultimate fighting championship not
[1:14:14.100 --> 1:14:17.820]  the best Greco-Roman wrestler they're not perfect ladies and gentlemen and I
[1:14:17.820 --> 1:14:22.140]  don't claim to be some expert at this I'm somebody taking action and so we
[1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:26.220]  spend all our time talking about how we need to talk about more solutions and
[1:14:26.220 --> 1:14:31.780]  how we do things better instead of taking action and getting involved and I
[1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:35.140]  see so many other people that spend all their time critiquing others instead of
[1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:39.260]  being leaders themselves but when somebody tells me we're not talking about
[1:14:39.260 --> 1:14:42.740]  solutions when we say the state's rights movement when we talk about taking over
[1:14:42.740 --> 1:14:46.620]  our local counties and cities we talk about pushing to get voting integrity
[1:14:46.620 --> 1:14:50.300]  when we talk about exposing false flag terror so governments lose that favorite
[1:14:50.300 --> 1:14:54.180]  problem-reaction solution system when we realize that they create crises and
[1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:57.740]  then offer their solutions that are never what they claim they're for but to
[1:14:57.740 --> 1:15:02.500]  get more control and vertically integrate the economy this is a long
[1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:08.580]  hard societal cultural process we've become domesticated poisoned dumb down
[1:15:08.580 --> 1:15:14.580]  and turned into a bunch of scum myself included we have to pull out of this it
[1:15:14.580 --> 1:15:21.100]  is a struggle it is not just boom easy people like well you know I want to see
[1:15:21.100 --> 1:15:24.380]  a solution with a fellow reserve what do you think it is to audit it people say
[1:15:24.380 --> 1:15:27.780]  well I want to hear what the solution is once we audit it Ron Paul's introduce
[1:15:27.780 --> 1:15:31.860]  bills of how to replace it he has a bill a bunch of sponsors to abolish it and a
[1:15:31.860 --> 1:15:36.060]  plan and there's a bunch of other great plans in different debates about a gold
[1:15:36.060 --> 1:15:41.620]  back or a government fiat back or a partially gold or silver back or
[1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:46.180]  different monetization systems or a different comprehensive annual financial
[1:15:46.180 --> 1:15:50.700]  investment system for dividends like Alaska has where citizens get paid off
[1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:54.300]  of tax money investment that's how much wealth the globalists created for
[1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:57.620]  themselves we could have been all paid they don't want us to get that so they
[1:15:57.620 --> 1:16:02.180]  took the money bankrupted by design once they put it in real assets I mean I
[1:16:02.180 --> 1:16:06.700]  just give solution after solution don't take the vaccines that's a big solution
[1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:11.020]  warn your neighbors not to take them tell police and firemen and medical workers
[1:16:11.020 --> 1:16:14.940]  that are being ordered to take it that there's no law they don't have to and in
[1:16:14.940 --> 1:16:19.620]  2002 we said no to the model states health emergency powers act 14 million
[1:16:19.620 --> 1:16:24.380]  first responders told to take it 4,000 took it a bunch of them died Tommy
[1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:27.300]  Thompson wouldn't even take it had a human health and services they
[1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:35.260]  suspended the program huge victory absolute solution hardcore info I mean
[1:16:35.260 --> 1:16:39.580]  you know they had a bill where the CPS in Texas could take your children no
[1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:45.260]  judge no jury not even a fake order take your medical records computerized them
[1:16:45.260 --> 1:16:49.180]  all what they've already done under other guys's use it no more anything we
[1:16:49.180 --> 1:16:53.620]  beat the bill just hundreds of solutions hundreds of fights we beat the
[1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:57.380]  trans-Texas corridor three times first they came out and announced they had it
[1:16:57.380 --> 1:17:01.140]  and then said it was a great thing and then we said we didn't want it so they
[1:17:01.140 --> 1:17:05.140]  said you're crazy it doesn't exist and we said don't try that Jedi mind trick on
[1:17:05.140 --> 1:17:09.180]  us that game here you are setting it up then they said okay but it's good then
[1:17:09.180 --> 1:17:12.380]  they said they canceled it now they came back and said oh we're just renaming it
[1:17:12.380 --> 1:17:16.820]  we just went and beat it again the legislature I mean we're here swinging
[1:17:16.820 --> 1:17:21.180]  muskets at the Alamo fighting for our lives and there's a bunch of people going
[1:17:21.180 --> 1:17:24.100]  you need to swing your muskets a little bit better up there on the parapet and
[1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:27.300]  you need to give me a little more so I mean I could just go for I think I could
[1:17:27.300 --> 1:17:31.380]  suspend all calls all guest everything and just give you solutions for hundreds
[1:17:31.380 --> 1:17:36.980]  of hours and victories we've had and everything we've done I'll tell you the
[1:17:36.980 --> 1:17:41.100]  solution it's getting up off our big fat butts and taking action against the
[1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:46.620]  new oral order it's getting basic instincts of defending your family never
[1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:50.820]  ratting out your family not trusting the government that's a big fat solution
[1:17:50.820 --> 1:17:56.460]  not complying not going along not giving in becoming Americans again becoming
[1:17:56.460 --> 1:18:03.980]  free people again not being a bunch of trusting gullible jackasses now Rod I
[1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:08.180]  want you to give me solutions right now you're talking to millions of people
[1:18:08.180 --> 1:18:12.860]  buddy you give me solutions well one of the solutions that I had in mind that I
[1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:17.220]  really wanted to talk to Ron Paul about was what do we do when the
[1:18:17.220 --> 1:18:20.420]  hold on just a minute hold on see how you did that again the spirit of
[1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:24.140]  complaining we weren't gonna take calls for Ron Paul I said we're gonna take
[1:18:24.140 --> 1:18:28.860]  calls after Ron Paul you're on the air I wasn't here to do with you you can call
[1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:32.220]  you can send Ron Paul what is that little thing about I mean do we do some
[1:18:32.220 --> 1:18:35.820]  kind of we're not providing a service here I mean I mean what's that statement
[1:18:35.820 --> 1:18:41.140]  there that little that little you know I wanted to talk to Ron Paul it was just
[1:18:41.140 --> 1:18:46.700]  that's what the question was based was based on ball out don't don't get me
[1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:51.380]  wrong I think that if it wasn't for you we'd be back in the Stone Age what I
[1:18:51.380 --> 1:18:55.220]  what I was talking about was very specifics because like for instance with
[1:18:55.220 --> 1:18:59.900]  the the situation that we're in right now the United States everybody is so
[1:18:59.900 --> 1:19:03.500]  dependent upon credit and they're not gonna do anything if they can't have
[1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:07.500]  their Mercedes and they can't have their Harley-Davidson that's why we are held
[1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:12.940]  hostage by these bankers exactly that's my point exactly what I'm as a listener
[1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:15.900]  I'm not trying to say that you're not doing anything because man if it wasn't
[1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:20.820]  for you we'd be we'd be in big trouble big trouble for you if it wasn't for you
[1:19:20.820 --> 1:19:26.380]  Rod it's you you're the power taking action well when I was in the federal
[1:19:26.380 --> 1:19:31.780]  government I was an investigator and I was hired on 912 okay and I saw the
[1:19:31.780 --> 1:19:35.340]  bull that was going on there okay I want to hear about it back I'm gonna quit
[1:19:35.340 --> 1:19:37.700]  interrupting you and then I promise we're gonna get to Scott Phillip Donna

[1:24:16.380 --> 1:24:21.300]  about Obama's plunging approval ratings and what that means the cap and trade a
[1:24:21.300 --> 1:24:25.140]  lot more okay I'm gonna go to Scott Phillip Donna Davey been holding like
[1:24:25.140 --> 1:24:29.180]  champs Rod finish your points you've been trying to make about being a federal
[1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:34.020]  investigator after 9 at 12 go ahead well basically with the question that I
[1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:40.340]  wanted to get to was what do we replace the system with specifically do we print
[1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:44.100]  a new dollar what is that going to do to the countries around the world that are
[1:24:44.100 --> 1:24:48.580]  holding dollars is there a reasonable way when the system is based on fraud and
[1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:52.980]  fraud is a crime who is responsible to be arresting these people who is it
[1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:57.180]  specifically that's what I'm asking about I'm asking about who is actually
[1:24:57.180 --> 1:25:01.780]  specifically in charge to oversee these things so that we can hold these people
[1:25:01.780 --> 1:25:06.300]  accountable I don't know where to go Ron Paul says state grand juries should
[1:25:06.300 --> 1:25:11.260]  start indicting all these people like made-off and others doing investigations
[1:25:11.260 --> 1:25:14.620]  and then after that people can be federally charged or they've been
[1:25:14.620 --> 1:25:18.900]  convicted in the state court clearly there are processes that Ron Paul many
[1:25:18.900 --> 1:25:25.140]  other economists he is an economist not his medical doctor have laid out we can
[1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:29.140]  have a debate about that but we know this group of crooks needs to go you
[1:25:29.140 --> 1:25:34.900]  would some plans over a decade would phase out the current dollar the
[1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:40.100]  Federal Reserve dollar and at the same time would stop issuing as much of it
[1:25:40.100 --> 1:25:43.340]  so that would actually be good for nations holding it and then you'd have
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:49.780]  kind of a dual system as you phased that out you would ban the derivatives these
[1:25:49.780 --> 1:25:56.300]  fraudulent counterfeit instruments they make the banks just make these up you
[1:25:56.300 --> 1:26:00.340]  would restrict fractional reserve banking because this is the false economy
[1:26:00.340 --> 1:26:05.660]  the predatory economy the flim flam economy that is waging war against the
[1:26:05.660 --> 1:26:10.420]  real economy notice the biggest funders of global greenhouse taxes and these
[1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:15.900]  systems are JP Morgan Chase Bank of England shareholders Goldman Sachs
[1:26:15.900 --> 1:26:20.900]  because they're they're parasites they want you bankrupt they want to own you
[1:26:20.900 --> 1:26:26.820]  they are con artist Ponzi scheme operators they got so big they rule the
[1:26:26.820 --> 1:26:31.460]  planet but it's through fraud and so we just point out that they are the real
[1:26:31.460 --> 1:26:34.460]  governments that I'm always looking at Obama or Bush they're like look at my
[1:26:34.460 --> 1:26:38.700]  puppets you know I need to get some little puppets an Obama puppet or have
[1:26:38.700 --> 1:26:42.540]  somebody make one an Obama puppet and a Bush puppet or a McCain puppet look
[1:26:42.540 --> 1:26:45.860]  here's my puppets don't look at me meanwhile here's the new world order up
[1:26:45.860 --> 1:26:50.340]  here we're starting to look past them people they're finding out oh it's the
[1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:54.540]  banks oh it's a new world order and they are getting scared I watched Bernanke
[1:26:54.540 --> 1:26:58.940]  this town hallways at the Kansas City Fed same February tried to arrest my guys
[1:26:58.940 --> 1:27:04.740]  for being 200 yards away at a World War one memorial just crazy video on the web
[1:27:04.740 --> 1:27:10.740]  that's in the new film by the way and our clip of it ish and Bernanke scared up
[1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:14.300]  there look they've lost the arrogance they should go into Congress and Congress
[1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:18.900]  was like my god a god just came in and now it's a crook what are you doing it's
[1:27:18.900 --> 1:27:23.100]  over for them they can and they're gonna they're gonna pull scams but I mean you
[1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:27.020]  ask what do we replace it with the Constitution it has provisions for all
[1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:33.740]  of that I see that and but one of the things that as a listener and that's
[1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:39.780]  really all I'm I'm I'm trying to to say here is as a listener I'm trying to get
[1:27:39.780 --> 1:27:43.420]  up my own ideas as to what I can go and do and I get those from you I get them
[1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:48.900]  from a lot of other people and I've already exercised my abilities I've
[1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:52.780]  contacted my congressman I've contacted my representatives I was the Alaska
[1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:55.940]  State coordinator for we the people of Bob Schultz and that's how I initially
[1:27:55.940 --> 1:28:00.500]  got in touch with Ron Paul back in 99 I was a federal investigator I resigned
[1:28:00.500 --> 1:28:04.620]  due to corruptions and some other things you know I've done everything that I
[1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:10.220]  can do as a person that I think of to do this but yet it's still going on so I
[1:28:10.220 --> 1:28:14.900]  see your fight I'm trying to participate in the fight and what I think we got to
[1:28:14.900 --> 1:28:20.300]  do is really look into the possibility of citizens arrest because under the
[1:28:20.300 --> 1:28:25.660]  Constitution it's clear that is in the Constitution and the people created the
[1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:29.700]  counties and cities and states and so that's why a city is a corporation it's
[1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:34.260]  so-called self-rule now the mayors and police forces are owned by the unions
[1:28:34.260 --> 1:28:37.700]  and the offshore banks most of them don't even know it and so it's in us
[1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:42.020]  against them they're sucking off us it it's the parasite it's like the thing in
[1:28:42.020 --> 1:28:46.060]  the movie alien that attaches to your face and lays the new older egg we got
[1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:50.740]  to get it off our face and so instead of always trying to find a magic bullet or
[1:28:50.740 --> 1:28:53.900]  something that brings the whole elephant down you got to just go in
[1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:58.260]  discredit the system until nobody supports it I appreciate your call
[1:28:58.260 --> 1:29:06.780]  Scott in Texas go ahead Scott how's going on Worldwide Transmission I hear

[1:29:23.780 --> 1:29:26.940]  happening right under our noses and the evidence is right there but my question
[1:29:26.940 --> 1:29:31.020]  is we talk about fighting the New World Order and exposing the secret government
[1:29:31.020 --> 1:29:33.780]  and spreading the word and all this I never hear anybody talking about the
[1:29:33.780 --> 1:29:37.420]  reasons why these elite factions feel it necessary to congregate these
[1:29:37.420 --> 1:29:41.060]  organizations and secretly plan all of our futures I'd stay there you're making

[1:39:26.180 --> 1:39:30.340]  finish up yeah well basically what I was getting at is it's finding out the why
[1:39:30.340 --> 1:39:34.380]  behind all these everything that you're following all those groups absolutely
[1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:37.500]  it's happening it's undeniable it's indisputable but I was trying to get as
[1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:41.260]  to the why I mean let's face it most of us growing up especially these days are
[1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:44.300]  brought up to distrust politicians and world leaders because they seem to only
[1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:49.060]  have the interest of a very few elite at heart but I mean did it ever occur to
[1:39:49.060 --> 1:39:53.500]  anyone that the bulk of us population in fact the world population for that
[1:39:53.500 --> 1:39:56.580]  matter does not have a mental capacity to deal with some of the difficult
[1:39:56.580 --> 1:40:03.340]  decisions that need to be made on a very grand scale what do you think it what
[1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:09.660]  are you getting at sir I based on what I'm getting at is I don't necessarily
[1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:15.020]  agree with I agree with everything that you're saying everything is happening the
[1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:19.500]  way you say it's happening my question is playing devil's advocate here is are
[1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:22.940]  we sure that this isn't a good thing are we not preparing for something bigger do
[1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:26.500]  we know why they feel it necessary to try to govern our lives as they may be
[1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:31.820]  it's good to take the third world children and deal with them for their own
[1:40:31.820 --> 1:40:40.700]  good right give them a Colombian necktie no no no no I'm not going that
[1:40:40.700 --> 1:40:45.500]  direction for the earth because maybe the elites are the elites because they
[1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:49.100]  know something we don't and maybe it's sad but they're willing to do the tough
[1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:53.420]  things that's that's their attitude and so sorry about having to kill all these
[1:40:53.420 --> 1:40:59.180]  people but somebody's got to do it and even think about their RFID chip which
[1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:04.380]  is come to me my child well and that's an excellent way for them to track
[1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:09.420]  everyone's worth and I mean I've seen the interviews with Aaron Russo and you
[1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:12.940]  know everything you guys did there and I mean it's although they talk about it as
[1:41:12.940 --> 1:41:18.540]  that they played off as a means to secure currency transactions to
[1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:21.940]  secure your ID all that kind of stuff it that there's so many other functions
[1:41:21.940 --> 1:41:25.260]  that can they can use it for and that's basically your overall worth is tracked
[1:41:25.260 --> 1:41:27.380]  and just like they said if they don't like what you're doing they shut it off
[1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:32.780]  but when it's on they know where your relative spot in humanity is based on
[1:41:32.780 --> 1:41:37.420]  your value on your RFID and we have these little carbon blobs these third
[1:41:37.420 --> 1:41:41.540]  world people are hurting the earth because the carbon dioxide is deadly
[1:41:41.540 --> 1:41:45.980]  poison they exhale I mean everything the globalists say is a lie they're
[1:41:45.980 --> 1:41:49.460]  control freaks and they claim they don't want nukes spreading but they hand them
[1:41:49.460 --> 1:41:53.020]  out they claim that genetic engineering cross species is dangerous they're the
[1:41:53.020 --> 1:41:56.260]  ones doing it you know they're the ones engaging in all the experiments they're
[1:41:56.260 --> 1:42:00.380]  the ones dumping toxic waste they're the ones throwing nuclear reactors in the
[1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:05.900]  black sea I mean they consistently are doing all this bad stuff and then
[1:42:05.900 --> 1:42:11.020]  always calling for more power out of the crises they've created and you can
[1:42:11.020 --> 1:42:14.140]  argue that some areas of the earth or could be overpopulated some of these
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:17.260]  mega cities and that some of the technologies are dirty but they're
[1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:21.100]  suppressing the clean technologies and then they say oh well we're euthanizing
[1:42:21.100 --> 1:42:25.140]  and sterilizing and poisoning the third world to call their numbers but when you
[1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:29.460]  find out they actually said in the Royal Commission in 49 we're gonna let their
[1:42:29.460 --> 1:42:35.300]  numbers explode to tie them down and then we'll call them off later as part of
[1:42:35.300 --> 1:42:42.340]  another operation so it's it's it's very very sick and not everyone is
[1:42:42.340 --> 1:42:45.660]  admitting there's a Bilderberg group I've got Chris Matthews basically following
[1:42:45.660 --> 1:42:49.460]  White House talking point saying we're all insane and I'm gonna play a clip of
[1:42:49.460 --> 1:42:54.580]  it later I meant to yesterday we're all insane and crazy and you know and if we
[1:42:54.580 --> 1:43:00.500]  believe in Bilderberg group we're nuts and they got a go from the Politico
[1:43:00.500 --> 1:43:05.380]  saying this when Politico's done reports admitting it's real and they're calling
[1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:07.780]  for world government and then meanwhile there's hundreds and hundreds of news
[1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:12.260]  articles a month calling for a world government to save us from the devilish
[1:43:12.260 --> 1:43:17.060]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe that is you know just so deadly it's it's
[1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:22.780]  scarier than a body snatcher the globalist are control freaks Hitler was
[1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:26.860]  killing all those people saying there wasn't living space and they had to make
[1:43:26.860 --> 1:43:30.740]  living she was an environmentalist he was a vegetarian and I'm not saying
[1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:33.620]  about all environmentalist or vegetarians are bad but I'm saying the
[1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:37.420]  environmental movement was founded by the Rockefellers on record and they
[1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:41.300]  set it up to teach us that humans were bad so they could have all the land and
[1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:46.180]  property you understand it's neo feudalism and serfdom that when England
[1:43:46.180 --> 1:43:54.540]  had maybe 500,000 people in it you know 800 900 years ago in all of southern
[1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:57.980]  England you know which was the main kingdom that they were saying it was
[1:43:57.980 --> 1:44:02.260]  overpopulated then and people were kept on tiny pieces of land at starvation
[1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:07.540]  level as a tool of control I mean do you want to be the one to go maybe there
[1:44:07.540 --> 1:44:13.140]  are too many people go ahead and inject that child with the HIV I mean that's
[1:44:13.140 --> 1:44:18.380]  no different than taking a dagger and just plunging it into somebody's heart
[1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:24.420]  anything else about population control pardon me is that what everything is
[1:44:24.420 --> 1:44:27.500]  about it I mean it does all boil down to population control mean the whole
[1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:32.700]  and I've now read most of the 1100 page book and the last four weeks since we
[1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:37.580]  pushed it out and you know really broke it nationally the eco science textbook
[1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:43.020]  written by the wild house science are is the complete plan weather modifications
[1:44:43.020 --> 1:44:47.220]  to kill the crops you can't eat for sterilization CPS taking all children
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:51.860]  at birth giant communal living centers that the kids are brought up in that's
[1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:56.220]  what China does they signed a deal with the globalist to be made the global
[1:44:56.220 --> 1:45:01.820]  superpower if they do this I mean they mean business pal yes that's what it's
[1:45:01.820 --> 1:45:05.100]  about and look I want to tell the yuppies this a lot of them think they're
[1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:08.340]  part of the elite you're not getting exempt from the chem trail from the
[1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:12.420]  sodium fluoride from the mercury from the agitants from all of this you're
[1:45:12.420 --> 1:45:16.620]  getting hit too so you may want to slaughter these people it's some greedy
[1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:20.660]  primitive level some tribal level you don't understand the pies limitless and
[1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:26.940]  we can always expand it and that we're meant to push off to the stars a life
[1:45:26.940 --> 1:45:31.300]  creating terraforming species it's gonna be awesome we can just get past these
[1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:35.420]  control freaks and these and these malfunctioning cancers I mean that's
[1:45:35.420 --> 1:45:39.380]  what these elite humans are that the elite call themselves elite special
[1:45:39.380 --> 1:45:44.740]  species that Google elite will split into separate species guys BBC within
[1:45:44.740 --> 1:45:49.420]  bragging how they're already a super species yeah they're a super degenerate
[1:45:49.420 --> 1:45:53.460]  species I mean it's like a bed bug or fleas or something I mean there's
[1:45:53.460 --> 1:45:58.460]  nothing special they don't have the true vision and love of life and that's
[1:45:58.460 --> 1:46:04.020]  disgusting and they use our love of life to deeper to to to to to disinform to
[1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:09.340]  to program us to deprogram us from our natural programming and give us a false
[1:46:09.340 --> 1:46:14.380]  program you know they take our love and say be loving kill yourself it's for
[1:46:14.380 --> 1:46:20.980]  earth oh I mean you see how sick this is okay well it's clear I'm not getting to
[1:46:20.980 --> 1:46:24.140]  you listen I probably your call listen I appreciate your call I gotta move on to
[1:46:24.140 --> 1:46:29.500]  others I if you think the earth may be overpopulated and you're calling from
[1:46:29.500 --> 1:46:33.660]  Texas there's lots of high cliffs in the area and I don't want you to kill
[1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:38.660]  yourself but before you make that decision and support policies that are
[1:46:38.660 --> 1:46:41.860]  killing our kids and killing our women and killing our men and killing the
[1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:45.260]  third world because they can really get away with the soft kill weapons on wider
[1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:49.060]  scale in the third world before you do that you should go to Africa go to
[1:46:49.060 --> 1:46:56.860]  Latin America look at these little kids in the eyes and then you know kill
[1:46:56.860 --> 1:47:00.180]  yourself I mean I don't want you to kill yourself but before you kill somebody
[1:47:00.180 --> 1:47:04.340]  or before you support this passively because it's some primitive level it
[1:47:04.340 --> 1:47:08.780]  gives you a power chip of oh god that feels powerful to kill people oh yes you
[1:47:08.780 --> 1:47:14.780]  know before you get into that mode show yourself the door pal now I know you're
[1:47:14.780 --> 1:47:18.260]  not really saying that but I mean to those that extrapolate out that that
[1:47:18.260 --> 1:47:22.580]  view I mean I tell Holdren I tell Kissinger I tell them all I wish I'm
[1:47:22.580 --> 1:47:28.100]  no harm I wish they'd wake up get their souls back well how is it moral that we
[1:47:28.100 --> 1:47:32.540]  need to die but evil if we say they need to commit suicide I mean I tell Dr.
[1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:43.340]  Pianca UT buddy nobody stopping you nobody stopping you pal me I want every
[1:47:43.340 --> 1:47:47.300]  moment of life I'm gonna be like Darth Vader I'm gonna try everything I can to
[1:47:47.300 --> 1:47:50.700]  stay alive as long as possible that's moral I'm not gonna take Chinese slaves
[1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:56.300]  organs though to do it coming up I'm gonna go over this Chris Matthews
[1:47:56.300 --> 1:47:59.780]  psychology it's very important start of the next hour let's go ahead and talk
[1:47:59.780 --> 1:48:05.620]  to Philip in Tennessee Philip you're on the air hey Alex I'd like to touch on a
[1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:11.020]  news brief at our CBS channel to Chicago the police are now gonna shoot at
[1:48:11.020 --> 1:48:17.060]  fleeing cars yes no due process and you only have to be suspected of committing
[1:48:17.060 --> 1:48:21.180]  a felony they passed the law that the police can force you out of your house
[1:48:21.180 --> 1:48:25.300]  with without a warrant or anything now they got rid of the castle doctrine here
[1:48:25.300 --> 1:48:29.300]  to you in the name of hurricane evacuation but it's wider no it's total
[1:48:29.300 --> 1:48:33.620]  tyranny is now happening mm-hmm yeah well I I knew you hadn't touched on you
[1:48:33.620 --> 1:48:36.980]  probably have a large stack of the news to get on your day I'm glad you brought
[1:48:36.980 --> 1:48:41.180]  that up because because it's painful to go through these stacks and I've got to
[1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:45.340]  make myself in fact our producers make me do 30 minutes every day or I just at
[1:48:45.340 --> 1:48:49.180]  least read the headlines and folks can think what they want about it yeah that's
[1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:53.740]  CBS and the army is gonna be involved as well they're gonna gun us down it's all
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:58.460]  part of freedom well just want to do make sure your listeners could Google that
[1:48:58.460 --> 1:49:02.980]  I'm sorry do a start page search on that the CBS Chicago local police deadly
[1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:07.660]  force they change their policy they now do not need to be under attack with the
[1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:13.380]  vehicle to open fire so no they're just gonna no no exactly we're dead I mean
[1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:18.620]  it look when you read Pentagon documents from the 50s and 60s they said we got to
[1:49:18.620 --> 1:49:23.780]  train the troops and police to kill citizens how do we and then after Ken
[1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:27.540]  state they said how do we train them we train the public and the police at the
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:32.860]  same time we give them soft kill weapons they're called less lethal as their
[1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:37.140]  true name and there's the headline Chicago area new policy last week to
[1:49:37.140 --> 1:49:42.900]  shoot at fleeing cars and it says yeah they don't have to be in danger they're
[1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:48.540]  going to murder you give you try to leave and and next it's gonna be you
[1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:52.020]  didn't pull over quick enough so I killed you or next you didn't know the police
[1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:55.460]  car was behind you so they're gonna shoot you and and there's this cult of
[1:49:55.460 --> 1:49:59.860]  just worshiping police and running around behind them and loving them and
[1:49:59.860 --> 1:50:06.780]  thanking them and it's very sick and the Chicago police are a murdering Mafia
[1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:10.980]  they're allowed to beat up women at bars you don't give them more drinks on TV and
[1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:14.540]  don't get in trouble I mean it's just total Mafia run Aaron Rizzo talks about
[1:50:14.540 --> 1:50:21.940]  that in his in the reflections and warnings and I mean I've got the
[1:50:21.940 --> 1:50:24.660]  Houston police chief saying they want to put cameras in everyone's homes with
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:28.700]  straight faces I had the Bergen County police chief on their police chiefs in
[1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:32.340]  New Jersey over counties and he said I'm want to make everyone take a chip in
[1:50:32.340 --> 1:50:37.260]  the county I mean you know anything else sir do a great job Alex I
[1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:42.020]  appreciate your call I'm glad you called about that human race will split into

[1:54:29.500 --> 1:54:34.340]  kill you and then it's in the mainstream news they're training to have heavy
[1:54:34.340 --> 1:54:39.780]  machine guns set up at army checkpoints at the military bases and now they're
[1:54:39.780 --> 1:54:45.020]  doing drills out on the highways drills where they have the citizens fighting
[1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:49.540]  back calling us terrorists they're drilling to fight us and just like Iraq
[1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:53.620]  you don't stop at a checkpoint and it's come out many times people aren't paying
[1:54:53.620 --> 1:54:57.540]  attention or whatever they just kill you and the police are just it's been
[1:54:57.540 --> 1:55:01.340]  announced CBS News see I should have opened the show with that I should have
[1:55:01.340 --> 1:55:08.180]  opened the show with scores of White House openly funded and openly run I
[1:55:08.180 --> 1:55:14.540]  mean these are direct members of his of the White House are now writing hit pieces
[1:55:14.540 --> 1:55:18.700]  on me I mean it's folks it's scary I kind of look at my kids every day and go man
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:23.300]  I sure enjoy life like a bird flies by that pretty I and I just enjoy
[1:55:23.300 --> 1:55:26.620]  everything because I'm not even really worried about I'm killing me but I'm
[1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:30.100]  kind of like man I wanted to do some more fishing or more hiking or I wanted
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:33.940]  to see this or see that and I'm not even saying that's gonna happen but I mean
[1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:38.100]  there's a big article up on prison planet calm where left-wing website with
[1:55:38.100 --> 1:55:41.340]  direct ties to White House smears Alex Jones I mean they're coming after me
[1:55:41.340 --> 1:55:45.180]  because they know I'm standing up to him but what am I supposed to do you know
[1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:49.180]  at a fundamental level I want to tell the globalist I wish you'd wake up and
[1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:53.180]  stop being evil but I mean I can't let you put carbon taxes on me I can't let
[1:55:53.180 --> 1:55:57.180]  you take my guns I can't let you carry out eugenics and your White House
[1:55:57.180 --> 1:56:01.540]  science chief says he wants to take all our kids I mean you know oh I mean what
[1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:09.220]  am I supposed to do we have a right to stand up and say no to you and I know a
[1:56:09.220 --> 1:56:11.940]  lot of people that work for the White House are not completely evil and
[1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:15.820]  immoral most of you are in the same boat as I am and the minute you realize
[1:56:15.820 --> 1:56:19.100]  that we're all in this together and there's less than 6,000 superclass
[1:56:19.100 --> 1:56:23.620]  running this whole system I don't understand why you're being part of this
[1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:27.340]  and I don't know how you death threat people and I don't know how you do all
[1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:31.460]  the things you do and I don't know how you create fake clan groups and get them
[1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:36.020]  to blow up buildings and you know kill your own federal officers I just you're
[1:56:36.020 --> 1:56:40.020]  evil you're bad and to you that you're beyond good new all we have to do all
[1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:43.500]  these evil things because the injustice defies the means and all this Mackey of
[1:56:43.500 --> 1:56:50.260]  alien bull but I mean it's getting creepy folks when every couple days open
[1:56:50.260 --> 1:56:55.140]  George Soros funded publications and open White House and open acorn groups
[1:56:55.140 --> 1:57:03.500]  openly are attacking me me I mean I guess I am kind of one of the big chief
[1:57:03.500 --> 1:57:06.940]  leaders of this whole fight I guess I'm the most radical and the most focused
[1:57:06.940 --> 1:57:12.860]  and the most hardcore and I'm not even up to this I can't even believe I'm in
[1:57:12.860 --> 1:57:20.180]  this position I just am not laying down to these people so I'll try to cover
[1:57:20.180 --> 1:57:29.100]  that later I mean this is really starting to creep me out folks and they're
[1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:36.260]  trying to say I'm a terrorist and stuff all because I'll read a CBS news story
[1:57:36.260 --> 1:57:40.940]  where they're gonna and I point out hey shooting at a fleeing car shooting at
[1:57:40.940 --> 1:57:46.500]  people at checkpoints that's martial law I mean that's the most hardcore that's
[1:57:46.500 --> 1:57:51.740]  a 10 on the Richter scale you know every it's exponential and I said back in
[1:57:51.740 --> 1:57:57.860]  1999 we were at a 3.3 I've said we're about a 6 stuff like this is bringing
[1:57:57.860 --> 1:58:03.820]  us up to a 7 and then when you go to a 10 that is house by house grid by grid
[1:58:03.820 --> 1:58:09.340]  taking America over taking your guns and death camps and and lining people up
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:13.020]  and shooting them and this is what happened in Germany the Germans morally
[1:58:13.020 --> 1:58:16.620]  were much more moral than the American people and look what Hitler did with
[1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:21.180]  their minds and and got them into evil step-by-step camels nose under the tent
[1:58:21.180 --> 1:58:24.940]  flap same thing with the Russians very moral people look what they did under

[2:01:41.740 --> 2:01:44.780]  like if there's enough field at night with a couple big pits in it and you
[2:01:44.780 --> 2:01:48.260]  finally get a flashlight and see the pit it's kind of scary that I almost walked

[2:01:51.460 --> 2:01:59.100]  oh definitely but I don't know are we too late well we are too late for the
[2:01:59.100 --> 2:02:05.060]  going so fast we are too late for the 50 I'm sorry go ahead it seems like it's

[2:02:08.780 --> 2:02:14.260]  changing and if you don't like giving up all your freedoms and being shot at
[2:02:14.260 --> 2:02:18.780]  checkpoints you don't like black people see that's the mindless propaganda of
[2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:24.380]  don't be racist let us let us make you slaves but it's not working people are
[2:02:24.380 --> 2:02:30.260]  waking up but it is too late for 51 million babies killed the last 35 years

[2:02:34.420 --> 2:02:38.380]  troops and the million dead Iraqis but it's not too late to stand up and do
[2:02:38.380 --> 2:02:41.460]  the right thing and that's all that matters even if we've been involved in
[2:02:41.460 --> 2:02:46.100]  evil some of us all of us have done bad things it's never too late to turn it
[2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:50.620]  around and so no ma'am it's not too late did you hear Ron Paul earlier about

[2:03:15.820 --> 2:03:25.420]  making copies yes if a million people did that and gave out 200 DVDs and even
[2:03:25.420 --> 2:03:29.140]  half of those people paid it forward made other copies we would reach
[2:03:29.140 --> 2:03:33.260]  everybody in the country in a few months you do the math so what you've done you
[2:03:33.260 --> 2:03:37.660]  don't have to do everything call in the talk radio put up a website go to city

[2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:50.780]  depend on it but you know we don't believe in miracles we depend on them my
[2:08:50.780 --> 2:08:54.660]  aunt's got a little thing hanging in one of her rooms that says that we we don't
[2:08:54.660 --> 2:08:59.100]  just believe in Providence we depend on it go ahead Donna finish up your point
[2:08:59.100 --> 2:09:05.500]  just wanted to say that I do fear for your life and I will pray for you well I
[2:09:05.500 --> 2:09:09.260]  appreciate that because you know I it's not a game it's not a joke I've been
[2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:12.780]  attacked I get a lot of death threats and it's creepy to have the White House
[2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:16.980]  looking at us have national news attacking us routinely have a lot of
[2:09:16.980 --> 2:09:19.860]  other stuff I don't want to get into on air but we know we're doing the right
[2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:23.820]  thing and we do it cheerfully and I only bring it up because by exposing what
[2:09:23.820 --> 2:09:28.780]  they're doing that makes it hard for him to do it and so that's why I stay out
[2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:34.340]  in the open and stay prominent it's just creepy but it's also creepy because as I
[2:09:34.340 --> 2:09:39.500]  get more sophisticated and as I get more understanding I don't even hate them
[2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:44.380]  anymore at a primitive level I'm more freaked out by them and more my god you
[2:09:44.380 --> 2:09:48.500]  know these are lunatics they're smart they're intelligent they're focused but
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:54.340]  they're just wicked savage hard control freaks who coldly manipulate human
[2:09:54.340 --> 2:10:01.900]  emotion and psyche and just do such horrible things and the only reason I
[2:10:01.900 --> 2:10:04.900]  don't want to be set up or imprisoned that's probably what they'll try to do
[2:10:04.900 --> 2:10:10.660]  or killed is really I have work I want to continue my only fear is I have a I
[2:10:10.660 --> 2:10:15.500]  want to be here to protect my children I want to be here to and it sounds
[2:10:15.500 --> 2:10:19.340]  corny to those that are worldly and very fleshful but I really just want to be
[2:10:19.340 --> 2:10:24.340]  here to help and I want to be here to stand up against bullies but I know
[2:10:24.340 --> 2:10:26.820]  there's a lot of other people that are standing up against bullies and that's
[2:10:26.820 --> 2:10:30.980]  what matters I just can't believe that this type of scum Donna run our lives
[2:10:30.980 --> 2:10:35.660]  and I can't believe this bad dream just can't end I mean do you get where I'm
[2:10:35.660 --> 2:10:42.620]  going with this I'm scared to death now and I was oblivious two weeks ago how
[2:10:42.620 --> 2:10:48.100]  did you wake up what happened saw the Obama deception and then I've given it
[2:10:48.100 --> 2:10:51.940]  out and it's not convincing everybody and that's what scares me and I'm
[2:10:51.940 --> 2:10:57.460]  thinking what more do I need to get to convince you they still think you know
[2:10:57.460 --> 2:11:03.980]  the government won't do that to us well sure they will well did you hear me
[2:11:03.980 --> 2:11:11.340]  talk about the Stockholm syndrome yes I mean that's what happens the average
[2:11:11.340 --> 2:11:16.500]  person man I appreciate your call God bless you you might print off you can
[2:11:16.500 --> 2:11:20.220]  just Google the Stockholm syndrome got a major psychological indexes there's a
[2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:23.780]  lot of psychological isms they've developed the last decade or so that
[2:11:23.780 --> 2:11:26.940]  are ridiculous but there's a lot of them that are real this is one that's been
[2:11:26.940 --> 2:11:32.380]  around for 30 plus almost 40 years and it had been called other things
[2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:37.060]  previously but why do people love their captors why do people get into being
[2:11:37.060 --> 2:11:43.780]  slaves why do pimps I talk about the pimp game the pimp game there's a book
[2:11:43.780 --> 2:11:50.380]  coming out called that the pimp game is the Stockholm syndrome I mean they get
[2:11:50.380 --> 2:11:53.780]  these young girls go to Hollywood or New York to be models or movie stars
[2:11:53.780 --> 2:11:59.700]  they're 1718 a guy comes he's nice he gets her on drugs gets her under his
[2:11:59.700 --> 2:12:06.180]  control then he slowly starts beating her up controlling her and breaking her
[2:12:06.180 --> 2:12:10.980]  down but most women if it's done from a father figure especially if they didn't
[2:12:10.980 --> 2:12:14.020]  have a strong father or father who abused them that's who these guys look
[2:12:14.020 --> 2:12:18.380]  for they break instantly and they want to be abused they want to be dominated
[2:12:18.380 --> 2:12:25.140]  they think that strength and it's just sick to see what we've turned our women
[2:12:25.140 --> 2:12:32.860]  into and our men are even worse you know the strongest women are defending the
[2:12:32.860 --> 2:12:36.420]  family and are strong in the center of the family that's real feminism not
[2:12:36.420 --> 2:12:40.660]  this fake feminism of being whores and being used and they're just toys of
[2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:46.420]  powerful men it's a savage trick very sophisticated and it goes off in a
[2:12:46.420 --> 2:12:57.020]  hundred different directions the point is that it I got lost in the train of
[2:12:57.020 --> 2:13:04.260]  thought from my original thought oh the pimp game that's the Stockholm syndrome
[2:13:04.260 --> 2:13:08.300]  he's burning you with cigarettes he's beating you with a coat hanger he's you
[2:13:08.300 --> 2:13:15.100]  know bitch slapping you all of that they like it folks and the American people
[2:13:15.100 --> 2:13:18.340]  American men I mean I see these guys walking out of Mexican food restaurants
[2:13:18.340 --> 2:13:22.060]  or out of steak houses and they're all acting tough and they're looking at you
[2:13:22.060 --> 2:13:25.500]  making sure you're not looking at them or making sure you know you'll be
[2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:28.780]  walking down a path and guys that are bigger they'll kind of kind of walk in
[2:13:28.780 --> 2:13:32.100]  your way and if you're polite and gentlemanly and try to get out of their
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:35.940]  way they kind of who I was just powerful just then but they let the
[2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:39.060]  government shoot their kids up with poison they let the government put poison
[2:13:39.060 --> 2:13:42.060]  in their water they let the government spray him with chemicals they let the
[2:13:42.060 --> 2:13:45.740]  government have unconstitutional taxes a cop pulls them over you see these big
[2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:51.460]  men just shaken and scared they are fact similes of warriors they are fact
[2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:57.540]  similes of men a real man a real warrior is is understanding and calculating and
[2:13:57.540 --> 2:14:04.180]  realizing how society works and has discernment and is gentlemanly and
[2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:09.780]  kind and loving but at the same time can just unleash absolute savage attacks on
[2:14:09.780 --> 2:14:15.980]  people at a moment's notice if they have to not strutting around you know tough
[2:14:15.980 --> 2:14:22.100]  all day that isn't what a warrior is and and women it's not beautiful how they're
[2:14:22.100 --> 2:14:28.780]  all trolloped up like insecure whores you know that's your modern feminism you
[2:14:28.780 --> 2:14:33.780]  know instead of their powerful spiritual strength flowing out energizing and
[2:14:33.780 --> 2:14:38.700]  giving life to the family in the society it's just the enemy knows all of this
[2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:42.260]  and they're scared of your power and they try to neutralize you and make you
[2:14:42.260 --> 2:14:46.460]  feel weak and insecure you have the energy of the universe in you you are
[2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:49.820]  made in the image of the creator of the universe and even if you don't believe in
[2:14:49.820 --> 2:14:53.340]  God and all of that look what humans can do we're flying around in airplanes
[2:14:53.340 --> 2:14:59.020]  computers technology science you know there are mathematicians that can
[2:14:59.020 --> 2:15:04.900]  calculate you know billions of numbers idiot savants you know just incredible
[2:15:04.900 --> 2:15:09.620]  visions of mathematics and understanding and literature and art and poetry and
[2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:14.380]  all of it I mean I am nothing special in my mind burns with discernment and
[2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:20.020]  understanding and systems and it's indescribable that is your destiny
[2:15:20.020 --> 2:15:24.580]  ladies and gentlemen not to be some insecure part yuppie out washing their
[2:15:24.580 --> 2:15:28.340]  car I'm not saying washing your cars bad you know if that's your God if that's
[2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:32.740]  all that matters if it's lower down your hierarchy and needs that's fine I'm
[2:15:32.740 --> 2:15:38.140]  saying if your identity is you know what I'm talking about folks it's just get
[2:15:38.140 --> 2:15:43.940]  your humanity back stop caring what people think stop buying into the evil
[2:15:43.940 --> 2:15:50.820]  and get real David in North Carolina you're on the air hey Alex how are you
[2:15:50.820 --> 2:15:57.020]  good I've been this is a I'm a first-time caller I've been listening to you
[2:15:57.020 --> 2:16:02.660]  religiously for about a year listen to all your podcasts mailing because I'm
[2:16:02.660 --> 2:16:07.060]  afraid I'm gonna miss something important I'd like to talk a little bit
[2:16:07.060 --> 2:16:12.580]  about this H1N1 virus I heard you talking about in Sunday's podcast may
[2:16:12.580 --> 2:16:18.620]  have a little bit of info I go to a lot of websites and a lot of different news
[2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:23.100]  outlets and I'm not sure if you heard of a website called project Camelot dot
[2:16:23.100 --> 2:16:31.340]  ORG I have seen a little bit of videos and things yeah it's almost like a
[2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:34.780]  coast to coast to talk about a lot of different things but I mainly go there
[2:16:34.780 --> 2:16:42.060]  to see what's new about the New World Order related info and they had a guest
[2:16:42.060 --> 2:16:48.180]  speaker on his name is a Burke Elder Hale and I guess he knows and talks to a
[2:16:48.180 --> 2:16:53.660]  senior biochemist from a major pharmaceutical organization they won't
[2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:57.900]  say who it is but because it's pertaining to vaccines in H1N1
[2:16:57.900 --> 2:17:01.660]  virus I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out who they're
[2:17:01.660 --> 2:17:08.260]  talking about but basically Hale's saying that this senior biochemist was
[2:17:08.260 --> 2:17:14.140]  telling him that these chemtrails which have been out for many many years that
[2:17:14.140 --> 2:17:20.820]  people been inhaling are what's considered an aerosol per cursor and it's
[2:17:20.820 --> 2:17:28.060]  a binary weapon correct and I don't need to have some unconfirmed source to do
[2:17:28.060 --> 2:17:32.620]  that we have the research the evidence I had a team for a week in California with
[2:17:32.620 --> 2:17:38.180]  the scientist with the medical reports with state reports we've got just reams
[2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:43.300]  of it in 65 hours of footage at 64 hours of footage out there and let me
[2:17:43.300 --> 2:17:51.140]  comment on that since you bring it up I appreciate your call number one when
[2:17:51.140 --> 2:17:55.380]  you mentioned that particular source I've seen some interesting things I've
[2:17:55.380 --> 2:17:58.740]  also seen some pretty far out stuff so I'll just say that I don't really use
[2:17:58.740 --> 2:18:03.060]  that as a source and you know nothing mean to deal with that it's just that I
[2:18:03.060 --> 2:18:06.940]  don't I think it's important to have some sources that get into anything and
[2:18:06.940 --> 2:18:10.700]  everything but when I just see a continual pattern of never confirm never
[2:18:10.700 --> 2:18:16.020]  whatever and it seems people always latch on to what's not confirmed instead
[2:18:16.020 --> 2:18:19.020]  of oh here's the documents for the clergy response teams are here's this
[2:18:19.020 --> 2:18:21.980]  all that's fake or oh we're really a level six and two months later it's
[2:18:21.980 --> 2:18:27.820]  confirmed you know I have the document I gave you the document yes binary weapon
[2:18:27.820 --> 2:18:34.820]  system that's certainly part of it but there's multiple programs with the
[2:18:34.820 --> 2:18:38.620]  aerosol programs that are going on there's a whole bunch of different
[2:18:38.620 --> 2:18:43.420]  programs and hundreds and hundreds of them are public I mean just search
[2:18:43.420 --> 2:18:52.540]  engine a term like biological test over Oklahoma bacteria sprayed or biological
[2:18:52.540 --> 2:18:58.180]  test over Texas bacteria sprayed or biological test bacteria sprayed New
[2:18:58.180 --> 2:19:05.380]  York doesn't matter what state you're in you're gonna find an article and then
[2:19:05.380 --> 2:19:08.980]  you read the name of the bacteria and you do a search on it and it's one that
[2:19:08.980 --> 2:19:14.660]  causes sterilization in all mammal species it's one that causes spontaneous
[2:19:14.660 --> 2:19:19.420]  abortion in all mammal species and then there they are in the paper saying oh
[2:19:19.420 --> 2:19:23.100]  we're spraying Oklahoma City and all surrounding you know towns the neck this
[2:19:23.100 --> 2:19:28.300]  summer with this spray and it's subtelus globigy and you go lookups in
[2:19:28.300 --> 2:19:33.340]  septelus and trellis I forget the other name of the bacteria but but see that no
[2:19:33.340 --> 2:19:37.420]  one will talk about hundreds of mainstream articles spraying us it's
[2:19:37.420 --> 2:19:41.020]  all I heard a doctor who knows the scientists who talked to somebody who
[2:19:41.020 --> 2:19:48.860]  said a reptoid did it and you know my whole issue is I'm covering what I can
[2:19:48.860 --> 2:19:52.860]  prove yeah I mean we got the White House science chief saying they're putting
[2:19:52.860 --> 2:19:56.620]  binary systems in your water to sterilize you and nobody wants to talk
[2:19:56.620 --> 2:20:02.580]  about that because it's official it's official this is Alex Jones and I want

[2:24:21.260 --> 2:24:26.860]  in a moment but Paul Hartman I don't watch a lot of TV but I did years ago
[2:24:26.860 --> 2:24:32.700]  catch a little bit of a show about the pimp game and when I saw it and then I
[2:24:32.700 --> 2:24:38.020]  researched it more that's how the elite treat the general public and it is the
[2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:43.260]  Stockholm syndrome or similar to it where they love their abusers they give
[2:24:43.260 --> 2:24:47.620]  up think they're powerless and are then like children or like a dog you beat it
[2:24:47.620 --> 2:24:52.620]  just loves you more it just grovels more and they've taken our fighting spirit
[2:24:52.620 --> 2:24:57.340]  as Americans and broke our back and made us capitulate like a whore and you
[2:24:57.340 --> 2:25:00.220]  were in there saying you're trying to find the clip online as we want to play
[2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:04.180]  it of what pimps up hose down was named the show on HBO but but you were telling
[2:25:04.180 --> 2:25:09.180]  the story Paul Hartman out during the break with great precision repeat that
[2:25:09.180 --> 2:25:15.020]  story well it's just a part and I don't know if it's the documentary pimps up
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:19.580]  hose down they kind of showcase all these famous pimps and throughout the
[2:25:19.580 --> 2:25:24.220]  U.S. and I don't know if it's pimping Ken or Don Magic one they're kind of big
[2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:29.220]  pimps in the whole hip-hop world and one of them is that they're in the corner
[2:25:29.220 --> 2:25:37.540]  telling a story about how one of his workers one of his hose has was had
[2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:42.380]  gotten beat up shot stabbed the whole nine and he goes to the hospital and
[2:25:42.380 --> 2:25:49.420]  she's in the recovery room and whatnot and the the worker I hate to say the word
[2:25:49.420 --> 2:25:55.540]  hoe but the whore lady was saying oh baby I'm gonna get better I'm gonna get up
[2:25:55.540 --> 2:25:59.140]  on the streets I'm gonna make that money for y'all be better don't worry about it
[2:25:59.140 --> 2:26:03.660]  I'm gonna I'll be out there I got you I love you baby I'm gonna make this money
[2:26:03.660 --> 2:26:10.380]  for you and if any the the pimp says that he looks at the females mother and
[2:26:10.380 --> 2:26:14.140]  she just starts tearing up and she's saying what did you do to my baby what
[2:26:14.140 --> 2:26:19.580]  have you done and it's kind of I don't really know what happens after that but
[2:26:19.580 --> 2:26:24.940]  it was just crazy to see how this woman just obviously was brainwashed under
[2:26:24.940 --> 2:26:28.420]  mind control but but see it's double think or what they call crime stop in
[2:26:28.420 --> 2:26:31.900]  Orwell because Orwell had worked with the Soviets then with British
[2:26:31.900 --> 2:26:35.060]  intelligence for British intelligence then the Soviets then found out it was
[2:26:35.060 --> 2:26:40.100]  all run from the top by British Intel and that's what 1984 is about fake wars
[2:26:40.100 --> 2:26:45.460]  with East Asia with Russia with airstrip one in the US really is a war
[2:26:45.460 --> 2:26:48.660]  against the people he figures out the government stage in the terror attacks
[2:26:48.660 --> 2:26:54.380]  all of it he worked with OSS in the highest levels of propaganda and then
[2:26:54.380 --> 2:26:56.860]  it's clear they killed him one year after that book came out he died
[2:26:56.860 --> 2:27:00.380]  mysteriously he even went and hid out on island in Scotland when he was writing
[2:27:00.380 --> 2:27:04.820]  it he ran away from him Eric Blair was his real name but but he talks about
[2:27:04.820 --> 2:27:09.820]  pimping the hose basically the breaking of the spirit and you know the pimps will
[2:27:09.820 --> 2:27:13.860]  take 99% of the money these women will be have nothing and the worst they treat
[2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:19.300]  them the more they love it and it's the Stockholm syndrome and and Barack Obama
[2:27:19.300 --> 2:27:24.620]  is our American Pimp he is literally pimping us lying just like Bush but
[2:27:24.620 --> 2:27:31.220]  even worse I mean it's sick man there's there's also a portion of this
[2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:34.740]  particular documentary I'm talking about where they're talking to the pimps and
[2:27:34.740 --> 2:27:38.540]  they're like well how much do you break off to your hose and this and that and
[2:27:38.540 --> 2:27:43.500]  the the person asking the questions like you give them 5% 10% and all of them
[2:27:43.500 --> 2:27:48.020]  are like I give nothing they don't want nothing I'll give them some chicken
[2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:51.260]  they'll be happy they get them some chicken I'll give them something to eat
[2:27:51.260 --> 2:27:55.580]  nothing a place to stay but no I take everything I want everything they don't
[2:27:55.580 --> 2:28:02.380]  get no 10% that's my money well you know growing up in high school I wasn't in
[2:28:02.380 --> 2:28:07.140]  the whole cool guy not cool guy thing I was kind of on my own way and it didn't
[2:28:07.140 --> 2:28:10.860]  understand everything work but I was popular because I didn't care about
[2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:15.020]  being popular and then later as I grew up and realized how psychology worked
[2:28:15.020 --> 2:28:19.020]  it's like the bad guy who drives the fast car and wears the leather jacket and
[2:28:19.020 --> 2:28:22.340]  is mean to his girlfriend is the guy that just has women just falling down
[2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:26.060]  over themselves and I wasn't mean to my girlfriends but but I was very popular
[2:28:26.060 --> 2:28:30.100]  because I just wouldn't put up any crap well it's even worse if you treat them
[2:28:30.100 --> 2:28:35.020]  even worse they love it they love it that public loves giving their kids cancer
[2:28:35.020 --> 2:28:39.260]  viruses they love drinking sodium fluoride they love having everything they
[2:28:39.260 --> 2:28:42.660]  love cops now have you heard in Chicago they're just gonna shoot people at

[2:34:30.020 --> 2:34:34.940]  college and become slaves because mommy and daddy were so nice or things were so
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:40.060]  cushioned and they just didn't know how to stand up to something like that or
[2:34:40.060 --> 2:34:44.860]  they came from such poor families it's the same and the adults give their

[2:35:07.860 --> 2:35:13.660]  bondage folks it's a spirit it's an idea it's a system it's an attitude and I'm
[2:35:13.660 --> 2:35:25.460]  saying no I am not your slave so it's that simple and we have to get aggressive
[2:35:25.460 --> 2:35:32.020]  we have to get strong we have to get focused and we have to say no just because
[2:35:32.020 --> 2:35:35.660]  they they train us how to push us around and then now they're going yeah

[2:37:42.260 --> 2:37:47.980]  effort to create message discipline among the pro-Obama organization so that
[2:37:47.980 --> 2:37:52.100]  means a master repeater they put out up here at the top of the pyramid the
[2:37:52.100 --> 2:37:56.620]  orders the nomenclature you know that war is loving and liberal and hiring
[2:37:56.620 --> 2:38:00.020]  nothing but lobbyist is not hiring lobbyist and letting the banks have
[2:38:00.020 --> 2:38:05.420]  23.7 trillion is good and Obama writing loopholes for all of them is stopping
[2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:10.020]  loopholes and they throttle and attack any little left-wing site that doesn't
[2:38:10.020 --> 2:38:18.180]  stay in line this is a master pimp this guy is keeping all a massive string of
[2:38:18.180 --> 2:38:22.940]  left-wing political prostitutes paid meager amounts from the White House
[2:38:22.940 --> 2:38:28.580]  Fund to attack anybody that didn't for the world government takeover I mean
[2:38:28.580 --> 2:38:39.420]  look at him he's a pimp game that's all this is so he's a master commissar and I
[2:38:39.420 --> 2:38:44.380]  take it as a great badge of courage and honor that weekly now I have national
[2:38:44.380 --> 2:38:49.940]  publications and the allied propaganda arms of the White House attacking me
[2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:55.420]  that means I'm doing a good job thank you God for giving me the lead the guidance
[2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:59.340]  and directing me to I know I haven't lived up to the full potential but thank
[2:38:59.340 --> 2:39:03.740]  you and thank you please continue to lead me against the enemy and help me
[2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:08.140]  lead others against the enemy and these people are the enemy I mean these are
[2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:13.420]  social engineers official textbook with the head of the White House science
[2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:18.180]  running it to sterilize take all children forcibly sterilize you world
[2:39:18.180 --> 2:39:22.980]  government open I mean open public mainstream associated press with with
[2:39:22.980 --> 2:39:27.940]  mainstream news going what's wrong with sterilizing everybody you know I mean
[2:39:27.940 --> 2:39:34.100]  these people are hardcore savage off the hook I mean they are wild man I mean
[2:39:34.100 --> 2:39:38.580]  that is bold you got to hand it to them I mean they they're running the show and
[2:39:38.580 --> 2:39:44.260]  they're they're spiking your water and it's funny so
[2:39:46.500 --> 2:39:51.500]  direct ties to the White House think progress was vehemently anti-war during
[2:39:51.500 --> 2:39:55.420]  the Bush administration but since Obama took power bombing brown people in
[2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:58.900]  broken back third world countries has apparently become a progressive and
[2:39:58.900 --> 2:40:03.140]  liberal virtue and if you're against it you're a racist oh you don't want to take
[2:40:03.140 --> 2:40:08.220]  black foster kids and test pesticide until they die yeah I've been attacked
[2:40:08.220 --> 2:40:12.540]  for talk of Jones crazily says there's eugenics and a plan to hell I'm sourcing
[2:40:12.540 --> 2:40:15.900]  New York Daily News with them killing the black kids what I don't I don't want to
[2:40:15.900 --> 2:40:19.780]  kill a black baby so I'm a racist I mean you people make me sick I don't I don't
[2:40:19.780 --> 2:40:24.020]  have a Margaret Sanger statue in my backyard like some of you guys do who
[2:40:24.020 --> 2:40:30.660]  call black subhuman you mean I'm a racist so you got your little front man out
[2:40:30.660 --> 2:40:40.300]  there seeing you got all these people not just people that are being pimped by
[2:40:40.300 --> 2:40:43.540]  the system you've got the house slaves the people that think they're part of
[2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:47.980]  the system and then you got the general public that are out the barn and that's
[2:40:47.980 --> 2:40:51.460]  what this society's turned into we're all slaves and they want us fighting with
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:55.740]  each other that's what they love saying we have more of a debate about race to
[2:40:55.740 --> 2:40:58.980]  always keep it in the front burner in fighting with each other instead of
[2:40:58.980 --> 2:41:03.260]  fighting with the bankers and their little pimps that carry out their
[2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:11.620]  operations think progress was family anti-war during the Bush administration
[2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:14.780]  but since Obama took power bombing brown people and broke back third world
[2:41:14.780 --> 2:41:18.140]  countries has apparently become a progressive and liberal virtue according
[2:41:18.140 --> 2:41:21.620]  to the Center for American Progress Director Jennifer Palmari the
[2:41:21.620 --> 2:41:27.260]  organization is focused around driving the White House's message and agenda and
[2:41:27.260 --> 2:41:37.940]  what is that every week front story me I'm evil I'm bad I'm a terrorist how on
[2:41:37.940 --> 2:41:41.700]  earth can driving the White House's message and agenda be deemed nonpartisan
[2:41:41.700 --> 2:41:46.460]  make progress is nothing more than a echo chamber for Obama administration
[2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:50.940]  propaganda it's the Free Republic of the left wing it's about as nonpartisan as
[2:41:50.940 --> 2:41:55.100]  the Communist Party propaganda organ Prova was during the Cold War through
[2:41:55.100 --> 2:41:58.940]  the Center for American Progress is shy about revealing its funders according to
[2:41:58.940 --> 2:42:03.940]  Source Watch no less than 58 foundations have donated $15 million since 2003 as
[2:42:03.940 --> 2:42:07.980]  well as corporations and elitist philanthropy such as George Soros and I
[2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:14.140]  would add David Rockefeller who donated $3 million for general support in 2006 in
[2:42:14.140 --> 2:42:18.060]  an article of our representative Louie Gomez appearance on the Alex Jones show
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:22.740]  last week they warned about the health care bill think progress attempts to
[2:42:22.740 --> 2:42:27.300]  discredit the subject of referring to the host Jones as radical conspiracy
[2:42:27.300 --> 2:42:31.580]  theorist because of his views on the Oklahoma City bombing and 9-11 the
[2:42:31.580 --> 2:42:34.980]  editors of think progress are apparently lagging far behind the
[2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:38.620]  understanding of public opinion seemingly unaware of the fact that polls
[2:42:38.620 --> 2:42:43.420]  taken three years ago by New York Times show that an overwhelming majority 84
[2:42:43.420 --> 2:42:48.100]  percent of Americans have doubts about the official 9-11 story the article
[2:42:48.100 --> 2:42:51.940]  also calls Jones claimed that White House science czar John P. Holdren's
[2:42:51.940 --> 2:42:55.820]  advocated putting sterilants in the water supply conspiracy theory despite the
[2:42:55.820 --> 2:43:00.140]  fact that it's clearly documented in his own book excerpts of which have been
[2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:04.300]  posted on the internet however think progress must egregious smear attempts
[2:43:04.300 --> 2:43:07.820]  in the last paragraph of the article
[2:43:09.420 --> 2:43:15.860]  and it goes on from there to basically say I'm a cop killer now that I'm you
[2:43:15.860 --> 2:43:19.900]  know leading cop killers and that's because they want to sick the police on
[2:43:19.900 --> 2:43:24.180]  the public and that's their hate crime they can't win they're losing they
[2:43:24.180 --> 2:43:27.740]  can't intimidate any people as commas ours we're not the poor Russians with a
[2:43:27.740 --> 2:43:31.500]  history of being slaves to the czar's we're Americans I'm not bashing the
[2:43:31.500 --> 2:43:34.660]  Russians just our history is different you may have drugged us with food and
[2:43:34.660 --> 2:43:40.380]  entertainment and all the crap but people are waking up the Giants rubbing the
[2:43:40.380 --> 2:43:44.580]  sleep from his eyes and going who and the establishment's going get those
[2:43:44.580 --> 2:43:48.660]  patriots giant they're the bad one get those let us have all the banker money
[2:43:48.660 --> 2:43:53.660]  let us here drink some more fluoride giant the Giants going you bad you
[2:43:53.660 --> 2:44:02.540]  banker here and you know they don't like it ladies and gentlemen despite his
[2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:06.540]  outlandish views George Soros writes David Rockefeller writes that's who's
[2:44:06.540 --> 2:44:10.340]  writing this his publication despite his outlandish views Jones influence cannot
[2:44:10.340 --> 2:44:17.300]  be underestimated people are listening to the millions every week despite his
[2:44:17.300 --> 2:44:21.180]  outlandish views Jones influence cannot be underestimated Richard Poplowski the
[2:44:21.180 --> 2:44:24.020]  young man who gunned down three Pittsburgh police officers earlier this
[2:44:24.020 --> 2:44:28.420]  year after posting a fear that government would confiscate his guns was a die
[2:44:28.420 --> 2:44:32.420]  hard Jones fan Jones who ranched daily about Obama's intentions to revoke the
[2:44:32.420 --> 2:44:37.180]  Second Amendment is also one of the loudest voices of the birther movement
[2:44:37.180 --> 2:44:42.580]  now that is not true I am not one of the biggest met voices in the birth or
[2:44:42.580 --> 2:44:46.380]  movement I did not even cover it in the Obama deception because I can prove
[2:44:46.380 --> 2:44:50.060]  everything in the Obama deception I can't prove the birther thing we've
[2:44:50.060 --> 2:44:54.260]  probably done 10 shows on it out of 500 you know I've been doing this for a year
[2:44:54.260 --> 2:45:00.620]  and a half probably 400 500 shows but the way they're acting suspicious about it
[2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:06.380]  not releasing the original but a receipt is getting suspicious but see that's
[2:45:06.380 --> 2:45:12.100]  pointless the issue here is Richard Poplowski posted on hundreds of sites
[2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:17.340]  and attacked me on scores of sites and attacked me on my own website but here's
[2:45:17.340 --> 2:45:22.140]  the big issue that everybody needs to have sink in within two hours of him
[2:45:22.140 --> 2:45:27.060]  killing three cops at his house because his mother was kicking him out because
[2:45:27.060 --> 2:45:30.300]  his dogs were peeing on the floor spoiled brat with a bunch of pit bulls he
[2:45:30.300 --> 2:45:34.820]  couldn't take care of kicked out of the Marines he was drunk got home at 2 3 in
[2:45:34.820 --> 2:45:38.420]  the morning she wakes him up at 637 screaming at him he throws a fit the
[2:45:38.420 --> 2:45:42.780]  cops get there he shoots him horrible person reportedly came out on the
[2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:46.820]  street and shot him of course it's bad to the Chicago cops are going to shoot
[2:45:46.820 --> 2:45:50.500]  people that quote run away or don't stop fast enough so you know we're humans
[2:45:50.500 --> 2:45:55.860]  too pal but it'll be good when they kill us in cold blood you know but but but
[2:45:55.860 --> 2:46:01.980]  the issue is that Poplowski does this and within two hours of them having his
[2:46:01.980 --> 2:46:08.140]  computer they go to the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center handler the handler
[2:46:08.140 --> 2:46:13.540]  they're in the town the local guy that writes articles about this keep
[2:46:13.540 --> 2:46:17.220]  everybody stirred up at the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and they say he's a huge
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:21.140]  fan according to the Southern Poverty Law Center who's seen the computer
[2:46:21.140 --> 2:46:26.700]  within two hours within two hours it Alex Jones is the number one target and
[2:46:26.700 --> 2:46:29.700]  it turned out it's now coming out in court hundreds of sites and we can
[2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:38.220]  search his handle he was all over the web attacking me and they knew that so
[2:46:38.220 --> 2:46:45.060]  what does that tell you out there the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL in
[2:46:45.060 --> 2:46:48.740]  private intelligence arms of the National Security Council of the White
[2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:54.100]  House both parties are after me folks and here is the George Soros David
[2:46:54.100 --> 2:46:57.780]  Rockefeller funded they always mentioned Soros of the Rockefeller's fund more
[2:46:57.780 --> 2:47:03.540]  when you go look at this group and all these others they are out to get me
[2:47:03.540 --> 2:47:14.580]  now daily costs raw story and a bunch of others that have some foundation money
[2:47:14.580 --> 2:47:18.660]  going to them they apologize when the quotes came out that the ploskey was
[2:47:18.660 --> 2:47:22.580]  attacking me because I wasn't for violence and because I don't make it all
[2:47:22.580 --> 2:47:32.380]  about Jews they retracted but not the New York Times they went after me with it
[2:47:32.380 --> 2:47:39.020]  so the White House is putting out this same thing and it's not gonna help you
[2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:44.020]  and if you kill me everybody's gonna know what's going on and I know you
[2:47:44.020 --> 2:47:48.140]  killed a lot of people your handlers have and if you've set me up I'm as pure
[2:47:48.140 --> 2:47:51.700]  as a driven snow except for speeding occasionally and I'm trying to control
[2:47:51.700 --> 2:48:02.140]  myself but I just enjoy it but look you can't win and so that's the bottom
[2:48:02.140 --> 2:48:06.700]  line and we don't want to escalate this into a violent situation you want to
[2:48:06.700 --> 2:48:09.780]  make it violent you want to start arresting people you want to start
[2:48:09.780 --> 2:48:13.140]  banning free speech you want to claim we're all terrorists and put us in a
[2:48:13.140 --> 2:48:19.060]  corner there's smarter elites that know that this isn't gonna go well for you so
[2:48:19.060 --> 2:48:27.700]  I you know to the White House and to all of you your criminals you're doing bad
[2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:32.100]  things I don't know how you rationalize what you do but say la vie the truth is
[2:48:32.100 --> 2:48:37.420]  the truth and let's start playing this Chris Matthews now this is part of the
[2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:45.580]  clip the whole clips up on info wars calm we need to queue it up I think it's
[2:48:45.580 --> 2:48:49.700]  four four minutes in guys four minutes 20 seconds and I gave you the timecode
[2:48:49.700 --> 2:48:56.900]  this morning in this clip they say that you're a crazy conspiracy theorist if
[2:48:56.900 --> 2:48:59.820]  you believe the bilgerberg group wants a world government I remember five years
[2:48:59.820 --> 2:49:03.780]  ago the media said bilgerberg didn't exist you were crazy if it existed now
[2:49:03.780 --> 2:49:07.140]  they say okay if you believe they're setting up a world government
[2:49:07.140 --> 2:49:11.460]  bilgerberg group members write op-ed pieces like Henry Kissinger in the New
[2:49:11.460 --> 2:49:16.100]  York Times and they write articles in the Times of London Financial Times Time
[2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:23.700]  magazine called New World Order Newsweek calling for world government and they
[2:49:23.700 --> 2:49:29.060]  say that we're mentally ill and he lists some psychological test that we're
[2:49:29.060 --> 2:49:35.860]  howling at the moon that we're insane that we're crazy that we're scum that
[2:49:35.860 --> 2:49:41.060]  we're filth that we're trash that we're dangerous they mixed the birther thing
[2:49:41.060 --> 2:49:47.180]  with 9-11 truth one guy goes off the talking point of attacking Ron Paul but
[2:49:47.180 --> 2:49:52.500]  you notice Matthews is actual CIA actual government op so he corrects the
[2:49:52.500 --> 2:49:56.260]  propaganda so he goes wait wait that's an old piece of info we failed there
[2:49:56.260 --> 2:50:02.020]  don't don't bring Paul in see they tried to demonize him they try but it didn't
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:07.700]  work so now they're trying to embrace him and co-op not working so see you
[2:50:07.700 --> 2:50:10.980]  learn so much watching this one video because they're talking about how
[2:50:10.980 --> 2:50:14.620]  desperate they are and how much power we've got and we're taking over but oh
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:18.140]  we sure hope the Republicans embrace this this will destroy them that's like
[2:50:18.140 --> 2:50:21.220]  please don't throw me in the briar patch this will actually empower the
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:25.140]  Republicans if they wanted to become populace in anti-New World Order every
[2:50:25.140 --> 2:50:31.660]  poll's got 70 80 90% depending on the issue against the New World Order the
[2:50:31.660 --> 2:50:34.220]  reason both parties are falling apart is because everybody knows they're the same
[2:50:34.220 --> 2:50:38.900]  so this is a desperate desperate video piece we're gonna play and break down on
[2:50:38.900 --> 2:50:41.380]  the other side of the break and we'll take some more of your calls for folks

[2:57:06.140 --> 2:57:09.540]  desperate and we'll go into the next segment with us listen how desperate
[2:57:09.540 --> 2:57:18.380]  Chris Matthews is here listen to this to be able to lay the groundwork for some
[2:57:18.380 --> 2:57:23.740]  sort of Manchurian candidate presidency well well Chris this isn't a full
[2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:28.740]  Mooner theory by the way anybody thinks like that this isn't really about facts
[2:57:28.740 --> 2:57:33.420]  it's about emotion and I can tell you from having for example covered one of
[2:57:33.420 --> 2:57:37.540]  the the Tea Party events down in Kentucky where I began as a reporter back
[2:57:37.540 --> 2:57:41.700]  in April those same people that I saw there some of them had paused that
[2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:47.460]  people were worried see I could spend an hour just on a three-minute clip the
[2:57:47.460 --> 2:57:53.220]  whole clips 10 minutes but I got three minutes marked out back that up you
[2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:56.900]  notice he's addressing the audience he says there are people that think he's
[2:57:56.900 --> 2:58:01.500]  some kind of Manchurian candidate no there's people saying he may have been
[2:58:01.500 --> 2:58:05.820]  born in a foreign country and not be legitimate but he takes that into he's
[2:58:05.820 --> 2:58:14.180]  mind-controlled trained in Western China so that he mislabeled it as something
[2:58:14.180 --> 2:58:21.300]  kooky then he says by the way if you believe that you're a kook you're a
[2:58:21.300 --> 2:58:25.260]  full Mooner so a lot of people hearing that go yeah well I think there's
[2:58:25.260 --> 2:58:29.060]  something going on with where he was born he goes well you're a cook so he
[2:58:29.060 --> 2:58:33.900]  tells you how to think first he misrepresents what we're saying then he
[2:58:33.900 --> 2:58:38.740]  says and if you think that you're a kook everything is psi off train I mean
[2:58:38.740 --> 2:58:51.460]  this guy CIA thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN Live.com today this is

[2:58:59.140 --> 2:59:03.420]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:59:03.420 --> 2:59:07.660]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government

[2:59:11.620 --> 2:59:15.540]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:15.540 --> 2:59:19.140]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[2:59:19.140 --> 2:59:22.500]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[2:59:22.500 --> 2:59:26.700]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power

[3:00:00.900 --> 3:00:20.900]  Think about Chris Matthews. I mean they admit Anderson Cooper is CIA, CIA trained.
[3:00:20.900 --> 3:00:26.500]  Most of these Georgetown guys are. This guy's got intelligence connections.
[3:00:26.500 --> 3:00:30.300]  Clinton and Hillary are admittedly a fake CIA couple. We even know the name of
[3:00:30.300 --> 3:00:36.820]  their CIA handler. That's mainstream history and everything's divide the
[3:00:36.820 --> 3:00:44.580]  people, inject race but they always say it's for bringing everybody together he's
[3:00:44.580 --> 3:00:47.340]  a limousine liberal I don't know what's worse these fake right-wingers or these
[3:00:47.340 --> 3:00:53.940]  fake leftists they're all disgusting but here he is let's let's go ahead and
[3:00:53.940 --> 3:00:59.140]  play Chris Matthews and see well well Chris this isn't really a full moon or
[3:00:59.140 --> 3:01:04.060]  theory by the way anybody thinks like that this isn't really about facts it's
[3:01:04.060 --> 3:01:08.420]  about emotion and I can tell you from having for example covered one of the
[3:01:08.420 --> 3:01:13.940]  every time they deliver every time these guys deliver their 10 or 15 different
[3:01:13.940 --> 3:01:17.980]  talking points in different permutations they always do little satisfied
[3:01:17.980 --> 3:01:22.020]  ticks like hmm I'm really slick I just said your old kooks if you think that and
[3:01:22.020 --> 3:01:27.100]  all the weak-minded followers will now buy into that I I'm doing a great job
[3:01:27.100 --> 3:01:31.660]  but then this guy gets off the script and attacks Ron Paul and Matthews no no
[3:01:31.660 --> 3:01:37.460]  we failed in attacking him that backfire don't don't don't don't know because see
[3:01:37.460 --> 3:01:42.140]  they wanted to tie Ron Paul to me on Fox and CNN and MSNBC and they did and it
[3:01:42.140 --> 3:01:46.900]  only made him bigger and so then they try to attack us and say we're weak and
[3:01:46.900 --> 3:01:50.860]  we're kooks and this information's got a backfire on us but then they also talk
[3:01:50.860 --> 3:01:55.580]  about how scary it is I mean listen no one listens to you no one believes you
[3:01:55.580 --> 3:02:00.700]  anymore they may not know about what all the lies are but they know your liars so
[3:02:00.700 --> 3:02:04.380]  let's go back I mean look at this dinosaurs trying to manipulate and lie
[3:02:04.380 --> 3:02:07.980]  to the American people listen you bastard we're not telling people what to
[3:02:07.980 --> 3:02:12.500]  think we're just telling to unlock their minds and start paying attention to your
[3:02:12.500 --> 3:02:20.300]  tricks do you got me boy he's go ahead back to that little bastard it's down in
[3:02:20.300 --> 3:02:24.540]  Kentucky where I began as a reporter back in April those same people that I
[3:02:24.540 --> 3:02:28.260]  saw there some of them the people who are worrying about the government taking
[3:02:28.260 --> 3:02:32.820]  up the guns the people who deny that the federal government has a right to tax
[3:02:32.820 --> 3:02:38.380]  your income the people who are the whole country started about taxation without
[3:02:38.380 --> 3:02:43.340]  representation there's scores of little cell phone taxes and water taxes and
[3:02:43.340 --> 3:02:50.340]  federal and state fees they just add on without even legislatures passing bills
[3:02:50.340 --> 3:02:55.660]  they've got more than 15 bills now they're reduced to ban all guns if the
[3:02:55.660 --> 3:02:59.180]  attorney general wants to ban anybody he wants from owning a gun without even
[3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:04.380]  being convicted or arrested you know bills to shut down ammo bills to register
[3:03:04.380 --> 3:03:09.540]  and they just get up and say there's no bills there's no bills I mean that's why
[3:03:09.540 --> 3:03:15.180]  these guys have no credibility and they keep lying and lying and lying and it
[3:03:15.180 --> 3:03:19.180]  it just gets worse from here so there you go the feds contacts whatever they
[3:03:19.180 --> 3:03:25.580]  want it's anti-american to ever question it it just just continue worried
[3:03:25.580 --> 3:03:30.140]  about being overrun that the borders worried about the oh yeah we're not
[3:03:30.140 --> 3:03:34.580]  being overrun there's just 30 million illegals all the western states are on
[3:03:34.580 --> 3:03:38.380]  the edge or I've already gone bankrupt because the illegal aliens aren't they
[3:03:38.380 --> 3:03:41.260]  even bad people but they come here and get on welfare and they get free
[3:03:41.260 --> 3:03:45.500]  health care and they live 10 to a house and so it's destroying our standard of
[3:03:45.500 --> 3:03:50.980]  living and the media always makes it well then you don't like Hispanics then
[3:03:50.980 --> 3:03:56.020]  really Gallup polls show 80 plus percent of Hispanics want the border shut down
[3:03:56.020 --> 3:04:00.300]  they know they're losing their jobs Hispanic Americans see that's another
[3:04:00.300 --> 3:04:04.340]  group think everybody who wants to control the borders is a racist how about
[3:04:04.340 --> 3:04:08.940]  we don't want 500 million Latin Americans coming up here and turning this
[3:04:08.940 --> 3:04:13.900]  into Guatemala City how about that how about we don't want to be Mexico City
[3:04:13.900 --> 3:04:18.540]  how about we want to get liberty down there but they use the US as a steam
[3:04:18.540 --> 3:04:22.900]  valve for Mexico they would have already had revolution down there so see oh
[3:04:22.900 --> 3:04:27.660]  there's these crazies who believe the borders are too open there are these
[3:04:27.660 --> 3:04:31.780]  crazies that think there's a border problem oh my these are really radical
[3:04:31.780 --> 3:04:38.020]  nuts I mean these are my god so they are tying the birther issue because that
[3:04:38.020 --> 3:04:41.740]  maybe baloney may not whatever so they can then try to discredit everything
[3:04:41.740 --> 3:04:45.140]  else like and next they come back and go there's these people that believe the
[3:04:45.140 --> 3:04:48.700]  Bilderberg group wants world government it's only in the newspaper a hundred

[3:08:27.860 --> 3:08:31.500]  done with us is gonna be Webster Carple just a moment specifically talking
[3:08:31.500 --> 3:08:35.060]  about where we've gone so far and where it's going in the future but I wanted to
[3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:39.020]  finish up with this Chris Matthews clip where they say if you think the borders
[3:08:39.020 --> 3:08:43.780]  are too open or you think that Obama wants your guns when the bills I mean
[3:08:43.780 --> 3:08:48.660]  his attorney general argued as a just department lawyer last year for complete
[3:08:48.660 --> 3:08:54.740]  gun ban in DC heller so to my or wrote a book saying there's no second amendment
[3:08:54.740 --> 3:08:57.820]  she was asked about it she said well I won't say if you have a right or not to
[3:08:57.820 --> 3:09:02.340]  even self-defense I could list all the bills we have it's in the Obama
[3:09:02.340 --> 3:09:06.980]  deception the Obama deception was was was put out a month and a half after he
[3:09:06.980 --> 3:09:11.740]  was in office and I show five different gun bills with the bill number blown up
[3:09:11.740 --> 3:09:14.980]  where the attorney general can ban all guns if he wants to just gives him that
[3:09:14.980 --> 3:09:19.940]  power ban anybody flying who owned who they want to then so you can own a gun
[3:09:19.940 --> 3:09:25.580]  all extra judicial I mean that's the thing is is that it's all happening
[3:09:25.580 --> 3:09:31.580]  right now they're trying to reauthorize the assault weapons ban which means any
[3:09:31.580 --> 3:09:36.540]  semi-automatic rifle and this guy just says you're a lunatic it doesn't
[3:09:36.540 --> 3:09:42.660]  exist this guy is a hoax it's all lies and that's why Matthew's has like a
[3:09:42.660 --> 3:09:47.900]  half million viewers or something I mean we've got more than that every 30
[3:09:47.900 --> 3:09:52.820]  minutes here on the radio their legends in their own minds they're meant to fool
[3:09:52.820 --> 3:09:56.900]  that small percentage of people that still watch TV and still believe these
[3:09:56.900 --> 3:10:01.380]  idiots I know Riley supposedly biggest thing on TV has three and a half million
[3:10:01.380 --> 3:10:05.340]  viewers top nights Beck's got three and a half million do you know what Beck has
[3:10:05.340 --> 3:10:13.420]  on the radio 12 million Limbaugh's got 22 million George Norrie has 16 million
[3:10:14.740 --> 3:10:21.460]  Google animatronics what's it called what's the Google system computer says
[3:10:21.460 --> 3:10:27.100]  I have four into unique four plus million unique visitors to info wars alone
[3:10:27.100 --> 3:10:33.220]  each month Google analytics yes there you go I was engaging in a bonnix and
[3:10:33.220 --> 3:10:39.500]  vending words the legends in their own mind legends finish up with his
[3:10:39.500 --> 3:10:43.020]  propaganda we're going to Webster Tarpley here it is the NRA the rights of
[3:10:43.020 --> 3:10:47.540]  the NRA and so forth a lot of those same rejectionist front if you will or out
[3:10:47.540 --> 3:10:53.060]  there looking for a reason to find conspiracy see he's saying conspiracy
[3:10:53.060 --> 3:10:56.420]  theory if you believe there's rights he never says second amendment it's always
[3:10:56.420 --> 3:11:00.940]  the NRA see that which is a controlled opposition group they never talk about
[3:11:00.940 --> 3:11:05.780]  your second limit it's always the NRA turning your right into some group it's
[3:11:05.780 --> 3:11:09.660]  all about miscasting mislabeling these guys are trained in this go back to it
[3:11:09.660 --> 3:11:14.860]  in the presidency of Barack Obama there are just enough annoying little
[3:11:14.860 --> 3:11:19.060]  bureaucratic details that they can seize on having to do with the original
[3:11:19.060 --> 3:11:23.260]  birth certificate etc which are all legally and factually beside the point
[3:11:23.260 --> 3:11:27.020]  but there are enough of them that allows the people on the fringes of the party
[3:11:27.020 --> 3:11:29.660]  to do what they're going to do and you know when they when the when the river
[3:11:29.660 --> 3:11:35.540]  is low the riverbed is exposed the river the river is it pause hit pause let's
[3:11:35.540 --> 3:11:42.060]  talk truth again mr. mr. deceiver when Barack Obama was elected Congress had
[3:11:42.060 --> 3:11:47.980]  an 11 percent approval rating in kind of the fake euphoria it went up to 15
[3:11:47.980 --> 3:11:52.380]  points it's back down to 11 Ross muson gallop I've got them all right here
[3:11:52.380 --> 3:11:59.940]  Gallop poll I've got another one here over 50% think it should be abolished
[3:11:59.940 --> 3:12:03.500]  that everything's their fault I mean I mean you know you guys are in trouble
[3:12:03.500 --> 3:12:11.180]  here Obama's approval rating has fallen from 84 to below 50 in Ross muson so the
[3:12:11.180 --> 3:12:16.420]  rivers low it's Obama whose rivers low and yes the Republicans are too for the
[3:12:16.420 --> 3:12:20.340]  first time we were having a real realignment Obama was some psychological
[3:12:20.340 --> 3:12:25.420]  trick they tried to fla throw in of well he's got some brown skin he's 6.5%
[3:12:25.420 --> 3:12:32.540]  African and then you know 47% Arab and 50% Anglo-Saxon they'll think he's black
[3:12:32.540 --> 3:12:37.820]  and it's all hoaxes within hoaxes so here's this guy saying the rivers low
[3:12:37.820 --> 3:12:41.660]  the Republicans are dead they're all a bunch of conspiracy theorists and the
[3:12:41.660 --> 3:12:46.380]  Republicans better run from these anti-New World Order birther people second
[3:12:46.380 --> 3:12:50.740]  amendment people know if the Republicans ran to that and ignored their lobbyist
[3:12:50.740 --> 3:12:57.020]  special interest they would then become the populist and be swept to power let's
[3:12:57.020 --> 3:13:00.340]  see the lobbyists and the media it's their job to keep the power all these
[3:13:00.340 --> 3:13:04.260]  politicians are not that smart they just follow what their advisors tell them who
[3:13:04.260 --> 3:13:09.020]  are a bunch of propagandists they try to demonize Ron Paul in a minute and
[3:13:09.020 --> 3:13:12.460]  Matthews being CIA says no no no no because they lost their fight
[3:13:12.460 --> 3:13:15.940]  demonizing him so they've now capitulated no no no he's not with
[3:13:15.940 --> 3:13:20.540]  them they don't want to give us quote anti-New World Order people the
[3:13:20.540 --> 3:13:23.980]  credibility of Ron Paul being associated with us they already tried to
[3:13:23.980 --> 3:13:29.260]  destroy Paul with Bruno and everything else it all failed this is very
[3:13:29.260 --> 3:13:33.780]  sophisticated so he's saying the river is low for the Republicans yeah but it's
[3:13:33.780 --> 3:13:37.340]  even lower for Obama and now the Republicans are talking about the New
[3:13:37.340 --> 3:13:40.900]  World Order and global government and carbon taxes and home inspections and
[3:13:40.900 --> 3:13:45.420]  national ID cards with all you buy sell and do LA Times New York Times today
[3:13:45.420 --> 3:13:49.780]  saying it's good and we need it it's happening it's total socialized control
[3:13:49.780 --> 3:13:57.060]  of your entire life under a fascist eugenics system so again they're the
[3:13:57.060 --> 3:14:00.820]  ones that are low they're the ones falling apart they're the ones that are
[3:14:00.820 --> 3:14:03.860]  stopping and having to breathe they're the ones dropping out of the marathon
[3:14:03.860 --> 3:14:08.100]  we're the ones taken over the Democratic Party and Republican Party with true
[3:14:08.100 --> 3:14:12.060]  populism and liberty against their corporate fascism their labels of left
[3:14:12.060 --> 3:14:15.540]  and right are see-through they got holes in them you can drive a Mack truck
[3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:20.900]  through their electronic Berlin wall is faltering it's shorting out and every
[3:14:20.900 --> 3:14:25.260]  time you speak the truth and ignore their lies they get weaker this pathetic
[3:14:25.260 --> 3:14:31.540]  guy is just tissue thick and so yeah all the political parties in the
[3:14:31.540 --> 3:14:38.140]  establishment are in crisis you're in crisis your riverbed is low and so what
[3:14:38.140 --> 3:14:41.900]  you see is the real grassroots taking over what's left of the parties and they
[3:14:41.900 --> 3:14:47.980]  are panicked go back to this little guy Republican Party right now and you're
[3:14:47.980 --> 3:14:51.260]  seeing the rocks at the bottom well I can't wait till somebody hits the
[3:14:51.260 --> 3:14:54.700]  question to or brings the question to Sarah Palin and maybe that's bringing
[3:14:54.700 --> 3:14:59.500]  cold a new castle but I mean I assume she will give something of a stutter as
[3:14:59.500 --> 3:15:02.380]  an answer here's that by the way what are your thoughts I can I haven't had you
[3:15:02.380 --> 3:15:05.660]  on the show lately so I want to get your DNA here you know they have something
[3:15:05.660 --> 3:15:08.740]  called the Minnesota multi-facing personality test which tests your sort
[3:15:08.740 --> 3:15:12.660]  of temperament and I remember taking the test to be an RA in grad school and they
[3:15:12.660 --> 3:15:15.740]  ask you questions but you'd like tennis or baseball that kind of thing you're
[3:15:15.740 --> 3:15:18.820]  out of play chess and indoor thing or go outside or whatever and then right in
[3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:22.620]  the middle what they say things like is someone chasing you right now and then
[3:15:22.620 --> 3:15:25.300]  is someone trying to kill you the interspersed those questions to catch
[3:15:25.300 --> 3:15:28.860]  the the full mooners I think a lot of these people who believe this stuff
[3:15:28.860 --> 3:15:32.500]  will say yes because if you believe this you probably believe the words and
[3:15:32.500 --> 3:15:36.420]  pause your thoughts see these guys are total control freaks and they can't
[3:15:36.420 --> 3:15:40.180]  stand the fact look at these full mooners they're mentally ill the
[3:15:40.180 --> 3:15:44.300]  psychological test show yeah he just mixes in something about a test so it
[3:15:44.300 --> 3:15:47.540]  sounds scientific they believe the borders are open they believe the
[3:15:47.540 --> 3:15:50.540]  government wants their guns they believe the banks are looting them they
[3:15:50.540 --> 3:15:54.540]  believe there's a Bilderberg group the Bilderberg's writing op-eds now in the
[3:15:54.540 --> 3:15:58.660]  in major papers calling for world government so they're telling the
[3:15:58.660 --> 3:16:03.260]  dumb-down TV watchers don't listen to people that can read just just they're
[3:16:03.260 --> 3:16:06.900]  crazy just stay on the reservation and they're losing more and more of their
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:11.340]  minions more and more people are going off the plantation oh god don't listen
[3:16:11.340 --> 3:16:15.740]  to them oh god oh finish it up we're going to tarpley are we talking
[3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:19.660]  psychological problems here with people are well yes I don't know I mean there
[3:16:19.660 --> 3:16:23.500]  are people who are certainly prone to embrace conspiracy theories we see it
[3:16:23.500 --> 3:16:28.300]  with the idea that 9-11 was an inside job we see it with the idea that the
[3:16:28.300 --> 3:16:33.380]  Bilderberg group meeting every year is in fact a global banking international
[3:16:33.380 --> 3:16:37.460]  banking cabal designed to institute a world government it just happens that
[3:16:37.460 --> 3:16:43.780]  a lot do these guys realize how they're politically destroying themselves I mean
[3:16:43.780 --> 3:16:48.980]  do they understand that almost everyone now knows about Bilderberg and it's all
[3:16:48.980 --> 3:16:52.420]  over the news and their own corporate minutes of leak and they brag they set
[3:16:52.420 --> 3:16:57.780]  up the European Union by covert stealth and that all of this is real he's up I
[3:16:57.780 --> 3:17:02.500]  mean they did the that's why they're discredited and falling apart because they
[3:17:02.500 --> 3:17:08.940]  just keep lying they don't even spin go back to it the folks who believe those
[3:17:08.940 --> 3:17:13.180]  things also believe the rest of them and and what Howard said is true I mean
[3:17:13.180 --> 3:17:16.860]  there are enough of them particularly in the internet age where they can be
[3:17:16.860 --> 3:17:20.580]  something of a force in politics and when the republicans have to watch out
[3:17:20.580 --> 3:17:24.820]  for because they will drag them down into this you know sort of more you are
[3:17:24.820 --> 3:17:29.060]  great and I'm falling in love you are great you've reminded me of all the
[3:17:29.060 --> 3:17:33.620]  erogenous zones of insanity I'm gonna go to Tarpley and we're gonna play the
[3:17:33.620 --> 3:17:39.820]  rest later but the see they're afraid of real politics real ideas breaking through
[3:17:39.820 --> 3:17:43.460]  not this fake left-right thing they've kept us locked in fighting with each
[3:17:43.460 --> 3:17:47.100]  other and so they say oh I hope the republicans get involved and get dragged
[3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:51.820]  in they're actually scared to death because all these years they said none
[3:17:51.820 --> 3:17:55.020]  of this existed now the public's finding out we're on the verge of a
[3:17:55.020 --> 3:18:00.860]  revolution a renaissance an awakening an enlightenment of understanding thanks
[3:18:00.860 --> 3:18:04.700]  to people like Webster Griffin Tarpley who said Obama was their man nine months
[3:18:04.700 --> 3:18:08.500]  before he was elected who laid it all out with Brzezinski laid out all the
[3:18:08.500 --> 3:18:13.660]  policies all the flip-flops a man ahead of his time laid out that he would
[3:18:13.660 --> 3:18:18.220]  stall within 150 days it's now happened he said he would have the lowest
[3:18:18.220 --> 3:18:22.580]  approval rating ever it's happened how on earth did you know this Webster
[3:18:22.580 --> 3:18:27.940]  Tarpley well thank you Alex I think it was mainly a matter of having lived
[3:18:27.940 --> 3:18:34.180]  through the Carter trilateral puppet regime back in in 1977 to 81
[3:18:34.180 --> 3:18:39.820]  seeing as big new Brzezinski back then seeing Paul Adolf Volker seeing all the
[3:18:39.820 --> 3:18:44.380]  members of the trilateral commission who were so prominent in the in the Carter
[3:18:44.380 --> 3:18:49.180]  administration from Carter and Mondale and Vance and and so many others
[3:18:49.180 --> 3:18:53.980]  Blumenthal at the Treasury and so on they were all handpicked by David
[3:18:53.980 --> 3:18:58.220]  Rockefeller and and Brzezinski this time they did it a slightly more
[3:18:58.220 --> 3:19:03.540]  sophisticated way not so much actual membership in the trilateral Commission
[3:19:03.540 --> 3:19:08.300]  although we don't really know but certainly the the guiding hand was
[3:19:08.300 --> 3:19:12.260]  there now you've got Adolf Paul Adolf Volker sitting in the White House and
[3:19:12.260 --> 3:19:17.020]  Brzezinski really running a lot of the policy through somebody like Robert
[3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:22.340]  Gates who was his office boy back 30 years ago who now runs the Pentagon so I
[3:19:22.340 --> 3:19:26.900]  think you're you're dealing with that now I think the good news though is that
[3:19:26.900 --> 3:19:32.060]  this has now stalled this this entire Obama hysteria seems to be
[3:19:32.060 --> 3:19:39.180]  disintegrating at a fairly rapid rate and he is now down to 49 but a corner
[3:19:39.180 --> 3:19:44.300]  dragon is dangerous with all of his host of hell supporting him all these
[3:19:44.300 --> 3:19:50.540]  powerful interests that are articulating this this this puppet what are their
[3:19:50.540 --> 3:19:55.020]  tricks their stage crises synthetic terror you told us what was coming a
[3:19:55.020 --> 3:19:57.780]  year and a half ago now tell us what's coming in the next year and a half

[3:20:27.940 --> 3:20:32.060]  this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in

[3:21:08.180 --> 3:21:12.820]  to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as
[3:21:12.820 --> 3:21:18.380]  strong just as well funded the Obama deception completely destroys the myth

[3:21:22.140 --> 3:21:26.820]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[3:21:26.820 --> 3:21:30.980]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[3:21:30.980 --> 3:21:36.220]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[3:21:36.220 --> 3:21:41.140]  that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government
[3:21:41.140 --> 3:21:47.860]  this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda

[3:23:53.220 --> 3:24:00.860]  the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[3:24:23.220 --> 3:24:39.380]  all right let's guitar play we were talking during the break obviously he's
[3:24:39.380 --> 3:24:44.500]  their manufactured messiah type that Brzezinski in between two ages wrote
[3:24:44.500 --> 3:24:49.420]  about in the 70s these kind of pop icon presidents they wanted to create kind of
[3:24:49.420 --> 3:24:56.980]  little hitlers their complete puppets not their own men as a Los Hitler was now
[3:24:56.980 --> 3:25:00.700]  that he's stalling and much of his agenda except for the hate crimes bill
[3:25:00.700 --> 3:25:04.540]  they got that that was the one thing they wanted to restrict free speech now
[3:25:04.540 --> 3:25:09.100]  that they're starting to stall this is a cornered juggernaut going for broke what
[3:25:09.100 --> 3:25:15.020]  do you see happening in your political crystal ball well the first thing is
[3:25:15.020 --> 3:25:19.140]  that Obama is now losing some of his core support right again 52% in the
[3:25:19.140 --> 3:25:23.300]  election allegedly be down to 49 it means that he's lost 3% of his of his
[3:25:23.300 --> 3:25:27.700]  actual voters which which is I think very very ominous for him let's just
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:32.860]  think of where we are we're in the first term of Obama and it's getting to be
[3:25:32.860 --> 3:25:39.380]  August where were we about this point in the previous president's first term
[3:25:39.380 --> 3:25:43.460]  say push he was on vacation getting ready to stage a false flag back here
[3:25:43.460 --> 3:25:48.540]  well having you know the rogue network was getting ready to deliver the
[3:25:48.540 --> 3:25:52.980]  false flag and hope that he got that he did what they what they wanted which he
[3:25:52.980 --> 3:25:57.660]  was going to do but we're now basically at the point where this 9-11 stuff then
[3:25:57.660 --> 3:26:02.300]  comes but comes back into play the the danger of false leg I would say is now
[3:26:02.300 --> 3:26:07.340]  rapidly increasing it has to do with the calculation on the part of these
[3:26:07.340 --> 3:26:13.540]  controllers right these trilateral characters do they wish to try to maintain
[3:26:13.540 --> 3:26:16.980]  this investment I mean if you if you look back at Bush he was already
[3:26:16.980 --> 3:26:21.580]  cratering at the point we're at now and then he was given a huge rally round
[3:26:21.580 --> 3:26:27.940]  effect by 9-11 and according to Gallup and others Obama is cratered faster than
[3:26:27.940 --> 3:26:34.660]  Bush faster than Carter so this is a record record cratering and so that
[3:26:34.660 --> 3:26:40.140]  brings false flag in it does and the the the the the model I think is this
[3:26:40.140 --> 3:26:44.340]  character Andrew Sullivan writing in the the Atlantic Monthly in December of
[3:26:44.340 --> 3:26:50.100]  2007 complained that the use of false flag was momentarily impossible for the
[3:26:50.100 --> 3:26:55.220]  Anglo-American ruling class because under under the circumstances of Bush
[3:26:55.220 --> 3:26:59.060]  Cheney nobody would believe them in other words if a bomb went off and Bush
[3:26:59.060 --> 3:27:03.700]  Cheney came out and said country X did it many people would say you're lying
[3:27:03.700 --> 3:27:08.540]  many people would say you're responsible you're incompetent or even you did it
[3:27:08.540 --> 3:27:13.500]  yourself as a wag the dog so that was the problem that that Sullivan saw with
[3:27:13.500 --> 3:27:18.700]  the the latter years of Bush Cheney now in the opinion of the ruling elite I
[3:27:18.700 --> 3:27:22.500]  don't think in reality because I think they're they're too optimistic they
[3:27:22.500 --> 3:27:27.140]  would say that Obama could blame another country for something happening and the
[3:27:27.140 --> 3:27:31.060]  world would believe it now the list has changed this is not going to be Iran
[3:27:31.060 --> 3:27:36.420]  anymore you will have seen that the CIA faction in Iran is in the streets yelling
[3:27:36.420 --> 3:27:41.140]  death to Russia death to China meaning Brzezinski's program so that there's no
[3:27:41.140 --> 3:27:44.900]  point in attacking Iran when you have a chance of taking over the government
[3:27:44.900 --> 3:27:49.660]  with musabi raps on Johnny and then using Iran against Russia China which is
[3:27:49.660 --> 3:27:53.980]  which is what the plan is but I would say it doesn't go well in the next few
[3:27:53.980 --> 3:27:56.980]  months they still may I mean we're getting all these green but right now
[3:27:56.980 --> 3:27:59.860]  that's that's still an open question but the one thing we do know is that
[3:27:59.860 --> 3:28:03.540]  there's bombing of Pakistan every day which is two and a half times bigger
[3:28:03.540 --> 3:28:08.180]  with nuclear weapons so I think actually much worse as a policy but I think the
[3:28:08.180 --> 3:28:13.900]  hit list is now Pakistan Sudan and then depending on how crazy they are maybe
[3:28:13.900 --> 3:28:17.500]  they go straight to China or straight to Russia and this would of course be
[3:28:17.500 --> 3:28:21.820]  active in calculable folly but that we're dealing with a little we already saw
[3:28:21.820 --> 3:28:26.100]  the Brazilian we already saw the Brzezinski Geithner crew already
[3:28:26.100 --> 3:28:33.460]  manipulating the bushes as you said with the 888 probe well yes and but the
[3:28:33.460 --> 3:28:38.580]  question now is that the hit list has changed and and these other countries
[3:28:38.580 --> 3:28:41.660]  are now at the top of the list so I would say now it's time to be double
[3:28:41.660 --> 3:28:46.140]  vigilant in particular the question of the drills and the exercises what I
[3:28:46.140 --> 3:28:51.100]  tried to show in 9-11 synthetic terror was that this is done through about 25
[3:28:51.100 --> 3:28:56.380]  plus drills either happening on the morning of 9-11 or just completed or in
[3:28:56.380 --> 3:29:01.780]  the advanced stages of completion and that is how it is done I mean people
[3:29:01.780 --> 3:29:06.220]  who have seen this this said the latest Tom Cruise movie when von Stauffenberg
[3:29:06.220 --> 3:29:11.460]  wanted to eliminate Hitler and have a coup d'etat how did he do it he took a
[3:29:11.460 --> 3:29:17.220]  pre-existing drill operation or program which was called Operation Valkyrie
[3:29:17.220 --> 3:29:22.420]  which was supposedly how to how to reassert Hitler's control over the
[3:29:22.420 --> 3:29:27.980]  German territory and other areas and he redirected it and and tried to use that
[3:29:27.980 --> 3:29:32.100]  as a means of kicking out the pro-Hitler faction now that yeah let's explain this
[3:29:32.100 --> 3:29:36.620]  is how you do it how they bootleg with drills and we have NLE09 going and
[3:29:36.620 --> 3:29:41.420]  other Defense Department drills openly training for martial law I mean on
[3:29:41.420 --> 3:29:46.620]  record with 14 foreign nations saying the foreign nations will aid suppressing
[3:29:46.620 --> 3:29:52.100]  American terrorists just unbelievable outrage against our sovereignty we're on

[3:33:12.500 --> 3:33:22.780]  hi Webster I was interrupting there with the break but I want to go over this
[3:33:22.780 --> 3:33:26.180]  because we already saw the Bush people and you were saying that was being
[3:33:26.180 --> 3:33:30.380]  manipulated already by the Rockefeller arm that was back in full control even
[3:33:30.380 --> 3:33:35.740]  before Bush left office with the 888 insanity sneak attacking a rushing
[3:33:35.740 --> 3:33:39.180]  controlled area on record and then hoaxing it and saying the Russians
[3:33:39.180 --> 3:33:42.940]  that attacked I mean just insanity I'm a political atheist folks we're just
[3:33:42.940 --> 3:33:47.180]  reporting the facts here and the course that later came out but the hoax work for
[3:33:47.180 --> 3:33:50.860]  a week the list some of the listeners thought that I was lying and that Russia
[3:33:50.860 --> 3:33:56.700]  had snuck attack I mean this is getting insane so what else do you see Obama
[3:33:56.700 --> 3:34:02.460]  doing I don't just see wars I mean could they I see them tarply scripting for
[3:34:02.460 --> 3:34:07.980]  right-wing militias gun owners anti-Obamas I see the programming by the
[3:34:07.980 --> 3:34:13.060]  ADL Southern Poverty Law Center to stage something that the government's gonna
[3:34:13.060 --> 3:34:17.380]  stage something I see the prescripting before it was been laudan prescripting
[3:34:17.380 --> 3:34:22.020]  before 9-11 and I saw that I see prescripting for them to go the domestic
[3:34:22.020 --> 3:34:28.540]  terror route with white al-Qaeda do you see that in the cards that that helps
[3:34:28.540 --> 3:34:34.540]  the the dictatorial agenda domestically and it gets you back to McVey and and
[3:34:34.540 --> 3:34:39.580]  that the whole universe of the 1990s that indeed in the 1990s under under
[3:34:39.580 --> 3:34:43.900]  Clinton that was the main form for example of British intelligence in the
[3:34:43.900 --> 3:34:50.060]  United States were up to their necks in white supremacists and and and all
[3:34:50.060 --> 3:34:55.100]  kinds of malicious so is German Intel it came out German intelligence on loan to
[3:34:55.100 --> 3:35:00.260]  the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center was running the groups BND yes right so
[3:35:00.260 --> 3:35:03.780]  but here's the problem with that is that that doesn't advance your your
[3:35:03.780 --> 3:35:08.100]  international agenda as much as you want as a matter of fact it hurts it because
[3:35:08.100 --> 3:35:12.500]  if you have if Obama is no longer the smiling peace angel bringing singing
[3:35:12.500 --> 3:35:16.700]  tomorrows to the United States but rather some kind of a stern a dictator
[3:35:16.700 --> 3:35:22.700]  who's you know shooting at crowds or something then then you get into
[3:35:22.700 --> 3:35:28.380]  diminishing returns and remember the main thrust of this has got to be when
[3:35:28.380 --> 3:35:31.420]  it comes to false leg is that you want to be able to blame it on somebody you
[3:35:31.420 --> 3:35:36.580]  want to somehow create for example a conflict among other nations and with
[3:35:36.580 --> 3:35:42.180]  it not necessarily the US that goes on the attack the neocon response to every
[3:35:42.180 --> 3:35:47.100]  crisis is bomb them with Obama and Brzezinski the idea is you're too weak
[3:35:47.100 --> 3:35:50.060]  you're too weak to do that you're too isolated you're too hated you're too
[3:35:50.060 --> 3:35:54.660]  bankrupt your military is overstretched at the breaking point therefore what
[3:35:54.660 --> 3:35:58.700]  you're looking at is questions like you know the playing of Ethiopia against
[3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:04.380]  Somalia was a small example the playing of enemy states one against the other
[3:36:04.380 --> 3:36:09.660]  just in another recent case in Urumqi right in northwest China we had this
[3:36:09.660 --> 3:36:14.980]  murder spree by the inhabitants of Chinese Turkistan who are basically
[3:36:14.980 --> 3:36:19.860]  Turks this led them to the killing of a whole bunch of Chinese this was run
[3:36:19.860 --> 3:36:23.340]  here by according to the Chinese government and I think they're right
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:30.140]  Rabia Khadir K-A-D-E-E-R coming out of Fairfax Virginia working you know with
[3:36:30.140 --> 3:36:35.420]  money from various US government agencies had been you know fomenting this
[3:36:35.420 --> 3:36:39.460]  stuff according to the to the Chinese government now the fact that the Chinese
[3:36:39.460 --> 3:36:43.780]  have cracked down in northwest China has led to a crisis in diplomatic
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:50.820]  relations between China on the one hand and Turkey Pakistan and Iran on the
[3:36:50.820 --> 3:36:55.020]  other it's causing trouble for the Chinese not only domestically but also in
[3:36:55.020 --> 3:36:58.140]  in their international and that's exactly what Brzezinski says in the
[3:36:58.140 --> 3:37:03.980]  grand chess board in the last book but but but expanding on that every time
[3:37:03.980 --> 3:37:07.900]  they use the Muslim extremist against the Serbs they use the Muslim extremist
[3:37:07.900 --> 3:37:12.420]  against Muhammad Mosaddek and Iran they're using the Muslim extremist and
[3:37:12.420 --> 3:37:16.500]  Iran the Shiites against the Sunni against the Shiites they're using the
[3:37:16.500 --> 3:37:20.100]  Muslim extremist in the United States is the pretext to take our liberties
[3:37:20.100 --> 3:37:24.220]  they're using the Muslim extremist with the president of Pakistan saying what
[3:37:24.220 --> 3:37:28.380]  do you mean I'm behind the Taliban they work for you menacing us I mean when is
[3:37:28.380 --> 3:37:33.820]  the public going to figure out that it's like those TV infomercials for the
[3:37:33.820 --> 3:37:38.940]  magic tool that does a hundred things is Wahhabist especially Wahhabist
[3:37:38.940 --> 3:37:44.140]  Muslim variant are they not the Swiss army knife Leatherman tool of the New
[3:37:44.140 --> 3:37:48.380]  World Order because in every case they are the ones and is that because they're
[3:37:48.380 --> 3:37:53.380]  so cultic that the low-level people don't even know they're being handled by
[3:37:53.380 --> 3:37:57.460]  higher level Muslims that are just Western intelligence operatives being
[3:37:57.460 --> 3:38:02.900]  highly paid I mean I mean is this the organic cultural perfect Manchurian
[3:38:02.900 --> 3:38:06.860]  candidate is the Muslim extremist because they're always the people
[3:38:06.860 --> 3:38:11.900]  wherever the New World Order is their vanguard is screaming turban heads well
[3:38:11.900 --> 3:38:17.020]  I think I think that that is is not able to capture what what actually goes on
[3:38:17.020 --> 3:38:20.940]  remember you can do this anywhere in other words you can you can generate
[3:38:20.940 --> 3:38:25.980]  patsy out of any culture under the right no no I agree but I'm saying over and
[3:38:25.980 --> 3:38:29.660]  over again they keep using Muslims but this involves the targeting and the
[3:38:29.660 --> 3:38:34.140]  targeting is for many reasons it's because the the Arab and Islamic
[3:38:34.140 --> 3:38:38.580]  countries tend to occupy so much of the world's oil the Middle East is this
[3:38:38.580 --> 3:38:44.660]  this area of conflict among any number of major powers there's also the fact
[3:38:44.660 --> 3:38:48.980]  that the British have been in command of India with a very large Muslim
[3:38:48.980 --> 3:38:52.940]  population for all of those centuries they have refined their techniques of
[3:38:52.940 --> 3:38:57.420]  brainwashing and manipulation in the words Wahhabism what is today called
[3:38:57.420 --> 3:39:02.660]  Wahhabism is something that comes out of British India in the in the 1700s
[3:39:02.660 --> 3:39:06.100]  that's a British Intel development tell folks about that well what the what the
[3:39:06.100 --> 3:39:09.220]  British of course do is when they take over a country they look inside the
[3:39:09.220 --> 3:39:13.260]  indigenous culture and they try to pick out the most backward elements and that
[3:39:13.260 --> 3:39:17.460]  goes for the religion or any other form of culture so what they will do is
[3:39:17.460 --> 3:39:21.860]  they'll take the most self-destructive the most self-isolating the most
[3:39:21.860 --> 3:39:26.260]  insane the most fundamentalist and they'll they'll then tell that population
[3:39:26.260 --> 3:39:31.540]  this is the real you this is your real cultural identity this is who you really
[3:39:31.540 --> 3:39:36.460]  are so they'll say to the Muslims your identity is not this great Baghdad
[3:39:36.460 --> 3:39:41.540]  Renaissance of Arun El Rashid with some of the greatest scientific advances and
[3:39:41.540 --> 3:39:47.340]  even Sina and and Al Farabi and and so forth they'll say that's not you you are
[3:39:47.340 --> 3:39:52.020]  rather Al Ghazali and his destruction of the destruction in other words you're
[3:39:52.020 --> 3:39:59.380]  going to be a a Sufi mystic not a Baghdad science scholar of 800 or 900 AD so
[3:39:59.380 --> 3:40:04.460]  the they then build on that it's also the fact that these areas right now are
[3:40:04.460 --> 3:40:09.020]  very poor and they've got a large young population in other words there's a
[3:40:09.020 --> 3:40:13.540]  very large majority of the population a lot of these places that's below 30
[3:40:13.540 --> 3:40:17.620]  years old a lot of them are peasants who have been coming into cities and that
[3:40:17.620 --> 3:40:22.660]  always creates a lot of friction and a lot of potential for permission yeah
[3:40:22.660 --> 3:40:27.180]  there's population explosion pressures and and what you're saying is you
[3:40:27.180 --> 3:40:30.940]  misunderstood is exactly what I'm saying they're taking the culture warping it
[3:40:30.940 --> 3:40:36.020]  creating a what's the same thing with Pol Pot that that Brzezinski brags about
[3:40:36.020 --> 3:40:41.100]  how yeah I use Pol Pot I picked him we built him up he killed 30% of the
[3:40:41.100 --> 3:40:44.500]  population that stopped the communist but then another level they were also
[3:40:44.500 --> 3:40:49.140]  funding the communists so anything to destabilize would you agree then they
[3:40:49.140 --> 3:40:54.060]  use that same culture type manipulation with with the Khmer Rouge saying we're
[3:40:54.060 --> 3:40:59.140]  going back to the rural society just like they say your Muslim culture is a
[3:40:59.140 --> 3:41:05.220]  Bedouin society kill the Westerner then they use them as a menacing pawn to set
[3:41:05.220 --> 3:41:08.620]  up their police states domestically and have a pretext to invade the Middle East
[3:41:08.620 --> 3:41:13.980]  yeah certainly and Al Qaeda if you look at what they preach it's the idea that
[3:41:13.980 --> 3:41:19.060]  there has to be a caliphate meaning that all the existing governments are
[3:41:19.060 --> 3:41:21.900]  illegitimate so that means that if you want to overthrow any of these
[3:41:21.900 --> 3:41:26.820]  governments from Saudi Arabia to Egypt or whoever it is according to bin Laden
[3:41:26.820 --> 3:41:31.060]  really a troop of actors all of those all of those places are illegitimate and
[3:41:31.060 --> 3:41:35.540]  at the same time you've got to be backward and at the same time you can't
[3:41:35.540 --> 3:41:40.500]  make alliances with anybody else you can't allow ally with Japan or Russia or
[3:41:40.500 --> 3:41:44.620]  China or Brazil or South Africa you're you're not allowed to do any of that
[3:41:44.620 --> 3:41:50.660]  because it makes them rigid so that they're now isolated yeah in effect so
[3:41:50.660 --> 3:41:55.660]  let's look now at the way in which this might be applied and here here it takes
[3:41:55.660 --> 3:42:00.860]  some some scenarios spinning but in order to to get something going at the
[3:42:00.860 --> 3:42:04.860]  level that they would like for the for the needs of now and now is not then
[3:42:04.860 --> 3:42:09.060]  now is not how do you bomb Iran that's useless you can do that anytime you want
[3:42:09.060 --> 3:42:13.420]  but it's got to be now and I think this is why this this coup attempt in Iran is
[3:42:13.420 --> 3:42:18.420]  so interesting here we have the green revolution we have Musavi who was the
[3:42:18.420 --> 3:42:25.060]  prime minister during the Iran Iraq war the Iran Iraq war is a good example of
[3:42:25.060 --> 3:42:29.140]  frankly of Brzezinski's methods and it started under Brzezinski for God's sake
[3:42:29.140 --> 3:42:34.940]  or very soon after he left left office so you you encourage Iraq to attack Iran
[3:42:34.940 --> 3:42:39.660]  part of that being to tie them both up to destroy them both you're also interested
[3:42:39.660 --> 3:42:44.820]  in consolidating Khomeini in Iran when he's showing signs of collapsing and
[3:42:44.820 --> 3:42:50.140]  the prime minister who presided over that eight years of war is Musavi and
[3:42:50.140 --> 3:42:54.180]  among the other things this was the time when the Mullahs would go around and
[3:42:54.180 --> 3:42:59.580]  get young kids to go to the front and become martyrs brigades they would rush
[3:42:59.580 --> 3:43:04.180]  at the prepared positions of the Iraqis with machine guns and minefields and
[3:43:04.180 --> 3:43:07.700]  barbed wire and they would just get mowed down there was of course this famous
[3:43:07.700 --> 3:43:12.500]  fountain of blood in Tehran to to memorialize these these martyrs that's
[3:43:12.500 --> 3:43:16.940]  Musavi now that's the that's the Anglo-American candidate of today so
[3:43:16.940 --> 3:43:21.580]  he's perfect because he kills Persians it's another eugenical he's been
[3:43:21.580 --> 3:43:25.460]  retooled I mean what he what he talks about now is internet freedom that
[3:43:25.460 --> 3:43:29.500]  there's got to be internet freedom and more privatization so he wants the full
[3:43:29.500 --> 3:43:34.340]  IMF shock therapy yeah foreign banks coming in inoculations for everybody
[3:43:34.340 --> 3:43:38.620]  now now Webster I I want to finish up with Iran but the time we've got with
[3:43:38.620 --> 3:43:42.340]  you I want to look back domestically because we're now seeing the Obama
[3:43:42.340 --> 3:43:46.660]  squads try to get people kicked off the radio we're now seeing them go after
[3:43:46.660 --> 3:43:50.500]  sponsors we're now seeing them say it's illegal to criticize them any
[3:43:50.500 --> 3:43:55.500]  criticism of health care takeover anything is racism I want to get your
[3:43:55.500 --> 3:43:58.860]  take on the health care takeover the carbon tax I want to run through a few
[3:43:58.860 --> 3:44:02.980]  bullet points with you and some other stories but go ahead well and on the
[3:44:02.980 --> 3:44:06.180]  major say one of the things that has got this going is this birth certificate
[3:44:06.180 --> 3:44:10.660]  issue and I would simply say this there's such a thing as the long-form
[3:44:10.660 --> 3:44:17.300]  vault copy birth certificate the original an original means 1961 original
[3:44:17.300 --> 3:44:23.180]  means with things typed in yeah not a receipt not a receipt not a receipt not
[3:44:23.180 --> 3:44:26.540]  not something that you heard Matthews I asked you during the break what do you
[3:44:26.540 --> 3:44:31.180]  think of him panicking well I I think that there is there is a hysteria in
[3:44:31.180 --> 3:44:35.780]  the Obama Kool-Aid cultist and it was in the world of these lemmings the Chris
[3:44:35.780 --> 3:44:40.740]  Matthews and others there is a genuine hysteria about this and it what would
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:44.660]  it encapsulate encapsulate along with some other incidents that have
[3:44:44.660 --> 3:44:49.900]  happened lately is their class hatred in other words it's an elitist hatred by
[3:44:49.900 --> 3:44:55.260]  these foundation funded intellectuals and and media types against what amounts
[3:44:55.260 --> 3:44:59.420]  to the u.s. population in particular blue collar workers and anybody who's
[3:44:59.420 --> 3:45:04.820]  involved in anything productive they think is is their class enemy and that's
[3:45:04.820 --> 3:45:10.180]  that's the hysteria that they that they they're afraid of independent farmers
[3:45:10.180 --> 3:45:14.540]  auto workers black white they don't care if you're a real man with a real
[3:45:14.540 --> 3:45:19.060]  family and normal they don't like it because they're the parasite economy
[3:45:19.060 --> 3:45:22.900]  that openly is wage I mean I was looking at the global warming funding and the
[3:45:22.900 --> 3:45:27.100]  it's all Goldman Sachs all JP Morgan like you said and it's in the new film
[3:45:27.100 --> 3:45:34.300]  coming up they literally are waging war against reality and the the the obvious
[3:45:34.300 --> 3:45:38.980]  tendency of a regime like Obama is to collapse into a kind of Carter
[3:45:38.980 --> 3:45:44.900]  catastrophic abortive interlude in other words a one-term presidency with
[3:45:44.900 --> 3:45:49.020]  with very high on popularity that then gets booted out and then of course leads
[3:45:49.020 --> 3:45:53.460]  to a period of ultra-reaction when you look at the Republican Party say under
[3:45:53.460 --> 3:45:57.500]  somebody like Mitt Romney the asset stripper and hedge fund hyena I think
[3:45:57.500 --> 3:46:02.460]  that's where that's where the republic of a fake left-wing into a kind of false
[3:46:02.460 --> 3:46:08.140]  libertarian corporate looting yes with the again Mitt Romney I think is is the
[3:46:08.140 --> 3:46:13.020]  face of what what is likely to prevail inside the current Republican Party in
[3:46:13.020 --> 3:46:16.740]  when it comes to these policies cap and trade it's very easy cap and trade is
[3:46:16.740 --> 3:46:21.980]  simply no no no no no and and and stop this completely when you get to
[3:46:21.980 --> 3:46:28.700]  health care you've obviously got Obama having really identified or revealed a
[3:46:28.700 --> 3:46:33.980]  genocidal mentality in the sense he talks about his mother's hip operation
[3:46:33.980 --> 3:46:38.140]  that she had been she had been ill with cancer but had a hip operation and
[3:46:38.140 --> 3:46:42.660]  Obama says that this was an ethical dilemma for him whether his sick mother
[3:46:42.660 --> 3:46:47.420]  should get a hip hip operation this is the guy who shovels trillions of dollars
[3:46:47.420 --> 3:46:53.260]  24 trillion so far across the room for for AIG and Goldman Sachs and JP
[3:46:53.260 --> 3:46:56.100]  Morgan and Citibank and the rest of these bandits
[3:46:56.100 --> 3:47:00.700]  Obama he sounds more and more like the president of the hemlock society he
[3:47:00.700 --> 3:47:05.220]  talks about hospices how much he likes hospices these are places where you go
[3:47:05.220 --> 3:47:08.580]  and they give you a drug cocktail and that's pretty much the end of you
[3:47:08.580 --> 3:47:13.020]  well that's what I was going to say Webster they keep saying this isn't
[3:47:13.020 --> 3:47:17.220]  government-controlled but then a lot of doctors are saying it is eugenics
[3:47:17.220 --> 3:47:21.740]  they're now saying we're gonna have an ID card that has what we eat what we do on
[3:47:21.740 --> 3:47:26.540]  it no I'm not kidding this is LA Times proposing it and that and that the
[3:47:26.540 --> 3:47:31.340]  bureaucrats will decide if you've lived your life right and if you get health
[3:47:31.340 --> 3:47:36.980]  care I mean and then they admit this is to lower the carbon footprint I have
[3:47:36.980 --> 3:47:42.020]  mainstream articles saying it's good for old people to die and Dashel I have his
[3:47:42.020 --> 3:47:47.420]  book right he says if you're above 60 no eye surgery and then I have video of
[3:47:47.420 --> 3:47:51.260]  Tony Blair when he was asked in the Commons hey you got away at 18 months
[3:47:51.260 --> 3:47:55.580]  for a brain surgery that's inoperable after six months but is 90% operable if
[3:47:55.580 --> 3:47:58.580]  you do it in the first two and he said yeah you don't need to have that you
[3:47:58.580 --> 3:48:03.780]  need to die it's not some Republican propaganda to say this is eugenics this
[3:48:03.780 --> 3:48:08.420]  is really happening it is now here's the problem though you do have 50 million
[3:48:08.420 --> 3:48:13.220]  people who have no no insurance and you have about 18,000 who die a year because
[3:48:13.220 --> 3:48:17.420]  they don't get health care but just in terms of Obama as long as you've got
[3:48:17.420 --> 3:48:23.620]  or sac up there the director of the OMB or sag is the guy who tells you that
[3:48:23.620 --> 3:48:27.180]  you should not have an MRI you should not have a CAT scan you should not have a
[3:48:27.180 --> 3:48:32.740]  nuclear stress test you shouldn't have a PSA or whatever it is this obviously
[3:48:32.740 --> 3:48:37.900]  also a genocidal sort of bean counting pointy headed bureaucrat mentality and
[3:48:37.900 --> 3:48:40.700]  then the other one is Holdren and this is really I think
[3:48:40.700 --> 3:48:45.820]  Oh that's what I meant to get you on about originally Webster stop exactly in
[3:48:45.820 --> 3:48:48.940]  fact when the crews come and interview you again final interview for the film
[3:48:48.940 --> 3:48:55.980]  I've done 17 now with other people. Holdren comes out with a textbook about forced
[3:48:55.980 --> 3:49:01.300]  abortion, forced sterilization, putting stuff in the water, CPS to take all kids
[3:49:01.300 --> 3:49:06.020]  to raise them in government, hive buildings, I mean actually everything in
[3:49:06.020 --> 3:49:10.980]  one document we already knew tell me about that. Well I've got his book
[3:49:10.980 --> 3:49:16.260]  Ecoscience and this is it's co-authored with Paul Ehrlich. Paul Ehrlich was the
[3:49:16.260 --> 3:49:20.620]  professor at Stanford University and absolute crackpot and charlatan whose
[3:49:20.620 --> 3:49:24.380]  his most famous book is the population bomb and he was talking about a
[3:49:24.380 --> 3:49:29.340]  worldwide population explosion and now here we are 35 40 years later there has
[3:49:29.340 --> 3:49:33.740]  been no such thing as a matter of fact the population in many parts of the
[3:49:33.740 --> 3:49:38.940]  world is falling certainly in European Union it's falling in Japan it's
[3:49:38.940 --> 3:49:43.500]  it's falling in the US it would be falling if it worked for immigration so
[3:49:43.500 --> 3:49:48.380]  this is this is Holdren he's basically a partner of the discredited crackpot
[3:49:48.380 --> 3:49:54.540]  Paul Ehrlich and indeed that was what they write about coercive involuntary
[3:49:54.540 --> 3:50:00.380]  measures to prevent population growth to get into the area of compulsory
[3:50:00.380 --> 3:50:05.620]  sterilization limits on families special taxes in other words it's a liberal
[3:50:05.620 --> 3:50:10.860]  totalitarian nightmare that they write about then you get a control freak orgy
[3:50:10.860 --> 3:50:17.660]  of just absolute pinheaded vampirism and I just I declare eternal war
[3:50:17.660 --> 3:50:21.100]  against these people. Yeah sure and that's clear in other words you can't
[3:50:21.100 --> 3:50:25.300]  have a health program created by these people however let me hurry to stress
[3:50:25.300 --> 3:50:29.700]  the reactionary Republican agenda is also fairly clear they would like to
[3:50:29.700 --> 3:50:34.740]  destroy Medicare destroy Social Security it's another form of eugenics it's a
[3:50:34.740 --> 3:50:37.980]  way of where you die and it's in the name of the market in other words the

[3:54:08.580 --> 3:54:12.540]  Germany was telling me that the show is really having an effect so is Webster all
[3:54:12.540 --> 3:54:17.540]  of us together. His newest book is Surviving the Cataclysm a compendium of
[3:54:17.540 --> 3:54:21.180]  the globalist activity, their banking, what they're doing, how to protect
[3:54:21.180 --> 3:54:25.940]  yourself. This is a great book we just got it in the bookstore it just came out
[3:54:25.940 --> 3:54:33.220]  Surviving the Cataclysm available at infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[3:54:33.220 --> 3:54:40.300]  Webster we ordered three copies of EcoScience none of them came it all
[3:54:40.300 --> 3:54:44.380]  sold out they returned our money but I got to a university was able to print
[3:54:44.380 --> 3:54:48.100]  off a eversion but you went to the library you were telling me got the
[3:54:48.100 --> 3:54:51.900]  actual textbook and you were saying during the break this is the Rosetta
[3:54:51.900 --> 3:54:56.780]  Stone the compendium of all their sickening eugenics break that down for
[3:54:56.780 --> 3:55:00.940]  folks what we're facing under the scientific dictatorship. Well this is
[3:55:00.940 --> 3:55:05.900]  now John Holdren who is the official White House science advisor to Obama
[3:55:05.900 --> 3:55:10.100]  special assistant to the president for science policy that's the office in the
[3:55:10.100 --> 3:55:16.820]  new new executive office building. This person is frankly a genocidalist he is
[3:55:16.820 --> 3:55:22.100]  an extreme Malthusian and the book in question is that it's a large textbook
[3:55:22.100 --> 3:55:28.300]  it's more than a thousand pages and it's co-written by Holdren with Paul
[3:55:28.300 --> 3:55:35.020]  Ehrlich now Paul Ehrlich EHRLICH this was a professor at Stanford University the
[3:55:35.020 --> 3:55:39.020]  most famous book that he wrote was called the population bomb meaning that
[3:55:39.020 --> 3:55:42.660]  there was going to be this huge increase in world population that this would
[3:55:42.660 --> 3:55:46.300]  become unsustainable and world civilization would collapse into chaos
[3:55:46.300 --> 3:55:51.740]  now this is simply baloney the guy's a crackpot and a charlatan there never was
[3:55:51.740 --> 3:55:56.540]  a population explosion right now population rates in Europe Japan and
[3:55:56.540 --> 3:56:02.900]  other parts of the world are going negative 1.2 1.3 it's so for every
[3:56:02.900 --> 3:56:07.900]  two parents having 1.3 kids it's the complete death of advanced Western
[3:56:07.900 --> 3:56:11.660]  cultures and in Russia so but many key parts of the world are actually in
[3:56:11.660 --> 3:56:16.380]  negative population growth now this is what what what they wanted so Holdren
[3:56:16.380 --> 3:56:21.500]  writes it with Ehrlich and Ehrlich's wife so it's a it's a textbook and it has
[3:56:21.500 --> 3:56:27.140]  everything in it it's their view on production technology agriculture
[3:56:27.140 --> 3:56:32.420]  population demographics the entire thing and it's all signed by this this guy
[3:56:32.420 --> 3:56:36.140]  Holdren who's now in the White House and what we have is compulsory
[3:56:36.140 --> 3:56:41.940]  sterilization compulsory vasectomies forced sterilization limits on
[3:56:41.940 --> 3:56:47.580]  families and again all of this with the idea that zero population growth the
[3:56:47.580 --> 3:56:52.940]  ZPG as they call it in the book binary chemicals in food and water so the
[3:56:52.940 --> 3:56:57.420]  elites don't get it we do yes sticking sticking all kinds of substances in
[3:56:57.420 --> 3:57:02.620]  food and water again vasectomies are good sterilizing women is good but it's
[3:57:02.620 --> 3:57:07.340]  more complicated and costs more all kinds of police state measures they
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:10.140]  actually have a table of all the different things you can do and how
[3:57:10.140 --> 3:57:14.180]  effective they're going to be and how how totalitarian and dictatorial they
[3:57:14.180 --> 3:57:20.060]  are I think this person is a huge target for public resentment and and indeed
[3:57:20.060 --> 3:57:24.380]  public political education to understand what this is because this is putting a
[3:57:24.380 --> 3:57:31.420]  true fanatic a true charlatan crackpot fanatic supporter of what amounts to
[3:57:31.420 --> 3:57:35.380]  genocide because that is what it means when you start lower is this not just a
[3:57:35.380 --> 3:57:38.960]  window into the main agenda because Webster you know we're on the same
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:43.300]  page in endgame I make the point every time I kick open the final door it's
[3:57:43.300 --> 3:57:47.380]  eugenics I mean that's these guys religion and a lot of other top scientists
[3:57:47.380 --> 3:57:50.340]  and professors are now saying the same thing in fact it was in the British
[3:57:50.340 --> 3:57:55.060]  news and Canadian news today that people I think are starting to get this I would
[3:57:55.060 --> 3:57:58.780]  say the eugenics is is is one of the one of the foundations of their
[3:57:58.780 --> 3:58:02.780]  ideology in the sense that they're an abacar key they need a way to define the
[3:58:02.780 --> 3:58:07.900]  majority of humankind as vestular subhuman and indeed that's what they do
[3:58:07.900 --> 3:58:14.220]  so therefore they are the elite but you are a candidate for eugenics and
[3:58:14.220 --> 3:58:17.740]  population reduction yeah folks this isn't a game it's happening get the book
[3:58:17.740 --> 3:58:24.580]  surviving the cataclysm at info wars.com or 888-253-3139 and get the Obama
