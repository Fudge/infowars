[00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:09.641]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.243]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.143]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:16.987]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:21.030]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:37.968]  Oh, we've got a powerful transmission lined up for you today, on this Wednesday, the 29th of July, 2009.
[00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:43.214]  Four hours spanning out before us, you have found at the front lines in the Infowar.
[00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:46.699]  Thank you so much for joining us again today.
[00:00:48.154 --> 00:01:05.964]  We will have wide open phones throughout the four hours except when Congressman Ron Paul joins us coming up in the next hour to talk about the carbon tax, talk of striking Iran, the socialized health care takeover, all of it, auditing the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:12.968]  We will discuss it all with Congressman Ron Paul coming up today.
[00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:21.748]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.329]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.570]  Wide open phones.
[00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.651]  Long-time callers.
[00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:29.611]  First-time callers.
[00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.112]  Callers that disagree.
[00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.433]  Callers that have a point they want to make.
[00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.794]  Callers that want to bring a particular news item or have a question.
[00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:39.956]  Absolute free-for-all for the next four hours.
[00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:41.116]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:49.921]  And just massive stacks of important news and information here in front of me.
[00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.562]  Let me just run through some of that news.
[00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:52.162]  U.S.
[00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:56.324]  10-year note falls most in seven weeks as record money supply looms.
[00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:57.445]  Bloomberg.
[00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:01.667]  Democrats say House may miss deadline on health care.
[00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.789]  Ah, and if it stalls into the August recess,
[00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:17.443]  Their total takeover of health care is in deep trouble and they admit now in the health care plan they're going to put taxes on meat, ice cream, taxes on you if you're overweight.
[00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:21.366]  This is the total nanny state socialistic eugenics system.
[00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:22.767]  Going to be breaking that down.
[00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:27.391]  It's in the LA Times and the AP today of course telling you how great it is.
[00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.493]  So we'll be going over that also.
[00:02:31.493 --> 00:02:38.280]  Maxine Waters, the Congresswoman, blames Rahm Emanuel for recalcitrant Democrats on the health care issue.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.342]  The guy just mentioned this, but here's the headline.
[00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:44.686]  CDC chief, soda tax could combat obesity.
[00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:49.691]  How about you take the mercury out of it that they add for some reason, according to the Washington Post?
[00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:51.412]  See, they put poison out there.
[00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:58.131]  This whole society starts rolling over and getting sick or dying, and then they come in with the eugenics.
[00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:02.938]  Oh, we'll just take over your society and micromanage your life.
[00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:04.600]  Tough love for fat people.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.783]  Tax their food to pay for health care.
[00:03:06.783 --> 00:03:07.023]  L.A.
[00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:08.365]  Times.
[00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:09.667]  And then it'll be every other behavior.
[00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.451]  Also, there's a story here out of AP admitting that the stimulus package gives the workers one-week jobs.
[00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:24.953]  And for every $35 that go to foreign banks, the American people get $1 of the chicken feed we're paying for.
[00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:31.474]  So it's like 30 gold pieces for me, 35 gold pieces for me, one gold piece for you.
[00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:33.194]  That's how it works.
[00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:38.716]  Government gets 35 silver pieces, slaves get one.
[00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:40.016]  And slaves pay for it.
[00:03:41.109 --> 00:04:03.696]  So they rob the bug-eyed yuppie middle class that still thinks they're part of the establishment and haven't realized they're on the chopping block like the Christmas hog, the Christmas ham, like a chicken running around the barnyard all happy not knowing in 10 minutes Mama Brown's gonna come out and grab the chicken and wring its neck and chop its head off and it's gonna be on the supper table.
[00:04:06.297 --> 00:04:13.622]  That's your know-it-all pathetic yuppie that won't defend themselves for the life of them, because they're members of the establishment.
[00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:16.784]  Talk about a sicko traitor, Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:16.784 --> 00:04:21.406]  I mean, Obama putting her in there.
[00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:25.629]  Just the assassination implications with the Clintonistas, because they're out for number one.
[00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:32.333]  They may be globalist New World Order CIA intelligence ops recruited in high school into college.
[00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.454]  That's on record with Clinton.
[00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.203]  Mr. Clinton teaming up with Mrs. Clinton.
[00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:42.085]  That's just a husband-and-wife CIA team.
[00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:44.306]  We have another CIA section chief out of London.
[00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:46.348]  It's all part of the record.
[00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:50.430]  Hillary saying she might run against ol' Obamanoid coming up.
[00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.772]  I mean, these traitors just never end.
[00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:54.773]  Or is it maybe all staged to begin with?
[00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:55.814]  That's New York Daily News.
[00:04:55.814 --> 00:04:57.455]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:58.636]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.574]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:09.597]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:15.502]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:16.142]  It's true.
[00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:20.566]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:27.111]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:30.333]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:31.034]  We're good.
[00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:02.186]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:05.007]  A New World Order.
[00:06:05.007 --> 00:06:09.509]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.730]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.531]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:18.712]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:26.015]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.483]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:34.483 --> 00:06:38.365]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.927]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:42.108]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.108 --> 00:06:42.868]  They're not after money.
[00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:44.169]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.130]  They're after power.
[00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.291]  That's what they're after these days.
[00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:51.054]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:06:51.054 --> 00:06:54.976]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:55.797]  In Game.
[00:06:55.797 --> 00:06:57.818]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:57.818 --> 00:06:58.899]  You have been warned.
[00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.739]  Yeah.
[00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:04.340]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.901]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:16.583]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:22.784]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:25.484]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:27.845]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:29.145]  I think so.
[00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:54.828]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:54.828 --> 00:07:56.471]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.823]  All right ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:54.074]  I was working on guest ideas out there during the three minute break and then I didn't watch the atomic clock and almost didn't make it back in the studio.
[00:08:55.512 --> 00:08:56.633]  Like running down the hall.
[00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:57.794]  They're like, get in here!
[00:08:57.794 --> 00:08:59.896]  I'm running with coffee in hand.
[00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:01.437]  Marathon runner.
[00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:04.720]  Quite a sprint, the 10 yards down the hall.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.563]  My exercise for the day.
[00:09:08.563 --> 00:09:09.344]  I'm just joking, folks.
[00:09:09.344 --> 00:09:10.725]  I'm actually getting back into exercise.
[00:09:10.725 --> 00:09:11.606]  I think everybody should.
[00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:15.749]  It's making my brain work so much better.
[00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:19.052]  Months ago, I passed the point of getting addicted to exercising again.
[00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:27.473]  And for years, I would try to go back in the gym, start jogging again, and could never get to that addicted point.
[00:09:27.473 --> 00:09:30.974]  Addicted to the endorphins, and now I am addicted.
[00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:33.675]  I'm like dreaming about another nighttime jog this evening.
[00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:44.860]  I had a nice jog this morning, and I'm just thinking about jogging around the neighborhood and the hill country tonight if I get the time.
[00:09:52.469 --> 00:10:17.299]  I want to kind of start the show today in a calm mode and just read the exciting headline from PrisonPlanet.com and a great story written by Paul Joseph Watson, Gallup poll, Americans turning against the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:18.520]  How exciting is that?
[00:10:20.003 --> 00:10:27.872]  I want to go over that a little bit later in the hour and talk about that with Congressman Ron Paul, who is coming up.
[00:10:27.872 --> 00:10:34.980]  And then, I don't just have Rob Dew, who does a great job producing, doing producing now.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.283]  I have Jaron Neihart and Paul Hartman.
[00:10:37.283 --> 00:10:38.665]  And let me tell you, these guys are on fire.
[00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:50.808]  They run the TV show slash radio show here in Austin, Texas, out of this studio, and then in master control, or I guess you'd say Houston, but it's not Houston, it's Minneapolis, St.
[00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:57.370]  Paul, is good old John Harmon.
[00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.052]  Oh my gosh, he is great.
[00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:06.614]  So he's up there in Houston, and you could say the guy's here in this office, or Cape Canaveral.
[00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:17.510]  As long as Marvin the Martian doesn't pop in, I think we're going to be just fine with this disintegrator beam.
[00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:24.213]  But, uh, they booked two big astronauts.
[00:11:24.213 --> 00:11:27.335]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:11:27.335 --> 00:11:34.318]  And then now I'm realizing that they're booking all these huge guests.
[00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:37.179]  There's a bunch of others that are lining up in the next few weeks.
[00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:37.900]  Of course, I don't want to
[00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:45.081]  Give a hint to, because we've done that before, or said who's coming on and people call and harass them or threaten them not to come on.
[00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:48.002]  Sometimes they don't.
[00:11:48.002 --> 00:12:00.548]  But now I've got to do all this research on the moon landings.
[00:12:00.548 --> 00:12:02.769]  Because I can't just have astronauts on
[00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:10.670]  And then just throw the question out, hey, it's the 40th anniversary a few weeks ago.
[00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.332]  Some people question the moon landing.
[00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:17.193]  So in a way, it's kind of bad to have producers this good.
[00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:21.736]  Because I just told them, go after whoever you want, go after whatever you think is big.
[00:12:23.502 --> 00:12:42.290]  And boy, it is scary who they're going after and who they're getting, because I'm busy trying to finish the new film that I will... I want to launch the website before I announce the name and put out a trailer, but I'm so busy finishing the film, I'm not even making trailers or websites or... Oh my gosh, it is such a doozy, the film we're making right now.
[00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.832]  It just... Each film just gets better and better, and this one is scary powerful.
[00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.693]  Scary cinematic.
[00:12:48.693 --> 00:12:49.533]  Scary good.
[00:12:51.493 --> 00:12:52.673]  But I went home early last night.
[00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:57.395]  I went home at 11.
[00:12:57.395 --> 00:12:58.676]  And then, it's addicting.
[00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:07.559]  I want to make film after film after film and get better and better and better and better footage and better and better interviews, but then I want to see my family.
[00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:09.300]  And I'm not trying to pontificate here.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:20.965]  I'm just trying to shift gears psychologically, mentally, in the tone of the show, at least some of the time, and not go into my kangarilla hopping around in the banana trees, thumping my chest.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.824]  Which I tend to do because I get threatened by the New World Order and threatened by the establishment at a very primitive level.
[00:13:28.824 --> 00:13:42.292]  You know, I intellectually... I intellectually analyze the facts and the information very coldly.
[00:13:44.144 --> 00:14:00.850]  And as you get deeper into the knowledge and research and understanding of societies and civilizations and propaganda and psychology and media and the way all these different art forms and sciences get mixed together in this dark alchemy of brainwashing and New World Order culture.
[00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:06.912]  It's a culture of plasticness and fakeness and metallic ozone stink.
[00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:07.672]  It's just...
[00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.929]  One cannot be told about the Matrix, one must see it.
[00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:16.450]  I know many of you have seen it, have seen large facets of it.
[00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:24.232]  The more I learn about it, the more I realize we have to fight the New World Order, we have to defeat it.
[00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:35.114]  But at the same time, it's pathetic, it's disgusting, it's stinking, it's mind-blowing.
[00:14:35.114 --> 00:14:36.414]  Congressman Ron Paul's coming up.
[00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:45.658]  In the first half hour of the show, next hour, unless something happens on the House floor that he may be on later, you know, it's fluid with these congressmen when they come on.
[00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:54.989]  But he's set for the show today, and he almost always appears when we meet him on the road.
[00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:56.991]  Is it the road to tyranny or the road to liberty?
[00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.572]  We decide that.
[00:14:58.572 --> 00:14:59.574]  We decide our fates.
[00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:15.197]  That is, we have a great say in our fates if we call to providence and stand up with courage and put on the breastplate of righteousness, the sword of truth.
[00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:26.481]  And if we endeavor and persevere and go through the tribulations of life, the slings and arrows, the darts, we tend to be given victory.
[00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:28.642]  Unless it's in God's plan that we play another part.
[00:15:29.551 --> 00:15:34.777]  But always the victory of liberty and freedom and truth lies at the end, if good men take the field.
[00:15:39.226 --> 00:15:43.870]  But one must be careful as you stare into the abyss that you do not become the abyss.
[00:15:43.870 --> 00:16:03.286]  I forget the philosopher that said that and when I read that as a teenager I didn't quite grasp it but now I can read all the great philosophers, those that touch the souls of us, those that tell us something that we've already seen but form it in such beautiful poetry.
[00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:04.427]  When you dance with the devil
[00:16:07.352 --> 00:16:10.873]  The devil doesn't change, you change.
[00:16:10.873 --> 00:16:28.199]  So be careful that when you look into the eyes of the siren and hear the song that you have an anchor in love and light or you will be destroyed.
[00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:34.141]  It's a delicate balance.
[00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:35.602]  Certainly is that, isn't it?
[00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:56.084]  And I have not done the best job at being calm, at being focused, at going to that deep, still water place that lies at the base of all our souls.
[00:16:56.084 --> 00:17:03.907]  But in that place, that quiet, still place, there is no more fear.
[00:17:03.907 --> 00:17:04.987]  There is no more pain.
[00:17:06.758 --> 00:17:13.622]  If there is a pain, it's only a lingering memory of what man was and what man could become.
[00:17:13.622 --> 00:17:15.924]  A sense of something older.
[00:17:15.924 --> 00:17:21.107]  A sense of being part of a creation, limitless, endless.
[00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:27.211]  Knowing that there are great secrets and great truths buried in our instincts and our DNA programming.
[00:17:27.211 --> 00:17:33.475]  That we are a great species and that our age is much greater than we are told.
[00:17:34.912 --> 00:17:38.773]  These truths speak to our hearts and minds and souls.
[00:17:38.773 --> 00:17:40.674]  They speak to the fabric of what we are.
[00:17:40.674 --> 00:17:47.817]  All right, I have massive stacks of important news here.
[00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.017]  We have loaded phone lines.
[00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:59.581]  We're gonna take calls throughout much of the four hours today that we're already 18 minutes into.
[00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:00.121]  On my mark.
[00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:16.230]  But I jumped out of the shower this morning as I was having a brainstorm and scribbled on the nearest piece of paper a children's book.
[00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:23.736]  I scribbled on the inside cover these quick bullet points to remember the brainstorm.
[00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:34.344]  And I want to go over these when we get back as briefly as I can.
[00:18:34.344 --> 00:18:38.427]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:18:38.427 --> 00:18:42.631]  And we're going to take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:49.077]  And then I will get into the eugenics grid.
[00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:51.079]  What Socialized Healthcare does.
[00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:54.922]  They are admitting the head of the CDC
[00:18:56.243 --> 00:18:59.624]  The head of the Department of Agriculture of all divisions, the head of the EPA.
[00:18:59.624 --> 00:19:06.325]  I remember reading this when I first really started doing a crash course in research 14 years ago.
[00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:11.487]  I had done a lot of research, but getting on TV and radio really has a way of focusing you.
[00:19:11.487 --> 00:19:20.409]  I remember reading federal government proposals to have a national ID card and a global system it's tied into that tracks everything you buy, sell, and do.
[00:19:21.616 --> 00:19:30.942]  On one front, to track everything you eat, your exercise, everything chronicled in government databases under socialized healthcare.
[00:19:30.942 --> 00:19:35.025]  Well, they're now proposing it.
[00:19:35.025 --> 00:19:46.312]  And then, you watch Chris Matthews or any of these channels, they say, oh, the conspiracy theorists say it's socialized healthcare, and they laugh at everybody, and they wonder why they're losing all credibility.
[00:19:46.312 --> 00:19:50.715]  People are going and reading the legislation, they're going and reading what the CDC says, I mean,
[00:19:52.273 --> 00:19:55.025]  You guys are completely discredited.
[00:19:55.025 --> 00:19:56.974]  But, I guess just keep up your lying.
[00:20:00.507 --> 00:20:07.852]  If the current state of the economy is severely impacting your life, this might be some of the most important information you will ever hear.
[00:20:07.852 --> 00:20:15.837]  As the economy continues to spiral out of control, many people, just like you, wonder how they will support their family and pay their bills.
[00:20:15.837 --> 00:20:19.479]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it.
[00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:22.962]  It's time for you to look outside the box and change your life.
[00:20:22.962 --> 00:20:26.384]  If you're tired of the get-rich-quick schemes, if you're tired of living
[00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:27.825]  Paycheck to paycheck.
[00:20:27.825 --> 00:20:34.308]  If you're tired of being tired, you need to pick up Robert Beatle's new book, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[00:20:34.308 --> 00:20:36.188]  Yes, Here's What You Do.
[00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:41.991]  This 72-page book will show you what you need to do to make the best of an economy that's in the middle of a recession.
[00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:42.932]  And the best part?
[00:20:42.932 --> 00:20:46.193]  This revolutionary book is priced under $10, and is only $6 for the e-book.
[00:20:48.434 --> 00:20:50.957]  Here's what you do to get here's what you do.
[00:20:50.957 --> 00:20:53.119]  Visit here's what you do dot net.
[00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:55.302]  That's here's what you do dot net.
[00:20:55.302 --> 00:20:57.284]  Here's what you do dot net.
[00:20:57.284 --> 00:20:59.367]  And start changing your life today.
[00:21:02.322 --> 00:21:03.764]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:09.831]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:09.831 --> 00:21:10.632]  That's right.
[00:21:10.632 --> 00:21:13.236]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.236 --> 00:21:20.424]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:20.965 --> 00:21:29.090]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:34.573]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:40.397]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:40.397 --> 00:21:44.900]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.140]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.001]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:50.243 --> 00:21:50.524]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.524 --> 00:21:50.724]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.876 --> 00:22:06.702]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.702 --> 00:22:14.290]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:20.437]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.857 --> 00:22:22.837]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.837 --> 00:22:25.318]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.318 --> 00:22:36.901]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:38.581]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:40.442]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:46.663]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:55.610]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.194]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.194 --> 00:22:58.376]  The people strike back!
[00:23:00.407 --> 00:23:03.949]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:13.576]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:20.420]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:34.147]  If you are ready to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:39.950]  Here is what one satisfied customer had to say about Heart and Body Extract regarding his angina pain.
[00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.132]  I haven't had an angina pain since I've been on it.
[00:23:43.132 --> 00:23:45.493]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[00:23:45.493 --> 00:23:50.156]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me, and that can do so much for others.
[00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:54.038]  Call to order your two-month supply of Heart and Body Extract today.
[00:23:54.038 --> 00:23:57.901]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBExtract.com.
[00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:08.010]  Alright, here are some of the bullet points I want to go over.
[00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.334]  Then we're going to take your phone calls, then break down this headline.
[00:24:12.334 --> 00:24:18.059]  Gallup poll, Americans turning against the Federal Reserve, the dollar starting to slide again, and a lot more.
[00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:31.836]  It is all coming up, but the number one point I want to make is when I talk about myself, humans are all very, very similar in all likes.
[00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:39.941]  So I'm talking about all of us together, whether we're awake or not.
[00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:48.907]  I intellectually and historically approach this information and research it in a cold calculated manner.
[00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:59.757]  And then, I'm good at researching it, and good at understanding it, and then people think I'm good at presenting it, but I actually don't think that's my strong suit.
[00:24:59.757 --> 00:25:19.350]  I then come on air and try to break down the full magnitude, and as I start connecting all the dots and laying it out, at a primitive level, I then become aggressive, just like a crab that's walking down the beach, and you run over to it, and it puts its pinchers up in defensive mode,
[00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:21.736]  I think?
[00:25:37.597 --> 00:25:45.040]  And the key to this, in shifting our paradigm, is understanding we really are all in the same boat together.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:56.065]  There are less than 6,000 super-managers and controllers, according to the head of the Kissinger Group and many other think-tank documents I've read, and public articles they write in the Washington Post.
[00:25:56.065 --> 00:26:00.947]  One article titled, Superclass, from last year.
[00:26:00.947 --> 00:26:04.449]  Where they brag, yeah, we're setting up a world government, we know best for you,
[00:26:06.241 --> 00:26:14.366]  And we're going to have a World Bank that controls every facet of your life and a carbon tax.
[00:26:14.366 --> 00:26:24.093]  And their argument is the public doesn't even want to have a debate about this and we can tell the public we don't exist while simultaneously telling intellectuals we do.
[00:26:24.093 --> 00:26:26.394]  And look at how the public then buys our propaganda.
[00:26:26.394 --> 00:26:30.937]  That is prima facie evidence that they are basically subhuman and deserve this.
[00:26:30.937 --> 00:26:32.939]  It's a very sick
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.563]  Intellectual rule they follow.
[00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:49.132]  It's kind of the old parable of a vampire has to trick you to give them entrance and invite them into the house.
[00:26:49.132 --> 00:26:54.837]  And though vampires themselves don't exist there are many divisions of sadomasochistic psychopaths
[00:26:57.017 --> 00:26:59.980]  Who are mentally ill and believe they're vampires.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.982]  And then there are other subgroups.
[00:27:01.982 --> 00:27:06.566]  That's really an archetype of the psychopath and their guilds.
[00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:13.173]  The intelligent, high-functioning psychopaths array themselves in guilds.
[00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:18.218]  And they like geometric shapes and marching armies in black uniforms and red banners.
[00:27:20.089 --> 00:27:21.931]  Red, black, and white are their colors.
[00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:23.814]  Those three arrayed together.
[00:27:23.814 --> 00:27:26.117]  And it just gets deeper into the psychopath's psychology.
[00:27:26.117 --> 00:27:32.445]  And again, from that point, I go off into the mass fractal overlay of their system.
[00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:35.781]  And grasping it.
[00:27:35.781 --> 00:27:36.902]  It's very hard to describe.
[00:27:36.902 --> 00:27:55.519]  It's like trying to describe to somebody a pastoral mountain scene or green hills or trying to describe diving on a coral reef and seeing a hammerhead shark, you know, a hundred feet below you and in schools of fish and Spanish mackerel.
[00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:58.141]  I mean, one cannot really describe it.
[00:27:58.141 --> 00:27:58.822]  One has to see it.
[00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:12.796]  So I can only give you little small brush strokes in the overall tapestry and the radio show itself will give you a deeper view into that over time.
[00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:15.938]  And then you will say, yes, I've seen that, I've seen this.
[00:28:15.938 --> 00:28:19.940]  Different little points of light in your own research, in your own life, in your own experience.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:28.224]  But hence the saying, one cannot be told about this matrix, one has to see it.
[00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:39.125]  And the globalists write books describing much of it and saying, oh, they'll even laugh at the rear and say, oh, maybe you're not with us, but you see it.
[00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:48.550]  But you notice your friends and family can't see you're someone who might want to join us, but they're not really offering for you to join.
[00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.251]  So that's another riddle and another lie.
[00:28:51.251 --> 00:28:55.613]  And even if you joined, the elite abused their own 6,000 servants.
[00:28:58.531 --> 00:29:04.156]  6,000 Super Gophers, less than 20 mega-families that rule them.
[00:29:04.156 --> 00:29:07.858]  And they have generation for generation of servant families that serve them.
[00:29:07.858 --> 00:29:25.092]  And their servant families, the Darwins and the Edgewoods and the Galtons and the Huxleys and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the Bushes and the Careys and the Brothmans
[00:29:26.783 --> 00:29:32.104]  I'm going to continue along this line.
[00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.444]  They're all intermarried.
[00:29:34.444 --> 00:29:40.806]  The elites, five or six generations in, will then marry into their super-class servants.
[00:29:40.806 --> 00:29:42.606]  And so it's like a breed of dog.
[00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:45.066]  It's like a breed apart.
[00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:47.267]  In fact, they write articles saying that about themselves.
[00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:50.747]  A breed of psychopaths.
[00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:52.128]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.128 --> 00:29:53.648]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.642 --> 00:30:00.428]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.428 --> 00:30:02.109]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.109 --> 00:30:06.854]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:06.854 --> 00:30:09.816]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:12.859]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:18.725]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:22.168]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:22.168 --> 00:30:29.175]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:32.458]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:34.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:30:37.583 --> 00:30:43.850]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.615]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:48.976]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:30:48.976 --> 00:30:49.597]  Take action today.
[00:30:49.597 --> 00:30:51.399]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:07.428]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.428 --> 00:31:13.310]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:19.453]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.793 --> 00:31:21.754]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:24.235]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.235 --> 00:31:37.419]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:39.100]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.941]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:47.183]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.845 --> 00:31:50.988]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to
[00:32:05.503 --> 00:32:06.064]  We're good to go.
[00:32:20.603 --> 00:32:26.764]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[00:33:21.414 --> 00:33:23.635]  Sweet emotion.
[00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:29.159]  We're going to be going live at PrisonPlanet.TV in 27 minutes.
[00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:31.420]  Phone calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:50.976 --> 00:33:54.938]  It is Wednesday, the 29th day of July 2009.
[00:33:54.938 --> 00:33:56.158]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:56.158 --> 00:33:58.960]  We're here Monday through Friday.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.740]  From 11 a.m.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.540]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.541]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:06.363]  We're doing abbreviated transmissions Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:06.363 --> 00:34:06.763]  Central.
[00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:22.546]  Again, very glad you all joined us today.
[00:34:22.546 --> 00:34:25.633]  I am fired up!
[00:34:51.016 --> 00:34:52.277]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:52.277 --> 00:34:54.538]  I catch myself just listening to Aerosmith here.
[00:34:54.538 --> 00:34:58.140]  I better knock it off.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.020]  Sweet emotion.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.822]  You know why I'm waiting?
[00:35:01.822 --> 00:35:10.867]  Subconsciously, it's for this part right here.
[00:35:10.867 --> 00:35:15.829]  This song goes out to the mainstream media whose ratings are imploding.
[00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:18.371]  As everybody gets anti-New World Order fever,
[00:35:20.862 --> 00:35:23.724]  And as we shake off the virus that is the New World Order.
[00:35:23.724 --> 00:35:30.467]  Uh-oh, the Rabidon died.
[00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:37.951]  All right, we are back live.
[00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:46.736]  You know these guys that run from women when the rabid dies?
[00:35:48.902 --> 00:35:50.202]  They don't know what they're missing.
[00:35:50.202 --> 00:35:51.263]  Kids are great.
[00:35:51.263 --> 00:35:54.684]  Marry that woman.
[00:35:54.684 --> 00:35:55.845]  Alright.
[00:35:55.845 --> 00:35:59.526]  Shut it down or I'm going to continue listening to it and commenting on it.
[00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:02.007]  Spoken word read to Aerosmith.
[00:36:02.007 --> 00:36:05.628]  Yeah, they would... What was that old pregnancy test?
[00:36:05.628 --> 00:36:12.411]  They would inject a rabbit with a woman's urine and the hormone would kill the rabbit.
[00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:15.872]  And that's why the term, if you got a woman pregnant, it was the rabbit done, died.
[00:36:17.489 --> 00:36:21.432]  That's where that term comes from.
[00:36:21.432 --> 00:36:23.673]  I get excited, I guess, when the rabbit dies.
[00:36:23.673 --> 00:36:24.454]  That's neat, man.
[00:36:24.454 --> 00:36:25.674]  Kids are great.
[00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:31.959]  That's more New World Order eugenics bull telling you wives and husbands aren't good and kids aren't great.
[00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.920]  The kids are the best thing in the world.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:42.025]  But I guess if you come from it, from the perspective of it's horrible, then you're going to have a terrible time.
[00:36:42.025 --> 00:36:45.708]  It's the best thing in the universe.
[00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:47.049]  It's God's greatest gift.
[00:36:48.047 --> 00:36:54.511]  Magical little creatures filled with wonderment and innocence and discovery.
[00:36:54.511 --> 00:36:56.932]  A gateway into the soul.
[00:36:56.932 --> 00:37:02.275]  A second childhood.
[00:37:02.275 --> 00:37:07.518]  We're meant to be like children throughout our lives.
[00:37:07.518 --> 00:37:09.399]  But a duality.
[00:37:09.399 --> 00:37:13.341]  Childlike, but also old and wise.
[00:37:13.341 --> 00:37:15.643]  Once the man, twice the child.
[00:37:17.856 --> 00:37:21.099]  Shakespeare again?
[00:37:21.099 --> 00:37:31.607]  Okay, let me go over these bullet points and then we'll get to your calls and all the news and Ron Paul.
[00:37:31.607 --> 00:37:42.276]  So, we have to understand that we do need to get emotional about this to give us the energy, the fire in the belly to fight the New World Order, but it's a combination, a balance.
[00:37:42.276 --> 00:37:43.437]  We need to coldly
[00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.172]  Look at the facts, though.
[00:37:46.172 --> 00:37:54.463]  A lot of people are emotionally wedded to the New World Order, or the Democratic Party, or the Republican Party, or to their preconceived notions, their worldview.
[00:37:54.463 --> 00:37:55.965]  They have cognitive dissonance.
[00:37:55.965 --> 00:38:01.373]  They are defending the ideas that have been put in their mind, the distortions, the twisted information.
[00:38:03.274 --> 00:38:08.197]  My goal is not even tell you what to think or how to think, but to get outside the box, take off the blinders.
[00:38:08.197 --> 00:38:14.600]  No one can deny that we don't know that much as humans on this planet about physics and the nature of the universe.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.301]  We learn more and more.
[00:38:16.301 --> 00:38:27.968]  We're a quantum level above our ancestors just a thousand years ago today, but no doubt our ancestors a hundred years from now, if we survive and become a type one society, we'll be an entire quantum level above that.
[00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:40.448]  There is a crisis in the paradigm, though, of human development and human society, the way we live, the way we operate.
[00:38:40.448 --> 00:38:53.359]  All of human society in our thousands of years of development is now being focused and accelerated, and there's more changes in ten years than there were in the previous hundred now.
[00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:55.641]  And the globalists understand this, and they are seeking to
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:18.899]  Irrevocably twist and alter the human species into their image as they play God on every front with their RFID and their drones and their drugging of the water and food and their GMO crops and their societal attack on the family openly saying they're trying to remove it and change it.
[00:39:18.899 --> 00:39:24.004]  The planetary government they want where all children will be raised in government dormitories and sterilized.
[00:39:26.035 --> 00:39:30.097]  This is official government textbooks, and we've listed them here at nauseam.
[00:39:30.097 --> 00:39:37.320]  Like Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar, John P. Holdren.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:54.808]  This is the real issue, and so we need to intellectually make our decisions and be political atheists who coldly analyze anthropology, sociology, and real human history, and read what the government propagandist hired by the Pentagon
[00:39:56.121 --> 00:40:16.438]  They're a top futurist like Marshall, and of course, currently, they have another top minion, Ray Kurzweil, and many others, and we have to look at what Huxley had to say, and Russell, and Wells, and countless others, and you read their philosophy that's all published.
[00:40:16.438 --> 00:40:22.222]  It is hell-raiser-sick!
[00:40:22.222 --> 00:40:22.683]  And whether
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:32.349]  They can actually manifest their plans, it doesn't matter, because they are going in that direction and they are in control of Ship Earth.
[00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:33.310]  Starship Earth.
[00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.254]  They are in control of Homo Sapien Sapien.
[00:40:37.254 --> 00:40:42.980]  They believe they're creating Homo Sapien Sapien Super Erectus, and they are not.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.044]  They are creating Homo Sapien Sapien Diablo.
[00:40:52.895 --> 00:40:59.458]  Homo sapien, sapien, Satan.
[00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:08.902]  A jealous, greedy, petulant, abusive, control freak creature, hell-bent on dominating and controlling everything unto death.
[00:41:08.902 --> 00:41:12.083]  A nihilistic nerve of power pressed on.
[00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:16.732]  You read the sick poetry of Lennon and all these guys.
[00:41:16.732 --> 00:41:22.253]  It's about how they want to destroy the Earth and murder people and drive spikes through everyone's eyes.
[00:41:22.253 --> 00:41:23.494]  It's all the same with these people.
[00:41:23.494 --> 00:41:35.997]  I mean, I've got some of their quotes, some of the top futurist quotes in Endgame about, we'll go on willing and destroy the Earth and murder everyone and we'll detonate hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and blow holes in the mantle and let the
[00:41:36.317 --> 00:41:37.638]  We're gonna open the gate!
[00:41:37.638 --> 00:41:39.719]  I'm not the one writing this and saying it.
[00:42:06.325 --> 00:42:10.528]  And they got Shiva, the god of destruction and creation, statue above it.
[00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:11.869]  I mean, have you read?
[00:42:11.869 --> 00:42:14.410]  Like, we ought to pull it up.
[00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.773]  The inventor of the nuke, of the A-bomb, is Teller.
[00:42:21.578 --> 00:42:25.180]  Like, you can YouTube, tell her, I am the God Shiva.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.282]  The Goddess of Destruction.
[00:42:27.282 --> 00:42:28.042]  Like, YouTube that.
[00:42:28.042 --> 00:42:28.742]  We ought to pull that up.
[00:42:28.742 --> 00:42:33.465]  He's like, we were the creators of destroyers of worlds.
[00:42:33.465 --> 00:42:43.992]  And he starts going... I mean, folks, you need to know what you're facing.
[00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:54.591]  That was strange.
[00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:56.772]  All the lights just went off in the studio.
[00:42:56.772 --> 00:43:00.934]  They just came back on.
[00:43:00.934 --> 00:43:03.675]  I mean, the more I research these people, it's like a bad dream.
[00:43:03.675 --> 00:43:05.736]  It just, it is insane.
[00:43:05.736 --> 00:43:07.417]  They are the ones that are insane.
[00:43:15.538 --> 00:43:18.138]  And they know how to manipulate your psychology.
[00:43:18.138 --> 00:43:22.459]  They have you in arrested development like a child, but in kind of a false childhood.
[00:43:22.459 --> 00:43:44.083]  Everything's a counterfeit of happy and fun and the teleprompter reading info babes laugh and smile and everything's giggly and funny on the different morning shows and nighttime shows and it's all about distraction and diversion and just caring about yourself, not knowing that when you don't care about anybody but yourself, you lose yourself and become enslaved because nobody else cares about anybody.
[00:43:47.418 --> 00:43:53.002]  When you don't care about anybody else, you become a slave.
[00:43:53.002 --> 00:43:58.285]  And so they take your human instinct to defend the young, the weak, the widows, the innocent.
[00:43:58.285 --> 00:44:00.887]  They take your warrior spirit, your protector spirit.
[00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:18.515]  And both men and women have that spirit, that template, that idea, burned across our brains and they take it and they say, oh don't eat, or don't hunt, don't fish, be a vegetarian, it's abusive to eat fish, it's abusive to eat meat.
[00:44:18.515 --> 00:44:24.616]  And I'm not saying that I look down on vegetarians, I think that's great.
[00:44:24.616 --> 00:44:25.977]  If that's your choice and what you do.
[00:44:27.435 --> 00:44:34.574]  But you have to understand they're already putting animal DNA into your food, so they've made it something far worse than even some GMO beef.
[00:44:35.492 --> 00:44:36.673]  Let's see, there's wheels within wheels.
[00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:41.236]  The point is they give you a fake template of, oh my god, you're hunting?
[00:44:41.236 --> 00:44:42.336]  You hunt deer?
[00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:44.178]  You hunt rabbits?
[00:44:44.178 --> 00:44:45.278]  Yeah, they instantly die.
[00:44:45.278 --> 00:44:48.120]  It's not that you enjoy killing the animal, it's your instinct.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:45:01.169]  And when you go out and hunt and get in a blind and shoot a deer at a hundred yards away with a bow, it triggers other primitive areas of the brain that then tie into the more advanced levels of the cerebral cortex and unlocks other
[00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:08.054]  Things like your peripheral eyesight, when you begin hunting, turns on.
[00:45:08.054 --> 00:45:15.079]  Your capacity to see.
[00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:20.964]  I've done studies on this, you know, the hidden images, those pictures they have, those psychological tests.
[00:45:32.728 --> 00:45:37.911]  So, it's what you're meant to do, it's what you're designed to do.
[00:45:37.911 --> 00:45:39.953]  But, oh no, going to the store and picking up the meat.
[00:45:39.953 --> 00:45:54.742]  You know, the worst people are the ones that don't hunt and think it's evil, but then they go buy the chicken that lived in a torture cage, or they go buy the beef, or they go buy the fish or whatever, and then, but still holier than thou, walk around griping at people that actually go out and do it themselves.
[00:45:54.742 --> 00:45:58.545]  See, it's a war against being human, being primitive.
[00:45:59.522 --> 00:46:03.083]  And saying primitive is bad when actually primitive is advanced.
[00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:05.864]  Because primitive isn't primitive, it's just being human.
[00:46:05.864 --> 00:46:14.167]  So if we took the primitive instincts and ideas and systems and used them in a modern context, that is the Superman.
[00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:24.651]  But instead they tell you modern is a closed-minded, stunted, weak, domesticated creature.
[00:46:24.651 --> 00:46:26.652]  But that's only one side issue.
[00:46:26.652 --> 00:46:27.772]  The main point about
[00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.571]  And this is just one window into thousands of points they do on this.
[00:46:32.571 --> 00:46:34.912]  Oh, I'm a good loving human being.
[00:46:34.912 --> 00:46:39.434]  I don't eat meat or I don't hunt.
[00:46:39.434 --> 00:46:45.396]  But then the people that are always against eating meat or always against hunting seem to always be for abortion.
[00:46:45.396 --> 00:46:52.259]  And they smile and giggle and lick their lips like it's a special right and you're not going to stop them killing their babies.
[00:46:52.259 --> 00:46:54.640]  If you really love life so much,
[00:46:56.084 --> 00:47:02.934]  Then why are you for killing your own species and lying and saying it's not a human?
[00:47:02.934 --> 00:47:06.139]  Why don't you adopt those third trimester of babies?
[00:47:06.139 --> 00:47:09.464]  Why don't you adopt them out?
[00:47:09.464 --> 00:47:10.285]  People want them.
[00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:11.828]  See, it's all a lie.
[00:47:12.068 --> 00:47:16.970]  The lovers of death, the lovers of saying, oh, we got to have eugenics and exterminate most of the humans.
[00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.090]  It's for the Earth.
[00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.972]  Then you find out the top eugenicists actually are saying, no, we're playing God.
[00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:24.693]  We're going to genetically re-engineer the whole planet.
[00:47:24.693 --> 00:47:31.696]  We just want to get rid of the rest of humanity because they're dumb and subhuman and don't deserve the life extension technology and the future is ours.
[00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:42.960]  And so the sicko, techno, neo-eugenicist, transhumanist, they come to the rest of the public and say, we want to sell you on saving the earth.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.961]  Get rid of yourselves.
[00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:55.186]  And they take your very instinct to be a good steward of the land and to protect the environment and take care of yourself and your family that's part of the environment and to not poison the environment.
[00:47:55.186 --> 00:48:01.929]  And they turn that against your very life force instinct and reprogram your life force instinct to now kill yourself.
[00:48:03.086 --> 00:48:03.967]  That's survival.
[00:48:03.967 --> 00:48:09.953]  So they take, and that was naturally there, to defend the tribe, the warriors may have to die.
[00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:15.598]  The needs of the few, you know, are outweighed by the needs of the many.
[00:48:15.598 --> 00:48:20.723]  Or the needs of the one are outweighed by the needs of the many of the few.
[00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:23.926]  Which is true if it's selflessly directed.
[00:48:23.926 --> 00:48:27.550]  But see, they take that and misdirect it from their programmed system.
[00:48:28.737 --> 00:48:29.738]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:48:29.738 --> 00:48:32.900]  We're going to do that at the bottom of the next hour after Ron Paul leaves us.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.782]  I need to continue on this line so the callers can hang up and call back if they want to.
[00:48:36.782 --> 00:48:41.545]  They can stay there.
[00:48:41.545 --> 00:48:45.628]  But I distract again from the main issue I was covering.
[00:48:45.628 --> 00:48:47.049]  I divert myself from it.
[00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:52.473]  The point is, these are the truths and the systems and the algorithms that the enemy uses.
[00:48:52.473 --> 00:48:57.596]  They take your natural instincts, your natural self-defense mechanisms and turn them in against you.
[00:49:00.794 --> 00:49:17.038]  It's like our vaccines, most of their soft kill weapons, are designed around triggering autoimmune responses that attack the pancreas of the brain or the uterus of the testicles.
[00:49:17.038 --> 00:49:22.319]  This is a very, very dark logic, a dark genius the enemy has.
[00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:24.060]  You have to respect them and also
[00:49:26.317 --> 00:49:29.599]  Realize that they are committed to their cause.
[00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:37.843]  And quite simply, if you read the philosophy, none of the Bible.
[00:49:37.843 --> 00:49:39.143]  The Congressman's going to vote.
[00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:40.024]  We gotta get him on right now.
[00:49:40.024 --> 00:49:44.426]  Oh.
[00:49:44.426 --> 00:49:45.026]  That's fine.
[00:49:45.026 --> 00:49:46.647]  I just, I don't get my full 30 minutes.
[00:49:46.647 --> 00:49:48.608]  Well, that's how it is when he's on the floor.
[00:49:48.608 --> 00:49:50.029]  I'm gonna get a whole hour from the Congressman.
[00:49:50.922 --> 00:49:52.803]  I'll go through all these other points later.
[00:49:52.803 --> 00:49:53.744]  We'll do your calls.
[00:49:53.744 --> 00:49:54.605]  I want to refocus.
[00:49:54.605 --> 00:49:55.365]  Kind of go through these bullets.
[00:49:55.365 --> 00:49:56.726]  There's a bunch of bullet points.
[00:49:56.726 --> 00:49:58.327]  Get into all the news.
[00:49:58.327 --> 00:50:00.149]  But the globalists are sociologists.
[00:50:00.149 --> 00:50:01.129]  They're anthropologists.
[00:50:01.129 --> 00:50:07.394]  They understand what they are doing.
[00:50:07.394 --> 00:50:09.955]  And they know what makes humans tick.
[00:50:09.955 --> 00:50:12.057]  They understand how we operate.
[00:50:12.057 --> 00:50:14.018]  And they are just cold-bloodedly doing that.
[00:50:14.018 --> 00:50:19.082]  We have to realize that 99.99% of us are in the same boat together against the globalists.
[00:50:20.174 --> 00:50:30.043]  We have to understand that we're all together as humanity against a few thousand global controllers.
[00:50:30.043 --> 00:50:32.005]  I'm gonna go ahead and skip.
[00:50:32.005 --> 00:50:34.007]  John, I should have given you a heads up.
[00:50:34.007 --> 00:50:35.588]  I'm gonna skip this network break right now.
[00:50:36.564 --> 00:50:42.126]  So we're going to fade the music down, because I don't know how long we've got him, and we've got Congressman Ron Paul with us.
[00:50:42.126 --> 00:50:48.389]  I apologize to the stations, but this is a network break, so we are taking this network break with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:50:48.389 --> 00:50:53.991]  He's voting today, about to have to run on the floor, and so he's having to come on a bit early.
[00:50:53.991 --> 00:50:55.892]  Congressman, great to have you on with us here, sir.
[00:50:57.961 --> 00:50:59.701]  Good to have you here.
[00:50:59.701 --> 00:51:08.083]  Gallup poll shows that now a majority of Americans would abolish the Federal Reserve if they could, according to CNBC.
[00:51:08.083 --> 00:51:12.064]  Can you comment on this exciting development, Congressman?
[00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:13.525]  Well, I think it's rather amazing.
[00:51:13.525 --> 00:51:19.646]  You know, a year or two ago, I imagine very few people even thought about the Federal Reserve.
[00:51:19.646 --> 00:51:27.368]  But I think because of the economic crisis, because of the blundering with TARP funds where the American people said, we need to know what you guys are doing and how you're wasting the money,
[00:51:28.088 --> 00:51:34.733]  We saw an opening that we could call attention to the American people about what kind of shenanigans have been going on in the Federal Reserve.
[00:51:34.733 --> 00:51:46.801]  And that, along with the presidential campaign, all of a sudden the Federal Reserve now has become a key issue, which is something you and I have been arguing for a good many years, and of course it was the issue that prompted me to go into politics.
[00:51:46.801 --> 00:51:51.464]  And lo and behold, now it's front and center in the debate.
[00:51:51.464 --> 00:51:53.386]  And there's a lot more yet to come.
[00:51:54.207 --> 00:51:55.549]  We need to know what they're doing.
[00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:57.833]  That's why our audit bill is so important.
[00:51:57.833 --> 00:52:00.998]  But eventually, though, we need a sound monetary system.
[00:52:00.998 --> 00:52:05.986]  And I think if we continue with our progress, hopefully we'll reach that point someday.
[00:52:06.997 --> 00:52:12.722]  Congressman, you said back during the campaign in 2008, something big is happening.
[00:52:12.722 --> 00:52:23.232]  And I even tend to underestimate, I've been telling you for years that I think we're starting to win, and you've been optimistic, but also somewhat conservative, saying, well, let's just keep working.
[00:52:23.993 --> 00:52:26.075]  Do you revise your forecast?
[00:52:26.075 --> 00:52:31.801]  I mean, that the something big you talked about is even bigger than we had even hoped and happening quicker?
[00:52:31.801 --> 00:52:37.547]  I mean, I think this is something bordering on 1776 or what happened to Ceausescu in Romania.
[00:52:37.547 --> 00:52:41.652]  I think it's more explosive than even you or I may have thought previously.
[00:52:42.315 --> 00:52:57.742]  Yeah, and I don't pretend to know exactly what will happen and when, but you know when you distort things grossly, so like we have for 35 years, you know it has to give, and at that time it wasn't clear-cut exactly what would happen.
[00:52:57.742 --> 00:53:04.405]  So the financial crisis hit, the House of Cards has come down, and that is really pretty big is what's going on.
[00:53:04.405 --> 00:53:11.569]  But no, I think it's even bigger than that in both the negative and the positive side, because I think we're working now on the dollar crisis.
[00:53:12.089 --> 00:53:18.453]  And the dollar crisis will be ten times, it will be a ten times bigger event than the financial collapse.
[00:53:18.453 --> 00:53:22.656]  And then, the big deal will be, which way are we going to go?
[00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:31.041]  Are we going to say as Americans that, you know, we had a taste of freedom, we want our freedom back and we want constitutional law and we want sound money?
[00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:38.986]  Or are we going to be complacent and the majority of people say, yes, let the government do whatever they want, they'll take care of us, we trust the government.
[00:53:39.546 --> 00:53:49.453]  So we're in the midst of that and I'm hoping, like you are, that we can win this fight and people opt for more freedom rather than more dependency.
[00:53:49.453 --> 00:53:56.597]  But we're a little bit off from that because right now in Washington, everybody's still pushing more government.
[00:53:56.597 --> 00:54:05.843]  I mean, just look at what Obama's doing with more war, more spending, more borrowing, more socialized medicine, more cap and trade, more taxes.
[00:54:08.585 --> 00:54:21.551]  At home, when I go home or around the country or talk on radio shows, I find out that there's literally not tens of thousands, but literally millions of people who understand exactly what's going on, and they've had enough.
[00:54:21.551 --> 00:54:28.575]  And I think this spontaneity with some of these tea parties shows that there's a lot of people very upset with what's going on.
[00:54:29.514 --> 00:54:45.709]  Well yes sir, we've gone in the last year from the media laughing at anti-federal reserve movement and the anti-globalist movement to now openly on the news every night they're saying they're scared the establishment is openly up there on their parapets the control left-right paradigm admitting
[00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:51.751]  That this movement is like a bushfire set in the minds of men, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:54:51.751 --> 00:55:03.996]  I mentioned the poll, the scientific poll, there's Gallup's and others showing that below 50% for the Federal Reserve now and growing.
[00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:12.959]  Obama and his approval rating now the lowest of any modern president at this point six months in to office.
[00:55:12.959 --> 00:55:22.422]  It just looks like government on every front is in free fall unless you're pro-liberty libertarian like yourself and your numbers are just going off the chart.
[00:55:22.422 --> 00:55:29.784]  Infowars.com numbers, my radio show is being picked up by more and more stations, this show is exploding, every other indicator is.
[00:55:29.784 --> 00:55:31.045]  Liberty is rising
[00:55:31.445 --> 00:55:45.276]  I think one of the best symbols of what you're talking about is the fact that the Fed feels so much on the defense.
[00:55:45.276 --> 00:55:50.521]  They sent the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board out to have a whole town hall meeting.
[00:55:51.521 --> 00:55:53.502]  That is hilarious.
[00:55:53.502 --> 00:55:58.365]  That also shows that they're on the defensive and we're on the offensive.
[00:55:58.365 --> 00:55:59.786]  But we have two on our side.
[00:55:59.786 --> 00:56:12.313]  I mean, the absurdity that they can control us forever by just printing money and claiming that they will always have wealth by printing money, it's so absurd that the people realize this.
[00:56:13.834 --> 00:56:22.686]  I think since we have honest money and truth and limited government and freedom on our side, if we don't win, there's something awfully wrong with us.
[00:56:22.686 --> 00:56:26.311]  And yet, I think, obviously, we're making great progress.
[00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:33.574]  Well, I think knowing we can win and historically having some victories, that is always what leads to the victory.
[00:56:33.574 --> 00:56:42.299]  Having right on your side, having history, common sense, free market, and then having victories and seeing that we can actually go up against these people.
[00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:43.060]  It's very exciting.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.061]  I mean, the fight is just now starting.
[00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:47.683]  I'm not saying it's easy, but I think the momentum is starting to shift.
[00:56:47.683 --> 00:56:49.164]  Sir, you've talked a lot.
[00:56:49.884 --> 00:56:58.990]  Previously about stage crises, Gulf of Tonkin type events, they're now green-lighting, Biden and others saying, yeah, we will support Israel, they have a right to hit Iran.
[00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:10.897]  Economic crises, economic terrorism, paying banks not to lend, as Kucinich has been covering, your fellow congressman, what tricks do they have up their sleeves, or are you concerned about stage crises?
[00:57:11.772 --> 00:57:27.635]  Yeah, I'm concerned, but I don't have any insight to what they plan or what they will do, and it may be an accident that they will play on or blow up or react to, so it doesn't necessarily have to be absolutely contrived.
[00:57:27.635 --> 00:57:28.196]  They may have
[00:57:28.736 --> 00:57:37.461]  You know, an accidental confrontation or sometimes they'll just go out and something gets blown up and this will excite the people.
[00:57:37.461 --> 00:57:58.214]  But I don't have any immediate insights, but I'm always on the alert and vigilant because, you know, because we're so vulnerable, we're so much involved around the world, all kinds of things could break loose and overnight the political and the economic environment could change rather quickly.
[00:57:58.414 --> 00:58:01.538]  Well it's like Rahm Emanuel said to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:58:01.538 --> 00:58:03.720]  He said we don't want to let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.903]  So created or opportunistically used.
[00:58:06.903 --> 00:58:08.425]  What about economic terrorism?
[00:58:08.425 --> 00:58:13.991]  Back in October they said give us unlimited power in the banking or there's going to be a depression and the stock market plunged 777 points.
[00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:14.712]  Is that not economic terrorism?
[00:58:18.275 --> 00:58:28.303]  It is and if it doesn't have enough fear and put enough fear in the heart of the people, they'll create the fear because people succumb and they give up their liberties when they're very fearful.
[00:58:28.303 --> 00:58:34.388]  So that's what we have to convince the people that they should not be doing is sacrificing their liberties for their security.
[00:58:34.388 --> 00:58:36.750]  Congressman, I know you have a vote coming up any minute.
[00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:38.151]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:38.151 --> 00:58:39.492]  Let me speak to you during the break.
[00:58:39.492 --> 00:58:42.895]  Okay.
[00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:44.376]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.353 --> 00:58:50.275]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.275 --> 00:58:54.517]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.517 --> 00:58:56.518]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.518 --> 00:59:05.042]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:10.585]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.585 --> 00:59:12.206]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.446 --> 00:59:18.968]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:18.968 --> 00:59:30.010]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:30.791]  That's right.
[00:59:30.791 --> 00:59:33.351]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:34.932]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.872 --> 00:59:37.332]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.372 --> 01:00:08.133]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:09.895]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.895 --> 01:00:11.476]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.476 --> 01:00:13.037]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.037 --> 01:00:17.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:22.123]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:24.665]  I talked to the Congressman during that one-minute break.
[01:00:24.665 --> 01:00:29.448]  He said, Alex, I'm sorry, I'll come on for 30 minutes next week.
[01:00:29.448 --> 01:00:30.109]  Gotta go.
[01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:32.050]  I got two minutes to get to the floor.
[01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:32.471]  Bang!
[01:00:33.331 --> 01:00:40.817]  So, Ron Paul is running down the House corridors, the Capitol corridors right now to get there.
[01:00:40.817 --> 01:00:46.301]  You know, that happens a lot with Congressmen when they're in session, is that it happens about half the time.
[01:00:46.301 --> 01:00:49.083]  They say they'll be on in the third hour, they're on in the first.
[01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:51.025]  Or they say they're on in the first hour, they're on in the fourth.
[01:00:51.025 --> 01:00:57.369]  But Ron Paul always comes through, and so next week I'll be able to ask my big row of important questions.
[01:00:57.369 --> 01:01:01.733]  But I think that little ten-minute pop-in from the Congressman, I wanted to ask him about
[01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:03.247]  Rand Paul's.
[01:01:05.448 --> 01:01:07.509]  A campaign coming up with the Senate.
[01:01:07.509 --> 01:01:10.932]  I wanted to talk to him about cap and trade and a lot more, but hey, it's better.
[01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:13.873]  Instead of our monthly visit, we'll have him next week.
[01:01:13.873 --> 01:01:15.574]  30 Minutes with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:01:15.574 --> 01:01:17.055]  I'm all over the map, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:17.055 --> 01:01:19.597]  I have stacks of off-the-charts important news.
[01:01:19.597 --> 01:01:24.860]  They're going to tax your food, your meat, not just in the name of carbon, but government cards.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.061]  Everyone's getting one.
[01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:27.902]  Tracking what you buy, sell, and do.
[01:01:27.902 --> 01:01:31.464]  This is going to be hellish bureaucrats in our lives.
[01:01:31.464 --> 01:01:32.945]  It's in all the official documents.
[01:01:32.945 --> 01:01:33.846]  Now they're proposing it.
[01:01:35.273 --> 01:01:40.034]  All these years we've talked about this and it's now happening, so that's coming up.
[01:01:40.034 --> 01:01:42.234]  Just tons of important news today.
[01:01:42.234 --> 01:01:48.616]  It actually makes me just head spin almost, but I want to go to calls now at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:48.616 --> 01:01:54.637]  I'm going to take calls in the next 30 minutes, then I'm going to hit news, go back to calls.
[01:01:54.637 --> 01:01:56.157]  It's open phones for the rest of the show today.
[01:01:56.157 --> 01:01:56.877]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:56.877 --> 01:01:57.097]  And I've
[01:02:04.394 --> 01:02:05.934]  Well, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:06.915]  Rod in Florida.
[01:02:06.915 --> 01:02:08.935]  You're on the air, Rod.
[01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:09.816]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:02:09.816 --> 01:02:12.436]  It's really nice to talk with you.
[01:02:12.436 --> 01:02:12.956]  Okay, bro.
[01:02:12.956 --> 01:02:13.617]  Good to talk to you.
[01:02:13.617 --> 01:02:14.757]  What's on your mind?
[01:02:14.757 --> 01:02:18.078]  Well, I have a question for Dr. Paul, but I guess he had to go back to work.
[01:02:18.078 --> 01:02:25.500]  So one of the things that I've been listening to you over the years, and I had a long conversation with Ron Paul back in 99 about a lot of this stuff.
[01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:44.015]  I'm an ex-federal investigator with the FAA and you know the 9-11 truth and all this other sort of things that are going on but one of the things that I've been listening to you over the years is One we have all these problems that are brought to our attention you've brought so much before us and I
[01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:49.013]  The one thing that I'm not hearing in the truth movement are solutions.
[01:02:49.013 --> 01:02:59.300]  I'm hearing lots and lots of problems, but real, true, honest-to-God solutions, such as, you know, is it going to be possible to dismantle the Federal Reserve, and what do we replace it with?
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:12.389]  You know, I'm going to be honest with you, I'm going to be honest with you, because I get this email a lot, and I get this call a lot, Rod, and I don't know what radio show you're listening to, and I don't know what liberty or freedom or truth movement.
[01:03:13.433 --> 01:03:18.615]  Or resistance, you know, pro-human movement, anti-eugenics movement, whatever you want to call free humanity.
[01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.215]  The free humanity movement.
[01:03:20.215 --> 01:03:21.916]  The decency, the love movement.
[01:03:21.916 --> 01:03:23.096]  I mean, whatever.
[01:03:23.096 --> 01:03:25.157]  The soul movement.
[01:03:25.157 --> 01:03:26.637]  The honor movement.
[01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:27.937]  The innocence movement.
[01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.498]  I don't know what show you're listening to.
[01:03:30.498 --> 01:03:35.800]  We're trying to audit the Fed to expose their crimes and then abolish them and get sound money under the U.S.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.480]  Constitution.
[01:03:37.642 --> 01:03:38.862]  I mean, giant solution.
[01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:49.945]  We're having the states, 30 plus of them, what, like 8 or 9 have now, or is it past that now, have passed the resolutions saying we're not going to follow federal takeovers, we're not going to follow gun confiscation.
[01:03:49.945 --> 01:03:54.386]  Tennessee, Wyoming, Utah, Louisiana passing pro-Second Amendment laws.
[01:03:54.386 --> 01:03:56.627]  The Fed's now saying we're going to ignore that.
[01:03:56.627 --> 01:03:57.267]  Court battles.
[01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:12.103]  uh... just endless solutions about run for county commissioner run for mayor run for uh... school board get involved in government stop focusing only on the big national international take the local occupy you know the ground
[01:04:13.484 --> 01:04:23.631]  Wake up neighbors, inform others, call in to talk radio, make films, start websites, educate yourselves, love your wife, love your husband, get right with God.
[01:04:23.631 --> 01:04:24.692]  It's an inside job.
[01:04:24.692 --> 01:04:26.593]  It starts with us.
[01:04:26.593 --> 01:04:28.074]  Be involved in the community.
[01:04:28.074 --> 01:04:38.180]  I mean, all I do, fight the CPS, pass legislation to restrict their criminal activities, support good police, punish bad ones.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:38.561]  Stay there.
[01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:42.225]  Rod, because, I mean, I'm going to give you a chance to give us solutions, Bubba.
[01:04:42.225 --> 01:04:47.892]  But, I mean, this is a... I'm not saying you're doing this, but go and tell pro parents that we don't give solutions.
[01:04:47.892 --> 01:04:54.960]  All we do is give solutions and give people spirit to know we can kick the butt of the new world order.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.321]  Okay?
[01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:57.484]  So, I don't know what show you're listening to.
[01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:05.756]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.756 --> 01:05:10.281]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:12.564]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.564 --> 01:05:14.186]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:15.207]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.447 --> 01:05:23.873]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:00.728 --> 01:06:05.691]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:30.828 --> 01:06:31.348]  We're good.
[01:07:01.516 --> 01:07:04.519]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:04.519 --> 01:07:09.865]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.865 --> 01:07:11.908]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.908 --> 01:07:16.493]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.573 --> 01:07:16.993]  I don't know.
[01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:35.067]  Have a good day.
[01:08:01.758 --> 01:08:04.539]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:07.380]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.172 --> 01:08:26.793]  I keep getting hundreds and hundreds of emails and web calls saying, who am I talking to?
[01:08:26.793 --> 01:08:34.695]  Sometimes I come in at the start of the show or start of a segment and I'm talking to John in Minnesota or I'm talking to my crew in there.
[01:08:34.695 --> 01:08:41.197]  I have an intercom to Minnesota and an intercom out into the control room in there and so
[01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:47.271]  I want to check and see if a caller is still there, because I see something going on with the phone lines.
[01:08:47.271 --> 01:09:06.477]  I'll go, oh, hey, and I'll hit the talkback button, and then you can't hear me, and I'll ask him, is the caller still there, or is that guest there, or something like that, because people keep making a much ado about nothing, about what's he doing, what's lip read.
[01:09:06.477 --> 01:09:10.898]  I was asking if Rod was still there from Florida, but see, when I hit talkback, he can't hear me.
[01:09:15.148 --> 01:09:17.650]  But my crew can hear me.
[01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:22.434]  So, that's what you're seeing at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the viewers out there.
[01:09:22.434 --> 01:09:30.421]  Okay, I want to continue with your calls now, and we're going to go back to Rod, but I want to answer his question.
[01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:33.183]  He says, I want to see more solutions.
[01:09:33.183 --> 01:09:34.884]  I want to hear more solutions.
[01:09:34.884 --> 01:09:36.506]  There's something very elementary here.
[01:09:37.802 --> 01:09:41.306]  Not just that we constantly ad nauseam talk about solutions.
[01:09:41.306 --> 01:09:49.016]  I mean, if people don't hear the solutions, they got wax filling their ears or something, or corks in their ears, headphones on.
[01:09:49.016 --> 01:09:49.636]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:09:50.592 --> 01:10:14.728]  But it's like blaring hip-hop music with the whole building shaking and somebody says, I don't hear any music and the windows are... It's like living downtown in 6th Street over a bar at night and you can't even... These people move downtown and they move in over bars and then they complain about the bars.
[01:10:14.728 --> 01:10:17.630]  It's like, I moved over a bar in the bar district.
[01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:18.711]  I don't know why I'm hearing this but
[01:10:20.285 --> 01:10:21.505]  He's asking about solutions.
[01:10:21.505 --> 01:10:27.167]  And so I'm going to give him a chance to give us the solutions because so often people that say give us solutions, they don't have solutions.
[01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:30.488]  But I bet Rod, a nice guy in Florida, I bet he does.
[01:10:30.488 --> 01:10:34.790]  I will tell you what we don't give you is easy cookie cutter ones.
[01:10:35.638 --> 01:10:53.492]  Instant gratification, drive through the Wendy's, drive through the Burger King, drive through the Sonic, drive through the McDonald's and get the food in one minute and you see the men and women sitting there stamping their feet and getting mad because there's five cars in front of them and they gotta wait two minutes at McDonald's to get some GMO.
[01:10:53.492 --> 01:11:05.121]  All we talk about is solutions and the biggest one is exposing the globalists and how they operate and how they work and how they've got us all turned against each other and how they use race to divide us in the name of fighting racism.
[01:11:07.037 --> 01:11:15.628]  All their tricks on display, teaching people how the system works, showing people how to think for themselves.
[01:11:15.628 --> 01:11:22.598]  All of that is a side issue to the central one, with the Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution.
[01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.274]  The Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution.
[01:11:28.274 --> 01:11:32.819]  They create the crisis, then they hype it up and say, what is somebody going to do?
[01:11:32.819 --> 01:11:36.842]  There's a crisis, there's a problem, it's bad, what are we going to do?
[01:11:36.842 --> 01:11:40.105]  And then they have their people come out and say, the solution is this.
[01:11:40.105 --> 01:11:45.550]  Something the public would have never accepted before, but if they frame it like the public wants it.
[01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:46.571]  We want a solution!
[01:11:46.571 --> 01:11:49.234]  We want Congress to get something done when the founders wanted
[01:11:50.512 --> 01:11:57.218]  Separation of powers and said gridlock was good because if you don't have gridlock you're gonna get a tyranny 100% of the time.
[01:11:57.218 --> 01:12:05.105]  You want government off your back so they set up a system where it all be tied up and it was an incredible engine of liberty and freedom that it unleashed.
[01:12:07.674 --> 01:12:23.928]  So, you hear this about solutions, and these politicians will come in there and they'll give you, oh, it's so easy, I'm gonna get you a car and a job and no more problems if you just vote for me, and then six, eight months into the administration, it's hell on earth.
[01:12:23.928 --> 01:12:32.576]  I'm gonna keep you safe from Al-Qaeda, then you find out the whole Homeland Security System's for you and your family, and was designed from the beginning to suppress the American people and offshore corporate takeover.
[01:12:33.928 --> 01:12:38.751]  It's the straitjacket to make sure you can't resist and get control of your government, legitimately.
[01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:40.932]  And to call dissent terrorism.
[01:12:40.932 --> 01:12:44.694]  And Homeland Security documents saying if you want to audit the Fed, you're a terrorist.
[01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:48.236]  Well, I guess 51% say abolish the Fed outright.
[01:12:48.236 --> 01:12:52.279]  And what is it, over 70-plus percent think it needs to be investigated?
[01:12:53.729 --> 01:13:00.212]  Well, you got 20-some percent that are still mind-numb robots, and they're all the ones sucking their thumbs, calling us the kooks.
[01:13:00.212 --> 01:13:02.013]  Look at how far we've come!
[01:13:02.013 --> 01:13:13.778]  Look at the success that we've had!
[01:13:13.778 --> 01:13:19.841]  The American people are waking up in a big, big way.
[01:13:19.841 --> 01:13:22.062]  Every single day, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:24.887 --> 01:13:33.893]  And I am just so excited about what's going on and what's happening.
[01:13:33.893 --> 01:13:47.103]  And nine times out of ten, when I see people complaining, they're on the web, they're on YouTube, they're on the message boards, they're emailing me, they're calling, saying, meanly a lot of times, not like Rod, why don't you do more?
[01:13:47.103 --> 01:13:48.443]  Why don't you have more solutions?
[01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:50.982]  You're not doing it right.
[01:13:50.982 --> 01:13:54.144]  You're not, you know, effective enough.
[01:13:54.144 --> 01:13:55.446]  Believe me, I know.
[01:13:55.446 --> 01:13:57.687]  I'm not perfect, but I'm in a fight.
[01:13:57.687 --> 01:14:03.392]  I'm being assaulted by a technocratic, eugenicist, scientific dictatorship.
[01:14:03.392 --> 01:14:06.094]  I am resisting it with my humanity.
[01:14:06.094 --> 01:14:08.276]  In any fight, you're not going to be perfect.
[01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:15.965]  Not even the best prize fighter, not even the best ultimate fighting championship, not the best Greco-Roman wrestler.
[01:14:15.965 --> 01:14:20.126]  They're not perfect, ladies and gentlemen, and I don't claim to be some expert at this.
[01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:31.609]  I'm somebody taking action, and so we spend all our time talking about how we need to talk about more solutions and how we need to do things better instead of taking action and getting involved.
[01:14:31.609 --> 01:14:36.190]  And I see so many other people that spend all their time critiquing others instead of being leaders themselves.
[01:14:37.594 --> 01:15:00.112]  But when somebody tells me we're not talking about solutions, when we say the state's rights movement, when we talk about taking over our local counties and cities, when we talk about pushing to get voting integrity, when we talk about exposing false flag terror so governments lose that favorite problem reaction solution system, when we realize that they create crises and then offer their solutions that are never what they claim they're for but to get more control and vertically integrate the economy,
[01:15:01.923 --> 01:15:05.687]  This is a long, hard, societal, cultural process.
[01:15:05.687 --> 01:15:10.952]  We've become domesticated, poisoned, dumbed down, and turned into a bunch of scum.
[01:15:10.952 --> 01:15:12.053]  Myself included.
[01:15:12.053 --> 01:15:14.075]  We have to pull out of this.
[01:15:14.075 --> 01:15:15.836]  It is a struggle.
[01:15:15.836 --> 01:15:18.039]  It is not just boom, easy.
[01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:22.352]  People like, well, you know, I want to see a solution with the Federal Reserve.
[01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.093]  What do you think it is to audit it?
[01:15:24.093 --> 01:15:26.873]  People say, well, I want to hear what the solution is once we audit it.
[01:15:26.873 --> 01:15:29.394]  Ron Paul's introduced bills of how to replace it.
[01:15:29.394 --> 01:15:32.615]  He has a bill with a bunch of sponsors to abolish it and a plan.
[01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:40.138]  And there's a bunch of other great plans and different debates about a gold-backed or a government fiat-backed or a partially gold or silver-backed.
[01:15:41.641 --> 01:15:52.524]  Or different monetization systems, or a different comprehensive annual financial investment system for dividends like Alaska has, where citizens get paid off of tax money investment.
[01:15:52.524 --> 01:15:54.984]  That's how much wealth the globalists created for themselves.
[01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:56.385]  We could have been all paid.
[01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:01.086]  They don't want us to get that, so they took the money, bankrupted it by design once they put it in real assets.
[01:16:01.946 --> 01:16:04.607]  I mean, I just give solution after solution.
[01:16:04.607 --> 01:16:05.888]  Don't take the vaccines.
[01:16:05.888 --> 01:16:06.948]  That's a big solution.
[01:16:06.948 --> 01:16:08.609]  Warn your neighbors not to take them.
[01:16:08.609 --> 01:16:12.111]  Tell police and firemen and medical workers that are being ordered to take it.
[01:16:13.163 --> 01:16:14.064]  That there's no law.
[01:16:14.064 --> 01:16:15.404]  They don't have to.
[01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:19.347]  And in 2002, we said no to the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:21.648]  14 million first responders told to take it.
[01:16:21.648 --> 01:16:23.169]  4,000 took it.
[01:16:23.169 --> 01:16:24.129]  A bunch of them died.
[01:16:24.129 --> 01:16:25.810]  Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it.
[01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.912]  Head of Human Health and Services, they suspended the program.
[01:16:28.912 --> 01:16:30.253]  Huge victory.
[01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:31.734]  Absolute solution.
[01:16:31.734 --> 01:16:33.235]  Hardcore info.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:49.086]  I mean, you know, they had a bill where the CPS in Texas could take your children, no judge, no jury, not even a fake order, take your medical records, computerize them all, which they've already done under other guises, use it, no more anything.
[01:16:49.086 --> 01:16:50.327]  We beat the bill.
[01:16:50.327 --> 01:16:53.128]  Just hundreds of solutions, hundreds of fights.
[01:16:53.128 --> 01:16:55.569]  We beat the trans-Texas corridor three times.
[01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:58.731]  First they came out and announced they had it, and then said it was a great thing, and
[01:16:59.671 --> 01:17:00.933]  Then we said, we didn't want it.
[01:17:00.933 --> 01:17:02.975]  So they said, you're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[01:17:02.975 --> 01:17:06.320]  And we said, don't try that Jedi mind trick on us, that game.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.601]  Here you are setting it up.
[01:17:07.601 --> 01:17:08.883]  Then they said, okay, but it's good.
[01:17:08.883 --> 01:17:10.385]  Then they said they canceled it.
[01:17:10.385 --> 01:17:12.548]  Now they came back and said, oh, we're just renaming it.
[01:17:12.548 --> 01:17:14.510]  We just went and beat it again at the legislature.
[01:17:15.467 --> 01:17:36.484]  I mean, we're here swinging muskets at the Alamo, fighting for our lives, and there's a bunch of people going, you need to swing your musket a little bit better up there on the parapet, and you need to give me a little more... I mean, I could just go for... in fact, I could suspend all calls, all guests, everything, and just give you solutions for hundreds of hours and victories we've had and everything we've done.
[01:17:36.484 --> 01:17:41.848]  I'll tell you the solution, it's getting up off our big fat butts and taking action against the New World Order.
[01:17:43.194 --> 01:17:49.539]  It's getting basic instincts of defending your family, never ratting out your family, not trusting the government.
[01:17:49.539 --> 01:17:50.900]  That's a big fat solution.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:18:02.328]  Not complying, not going along, not giving in, becoming Americans again, becoming free people again, not being a bunch of trusting gullible jackasses.
[01:18:02.328 --> 01:18:06.731]  Now, Rod, I want you to give me solutions right now.
[01:18:06.731 --> 01:18:08.552]  You're talking to millions of people, buddy.
[01:18:08.552 --> 01:18:09.433]  You give me solutions.
[01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:17.898]  Well, one of the solutions that I had in mind that I really wanted to talk to Ron Paul about was, what do we do when the Federal Reserve... Hold on just a minute.
[01:18:17.898 --> 01:18:18.318]  Hold on.
[01:18:18.318 --> 01:18:19.339]  See how you did that again?
[01:18:19.339 --> 01:18:21.280]  The spirit of complaining.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.081]  We weren't going to take calls for Ron Paul.
[01:18:23.081 --> 01:18:25.283]  I said we were going to take calls after Ron Paul.
[01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:26.324]  You're on the air.
[01:18:26.324 --> 01:18:30.006]  I wasn't here to do... You can send Ron Paul.
[01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:34.569]  What is that little thing about... I mean, did we do something... It's kind of like we're not providing a service here.
[01:18:34.569 --> 01:18:36.111]  I mean, what's that statement there?
[01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.393]  That little, you know, I wanted to talk to Ron Paul.
[01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:43.550]  It was just, that's what the question was based for.
[01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:46.332]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:18:46.332 --> 01:18:51.494]  Don't get me wrong, I think that if it wasn't for you, we'd be back in the Stone Age.
[01:18:51.494 --> 01:19:00.978]  What I was talking about was very specific, because like for instance, with the situation that we're in right now, the United States, everybody is so dependent upon credit.
[01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:05.790]  And they're not going to do anything if they can't have their Mercedes and they can't have their Harley Davidson.
[01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:09.332]  That's why I said, Ron Paul, we are held hostage by these bankers.
[01:19:09.332 --> 01:19:11.534]  Exactly, that's my point, exactly.
[01:19:11.534 --> 01:19:18.417]  What I'm, as a listener, I'm not trying to say that you're not doing anything because, man, if it wasn't for you, we'd be in big trouble.
[01:19:18.417 --> 01:19:22.700]  No, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, Ron, it's you!
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:25.261]  You're the power taking action!
[01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.822]  Well, when I was in the federal government,
[01:19:27.597 --> 01:19:30.541]  I was an investigator and I was hired on 9-12.
[01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:31.161]  Okay?
[01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:33.604]  And I saw the bull that was going on there.
[01:19:33.604 --> 01:19:33.844]  Okay?
[01:19:33.844 --> 01:19:34.986]  I want to hear about it when we get back.
[01:19:34.986 --> 01:19:38.169]  I'm going to quit interrupting you and then I promise we're going to get to Scott, Phillip, Donna.
[01:19:38.169 --> 01:19:42.915]  Then we'll just take calls the rest of the hour because I got... One caller can call in with an issue.
[01:19:42.915 --> 01:19:44.116]  And I just go off on it.
[01:19:44.116 --> 01:19:44.817]  But it's important!
[01:19:45.538 --> 01:19:50.345]  But I want everybody to understand, this show is nothing but one big giant solution.
[01:19:50.345 --> 01:19:57.334]  It's called love and liberty and freedom and getting up on your hind legs and standing up to bullies and cleaning house.
[01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:58.756]  It's getting fired up!
[01:20:01.148 --> 01:20:04.271]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:08.714]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:20:08.714 --> 01:20:11.236]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:20:11.236 --> 01:20:17.500]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:23.825]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[01:20:25.066 --> 01:20:27.309]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[01:20:34.698 --> 01:20:36.861]  You know, you work hard for your money.

[01:21:02.509 --> 01:21:03.951]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:03.951 --> 01:21:10.018]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:10.018 --> 01:21:10.819]  That's right.
[01:21:10.819 --> 01:21:13.443]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:13.443 --> 01:21:20.611]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:21.152 --> 01:21:29.276]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:29.276 --> 01:21:34.759]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:34.759 --> 01:21:40.582]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.582 --> 01:21:45.084]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:45.084 --> 01:21:45.344]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:50.426]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:50.426 --> 01:21:52.907]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:54.467]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.467 --> 01:22:02.490]  It is a big idea.
[01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:05.311]  A new world order.
[01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:10.213]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:22:10.213 --> 01:22:13.034]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:13.034 --> 01:22:15.195]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:22:15.822 --> 01:22:18.985]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[01:22:18.985 --> 01:22:29.355]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:22:29.355 --> 01:22:30.656]  For the first time in history,
[01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:34.790]  The Elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:38.650]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:41.211]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:42.371]  Most people have no idea.
[01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:43.151]  They're not after money.
[01:22:43.151 --> 01:22:44.451]  They have all the money they need.
[01:22:44.451 --> 01:22:45.412]  They're after power.
[01:22:45.412 --> 01:22:46.572]  That's what they're after.

[01:22:58.094 --> 01:22:59.254]  You have been warned.
[01:23:00.772 --> 01:23:06.275]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:23:06.275 --> 01:23:07.056]  and the world.
[01:23:07.056 --> 01:23:10.918]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:23:10.918 --> 01:23:17.422]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:23:17.422 --> 01:23:19.463]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:23:19.463 --> 01:23:27.408]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:23:27.668 --> 01:23:32.375]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:38.203]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:23:38.203 --> 01:23:40.386]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:48.533]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:23:48.533 --> 01:23:48.993]  Watch me!
[01:23:48.993 --> 01:23:49.394]  Watch me!
[01:23:49.394 --> 01:23:49.794]  I got it!
[01:24:13.012 --> 01:24:16.274]  By the way, I'm gonna go ahead and have Carpney on in the last hour of the day.
[01:24:16.274 --> 01:24:20.516]  Talk about Obama's plunging approval ratings and what that means.
[01:24:20.516 --> 01:24:21.777]  The cap and trade and a lot more.
[01:24:21.777 --> 01:24:24.499]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Scott, Philip, Donna, David.
[01:24:24.499 --> 01:24:26.140]  You've been holding like champs.
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:30.422]  Rod, finish your points you've been trying to make about being a federal investigator after 9-12.
[01:24:30.422 --> 01:24:30.682]  Go ahead.
[01:24:32.455 --> 01:24:38.683]  Well, basically the question that I wanted to get to was, what do we replace the system with, specifically?
[01:24:38.683 --> 01:24:41.366]  Do we print a new dollar?
[01:24:41.366 --> 01:24:44.991]  What is that going to do to the countries around the world that are holding dollars?
[01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:49.677]  Is there a reasonable way, when the system is based on fraud, and fraud is a crime,
[01:24:50.137 --> 01:24:52.519]  Who is responsible to be arresting these people?
[01:24:52.519 --> 01:24:54.200]  Who is it specifically?
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.401]  That's what I'm asking about.
[01:24:55.401 --> 01:25:02.646]  I'm asking about who is actually specifically in charge to oversee these things so that we can hold these people accountable.
[01:25:02.646 --> 01:25:03.727]  I don't know where to go.
[01:25:03.727 --> 01:25:08.891]  Ron Paul says state grand juries should start indicting all these people like Madoff and others.
[01:25:10.123 --> 01:25:16.587]  Doing investigations, and then after that people can be federally charged if they've been convicted in state court.
[01:25:16.587 --> 01:25:24.873]  Clearly there are processes that Ron Paul and many other economists, he is an economist, not his medical doctor, have laid out.
[01:25:24.873 --> 01:25:29.876]  We can have a debate about that, but we know this group of crooks needs to go.
[01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:33.459]  Some plans over a decade would phase out the current dollar.
[01:25:34.807 --> 01:25:40.071]  The Federal Reserve Dollar and at the same time would stop issuing as much of it.
[01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:42.874]  So that would actually be good for nations holding it.
[01:25:42.874 --> 01:25:47.137]  And then you'd have kind of a dual system as you phased that out.
[01:25:47.137 --> 01:25:53.862]  You would ban the derivatives, these fraudulent counterfeit instruments they make.
[01:25:53.862 --> 01:25:56.204]  Banks just make these up.
[01:25:56.204 --> 01:26:03.030]  You would restrict fractional reserve banking because this is the false economy, the predatory economy, the flim-flam economy.
[01:26:04.065 --> 01:26:06.348]  That is waging war against the real economy.
[01:26:06.348 --> 01:26:08.872]  Notice the biggest funders of global greenhouse taxes and...
[01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:18.821]  These systems are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of England, shareholders, Goldman Sachs, because they're parasites.
[01:26:18.821 --> 01:26:19.842]  They want you bankrupt.
[01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:21.642]  They want to own you.
[01:26:21.642 --> 01:26:25.363]  They are con artists, Ponzi scheme operators.
[01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:27.444]  They got so big they rule the planet.
[01:26:27.444 --> 01:26:29.284]  But it's through fraud!
[01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:33.846]  And so we just point out that they are the real government instead of always looking at Obama or Bush.
[01:26:33.846 --> 01:26:34.866]  They're like, look at my puppets.
[01:26:36.226 --> 01:26:37.207]  I need to get some little puppets.
[01:26:37.207 --> 01:26:38.628]  An Obama puppet.
[01:26:38.628 --> 01:26:39.709]  Have somebody make one.
[01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:41.730]  An Obama puppet and a Bush puppet.
[01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:42.430]  Or a McCain puppet.
[01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.271]  Look, here's my puppets.
[01:26:43.271 --> 01:26:44.351]  Don't look at me.
[01:26:44.351 --> 01:26:46.893]  Meanwhile, here's the New World Order up here.
[01:26:46.893 --> 01:26:48.774]  We're starting to look past them.
[01:26:48.774 --> 01:26:51.196]  People are finding out, oh, it's the banks.
[01:26:51.196 --> 01:26:52.657]  Oh, it's the New World Order.
[01:26:52.657 --> 01:26:53.677]  And they are getting scared.
[01:26:53.677 --> 01:26:57.479]  I watched Bernanke in this town hall at the Kansas City Fed.
[01:26:57.479 --> 01:27:01.762]  Same Fed where they tried to arrest my guys for being 200 yards away at a World War I memorial.
[01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:04.847]  Crazy video on the web.
[01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:06.847]  That's in the new film, by the way.
[01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.788]  And our clip of it is.
[01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:11.069]  And Bernanke's scared up there.
[01:27:11.069 --> 01:27:12.530]  Look, they've lost the arrogance.
[01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:16.772]  They used to go into Congress and Congress was like, my God, a God just came in.
[01:27:16.772 --> 01:27:18.853]  And now it's, hey, crook, what are you doing?
[01:27:18.853 --> 01:27:19.994]  It's over for them.
[01:27:19.994 --> 01:27:22.735]  They can and they're going to they're going to pull scams.
[01:27:22.735 --> 01:27:25.216]  But I mean, you ask, what do we replace it with?
[01:27:25.216 --> 01:27:25.996]  The Constitution.
[01:27:25.996 --> 01:27:27.297]  It has provisions for all of that.
[01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:38.370]  I see that and but one of the things that as a listener and that's really all I'm trying to say here is as a listener
[01:27:38.948 --> 01:27:42.090]  I'm trying to get up my own ideas as to what I can go and do.
[01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.212]  And I get those from you, I get them from a lot of other people.
[01:27:45.212 --> 01:27:48.834]  And I've already exercised my abilities.
[01:27:48.834 --> 01:27:50.235]  I've contacted my congressmen.
[01:27:50.235 --> 01:27:52.116]  I've contacted my representatives.
[01:27:52.116 --> 01:27:55.118]  I was the Alaska State Coordinator for We the People of Bob Schultz.
[01:27:55.118 --> 01:27:58.761]  That's how I initially got in touch with Ron Paul back in 99.
[01:27:58.761 --> 01:28:00.061]  I was a federal investigator.
[01:28:00.061 --> 01:28:02.263]  I resigned due to corruptions and some other things.
[01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:09.868]  Uh, you know, I've done everything that I can do as a person that I think of to do this, but yet it's still going on.
[01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:11.969]  So I see your fight.
[01:28:11.969 --> 01:28:14.031]  I'm trying to participate in the fight.
[01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:21.396]  And what I think we ought to do is really look into the possibility of citizens arrest because under the constitution, it's
[01:28:21.576 --> 01:28:29.642]  Yeah, no, that is in the Constitution, and the people created the counties and cities and states, and so that's why a city is a corporation.
[01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:31.784]  It's so-called self-rule.
[01:28:31.784 --> 01:28:35.707]  Now the mayors and police forces are owned by the unions and the offshore banks.
[01:28:35.707 --> 01:28:38.409]  Most of them don't even know it, and so it's an us against them.
[01:28:38.409 --> 01:28:40.571]  They're sucking off us.
[01:28:40.571 --> 01:28:41.351]  It's the parasite.
[01:28:41.351 --> 01:28:45.855]  It's like the thing in the movie Alien that attaches to your face and lays the New World Order egg.
[01:28:45.855 --> 01:28:47.216]  We gotta get it off our face.
[01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:57.145]  And so, instead of always trying to find a magic bullet or something that brings the whole elephant down, you've got to just go in, discredit the system, until nobody supports it.
[01:28:57.145 --> 01:28:58.847]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:58.847 --> 01:28:59.688]  Scott in Texas.
[01:28:59.688 --> 01:29:01.810]  Go ahead, Scott.
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:03.051]  How's it going?
[01:29:03.051 --> 01:29:06.595]  Worldwide transmission.
[01:29:06.595 --> 01:29:10.278]  I hear your thing about solutions, and I'm a first-time caller.
[01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:11.740]  I've only been listening to you recently, but I've
[01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:17.281]  Covered a ton of your stuff on the internet, over 50 hours of YouTube, including the Obama deception.
[01:29:17.281 --> 01:29:22.965]  And my question, and I'm with you on everything from New World Order to the Bilderbergers, Trilateral Commission, Council of Foreign Affairs, all that stuff.
[01:29:22.965 --> 01:29:26.387]  Because it's happening right under our noses and the evidence is right there.
[01:29:26.387 --> 01:29:32.090]  But my question is, we talk about fighting the New World Order and exposing the secret government and spreading the word and all this.
[01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:39.515]  I never hear anybody talking about the reasons why these elite factions feel it necessary to congregate in these organizations and secretly plan all of our futures.
[01:29:40.046 --> 01:29:40.747]  Alright, stay there.
[01:29:40.747 --> 01:29:41.727]  You're making a great point.
[01:29:41.727 --> 01:29:45.970]  We're going to come back and talk about that with Scott, Phillip, Donna, David, and a lot of others.
[01:29:45.970 --> 01:29:51.374]  Right here on GCN, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:51.374 --> 01:29:52.755]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.755 --> 01:29:55.297]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.297 --> 01:29:57.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:01.734]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.734 --> 01:30:03.716]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:30:03.716 --> 01:30:04.357]  Well, you should.
[01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:09.202]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:30:09.202 --> 01:30:10.003]  That's right.
[01:30:10.003 --> 01:30:18.671]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:30:18.671 --> 01:30:20.033]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:20.033 --> 01:30:21.174]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:27.358]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:30:27.358 --> 01:30:34.243]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:30:34.243 --> 01:30:39.427]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.228]  This is real.
[01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:42.269]  Don't miss out.
[01:30:42.269 --> 01:30:50.834]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[01:30:50.834 --> 01:30:53.215]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:56.897]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:30:56.897 --> 01:30:59.819]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.342]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.342 --> 01:31:05.306]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[01:31:05.306 --> 01:31:07.088]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[01:31:07.088 --> 01:31:08.269]  We need to be independent.
[01:31:08.269 --> 01:31:10.051]  And food and water is the key.
[01:31:10.051 --> 01:31:13.095]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:31:13.095 --> 01:31:17.821]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:31:18.041 --> 01:31:19.162]  If you simply prepare.
[01:31:19.162 --> 01:31:22.403]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:31:22.403 --> 01:31:29.407]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:31:29.407 --> 01:31:32.669]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.929]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[01:31:49.214 --> 01:31:49.834]  Take action today.
[01:31:49.834 --> 01:31:51.655]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:32:01.317 --> 01:32:03.819]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:32:03.819 --> 01:32:06.161]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:08.183]  The price of food continues to rise.
[01:32:10.865 --> 01:32:12.705]  I know that you need to prepare.
[01:32:12.705 --> 01:32:16.486]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:32:16.486 --> 01:32:20.087]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[01:32:49.736 --> 01:32:52.377]  So head over to OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:32:52.377 --> 01:32:57.820]  That's O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A Seed.com.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.381]  OrganicaSeed.com today!
[01:33:05.083 --> 01:33:10.465]  What I'm going to do is massive news blitz starting at 8 after in the second segment of the next hour.
[01:33:10.465 --> 01:33:13.006]  Then continuing with Open Phones.
[01:33:13.006 --> 01:33:16.168]  Webster Tarbley popping in for about 45 minutes in the last hour.
[01:33:16.168 --> 01:33:23.411]  I was going to have nothing but calls today, but then Ron Paul was on and then Tarbley's just been right about too much stuff.
[01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:24.631]  Right on target.
[01:33:24.631 --> 01:33:27.933]  My respect for him grows every day.
[01:33:27.933 --> 01:33:30.534]  So that is coming up.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:35.843]  Later in the transmission today.
[01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:40.747]  I did even skip a break last hour for Ron Paul because he had to change when he was coming on.
[01:33:40.747 --> 01:33:46.272]  I'm going to go back to Scott and Phillip and Donna and David and Randy and others here in just a moment.
[01:33:46.272 --> 01:33:53.118]  But before I do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's transmission possible.
[01:33:53.118 --> 01:33:55.139]  Guys, will you give me that stack of DVDs over there?
[01:33:55.139 --> 01:33:57.962]  Because I can't get up and get them.
[01:33:57.962 --> 01:34:00.624]  The number one sponsor is MyFilms.
[01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:09.276]  The number one sponsor is my documentaries.
[01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:12.158]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:34:12.158 --> 01:34:13.279]  That and our advertisers.
[01:34:13.279 --> 01:34:17.783]  Plus, these really are the premier anti-New World Order, pro-Liberty films out there.
[01:34:17.783 --> 01:34:22.747]  I mean, Endgame is more important than the Obama deception overall.
[01:34:22.747 --> 01:34:30.814]  This shows you who the globalists are, what their master plan is, that they're eugenicists, the admitted murder of troops and foster children and black people.
[01:34:32.048 --> 01:34:34.269]  Native Americans and everybody else.
[01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:36.670]  I mean, this film is what's on record.
[01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:40.572]  I mean, these people will take a two-year-old, strap him down, and radiate him to death.
[01:34:40.572 --> 01:34:43.393]  They'll take a foster kid and give him drugs till they die.
[01:34:43.393 --> 01:34:44.593]  No one is going to kill him.
[01:34:44.593 --> 01:34:46.814]  I mean, you want to know who we're fighting, folks?
[01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.355]  These are real monsters.
[01:34:48.355 --> 01:34:49.315]  And Endgame covers it.
[01:34:49.315 --> 01:34:50.236]  Get it.
[01:34:50.236 --> 01:34:51.136]  Make copies of it.
[01:34:51.136 --> 01:34:51.936]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:55.038]  This film needs to be megaviral.
[01:34:55.038 --> 01:34:57.899]  Generation Rx, about how they're drugging our kids.
[01:34:57.899 --> 01:34:59.920]  By design, very important film we carry.
[01:35:00.765 --> 01:35:05.846]  Fabled Enemies, the latest and best 9-11 truth film out there, with the latest info by Jason Bermas.
[01:35:05.846 --> 01:35:07.947]  Hardcore Fabled Enemies.
[01:35:07.947 --> 01:35:13.308]  Anthrax War, new film we're carrying, excellent getting into all that threat and the government operations and history of it.
[01:35:13.308 --> 01:35:14.469]  Very well produced.
[01:35:14.469 --> 01:35:19.670]  Global Warming, Emerging Science and Understanding, Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:22.111]  Very well done, even better than his last one.
[01:35:22.111 --> 01:35:23.971]  Breaking Down the Fraud of Global Warming.
[01:35:23.971 --> 01:35:26.092]  You may know all about this.
[01:35:26.092 --> 01:35:27.612]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors don't.
[01:35:28.882 --> 01:35:32.970]  And they're using global warming to micromanage and set up the eugenics economy.
[01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:37.258]  The micromanaging carbon tax, carbon footprint system.
[01:35:37.258 --> 01:35:38.180]  You need to see this film.
[01:35:39.738 --> 01:35:45.001]  This film's free when you get it with the Obama deception or some of my other documentaries.
[01:35:45.001 --> 01:35:46.162]  Free.
[01:35:46.162 --> 01:35:51.225]  And it's the entire interview with Aaron Russo before he died, the last video interview out there.
[01:35:51.225 --> 01:35:51.705]  Great guy.
[01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:53.166]  People kept asking for it on DVD.
[01:35:53.166 --> 01:35:58.950]  Here it is with an update by myself on the banking takeover, the New World Order, and a lot of his predictions coming true.
[01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:01.311]  It's Reflections and Warnings.
[01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:03.912]  It's about 100 minutes long on DVD.
[01:36:03.912 --> 01:36:05.172]  You can get it free.
[01:36:05.172 --> 01:36:13.036]  Check out the offers at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:13.036 --> 01:36:19.579]  Films like Martial Law, the classic, three hours long with 45 minutes of extras.
[01:36:19.579 --> 01:36:21.500]  This is an incredible film.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:25.541]  The Police State, The New World Order, their philosophy, Bohemian Grove, all of it.
[01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:26.862]  This is like three films in one.
[01:36:28.732 --> 01:36:30.115]  The biggest film I ever made.
[01:36:30.115 --> 01:36:34.266]  This film has probably been seen by more people and more DVDs sold than all these combined.
[01:36:35.257 --> 01:36:40.238]  And it's good because it shatters the left-right paradigm and how both parties are controlled.
[01:36:40.238 --> 01:36:41.958]  It's elementary.
[01:36:41.958 --> 01:36:46.539]  It's got a lot of insight in the latest developments in his real agenda versus his fake one.
[01:36:46.539 --> 01:36:49.020]  But it's very popular because it's elementary.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.280]  It's designed for those that don't understand this.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.721]  And it's breaking everybody's conditioning.
[01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:55.101]  This film is devastating.
[01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:56.642]  This is the film to show a beginner.
[01:36:56.642 --> 01:36:58.122]  The Obama Deception, own it on DVD.
[01:36:59.571 --> 01:37:02.013]  And a lot of other books and videos we carry, okay?
[01:37:02.013 --> 01:37:02.774]  So, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:02.774 --> 01:37:02.834]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:02.834 --> 01:37:03.995]  You can also write to me.
[01:37:03.995 --> 01:37:07.017]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:37:07.017 --> 01:37:08.879]  And I don't really use that Dropbox anymore.
[01:37:08.879 --> 01:37:10.360]  I'm supposed to stop using that.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.361]  What's the P.O.
[01:37:11.361 --> 01:37:11.501]  Box?
[01:37:11.501 --> 01:37:13.303]  Make me start using the P.O.
[01:37:13.303 --> 01:37:13.363]  Box.
[01:37:26.892 --> 01:37:28.033]  Because I am just bad.
[01:37:28.033 --> 01:37:32.116]  I keep using that address and they tell me I can't use it in a couple months.
[01:37:32.116 --> 01:37:34.738]  Well, go ahead and tell folks on air, Hoosh.
[01:37:34.738 --> 01:37:36.840]  Pop it on air right now.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.200]  It'll be 19-549.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.602]  Austin, Texas.
[01:37:38.602 --> 01:37:42.825]  I'm sorry, let me do it all for you.
[01:37:42.825 --> 01:37:42.885]  19-549.
[01:37:42.885 --> 01:37:43.566]  That's the P.O.
[01:37:43.566 --> 01:37:43.686]  Box.
[01:37:43.686 --> 01:37:44.086]  Austin, Texas.
[01:37:44.086 --> 01:37:44.126]  787-60.
[01:37:44.126 --> 01:37:44.927]  Good job, my man.
[01:37:44.927 --> 01:37:45.127]  Thank you.
[01:37:55.509 --> 01:37:58.171]  Now give it out to them again, because they're going to call and say they didn't hear it.
[01:37:58.171 --> 01:38:00.412]  I mean, I couldn't even have written that down that fast.
[01:38:00.412 --> 01:38:04.234]  It's Free Speech Systems, LLC, P.O.
[01:38:04.234 --> 01:38:11.138]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:38:11.138 --> 01:38:17.322]  That's right, and you can address stuff, Alex Jones, InfoWars, Free Speech Systems, whatever you like, it all works.
[01:38:17.322 --> 01:38:18.583]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:38:18.583 --> 01:38:24.246]  And then one last sponsor, I didn't plug any of this last hour, we're catching up, and we're going back to your calls, AkolaBlue.com!

[01:38:28.294 --> 01:38:31.895]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[01:38:31.895 --> 01:38:33.976]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.

[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.000]  Give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:11.060]  800-691-6043.
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:11.140]  Okay!
[01:39:16.397 --> 01:39:19.938]  I'm done with that five minute rant plug fest.
[01:39:19.938 --> 01:39:22.519]  Let's just try to get to your calls here.
[01:39:22.519 --> 01:39:24.780]  Scott, recap the point you were making.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:27.500]  It sounded really interesting and then finish up.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:31.422]  Yeah, well basically what I was getting at is finding out the why behind all these.
[01:39:31.422 --> 01:39:34.863]  Everything that you're following, all those groups, absolutely it's happening.
[01:39:34.863 --> 01:39:35.543]  It's undeniable.
[01:39:35.543 --> 01:39:36.223]  It's indisputable.
[01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:38.262]  But I was trying to get as to the why.
[01:39:38.262 --> 01:39:47.809]  I mean, let's face it, most of us growing up, especially these days, are brought up to distrust politicians and world leaders because they seem to only have the interest of a very few elite at heart.
[01:39:47.809 --> 01:39:51.091]  But, I mean, did it ever occur to anyone that the bulk of the U.S.
[01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:58.476]  population, and heck, the world population for that matter, does not have the mental capacity to deal with some of the difficult decisions that need to be made on a very grand scale?
[01:39:58.476 --> 01:40:03.219]  What do you think of that?
[01:40:03.219 --> 01:40:04.200]  What are you getting at there?
[01:40:06.968 --> 01:40:13.753]  What I'm getting at is, I don't necessarily agree with... I agree with everything that you're saying.
[01:40:13.753 --> 01:40:16.515]  Everything is happening the way you say it's happening.
[01:40:16.515 --> 01:40:21.399]  My question is, playing devil's advocate here, is are we sure that this isn't a good thing?
[01:40:21.399 --> 01:40:22.880]  Are we not preparing for something bigger?
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.223]  Do we know why they feel it necessary to try to govern our lives as they do?
[01:40:26.223 --> 01:40:32.288]  Maybe it's good to take the third world children and deal with them for their own good?
[01:40:32.288 --> 01:40:32.388]  Right?
[01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:38.962]  Give them a Colombian necktie?
[01:40:38.962 --> 01:40:40.043]  No, no, no, no.
[01:40:40.043 --> 01:40:41.203]  I'm not going that direction.
[01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:49.487]  I know it's for the earth because maybe the elites are the elites because they know something we don't and maybe it's sad, but they're willing to do the tough things.
[01:40:49.487 --> 01:40:51.168]  That's their attitude.
[01:40:51.168 --> 01:40:56.111]  So sorry about having to kill all these people, but somebody's got to do it.
[01:40:56.111 --> 01:41:02.233]  And even think about their RFID chip, which is... Come to me, my child!
[01:41:02.233 --> 01:41:05.275]  Well, that's an excellent way for them to track everyone's worth.
[01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:11.667]  I mean, I've seen the interviews with Aaron Russo and everything you guys did there.
[01:41:11.667 --> 01:41:22.817]  Although they talk about it as they play it off as a means to secure currency transactions, to secure your ID, all that kind of stuff, there's so many other functions they can use it for.
[01:41:23.621 --> 01:41:27.503]  Basically, your overall worth is tracked, and just like they said, if they don't like what you're doing, they shut it off.
[01:41:27.503 --> 01:41:42.709]  But, when it's on, they know where your relative spot in humanity is based on your value, on your... And we have these little carbon blobs, these third-world people that are hurting the Earth because the carbon dioxide is deadly poison, they exhale?
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:45.861]  I mean, everything the globalists say is a lie.
[01:41:45.861 --> 01:41:47.401]  They're control freaks.
[01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:49.882]  And they claim they don't want nukes spreading, but they hand them out.
[01:41:49.882 --> 01:41:52.742]  They claim that genetic engineering across species is dangerous.
[01:41:52.742 --> 01:41:54.083]  They're the ones doing it.
[01:41:54.083 --> 01:41:56.103]  You know, they're the ones engaging in all the experiments.
[01:41:56.103 --> 01:41:57.844]  They're the ones dumping toxic waste.
[01:41:57.844 --> 01:42:00.905]  They're the ones throwing nuke reactors in the Black Sea.
[01:42:02.458 --> 01:42:10.661]  They consistently are doing all this bad stuff and then always calling for more power out of the crises they've created.
[01:42:10.661 --> 01:42:19.425]  And you can argue that some areas of the earth could be overpopulated, some of these megacities, and that some of the technologies are dirty, but they're suppressing the clean technologies.
[01:42:19.425 --> 01:42:24.827]  And then they say, oh, well, we're euthanizing and sterilizing and poisoning the third world to cull their numbers.
[01:42:24.827 --> 01:42:31.490]  But when you find out, they actually said in the Royal Commission in 49, we're going to let their numbers explode to tie them down.
[01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:36.332]  And then we'll call him off later as part of another operation.
[01:42:36.332 --> 01:42:40.754]  So it's very, very sick.
[01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:43.716]  And not everyone is admitting there's a Bilderberg Group.
[01:42:43.716 --> 01:42:48.558]  I've got Chris Matthews basically following White House talking points saying we're all insane.
[01:42:48.558 --> 01:42:49.799]  I'm going to play a clip of it later.
[01:42:49.799 --> 01:42:51.140]  I meant to yesterday.
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:52.781]  We're all insane and crazy.
[01:42:52.781 --> 01:42:56.262]  And if we believe in Bilderberg Group, we're nuts.
[01:42:59.192 --> 01:43:14.023]  They gotta go out from the Politico saying this when Politico's done reports admitting it's real and they're calling for a world government and then meanwhile there's hundreds and hundreds of news articles a month calling for a world government to save us from the devilish carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[01:43:14.861 --> 01:43:19.825]  That is, you know, just so deadly, it's scarier than a body snatcher.
[01:43:19.825 --> 01:43:22.286]  The globalists are control freaks.
[01:43:22.286 --> 01:43:27.330]  Hitler was killing all those people, saying there wasn't living space, and that they had to make livings.
[01:43:27.330 --> 01:43:28.491]  He was an environmentalist.
[01:43:28.491 --> 01:43:30.252]  He was a vegetarian.
[01:43:30.252 --> 01:43:37.177]  And I'm not saying all environmentalists or vegetarians are bad, but I'm saying the environmental movement was founded by the Rockefellers, on record.
[01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:41.720]  And they set it up to teach us that humans were bad, so they could have all the land and property.
[01:43:42.981 --> 01:44:04.352]  You understand it's neo-feudalism and serfdom that when England had maybe 500,000 people in it 800, 900 years ago in all of southern England, which was the main kingdom, that they were saying it was overpopulated then and people were kept on tiny pieces of land at starvation level as a tool of control?
[01:44:04.352 --> 01:44:08.775]  I mean, do you want to be the one to go, maybe there are too many people?
[01:44:09.634 --> 01:44:12.760]  Go ahead and inject that child with the HIV.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:19.574]  I mean, that's no different than taking a dagger and just plunging it into somebody's heart.
[01:44:19.574 --> 01:44:20.155]  Anything else, Scott?
[01:44:22.895 --> 01:44:23.555]  Pardon me?
[01:44:23.555 --> 01:44:24.856]  Is that what everything is about?
[01:44:24.856 --> 01:44:27.178]  I mean, does it all boil down to population control?
[01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:28.639]  Have you read?
[01:44:28.639 --> 01:44:31.221]  I've now read most of the 1,100-page book.
[01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:40.707]  In the last four weeks since we pushed it out and really broke it nationally, the eco-science textbook written by the White House science czar is the complete plan.
[01:44:41.909 --> 01:44:51.675]  Weather modification to kill the crops you can't eat, forced sterilization, CPS taking all children at birth, giant communal living centers that the kids are brought up in.
[01:44:51.675 --> 01:44:52.876]  That's what China does.
[01:44:52.876 --> 01:44:57.999]  They signed a deal with the globalists to be made the global superpower if they do this.
[01:44:59.673 --> 01:45:01.054]  They mean business, pal.
[01:45:01.054 --> 01:45:02.715]  Yes, that's what it's about.
[01:45:02.715 --> 01:45:04.056]  And look, I want to tell the yuppies this.
[01:45:04.056 --> 01:45:05.977]  A lot of them think they're part of the elite.
[01:45:05.977 --> 01:45:12.202]  You're not getting exempt from the chemtrail, from the sodium fluoride, from the mercury, from the agitants, from all of this.
[01:45:12.202 --> 01:45:13.383]  You're getting hit, too.
[01:45:13.383 --> 01:45:18.706]  So, you may want to slaughter these people at some greedy, primitive level, some tribal level.
[01:45:18.706 --> 01:45:23.010]  You don't understand the pie is limitless and we can always expand it.
[01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:24.751]  And that we're meant to push off to the stars.
[01:45:26.676 --> 01:45:35.103]  A life-creating, terraforming species, which is going to be awesome if we can just get past these control freaks and these malfunctioning cancers.
[01:45:35.103 --> 01:45:36.785]  I mean, that's what these elite humans are.
[01:45:36.785 --> 01:45:40.068]  The elite call themselves elite, special species.
[01:45:40.068 --> 01:45:43.651]  In fact, Google, elite will split into separate species, guys.
[01:45:43.651 --> 01:45:47.554]  BBC, with them bragging how they're already a super species.
[01:45:47.554 --> 01:45:49.976]  Yeah, they're a super degenerate species.
[01:45:50.657 --> 01:45:53.138]  I mean, it's like a bed bug or fleas or something.
[01:45:53.138 --> 01:45:54.498]  I mean, there's nothing special.
[01:45:54.498 --> 01:45:58.119]  They don't have the true vision and love of life.
[01:45:58.119 --> 01:45:59.179]  And that's disgusting.
[01:45:59.179 --> 01:46:11.222]  And they use our love of life to de- to disinform, to program us, to deprogram us from our natural programming and give us a false program.
[01:46:11.222 --> 01:46:14.023]  They take our love and say, be loving, kill yourself.
[01:46:14.023 --> 01:46:15.843]  It's for Earth.
[01:46:15.843 --> 01:46:17.544]  I mean, do you see how sick this is?
[01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:22.592]  Okay, well it's clear I'm not getting to you.
[01:46:22.592 --> 01:46:23.533]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:46:23.533 --> 01:46:25.874]  I gotta move on to others.
[01:46:25.874 --> 01:46:27.876]  Do you think the earth may be overpopulated?
[01:46:28.695 --> 01:46:29.035]  I don't know.
[01:46:54.062 --> 01:46:57.746]  And then, you know, kill yourself.
[01:46:57.746 --> 01:47:08.718]  I mean, I don't want you to kill yourself, but before you kill somebody, or before you support this passively, because it's some primitive level, it gives you a power trip of, oh god, that feels powerful to kill people, oh yes!
[01:47:08.718 --> 01:47:13.183]  You know, before you get into that mode, show yourself the door, pal.
[01:47:14.301 --> 01:47:18.604]  Now, I know you're not really saying that, but I mean, to those that extrapolate out that view.
[01:47:18.604 --> 01:47:22.246]  I mean, I tell Holdren, I tell Kissinger, I tell them all.
[01:47:22.246 --> 01:47:23.587]  I wish them no harm.
[01:47:23.587 --> 01:47:26.789]  I wish they'd wake up and get their souls back.
[01:47:26.789 --> 01:47:31.933]  How is it moral that we need to die, but evil if we say they need to commit suicide?
[01:47:31.933 --> 01:47:34.735]  I mean, I tell Dr. Bianca Utt.
[01:47:34.735 --> 01:47:39.158]  Buddy, nobody's stopping you.
[01:47:39.158 --> 01:47:40.619]  Nobody's stopping you, pal.
[01:47:42.458 --> 01:47:46.100]  Me, I want every moment of life, I'm going to be like Darth Vader.
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:49.422]  I'm going to try everything I can to stay alive as long as possible that's moral.
[01:47:49.422 --> 01:47:54.845]  I'm not going to take Chinese slaves' organs, though, to do it.
[01:47:54.845 --> 01:47:57.126]  Coming up, I'm going to go over this Chris Matthews psychology.
[01:47:57.126 --> 01:47:58.146]  It's very important.
[01:47:58.146 --> 01:47:58.927]  Start of the next hour.
[01:47:58.927 --> 01:48:01.748]  Let's go ahead and talk to Phillip in Tennessee.
[01:48:01.748 --> 01:48:04.030]  Phillip, you're on the air.
[01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:08.232]  Hey, Alex, I'd like to touch on a news brief out of CBS Channel 2 Chicago.
[01:48:09.642 --> 01:48:12.504]  The police are now going to shoot at fleeing cars?
[01:48:12.504 --> 01:48:17.868]  Yes, no due process, and you only have to be suspected of committing a felony.
[01:48:17.868 --> 01:48:23.953]  They passed a law that the police can force you out of your house without a warrant or anything now.
[01:48:23.953 --> 01:48:28.576]  They got rid of the Castle Doctrine here too, in the name of hurricane evacuation, but it's wider.
[01:48:28.576 --> 01:48:30.277]  No, it's total tyranny is now happening.
[01:48:32.144 --> 01:48:32.405]  Yeah.
[01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:33.566]  Well, I knew you hadn't touched on it.
[01:48:33.566 --> 01:48:36.188]  You probably have a large stack of news to get on your desk.
[01:48:36.188 --> 01:48:48.938]  No, I'm glad you brought that up, because it's painful to go through these stacks, and I've got to make myself... In fact, producers make me do 30 minutes every day, where I just at least read the headlines, and folks can think what they want about it.
[01:48:48.938 --> 01:48:52.841]  Yeah, that's CBS, and the Army's going to be involved as well.
[01:48:52.841 --> 01:48:53.581]  They're going to gun us down.
[01:48:53.581 --> 01:48:54.262]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:48:55.728 --> 01:49:00.915]  Well, just wanted to make sure your listeners could Google that, I'm sorry, do a start page search on that.
[01:49:00.915 --> 01:49:03.939]  CBS Chicago, local police, deadly force.
[01:49:03.939 --> 01:49:05.080]  They changed their policy.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:10.407]  They now do not need to be under attack with a vehicle to open fire.
[01:49:10.407 --> 01:49:12.329]  No, they're just gonna... No, no, exactly.
[01:49:12.329 --> 01:49:13.211]  We're dead!
[01:49:13.211 --> 01:49:13.731]  I mean, look...
[01:49:15.154 --> 01:49:21.218]  When you read Pentagon documents from the 50s and 60s, they said, we gotta train the troops and police to kill citizens.
[01:49:21.218 --> 01:49:26.061]  How do we, and then after Ken State, they said, how do we train them?
[01:49:26.061 --> 01:49:28.222]  We train the public and the police at the same time.
[01:49:28.222 --> 01:49:31.604]  We give them soft kill weapons.
[01:49:31.604 --> 01:49:34.006]  They're called less lethal is their true name.
[01:49:34.006 --> 01:49:38.449]  And there's the headline, Chicago area, new policy allows police to shoot at fleeing cars.
[01:49:41.328 --> 01:49:42.769]  And it says, yeah, they don't have to be in danger.
[01:49:42.769 --> 01:49:46.393]  They're going to murder you if you try to leave.
[01:49:46.393 --> 01:49:50.277]  And next it's going to be, you didn't pull over quick enough so I killed you.
[01:49:50.277 --> 01:49:54.200]  Or next, you didn't know the police car was behind you so they're going to shoot you.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:50:00.406]  And there's this cult of just worshipping police and running around behind them and loving them and thanking them.
[01:50:03.427 --> 01:50:07.369]  It's very sick, and the Chicago police are a murdering mafia.
[01:50:07.369 --> 01:50:11.671]  They're allowed to beat up women at bars who don't give them more drinks, on TV, and don't get in trouble.
[01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:13.472]  I mean, it's just total mafia.
[01:50:13.472 --> 01:50:16.814]  Ron Aaron Russo talks about that in the Reflections and Warnings.
[01:50:21.434 --> 01:50:25.796]  I mean, I've got the Houston police chief saying they want to put cameras in everyone's homes, with straight faces!
[01:50:25.796 --> 01:50:33.139]  I had the Bergen County police chief on, they have police chiefs in New Jersey, over counties, and he said, I want to make everyone take a chip in the county.
[01:50:33.139 --> 01:50:34.379]  I mean, you know.
[01:50:34.379 --> 01:50:35.100]  Anything else, sir?
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:37.821]  You do a great job, Alex.
[01:50:37.821 --> 01:50:38.901]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:38.901 --> 01:50:41.042]  I'm glad you called about that.
[01:50:41.042 --> 01:50:43.903]  Human race will split into two different species.
[01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:46.884]  It says we will be a goblin-like creature.
[01:50:46.884 --> 01:50:48.725]  That's us right there, the little goblin.
[01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:50.366]  And the elite will be the super sapient.
[01:50:52.139 --> 01:50:57.321]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this might be the most important message you
[01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:12.953]  It looks like a cigarette.
[01:51:12.953 --> 01:51:15.136]  It feels and tastes like a cigarette.
[01:51:15.136 --> 01:51:17.379]  And even delivers nicotine like a cigarette.
[01:51:17.379 --> 01:51:23.567]  But because this is not a cigarette, it doesn't deliver toxic chemicals and tar into your lungs or discolor your teeth.
[01:51:23.567 --> 01:51:26.271]  The premium e-cigarette has no flame or ashes.
[01:51:26.571 --> 01:51:30.212]  And you can smoke it anywhere, even where cigarettes are not permitted.
[01:51:30.212 --> 01:51:34.614]  Because the vapor you exhale is only water, not dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:51:34.614 --> 01:51:35.714]  You've tried the gum.
[01:51:35.714 --> 01:51:36.914]  You've tried the patch.
[01:51:36.914 --> 01:51:38.335]  You've tried cold turkey.
[01:51:38.335 --> 01:51:40.816]  Now it's time to try the premium e-cigarette.
[01:51:40.816 --> 01:51:45.217]  By doing so, you will save 60 to 75% over regular cigarettes.
[01:51:45.217 --> 01:51:48.858]  If you'd like to learn more, visit premiumecigarette.com.
[01:51:48.858 --> 01:51:51.899]  That's premium, the letter E, cigarette.com.

[01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:54.400]  Or call 866-866-8666.
[01:51:55.661 --> 01:51:56.121]  866-242-9210.
[01:51:56.121 --> 01:52:01.886]  That's 866-242-9210 today.
[01:52:01.886 --> 01:52:07.931]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.931 --> 01:52:13.816]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.816 --> 01:52:19.962]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.302 --> 01:52:22.243]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.243 --> 01:52:24.724]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.724 --> 01:52:37.910]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:39.591]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.591 --> 01:52:41.452]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.452 --> 01:52:47.695]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:56.607 --> 01:52:58.189]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.189 --> 01:53:01.292]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.292 --> 01:53:06.278]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:53:08.131 --> 01:53:08.811]  We're good to go!
[01:53:32.346 --> 01:53:32.886]  We're good to go.
[01:54:12.092 --> 01:54:16.593]  Yeah, years ago I would run through all the news and I still cover 20-30 stories a day.
[01:54:16.593 --> 01:54:25.016]  But now I don't want to read this article about the police are going to gun down people that drive away.
[01:54:25.016 --> 01:54:29.897]  I told you they're giving the army and the MPs training that if you don't stop at a checkpoint they're going to kill you.
[01:54:31.224 --> 01:54:33.106]  And then it's in the mainstream news.
[01:54:33.106 --> 01:54:41.913]  They're training to have heavy machine guns set up at army checkpoints, at the military bases, and now they're doing drills out on the highways.
[01:54:41.913 --> 01:54:46.697]  Drills where they have the citizens fighting back, calling us terrorists.
[01:54:46.697 --> 01:54:51.522]  They're drilling to fight us, and just like Iraq, you don't stop at a checkpoint,
[01:54:52.142 --> 01:55:00.993]  And it's come out many times people aren't paying attention or whatever they just kill you and the police are just it's been announced CBS News see I should have opened the show with that.
[01:55:00.993 --> 01:55:08.001]  I should have opened the show with scores of White House openly funded and openly run.
[01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:10.544]  I mean these are direct members of his
[01:55:11.525 --> 01:55:14.888]  of the White House are now writing hit pieces on me.
[01:55:14.888 --> 01:55:17.130]  I mean, folks, it's scary.
[01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:22.775]  I kind of look at my kids every day and go, man, I sure enjoy life, like a bird flies by.
[01:55:22.775 --> 01:55:31.743]  I just enjoy everything because I'm not even really worried about them killing me, but I'm kind of like, man, I wanted to do some more fishing or more hiking or I wanted to see this or see that.
[01:55:31.743 --> 01:55:36.367]  And I'm not even saying that's going to happen, but I mean, there's a big article up on PrisonPlanet.com where
[01:55:37.168 --> 01:55:40.309]  Left-wing website with direct ties to White House smears Alex Jones.
[01:55:40.309 --> 01:55:43.530]  I mean, they're coming after me because they know I'm standing up to them.
[01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:45.050]  But what am I supposed to do?
[01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:49.932]  You know, at a fundamental level, I want to tell the globalists, I wish you'd wake up and stop being evil.
[01:55:49.932 --> 01:55:52.753]  But I mean, I can't let you put carbon taxes on me.
[01:55:52.753 --> 01:55:54.393]  I can't let you take my guns.
[01:55:54.393 --> 01:55:59.535]  I can't let you carry out eugenics and your White House science chief says he wants to take all our kids.
[01:55:59.535 --> 01:56:03.996]  I mean, you know, what am I supposed to do?
[01:56:03.996 --> 01:56:06.257]  We have a right to stand up and say no to you.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:12.463]  And I know a lot of people that work for the White House are not completely evil and immoral.
[01:56:12.463 --> 01:56:14.765]  Most of you are in the same boat as I am.
[01:56:14.765 --> 01:56:22.411]  And the minute you realize that we're all in this together and there's less than 6,000 superclass running this whole system, I don't understand why you're being part of this.
[01:56:24.895 --> 01:56:26.377]  And I don't know how you death threat people.
[01:56:26.377 --> 01:56:28.279]  And I don't know how you do all the things you do.
[01:56:28.279 --> 01:56:32.965]  And I don't know how you create fake Klan groups and get them to blow up buildings.
[01:56:32.965 --> 01:56:35.928]  And kill your own federal officers.
[01:56:35.928 --> 01:56:37.090]  You're evil!
[01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:37.590]  You're bad!
[01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:39.192]  And to you, you're beyond good and evil.
[01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:42.737]  We have to do all these evil things because the end justifies the means.
[01:56:42.737 --> 01:56:44.239]  And all this Machiavellian bull!
[01:56:46.365 --> 01:56:57.574]  But I mean, it's getting creepy, folks, when every couple days open George Soros-funded publications and open White House and open ACORN groups openly are attacking me.
[01:56:57.574 --> 01:57:01.297]  Me!
[01:57:01.297 --> 01:57:04.980]  I mean, I guess I am kind of one of the big chief leaders of this whole fight.
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:08.503]  I guess I'm the most radical and the most focused and the most hardcore and...
[01:57:10.618 --> 01:57:11.798]  I'm not even up to this.
[01:57:11.798 --> 01:57:13.519]  I can't even believe I'm in this position.
[01:57:13.519 --> 01:57:19.401]  I just am not laying down to these people.
[01:57:19.401 --> 01:57:20.721]  So I'll try to cover that later.
[01:57:20.721 --> 01:57:28.824]  I mean, this is really starting to creep me out, folks.
[01:57:28.824 --> 01:57:30.885]  Now they're trying to say I'm a terrorist and stuff.
[01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:44.604]  All because I'll read a CBS News story where they're gonna, and I point out, hey, shooting at a fleeing car, shooting at people at checkpoints, that's martial law.
[01:57:44.604 --> 01:57:47.789]  I mean, that's the most hardcore, that's a 10 on the Richter scale.
[01:57:49.923 --> 01:57:50.985]  It's exponential.
[01:57:50.985 --> 01:57:54.829]  And I said back in 1999, we were at a 3.3.
[01:57:54.829 --> 01:57:55.650]  I've said we're at about a 6.
[01:57:55.650 --> 01:57:59.075]  Stuff like this is bringing us up to a 7.
[01:57:59.075 --> 01:58:06.203]  And then when you go to a 10, that is house by house, grid by grid, taking America over, taking your guns.
[01:58:06.844 --> 01:58:10.667]  And death camps and lining people up and shooting them.
[01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:11.888]  And this is what happened in Germany.
[01:58:11.888 --> 01:58:15.311]  The Germans morally were much more moral than the American people.
[01:58:15.311 --> 01:58:17.653]  And look what Hitler did with their minds.
[01:58:17.653 --> 01:58:21.957]  And got them into evil, step-by-step, camel's nose under the tent flap.
[01:58:21.957 --> 01:58:24.279]  Same thing with the Russians, very moral people.
[01:58:24.279 --> 01:58:26.601]  Look what they did under Lenin and Stalin.
[01:58:26.601 --> 01:58:28.242]  Chinese, same thing.
[01:58:28.242 --> 01:58:32.486]  Folks, I'm telling you, this is a hot takeover.
[01:58:32.486 --> 01:58:34.848]  And they want to run a Soviet-style purge in America.
[01:58:36.431 --> 01:58:38.452]  He'll come back, take calls, and then get into all the news.
[01:58:38.452 --> 01:58:41.114]  Stay with me.

[01:58:55.843 --> 01:59:00.366]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:02.667]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.667 --> 01:59:04.288]  You don't have to cooperate.

[02:00:12.753 --> 02:00:17.595]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.595 --> 02:00:21.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.283 --> 02:00:44.610]  We're having fun during the breaks, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:44.610 --> 02:00:48.636]  The guys are in there talking about picking up waitresses for dates.
[02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:51.111]  Bad devils.
[02:00:51.111 --> 02:00:51.792]  That's good.
[02:00:51.792 --> 02:00:52.252]  That's life.
[02:00:52.252 --> 02:00:53.994]  That's a good, healthy thing.
[02:00:53.994 --> 02:00:58.640]  Okay, you're supposed to be metrosexual and shaking around women, not being a man.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:01.624]  Alright, let's just continue with the calls for a while.
[02:01:01.624 --> 02:01:03.226]  Then I'm going to get into all this news and attacks.
[02:01:03.226 --> 02:01:05.248]  I promise to go to your calls.
[02:01:05.248 --> 02:01:09.734]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here?
[02:01:11.041 --> 02:01:12.461]  Donna in Texas.
[02:01:12.461 --> 02:01:19.044]  Hey Donna, what do you think of police, not just in Chicago but around the country, are now going to shoot us at checkpoints if we don't stop?
[02:01:19.044 --> 02:01:20.624]  That sounds like America, doesn't it?
[02:01:20.624 --> 02:01:21.164]  Sounds like freedom?
[02:01:21.164 --> 02:01:22.005]  It does.
[02:01:22.005 --> 02:01:26.426]  Yeah, it sounds like the America we live in.
[02:01:26.426 --> 02:01:27.346]  What's on your mind, Donna?
[02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:30.727]  You've been holding like a trigger.
[02:01:30.727 --> 02:01:33.268]  I've just known about this for two weeks.
[02:01:33.268 --> 02:01:35.729]  And I am so overwhelmed, I don't know what to do.
[02:01:38.117 --> 02:01:46.781]  Well, don't be freaked out, just be glad you're awake now because it's kind of like if there's a field at night with a couple big pits in it and you finally get a flashlight and see the pit.
[02:01:46.781 --> 02:01:52.524]  It's kind of scary that I almost walked in a pit, but it's better than falling in there and breaking your neck, isn't it?
[02:01:52.524 --> 02:01:54.265]  Oh, definitely.
[02:01:54.265 --> 02:01:54.905]  But I don't know.
[02:01:54.905 --> 02:01:57.867]  Are we too late?
[02:01:57.867 --> 02:02:01.689]  Well, we are too late for the... Your life is going so fast.
[02:02:01.689 --> 02:02:03.830]  We are too late for the 50... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:07.061]  It seems like it's going so fast since Obama got in.
[02:02:07.061 --> 02:02:11.484]  Everything is just bam, bam, bam changing.
[02:02:11.484 --> 02:02:16.566]  And if you don't like giving up all your freedoms and being shot at checkpoints, you don't like black people.
[02:02:16.566 --> 02:02:23.830]  See, that's the mindless propaganda of don't be racist, let us make you slaves, but it's not working.
[02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:28.233]  People are waking up, but it is too late for 51 million babies.
[02:02:28.993 --> 02:02:56.866]  killed last thirty five years it is too late for all the kids killed by cps it is too late for our dead troops in the million that iraqis but it's not too late to stand up and do the right thing and that's all that matters even if he we've been involved in the evil some of us all of us have done bad things it's never too late to turn it around and so no ma'am it's not too late did you hear ron paul earlier about everybody waking up yet that uh... really what i i want to know what can i do i mean i've kept
[02:02:59.284 --> 02:03:03.886]  DVDs that I leave everywhere I go.
[02:03:03.886 --> 02:03:07.248]  Is there anything else I can do to stop it?
[02:03:07.248 --> 02:03:12.930]  Is there anybody we can trust in the government that we should vote for?
[02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:14.551]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:03:14.551 --> 02:03:16.992]  So you bought one DVD and are making copies?
[02:03:16.992 --> 02:03:19.913]  Yes.
[02:03:19.913 --> 02:03:21.574]  If a million people did that,
[02:03:23.533 --> 02:03:28.784]  And gave out 200 DVDs, and even half of those people paid it forward and made other copies.
[02:03:28.784 --> 02:03:30.869]  We would reach everybody in the country in a few months.
[02:03:30.869 --> 02:03:31.470]  You can do the math.
[02:03:32.256 --> 02:03:34.458]  So what you've done, you don't have to do everything.
[02:03:34.458 --> 02:03:39.642]  Call into talk radio, put up a website, go to city council and speak.
[02:03:39.642 --> 02:03:42.225]  Just create the buzz about these issues.
[02:03:42.225 --> 02:03:43.145]  It's already happening.
[02:03:43.145 --> 02:03:48.670]  You go to city council meetings, congressional meetings, they'll be there pushing their agenda.
[02:03:48.670 --> 02:03:50.872]  And people are, I don't want the carbon tax!
[02:03:50.872 --> 02:03:52.553]  It's a world government takeover!
[02:03:52.553 --> 02:03:54.215]  I want to abolish the Fed!
[02:03:54.215 --> 02:03:55.376]  I want us out of Iraq!
[02:03:56.076 --> 02:04:00.163]  At big Republican events like CPAC, Ron Paul says, end the war!
[02:04:00.163 --> 02:04:02.547]  And the majority stand up and clap!
[02:04:02.547 --> 02:04:05.612]  This is supposedly the most hardcore pro-war Republicans.
[02:04:05.612 --> 02:04:06.553]  They don't want it!
[02:04:06.553 --> 02:04:08.055]  It's all an illusion!
[02:04:09.315 --> 02:04:10.956]  We have to break the illusion.
[02:04:10.956 --> 02:04:12.237]  We're the majority.
[02:04:12.237 --> 02:04:13.417]  All the numbers show it.
[02:04:13.417 --> 02:04:19.260]  We just have to stand up so that we meet like-minded.
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:23.103]  Then the followers will wake up because they're just followers.
[02:04:23.103 --> 02:04:28.225]  So, you have to walk on faith, but faith becomes reality.
[02:04:28.225 --> 02:04:29.166]  You have to know.
[02:04:29.166 --> 02:04:31.767]  I knew 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:04:31.767 --> 02:04:33.848]  I didn't care if two-thirds of the radio stations I was on.
[02:04:33.848 --> 02:04:35.589]  I was on a lot more stations than I'm on now.
[02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:36.290]  Turned me off.
[02:04:37.577 --> 02:04:40.798]  The truth's what matters to me, not even my life.
[02:04:40.798 --> 02:04:43.579]  Because if I don't have the truth, I don't have a life worth living.
[02:04:43.579 --> 02:04:47.260]  And so, ma'am, God bless you and I can hear your passion and your spirit.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.621]  Just know you're doing what you can.
[02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:52.522]  And every little bit together brings down tyranny.
[02:04:52.522 --> 02:04:55.063]  Many hands might, like, work, Donna.
[02:04:55.063 --> 02:04:57.483]  Anything else, Donna?
[02:04:57.483 --> 02:04:59.344]  Uh, yeah, but you don't... Stay there!
[02:05:00.708 --> 02:05:04.950]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:06.950]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:15.473]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:05:15.473 --> 02:05:21.015]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:05:21.015 --> 02:05:22.636]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:05:22.876 --> 02:05:29.401]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:05:29.401 --> 02:05:40.450]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:05:40.450 --> 02:05:41.231]  That's right.
[02:05:41.231 --> 02:05:43.793]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:05:43.793 --> 02:05:45.375]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:05:47.296 --> 02:05:47.957]  We're good to go.
[02:06:00.643 --> 02:06:02.024]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.024 --> 02:06:04.006]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:06:04.006 --> 02:06:04.987]  Well, you should.
[02:06:04.987 --> 02:06:09.492]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:06:09.492 --> 02:06:10.293]  That's right.
[02:06:10.293 --> 02:06:18.961]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:06:18.961 --> 02:06:20.323]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:06:20.323 --> 02:06:21.464]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:06:21.664 --> 02:06:27.648]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:06:27.648 --> 02:06:34.533]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:06:34.533 --> 02:06:39.717]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:06:40.057 --> 02:06:41.518]  This is real.
[02:06:41.518 --> 02:06:42.558]  Don't miss out.

[02:07:01.001 --> 02:07:05.964]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:07:30.981 --> 02:07:31.121]  I think?
[02:08:05.945 --> 02:08:07.247]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.247 --> 02:08:09.008]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.008 --> 02:08:10.770]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.770 --> 02:08:12.352]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.352 --> 02:08:14.294]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.294 --> 02:08:18.118]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.118 --> 02:08:22.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.422 --> 02:08:28.484]  We are back live, finishing up with Donna in Texas, then David, Randy, Joe, Steve.
[02:08:28.484 --> 02:08:32.726]  Then I'm going to get to a bunch of news, video clips, audio clips.
[02:08:32.726 --> 02:08:36.667]  Open White House operatives attacking me on a weekly basis.
[02:08:36.667 --> 02:08:40.409]  It's getting creepy.
[02:08:40.409 --> 02:08:42.710]  We need your prayers out there, folks, more than anything.
[02:08:42.710 --> 02:08:45.531]  I know it's real and depend on it.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.683]  But we don't believe in miracles, we depend on them.
[02:08:50.683 --> 02:08:54.367]  My aunt's got a little thing hanging in one of her rooms that says that.
[02:08:54.367 --> 02:08:57.691]  We don't just believe in providence, we depend on it.
[02:08:57.691 --> 02:08:59.693]  Go ahead Donna, finish up your point.
[02:08:59.693 --> 02:09:03.338]  I just wanted to say that I do fear for your life and I will pray for you.
[02:09:05.319 --> 02:09:26.675]  Well, I appreciate that because, you know, it's not a game, it's not a joke, I've been attacked, I get a lot of death threats, and it's creepy to have the White House looking at us, to have National News attacking us routinely, to have a lot of other stuff I don't want to get into on air, but we know we're doing the right thing and we do it cheerfully, and I only bring it up because by exposing what they're doing, that makes it hard for them to do it.
[02:09:27.576 --> 02:09:31.023]  Uh, and so that's why I stay out in the open and stay prominent.
[02:09:31.023 --> 02:09:35.834]  Uh, it's just creepy, but it's also creepy because as I get more sophisticated...
[02:09:36.775 --> 02:09:40.798]  And as I get more understanding, I don't even hate them anymore at a primitive level.
[02:09:40.798 --> 02:09:46.002]  I'm more freaked out by them and more, my God, these are lunatics!
[02:09:46.002 --> 02:09:57.231]  They're smart, they're intelligent, they're focused, but they're just wicked, savage, hard control freaks who coldly manipulate human emotion and psyche and just do such horrible things.
[02:10:01.266 --> 02:10:09.254]  The only reason I don't want to be set up or imprisoned, that's probably what they'll try to do, or killed, is really I have work I want to continue.
[02:10:09.254 --> 02:10:12.678]  My only fear is I want to be here to protect my children, I want to be here to...
[02:10:14.881 --> 02:10:20.803]  And it sounds corny to those that are worldly and very fleshful, but I really just want to be here to help.
[02:10:20.803 --> 02:10:24.004]  And I want to be here to stand up against bullies.
[02:10:24.004 --> 02:10:27.464]  But I know there's a lot of other people that are standing up against bullies, and that's what matters.
[02:10:27.464 --> 02:10:34.326]  I just can't believe that this type of scum, Donna, run our lives, and I can't believe this bad dream just can't end.
[02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:36.287]  I mean, do you get where I'm going with this?
[02:10:36.287 --> 02:10:38.067]  Definitely.
[02:10:38.067 --> 02:10:39.768]  I'm scared to death now.
[02:10:39.768 --> 02:10:42.529]  And I was oblivious two weeks ago.
[02:10:42.529 --> 02:10:43.389]  How did you wake up?
[02:10:43.389 --> 02:10:43.829]  What happened?
[02:10:44.326 --> 02:10:47.188]  It's all the Obama deception.
[02:10:47.188 --> 02:10:51.752]  And Ben, I've given it out, and it's not convincing everybody, and that's what scares me.
[02:10:51.752 --> 02:10:54.574]  And I'm thinking, what more do I need to get to convince you?
[02:10:54.574 --> 02:10:59.098]  I still think, you know, the government won't do that to us.
[02:10:59.098 --> 02:11:02.961]  Well, sure they will.
[02:11:02.961 --> 02:11:07.844]  Well, did you hear me talk about the Stockholm Syndrome?
[02:11:07.844 --> 02:11:09.586]  Yes.
[02:11:09.586 --> 02:11:10.867]  I mean, that's what happens.
[02:11:10.867 --> 02:11:11.887]  The average person
[02:11:12.864 --> 02:11:13.944]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[02:11:13.944 --> 02:11:14.745]  God bless you.
[02:11:14.745 --> 02:11:20.006]  You might print off, you can just Google the Stockholm Syndrome, got a major psychological indexes.
[02:11:20.006 --> 02:11:26.288]  There's a lot of psychological isms they've developed the last decade or so that are ridiculous, but there's a lot of them that are real.
[02:11:26.288 --> 02:11:31.269]  This is one that's been around for 30 plus, almost 40 years.
[02:11:31.269 --> 02:11:35.290]  And it had been called other things previously, but why do people love their captors?
[02:11:35.290 --> 02:11:37.611]  Why do people get into being slaves?
[02:11:38.846 --> 02:11:48.512]  Why do pimps, I talk about the pimp game, the pimp game, there's a book coming out called that, the pimp game is the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:11:48.512 --> 02:11:54.316]  I mean, they get these young girls go to Hollywood or New York to be models or movie stars.
[02:11:54.316 --> 02:11:55.937]  They're 17, 18.
[02:11:55.937 --> 02:11:57.918]  A guy comes, he's nice.
[02:11:57.918 --> 02:12:00.840]  He gets her on drugs, gets her under his control.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.242]  Then he slowly starts beating her up, controlling her and
[02:12:05.675 --> 02:12:07.357]  Breaking her down.
[02:12:07.357 --> 02:12:14.604]  But most women, if it's done from a father figure, especially if they didn't have a strong father or father who abused them, that's who these guys look for.
[02:12:14.604 --> 02:12:17.167]  They break instantly and they want to be abused.
[02:12:17.167 --> 02:12:18.608]  They want to be dominated.
[02:12:18.608 --> 02:12:22.872]  They think that strength.
[02:12:22.872 --> 02:12:25.615]  And it's just sick to see what we've turned our women into.
[02:12:25.615 --> 02:12:27.036]  And our men are even worse.
[02:12:31.203 --> 02:12:34.865]  You know, the strongest women are defending the family and are strong and the center of the family.
[02:12:34.865 --> 02:12:36.326]  That's real feminism.
[02:12:36.326 --> 02:12:39.827]  Not this fake feminism of being whores and being used.
[02:12:39.827 --> 02:12:42.349]  They're just toys of powerful men.
[02:12:42.349 --> 02:12:43.709]  It's a savage trick.
[02:12:43.709 --> 02:12:44.690]  Very sophisticated.
[02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:47.231]  It goes off in a hundred different directions.
[02:12:47.231 --> 02:12:59.878]  The point is that... I got lost in the train of thought from my original thought.
[02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:02.852]  Oh, the pimp game.
[02:13:02.852 --> 02:13:04.815]  That's the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:13:04.815 --> 02:13:08.480]  He's burning you with cigarettes, he's beating you with a coat hanger, he's, you know...
[02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.269]  It's
[02:13:33.374 --> 02:13:35.234]  Ooh, I was just powerful just then.
[02:13:35.234 --> 02:13:37.735]  But they let the government shoot their kids up with poison.
[02:13:37.735 --> 02:13:39.736]  They let the government put poison in their water.
[02:13:39.736 --> 02:13:41.656]  They let the government spray them with chemicals.
[02:13:41.656 --> 02:13:44.237]  They let the government have unconstitutional taxes.
[02:13:44.237 --> 02:13:48.758]  A cop pulls them over, you see these big men just shaken and scared.
[02:13:48.758 --> 02:13:50.938]  They are facsimiles of warriors.
[02:13:50.938 --> 02:13:53.059]  They are facsimiles of men.
[02:13:53.059 --> 02:14:01.961]  A real man, a real warrior is understanding and calculating and realizing how society works and has discernment and
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:12.463]  Is gentlemanly and kind and loving, but at the same time can just unleash absolute savage attacks on people at a moment's notice if they have to.
[02:14:12.463 --> 02:14:16.725]  Not strutting around going, you know, tough all day.
[02:14:16.725 --> 02:14:19.345]  That isn't what a warrior is.
[02:14:19.345 --> 02:14:25.167]  And women, it's not beautiful how they're all trolloped up like insecure whores.
[02:14:25.167 --> 02:14:26.828]  You know, that's your modern feminism.
[02:14:28.717 --> 02:14:36.703]  You know, instead of their powerful spiritual strength flowing out, energizing and giving life to the family and the society.
[02:14:36.703 --> 02:14:43.707]  It's just the enemy knows all of this and they're scared of your power and they try to neutralize you and make you feel weak and insecure.
[02:14:43.707 --> 02:14:46.289]  You have the energy of the universe in you.
[02:14:46.289 --> 02:14:48.931]  You are made in the image of the creator of the universe.
[02:14:48.931 --> 02:14:52.113]  And even if you don't believe in God and all of that, look what humans can do.
[02:14:52.113 --> 02:14:55.476]  We're flying around in airplanes, computers, technology, science.
[02:14:57.398 --> 02:15:10.406]  You know, there are mathematicians that can calculate, you know, billions of numbers, idiot savants, you know, just incredible visions of mathematics and understanding and literature and art and poetry and all of it.
[02:15:10.406 --> 02:15:17.771]  I mean, I am nothing special and my mind burns with discernment and understanding and systems and it's indescribable.
[02:15:18.973 --> 02:15:25.058]  That is your destiny, ladies and gentlemen, not to be some insecure yuppie out washing their car.
[02:15:25.058 --> 02:15:32.744]  I'm not saying washing your car is bad, but you know, if that's your God, if that's all that matters, if it's lower down your hierarchy of needs, that's fine.
[02:15:32.744 --> 02:15:39.809]  I'm saying if your identity is, you know what I'm talking about, folks, it's just get your humanity back.
[02:15:39.809 --> 02:15:45.554]  Stop caring what people think, stop buying into the evil, and get real.
[02:15:49.259 --> 02:15:56.063]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:15:56.063 --> 02:15:59.045]  I've been listening to you religiously for about a year.
[02:15:59.045 --> 02:16:05.969]  I listen to all your podcasts mainly because I'm afraid I'm going to miss something important.
[02:16:05.969 --> 02:16:06.689]  I'd like to talk a
[02:16:12.394 --> 02:16:15.497]  I have seen a little bit of videos and things, yeah.
[02:16:29.728 --> 02:16:38.961]  Um, it's almost like a coast-to-coast to talk about a lot of different things, but I mainly go there to see what's new about the New World Order related info.
[02:16:38.961 --> 02:16:42.986]  And they had a guest speaker on.
[02:16:42.986 --> 02:16:44.669]  His name is Burke Elder Hale.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:52.743]  And, uh, I guess he knows and talks to a senior biochemist from a major pharmaceutical organization.
[02:16:52.743 --> 02:17:02.428]  They won't say who it is, but because it's pertaining to vaccines and H1N1 virus, I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out who they're talking about.
[02:17:03.434 --> 02:17:20.314]  Um, but basically, um, Hale's saying that this, uh, senior biochemist was telling him that, uh, these chemtrails, uh, which have been out for many, many years that people have been inhaling, um, are what's considered an aerosol precursor.
[02:17:20.314 --> 02:17:21.896]  And... That's a binary weapon.
[02:17:22.793 --> 02:17:23.654]  Correct.
[02:17:23.654 --> 02:17:28.877]  And I don't need to have some unconfirmed source to do that.
[02:17:28.877 --> 02:17:30.638]  We have the research, the evidence.
[02:17:30.638 --> 02:17:37.442]  I had a team for a week in California with the scientists, with the medical reports, with state reports.
[02:17:37.442 --> 02:17:42.825]  We've got just reams of it, 65 hours of footage, 64 hours of footage out there.
[02:17:42.825 --> 02:17:45.486]  And let me comment on that since you bring it up.
[02:17:45.486 --> 02:17:46.367]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:50.146 --> 02:17:55.268]  Number one, when you mention that particular source, I've seen some interesting things.
[02:17:55.268 --> 02:17:58.189]  I've also seen some pretty far out stuff, so I'll just say that.
[02:17:58.189 --> 02:18:00.469]  I don't really use that as a source.
[02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:02.270]  I have nothing mean to deal with that.
[02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:08.212]  It's just that I don't... I think it's important to have some sources that get into anything and everything.
[02:18:08.212 --> 02:18:11.153]  But when I just see a continual pattern of never confirmed, never whatever,
[02:18:12.665 --> 02:18:22.408]  And it seems people always latch on to what's not confirmed, instead of, oh, here's the documents for the clergy response teams, or here's this, oh, that's fake, or, oh, we're really at level six, and two months later it's confirmed.
[02:18:22.408 --> 02:18:26.690]  You know, I have the document, I gave you the document.
[02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:33.032]  Yes, binary weapon system, that's certainly part of it.
[02:18:33.032 --> 02:18:37.453]  But there's multiple programs with the aerosol programs that are going on.
[02:18:37.453 --> 02:18:39.374]  There's a whole bunch of different programs.
[02:18:39.374 --> 02:18:41.815]  And hundreds and hundreds of them are public.
[02:18:42.711 --> 02:18:58.736]  I mean, just search engine a term like Biological Test Over Oklahoma Bacteria Sprayed or Biological Test Over Texas Bacteria Sprayed or Biological Test Bacteria Sprayed New York.
[02:18:58.736 --> 02:19:04.738]  Doesn't matter what state you're in, you're going to find an article.
[02:19:04.738 --> 02:19:11.560]  And then you read the name of the bacteria and you do a search on it and it's one that causes sterilization in all mammal species.
[02:19:13.123 --> 02:19:17.585]  It's one that causes spontaneous abortion in all mammal species.
[02:19:17.585 --> 02:19:25.449]  And then there they are in the paper saying, oh, we're spraying Oklahoma City and all surrounding, you know, towns this summer with this spray.
[02:19:25.449 --> 02:19:27.370]  And it's Septillus Globigi.
[02:19:27.370 --> 02:19:31.472]  And you go look up in Septillus Anthrillus, I forget the other name of the bacteria.
[02:19:31.472 --> 02:19:37.375]  But see, no one will talk about hundreds of mainstream articles spraying us.
[02:19:37.375 --> 02:19:42.277]  It's all, I heard a doctor who knows a scientist who talked to somebody who said a reptoid did it.
[02:19:43.482 --> 02:19:49.310]  And, you know, my whole issue is I'm covering what I can prove.
[02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:59.204]  Yeah, I mean, we got the White House science chief saying they're putting binary systems in your water to sterilize you and nobody wants to talk about that because it's official.
[02:19:59.204 --> 02:19:59.764]  It's official.
[02:20:01.223 --> 02:20:08.212]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.

[02:21:01.169 --> 02:21:07.834]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:07.834 --> 02:21:15.959]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:15.959 --> 02:21:24.125]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:24.125 --> 02:21:28.868]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:29.208 --> 02:21:34.431]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:34.431 --> 02:21:38.773]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:38.773 --> 02:21:39.854]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:39.854 --> 02:21:44.356]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:44.356 --> 02:21:49.259]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:49.259 --> 02:21:52.261]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:52.261 --> 02:21:53.901]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.083 --> 02:21:58.103]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:58.103 --> 02:22:07.345]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.345 --> 02:22:13.227]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:22:13.227 --> 02:22:19.368]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:19.648 --> 02:22:21.689]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:21.689 --> 02:22:24.151]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:22:24.151 --> 02:22:37.338]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:22:37.338 --> 02:22:39.019]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.019 --> 02:22:40.880]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:47.104]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:47.777 --> 02:22:56.022]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.022 --> 02:22:57.603]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.603 --> 02:23:00.424]  The people strike back.
[02:23:00.424 --> 02:23:07.808]  As you already know, drinking pure, high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:23:07.808 --> 02:23:12.491]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:23:12.491 --> 02:23:17.354]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:23:17.674 --> 02:23:25.420]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:29.983]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[02:23:29.983 --> 02:23:35.887]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:23:36.187 --> 02:23:42.151]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[02:23:51.576 --> 02:23:52.297]  That's 269-216-9767 today!
[02:24:04.628 --> 02:24:11.854]  Alright, we're going back to your calls, and I'm getting to Chris Matthews attacking us in the White House, sending their surrogates after me, and a bunch of other news.
[02:24:11.854 --> 02:24:18.659]  But, the Federal Reserve plunging in the polls, people figuring out who the real enemy is, that's coming up.
[02:24:18.659 --> 02:24:22.903]  But I want to talk to a bunch of callers here in a moment.
[02:24:22.903 --> 02:24:30.129]  But Paul Hartman, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I did, years ago, catch a little bit of a show about the pimp game.
[02:24:31.323 --> 02:24:37.207]  And when I saw it, and then I researched it more, that's how the elite treat the general public.
[02:24:37.207 --> 02:24:42.931]  And it is the Stockholm Syndrome, or similar to it, where they love their abusers.
[02:24:42.931 --> 02:24:47.574]  They give up, think they're powerless, and are then like children, or like a dog you beat.
[02:24:47.574 --> 02:24:48.895]  It just loves you more.
[02:24:48.895 --> 02:24:49.936]  It just grovels more.
[02:24:51.209 --> 02:24:57.095]  And they've taken our fighting spirit as Americans and broke our back and made us capitulate like a whore!
[02:24:57.095 --> 02:25:03.441]  And you were in there saying you're trying to find the clip online because we want to play it of what pimps up, hoes down, was the name of the show on HBO.
[02:25:03.441 --> 02:25:08.766]  But you were telling the story, Paul Hartman, out during the break with great precision.
[02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:09.546]  Repeat that story.
[02:25:10.672 --> 02:25:20.201]  Well, it's just a part, and I don't know if it's the documentary Pimps Up, Hoes Down, they kind of showcase all these famous pimps throughout the U.S.
[02:25:20.201 --> 02:25:34.974]  and I don't know if it's Pimpin' Ken or Don Magic Juan, they're kind of big pimps in the whole hip-hop world and one of them is there in the corner telling a story about how one of his workers, one of his hoes, has
[02:25:37.031 --> 02:26:04.689]  was had gotten beat up, shot, stabbed, the whole nine and he goes to the hospital and she's in the recovery room and whatnot and the worker, I hate to say the word hoe, but the whore lady was saying, oh baby I'm gonna get better, I'm gonna get up on them streets, I'm gonna make that money for you, I'll be better, don't worry about it, I'll be out there, I got you, I love you baby, I'm gonna make this money for you and
[02:26:05.649 --> 02:26:05.889]  I think?
[02:26:22.563 --> 02:26:24.765]  Woman who just obviously was brainwashed.
[02:26:24.765 --> 02:26:25.646]  Under mind control.
[02:26:25.646 --> 02:26:29.089]  But see, it's double think, or what they call Crime Stopping Orwell.
[02:26:29.089 --> 02:26:32.491]  Because Orwell had worked with the Soviets, then with British intelligence.
[02:26:32.491 --> 02:26:37.836]  Well, British intelligence, then the Soviets, then found out it was all run from the top by British intel.
[02:26:37.836 --> 02:26:39.517]  And that's what 1984 is about.
[02:26:39.517 --> 02:26:44.802]  Fake wars with East Asia, with Russia, with Airstrip One in the U.S.
[02:26:44.802 --> 02:26:46.203]  really is a war against the people.
[02:26:46.203 --> 02:26:49.366]  And he figures out the government stage in the terror attacks, all of it,
[02:26:50.287 --> 02:26:55.550]  He worked with OSS in the highest levels of propaganda, and then it's clear they killed him.
[02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:57.892]  One year after that book came out, he died mysteriously.
[02:26:57.892 --> 02:27:00.754]  He even went and hid out on an island in Scotland when he was writing it.
[02:27:00.754 --> 02:27:01.894]  He ran away from them.
[02:27:01.894 --> 02:27:04.036]  Eric Blair was his real name.
[02:27:04.036 --> 02:27:06.117]  But he talks about pimping the hoes, basically.
[02:27:06.117 --> 02:27:07.298]  The breaking of the spirit.
[02:27:08.278 --> 02:27:11.339]  And, uh, you know, the pimps will take 99% of the money.
[02:27:11.339 --> 02:27:12.920]  These women will be having nothing.
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:15.041]  And the worse they treat them, the more they love it.
[02:27:15.041 --> 02:27:17.902]  And it's the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:27:17.902 --> 02:27:21.283]  And Barack Obama is our American pimp.
[02:27:21.283 --> 02:27:22.984]  He is literally pimping us.
[02:27:22.984 --> 02:27:25.325]  Lying, just like Bush, but even worse.
[02:27:26.935 --> 02:27:28.857]  I mean, it's sick!
[02:27:28.857 --> 02:27:38.626]  Man, there's also a portion of this particular documentary I'm talking about where they're talking to the pimps and they're like, well how much do you break off to your hoes and this and that?
[02:27:38.626 --> 02:27:42.610]  And the person asking the question is like, you give them 5%, 10%?
[02:27:42.610 --> 02:27:45.913]  And all of them are like, I give them nothing!
[02:27:45.913 --> 02:27:47.755]  They don't want nothing, I'll give them some chicken!
[02:27:48.939 --> 02:27:50.441]  They'll be happy they get them some chicken.
[02:27:50.441 --> 02:27:52.383]  I'll give them something to eat and a place to stay.
[02:27:52.383 --> 02:27:53.925]  But no, I'll take everything.
[02:27:53.925 --> 02:27:55.366]  I want everything.
[02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:55.907]  They don't get no 10%.
[02:27:55.907 --> 02:27:57.709]  That's my money.
[02:27:58.991 --> 02:28:04.833]  Well, you know, growing up in high school, I wasn't in the whole cool guy, not cool guy thing.
[02:28:04.833 --> 02:28:12.696]  I was kind of on my own way and didn't understand how everything worked, but I was popular because I didn't care about being popular.
[02:28:12.696 --> 02:28:23.879]  And then later as I grew up and realized how psychology worked, it's like the bad guy who drives the fast car and wears the leather jacket and is mean to his girlfriend is the guy that just has women just falling down over themselves.
[02:28:23.879 --> 02:28:28.101]  And I wasn't mean to my girlfriends, but I was very popular because I just wouldn't put up any crap.
[02:28:28.621 --> 02:28:29.581]  Well, it's even worse!
[02:28:29.581 --> 02:28:32.002]  If you treat them even worse, they love it!
[02:28:32.002 --> 02:28:32.863]  They love it!
[02:28:32.863 --> 02:28:35.724]  The public loves giving their kids cancer viruses.
[02:28:35.724 --> 02:28:37.905]  They love drinking sodium fluoride.
[02:28:37.905 --> 02:28:39.165]  They love having everything.
[02:28:39.165 --> 02:28:40.126]  They love cops now.
[02:28:40.126 --> 02:28:43.527]  Have you heard in Chicago, they're just going to shoot people at checkpoints?
[02:28:43.527 --> 02:28:44.847]  Yeah, I'll pull that up for you.
[02:28:44.847 --> 02:28:45.928]  Yeah, CBS.
[02:28:45.928 --> 02:28:47.889]  I mean, that is insane!
[02:28:47.889 --> 02:28:48.809]  That is insane!
[02:28:48.809 --> 02:28:52.210]  I mean, is that not pimping the hoes?
[02:28:52.210 --> 02:28:54.631]  I mean, that's saying, I'm going to even take your life.
[02:28:54.631 --> 02:28:56.052]  They're like, thank you, officer, good.
[02:28:57.355 --> 02:29:00.578]  That's Pimpin' the Hoes Squared right there, but that was the thing.
[02:29:00.578 --> 02:29:02.479]  Pimpin' the Hoes Squared!
[02:29:02.479 --> 02:29:05.402]  We are now blingin' some new nomenclature.
[02:29:07.481 --> 02:29:17.524]  But, you know, when I first met you about three years ago, I was working on your Sunday show, it slowly, it just kind of clicked for me about a month or two ago.
[02:29:17.524 --> 02:29:23.246]  I remember we were back there and I was, you know, the whole New World Order and how they treat the flock.
[02:29:23.246 --> 02:29:25.807]  And I was like, man, this is, I've heard this somewhere before.
[02:29:25.807 --> 02:29:26.807]  It's the pimp game.
[02:29:26.807 --> 02:29:27.427]  You can relate.
[02:29:27.427 --> 02:29:28.587]  It's the perfect parallel.
[02:29:28.587 --> 02:29:30.708]  It's the pimp game.
[02:29:30.708 --> 02:29:31.228]  Pimp game.
[02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:33.029]  It's what it's all about.
[02:29:33.991 --> 02:29:36.493]  I ain't no hoe though, so... Me neither!
[02:29:36.493 --> 02:29:38.334]  I ain't... Let's say it together!
[02:29:38.334 --> 02:29:39.315]  To the government!
[02:29:39.315 --> 02:29:41.196]  I ain't no hoe!
[02:29:41.196 --> 02:29:43.098]  I ain't no hoe!
[02:29:43.098 --> 02:29:44.939]  I ain't no hoe!
[02:29:44.939 --> 02:29:46.040]  I ain't no hoe!
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:47.061]  I ain't no bitch!
[02:29:47.061 --> 02:29:48.602]  I ain't... I ain't... Yeah!
[02:29:48.602 --> 02:29:51.604]  I ain't no hoe!
[02:29:51.604 --> 02:29:53.005]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.005 --> 02:29:55.527]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.527 --> 02:29:58.229]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.101 --> 02:30:02.762]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.762 --> 02:30:07.525]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:30:07.525 --> 02:30:10.486]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:30:10.486 --> 02:30:13.528]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:30:13.528 --> 02:30:17.150]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:22.834]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:30:22.834 --> 02:30:29.840]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:33.122]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:30:33.122 --> 02:30:33.382]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:30:33.382 --> 02:30:34.663]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:38.246 --> 02:30:44.511]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:30:44.511 --> 02:30:48.375]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:30:48.375 --> 02:30:50.136]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:50.136 --> 02:30:50.837]  Take action today.
[02:30:50.837 --> 02:30:52.098]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:31:00.708 --> 02:31:04.952]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:31:04.952 --> 02:31:06.953]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:31:06.953 --> 02:31:15.481]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:31:15.481 --> 02:31:21.025]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:31:21.025 --> 02:31:22.647]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:31:22.887 --> 02:31:29.389]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:31:29.389 --> 02:31:40.454]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:31:40.454 --> 02:31:41.214]  That's right.
[02:31:41.214 --> 02:31:43.795]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:31:43.795 --> 02:31:45.375]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:31:47.936 --> 02:32:06.001]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:06.001 --> 02:32:08.081]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:32:08.081 --> 02:32:10.522]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:10.522 --> 02:32:12.802]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:12.802 --> 02:32:14.423]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:14.423 --> 02:32:15.463]  There is a solution.
[02:32:15.703 --> 02:32:24.128]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:37.616 --> 02:32:43.199]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:22.269]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[02:33:22.269 --> 02:33:26.933]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[02:33:26.933 --> 02:33:31.016]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[02:33:31.016 --> 02:33:31.517]  When the man
[02:33:35.845 --> 02:33:37.025]  Alright, folks.
[02:33:37.025 --> 02:33:38.906]  It's enough of the immortal Johnny Cash.
[02:33:38.906 --> 02:33:40.867]  Alright, I'm going to get into news, then your calls.
[02:33:40.867 --> 02:33:44.329]  For folks that are holding patiently.
[02:33:44.329 --> 02:33:46.130]  Finishing up with the pimp game.
[02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:51.854]  It's not just men pimping women or government pimping society.
[02:33:51.854 --> 02:33:52.174]  Women!
[02:33:53.191 --> 02:33:54.052]  Run the pimp game.
[02:33:54.052 --> 02:34:04.738]  You know, you see these husbands, broke back, woman's dominating them, but the man's unhappy and so is the woman, because women are not happy in that position.
[02:34:04.738 --> 02:34:14.724]  And so, this whole pimp society, this whole Stockholm Syndrome society, is, only works in a slave, broke back system.
[02:34:14.724 --> 02:34:17.926]  Not in an upright, strong society.
[02:34:17.926 --> 02:34:22.189]  And, uh, only in decadent, degenerate societies does this operate.
[02:34:23.468 --> 02:34:40.043]  And the pimp game works with Valley girls and people's good little girls that run off to college and become slaves because mommy and daddy were so nice or things were so cushioned and they just didn't know how to stand up to something like that.
[02:34:40.043 --> 02:34:41.644]  Or they came from such poor families.
[02:34:41.644 --> 02:34:42.124]  It's the same.
[02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:54.601]  And the adults give their children to CPS workers, who are known pedophiles and criminals in many cases, and let them, in many cases, drug them out, rape them, kill them.
[02:34:54.601 --> 02:34:57.523]  And then the government says, that's how it is, you're going to take it.
[02:34:57.523 --> 02:35:03.689]  We have to get angry, with righteous indignation, we have to take action against these people.
[02:35:03.689 --> 02:35:06.312]  Because I don't want my children being slaves to the government.
[02:35:07.139 --> 02:35:09.361]  I don't want to be under bondage, folks.
[02:35:09.361 --> 02:35:10.201]  It's a spirit.
[02:35:10.201 --> 02:35:11.442]  It's an idea.
[02:35:11.442 --> 02:35:12.263]  It's a system.
[02:35:12.263 --> 02:35:13.444]  It's an attitude.
[02:35:13.444 --> 02:35:15.986]  And I'm saying, no!
[02:35:15.986 --> 02:35:19.249]  I am not your slave.
[02:35:19.249 --> 02:35:23.472]  So it's that simple.
[02:35:23.472 --> 02:35:26.214]  And we have to get aggressive.
[02:35:26.214 --> 02:35:28.076]  We have to get strong.
[02:35:28.076 --> 02:35:29.096]  We have to get focused.
[02:35:29.096 --> 02:35:29.797]  And we have to say, no!
[02:35:31.776 --> 02:35:40.242]  Because they train us how to push us around, and then now they're going, yeah, we're going to set up army checkpoints, and if you run the checkpoint, we're going to kill you.
[02:35:40.242 --> 02:35:46.586]  Yeah, LA and Chicago and Dallas police are going to shoot any fleeing car.
[02:35:46.586 --> 02:35:48.728]  That's so criminal, that's such tyranny.
[02:35:48.728 --> 02:35:50.649]  It's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:35:50.649 --> 02:35:57.714]  Now, I want to break down all these surrogate, White House-driven, George Soros, openly owned and paid for,
[02:35:59.139 --> 02:35:59.799]  Operations.
[02:35:59.799 --> 02:36:02.901]  This story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:02.901 --> 02:36:04.302]  It's important this get out.
[02:36:04.302 --> 02:36:14.267]  Left-wing website with direct ties to White House smears Alex Jones as the establishment intensifies its efforts to demonize his political adversaries as extremists and terrorists.
[02:36:14.267 --> 02:36:20.851]  A George Soros-funded left-wing website with direct ties to the Obama White House has parroted the months-old
[02:36:22.088 --> 02:36:27.514]  Debunked, smear, that Pittsburgh cop killer Richard Plosky was an Alex Jones fan.
[02:36:27.514 --> 02:36:34.882]  And see, they've now passed their hate bill, and the House and Senate now goes to conference to fully ban free speech in America.
[02:36:34.882 --> 02:36:37.104]  It just says, if we don't like what you say, we arrest you.
[02:36:37.104 --> 02:36:41.289]  And this guy, I guess, wants to be arrested.
[02:36:41.289 --> 02:36:44.112]  I mean, that is the equivalent of a commissar right there.
[02:36:45.598 --> 02:36:58.207]  ThinkProgress claims that it is a nonpartisan organization, yet is bankrolled by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a think tank headed by Bill Clinton's former Chief of Staff John D. Podesta, pictured top.
[02:36:58.207 --> 02:37:00.089]  It was also head of the Barack Obama
[02:37:01.493 --> 02:37:02.053]  We're good to go.
[02:37:22.398 --> 02:37:25.800]  The more political 501c4 arm of CAP.
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:28.762]  You can also go look at their federal filings.
[02:37:28.762 --> 02:37:31.043]  Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie, Ford.
[02:37:31.043 --> 02:37:35.145]  I mean, and there's five or six big sites attacking me weekly.
[02:37:35.145 --> 02:37:39.428]  I mean, I am numero uno target now.
[02:37:39.428 --> 02:37:44.791]  It coordinates closely with Common Purpose Project, an effort to create message discipline
[02:37:46.064 --> 02:37:47.765]  Among the pro-Obama organization.
[02:37:47.765 --> 02:37:50.027]  So that means a master repeater.
[02:37:50.027 --> 02:37:53.969]  They put out up here at the top of the pyramid the orders, the nomenclature.
[02:37:53.969 --> 02:38:06.657]  You know, that war is loving and liberal, and hiring nothing but lobbyists is not hiring lobbyists, and letting the banks have $23.7 trillion is good, and Obama writing loopholes for all of them is stopping loopholes.
[02:38:06.657 --> 02:38:13.161]  And they throttle and attack any little left-wing site that doesn't stay in line.
[02:38:13.161 --> 02:38:14.582]  This is a master pimp.
[02:38:14.582 --> 02:38:15.043]  This guy
[02:38:16.334 --> 02:38:28.399]  Is keeping all a massive string of left-wing political prostitutes paid meager amounts from the White House fund to attack anybody that didn't for the world government takeover.
[02:38:28.399 --> 02:38:34.021]  I mean look at him, he's a pimp game.
[02:38:34.021 --> 02:38:36.402]  That's all this is.
[02:38:36.402 --> 02:38:39.284]  So he's a master commissar.
[02:38:39.284 --> 02:38:41.985]  And I take it as a great badge of courage and honor
[02:38:42.745 --> 02:38:50.609]  That weekly now, I have national publications and the allied propaganda arms of the White House attacking me.
[02:38:50.609 --> 02:38:51.910]  That means I'm doing a good job.
[02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:59.694]  Thank you, God, for giving me the guidance and directing me to... I know I haven't lived up to the full potential, but thank you.
[02:38:59.694 --> 02:39:00.694]  And thank you.
[02:39:00.694 --> 02:39:03.395]  Please continue to lead me against the enemy.
[02:39:03.395 --> 02:39:06.177]  And help me lead others against the enemy.
[02:39:06.177 --> 02:39:07.398]  And these people are the enemy.
[02:39:07.398 --> 02:39:09.759]  I mean, these are social engineers, official
[02:39:10.902 --> 02:39:17.947]  Textbook, with the head of the White House, science running it, to sterilize, take all children, forcibly sterilize you.
[02:39:17.947 --> 02:39:18.828]  World government.
[02:39:18.828 --> 02:39:22.551]  Open, I mean, open, public, mainstream, Associated Press.
[02:39:22.551 --> 02:39:25.914]  With mainstream news going, what's wrong with sterilizing everybody?
[02:39:27.762 --> 02:39:31.848]  I mean, these people are hardcore savage off the hook.
[02:39:31.848 --> 02:39:33.970]  I mean, they are wild men.
[02:39:33.970 --> 02:39:35.833]  I mean, that is bold.
[02:39:35.833 --> 02:39:37.175]  You gotta hand it to them.
[02:39:37.175 --> 02:39:40.860]  I mean, they're running the show and they're spiking your water and it's funny.
[02:39:47.113 --> 02:39:48.394]  Direct ties to the White House.
[02:39:48.394 --> 02:39:59.898]  Think progress was vehemently anti-war during the Bush administration, but since Obama took power, bombing brown people in broken back third world countries has apparently become a progressive and liberal virtue.
[02:39:59.898 --> 02:40:02.419]  And if you're against it, you're a racist!
[02:40:02.419 --> 02:40:06.121]  Oh, you don't want to take black foster kids and test pesticide on them until they die?
[02:40:07.595 --> 02:40:15.022]  I've been attacked for talking... Jones crazily says there's eugenics in a plan to... Hell, I'm sourcing New York Daily News with them killing the black kids.
[02:40:15.022 --> 02:40:15.562]  What?
[02:40:15.562 --> 02:40:17.684]  I don't want to kill black babies so I'm a racist?
[02:40:17.684 --> 02:40:19.145]  I mean, you people make me sick.
[02:40:19.145 --> 02:40:23.969]  I don't have a Margaret Singer statue in my backyard like some of you guys do?
[02:40:23.969 --> 02:40:25.190]  Who call blacks subhuman?
[02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:29.194]  You mean I'm a racist?
[02:40:29.194 --> 02:40:35.099]  So you got your little front man out there and you got all these people, not just people, that are
[02:40:39.537 --> 02:40:44.040]  Being pimped by the system, you've got the house slaves, the people that think they're part of the system.
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:47.782]  And then you've got the general public that are out in the barn.
[02:40:47.782 --> 02:40:49.183]  And that's what this society's turned into.
[02:40:49.183 --> 02:40:52.185]  We're all slaves, and they want us fighting with each other.
[02:40:52.185 --> 02:40:53.245]  That's what they love saying.
[02:40:53.245 --> 02:41:03.932]  We need to have more of a debate about race, to always keep it in the front burner, and fighting with each other, instead of fighting with the bankers and their little pimps that carry out their operations.
[02:41:09.264 --> 02:41:09.945]  Front story, me.
[02:41:09.945 --> 02:41:10.165]  I'm evil.
[02:41:10.165 --> 02:41:10.325]  I'm bad.
[02:41:10.325 --> 02:41:10.985]  I'm a terrorist.
[02:41:37.574 --> 02:41:41.677]  How on earth can driving the White House's message and agenda be deemed non-partisan?
[02:41:41.677 --> 02:41:47.041]  I think progress is nothing more than an echo chamber for Obama administration propaganda.
[02:41:47.921 --> 02:41:49.822]  It's the Free Republic of the Left Wing.
[02:41:49.822 --> 02:41:54.963]  It's about as non-partisan as the Communist Party propaganda organ Pravda was during the Cold War.
[02:41:54.963 --> 02:41:58.544]  Through the Center for American Progress is shy about revealing its funders.
[02:41:58.544 --> 02:42:12.249]  According to Sourcewatch, no less than 58 foundations have donated $15 million since 2003, as well as corporations and elitist philanthropists such as George Soros, and I would add David Rockefeller, who donated $3 million for general support in 2006.
[02:42:14.133 --> 02:42:18.615]  In an article about Representative Louie Gohmert's appearance on the Alex Jones Show last week,
[02:42:20.233 --> 02:42:21.754]  They warn about the health care bill.
[02:42:21.754 --> 02:42:31.501]  ThinkProgress attempts to discredit the subject of referring to the host Jones as radical conspiracy theorist because of his views on the Oklahoma City bombing and 9-11.
[02:42:31.501 --> 02:42:45.791]  The editors of ThinkProgress are apparently lagging far behind the understanding of public opinion, seemingly unaware of the fact that polls taken three years ago by New York Times show that an overwhelming majority, 84%, of Americans have doubts about the official 9-11 story.
[02:42:47.728 --> 02:43:01.477]  The article also calls Jones' claim that White House science czar John P. Holdren's advocated putting sterilants in the water supply a conspiracy theory, despite the fact that it's clearly documented in his own book, excerpts of which have been posted on the internet.
[02:43:01.477 --> 02:43:10.443]  However, ThinkProgress must egregious smear attempts in the last paragraph of the article.
[02:43:10.443 --> 02:43:13.646]  And it goes on from there, to basically say I'm a cop killer.
[02:43:15.435 --> 02:43:17.756]  That I'm, you know, leading cop killers.
[02:43:17.756 --> 02:43:21.898]  And that's because they want to sic the police on the public, and that's their hate crime.
[02:43:21.898 --> 02:43:22.818]  They can't win.
[02:43:22.818 --> 02:43:24.099]  They're losing.
[02:43:24.099 --> 02:43:26.220]  They can't intimidate any people as commissars.
[02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:29.642]  We're not the poor Russians with a history of being slaves to the czars.
[02:43:29.642 --> 02:43:30.842]  We're Americans.
[02:43:30.842 --> 02:43:33.083]  I'm not bashing the Russians, just our history's different.
[02:43:33.083 --> 02:43:38.106]  You may have drugged us with food and entertainment and all the crap, but people are waking up.
[02:43:38.846 --> 02:43:42.530]  The Giant's rubbing the sleep from his eyes and going, oooh!
[02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:45.633]  And the establishment's going, uh, get those Patriots, Giant!
[02:43:45.633 --> 02:43:46.735]  They're the bad one!
[02:43:46.735 --> 02:43:47.375]  Get those!
[02:43:47.375 --> 02:43:48.817]  Let us have all the banker money!
[02:43:48.817 --> 02:43:49.297]  Let us!
[02:43:49.297 --> 02:43:51.540]  Here, drink some more fluoride, Giant!
[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:53.582]  The Giant's going, you bad!
[02:43:53.582 --> 02:43:55.484]  You banker!
[02:43:55.484 --> 02:43:58.187]  And, uh, you know, they don't like it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:01.974 --> 02:44:08.280]  Despite his outlandish views, George Soros writes, David Rockefeller writes, that's who's writing this, his publication.
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:13.104]  Despite his outlandish views, Jones' influence cannot be underestimated.
[02:44:13.104 --> 02:44:15.146]  People are listening to The Millions every week!
[02:44:16.874 --> 02:44:17.575]  Now that is not true.
[02:44:39.949 --> 02:44:43.391]  I am not one of the biggest voices in the birther movement.
[02:44:43.391 --> 02:44:48.094]  I did not even cover it in the Obama Deception, because I can prove everything in the Obama Deception.
[02:44:48.094 --> 02:44:49.975]  I can't prove the birther thing.
[02:44:49.975 --> 02:44:53.398]  We've probably done ten shows on it out of five hundred.
[02:44:53.398 --> 02:44:58.581]  You know, I've been doing this for a year and a half, probably four hundred, five hundred shows.
[02:44:58.581 --> 02:45:03.664]  But the way they're acting suspicious about it, not releasing the original, but a receipt, is getting suspicious.
[02:45:03.664 --> 02:45:06.946]  But see, that's pointless.
[02:45:06.946 --> 02:45:07.867]  The issue here is,
[02:45:09.136 --> 02:45:20.602]  Richard Poplaski posted on hundreds of sites and attacked me on scores of sites and attacked me on my own website, but here's the big issue that everybody needs to have sink in.
[02:45:20.602 --> 02:45:23.124]  Within two hours of him killing three cops.
[02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:28.790]  At his house, because his mother was kicking him out because his dogs were peeing on the floor.
[02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:31.511]  Spoiled brat with a bunch of pit bulls he couldn't take care of.
[02:45:31.511 --> 02:45:33.191]  Kicked out of the Marines.
[02:45:33.191 --> 02:45:35.412]  He was drunk, got home at 2-3 in the morning.
[02:45:35.412 --> 02:45:37.532]  She wakes him up at 6-37, screaming at him.
[02:45:37.532 --> 02:45:40.773]  He throws a fit, the cops get there, he shoots him.
[02:45:40.773 --> 02:45:41.553]  Horrible person.
[02:45:41.553 --> 02:45:43.714]  Reportedly came out on the street and shot him.
[02:45:43.714 --> 02:45:49.115]  Of course, it's bad too that Chicago cops are gonna shoot people that quote, run away or don't stop fast enough.
[02:45:49.115 --> 02:45:50.936]  So, you know, we're humans too, pal.
[02:45:53.063 --> 02:45:55.745]  But it'll be good when they kill us in cold blood, you know.
[02:45:55.745 --> 02:46:06.895]  But the issue is that Plosky does this, and within two hours of them having his computer, they go to the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center handler.
[02:46:06.895 --> 02:46:08.797]  The handler.
[02:46:08.797 --> 02:46:09.498]  They're in the town.
[02:46:11.007 --> 02:46:21.230]  The local guy that writes articles about this, keep everybody stirred up, at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and they say he's a huge fan, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, who's seen the computer.
[02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:22.310]  Within two hours.
[02:46:22.310 --> 02:46:26.632]  Within two hours, Alex Jones is the number one target.
[02:46:26.632 --> 02:46:34.194]  And it turned out, it's now coming out in court, hundreds of sites, and we can search his handle, he was all over the web, attacking me, and they knew that.
[02:46:38.098 --> 02:46:42.342]  So, what does that tell you out there?
[02:46:42.342 --> 02:46:52.471]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Private Intelligence Arms of the National Security Council of the White House, both parties, are after me, folks.
[02:46:52.471 --> 02:46:55.314]  And here is the George Soros, David Rockefeller-funded.
[02:46:55.314 --> 02:46:56.515]  They always mention Soros.
[02:46:56.515 --> 02:46:59.218]  The Rockefellers fund more when you go look at this group.
[02:46:59.218 --> 02:47:01.600]  And all these others, they are out to get me.
[02:47:09.119 --> 02:47:24.492]  Now, Daily Kos, Raw Story, and a bunch of others that have some foundation money going to them, they apologized when the quotes came out that Poplowski was attacking me, because I wasn't for violence, and because I don't make it all about Jews.
[02:47:24.492 --> 02:47:27.775]  They retracted.
[02:47:27.775 --> 02:47:31.138]  But not the New York Times.
[02:47:31.138 --> 02:47:32.359]  They went after me with it.
[02:47:35.762 --> 02:47:40.226]  The White House is putting out the same thing, and it's not going to help you.
[02:47:40.226 --> 02:47:43.649]  And if you kill me, everybody's going to know what's going on.
[02:47:43.649 --> 02:47:45.250]  And I know you kill a lot of people.
[02:47:45.250 --> 02:47:46.391]  Your handlers have.
[02:47:46.391 --> 02:47:53.658]  And if you've set me up, I'm as pure as the driven snow, except for speeding occasionally, and I'm trying to control myself.
[02:47:53.658 --> 02:47:58.542]  But I just enjoy it.
[02:47:58.542 --> 02:47:59.623]  Look, you can't win.
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:02.721]  So that's the bottom line.
[02:48:02.721 --> 02:48:06.303]  And we don't want to escalate this into a violent situation.
[02:48:06.303 --> 02:48:15.608]  You want to make it violent, you want to start arresting people, you want to start banning free speech, you want to claim we're all terrorists and put us in a corner.
[02:48:15.608 --> 02:48:18.929]  There's smarter elites that know that this isn't going to go well for you.
[02:48:18.929 --> 02:48:25.133]  So I, you know, to the White House and to all of you,
[02:48:26.492 --> 02:48:27.133]  You're criminals.
[02:48:27.133 --> 02:48:28.154]  You're doing bad things.
[02:48:28.154 --> 02:48:31.616]  I don't know how you rationalize what you do, but c'est la vie.
[02:48:31.616 --> 02:48:36.820]  The truth is the truth, and let's start playing this Chris Matthews now.
[02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:37.701]  This is part of the clip.
[02:48:37.701 --> 02:48:44.546]  The whole clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:48:44.546 --> 02:48:45.287]  We need to cue it up.
[02:48:45.287 --> 02:48:47.468]  I think it's four minutes in, guys.
[02:48:47.468 --> 02:48:48.469]  Four minutes, 20 seconds in.
[02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:52.232]  I gave you the time code this morning.
[02:48:52.232 --> 02:48:53.073]  In this clip,
[02:48:54.238 --> 02:48:58.899]  They say that you're a crazy conspiracy theorist if you believe the Bilderberg Group wants a world government.
[02:48:58.899 --> 02:49:03.700]  Now remember, five years ago, the media said Bilderberg didn't exist, you were crazy if it existed.
[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:07.380]  Now they say, okay, if you believe they're setting up a world government.
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:21.023]  Bilderberg Group members write op-ed pieces, like Henry Kissinger in the New York Times, and they write articles in the Times of London, Financial Times, Time Magazine, called New World Order, Newsweek, calling for world government.
[02:49:23.482 --> 02:49:39.787]  And they say that we're mentally ill, and he lists some psychological tests, that we're howling at the moon, that we're insane, that we're crazy, that we're scum, that we're filth, that we're trash, that we're dangerous.
[02:49:39.787 --> 02:49:44.248]  They mix the birther thing with 9-11 truth.
[02:49:44.248 --> 02:49:50.570]  One guy goes off the talking point of attacking Ron Paul, but you notice Matthews is actual CIA, actual government op.
[02:49:51.670 --> 02:49:55.352]  So he corrects the propaganda, so he goes, wait, wait, that's an old piece of info.
[02:49:55.352 --> 02:49:57.113]  We failed there.
[02:49:57.113 --> 02:49:58.593]  Don't, don't bring Paul in.
[02:49:58.593 --> 02:50:01.054]  See, they tried to demonize him.
[02:50:01.054 --> 02:50:02.735]  They tried, but it didn't work.
[02:50:02.735 --> 02:50:04.756]  So now they're trying to embrace him in co-op.
[02:50:04.756 --> 02:50:06.097]  Not working.
[02:50:06.097 --> 02:50:06.397]  So see,
[02:50:07.611 --> 02:50:16.640]  You learned so much watching this one video, because they're talking about how desperate they are and how much power we've got and we're taking over, but, oh, we sure hope the Republicans embrace this.
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:17.881]  This will destroy them.
[02:50:17.881 --> 02:50:19.743]  That's like, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[02:50:19.743 --> 02:50:24.948]  This will actually empower the Republicans if they wanted to become populist and anti-New World Order.
[02:50:24.948 --> 02:50:29.473]  Every poll's got 70, 80, 90 percent, depending on the issue, against the New World Order.
[02:50:31.561 --> 02:50:34.703]  The reason both parties are falling apart is because everybody knows they're the same.
[02:50:34.703 --> 02:50:37.705]  So this is a desperate, desperate video piece.
[02:50:37.705 --> 02:50:39.666]  We're going to play and break down on the other side of the break.
[02:50:39.666 --> 02:50:42.147]  Then we'll take some more of your calls for folks that are holding.
[02:50:42.147 --> 02:50:45.629]  Then coming up in about 10-15 after Webster Tarpley joins us.
[02:50:45.629 --> 02:50:50.092]  I'm going to do a news blitz with Tarpley coming up.
[02:50:50.092 --> 02:50:53.134]  Ladies and gentlemen, totally jam-packed.
[02:50:53.134 --> 02:50:56.216]  A lot of people are watching right now live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:56.216 --> 02:50:57.957]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:50:57.957 --> 02:50:59.958]  If you're not a member, check it out today.
[02:51:01.348 --> 02:51:10.052]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:51:10.052 --> 02:51:15.174]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:51:15.174 --> 02:51:16.055]  and Canada.
[02:51:16.055 --> 02:51:22.578]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:51:23.138 --> 02:51:26.540]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:51:26.540 --> 02:51:28.981]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:52:01.357 --> 02:52:07.164]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.164 --> 02:52:14.753]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:14.753 --> 02:52:20.921]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.341 --> 02:52:23.303]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.303 --> 02:52:25.805]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:25.805 --> 02:52:37.375]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.375 --> 02:52:39.056]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.056 --> 02:52:40.918]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:40.918 --> 02:52:47.163]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:47.804 --> 02:52:56.098]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.098 --> 02:52:57.661]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:57.661 --> 02:52:58.863]  The people strike back!
[02:53:00.879 --> 02:53:05.401]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:53:05.401 --> 02:53:10.503]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:53:10.503 --> 02:53:12.004]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:53:12.004 --> 02:53:15.626]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:53:35.815 --> 02:53:36.996]  No animal testing.
[02:53:36.996 --> 02:53:38.337]  I use them and love them.
[02:53:38.337 --> 02:53:40.218]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:53:40.218 --> 02:53:41.638]  And I say big time.
[02:53:41.638 --> 02:53:43.339]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.

[02:54:18.271 --> 02:54:24.674]  But look, I talked about the first hour rising above these petty fights.
[02:54:24.674 --> 02:54:38.400]  I want to say to the people at the different George Soros funded organizations and groups, because I've run into some of them at events over the years, South by Southwest, I want to tell ThinkProgress and others,
[02:54:39.784 --> 02:54:47.987]  I know you're sold on benevolence and liberalness and if you could just have your global order of loving social workers, you're gonna help everybody.
[02:54:47.987 --> 02:54:52.208]  I know most of you aren't really evil, you're conned.
[02:54:52.208 --> 02:54:58.771]  And you also feel like you're part of the establishment and you went to college and have a PhD and you wanna get into government.
[02:54:58.771 --> 02:55:06.394]  And so you've gotta do a few evil things and spin and play politics to win so your greater good can be done.
[02:55:06.394 --> 02:55:07.294]  That's the road to hell.
[02:55:09.656 --> 02:55:11.637]  And I want you to know I'm not your enemy.
[02:55:11.637 --> 02:55:12.898]  And I'm sad.
[02:55:12.898 --> 02:55:21.322]  And you can laugh at me and say the White House Chief of Science called for taking everybody's kids at birth and putting them in government dormitories to be raised.
[02:55:21.322 --> 02:55:25.905]  But that's in scores of government textbooks and eco-science that he wrote.
[02:55:25.905 --> 02:55:29.727]  This is the full body of knowledge, as crazy as it sounds.
[02:55:29.727 --> 02:55:31.828]  But I bet a lot of you actually know the book says that.
[02:55:33.874 --> 02:55:35.095]  I mean, you think you're winning?
[02:55:35.095 --> 02:55:37.676]  You think you're in competition with me?
[02:55:37.676 --> 02:55:39.637]  Your kids are eating GMO food.
[02:55:39.637 --> 02:55:40.598]  You're being sprayed.
[02:55:40.598 --> 02:55:44.020]  You're drinking poison in the water.
[02:55:44.020 --> 02:55:45.301]  You can laugh at me all day.
[02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:46.481]  This stuff's real.
[02:55:46.481 --> 02:55:48.302]  The Atomic Soldiers were real.
[02:55:48.302 --> 02:55:49.923]  Project Shad is real.
[02:55:49.923 --> 02:55:57.067]  If you don't know about this stuff, if you haven't seen my film, Endgame, or you haven't seen The Obama Deception, I mean, they're free on YouTube and Google.
[02:55:57.067 --> 02:55:57.808]  Go watch them.
[02:55:57.808 --> 02:55:58.688]  Take notes.
[02:55:58.688 --> 02:56:02.170]  We have WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[02:56:02.170 --> 02:56:02.571]  We have
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:08.763]  TheObamadeception.net, they have full bibliographies of the films.
[02:56:08.763 --> 02:56:10.805]  I mean, I'm telling the truth here!
[02:56:10.805 --> 02:56:13.206]  That's what is of value to me.
[02:56:13.206 --> 02:56:20.512]  Not fancy clothes, or big houses, or being cool, or social climbing, or going to fancy parties.
[02:56:20.512 --> 02:56:22.633]  A lot of you are in intelligence.
[02:56:22.633 --> 02:56:24.375]  Go get my file.
[02:56:24.375 --> 02:56:25.896]  I'm pretty reclusive.
[02:56:25.896 --> 02:56:27.657]  I mean, I don't want your worldly stuff.
[02:56:27.657 --> 02:56:29.378]  I don't have a dog in the fight.
[02:56:29.378 --> 02:56:31.900]  I just think it's wrong to be shooting African kids up with HIV.
[02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:36.853]  I mean, it's pretty sick, folks, what you're involved in.
[02:56:36.853 --> 02:56:42.218]  And, you know, you can say I'm a kook and a liar and laugh at it all day, but you guys are pretty educated.
[02:56:42.218 --> 02:56:43.179]  You know I'm telling the truth.
[02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:53.124]  And I, a lot of you have a chance to turn back before you really get deeper into evil and realize you're with us, you're with the American people.
[02:56:53.124 --> 02:57:05.610]  Even if you're part of that 6,000 servant class to the elite families that Rothkopf brags about, head of the Kissinger group, you're still under attack, you're still losing your liberty and freedom.
[02:57:05.610 --> 02:57:08.211]  Listen to how desperate, then we'll go into the next segment with this.
[02:57:08.211 --> 02:57:11.893]  Listen how desperate Chris Matthews is here.
[02:57:11.893 --> 02:57:12.453]  Listen to this.
[02:57:14.941 --> 02:57:16.382]  Here it is.
[02:57:16.382 --> 02:57:21.606]  ...to be able to lay the groundwork for some sort of Manchurian candidate presidency.
[02:57:21.606 --> 02:57:27.030]  Well, Chris, this isn't really... And that is a full-mooner theory, by the way, that anybody thinks like that.
[02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:29.132]  This isn't really about facts.
[02:57:29.132 --> 02:57:30.313]  It's about emotion.
[02:57:30.313 --> 02:57:42.402]  And I can tell you from having, for example, covered one of the Tea Party events down in Kentucky, where I began as a reporter back in April, those same people that I saw there, some of them, the people who were worried...
[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:47.404]  See, I could spend an hour just on a three-minute clip.
[02:57:47.404 --> 02:57:52.529]  The whole clip's ten minutes, but I got three minutes marked out.
[02:57:52.529 --> 02:57:53.169]  Back that up.
[02:57:53.169 --> 02:57:54.951]  You notice he's addressing the audience.
[02:57:54.951 --> 02:57:59.996]  He says, there are people that think he's some kind of Manchurian candidate.
[02:57:59.996 --> 02:58:04.780]  No, there's people saying he may have been born in a foreign country and not be legitimate.
[02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:08.024]  But he takes that into, he's mind-controlled, trained in,
[02:58:10.328 --> 02:58:12.630]  Uh, Western China.
[02:58:12.630 --> 02:58:16.413]  So then he mislabels it as something kooky.
[02:58:16.413 --> 02:58:21.136]  Then he says, by the way, if you believe that, you're a kook.
[02:58:21.136 --> 02:58:22.257]  You're a full mooner.
[02:58:22.257 --> 02:58:27.341]  So, a lot of people hearing that, go, yeah, well I think there's something going on with where he was born.
[02:58:27.341 --> 02:58:28.902]  He goes, well, you're a kook.
[02:58:28.902 --> 02:58:30.744]  So he tells you how to think.
[02:58:30.744 --> 02:58:33.486]  First he misrepresents what we're saying.
[02:58:33.486 --> 02:58:36.128]  Then he says, and if you think that, you're a kook.
[02:58:36.128 --> 02:58:37.909]  Everything is psy-op trained.
[02:58:37.909 --> 02:58:39.310]  I mean, this guy's CIA.
[02:58:42.816 --> 02:58:46.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:48.282]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.206 --> 02:58:56.169]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:59:21.406 --> 02:59:21.886]  We're good.
[02:59:54.088 --> 02:59:56.448]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.448 --> 03:00:02.890]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.890 --> 03:00:05.430]  Think about Chris Matthews.
[03:00:05.430 --> 03:00:10.131]  I mean, they admit Anderson Cooper is CIA, CIA trained.
[03:00:22.293 --> 03:00:24.795]  Most of these Georgetown guys are.
[03:00:24.795 --> 03:00:26.797]  This guy's got intelligence connections.
[03:00:26.797 --> 03:00:29.619]  Clinton and Hillary are admittedly a fake CIA couple.
[03:00:29.619 --> 03:00:31.901]  We even know the name of their CIA handler.
[03:00:31.901 --> 03:00:34.483]  That's mainstream history.
[03:00:34.483 --> 03:00:44.491]  And everything's divide the people, inject race, but then always say it's for bringing everybody together.
[03:00:44.491 --> 03:00:45.452]  He's a limousine liberal.
[03:00:45.452 --> 03:00:48.034]  I don't know what's worse, these fake right-wingers or these fake leftists.
[03:00:48.034 --> 03:00:48.895]  They're all disgusting.
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:53.102]  But, uh, here he is.
[03:00:53.102 --> 03:00:54.764]  Let's go ahead and play Chris Matthews.
[03:01:10.803 --> 03:01:16.267]  Every time these guys deliver, there are 10 or 15 different talking points in different permutations.
[03:01:16.267 --> 03:01:20.050]  They always do little satisfied tics like, hmm, I'm really slick.
[03:01:20.050 --> 03:01:21.931]  I just said you're all kooks if you think that.
[03:01:21.931 --> 03:01:26.355]  And all the weak-minded followers will now buy into that.
[03:01:26.355 --> 03:01:27.736]  I'm doing a great job.
[03:01:27.736 --> 03:01:30.638]  But then this guy gets off the script and attacks Ron Paul.
[03:01:30.638 --> 03:01:33.040]  And Matthew says, no, no, we failed in attacking him.
[03:01:34.212 --> 03:01:34.933]  That backfired!
[03:01:34.933 --> 03:01:35.333]  Don't!
[03:01:35.333 --> 03:01:35.753]  Don't!
[03:01:35.753 --> 03:01:36.454]  Don't!
[03:01:36.454 --> 03:01:36.794]  Don't!
[03:01:36.794 --> 03:01:41.997]  You know, because, see, they wanted to tie Ron Paul to me on Fox and CNN and MSNBC, and they did.
[03:01:41.997 --> 03:01:44.779]  And it only made him bigger.
[03:01:44.779 --> 03:01:50.043]  And so then they try to attack us and say we're weak and we're kooks and this information's gonna backfire on us.
[03:01:50.043 --> 03:01:52.404]  But then they also talk about how scary it is.
[03:01:52.404 --> 03:01:56.227]  I mean, listen, no one listens to you, no one believes you anymore.
[03:01:56.227 --> 03:01:59.009]  They may not know about what all the lies are, but they know you're liars.
[03:02:00.592 --> 03:02:01.353]  So let's go back.
[03:02:01.353 --> 03:02:05.537]  I mean, look at this dinosaurs trying to manipulate and lie to the American people.
[03:02:05.537 --> 03:02:06.899]  Listen, you bastard.
[03:02:06.899 --> 03:02:08.300]  We're not telling people what to think.
[03:02:08.300 --> 03:02:13.586]  We're just telling them to unlock their minds and start paying attention to your tricks.
[03:02:13.586 --> 03:02:16.669]  Do you got me, boy?
[03:02:16.669 --> 03:02:17.991]  Go ahead back to that little bastard.
[03:02:19.841 --> 03:02:23.542]  It's down in Kentucky where I began as a reporter back in April.
[03:02:23.542 --> 03:02:39.669]  Those same people that I saw there, some of them, the people who are worrying about the government taking up the guns, the people who deny that the federal government has a right to tax your income, the people who are... The whole country started about taxation without representation.
[03:02:39.669 --> 03:02:47.412]  There's scores of little cell phone taxes and water taxes and federal and state fees they just add on without even
[03:02:48.593 --> 03:02:51.016]  Legislature's passing bills.
[03:02:51.016 --> 03:03:00.526]  They've got more than 15 bills now introduced to ban all guns if the Attorney General wants, to ban anybody he wants from owning a gun without even being convicted or arrested.
[03:03:00.526 --> 03:03:05.011]  You know, bills to shut down ammo, bills to register.
[03:03:05.011 --> 03:03:06.953]  And they just get up and say, there's no bills!
[03:03:07.774 --> 03:03:08.615]  There's no bills!
[03:03:08.615 --> 03:03:11.437]  I mean, that's why these guys have no credibility!
[03:03:11.437 --> 03:03:17.041]  And they keep lying, and lying, and lying, and it just gets worse from here.
[03:03:17.041 --> 03:03:17.962]  So, there you go.
[03:03:17.962 --> 03:03:20.063]  The feds can tax whatever they want.
[03:03:20.063 --> 03:03:23.566]  It's anti-American to ever question it.
[03:03:23.566 --> 03:03:24.407]  Just continue.
[03:03:25.196 --> 03:03:27.958]  We're worried about being overrun at the borders.
[03:03:27.958 --> 03:03:29.600]  Oh, hit pause!
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:30.820]  Oh yeah, we're not being overrun.
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:32.562]  There's just 30 million illegals.
[03:03:32.562 --> 03:03:46.913]  All the western states are on the edge or have already gone bankrupt because the illegal aliens aren't even bad people but they come here and get on welfare and they get free health care and they live 10 to a house and so it's destroying our standard of living!
[03:03:46.913 --> 03:03:49.836]  And the media always makes it, well then you don't like Hispanics then!
[03:03:51.752 --> 03:03:56.094]  Really, Gallup polls show 80 plus percent of Hispanics want the border shut down.
[03:03:56.094 --> 03:03:59.716]  They know they're losing their jobs, Hispanic Americans.
[03:03:59.716 --> 03:04:01.117]  See, that's another group think.
[03:04:01.117 --> 03:04:03.958]  Everybody who wants to control the borders is a racist.
[03:04:03.958 --> 03:04:11.302]  How about we don't want 500 million Latin Americans coming up here and turning this into Guatemala City?
[03:04:11.302 --> 03:04:12.523]  How about that?
[03:04:12.523 --> 03:04:14.363]  How about we don't want to be Mexico City?
[03:04:14.363 --> 03:04:15.004]  How about we want to
[03:04:15.936 --> 03:04:19.897]  Get liberty down there, but they use the US as a steam valve for Mexico.
[03:04:19.897 --> 03:04:22.378]  They would have already had revolution down there.
[03:04:22.378 --> 03:04:27.319]  So see, oh, there's these crazies who believe the borders are too open.
[03:04:27.319 --> 03:04:30.340]  There are these crazies that think there's a border problem.
[03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:32.241]  Oh my, these are really radical nuts.
[03:04:32.241 --> 03:04:34.962]  I mean, these are, I mean, my God.
[03:04:34.962 --> 03:04:40.443]  So they are tying the birther issue because that may be baloney, may not, whatever.
[03:04:40.443 --> 03:04:42.384]  So they can then try to discredit everything else like,
[03:04:42.944 --> 03:04:47.209]  And next they come back and go, there's these people that believe the Bilderberg Group wants world government!
[03:04:47.209 --> 03:04:50.974]  It's only in the newspaper a hundred plus times a week that we're setting one up!
[03:04:50.974 --> 03:04:53.276]  What's wrong with the crazy public?
[03:04:53.276 --> 03:04:56.220]  I mean... They're crazy, man!
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:04:59.404]  They think the borders are too open and that there's a world government!
[03:04:59.924 --> 03:05:00.804]  But the bankers are stealing money!
[03:05:00.804 --> 03:05:02.245]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.245 --> 03:05:04.225]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:05:04.225 --> 03:05:04.865]  Well, you should.
[03:05:04.865 --> 03:05:09.706]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:05:09.706 --> 03:05:10.506]  That's right.
[03:05:10.506 --> 03:05:19.168]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:05:19.168 --> 03:05:20.529]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:05:20.529 --> 03:05:21.669]  Plus, if you act fast.
[03:05:21.889 --> 03:05:27.871]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:05:27.871 --> 03:05:34.754]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:05:34.754 --> 03:05:39.936]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:05:40.276 --> 03:05:41.737]  This is real.
[03:05:41.737 --> 03:05:42.778]  Don't miss out.
[03:05:42.778 --> 03:05:51.364]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[03:06:01.223 --> 03:06:02.904]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.904 --> 03:06:07.645]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:06:07.645 --> 03:06:10.587]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:06:10.587 --> 03:06:13.648]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:06:13.648 --> 03:06:19.490]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.

[03:08:02.797 --> 03:08:09.440]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.440 --> 03:08:12.402]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:24.557 --> 03:08:34.680]  I want to do News Blitz and take calls for the rest of the hour, and riding shotgun with us is going to be Webster Tarpley just in a moment, specifically talking about where we've gone so far and where it's going in the future.
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:50.324]  But I wanted to finish up with this Chris Matthews clip where they say, if you think the borders are too open, or you think that Obama wants your guns, when the bills... I mean, his attorney general argued as a Justice Department lawyer last year for complete gun ban in D.C.
[03:08:50.324 --> 03:08:50.584]  Heller.
[03:08:51.966 --> 03:08:54.949]  Sotomayor wrote a book saying there's no Second Amendment.
[03:08:54.949 --> 03:08:57.733]  She was asked about it and she said, well, I won't say if you have a right or not.
[03:08:57.733 --> 03:09:00.155]  To even self-defense.
[03:09:00.155 --> 03:09:01.717]  I could list all the bills we have.
[03:09:01.717 --> 03:09:02.798]  It's in the Obama deception.
[03:09:03.882 --> 03:09:20.852]  The Obama deception was put out a month and a half after he was in office, and I show five different gun bills, with the bill number blown up, where the Attorney General can ban all guns if he wants, it just gives him that power, ban anybody flying who they want, to then say you can't own a gun.
[03:09:20.852 --> 03:09:22.993]  All extrajudicial.
[03:09:22.993 --> 03:09:28.356]  I mean, that's the thing, is that it's all happening right now.
[03:09:28.356 --> 03:09:33.099]  They're trying to reauthorize the assault weapons ban, which means any semi-automatic rifle.
[03:09:33.914 --> 03:09:35.939]  And this guy just says you're a lunatic!
[03:09:35.939 --> 03:09:37.362]  It doesn't exist!
[03:09:37.362 --> 03:09:39.426]  This guy is a hoax!
[03:09:39.426 --> 03:09:40.629]  It's all lies!
[03:09:40.629 --> 03:09:44.256]  And that's why Matthews has like a half million viewers or something?
[03:09:45.879 --> 03:09:50.062]  I mean, we've got more than that every 30 minutes here on the radio!
[03:09:50.062 --> 03:09:52.083]  They're legends in their own minds.
[03:09:52.083 --> 03:09:57.906]  They're meant to fool that small percentage of people that still watch TV and still believe these idiots.
[03:09:57.906 --> 03:10:02.910]  And O'Reilly, supposedly biggest thing on TV, has 3.5 million viewers top nights.
[03:10:02.910 --> 03:10:04.430]  Beck's got 3.5 million.
[03:10:04.430 --> 03:10:06.232]  Do you know what Beck has when he's on the radio?
[03:10:06.232 --> 03:10:07.853]  12 million!
[03:10:07.853 --> 03:10:09.774]  Limbaugh's got 22 million!
[03:10:09.774 --> 03:10:11.015]  George Norrie has 16 million!
[03:10:15.444 --> 03:10:18.365]  Google, uh, animatronics, what's it called?
[03:10:18.365 --> 03:10:21.306]  What's the Google system, computer?
[03:10:21.306 --> 03:10:29.388]  Says I have four end of, uh, unique, four plus million unique visitors to InfoWars alone each month?
[03:10:29.388 --> 03:10:30.708]  Google Analytics.
[03:10:30.708 --> 03:10:31.389]  Yes, there you go.
[03:10:31.389 --> 03:10:34.529]  I was engaging in ebonics and venting words.
[03:10:34.529 --> 03:10:36.130]  Legends in their own mind.
[03:10:37.333 --> 03:10:38.814]  Legends!
[03:10:38.814 --> 03:10:41.075]  Finish up with this propaganda, then we're going to Webster Tarpley.
[03:10:41.075 --> 03:10:41.756]  Here it is.
[03:10:41.756 --> 03:10:51.501]  The NRA, the rights of the NRA and so forth, a lot of those same rejectionist front, if you will, are out there looking for a reason to find a conspiracy.
[03:10:51.501 --> 03:10:53.822]  See, he's saying conspiracy theory.
[03:10:53.822 --> 03:10:57.905]  If you believe there's rights, he never says Second Amendment, it's always the NRA.
[03:10:57.905 --> 03:11:00.466]  See, which is a controlled opposition group.
[03:11:00.466 --> 03:11:03.108]  They never talk about your Second Amendment, it's always the NRA.
[03:11:03.108 --> 03:11:04.809]  Turning your right into some group.
[03:11:05.669 --> 03:11:07.952]  It's all about miscasting, mislabeling.
[03:11:07.952 --> 03:11:09.153]  These guys are trained in this.
[03:11:09.153 --> 03:11:09.633]  Go back to it.
[03:11:10.259 --> 03:11:12.380]  ...in the presidency of Barack Obama.
[03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:23.323]  There are just enough annoying little bureaucratic details that they can seize on, having to do with the original birth certificate, etc., which are all legally and factually beside the point.
[03:11:23.323 --> 03:11:28.244]  But there are enough of them that allows the people on the fringes of the party to do what they're going to do.
[03:11:28.244 --> 03:11:32.505]  And, you know, when the river is low, the riverbed is exposed.
[03:11:32.505 --> 03:11:34.586]  The river is low... Alright, hit pause.
[03:11:34.586 --> 03:11:35.406]  Hit pause.
[03:11:35.406 --> 03:11:36.807]  Let's talk truth again, Mr. DeSaver.
[03:11:39.488 --> 03:11:44.953]  When Barack Obama was elected, Congress had an 11% approval rating.
[03:11:44.953 --> 03:11:49.778]  In kind of the fake euphoria, it went up to 15 points, it's back down to 11.
[03:11:49.778 --> 03:11:53.021]  Rasmussen, Gallup, I've got them all right here.
[03:11:53.021 --> 03:11:57.646]  Gallup poll, I've got another one here.
[03:11:57.646 --> 03:12:01.950]  Over 50% think it should be abolished, that everything's their fault.
[03:12:01.950 --> 03:12:03.892]  I mean, you guys are in trouble here.
[03:12:05.152 --> 03:12:10.615]  Obama's approval rating has fallen from 84 to below 50 in Rasmussen.
[03:12:10.615 --> 03:12:14.517]  So, the river's low, it's Obama who's river's low.
[03:12:14.517 --> 03:12:16.258]  And yes, the Republicans are too.
[03:12:16.258 --> 03:12:19.020]  For the first time, we're having a real realignment.
[03:12:19.020 --> 03:12:22.982]  Obama was some psychological trick they tried to throw in.
[03:12:22.982 --> 03:12:26.824]  Well, he's got some brown skin, he's 6.5% African, and 40-something percent Arab, and 50% Anglo-Saxon.
[03:12:26.824 --> 03:12:27.425]  They'll think he's black.
[03:12:33.248 --> 03:12:36.069]  I mean, it's all hoaxes within hoaxes.
[03:12:36.069 --> 03:12:47.134]  So here's this guy saying the river's low, the Republicans are dead, they're all a bunch of conspiracy theorists, and the Republicans better run from these anti-New World Order birther people, Second Amendment people.
[03:12:47.134 --> 03:12:47.675]  No.
[03:12:47.675 --> 03:12:54.558]  If the Republicans ran to that and ignored their lobbyist special interest, they would then become the populist and be swept to power.
[03:12:56.906 --> 03:13:02.015]  Let's see, the lobbyists and the media, it's their job to keep... All these politicians are not that smart.
[03:13:02.015 --> 03:13:05.482]  They just follow what their advisors tell them, who are a bunch of propagandists.
[03:13:06.991 --> 03:13:16.396]  They try to demonize Ron Paul in a minute, and Matthews, being CIA, says, no, no, no, no, no, because they lost their fight demonizing him, so they've now capitulated, no, no, no, no, he's not with them.
[03:13:16.396 --> 03:13:23.300]  They don't want to give us, quote, anti-New World Order people the credibility of Ron Paul being associated with us.
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:27.482]  They already tried to destroy Paul with Bruno and everything else, it all failed.
[03:13:28.803 --> 03:13:30.524]  This is very sophisticated.
[03:13:30.524 --> 03:13:33.466]  So, he's saying the river is low for the Republicans.
[03:13:33.466 --> 03:13:35.527]  Yeah, but it's even lower for Obama.
[03:13:35.527 --> 03:13:43.831]  And now the Republicans are talking about the New World Order, and global government, and carbon taxes, and home inspections, and national ID cards with all you buy, sell, and do.
[03:13:43.831 --> 03:13:47.413]  LA Times, New York Times today, saying it's good and we need it.
[03:13:47.413 --> 03:13:48.314]  It's happening.
[03:13:48.314 --> 03:13:54.818]  It's total socialized control of your entire life, under a fascist eugenics system.
[03:13:54.818 --> 03:13:54.958]  So,
[03:13:56.129 --> 03:13:58.011]  Again, they're the ones that are low.
[03:13:58.011 --> 03:13:59.452]  They're the ones falling apart.
[03:13:59.452 --> 03:14:02.274]  They're the ones that are stopping and having to breathe.
[03:14:02.274 --> 03:14:04.496]  They're the ones dropping out of the marathon.
[03:14:04.496 --> 03:14:11.122]  We're the ones taking over the Democratic Party and Republican Party with true populism and liberty against their corporate fascism.
[03:14:11.122 --> 03:14:13.544]  Their labels of left and right are see-through.
[03:14:13.544 --> 03:14:16.006]  They got holes in them you can drive a Mack truck through.
[03:14:16.006 --> 03:14:19.569]  Their electronic Berlin Wall is faltering, is shorting out.
[03:14:20.595 --> 03:14:24.360]  And every time you speak the truth and ignore their lies, they get weaker.
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:29.046]  This pathetic guy is just tissue thick.
[03:14:29.046 --> 03:14:33.131]  And so, yeah, all the political parties in the establishment are in crisis.
[03:14:33.131 --> 03:14:34.473]  You're in crisis.
[03:14:34.473 --> 03:14:35.675]  Your riverbed is low.
[03:14:37.799 --> 03:14:43.861]  And so what you see is the real grassroots taking over what's left of the parties, and they are panicked.
[03:14:43.861 --> 03:14:44.881]  Go back to this little guy.
[03:14:56.744 --> 03:14:59.946]  I mean, I assume she will give something of a stutter as an answer.
[03:14:59.946 --> 03:15:01.706]  Here's a, by the way, what are your thoughts, Ken?
[03:15:01.706 --> 03:15:04.448]  I haven't had you on the show lately, so I want to get your DNA here.
[03:15:04.448 --> 03:15:09.850]  You know, they have something called the Minnesota Multifaceted Personality Test, which tests your sort of temperament.
[03:15:09.850 --> 03:15:15.633]  And I remember taking the test to be an RA in grad school, and they ask you questions, but you need, like, tennis or baseball, that kind of thing.
[03:15:15.633 --> 03:15:18.434]  Do you rather play chess, an indoor thing, or go outside, whatever?
[03:15:18.434 --> 03:15:21.496]  And then right in the middle of it, they say things like, is someone chasing you right now?
[03:15:22.416 --> 03:15:24.519]  See, these guys are total control freaks and they can't stand the fact
[03:15:38.277 --> 03:15:39.297]  Look at these full mooners!
[03:15:39.297 --> 03:15:40.118]  They're mentally ill!
[03:15:40.118 --> 03:15:42.378]  The psychological test show!
[03:15:42.378 --> 03:15:44.139]  He just mixes in something about a test.
[03:15:44.139 --> 03:15:45.660]  Oh, it sounds scientific.
[03:15:45.660 --> 03:15:47.000]  They believe the borders are open.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.921]  They believe the government wants their guns.
[03:15:48.921 --> 03:15:50.421]  They believe the banks are looting them.
[03:15:50.421 --> 03:15:52.122]  They believe there's a Bilderberg group.
[03:15:52.122 --> 03:15:57.964]  The Bilderberg's writing op-eds now in major papers calling for world government.
[03:15:57.964 --> 03:16:01.545]  So they're telling the dumbed-down TV watchers, don't listen to people that can read.
[03:16:02.423 --> 03:16:07.609]  Just, just, they're crazy, just stay on the reservation, and they're losing more and more of their minions.
[03:16:07.609 --> 03:16:10.172]  More and more people are going off the plantation.
[03:16:10.172 --> 03:16:13.376]  Oh God, don't listen to them, oh God, oh no!
[03:16:13.376 --> 03:16:15.178]  Finish it up, we're going to Tarpley.
[03:16:15.178 --> 03:16:18.181]  Are we talking psychological problems here with people or what?
[03:16:18.181 --> 03:16:18.662]  Oh, yes.
[03:16:19.022 --> 03:16:19.322]  I don't know.
[03:16:19.322 --> 03:16:23.085]  I mean, there are people who are certainly prone to embrace conspiracy theories.
[03:16:23.085 --> 03:16:26.227]  We see it with the idea that 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:16:26.227 --> 03:16:36.373]  We see it with the idea that the Bilderberg Group meeting every year is in fact a global banking, international banking cabal designed to institute a world government.
[03:16:36.373 --> 03:16:41.256]  And it just so happens that a lot of... Do these guys realize how they're politically destroying themselves?
[03:16:41.256 --> 03:16:44.839]  I mean, do they understand?
[03:16:46.178 --> 03:16:57.262]  That almost everyone now knows about Bilderberg, and it's all over the news, and their own corporate minutes have leaked, and they brag they set up the European Union by covert stealth, and that all of this is real?
[03:16:57.262 --> 03:17:02.024]  He's up... I mean... That's why they're discredited and falling apart!
[03:17:02.024 --> 03:17:04.645]  Because they just keep lying!
[03:17:04.645 --> 03:17:06.246]  They don't even spin!
[03:17:06.246 --> 03:17:06.866]  Go back to it!
[03:17:07.915 --> 03:17:11.196]  The folks who believe those things also believe the rest of them.
[03:17:11.196 --> 03:17:12.976]  And what Howard said is true.
[03:17:12.976 --> 03:17:24.659]  I mean, there are enough of them, particularly in the internet age, where they can be something of a force in politics, and one the Republicans have to watch out for, because they will drag them down into this, you know, sort of marginal path.
[03:17:24.659 --> 03:17:26.020]  And you are great.
[03:17:26.020 --> 03:17:27.060]  And I'm falling in love.
[03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:27.780]  You are great.
[03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:31.001]  You've reminded me of all the erogenous zones of insanity.
[03:17:31.001 --> 03:17:31.321]  Pause.
[03:17:31.321 --> 03:17:31.781]  Hit pause.
[03:17:31.781 --> 03:17:34.102]  I'm going to go to Tarpley, and then we're going to play the rest later.
[03:17:36.128 --> 03:17:44.359]  See, they're afraid of real politics, real ideas breaking through, not this fake left-right thing they've kept us locked in fighting with each other.
[03:17:44.359 --> 03:17:47.763]  And so they say, oh, I hope the Republicans get involved and get dragged in.
[03:17:47.763 --> 03:17:49.465]  They're actually scared to death.
[03:17:50.458 --> 03:17:52.560]  Because all these years they said none of this existed.
[03:17:52.560 --> 03:17:53.962]  Now the public's finding out.
[03:17:53.962 --> 03:18:00.648]  We're on the verge of a revolution, a renaissance, an awakening, an enlightenment of understanding.
[03:18:00.648 --> 03:18:10.238]  Thanks to people like Webster Griffin Tarpley, who said Obama was their man nine months before he was elected, who laid it all out with Brzezinski, laid out all the policies, all the flip-flops,
[03:18:11.627 --> 03:18:15.671]  A man ahead of his time laid out that he would stall within 150 days.
[03:18:15.671 --> 03:18:17.172]  It's now happened.
[03:18:17.172 --> 03:18:19.534]  He said he would have the lowest approval rating ever.
[03:18:19.534 --> 03:18:20.335]  It's happened.
[03:18:20.335 --> 03:18:22.997]  How on earth did you know this, Webster Tarpley?
[03:18:23.902 --> 03:18:25.904]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:18:25.904 --> 03:18:42.822]  I think it was mainly a matter of having lived through the Carter trilateral puppet regime back in 1977 to 81, seeing Zbigniew Brzezinski back then, seeing Paul Adolph Volcker, seeing all the members of the Trilateral Commission who were so prominent in the
[03:18:43.900 --> 03:18:56.125]  In the Carter administration, from Carter and Mondale and Vance and so many others, Blumenthal at the Treasury and so on, they were all handpicked by David Rockefeller and Brzezinski.
[03:18:56.125 --> 03:18:59.347]  This time they did it in a slightly more sophisticated way.
[03:19:00.187 --> 03:19:08.629]  Not so much actual membership in the Trilateral Commission, although we don't really know, but certainly the guiding hand was there.
[03:19:08.629 --> 03:19:20.872]  Now you've got Paul Adolph Holker sitting in the White House and Brzezinski really running a lot of the policy through somebody like Robert Gates, who was his office boy back 30 years ago, who now runs
[03:19:21.593 --> 03:19:22.234]  The Pentagon.
[03:19:22.234 --> 03:19:24.117]  So I think you're dealing with that.
[03:19:24.117 --> 03:19:28.763]  Now, I think the good news, though, is that this has now stalled.
[03:19:28.763 --> 03:19:38.136]  This entire Obama hysteria seems to be disintegrating at a fairly rapid rate and he is now down to 49% in some of these polls.
[03:19:38.456 --> 03:19:44.081]  But a cornered dragon is dangerous with all of his hosts of hell supporting him.
[03:19:44.081 --> 03:19:49.686]  All these powerful interests that are articulating this puppet.
[03:19:49.686 --> 03:19:51.108]  What are their tricks?
[03:19:51.108 --> 03:19:53.870]  Their stage crises, synthetic terror?
[03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:55.852]  You told us what was coming a year and a half ago.
[03:19:55.852 --> 03:19:58.374]  Now tell us what's coming in the next year and a half.
[03:19:58.374 --> 03:19:59.495]  Webster Griffin Tarpon.
[03:19:59.495 --> 03:19:59.996]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.869 --> 03:20:03.890]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[03:20:03.890 --> 03:20:06.832]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[03:20:06.832 --> 03:20:09.073]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[03:20:09.073 --> 03:20:10.054]  Here's the story.
[03:20:10.054 --> 03:20:14.856]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[03:20:14.856 --> 03:20:16.117]  Now here's the bad news.
[03:20:16.117 --> 03:20:19.399]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[03:20:19.659 --> 03:20:19.859]  We're good.
[03:20:35.609 --> 03:20:44.635]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[03:20:44.635 --> 03:20:49.818]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[03:20:49.818 --> 03:20:53.921]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[03:20:53.921 --> 03:20:56.703]  That's makeherbalmedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:21:02.074 --> 03:21:07.880]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:15.468]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:21:15.468 --> 03:21:21.634]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:22.034 --> 03:21:24.015]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:24.015 --> 03:21:26.517]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:26.517 --> 03:21:38.103]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:21:38.103 --> 03:21:39.764]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.764 --> 03:21:41.625]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.625 --> 03:21:47.849]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:56.789 --> 03:21:58.370]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.370 --> 03:21:59.551]  The people strike back!
[03:22:01.508 --> 03:22:08.190]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:08.190 --> 03:22:16.292]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:16.292 --> 03:22:24.134]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:24.474 --> 03:22:29.557]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.557 --> 03:22:34.780]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.780 --> 03:22:39.142]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:39.142 --> 03:22:40.223]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:40.223 --> 03:22:44.245]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.705 --> 03:22:49.610]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:52.613]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:22:54.394 --> 03:22:54.614]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.633 --> 03:23:04.634]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:04.634 --> 03:23:09.977]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:09.977 --> 03:23:12.018]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:12.018 --> 03:23:16.780]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:17.460]  We're good to go.
[03:23:35.009 --> 03:23:35.289]  Good to go!
[03:24:07.284 --> 03:24:34.682]  Alright, let's guitar play.
[03:24:34.682 --> 03:24:36.663]  We were talking during the break.
[03:24:38.815 --> 03:24:45.884]  Obviously he's their manufactured Messiah type that Brzezinski, in between two ages, wrote about in the 70s.
[03:24:45.884 --> 03:24:49.227]  These kind of pop icon presidents they wanted to create.
[03:24:49.227 --> 03:24:50.409]  Kind of little Hitlers.
[03:24:50.409 --> 03:24:55.094]  They're complete puppets, not their own men, as Alos Hitler was.
[03:24:56.912 --> 03:25:01.395]  Now that he's stalling, and much of his agenda, except for the hate crimes bill, they got that.
[03:25:01.395 --> 03:25:04.497]  That was the one thing they wanted to restrict free speech.
[03:25:04.497 --> 03:25:08.999]  Now that they're starting to stall, this is a cornered juggernaut going for broke.
[03:25:08.999 --> 03:25:13.102]  What do you see happening in your political crystal ball?
[03:25:13.914 --> 03:25:18.076]  Well, the first thing is that Obama is now losing some of his core support, right?
[03:25:18.076 --> 03:25:20.137]  He got 52% in the election, allegedly.
[03:25:20.137 --> 03:25:21.198]  He's down to 49.
[03:25:21.198 --> 03:25:27.301]  It means that he's lost 3% of his actual voters, which is, I think, very ominous for him.
[03:25:27.301 --> 03:25:29.642]  Let's just think of where we are.
[03:25:29.642 --> 03:25:33.324]  We're in the first term of Obama, and it's getting to be August.
[03:25:34.131 --> 03:25:40.516]  Uh, where were we about this point in the previous President's first term, say, Bush?
[03:25:40.516 --> 03:25:43.718]  He was on vacation, getting ready to stage a false flag.
[03:25:43.718 --> 03:25:54.106]  Well, having, you know, the rogue network was getting ready to deliver the false flag and hope that he did what they wanted, which he was going to do.
[03:25:54.106 --> 03:25:59.670]  But we're now basically at the point where this 9-11 stuff then comes back into play.
[03:25:59.670 --> 03:26:03.033]  The danger of false flag, I would say, is now rapidly
[03:26:03.774 --> 03:26:04.997]  Increasing.
[03:26:04.997 --> 03:26:08.466]  It has to do with the calculation on the part of these controllers, right?
[03:26:08.466 --> 03:26:10.392]  These trilateral characters.
[03:26:11.232 --> 03:26:14.413]  Do they wish to try to maintain this investment?
[03:26:14.413 --> 03:26:23.637]  I mean, if you look back at Bush, he was already cratering at the point we're at now, and then he was given a huge rally-round effect by 9-11.
[03:26:23.637 --> 03:26:35.943]  And according to Gallup and others, Obama has cratered faster than Bush, faster than Carter, so this is a record, record cratering, and so that brings false flag in.
[03:26:36.661 --> 03:26:37.141]  It does.
[03:26:37.141 --> 03:26:51.674]  And the model, I think, is this character, Andrew Sullivan, writing in the Atlantic Monthly in December of 2007, complained that the use of false flag was momentarily impossible for the Anglo-American ruling class.
[03:26:52.310 --> 03:26:57.393]  Because, under the circumstances of Bush Cheney, nobody would believe them.
[03:26:57.393 --> 03:27:10.620]  In other words, if a bomb went off and Bush Cheney came out and said, country X did it, many people would say, you're lying, many people would say, you're responsible, you're incompetent, or even, you did it yourself as a wag the dog.
[03:27:10.620 --> 03:27:16.543]  So that was the problem that Sullivan saw with the latter years of Bush Cheney.
[03:27:16.543 --> 03:27:21.746]  Now, in the opinion of the ruling elite, I don't think in reality, because I think they're too optimistic,
[03:27:22.395 --> 03:27:28.076]  They would say that Obama could blame another country for something happening and the world would believe it.
[03:27:28.076 --> 03:27:29.676]  Now the list has changed.
[03:27:29.676 --> 03:27:31.757]  This is not going to be Iran anymore.
[03:27:31.757 --> 03:27:39.998]  You will have seen that the CIA faction in Iran is in the streets yelling, death to Russia, death to China, meaning Brzezinski's program.
[03:27:39.998 --> 03:27:50.860]  So there's no point in attacking Iran when you have a chance of taking over the government with Mousavi Rafsanjani and then using Iran against Russia-China, which is what the plan is.
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:54.962]  But I would say... But if that doesn't go well in the next few months, they still may.
[03:27:54.962 --> 03:27:56.543]  I mean, we're getting all these green lights... Possible.
[03:27:56.543 --> 03:27:58.664]  But right now, that's still an open question.
[03:27:58.664 --> 03:28:04.646]  The one thing we do know is that there's bombing of Pakistan every day, which is two and a half times bigger with nuclear weapons.
[03:28:04.646 --> 03:28:07.568]  So I think actually much worse as a policy.
[03:28:07.568 --> 03:28:09.669]  But I think the hit list is now Pakistan,
[03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:14.311]  Well, we already saw the Brzezinski-Geithner crew already manipulating the bushes, as you said, with the 888 probe.
[03:28:31.774 --> 03:28:40.117]  Well, yes, but the question now is that the hit list has changed, and these other countries are now at the top of the list.
[03:28:40.117 --> 03:28:42.198]  So I would say now it's time to redouble vigilance.
[03:28:42.198 --> 03:28:46.040]  In particular, the question of the drills and the exercises.
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:59.165]  What I tried to show in 9-11 Synthetic Terror was that this is done through about 25-plus drills, either happening on the morning of 9-11 or just completed, or in the advanced stages of completion.
[03:28:59.870 --> 03:29:01.331]  And that is how it is done.
[03:29:01.331 --> 03:29:11.136]  I mean, people who have seen the latest Tom Cruise movie, when von Stauffenberg wanted to eliminate Hitler and have a coup d'etat, how did he do it?
[03:29:11.136 --> 03:29:12.357]  He took a pre-existing
[03:29:13.058 --> 03:29:13.919]  Now let's explain...
[03:29:33.215 --> 03:29:35.296]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:35.296 --> 03:29:37.316]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.112 --> 03:30:06.419]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.419 --> 03:30:10.945]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.945 --> 03:30:13.228]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.228 --> 03:30:14.850]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.850 --> 03:30:15.892]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.112 --> 03:30:24.534]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:01.220 --> 03:31:05.462]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:31:05.462 --> 03:31:07.463]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:31:07.463 --> 03:31:15.987]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:31:15.987 --> 03:31:21.550]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:31:21.550 --> 03:31:23.171]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:31:23.391 --> 03:31:29.915]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:31:29.915 --> 03:31:40.963]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:31:40.963 --> 03:31:41.743]  That's right.
[03:31:41.743 --> 03:31:44.305]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:31:44.305 --> 03:31:45.906]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[03:32:01.634 --> 03:32:05.896]  Being a part of Life Change T has been an exhilarating experience.
[03:32:05.896 --> 03:32:07.436]  I love the testimonies.
[03:32:07.436 --> 03:32:10.037]  Julian New York writes, I love this product.
[03:32:10.037 --> 03:32:10.938]  I feel great.
[03:32:10.938 --> 03:32:12.218]  It worked immediately.
[03:32:12.218 --> 03:32:14.199]  You can feel the cleansing right away.
[03:32:14.199 --> 03:32:17.240]  Other products don't work right away like this one does.
[03:32:17.240 --> 03:32:19.001]  Mrs. Luella from Missouri writes,
[03:32:19.381 --> 03:32:21.681]  My daughter has lost 27 pounds.
[03:32:21.681 --> 03:32:23.042]  She loves the tea.
[03:32:23.042 --> 03:32:29.023]  And David from Tennessee writes, My wife has a lot of digestive problems and the tea really helps her a lot.
[03:32:29.023 --> 03:32:30.043]  I like it too.
[03:32:30.043 --> 03:32:32.803]  And here's my favorite from CJ in Minnesota.
[03:32:32.803 --> 03:32:35.144]  He writes, This stuff really works.
[03:32:35.144 --> 03:32:37.104]  No, I mean it really works.
[03:32:37.104 --> 03:32:39.504]  No, I mean it really works.

[03:32:50.548 --> 03:32:50.628]  928-308-0408.
[03:32:50.628 --> 03:32:51.830]  Be our next testimony.
[03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:53.252]  You love us and we love you.
[03:33:18.362 --> 03:33:39.731]  Hi Webster, I was interrupting there with the break, but I want to go over this because we already saw the Bush people and you were saying that was being manipulated already by the Rockefeller arm that was back in full control even before Bush left office with the 888 insanity sneak attacking a Russian-controlled area on record and then hoaxing it and saying the Russians had attacked.
[03:33:39.731 --> 03:33:41.352]  I mean, just insanity.
[03:33:41.352 --> 03:33:42.732]  I'm a political atheist, folks.
[03:33:42.732 --> 03:33:44.173]  We're just reporting the facts here.
[03:33:44.873 --> 03:33:48.234]  And of course, that later came out, but the hoax worked for a week.
[03:33:48.234 --> 03:33:51.735]  Some of the listeners thought that I was lying and that Russia had snuck attack.
[03:33:51.735 --> 03:33:55.036]  I mean, this is getting insane.
[03:33:55.036 --> 03:33:57.097]  So what else do you see Obama doing?
[03:33:57.097 --> 03:33:58.297]  I don't just see wars.
[03:33:58.297 --> 03:34:06.420]  I mean, could they... I see them tarpley, scripting for right-wing militias, gun owners, anti-Obamas.
[03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:09.701]  I see the programming by the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center,
[03:34:10.521 --> 03:34:13.883]  To stage something, that the government's going to stage something.
[03:34:13.883 --> 03:34:19.486]  I see the prescripting, before it was Bin Laden prescripting, before 9-11 and I saw that.
[03:34:19.486 --> 03:34:24.628]  I see prescripting for them to go the domestic terror route with white Al Qaeda.
[03:34:24.628 --> 03:34:25.809]  Do you see that in the cards?
[03:34:28.130 --> 03:34:37.196]  That helps the dictatorial agenda domestically, and it gets you back to McVeigh and the whole universe of the 1990s.
[03:34:37.196 --> 03:34:44.580]  That, indeed, in the 1990s under Clinton, that was the main form, for example, of British intelligence in the United States.
[03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:45.701]  We're up to their necks.
[03:34:46.421 --> 03:34:51.024]  In white supremacists and all kinds of militias.
[03:34:51.024 --> 03:34:52.365]  So is German intel.
[03:34:52.365 --> 03:34:58.388]  It came out German intelligence on loan to the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center was running the groups.
[03:34:58.388 --> 03:35:00.450]  The BND, yes, right.
[03:35:00.450 --> 03:35:01.891]  But here's the problem with that.
[03:35:01.891 --> 03:35:06.533]  That doesn't advance your international agenda as much as you want.
[03:35:06.533 --> 03:35:07.974]  As a matter of fact, it hurts it.
[03:35:07.974 --> 03:35:15.519]  Because if you have... If Obama is no longer the smiling peace angel bringing singing tomorrows to the United States, but rather some kind of a stern
[03:35:16.179 --> 03:35:20.341]  A dictator who's, you know, shooting at crowds or something.
[03:35:20.341 --> 03:35:24.443]  Then you get into diminishing returns.
[03:35:24.443 --> 03:35:31.326]  And remember, the main thrust of this has got to be, when it comes to false flags, that you want to be able to blame it on somebody.
[03:35:31.326 --> 03:35:32.046]  You want to somehow
[03:35:32.805 --> 03:35:37.008]  Create, for example, a conflict among other nations.
[03:35:37.008 --> 03:35:38.850]  Not necessarily the U.S.
[03:35:38.850 --> 03:35:40.611]  that goes on the attack.
[03:35:40.611 --> 03:35:44.294]  The neocon response to every crisis is bomb them.
[03:35:44.294 --> 03:35:47.457]  With Obama and Brzezinski, the idea is you're too weak.
[03:35:47.457 --> 03:35:48.438]  You're too weak to do that.
[03:35:48.438 --> 03:35:49.238]  You're too isolated.
[03:35:49.238 --> 03:35:49.839]  You're too hated.
[03:35:49.839 --> 03:35:50.900]  You're too bankrupt.
[03:35:50.900 --> 03:35:53.642]  Your military is overstretched at the breaking point.
[03:35:53.642 --> 03:36:01.048]  Therefore, what you're looking at is questions like, you know, the playing of Ethiopia against Somalia was a small example.
[03:36:01.848 --> 03:36:04.811]  The playing of enemy states, one against the other.
[03:36:04.811 --> 03:36:16.341]  Just in another recent case, in Urumqi, right in northwest China, we had this murder spree by the inhabitants of Chinese Turkestan, who are basically Turks.
[03:36:16.341 --> 03:36:19.323]  This led them to the killing of a whole bunch of Chinese.
[03:36:19.323 --> 03:36:23.387]  This was run here by, according to the Chinese government, and I think they're right,
[03:36:23.968 --> 03:36:31.762]  Rabia Qadir, K-A-D-E-R, coming out of Fairfax, Virginia, working with money from various U.S.
[03:36:31.762 --> 03:36:32.664]  government agencies.
[03:36:33.303 --> 03:36:37.926]  Had been, you know, fomenting this stuff, according to the Chinese government.
[03:36:37.926 --> 03:36:51.174]  Now, the fact that the Chinese have cracked down in Northwest China has led to a crisis in diplomatic relations between China on the one hand, and Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran on the other.
[03:36:51.174 --> 03:36:56.237]  It's causing trouble for the Chinese, not only domestically, but also in their international affairs.
[03:36:56.237 --> 03:37:00.340]  And that's exactly what Brzezinski says in the grand chess board in his last book.
[03:37:00.340 --> 03:37:01.701]  But expanding on that,
[03:37:02.763 --> 03:37:29.692]  uh... every time they use the muslim extremist against the serbs they use the muslim extremist against uh... mama knows that i can i ran they're using the muslim extremists and i ran the shiites against the uh... the sunni against the shiites they're using the muslim extremist in the united states is the pretext to take our liberties they're using the muslim extremist uh... with the president of pakistan saying what do you mean i'm behind the taliban they work for you menacing us i mean when is the public gonna figure out
[03:37:31.772 --> 03:37:36.653]  It's like those TV infomercials for the magic tool that does a hundred things.
[03:37:36.653 --> 03:37:44.636]  Is Wahhabist, especially Wahhabist Muslim variant, are they not the Swiss army knife Leatherman tool of the New World Order?
[03:37:44.636 --> 03:37:58.219]  Because in every case they are the ones and is that because they're so cultic that the low-level people don't even know they're being handled by higher-level Muslims that are just Western intelligence operatives being highly paid.
[03:37:58.219 --> 03:38:00.380]  I mean is this the organic
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:11.786]  Our cultural perfect Manchurian candidate is the Muslim extremist because they're always the people, wherever the New World Order is, their vanguard is screaming turbot heads.
[03:38:11.786 --> 03:38:17.129]  Well, I think that is not able to capture what actually goes on.
[03:38:17.129 --> 03:38:19.270]  Remember, you can do this anywhere.
[03:38:19.270 --> 03:38:24.273]  In other words, you can generate patsies out of any culture under the right circumstances.
[03:38:24.273 --> 03:38:27.615]  No, no, I agree, but I'm saying over and over again they keep using Muslims.
[03:38:28.029 --> 03:38:32.133]  But this involves the targeting, and the targeting is for many reasons.
[03:38:32.133 --> 03:38:37.558]  It's because the Arab and Islamic countries tend to occupy so much of the world's oil.
[03:38:37.558 --> 03:38:43.323]  The Middle East is this area of conflict among any number of major powers.
[03:38:43.823 --> 03:38:51.371]  There's also the fact that the British have been in command of India with a very large Muslim population for all of those centuries.
[03:38:51.371 --> 03:38:55.215]  They have refined their techniques of brainwashing and manipulation.
[03:38:55.215 --> 03:39:02.062]  In other words, Wahhabism, what is today called Wahhabism, is something that comes out of British India in the 1700s.
[03:39:02.062 --> 03:39:04.425]  Yeah, it's a British intel development.
[03:39:04.425 --> 03:39:05.286]  Tell folks about that.
[03:39:06.886 --> 03:39:07.146]  I don't know.
[03:39:26.721 --> 03:39:28.222]  This is the real you.
[03:39:28.222 --> 03:39:30.423]  This is your real cultural identity.
[03:39:30.423 --> 03:39:32.063]  This is who you really are.
[03:39:32.063 --> 03:39:45.869]  So, they'll say to the Muslims, your identity is not this great Baghdad renaissance of Harun al-Rashid with some of the greatest scientific advances and Ibn Sina and Al-Farabi and so forth.
[03:39:45.869 --> 03:39:47.010]  They'll say, that's not you.
[03:39:47.010 --> 03:39:51.571]  You are rather al-Ghazali and his destruction of the destruction.
[03:39:51.571 --> 03:39:55.053]  In other words, you're going to be a Sufi mystic, not a Baghdad
[03:39:55.553 --> 03:39:59.234]  Science scholar of 800 or 900 AD.
[03:39:59.234 --> 03:40:02.475]  So, they then build on that.
[03:40:02.475 --> 03:40:08.417]  It's also the fact that these areas right now are very poor, and they've got a large young population.
[03:40:08.417 --> 03:40:14.459]  In other words, there's a very large majority of the population in a lot of these places that's below 30 years old.
[03:40:14.459 --> 03:40:21.622]  A lot of them are peasants who have been coming into cities, and that always creates a lot of friction and a lot of potential for
[03:40:22.422 --> 03:40:29.167]  Yeah, there's population explosion pressures, and what you're saying is, you misunderstood, is exactly what I'm saying.
[03:40:29.167 --> 03:40:43.398]  They're taking the culture, warping it, creating a... It's the same thing with Pol Pot, that Brzezinski brags about, how, yeah, I used Pol Pot, I picked him, we built him up, he killed 30% of the population, that stopped the communists.
[03:40:43.398 --> 03:40:45.700]  But then in another level, they were also funding the communists.
[03:40:46.600 --> 03:41:08.725]  Anything to destabilize would you agree then they use that same culture type manipulation with with the Khmer Rouge saying we're going back to the rural society just like they say your Muslim culture is a Bedouin society kill the Westerner then they use them as a menacing pawn to set up their police states domestically and have a pretext to invade the Middle East.
[03:41:09.315 --> 03:41:09.975]  Yeah, certainly.
[03:41:09.975 --> 03:41:19.817]  And Al-Qaeda, if you look at what they preach, it's the idea that there has to be a caliphate, meaning that all the existing governments are illegitimate.
[03:41:19.817 --> 03:41:31.340]  So that means that if you want to overthrow any of these governments, from Saudi Arabia to Egypt or whoever it is, according to bin Laden, really a troupe of actors, all of those places are illegitimate.
[03:41:31.340 --> 03:41:34.261]  And at the same time, you've got to be backward.
[03:41:34.261 --> 03:41:37.282]  And at the same time, you can't make alliances with anybody else.
[03:41:37.282 --> 03:41:38.642]  You can't ally with
[03:41:39.202 --> 03:41:43.268]  Japan, or Russia, or China, or Brazil, or South Africa.
[03:41:43.268 --> 03:41:48.736]  You're not allowed to do any of that because... Key, make them rigid so that they're now isolated.
[03:41:49.923 --> 03:41:50.544]  Yeah, in effect.
[03:41:50.544 --> 03:42:14.064]  So, let's look now at the way in which this might be applied, and here it takes some scenario spinning, but in order to get something going at the level that they would like for the needs of now, and now is not then, now is not how do you bomb Iran, that's useless, you can do that any time you want, but it's got to be now, and I think this is why this coup attempt in Iran is so interesting.
[03:42:14.781 --> 03:42:16.342]  Here we have the Green Revolution.
[03:42:16.342 --> 03:42:22.267]  We have Mousavi, who was the Prime Minister during the Iran-Iraq War.
[03:42:22.267 --> 03:42:27.030]  The Iran-Iraq War is a good example of, frankly, of Brzezinski's method.
[03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:32.614]  And it started under Brzezinski, for God's sake, or very soon after he left office.
[03:42:32.614 --> 03:42:35.716]  So you encourage Iraq to attack Iran.
[03:42:35.716 --> 03:42:38.759]  Part of that being to tie them both up, to destroy them both.
[03:42:38.759 --> 03:42:43.142]  You're also interested in consolidating Khomeini in Iran when he's showing signs of
[03:42:43.622 --> 03:42:44.183]  We're good to go.
[03:43:05.365 --> 03:43:06.647]  And they would just get mowed down.
[03:43:06.647 --> 03:43:12.393]  There was, of course, this famous fountain of blood in Tehran to memorialize these martyrs.
[03:43:12.393 --> 03:43:13.334]  That's Mousavi.
[03:43:13.334 --> 03:43:16.857]  Now, that's the Anglo-American candidate of today.
[03:43:16.857 --> 03:43:19.500]  So he's perfect because he kills Persians.
[03:43:19.500 --> 03:43:20.661]  It's another eugenical...
[03:43:21.462 --> 03:43:22.223]  We've been retooled.
[03:43:22.223 --> 03:43:28.551]  I mean, what he talks about now is internet freedom, that there's got to be internet freedom, and more privatization.
[03:43:28.551 --> 03:43:31.535]  So he wants the full IMF shock therapy.
[03:43:31.535 --> 03:43:34.358]  Foreign banks coming in, inoculations for everybody.
[03:43:36.721 --> 03:43:45.484]  I want to finish up with Iran, but the time we've got with you, I want to look back domestically because we're now seeing the Obama squads try to get people kicked off the radio.
[03:43:45.484 --> 03:43:47.605]  We're now seeing them go after sponsors.
[03:43:47.605 --> 03:43:50.426]  We're now seeing them say it's illegal to criticize them.
[03:43:50.426 --> 03:43:55.028]  Any criticism of healthcare takeover, anything is racism.
[03:43:55.028 --> 03:43:58.029]  I want to get your take on the healthcare takeover, the carbon tax.
[03:43:58.029 --> 03:44:01.270]  I want to run through a few bullet points with you and some other stories, but go ahead.
[03:44:01.974 --> 03:44:08.219]  Well, let me just say, one of the things that has got this going is this birth certificate issue, and I would simply say this.
[03:44:08.219 --> 03:44:14.505]  There's such a thing as the long-form, vault-copy birth certificate, the original.
[03:44:14.505 --> 03:44:21.270]  And original means, 1961 original, means with things typed in... Yeah, not a receipt.
[03:44:21.270 --> 03:44:22.451]  Not a receipt.
[03:44:22.451 --> 03:44:23.292]  Not a receipt.
[03:44:23.292 --> 03:44:27.556]  Not something that... I mean, you heard Matthews, I asked you during the break, what do you think of him panicking?
[03:44:28.459 --> 03:44:40.124]  Well, I think that there is a hysteria in the Obama-Kool-Aid cultists, and within the world of these lemmings, the Chris Matthews and others, there is a genuine hysteria about this.
[03:44:40.124 --> 03:44:46.867]  And what it encapsulates, along with some other incidents that have happened lately, is their class hatred.
[03:44:46.867 --> 03:44:54.091]  In other words, it's an elitist hatred by these foundation-funded intellectuals and media types against
[03:44:54.571 --> 03:44:55.873]  Yeah, they're afraid of independent
[03:45:09.668 --> 03:45:13.111]  Farmers, autoworkers, black, white, they don't care.
[03:45:13.111 --> 03:45:25.580]  If you're a real man with a real family and normal, they don't like it because they're the parasite economy that openly is waging... I mean, I was looking at the global warming funding and it's all Goldman Sachs, all JP Morgan.
[03:45:25.580 --> 03:45:30.684]  Like you said, and it's in the new film coming up, they literally are waging war against reality.
[03:45:32.285 --> 03:45:41.991]  And the obvious tendency of a regime like Obama is to collapse into a kind of Carter catastrophic abortive interlude.
[03:45:41.991 --> 03:45:44.072]  In other words, a one-term presidency.
[03:45:44.884 --> 03:45:49.068]  So we'll go out of a fake left wing into a kind of false libertarian corporate looting?
[03:46:05.283 --> 03:46:13.146]  Yes, with Mitt Romney, I think, is the face of what is likely to prevail inside the current Republican Party.
[03:46:13.146 --> 03:46:16.027]  When it comes to these policies, cap and trade is very easy.
[03:46:16.027 --> 03:46:21.409]  Cap and trade is simply no, no, no, no, no, and stop this completely.
[03:46:21.409 --> 03:46:31.293]  When you get to healthcare, you've obviously got Obama having really identified or revealed a genocidal mentality.
[03:46:31.293 --> 03:46:33.934]  In a sense, he talks about his mother's hip operation.
[03:46:34.634 --> 03:46:38.297]  That she had been ill with cancer but had a hip operation.
[03:46:38.297 --> 03:46:41.600]  And Obama says that this was an ethical dilemma for him.
[03:46:41.600 --> 03:46:44.342]  Whether his sick mother should get a hip operation.
[03:46:45.425 --> 03:46:56.611]  This is the guy who shovels trillions of dollars, 24 trillion so far, across the room for AIG and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and Citibank and the rest of these bandits.
[03:46:56.611 --> 03:47:00.653]  Obama, he sounds more and more like the president of the Hemlock Society.
[03:47:00.653 --> 03:47:03.715]  He talks about hospices, how much he likes hospices.
[03:47:03.715 --> 03:47:08.357]  These are places where you go and they give you a drug cocktail and that's pretty much the end of you.
[03:47:08.357 --> 03:47:10.178]  Well, that's what I was going to say, Webster.
[03:47:11.451 --> 03:47:17.734]  They keep saying this isn't government controlled, but then a lot of doctors are saying it is eugenics.
[03:47:17.734 --> 03:47:22.957]  They're now saying we're going to have an ID card that has what we eat, what we do on it.
[03:47:22.957 --> 03:47:23.637]  No, I'm not kidding.
[03:47:23.637 --> 03:47:31.761]  This is LA Times proposing it, and that the bureaucrats will decide if you've lived your life right and if you get health care.
[03:47:32.981 --> 03:47:36.802]  I mean, and then they admit this is to lower the carbon footprint.
[03:47:36.802 --> 03:47:40.804]  I have mainstream articles saying it's good for old people to die.
[03:47:40.804 --> 03:47:43.524]  And Daschle, I have his book.
[03:47:43.524 --> 03:47:46.385]  He says, if you're above 60, no eye surgery.
[03:47:46.385 --> 03:47:56.728]  And then I have video of Tony Blair when he was asked in the comments, hey, you got to wait 18 months for a brain surgery that's inoperable after six months, but is 90% operable if you do it in the first two.
[03:47:56.728 --> 03:47:58.489]  And he said, yeah, you don't need to have that.
[03:47:58.489 --> 03:47:59.729]  You need to die.
[03:47:59.729 --> 03:48:01.910]  It's not some Republican propaganda.
[03:48:02.310 --> 03:48:03.631]  To say this is eugenics?
[03:48:03.631 --> 03:48:05.392]  This is really happening!
[03:48:05.392 --> 03:48:06.193]  It clearly is.
[03:48:06.193 --> 03:48:07.394]  Now here's the problem.
[03:48:07.394 --> 03:48:14.799]  You do have 50 million people who have no insurance and you have about 18,000 who die a year because they don't get healthcare.
[03:48:14.799 --> 03:48:31.571]  But just in terms of Obama, as long as you've got ORSAC up there, the director of the OMB, ORSAC is the guy who tells you that you should not have an MRI, you should not have a CAT scan, you should not have a nuclear stress test, you shouldn't have a PSA or whatever it is.
[03:48:32.171 --> 03:48:37.837]  This is obviously also a genocidal sort of bean-counting, pointy-headed bureaucrat mentality.
[03:48:37.837 --> 03:48:40.981]  And then the other one is Haldren, and this is really, I think, very dramatic.
[03:48:40.981 --> 03:48:44.064]  Oh, that's what I meant to get you on about originally.
[03:48:44.064 --> 03:48:45.185]  Webster, stop.
[03:48:45.185 --> 03:48:45.786]  Exactly.
[03:48:45.786 --> 03:48:51.592]  In fact, when the crews come and interview you again, final interview for the film, I've done 17 now with other people.
[03:48:52.894 --> 03:49:04.343]  Holdren comes out with a textbook about forced abortion, forced sterilization, putting stuff in the water, CPS to take all kids, to raise them in government, hive buildings.
[03:49:04.343 --> 03:49:08.407]  I mean, actually everything in one document we already knew.
[03:49:08.407 --> 03:49:09.828]  Tell me about that.
[03:49:09.828 --> 03:49:15.373]  Well, I've got his book, Ecoscience, and it's co-authored with Paul Ehrlich.
[03:49:15.373 --> 03:49:19.917]  Paul Ehrlich was the professor at Stanford University, an absolute crackpot and charlatan.
[03:49:20.552 --> 03:49:30.615]  His most famous book is The Population Bomb, and he was talking about a worldwide population explosion, and now here we are 35, 40 years later, there has been no such thing.
[03:49:30.615 --> 03:49:34.856]  As a matter of fact, the population in many parts of the world is falling.
[03:49:34.856 --> 03:49:38.177]  Certainly in the European Union, it's falling.
[03:49:38.177 --> 03:49:39.778]  In Japan, it's falling.
[03:49:39.778 --> 03:49:43.219]  In the U.S., it would be falling if it weren't for immigration.
[03:49:44.207 --> 03:49:45.389]  This is, this is Holdren.
[03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:50.256]  He's basically a partner of the discredited crackpot, uh, Paul Ehrlich.
[03:49:50.256 --> 03:49:52.579]  And indeed, that's what they write about.
[03:49:52.579 --> 03:49:57.767]  Coercive, involuntary measures to prevent population growth through
[03:49:58.470 --> 03:50:03.933]  Get into the area of compulsory sterilization, limits on families, special taxes.
[03:50:03.933 --> 03:50:09.035]  In other words, it's a liberal totalitarian nightmare that they write about.
[03:50:09.035 --> 03:50:15.658]  It's a control freak orgy of just absolute pin-headed vampirism.
[03:50:15.658 --> 03:50:18.880]  And I declare eternal war against these people.
[03:50:18.880 --> 03:50:19.560]  Yeah, sure.
[03:50:19.560 --> 03:50:20.180]  And that's clear.
[03:50:20.180 --> 03:50:23.902]  In other words, you can't have a health program created by these people.
[03:50:23.902 --> 03:50:25.323]  However, let me hurry to stress.
[03:50:26.027 --> 03:50:29.089]  The reactionary Republican agenda is also fairly clear.
[03:50:29.089 --> 03:50:32.552]  They would like to destroy Medicare, destroy Social Security.
[03:50:32.552 --> 03:50:34.573]  It's another form of eugenics.
[03:50:34.573 --> 03:50:37.455]  It's a way where you die and it's in the name of the market.
[03:50:37.455 --> 03:50:41.218]  In other words, the Democrats come after you with a board that tells you you have to die.
[03:50:41.218 --> 03:50:45.521]  With the Republicans, you die because the free market says you don't get any health care.
[03:50:45.521 --> 03:50:46.922]  Yeah, you die out on the street.
[03:50:46.922 --> 03:50:54.347]  But the problem is the state is so eugenics run that any government system, if we were angels and gave people health care,
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:58.942]  The establishment would seize it up and use it as a weapon to start stabbing us.
[03:50:58.942 --> 03:51:03.885]  So, it's just damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[03:51:03.885 --> 03:51:08.388]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[03:51:08.388 --> 03:51:11.750]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:16.613]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.

[03:51:21.776 --> 03:51:33.631]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[03:51:33.631 --> 03:51:36.455]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.

[03:51:51.900 --> 03:51:52.660]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[03:51:52.660 --> 03:51:53.380]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:51:53.380 --> 03:51:55.101]  It is a big idea.
[03:51:55.101 --> 03:51:55.761]  A new world order.
[03:52:05.979 --> 03:52:10.881]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:52:10.881 --> 03:52:13.701]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:13.701 --> 03:52:16.482]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:52:16.482 --> 03:52:19.663]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:19.663 --> 03:52:26.985]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:30.011 --> 03:52:35.455]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:35.455 --> 03:52:39.337]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:39.337 --> 03:52:41.899]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:52:41.899 --> 03:52:43.060]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:43.060 --> 03:52:43.860]  They're not after money.
[03:52:43.860 --> 03:52:45.121]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:45.121 --> 03:52:46.102]  They're after power.
[03:52:46.102 --> 03:52:47.263]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:52:47.263 --> 03:52:55.928]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:55.928 --> 03:52:58.790]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:59.871]  You have been warned.
[03:52:59.991 --> 03:53:01.471]  Yeah.
[03:53:01.471 --> 03:53:06.973]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[03:53:06.973 --> 03:53:07.753]  and the world.
[03:53:07.753 --> 03:53:11.614]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[03:53:11.614 --> 03:53:18.115]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:53:18.115 --> 03:53:20.156]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[03:53:20.156 --> 03:53:25.377]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[03:53:25.697 --> 03:53:25.897]  I'm good.
[03:53:41.056 --> 03:53:41.396]  I think so.
[03:54:04.215 --> 03:54:06.637]  We're coming straight on to the New World Order.
[03:54:06.637 --> 03:54:09.000]  Webster said we have a lot of listeners in Germany.
[03:54:09.000 --> 03:54:11.682]  He was telling me that the show is really having an effect.
[03:54:11.682 --> 03:54:13.504]  So is Webster, all of us together.
[03:54:13.504 --> 03:54:21.611]  His newest book is Surviving the Cataclysm, a compendium of the globalist activity, their banking, what they're doing, how to protect yourself.
[03:54:22.532 --> 03:54:23.695]  This is a great book.
[03:54:23.695 --> 03:54:25.137]  We just got it in the bookstore.
[03:54:25.137 --> 03:54:26.420]  It just came out.
[03:54:26.420 --> 03:54:30.748]  Surviving the Cataclysm, available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:54:30.748 --> 03:54:30.908]  Webster!
[03:54:35.003 --> 03:54:40.125]  We ordered three copies of Eco Science, none of them came.
[03:54:40.125 --> 03:54:41.986]  It all sold out, they returned our money.
[03:54:41.986 --> 03:54:55.771]  But, I got to a university, was able to print off a e-version, but you went to the library, you were telling me, got the actual textbook, and you were saying during the break, this is the Rosetta Stone, the compendium of all their sickening eugenics.
[03:54:55.771 --> 03:55:00.113]  Break that down for folks, what we're facing under the scientific dictatorship.
[03:55:00.492 --> 03:55:09.234]  Well, this is now John Holdren, who is the official White House science advisor to Obama, special assistant to the president for science policy.
[03:55:09.234 --> 03:55:13.434]  That's the office in the new executive office building.
[03:55:13.434 --> 03:55:16.595]  This person is, frankly, a genocidalist.
[03:55:16.595 --> 03:55:22.196]  He is an extreme Malthusian, and the book in question is a large textbook.
[03:55:22.196 --> 03:55:26.797]  It's more than a thousand pages, and it's co-written by Holdren.
[03:55:27.344 --> 03:55:34.951]  With Paul Ehrlich, now Paul Ehrlich, E-H-R-L-I-C-H, this was a professor at Stanford University.
[03:55:34.951 --> 03:55:46.441]  The most famous book that he wrote was called The Population Bomb, meaning that there was going to be this huge increase in world population, that this would become unsustainable and world civilization would collapse into chaos.
[03:55:47.142 --> 03:55:48.544]  This is simply baloney.
[03:55:48.544 --> 03:55:51.126]  The guy's a crackpot and a charlatan.
[03:55:51.126 --> 03:55:53.849]  There never was a population explosion.
[03:55:53.849 --> 03:56:00.155]  Right now, population rates in Europe, Japan, and other parts of the world are going negative.
[03:56:00.155 --> 03:56:00.616]  It's 1.2, 1.3.
[03:56:00.616 --> 03:56:08.404]  So for every two parents having 1.3 kids, it's the complete death of advanced Western cultures.
[03:56:08.704 --> 03:56:09.404]  And in Russia.
[03:56:09.404 --> 03:56:13.526]  So many key parts of the world are actually in negative population growth now.
[03:56:13.526 --> 03:56:15.347]  This is what they wanted.
[03:56:15.347 --> 03:56:19.629]  So Holdren writes it with Ehrlich and Ehrlich's wife.
[03:56:19.629 --> 03:56:22.450]  So it's a textbook and it has everything in it.
[03:56:22.450 --> 03:56:29.914]  It's their view on production, technology, agriculture, population, demographics, the entire thing.
[03:56:30.678 --> 03:56:34.040]  And it's all signed by this guy, Haldren, who's now in the White House.
[03:56:34.040 --> 03:56:43.385]  And what we have is compulsory sterilization, compulsory vasectomies, forced sterilization, limits on families.
[03:56:43.385 --> 03:56:50.128]  And again, all of this with the idea that zero population growth, ZPG, as they call it in the book.
[03:56:50.128 --> 03:56:54.471]  Binary chemicals in food and water, so the elites don't get it, but we do.
[03:56:55.191 --> 03:56:59.052]  Sticking all kinds of substances in food and water.
[03:56:59.052 --> 03:57:01.033]  Again, vasectomies are good.
[03:57:01.033 --> 03:57:05.735]  Sterilizing women is good, but it's more complicated and costs more.
[03:57:05.735 --> 03:57:07.236]  All kinds of police state measures.
[03:57:07.236 --> 03:57:15.018]  They actually have a table of all the different things you can do and how effective they're going to be and how totalitarian and dictatorial they are.
[03:57:15.018 --> 03:57:24.142]  I think this person is a huge target for public resentment and indeed public political education to understand what this is because this is putting
[03:57:24.981 --> 03:57:34.168]  He's a true fanatic, a true charlatan, crackpot fanatic, supporter of what amounts to genocide, because that is what it means when you start lowering the population.
[03:57:34.168 --> 03:57:37.231]  But is this not just a window into the main agenda?
[03:57:37.231 --> 03:57:40.413]  Because, Webster, you know we're on the same page in Endgame.
[03:57:40.413 --> 03:57:43.976]  I make the point every time I kick open the final door, it's eugenics.
[03:57:43.976 --> 03:57:45.998]  I mean, that's these guys' religion.
[03:57:45.998 --> 03:57:49.120]  And a lot of other top scientists and professors are now saying the same thing.
[03:57:49.120 --> 03:57:53.864]  In fact, it was in the British news and Canadian news today that people, I think, are starting to get this.
[03:57:54.833 --> 03:58:01.320]  I would say eugenics is one of the foundations of their ideology in the sense that they're an oligarchy.
[03:58:01.320 --> 03:58:08.047]  They need a way to define the majority of humankind as vestular subhuman, and indeed that's what they do.
[03:58:08.047 --> 03:58:15.335]  So therefore, they are the elite, but you are a candidate for eugenics and population reduction.
[03:58:15.515 --> 03:58:17.176]  Yeah, folks, this isn't a game, it's happening.
[03:58:17.176 --> 03:58:22.538]  Get the book, Surviving the Cataclysm, at InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:58:22.538 --> 03:58:26.000]  And get the Obama Deception that Webster Tarpley's in.
[03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:29.341]  Webster, I want to have you back up next week for a full hour to take calls.
[03:58:29.341 --> 03:58:30.101]  Great job.
[03:58:30.101 --> 03:58:31.842]  Let me say bye to you at the end of the show right now.
[03:58:31.842 --> 03:58:32.442]  Thank you.
[03:58:32.442 --> 03:58:33.363]  Key info.
[03:58:33.363 --> 03:58:34.243]  Thank you, Webster.
