[00:00.000 --> 00:17.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, President Trump is holding a coronavirus briefing right
[00:17.760 --> 00:18.760]  now.
[00:18.760 --> 00:22.040]  We are tracking exactly what he's saying and doing in the next segment.
[00:22.040 --> 00:25.400]  We'll have some next serves of that or may go live.
[00:25.400 --> 00:33.440]  Today is Tuesday, March 17, 2020, and I am in a small Texas town where I was going to
[00:33.440 --> 00:37.560]  spend a few days with my children.
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.240]  And I've obviously been working the whole time because the crisis has deepened.
[00:42.240 --> 00:49.720]  And when I was on the edge of town today, they had 10 police cars, mobile command centers
[00:49.720 --> 00:53.640]  and RVs.
[00:53.640 --> 00:55.680]  And of course, it's very clear what that's for.
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.360]  They're preparing to lock down the town that I am in.
[01:00.360 --> 01:04.040]  So I was going to be coming back tomorrow.
[01:04.040 --> 01:09.280]  I am now going to be coming back today because the shutdown of the interstate highways, the
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.960]  shutdown of transportation is imminent.
[01:13.960 --> 01:14.960]  Is imminent.
[01:14.960 --> 01:17.920]  We've confirmed that Trump's been discussing it, came out in the news that day after we
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.520]  told you about that.
[01:20.520 --> 01:22.800]  This is just insane.
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.200]  And remember, the southern border is still unsecured and wide open, and the Democrats
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.160]  say no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.240]  Europe is being hammered by Turkey trying to send in millions of military aged men holding
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.600]  children over fire so they cry and then running through the troops with them.
[01:37.600 --> 01:38.800]  That is ongoing.
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.480]  Attack boats funded by Soros are just slamming in by the minute, literally hundreds of boats
[01:43.480 --> 01:44.480]  a day.
[01:44.480 --> 01:46.440]  They're just attacking, attacking, attacking.
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.520]  And the left's just embracing them, embracing them, embracing them while saying we've got
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.120]  to lock your cities down.
[01:52.120 --> 01:54.320]  We've got to lock your towns down.
[01:54.320 --> 01:56.920]  We've got to forcibly inoculate you.
[01:56.920 --> 01:58.480]  We've got to take your guns.
[01:58.480 --> 02:02.640]  And now it's not just Illinois, it's Louisiana.
[02:02.640 --> 02:03.640]  It's California.
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.640]  It's New York.
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.160]  They're all announcing you cannot own guns, you cannot transport guns, you cannot buy
[02:09.160 --> 02:10.160]  guns.
[02:10.160 --> 02:12.280]  We're just coming after your guns.
[02:12.280 --> 02:13.280]  It's totally insane.
[02:13.280 --> 02:17.560]  Yes, some towns are saying we're going to come for your guns now.
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.440]  The New Orleans mayor is power grabbing saying you cannot buy guns, you cannot transport
[02:22.440 --> 02:24.480]  guns, you cannot have a gun in your car.
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.360]  That will obviously spread the looting and insanity during a lockdown.
[02:28.360 --> 02:31.280]  A lockdown is martial law.
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.280]  And martial law a lot of times tends to trigger a breakdown of society.
[02:36.280 --> 02:38.920]  It tends to actually create lawlessness.
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.640]  And so when the police are busy shutting down the roads, all the criminals then start robbing
[02:43.640 --> 02:45.920]  the houses and going around other ways.
[02:45.920 --> 02:48.080]  So this is a takedown of civilization.
[02:48.080 --> 02:50.360]  It is a total weapon against America.
[02:50.360 --> 02:53.560]  It was launched because we beat the chai comms and the globalists.
[02:53.560 --> 02:55.800]  And they said, you haven't defeated us.
[02:55.800 --> 02:58.160]  No, no, no.
[02:58.160 --> 02:59.160]  You will die.
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.240]  The quote from Palpatine.
[03:01.240 --> 03:04.440]  And it's lightning bolts, okay?
[03:04.440 --> 03:06.880]  It's one button.
[03:06.880 --> 03:09.480]  Release the bio weapon that's manmade.
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.280]  Release the bio weapon that comes back that has the HIV delivery system.
[03:13.280 --> 03:16.000]  And here's the other shocking news.
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.960]  I got in my Rolodex yesterday and I said, let me just call, try to be 12 different nurses
[03:22.960 --> 03:23.960]  that I know.
[03:23.960 --> 03:26.640]  I was able to get ahold of eight of them.
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.720]  And they all said at their hospitals, there are people that are fighting for their lives
[03:31.720 --> 03:39.320]  that are mainly 45 to 55 and that are super healthy actually and are in shape.
[03:39.320 --> 03:45.520]  One guy in Dallas came back from Switzerland on a ski trip, he's been in there over a week
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.760]  and a half fighting for his life in a semi-comatose state right now.
[03:50.760 --> 03:55.920]  And they said it is incredibly painful and they said it is not like the flu.
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.960]  And so that adds to a lot of folks that are saying this is really deadly.
[04:00.960 --> 04:04.560]  Regardless it's manmade and the globalists are behind it and they are behind the hype
[04:04.560 --> 04:09.600]  so people better be concerned but they are shutting down beaches, they are shutting
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.760]  down everything, they are coming for the guns, they are shutting down towns, they are shutting
[04:13.760 --> 04:16.280]  down everything.
[04:16.280 --> 04:19.360]  And now Trump has said this may cause a recession.
[04:19.360 --> 04:22.240]  So Trump is capitulating to the hysteria.
[04:22.240 --> 04:27.160]  I get why he tried to stall it and not let it be an economic weapon against us because
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.520]  any way you look at this, this is a big move.
[04:30.520 --> 04:36.680]  Owen Shroyer is riding shotgun, we have the two twin brothers on Jim Hofft of the Gateway
[04:36.680 --> 04:41.400]  Punnettus brother who lives in Asia, Joe Hofft who has incredible stuff to report to us.
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.800]  They don't think this is bad as some are saying and Mike Adams is back on and so much more
[04:45.800 --> 04:46.800]  today.
[04:46.800 --> 04:51.040]  We also have John Rappaport on, stay with us in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com, tomorrow's
[04:51.040 --> 04:52.040]  news today.
[04:52.040 --> 04:55.080]  We are still on air, we are at the tip of the spear, thanks to you keeping us here for
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.080]  this crisis.
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.080]  God bless you all.
[04:57.080 --> 04:58.080]  I salute the listeners.
[04:58.080 --> 05:00.520]  You are the resistance.
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.960]  Our constitutions, our health is our most valuable asset.
[05:05.960 --> 05:09.920]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.520]  And we've got to take care of our bodies, we've got to take care of ourselves.
[05:13.520 --> 05:20.480]  And all the products at FullWars.com have been researched deeply and have been developed
[05:20.480 --> 05:26.440]  with some of the top experts in the country to maximize what God's given us through Mother
[05:26.440 --> 05:33.040]  Nature, to help our bodies boost their defense against all the insane things that have been
[05:33.040 --> 05:36.200]  artificially introduced into our environment.
[05:36.200 --> 05:42.040]  So please visit FullWars.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet
[05:42.040 --> 05:47.400]  paper or flashlights that you really need, sure it's okay to have plenty of that, but
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.960]  it is high quality supplements and we've got the best.
[05:51.960 --> 06:03.400]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything 40% at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:03.400 --> 06:10.120]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:10.120 --> 06:16.800]  the Infowar.
[06:16.800 --> 06:22.440]  Anything we always warn you about, the global government using a bio-weapon threat to lock
[06:22.440 --> 06:28.880]  down the planet's industry and supply chains, globalism is world corporate government controlling
[06:28.880 --> 06:36.400]  global supply chains and making countries interdependent so nations are not self-sufficient.
[06:36.400 --> 06:43.680]  And whether it was Ted Turner or Prince Charles or all the big Silicon Valley heads and the
[06:43.680 --> 06:48.320]  major academic heads, their religion is depopulation.
[06:48.320 --> 06:52.480]  But first they have to hurt us in the compact cities, first they have to force inoculations
[06:52.480 --> 06:58.360]  on us, first they have to get us into their 5G, 6G control grids in the name of being
[06:58.360 --> 07:07.240]  protected from the new man-made viruses that will now come like hurricanes and tornadoes
[07:07.240 --> 07:11.800]  and earthquakes and there'll be weather reports on it, there'll be virus reports, mark my
[07:11.800 --> 07:12.800]  words.
[07:12.800 --> 07:18.680]  So many times did I tell you in films like Endgame and here on air that you will see
[07:18.680 --> 07:23.280]  first SARS and then the other viruses released out of China so they can always stage the
[07:23.280 --> 07:27.920]  hysteria and the fear because they're authoritarian working with the UN and the globalist to set
[07:27.920 --> 07:34.200]  the precedent for the control and then they would release more lethal viruses each time
[07:34.200 --> 07:36.960]  to train us to be more and more locked down.
[07:36.960 --> 07:41.080]  And once we're trained to be locked down then they can release the real mega weapons that
[07:41.080 --> 07:43.280]  actually depopulate by the billions.
[07:43.280 --> 07:45.240]  This is the stated plan.
[07:45.240 --> 07:53.880]  There are no less than four articles I read today on Infowars.com with the video, with
[07:53.880 --> 08:00.840]  the video from TV programs in the United States and Germany and France.
[08:00.840 --> 08:04.720]  German state TV celebrates coronavirus for killing off humans.
[08:04.720 --> 08:13.120]  We don't deserve better and they say the West and the old deserve it and there are
[08:13.120 --> 08:20.320]  top Twitter and Facebook personalities promoted by the left licking toilet seats on airplanes
[08:20.320 --> 08:27.200]  and in bathrooms, women and men, black and white saying it's our job to get it and spread
[08:27.200 --> 08:35.880]  it to kill boomers, spoiled, evil, millennials, not all are but these are literally reveling
[08:35.880 --> 08:43.480]  and it's time to depopulate the boomers playing now not just old off against young black off
[08:43.480 --> 08:49.840]  against white, not just all the male against female but now the sick and those that can
[08:49.840 --> 08:56.040]  die by those that are younger who don't die as easily.
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.440]  This is beyond Logan's run.
[08:57.440 --> 09:01.360]  Why do you think it's in all these movies where in the future they kill the old people
[09:01.360 --> 09:03.080]  or they kill the infirm?
[09:03.080 --> 09:06.920]  Why do you think they push it in Time Magazine and Newsweek, the case of Colin Grannie?
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.240]  Bill Gates has stated all this.
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.120]  I'm telling you admitted public plans.
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.360]  I have been literally mobbed going to the grocery store or out in the streets in a small
[09:18.360 --> 09:24.680]  town almost, when I say mobbed, almost everyone I talked to walks up and says, man, I should
[09:24.680 --> 09:25.680]  think you were crazy.
[09:25.680 --> 09:27.920]  How did you know about the martial law and the bio weapon?
[09:27.920 --> 09:37.040]  How did you know about if I'll swing this way back in the 1750s or whenever it was
[09:37.040 --> 09:41.240]  you live the day, there was a courier, you know, they had male delivery guys then struck
[09:41.240 --> 09:49.600]  by lightning in Germany and it blew his satchel and in it was a big stack of orders, each
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.800]  one going to each member of the Illuminati by Adam Weissop, the Jesuit priest, head
[09:53.800 --> 09:58.280]  of the Illuminati, which was this revolutionary group to overthrow, it's a real group.
[09:58.280 --> 10:03.960]  The police were able to use the battle plan to hold it off at least 15 years or so.
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.840]  They were able to launch it later.
[10:05.840 --> 10:12.920]  But the point is, you're asking me, the US broke the Japanese code, that's how we knew
[10:12.920 --> 10:15.880]  it midway and other places where they'd be.
[10:15.880 --> 10:20.600]  So you're asking me, Jones, how do you keep knowing exactly what's going to happen?
[10:20.600 --> 10:23.160]  They're publicly planning it.
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.040]  We've had to get millions of academics into the club of eugenics.
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.520]  My father never told me about how he was recruited.
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.120]  I knew he's recruited in high school and to plan to a UT and a bunch of government stuff.
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.480]  But I told you, it's 13, 14 years ago, he's at my studios on a Sunday.
[10:42.480 --> 10:43.720]  We're going to our Saturday.
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.640]  We're going to a ballet recital for my children, for my oldest daughter.
[10:48.640 --> 10:52.160]  And my mom comes in and I've got a big screen TV and I'm editing and we're about to go.
[10:52.160 --> 10:55.040]  They have the kids and they're like, come on, Alex, you're late.
[10:55.040 --> 10:56.400]  And I said, watch this.
[10:56.400 --> 10:58.960]  And I played the intro to end game.
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.200]  And my mother goes, David, there's no way it's that evil and that bad.
[11:03.200 --> 11:05.520]  He goes, well, actually, we get in the car to drive the ballet.
[11:05.520 --> 11:10.360]  He goes, no, the head of the body department that ran the secret program for eugenics.
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.480]  When I got the top test score and the top six tests in Texas, I've been in plan two for
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.480]  two years.
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.480]  He was like 14.
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.480]  Okay.
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.560]  And my dad won a contest and they sent him an 18-wheeler with a laser to see if he could
[11:22.560 --> 11:23.560]  put that together.
[11:23.560 --> 11:25.240]  And then it was all this whiz kid testing.
[11:25.240 --> 11:28.120]  It was really a government program to get the best kids in the government, not even
[11:28.120 --> 11:29.120]  knowing it.
[11:29.120 --> 11:30.480]  And he said, Carol, it's all true.
[11:30.480 --> 11:33.200]  He laid out the whole plan to us, the six of us.
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.400]  And he bought into it at first, but later got out of it in college.
[11:37.400 --> 11:41.800]  But the point is, is that this is the plan, folks, okay?
[11:41.800 --> 11:42.960]  This is the operation.
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.040]  And they plan on after they fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized
[11:48.040 --> 11:54.640]  you with the TV and put you in a trance on killing you, on killing you, but they've got
[11:54.640 --> 11:58.360]  to weaken you and make sure you're not going to panic too bad when they kill you.
[11:58.360 --> 12:00.320]  So they have to train you to shelter in place.
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.480]  They have to train you to wait where you're at so that they can put viruses in you that
[12:04.480 --> 12:08.120]  are binary so that later they can turn on 5G.
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.400]  This is documented in studies or other systems that resonate and trigger the virus or they
[12:13.400 --> 12:17.000]  can put a chemical in the water that then activates the virus.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.960]  They've got a lot of different ways to do it.
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.960]  It's all on record.
[12:19.960 --> 12:21.880]  Look up binary weapons.
[12:21.880 --> 12:23.680]  So we're already the walking dead.
[12:23.680 --> 12:26.760]  Most of us are going to be dead in a year, two years, five years.
[12:26.760 --> 12:27.760]  It's 2020.
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.840]  We told you that their plan by 2020 was to begin to launch a depopulation.
[12:31.840 --> 12:35.600]  My God, they carved them with Georgia guide stones while it's still available for free
[12:35.600 --> 12:42.760]  online, in-game, in-game, in-game, in-game, in-game, in-game, in-game, in-game, in-game,
[12:42.760 --> 12:43.840]  in-game, in-game.
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.080]  In-game blueprint for global Enslaved month.
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.000]  In-game blueprint for global Enslaved month.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.640]  In-game blueprint for global Enslave month.
[12:55.640 --> 12:58.480]  In-game blueprint for global Enslaved month.
[12:58.480 --> 13:01.600]  In-game blueprint for global Enslaved month.
[13:01.600 --> 13:07.280]  Endgame 2, which is also free, which they deleted off the Internet, the phase 2 total
[13:07.280 --> 13:08.280]  extermination.
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.400]  Endgame, phase 2, total extermination, endgame, phase 2, total extermination, endgame, phase
[13:14.400 --> 13:19.360]  2, total extermination, endgame, phase 2, total extermination.
[13:19.360 --> 13:22.000]  I interviewed the professors and scientists who blew the whistle on it.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.120]  They had government documents like Dr. Kaufman, he died a few years ago, were in the 60s they
[13:26.120 --> 13:31.240]  said we'll have transgenderism and sterilize all the males, we'll make it cool to sterilize
[13:31.240 --> 13:33.240]  boys.
[13:33.240 --> 13:37.600]  This is it ladies and gentlemen, this is their rollout and Trump tried to oppose it actually.
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.800]  He tried to block it, he tried to stop the hysteria, but now it's done.
[13:42.800 --> 13:49.600]  The corporations, the media, the big tech, the sports teams, all the virtue signalers,
[13:49.600 --> 13:55.520]  all the trendies, all the people that own the hotels and the resorts, they all are buying
[13:55.520 --> 14:04.040]  into it to shut the economy down and to be good little globalist servants.
[14:04.040 --> 14:07.440]  And so when we come back, I'm going to get Owen Shroyer's take on all this, but it's
[14:07.440 --> 14:11.720]  on, it's on, and they're going to set the precedent, the force will be inoculate you,
[14:11.720 --> 14:18.680]  take your guns, everything else, at the same time battle to make sure you don't learn about
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.960]  the known antivirals that are in the environment and have been known in the government's own
[14:22.960 --> 14:23.960]  studies.
[14:23.960 --> 14:27.920]  So make sure you don't know and you eat all your white bread and eat your GMO and get
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.360]  all your chemicals so you're good and stupid and dumb and die.
[14:32.360 --> 14:35.720]  So everyone's getting into the fun of being scared and all this right now.
[14:35.720 --> 14:39.840]  They're going to kill you and your family, all you bureaucrats watching and listening.
[14:39.840 --> 14:42.960]  I think this is all fun and you're part of the government, you're part of the power.
[14:42.960 --> 14:45.040]  You're going to die too.
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.240]  Everybody dies under the New World Order, except maybe one tenth of one percent that
[14:49.240 --> 14:53.160]  believe they're going to merge with machines and have made deals with this interdimensional
[14:53.160 --> 14:55.800]  thing that gave them all the technology.
[14:55.800 --> 14:57.360]  That's in mainline news too.
[14:57.360 --> 14:59.080]  Elon Musk talks about it.
[14:59.080 --> 15:04.800]  You can't make a deal with these aliens, okay, and the Bible tells you about and ever get
[15:04.800 --> 15:06.240]  off the planet, okay?
[15:06.240 --> 15:08.240]  You're all dead.
[15:08.240 --> 15:12.880]  You all made a deal with Satan, the fallen one fell from space.
[15:12.880 --> 15:13.880]  You made a deal.
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.280]  This ain't a John Carpenter movie from 1982.
[15:18.280 --> 15:20.520]  This is the real deal.
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.120]  Now we've got the transmission from the big guy how to beat this and we're going to beat
[15:25.120 --> 15:29.720]  it in the end, but most of you are going to die.
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.360]  Now remember, this will blow over, it'll have hundreds of thousands of deaths, whatever,
[15:34.360 --> 15:38.000]  but you'll be trained to lock down and then the next thing comes in a year or two and
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.560]  then the next one and then one hits its billions and you all sit in your houses and die and
[15:42.560 --> 15:45.480]  the drones are all out with weapons to make sure you don't leave your house.
[15:45.480 --> 15:50.720]  All a robot takeover, interdimensional plan, blueprint given to traders, collaborates with
[15:50.720 --> 15:52.640]  Satan against humanity and Christ.
[15:52.640 --> 15:53.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[15:53.640 --> 15:54.720]  This is the truth.
[15:54.720 --> 15:56.640]  This is the emergency transmission.
[15:56.640 --> 15:59.440]  Receive it or die.

[16:59.040 --> 17:02.480]  Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[17:02.480 --> 17:07.080]  If you've thought about the implication of food related supply chain disruptions and are concerned
[17:07.080 --> 17:11.920]  about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[17:11.920 --> 17:12.920]  Here's why.
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.840]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[17:16.840 --> 17:22.080]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns
[17:22.080 --> 17:24.920]  are just a few days away here in the US.
[17:24.920 --> 17:30.440]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom
[17:30.440 --> 17:33.160]  seeds to grow a one acre crisis garden.
[17:33.160 --> 17:38.040]  The truth is, growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single
[17:38.040 --> 17:39.960]  most important thing you do.

[18:00.520 --> 18:06.080]  The winds of change, the waves of change are here.
[18:06.080 --> 18:13.440]  The world has become decadent, the population has become hypnotized, and the globalists
[18:13.440 --> 18:16.080]  are moving in for the kill.
[18:16.080 --> 18:22.600]  First they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance.
[18:22.600 --> 18:27.080]  And once they've done that, once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the
[18:27.080 --> 18:33.960]  bio weapons, each more deadly than last, as they hurt us into the bubble, high tech control
[18:33.960 --> 18:42.080]  grid cities, until they finally release the ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate,
[18:42.080 --> 18:48.880]  which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years, and the controllers emerge from
[18:48.880 --> 18:50.880]  their underground bunkers.
[18:50.880 --> 18:54.120]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[18:54.120 --> 18:57.080]  They admit it, they publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[18:57.080 --> 19:00.360]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this, so remember who your enemies are.
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.840]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about, because there's
[19:04.840 --> 19:09.880]  so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it, it takes a long time to break down
[19:09.880 --> 19:12.240]  the product, because it's a complex product.
[19:12.240 --> 19:18.280]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth, your throat, and lungs are really thin, it's
[19:18.280 --> 19:21.320]  a little bit of alcohol if you want it to essential oils.
[19:21.320 --> 19:28.080]  Not our lung cleanse, it's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and
[19:28.080 --> 19:29.600]  ingredients in it.
[19:29.600 --> 19:36.000]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale, and it just does so much for me when
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.200]  I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[19:40.200 --> 19:44.240]  It's just very, very soothing, and it's just one more thing for you and your family to
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.920]  have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[19:47.920 --> 19:53.720]  So get your lung cleanse discounted at InfowarsStore.com and get yourself and your family prepared,
[19:53.720 --> 20:04.120]  while at the same time funding the Infowar a total 360 win, InfowarsStore.com.
[20:04.120 --> 20:22.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.280 --> 20:32.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:32.160 --> 20:34.480]  And so we are entering the end game.
[20:34.480 --> 20:39.200]  I tried to go out of town a few weeks ago, about a month ago, and things were so big.
[20:39.200 --> 20:42.280]  I came back early, I was gone three days.
[20:42.280 --> 20:48.200]  So my wife said, hey, how about we just go to a small town at a resort, walk around the
[20:48.200 --> 20:55.440]  woods with the kids, hang out at the lake, whatever, and I said, okay, then obviously
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.640]  as soon as I got outside of town, I had to call the crew here because things are deteriorating
[20:59.640 --> 21:00.640]  so quickly.
[21:00.640 --> 21:06.880]  Rather than in town this morning, 10 police cars at the city limit, big mobile testing
[21:06.880 --> 21:11.440]  units, RVs, it's martial law, they're getting ready for it.
[21:11.440 --> 21:19.160]  And they're going to lock down cities, they're going to test you for a fever.
[21:19.160 --> 21:20.440]  This is very serious.
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.440]  This is the end game.
[21:21.440 --> 21:26.360]  And I know I just went right to the end of the end game because if you study the globalist
[21:26.360 --> 21:31.760]  and what they say, Silicon Valley are not atheists, they believe they're going to become
[21:31.760 --> 21:37.880]  ascendant and live forever when they're able to merge themselves into an AI cloud is the
[21:37.880 --> 21:48.000]  main theory where consciousness is put into a highly compressed dust, that their whole
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.600]  consciousness is then in a piece of dust.
[21:52.600 --> 21:58.000]  And then that is then put into the atmosphere and that that consciousness is with us and
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  controls us.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.880]  Now, I've covered that on air a good 10 years before Johnny Depp had his movie transcendence.
[22:05.880 --> 22:08.320]  And I'll never forget, I was sitting there with people in the movie theater, some of
[22:08.320 --> 22:12.880]  the crew, and I leaned over and I said, watch, I hadn't read the spoilers, I said, watch,
[22:12.880 --> 22:14.880]  he'll become dust.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.240]  And sure enough, he becomes dust, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[22:19.240 --> 22:26.560]  Supposedly his death, he dies when he becomes the dust and he goes to Adam, God takes the
[22:26.560 --> 22:34.840]  dust and makes him and then takes a rib out of Adam and makes her, I mean, it's all just
[22:34.840 --> 22:38.240]  counterfeit, anti-Christ crap.
[22:38.240 --> 22:40.880]  These people believe it.
[22:40.880 --> 22:47.200]  And remember about a year after I was first on Joe Rogan, Elon Musk went on and said everything
[22:47.200 --> 22:49.000]  I was saying, people were really freaked out.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.400]  The globals believe they live forever, they live in interdimensional contact with beings.
[22:54.400 --> 22:56.040]  These people are crazy.
[22:56.040 --> 23:01.480]  They are in contact with really bad stuff or you can call it a mass psychosis of the establishment.
[23:01.480 --> 23:03.440]  They don't want to die.
[23:03.440 --> 23:08.640]  And they believe merging with machines will make them God, but for whatever reason I need
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.680]  to kill everybody in the process.
[23:11.680 --> 23:13.440]  Owen Schreuer is here.
[23:13.440 --> 23:18.080]  I'm going to have the Hoff brothers on from gatewaypundit.com, Jim Hoff, his brother Joe
[23:18.080 --> 23:20.440]  Hoff has been in Woonan during all this.
[23:20.440 --> 23:25.640]  He's been in Hong Kong, Taiwan, he's been in Australia, he's his twin brother.
[23:25.640 --> 23:27.560]  And he can tell you firsthand what he saw.
[23:27.560 --> 23:29.800]  They think it's being hyped up.
[23:29.800 --> 23:32.040]  I think it's fair to get the perspective.
[23:32.040 --> 23:34.200]  Mike Adams thinks they're wrong, says their math is wrong.
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.960]  Well, we're going to have Mike popping in as well.
[23:36.960 --> 23:39.120]  And then I haven't had Rappaport on who thinks it's a hoax.
[23:39.120 --> 23:43.680]  I'm trying to be fair and show both sides, but all of that is academic.
[23:43.680 --> 23:49.840]  The hysteria and the lockdown of the economy, while the border still stays wide open is
[23:49.840 --> 23:54.960]  martial law is the end of free society and shows anybody can release a designer bio weapon
[23:54.960 --> 23:59.320]  that if it kills anybody, there's total hysteria and we all run off the cliff like a bunch
[23:59.320 --> 24:00.320]  of limits.
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.040]  So let's go to Owen Schreuer has been a great job in traffic cop here and also he's got
[24:05.040 --> 24:06.520]  the war room coming up 3pm today.
[24:06.520 --> 24:08.720]  Owen, what's your take on the latest developments?
[24:08.720 --> 24:13.760]  The announcements of no gun purchases, no gun transfers, no traveling with guns, forced
[24:13.760 --> 24:19.280]  inoculations ready in Europe, starting the trials, the vaccine, of course, Bill Billamon
[24:19.280 --> 24:20.680]  and the Gates have it ready.
[24:20.680 --> 24:25.280]  I mean, this is the new world order striking back and Trump tried to kill the hype, but
[24:25.280 --> 24:31.040]  his whole corporate move controlling the supply chain and global governance against him is
[24:31.040 --> 24:33.640]  really illustrative of what we're really all up against.
[24:33.640 --> 24:37.920]  Well, I've been going through all the news here, Alex, while I've been listening to you
[24:37.920 --> 24:43.960]  and I think it's clear to decipher between what we know and what we don't know.
[24:43.960 --> 24:44.960]  What do we know?
[24:44.960 --> 24:50.920]  They are moving forward with some serious plans here, which we've known about because
[24:50.920 --> 24:53.920]  they've been trying to buy up all these emergency food and all these supplements.
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.360]  So they've been preparing for the worst on the back end for about a month now info wars
[24:57.360 --> 24:58.680]  has been reporting it.
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.840]  Now they're bringing it to the front lines, we're seeing bars nightclub shut down cities
[25:02.840 --> 25:07.440]  going into lockdown, they're clearing Bourbon Street, they're clearing downtown areas.
[25:07.440 --> 25:10.520]  And so this is the move to stall the economy.
[25:10.520 --> 25:16.120]  So you have the fear coming from the threat of a virus being hyped up by the media.
[25:16.120 --> 25:20.200]  So people will give up their freedoms willingly over the fear of the virus.
[25:20.200 --> 25:24.760]  And then you have the economic shutdown, all the leagues, professional leagues being shut
[25:24.760 --> 25:25.760]  down.
[25:25.760 --> 25:27.160]  I'm glad you said that.
[25:27.160 --> 25:31.080]  They're now saying in Europe, they're going to nationalize the companies and the government's
[25:31.080 --> 25:34.000]  going to take the companies over and merge in pure fascism.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.840]  That's fascism, by the way, folks.
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.760]  This is so incredible, the government coordinates and runs the companies, but they're still
[25:39.760 --> 25:40.760]  private.
[25:40.760 --> 25:41.920]  This is the big fascist coming out.
[25:41.920 --> 25:46.040]  The left always goes from left to then fascism historically.
[25:46.040 --> 25:47.040]  That's the plan.
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.480]  You just said the key there, Owen, that is actually eight weeks ago that they started
[25:51.480 --> 25:54.160]  hoarding the food and buying it all up and the medicines.
[25:54.160 --> 25:56.680]  We started telling people almost eight weeks ago.
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.840]  And then now that the establishments run to their already built underground bunkers with
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.080]  all their armored fortresses and the mountains all over the world.
[26:04.080 --> 26:07.400]  Now they're telling us they're going to shut everything off for us and, oh, that's the other
[26:07.400 --> 26:08.400]  big thing.
[26:08.400 --> 26:12.640]  Everybody that orders horrible food from us has either already gotten it or my patriot
[26:12.640 --> 26:13.640]  has it.
[26:13.640 --> 26:14.800]  It'll be shipped when they send to you.
[26:14.800 --> 26:20.520]  They had to cut food orders today, any future orders because all the other big supply chains
[26:20.520 --> 26:21.520]  are dead.
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.920]  All the big companies have bought up whatever was left and they just don't feel confident
[26:25.920 --> 26:30.840]  in getting it to people with any new future orders too far out in the future.
[26:30.840 --> 26:34.440]  No, the supply chains are breaking down and the food is running out, brother.
[26:34.440 --> 26:37.600]  And they're on the news because this is high-level industrial knowledge.
[26:37.600 --> 26:40.200]  On the news, they're telling you that everything's fine.
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.200]  There's plenty of food.
[26:41.200 --> 26:43.400]  It's a damn lie.
[26:43.400 --> 26:50.240]  Well, and as you can see, the panic that has engulfed individuals here for whatever reason
[26:50.240 --> 26:52.680]  toilet paper becomes the go-to thing.
[26:52.680 --> 26:54.600]  Police are now guarding sections.
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.960]  The toilet paper sections now have police security.
[26:56.960 --> 27:01.920]  Oh, you can only buy two rolls and then people that are just in their normal routine who say,
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.880]  okay, I'm going to buy, you know, eight rolls of toilet paper every two weeks or whatever.
[27:04.880 --> 27:06.200]  They can't even get toilet paper.
[27:06.200 --> 27:08.720]  So it's like a weird response.
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.880]  We've really seen how unprepared the average individual is for something like this.
[27:12.880 --> 27:13.880]  And then...
[27:13.880 --> 27:15.480]  Well, it shows the mind control.
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.880]  They're not trying to get what you'll really make money off of in a crisis is liquor, cigarettes,
[27:19.880 --> 27:21.080]  medicine, things like that.
[27:21.080 --> 27:24.840]  They're not worried about firearms or ammo, but notice the establishment's moving in
[27:24.840 --> 27:28.440]  on firearms, alcohol, and things that I know folks are really going to want, which means
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.520]  there's really going to be a long lock down.
[27:30.520 --> 27:34.320]  Because believe me, folks, when the drunks and the drug addicts figure out that there
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.720]  ain't no more Jack Daniels or Miller life, it's going to explode.
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.960]  Well, and Alex, let's, in the final minute here, get down to brass tacks, which is,
[27:43.960 --> 27:46.640]  I think, what you're focusing on here.
[27:46.640 --> 27:52.920]  And it's so difficult to really say with the power, the brevity in words, but this is what
[27:52.920 --> 27:54.520]  we've been expecting.
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.600]  This is, this is the globalist swinging for the fence.
[27:57.600 --> 27:58.600]  This is the ninth thing.
[27:58.600 --> 27:59.600]  This is the fourth quarter.
[27:59.600 --> 28:06.040]  This is the exact, yes, this is the exact globalist profile, and it's a manmade virus.
[28:06.040 --> 28:07.800]  They did the disease X profile.
[28:07.800 --> 28:11.040]  They did the tabletop 65 million dead four months ago.
[28:11.040 --> 28:13.160]  They had all the shows roll out on time.
[28:13.160 --> 28:16.920]  It's all synthetic, all dolled up, all dressed up like the prom.
[28:16.920 --> 28:20.640]  I mean, it is 100 percent their move.
[28:20.640 --> 28:26.600]  And the beauty of it is though, Alex, it's leaving a window of opportunity for America
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.440]  and for Trump to realize it because more people are tuning in to info wars right now.
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.320]  And by the way, this is why they wanted us off YouTube because let me tell you something,
[28:34.320 --> 28:35.320]  Alex.
[28:35.320 --> 28:38.680]  The sports world is tuning into info wars right now with no matches going on.
[28:38.680 --> 28:41.720]  The world that's not going to bars and all the stuff, they're tuning in info wars.
[28:41.720 --> 28:45.840]  They couldn't have us on YouTube because we're filling the void that the people don't trust
[28:45.840 --> 28:46.840]  fake news.
[28:46.840 --> 28:49.960]  That's why people are still going to bars and gyms because they don't buy the hysteria
[28:49.960 --> 28:53.680]  because the fake news is so proven fake.
[28:53.680 --> 28:54.680]  That's right, brother.
[28:54.680 --> 28:55.680]  Absolutely.
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.800]  And I'll tell you the next phase of the hysteria, we'll come back out and stop it.
[28:59.800 --> 29:02.840]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[29:02.840 --> 29:08.160]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data
[29:08.160 --> 29:13.080]  or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[30:00.360 --> 30:05.840]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.760]  world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[30:11.760 --> 30:17.000]  Info wars has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.240]  and are waiting for others to come back in.
[30:19.240 --> 30:26.640]  We have kept all the products that we have in stock massively discounted 20-50%.

[30:43.360 --> 30:48.880]  But it is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves
[30:48.880 --> 30:53.320]  and their families with the knowledge that God has given us.

[30:58.880 --> 31:00.280]  have them in stock.
[31:00.280 --> 31:01.760]  It's all over the news.
[31:01.760 --> 31:06.160]  It's being announced by politicians from Germany and the United States.
[31:06.160 --> 31:08.800]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[31:08.800 --> 31:11.360]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[31:11.360 --> 31:17.760]  Thank the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[31:17.760 --> 31:19.560]  Humanity is evil.
[31:19.560 --> 31:25.440]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner
[31:25.440 --> 31:30.560]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and
[31:30.560 --> 31:32.240]  control the population.
[31:32.240 --> 31:37.160]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying
[31:37.160 --> 31:38.840]  Trump isn't doing enough.
[31:38.840 --> 31:45.920]  Got a sickening in your face declaration of war against humanity by these control freaks
[31:45.920 --> 31:50.600]  who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[31:50.600 --> 31:52.000]  dumb us down.
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.240]  And then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly
[31:56.240 --> 31:58.400]  admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[31:58.400 --> 32:00.520]  It's time to expose the scum.
[32:00.520 --> 32:06.560]  Info Wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed.
[32:06.560 --> 32:13.480]  This is a system-wide problem and this country is facing a new depression unless Trump and
[32:13.480 --> 32:19.880]  the American people work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation.
[32:19.880 --> 32:21.400]  That's it.
[32:21.400 --> 32:25.560]  People are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock.
[32:25.560 --> 32:27.080]  We wish that wasn't sold out.
[32:27.080 --> 32:29.760]  They've confused that with the food.
[32:29.760 --> 32:36.240]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell, we have in stock and we are only one day
[32:36.240 --> 32:38.000]  behind in shipping.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.400]  That means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on a Wednesday.
[32:41.400 --> 32:43.360]  And that's just as of today.
[32:43.360 --> 32:48.120]  Most days we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order that day in the morning.
[32:48.120 --> 32:50.920]  A lot of times it ships out that afternoon.
[32:50.920 --> 32:58.640]  We have everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense against what's
[32:58.640 --> 32:59.920]  going on.
[32:59.920 --> 33:28.120]  Well, here are some of the headlines at infowars.com, newswars.com, and drugreport.com.
[33:28.120 --> 33:46.120]  In the summer now, it's forever, you see.
[33:46.120 --> 33:50.160]  We all live in our houses and big tech teaches us the new way of life and drones deliver us
[33:50.160 --> 33:52.240]  our food.
[33:52.240 --> 33:57.960]  The travelers struggle to get home as borders close, life in San Francisco screeches to
[33:57.960 --> 33:59.960]  a halt and a mid shut down.
[33:59.960 --> 34:01.800]  It's a ghost town.
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.040]  This is our generation's greatest threat, LA releasing inmates.
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.920]  Despite dire warnings, some refuse to give up routines.
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.320]  The blasio considering shelter in place, eat it.
[34:14.320 --> 34:16.120]  Stay in your homes.
[34:16.120 --> 34:17.120]  Stay in your homes.
[34:17.120 --> 34:20.320]  Marshall Law, New Yorkers hit favorite restaurants one last time.
[34:20.320 --> 34:26.440]  L.S. A.C.'s highest 24 hour death toll increase, tempers fray, casinos want bailout, hospitals
[34:26.440 --> 34:31.680]  first in nation to only treat coronavirus, patients, psychologists, science-based trips
[34:31.680 --> 34:38.160]  for emotional resilience, banks pressured as clients scramble for cash, upside down
[34:38.160 --> 34:40.160]  world of negative rates coming.
[34:40.160 --> 34:47.000]  For the saver, GDP could plunge 10 percent, economists warn, free money gains bipartisan
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.960]  support, talk about socialism with the people, but the government merging with companies,
[34:52.960 --> 35:02.040]  fascism, cash for the people, stock market could shorten hours, recession or depression.
[35:02.040 --> 35:06.640]  The White House is now talking about, President Secretary Mnuchin says financial markets will
[35:06.640 --> 35:13.200]  stay open, but could shorten trading hours and it just goes on.
[35:13.200 --> 35:19.040]  Iran warns, virus could still kill millions in Islamic Republic, Puerto Rico under 24
[35:19.040 --> 35:20.360]  hour isolation.
[35:20.360 --> 35:22.800]  All these governments want to use this for control.
[35:22.800 --> 35:25.040]  Trump bucked it.
[35:25.040 --> 35:28.400]  Joining us now, 15 minutes to the next hour, well, Jim Hoff's popping in, this is twin
[35:28.400 --> 35:34.440]  brother, Joe Hoff, who works and was in Hunan and has been all over the region during this
[35:34.440 --> 35:37.200]  to give us his analysis of this.
[35:37.200 --> 35:41.920]  I know Mike Adams has written an article saying their math is wrong, that the flu is
[35:41.920 --> 35:45.680]  not more deadly, he'll be able to pop in later, but I'm more interested in talking to Joe
[35:45.680 --> 35:51.400]  Hoff about what he's witnessed in Asia, being in Hunan during all this.
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.080]  But first, Jim Hoff, give us your take on all this, then we'll introduce your brother
[35:55.080 --> 35:56.080]  next segment.
[35:56.080 --> 35:58.800]  Great, Alex, good to be with you.
[35:58.800 --> 36:04.800]  Obviously, Joe and I are both big fans of Info Wars, and I'm really pleased to introduce
[36:04.800 --> 36:06.320]  Joe today.
[36:06.320 --> 36:10.080]  Joe is based in Hong Kong, he's a top executive in East Asia.
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.480]  He travels around Asia from Japan to China, Shanghai, and Beijing.
[36:15.480 --> 36:22.560]  He goes to Korea, he goes to Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, where he does audits
[36:22.560 --> 36:25.040]  of top companies.
[36:25.040 --> 36:30.320]  Very detailed audits is what he is in charge of, that is his job.
[36:30.320 --> 36:37.520]  Joe, as you recall back in the 2016 election, it was Joe Hoff who predicted 20 days out
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.680]  the exact day when Ted Cruz would be eliminated from the primary.
[36:43.680 --> 36:47.800]  And we were 100% right on that, we were 20 days early.
[36:47.800 --> 36:53.080]  And Joe's math actually ended up being only a few delegates off in totals.
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.440]  So this is my brother, he's been helping me at Gateway Punnett for several years, he's
[36:57.440 --> 36:59.360]  been my biggest fan.
[36:59.360 --> 37:07.200]  And Joe also was in Hubei province, where Wuhan is, his wife is from that area.
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.320]  He's been through Wuhan several times, he was in Hubei province this year in January
[37:13.320 --> 37:21.360]  and he actually believes that his family came under, that they were afflicted by this coronavirus.
[37:21.360 --> 37:26.280]  He also is in Hong Kong, the numbers from Hong Kong, you must listen to Joe when he
[37:26.280 --> 37:28.560]  describes the numbers from Hong Kong.
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.120]  And finally, we put up three very important posts.
[37:32.120 --> 37:40.480]  Joe found this today, the source of the 3.4% mortality rate is coming from the WHO Secretary
[37:40.480 --> 37:48.280]  General, that guy from Ethiopia, he's the one who first said 3.4% death rate for coronavirus,
[37:48.280 --> 37:53.920]  he has the world in a global panic because he misrepresented his numbers.
[37:53.920 --> 37:56.560]  Joe will be able to explain this.
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.840]  We also put up a post today, I hope your readers check out and listeners and viewers, and that
[38:01.840 --> 38:08.640]  is, we put the Corona death numbers today, the numbers are increasing, and we respect
[38:08.640 --> 38:14.240]  Mike Adams tremendously, he's a friend of ours, and we will see in the next few weeks
[38:14.240 --> 38:20.200]  you know how severe this coronavirus will get, but as of right now, the worst day of
[38:20.200 --> 38:27.440]  coronavirus deaths is below the average flu deaths per day in the year.
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.480]  And it's also lower than the average number of AIDS deaths per day per year.
[38:33.480 --> 38:38.920]  So we're looking at something that's been contrived at this point, we will see in the
[38:38.920 --> 38:45.000]  coming weeks in respect to Mike Adams, but at this point, we are not seeing anything
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.240]  that should have brought this country to its knees like it has.
[38:48.240 --> 38:52.560]  And I blame all of that like you do and your great reporters like Owen Shroyer and Paul
[38:52.560 --> 38:59.120]  Joseph Watson and all of your excellent reporters there, for pointing to the media who has traded
[38:59.120 --> 39:00.120]  this crisis.
[39:00.120 --> 39:03.560]  Well, what about, I want to go to your brother next segment and stay with us until then,
[39:03.560 --> 39:06.600]  so you can introduce him again, but then he'll be with us a little bit in the next hour,
[39:06.600 --> 39:07.600]  he'll have the floor.
[39:07.600 --> 39:09.760]  We're really fascinated here with what he has to say, we've been reading what he's
[39:09.760 --> 39:12.040]  had to say at the GatewayPunet.com.
[39:12.040 --> 39:17.200]  What about Tucker Carlson, I really respect him, I confirmed with Tucker last night that
[39:17.200 --> 39:21.600]  he did go, that news report, The New York Times is accurate because I don't usually believe
[39:21.600 --> 39:27.480]  The New York Times that he did go to Mar-Lago and meet Trump a weeks and weeks ago and
[39:27.480 --> 39:30.320]  said, listen, you got to at least say there's a problem because they're going to say you
[39:30.320 --> 39:33.920]  didn't respond and that he was instrumental in pushing Trump over the edge.
[39:33.920 --> 39:37.680]  We pushed Trump to say, you know, have a bigger response so the left wouldn't blame
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.520]  him for, you know, for anything that happened.
[39:39.520 --> 39:42.560]  We could see they were trying to frame the president as soon as he said, okay, I'll block
[39:42.560 --> 39:43.960]  flights from Europe.
[39:43.960 --> 39:46.160]  They took the bait and said, how dare you and tried to block it.
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.160]  So I think he's mitigating some of that, but I don't want to go too far on this hysteria.
[39:50.160 --> 39:55.160]  I'm literally looking at checkpoints being set up, they're not closed the roads yet,
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.920]  but two roads come into town where I met in Texas outside Austin.
[39:58.920 --> 40:05.400]  There are up to 10 police cars and dump trucks and, you know, all these other fire trucks
[40:05.400 --> 40:10.320]  and all this stuff and mobile command centers, RVs ready to block the roads.
[40:10.320 --> 40:12.800]  They're out there right now with fire department nurses.
[40:12.800 --> 40:16.360]  So I've got to get off the air here and let Owen take over soon and get my family and
[40:16.360 --> 40:18.920]  get back to Austin because they're going to shut all the cities down.
[40:18.920 --> 40:21.400]  They're not just going to shut interstate down folks.
[40:21.400 --> 40:23.440]  They're getting ready and they're waiting for the president's order.
[40:23.440 --> 40:28.040]  I've confirmed this from Connecticut, California, my law enforcement, military and legal sources
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.360]  that they're telling them all get ready to shut down, not just state borders, ladies
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.880]  and gentlemen, but towns.
[40:33.880 --> 40:34.880]  This is insane.
[40:34.880 --> 40:35.880]  Right.
[40:35.880 --> 40:36.880]  Right.
[40:36.880 --> 40:39.600]  And Bill de Blasio, by the way, will still go to the gym though.
[40:39.600 --> 40:43.720]  So it's only the little peons who lose their jobs and the middle class and the poor who
[40:43.720 --> 40:46.560]  are going to suffer the most as it usually is.
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.360]  I agree with Tucker Carlson and the fact that he pushed Trump to take this decisive action.
[40:51.360 --> 40:55.160]  And that is because Trump is in a no win situation.
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.720]  If he bucked the media, if he confronted the fake news media and said that they're full
[41:00.720 --> 41:05.480]  of crap, which of course they always are, then every death would have been blamed on
[41:05.480 --> 41:08.640]  Donald Trump for the next months and months.
[41:08.640 --> 41:12.280]  Donald Trump will go down as a coronavirus president.
[41:12.280 --> 41:14.680]  And so what he did was the right decision.
[41:14.680 --> 41:19.760]  He's doing everything that they hoped he wouldn't do so that they could take him down.
[41:19.760 --> 41:22.400]  Instead, he's looking like a leader right now.
[41:22.400 --> 41:27.600]  And in the next couple of days, maybe a week, maybe two, he needs to look at the real numbers
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.800]  and then re-decide and make another decision.
[41:30.800 --> 41:31.800]  That's right.
[41:31.800 --> 41:32.800]  Exactly.
[41:32.800 --> 41:33.800]  He can't get stampeded now.
[41:33.800 --> 41:35.120]  He's doing a great balancing act.
[41:35.120 --> 41:36.720]  He wasn't doing enough earlier.
[41:36.720 --> 41:39.200]  We warned him and now they jumped the gun.
[41:39.200 --> 41:42.120]  Now the Democrats, I'm sure you know, have been celebrating it, hoping it brings down
[41:42.120 --> 41:44.920]  the economy, hoping it kills the boomers.
[41:44.920 --> 41:47.760]  What a sickening group of anti-human trash.
[41:47.760 --> 41:49.160]  Absolutely.
[41:49.160 --> 41:51.600]  And I can tell you, and I know you're seeing this yourself.
[41:51.600 --> 41:54.640]  Trump has lost zero supporters, zero.
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.120]  No one has left his base because he has done everything that he could to, you know, to
[42:00.120 --> 42:01.680]  help the country.
[42:01.680 --> 42:03.080]  He's done a phenomenal job.
[42:03.080 --> 42:06.600]  It's just a shame that there are all these forces against him.
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.480]  We call this 2.3, 3.0, 2.3.0.
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.400]  Because of course, this is the first time that the deep state is trying to take him
[42:14.400 --> 42:15.400]  out.
[42:15.400 --> 42:16.400]  You're right.
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.560]  It's the globalist, the big corporations who create a wall of hysteria that the president
[42:20.560 --> 42:22.400]  doesn't block them bringing down the economy.
[42:22.400 --> 42:23.400]  It's his fault.
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.680]  So now he's chosen, okay, think of how bad it would be, Jim, in closing.
[42:27.680 --> 42:29.040]  We'll come back with your brother.
[42:29.040 --> 42:31.040]  Think of how bad it would be.
[42:31.040 --> 42:32.040]  Hold on.
[42:32.040 --> 42:33.040]  Hold on.
[42:33.040 --> 42:34.040]  I have this one question.
[42:34.040 --> 42:35.040]  Then your brother will take over the next few segments.
[42:35.040 --> 42:36.280]  What would it be like right now?
[42:36.280 --> 42:37.280]  Jim Hoff, you're a smart guy.
[42:37.280 --> 42:38.280]  I want your opinion on this.
[42:38.280 --> 42:39.280]  I respect it.
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.280]  If Hillary would have won, you know they were going to use this playbook regardless.
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.960]  GatewayPunet.com, and then NewsWars.com, Infowars.com, and Bandot Video.
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.080]  Jim Hoff and his brother, who lives over in Hong Kong, are on the other side.
[42:52.080 --> 42:54.160]  You don't want to miss this exclusive information.
[42:54.160 --> 42:57.960]  Tell everyone about the show to break Big Tech's censorship blockade.
[42:57.960 --> 42:59.560]  Spread the links now.
[42:59.560 --> 43:04.960]  Our constitutions, our health, is our most valuable asset.
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.480]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[43:09.480 --> 43:10.480]  We've got to take care of our bodies.
[43:10.480 --> 43:12.720]  We've got to take care of ourselves.
[43:12.720 --> 43:19.480]  All the products at InfowarsStore.com have been researched deeply and have been developed
[43:19.480 --> 43:25.440]  with some of the top experts in the country to maximize what God's given us through Mother
[43:25.440 --> 43:32.040]  Nature to help our bodies boost their defense against all the insane things that have been
[43:32.040 --> 43:35.240]  artificially introduced into our environment.
[43:35.240 --> 43:41.080]  So please visit InfowarsStore.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet
[43:41.080 --> 43:44.120]  paper or flashlights that you really need.

[43:49.960 --> 43:50.960]  the best.
[43:50.960 --> 43:58.280]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything 40% at InfowarsStore.com.
[43:58.280 --> 44:04.280]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the
[44:04.280 --> 44:09.440]  world, raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[44:09.440 --> 44:14.920]  Infowars has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[44:14.920 --> 44:17.120]  and are waiting for others to come back in.
[44:17.120 --> 44:24.520]  We have kept all the products that we have in stock massively discounted 20% to 50%.
[44:24.520 --> 44:29.120]  The average discount is 40% right now on our best selling items.
[44:29.120 --> 44:35.440]  So stock up on things for you and your family during this crisis, bolster your body, bolster
[44:35.440 --> 44:41.240]  your defense, be as healthy as you can so that we can all make it through this together.
[44:41.240 --> 44:47.080]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves and
[44:47.080 --> 44:51.200]  their families with the knowledge that God has given us.
[44:51.200 --> 44:56.560]  Be sure and visit InfowarsStore.com today and take advantage of these items while we
[44:56.560 --> 44:59.240]  still have them in stock.
[44:59.240 --> 45:00.720]  It's all over the news.
[45:00.720 --> 45:05.120]  It's being announced by politicians from Germany and the United States.
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.760]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[45:07.760 --> 45:10.320]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[45:10.320 --> 45:16.720]  Thank the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[45:16.720 --> 45:23.600]  Humanity is evil, all the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements,
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.720]  all the Ted Turner and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus
[45:28.720 --> 45:33.960]  to depopulate and control the population and now it's here and they want to lock down society
[45:33.960 --> 45:37.800]  and are licking their lips and saying Trump isn't doing enough.
[45:37.800 --> 45:44.840]  What a sickening in your face declaration of war against humanity by these control freaks
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.560]  who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.560]  dumb us down and then when we resist call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when
[45:54.560 --> 45:57.360]  they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[45:57.360 --> 45:59.240]  It's time to expose the scum.
[45:59.240 --> 46:04.800]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities in China that then spread to
[46:04.800 --> 46:10.280]  Europe and now San Francisco is a ghost city and we see fights and brawls taking place
[46:10.280 --> 46:12.000]  over toilet paper.
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.360]  People don't need toilet paper to survive but people do need high quality water filtration
[46:17.360 --> 46:25.280]  and they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3
[46:25.280 --> 46:31.240]  bodies, ultimate turmeric formula and of course our high quality silver gargle products and
[46:31.240 --> 46:38.840]  super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil and of course iodine as well.
[46:38.840 --> 46:44.520]  There are so many other amazing products at infowarstore.com ready to ship.
[46:44.520 --> 46:51.000]  Our shipping department is getting every order out within 24 hours and shipping it directly
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.200]  to your door.
[46:52.200 --> 47:09.880]  So get prepared and get ready now with things you really need at infowarstore.com.
[47:09.880 --> 47:32.200]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this emergency Tuesday.
[47:32.200 --> 47:38.120]  March 17 transmission Jim Hoft has been absolutely on target threading the needle here.
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.920]  Jim had to respond to the massive hysteria where they would say every death was his fault.
[47:42.920 --> 47:48.800]  Stalin said one death is a tragedy, 10,000 is a statistic and we pushed him hard to have
[47:48.800 --> 47:53.040]  a bigger response because it was clearly a big organized synthetic hysteria.
[47:53.040 --> 47:57.160]  How deadly the virus was we're not sure but it's gone down from 15% and lands it down
[47:57.160 --> 48:01.120]  to a couple percent, a couple percent still devastating.
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.280]  Joe Hoft is his twin brother who's an executive in Asia who was inside Wuhan or other areas
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.880]  during this crisis but Jim, just in closing, what would have happened if Hillary was in
[48:10.880 --> 48:11.880]  power?
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.120]  We know they've had this disease X ready, they've had the tabletop exercises, the Bill
[48:15.120 --> 48:19.400]  and Melinda Gates last year, all the movies coming out right on time, all the Netflix
[48:19.400 --> 48:20.960]  shows about pandemics.
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.560]  We could see their big rollout, there's like a race war rollout and Russia Gate rollout.
[48:25.560 --> 48:27.760]  You'll fail, you can see all the programming there.
[48:27.760 --> 48:33.680]  So we know it's synthetic as plastic fruit or as a Zimbabwean note or a Weimar Republic
[48:33.680 --> 48:37.080]  note but just in closing, if Hillary would have been here, they were still going to play
[48:37.080 --> 48:38.720]  this card, I think.
[48:38.720 --> 48:42.840]  What would be happening now and then introduce your brother to us again?
[48:42.840 --> 48:45.040]  Right, right, thank you Alex.
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.720]  If Hillary was in charge right now, it would be a completely different picture that we'd
[48:49.720 --> 48:50.720]  be looking at.
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.280]  Donald Trump is the only global leader, not just American leader in history but global
[48:55.280 --> 49:01.000]  leader that had the guts to shut down traffic from China when no one else would and he got
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.680]  ridiculed for that and then he shocked us all when he shut down the traffic from Europe
[49:05.680 --> 49:08.640]  and that became the central base for this disease.
[49:08.640 --> 49:10.960]  So no other leader would have done that.
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.720]  Hillary would have had open borders, you know that, we would have had thousands and thousands
[49:15.720 --> 49:21.200]  of people flooding in and China, they never would have banned the flights from China like
[49:21.200 --> 49:22.400]  Donald Trump did.
[49:22.400 --> 49:27.120]  We'd be looking at a complete disaster if Hillary was president today and as far as
[49:27.120 --> 49:31.520]  my twin brother goes, I would like to add, Joe travels around the globe, he sits on
[49:31.520 --> 49:40.160]  board meetings, he's a vice president of one of the top 250 companies in the world.
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.960]  We did check, you know, several actuaries who a lot of insurance companies use to base
[49:46.960 --> 49:53.200]  their numbers for us so that they make sure they make a profit each year, Joe works with
[49:53.200 --> 49:59.720]  these people and we did check with an actuary this week when we put up our post first but
[49:59.720 --> 50:06.840]  Joe also was in Hubei province, he has some very interesting things to say about China's
[50:06.840 --> 50:12.040]  health care and he also has, you know, first hand information of what's going on in Hong
[50:12.040 --> 50:13.040]  Kong today.
[50:13.040 --> 50:17.240]  All right, thank you so much, Jim Hobbs of GatewayPunna.com.
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.240]  Let's go to your brother.
[50:18.240 --> 50:21.280]  Sir, thanks for being here, start wherever you'd like when we really appreciate you coming
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.280]  on.
[50:22.280 --> 50:23.920]  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.480]  Yes, I am, it's a little, well, it's almost one o'clock in the morning right now so we're
[50:29.480 --> 50:34.080]  about 12 hours ahead of you there on the east coast so it's, yeah, it's a pleasure to be
[50:34.080 --> 50:35.080]  here, Alex.
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.080]  Thanks for staying at that post, sir.
[50:37.080 --> 50:41.480]  Yeah, go ahead, no, I'm really happy to be here, it's a real honor, it's great to see
[50:41.480 --> 50:45.320]  Jim too, every time I see Jim, I smile so it's nice to see Jim here as well and thanks
[50:45.320 --> 50:47.680]  for the nice introduction, Jim.
[50:47.680 --> 50:53.520]  I guess maybe what I triggered this invite, Alex, was the post that we put up yesterday
[50:53.520 --> 50:58.440]  and you know, Jim and I are real close, we're twin brothers, we're identical twin brothers
[50:58.440 --> 51:03.680]  and we talk all the time and Jim started his website years ago as you know and has built
[51:03.680 --> 51:09.760]  that into one of the biggest websites in the U.S. and one of the biggest conservative
[51:09.760 --> 51:17.280]  for sure, Columbia Journalism Review rated Jim's website one of the top four conservative
[51:17.280 --> 51:23.040]  websites in the U.S. during the 2016 election, InfoWars was right up there as well, Alex
[51:23.040 --> 51:27.320]  as you well know and Harvard did a similar study, I think they might even use the same
[51:27.320 --> 51:28.320]  data.
[51:28.320 --> 51:32.840]  I think the purpose of their studies back then was to point out that there was fake news
[51:32.840 --> 51:36.520]  and this is why Hillary lost and it was the total opposite as you know.
[51:36.520 --> 51:42.800]  The fake news was our media and people broke through that media through websites like InfoWars
[51:42.800 --> 51:49.760]  and the Gateway Pundit and we helped save America and we can't thank you enough for
[51:49.760 --> 51:54.920]  all that you've done over the years and I tell you what, one of your greatest strengths
[51:54.920 --> 51:59.240]  is finding some of the greatest talent out there and Jim and I are great fans of some
[51:59.240 --> 52:06.080]  of the guys that work with you including Owen and our individual from the U.K., Mr. Watson
[52:06.080 --> 52:09.280]  who actually happened to be out here in Hong Kong not long ago.
[52:09.280 --> 52:13.760]  I reached out to them and weren't able to connect but really think they're just fantastic
[52:13.760 --> 52:14.760]  guys too.
[52:14.760 --> 52:19.600]  So anyways, shout out to the InfoWars and all the great work you do.
[52:19.600 --> 52:23.800]  The point of today probably more than anything is to talk about obviously the coronavirus
[52:23.800 --> 52:29.360]  and maybe what a scam and a sham it is and I guess as I said to Jim earlier tonight,
[52:29.360 --> 52:34.760]  it reminds me more of the Mueller investigation than probably anything else.
[52:34.760 --> 52:41.720]  This is a sham put President Trump in a very difficult spot again.
[52:41.720 --> 52:47.840]  He's handling it great but it's also built on a bunch of lies and this is what we pointed
[52:47.840 --> 52:50.880]  out yesterday in a post.
[52:50.880 --> 52:56.920]  The number that's been floating around in the mainstream and I tied it today overnight
[52:56.920 --> 53:03.960]  to since early March came from the WHO, the World Health Organization and they came up
[53:03.960 --> 53:10.800]  and there was a presentation by the head of the WHO where he said in early March that
[53:10.800 --> 53:20.360]  the coronavirus, the fatality rate on the coronavirus was 3.4 percent and that shocked
[53:20.360 --> 53:25.920]  everybody and scared the heck out of everybody and so if you think three or four out of every
[53:25.920 --> 53:31.800]  person living is going to die, that's how I think a lot of people took it.
[53:31.800 --> 53:37.240]  The facts are he was using data based on actual counts at that time.
[53:37.240 --> 53:42.040]  Now the thing that was most disturbing and we put it up in a follow-up post this morning
[53:42.040 --> 53:52.120]  was that his next sentence he said, but the flu gets only 0.1 percent of fatality and
[53:52.120 --> 53:56.440]  so when he put those two together, obviously the average person is going to compare the
[53:56.440 --> 54:04.840]  flu to the coronavirus and this coronavirus is at 3.4 percent where the flu is only 0.1.
[54:04.840 --> 54:09.160]  Now both those numbers are somewhat accurate in what the data that we have today but he
[54:09.160 --> 54:16.120]  convoluted them and I'm glad you're putting this chart up here.
[54:16.120 --> 54:23.320]  This is what we did yesterday and in the far right column we talk about the seasonal flu
[54:23.320 --> 54:27.720]  in the US and we compare the data that's out there from the CDC to the WHO and what we
[54:27.720 --> 54:36.320]  can see is what they did and what this individual did from the WHO is he compared apples to
[54:36.320 --> 54:38.400]  oranges and so let me explain.
[54:38.400 --> 54:49.800]  According to the CDC, there's about 22,000 deaths over the past year for the flu.
[54:49.800 --> 54:55.960]  Joe, let me stop you, I know you're in Hong Kong and so we may have to reconnect with
[54:55.960 --> 54:59.960]  you or maybe it's my connection where I'm at, I'm also remote.
[54:59.960 --> 55:04.760]  Let me ask the network, is he clear?
[55:04.760 --> 55:06.680]  So his Skype is clear.
[55:06.680 --> 55:10.440]  Okay, well let's reconnect with him.
[55:10.440 --> 55:14.200]  We're going to break anyways here in two minutes, let's reconnect with him.
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.520]  This is so critical, he was in Wuhan, he was in that province, he was there, his wife
[55:19.520 --> 55:27.240]  is from that area, he's an executive at a major Fortune 250 company on the bottom, half
[55:27.240 --> 55:33.120]  of that rung which is the top half and he's a smart guy, he's well known, I read his articles
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.080]  and reports because we really want to hear from him on what he actually witnessed there.
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.760]  There's no doubt they're moving this against Trump, there's no doubt they're hoping it
[55:39.760 --> 55:44.320]  brings down the economy, their own record and for me that's the most incredible thing
[55:44.320 --> 55:48.560]  is if I went on air and I don't think this but if I went on air and said I hope this
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.520]  destroys America and there's too many people, I hope it kills a bunch of boomers, my career
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.080]  would be over, it should be.
[55:56.080 --> 55:59.480]  In fact, if you saw me on the street, I'm not using for violence, but if somebody's calling
[55:59.480 --> 56:04.960]  for everybody to die, they deserve to get punched in the nose, okay?
[56:04.960 --> 56:13.960]  But that's how insane all of this has gotten and they're the ones that are the villains,
[56:13.960 --> 56:17.920]  they're the ones that are anti-human, they're the depopulation UN, they're the chai comms,
[56:17.920 --> 56:20.600]  I don't believe a damn thing comes out of them.
[56:20.600 --> 56:24.000]  But Jo Hoff was there, we're going to come back from break.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.880]  Please remember, we're illiterate supported, we have, we can't ship storable food to you
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.320]  now, all the food you order, you'll get but the food chain's done, they can't get more.
[56:33.320 --> 56:37.520]  It's all, it's devastating, that's the behind the scenes stuff we'll talk about next hour.
[56:37.520 --> 56:42.920]  But we have the supplements in stock, you order the turmeric, that's so good for you,
[56:42.920 --> 56:49.760]  you order the silver gargle, you order the super blue toothpaste that has the nano silver
[56:49.760 --> 56:54.880]  in it, the super silver toothpaste sold out, the whitey toothpaste, you order the X2, the
[56:54.880 --> 56:58.680]  X3, we have it now and it ships within a day, we're about a day behind.
[56:58.680 --> 57:02.960]  So you order on a Tuesday, we ship it out on a Thursday, we're about a day behind right
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.640]  now, some days we're shipping out the same day, but we're a little bit behind one day.
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.840]  But we've got it all in stock in our warehouse in Texas and they're going to have delivery
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.240]  still rolling during this lockdown, this is to train us to be slaves, but they'll still
[57:15.240 --> 57:21.080]  have deliveries going at least for now, you want to get your products in your body and
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.080]  defending yourself and boosting you and your families.
[57:25.080 --> 57:28.760]  Overall redundancy in your cells and your body is so critical and all these products
[57:28.760 --> 57:32.680]  are top of the line and very high quality, you also need water filtration system, we
[57:32.680 --> 57:38.720]  have the Alexa Pure, highest rated, the Pro Pure in our warehouse, in the warehouses, ready
[57:38.720 --> 57:46.000]  to ship you now, infowarstore.com and it funds the info war, keep us on the gear, take action
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.440]  and protect your family today, second hour straight out.
[57:49.440 --> 57:58.320]  The winds have changed, the waves have changed, are here, the world has become decadent, the
[57:58.320 --> 58:05.000]  population has become hypnotized and the globalists are moving in for the kill, first
[58:05.000 --> 58:13.160]  they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance and once they've done that,
[58:13.160 --> 58:19.280]  once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the bio weapons, each more deadly
[58:19.280 --> 58:26.840]  than last as they hurt us into the bubble, high tech control grid cities until they finally
[58:26.840 --> 58:31.880]  release the ultimate bio weapon with a 100 percent kill rate, which then mutates into
[58:31.880 --> 58:39.800]  a harmless bug after a few years and the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers and
[58:39.800 --> 58:43.640]  of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well, they admit it, they
[58:43.640 --> 58:47.480]  publicly talk about their plan to kill us all, a lot of liberals are celebrating this
[58:47.480 --> 58:50.480]  so remember who your enemies are.
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the public service announcement, info wars
[58:55.160 --> 59:01.860]  as of today is now suspending storeable food sales, we still have storeable food, we're
[59:01.860 --> 59:04.960]  able to package all the storeable food and get it to everybody that ordered it, most
[59:04.960 --> 59:09.000]  of you have already gotten your food, but the reason I'm making this announcement is
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.560]  all the other major food suppliers were sold out over a month ago as we first reported
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.720]  to you, but they lied to you and they took your money, well we know for a fact they're
[59:18.720 --> 59:24.840]  still taking everybody's money, even though the food has all been sold out, the basic
[59:24.840 --> 59:30.480]  ingredients for storeable food is gone, all the big box stores are paying way over normal
[59:30.480 --> 59:35.520]  prices to buy up what's left and so anybody telling you that they have storeable food
[59:35.520 --> 59:40.600]  is lying to you, the good news is everyone that ordered an info wars store dot com has
[59:40.600 --> 59:44.440]  already gotten it or if you ordered recently we have the food is being packaged and you
[59:44.440 --> 59:49.480]  will get it, but as of now we are suspending all new food sales at info wars store dot
[59:49.480 --> 59:53.480]  com.
[59:53.480 --> 1:00:17.080]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, Joe Hoff is a vice president executive at a major
[1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:22.000]  corporation in Asia, it's a global corporation, he's whether it's skype's having a few problems
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.520]  and I didn't know that Jim Hoff is still here with us, he's always hard to get on so any
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:31.080]  time Joe cuts out we'll go to Jim, Joe, thanks for the pleasantries and I appreciate that
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:34.640]  and you're absolutely right about trying to set the president up, get into what you actually
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:40.160]  saw and the numbers and what you saw in Wuhan province, the epicenter of this, the next segment,
[1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:45.480]  this is your short segment, tell us the provenance of the virus, where you think it came from
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.600]  and who you think is behind it, please continue.
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:54.240]  Okay, well let me finish with the numbers first then, so what we saw was that what's
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:01:07.000]  going on is the head of the WHO, can you hear me okay, sorry, the head of the WHO he's comparing
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:14.560]  the actual rates for the coronavirus, so the actual number of people tested and confirmed
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:19.920]  versus those people that have died to come up with the fatality rate, but when they compare
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:27.240]  the flu, they're grossing up the number by 36 million people and then estimating the
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:34.240]  fatality rate and it comes up to 0.1, so the difference between the two is the 36 million,
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:39.520]  so when you, and so it's apples to oranges, there's no amount that they're grossing up
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:44.280]  for the coronavirus, there's no estimate for people that have had this thing that don't
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:49.840]  know it, like we know with the flu, you get the flu and you move on and sometimes you
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.480]  don't go to the doctor, it's not a major deal, because we're finding that's the same thing
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:58.120]  with the coronavirus, if you see people on TV, etc., they're saying I had it, I didn't
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:03.640]  even know it, and I'll tell you, so my wife and I and our child, we were up in Wuhan,
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:09.320]  near Wuhan, in early January, news was coming out about the coronavirus, we came back to
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:17.360]  Hong Kong after visiting her relatives there for a week or so and a week or so afterwards,
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:22.720]  I had a temperature for a couple days and I had a headache for about a week and I took
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:27.320]  some of my repro fun and I never went to the doctor for it and my wife had a problem with
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:31.760]  a cough for about three or four nights and I can remember telling her, hey, can you do
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:33.200]  something for that?
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:38.320]  And she did, but it just wasn't going away, finally that went away and our son for two
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:45.600]  days had a temperature of 103 and we kept our eye on him and we didn't want to bring
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:49.680]  him to the hospital because by this point people were starting to get worried about
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:56.560]  this thing, I didn't want my young son stuck in a hospital for a couple weeks, so we just
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:00.360]  kept our eye on him and after a couple of days it went away, so I think it's highly
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:07.120]  likely that we had this thing and yet it wasn't real serious, obviously.
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:14.160]  And those individuals like me are not being counted in the current number for the coronavirus,
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:19.200]  so by not doing that, by not counting all these people that got it that didn't die or
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:26.240]  that didn't get seriously ill or weren't confirmed, they've grossly overstated the fatality rate
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:32.600]  for the coronavirus and that's the point of our article yesterday and to put the flu
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.600]  rate with the coronavirus rate in the same sense is not accurate, it's comparing apples
[1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:39.320]  to oranges and that's the point of our piece.
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:43.480]  Well I think that's a very reasonable point, Mike Adams wrote an article, I know you've
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:49.560]  seen it saying that your numbers are wrong but for me I've always pointed out that even
[1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:53.080]  flu is overblown because it's whoever is the very sickest that goes to the hospital,
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:57.800]  most people never report it and maybe one out of a hundred and so that's skewing numbers
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:03.640]  of a higher flu death rate because only those that are super sick go to the hospital.
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:11.320]  That's right and I was made aware of his article and I think what he and he's got some arguments
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:15.640]  there and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt but I don't agree with what he's saying
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:23.320]  and what he's done is he hasn't fully accepted the fact that there's 36 million people that
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:29.840]  were added to the flu numbers to make this flu fatality rate point one percent and there's
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:30.840]  none.
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:35.880]  So what you witnessed in China, what you witnessed in Australia, for me the big takeaway is the
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.120]  one minute break so we'll be right back, for me the big takeaway is the big variable is
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:44.520]  most people never report it, most people never get discovered, most people survive, they're
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:48.920]  out of the equation to only use these smaller groups who again are the ones that are the
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:49.920]  very sickest.
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:54.280]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, we'll be right back with the Gateway Plum, let's
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:58.640]  stay with us.

[1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:15.440]  Well really sad days for America, sad days for the world, our economy now in the jaws
[1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:19.440]  of a globalist bio weapon attack, how deadly it is we're not sure but we know it spreads
[1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:25.200]  fast and kills people and now the entire corporate media, big tech, the left are calling for
[1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:29.760]  gun confiscation, hell they are banning the sale of guns in many cities and transporting
[1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:35.440]  of guns and they are now telling us that it's going to last 18 months, dire new report forces
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:44.960]  US and UK to change force on strategy and they say oh sorry, now you don't get to leave
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:50.000]  your house for 18 months, well there's not food for 3 months with societies shut down
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.520]  like this but don't worry, government and corporate brigades will take control of your
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:59.640]  farm and your ranch and they will run it now and get you the food so this is corporate
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:04.760]  fascism directed with communism under it, the real globalist structure just like communist
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:10.840]  China so and believe me all the anti-futurists are not going to be getting jobs in this now.
[1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:15.760]  This is a globalist takeover and Trump is doing the right thing responding to it so they can't
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:19.080]  make him irrelevant in the hysteria wave they've sent in.
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:25.800]  Jim Hoff is here, gatewaypundit.com owner and director and of course Joe Hoff is here,
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:31.880]  his brother who lives in Hong Kong and is a major executive over there and who was inside
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:36.600]  Wuhan province when all this was breaking loose and in that area, in that province surrounding
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:41.360]  Wuhan, so Joe describe to us what you saw, what you really witnessed and what you're
[1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:46.160]  really seeing in Asia and what really happened in Hong Kong with the real numbers are there
[1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:50.720]  because we're told it's all peaked in China and it's move on, now it's all Trump's fault,
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:54.320]  America's fault and we've all just got to go bankrupt now and that's just the way it
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:59.720]  is because the democrats love us so Joe and then Jim poppin' anytime, again twin brothers
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:03.720]  here, Joe give us your take on what's really going on and what you witnessed.
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:12.160]  We also went, which was in early January, there was no signs of the coronavirus per
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:16.960]  state but what there were signs of on our trip back, you could already see travel which
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:23.320]  was slowing and so we flew back through Shenzhen which is right across the border to Hong Kong
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:29.280]  here and then across the border and already there was a bit of fewer people traveling
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:36.920]  at that time, what happened then around the Chinese New Year, which was January, it's
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:43.880]  the Chinese New Year, they shut down Hong Kong and they, Hong Kong, give them a leak.
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:49.280]  Yes, hold on, we're going to go back to you Joe, from Hong Kong, Jim go ahead.
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:54.120]  It sounds like Joe's line is breaking up a little bit, I'll fill in and maybe they can
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:09:00.280]  reconnect to Joe but what happened was Joe went back to China or back to Hong Kong and
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:05.840]  of course your viewers know that this is right across the bay from mainland China, Shenzhen
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:10.520]  is right there and you walk across the hall when you get to customs, you're in China,
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:16.280]  you're in Hong Kong but Hong Kong did was they shut their border and so for the first
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:23.080]  couple months they had 100 cases in Hong Kong, a city of 8 million, a city of 8 million
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.600]  only had about 100 cases and two deaths.
[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:32.560]  So they're trying to make this out like it's the biggest catastrophe since a black plague
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:39.960]  and this is a city that is right across the bay from China and they've had 100 cases,
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:44.360]  now it's gone up a little bit, I think they have five, seven deaths, I'm not sure exactly
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:47.520]  but again we're talking about a population of 8 million.
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.800]  So Joe is back to work today and most of China is going back to work.
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:57.240]  This isn't getting a lot of press, Shanghai Beijing is back to work, his offices in Shanghai
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:59.360]  and Beijing are back to work.
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:04.520]  Joe is at work today, that picture that he showed you that you put up on the screen earlier,
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:06.880]  that's him at work in Hong Kong today.
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:10.800]  They have to wear those masks when they go back to work.
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:16.920]  So his office, now I believe last week it was 50% staff, this week I think again it's
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:18.320]  100% staff.
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:26.320]  So Hong Kong is going back to work but the numbers there were just ministerial, you would
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:32.880]  think if it was right next to China, to mainland China that there would be this huge number
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:37.120]  of coronavirus deaths and it never happened.
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:40.800]  So a couple of things, yeah.
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.640]  That is an amazingly important point because I've seen it in the news but Barry, China
[1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:50.560]  says they peaked last week, they said they're going back to work, everything's fine but
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:55.880]  then the media hardly covers it and just now they're saying 18 months we can't leave our
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:59.840]  houses and the Democrats in each city they control like San Francisco, they're totally
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:04.160]  locking it down, they're licking their lips about this Jim.
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:05.960]  Right, absolutely.
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.440]  I think Joe might be back, he can tell you more about what's happening here today.
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:12.640]  Joe, I mean China is saying it peaked last week, is that true?
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:16.000]  I hear you're back to work even though you boarded China.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.640]  Well, yeah, that's right.
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:26.360]  So we were mandatory shut down for about a week after the new year and then we've been
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:33.440]  working from home for about a month and then last week we were back to 50% and we're hoping
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:37.080]  to get back to 100% here in Hong Kong within a couple of weeks.
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:44.280]  Our offices in China are now back in 100% going back to work.
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:49.760]  So yeah, China appears to be going back to work which is puzzling because it's like,
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:54.640]  okay, you told us this was, the pictures were horrible as this thing came out, now they're
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:00.720]  going back to work and I can see a strategy for China here is that see look what we did
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:06.960]  by shutting down everything, total control over everybody, we saved the day.
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:12.320]  Now the West needs to do the same thing, shut everything down and you too will save the
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:17.440]  day and I think that's maybe the point too to all this too.
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:23.840]  With this craziness and with forcing everybody to stay at home, what they do then is if we
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:30.760]  have no deaths like the real rates might show that it might even be less than the flu virus,
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:35.560]  the fatality rates, then they'll say, well, the reason they're so low is because we saved
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:41.920]  the day, we kept everybody home and locked up and that's why the rates aren't so bad.
[1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:48.480]  But on the other hand, so they've really put themselves in a pretty good position as far
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:49.640]  as how to manage things.
[1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:53.360]  I guess one thing Alex that's going on with China which I've noticed and been writing
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:58.720]  about for the last couple of years is the fact that their economy is in horrible shape.
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:06.520]  Trump stepped in and he smashed them and I talked to CEO who was talking to CEOs a year
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:13.480]  ago who were saying the economy was horrible and they were moving their business to Southeast
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:14.480]  Asia.
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:19.960]  I talked to another plant manager who owns or not owns but oversees an operation in China
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:27.440]  that has 3,000 in the non-peak time, 9,000 peak time and they are looking down in Southeast
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:33.560]  Asia as well as they want to expand their operations and he told me that they couldn't
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:39.280]  find room in Vietnam now because it's all the Chinese that have moved down there.
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:44.920]  So they're building a facility in Taiwan and so what's happened over the last few years
[1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:50.560]  is Trump has absolutely done what he's wanted to do which is get business out of communist
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:55.600]  China and get it into hopefully the more freer states around the world, especially the U.S.
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:00.800]  Exactly, so America wins this trade war, America wins this trade war and now this comes out
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:01.800]  of nowhere.
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:04.040]  Who do you think is behind it?
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:07.360]  I think the timing and the scripting is too perfect Joe.
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:08.360]  I agree.
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:15.680]  That's what makes me think it's a similar mule or there's just too many similarities.
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:19.160]  The media was totally in on this.
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:23.280]  I think I've heard somebody say is that the deep state and China that were involved very
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:30.720]  well could be they certainly are aligned against President Trump so it could be very well could
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:31.720]  be.
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:37.240]  All right, extremely powerful, Joe I'd like to have you back on, I'll be back in studio
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:41.000]  tomorrow to your phone line because your skype's been okay but I think phone line, landline
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  if you can do it.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  And I want to thank Jim.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.680]  Jim, you're a busy guy, you're hard to get on.
[1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:48.440]  Anytime you want to come on JimHoffGatewayPundit.com and it's twin brother.
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:52.800]  Very important information, very revealing, a key piece of intel.
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:56.840]  China is basically back to business but it's all over for us 18 months, America will never
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:14:58.200]  exist again.
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:02.840]  Take force inoculations, turn all our guns in and the Democrats run everything.
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:04.480]  That doesn't sound too good to me.
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:07.640]  So thank you very much gentlemen.
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:09.200]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:13.000]  Wow, okay, Mike Adams is coming on.

[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:29.640]  The left is jumping on all this to get full control.

[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:11.400]  The world has become decadent, the population has become hypnotized and the globalists
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.000]  are moving in for the kill.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:20.560]  First they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance.
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:25.040]  And once they've done that, once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:31.920]  bio weapons, each more deadly than last as they hurt us into the bubble high-tech control
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:40.040]  grid cities until they finally release the ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate,
[1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:44.680]  which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years.
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:48.840]  And the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers.
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:52.040]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:55.000]  They admit it, they publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.360]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this, so remember who your enemies are.
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:03.800]  Our constitutions, our health is our most valuable asset.
[1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:07.720]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:11.360]  And we've got to take care of our bodies, we've got to take care of ourselves.

[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:34.060]  artificially introduced into our environment.
[1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:39.920]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:45.120]  paper or flashlights that you really need, sure it's okay to have plenty of that.
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:49.800]  But it is high quality supplements and we've got the best.
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:20:18.440]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything 40% at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:30.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:59.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have Zach Voorhees, who's been a high-level Google
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:05.320]  executive pointing out that suddenly Google is not censoring as much now that Trump basically
[1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:10.160]  had the globalist head that called for Trump's death fired.
[1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:14.360]  So big movements behind the scenes that Trump's involved in, I don't want Trump to use martial
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:18.400]  law to take out the deep state, I want him to use the law to do it, but they're trying
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:20.520]  to create martial law to take him out.
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:25.120]  So if they start it, well, then Trump can finish it in that threat continuum of what's
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:28.960]  going on separately at the start of the next segment.
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:32.760]  And I'm going to show you something very interesting about yours truly.
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:36.920]  And then I'm going to hand the baton over to Owen Shroyer, Zach Voorhees, and others.
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:42.440]  But I wanted Mike Adams, who's done a great job predicting this would be a giant hysteria,
[1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:46.920]  predicting they'd try to shut down society, predicting they would lock everything down.
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:53.160]  His numbers vary from what Jim Hof's brother and others have, but regardless, the crisis
[1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:54.880]  is real.
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:58.960]  The supply chain, now they're talking about 18 months locks in your houses.
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:01.640]  Well, China says they're already back to work.
[1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:04.400]  Hong Kong's already halfway back to work.
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:09.440]  So I guess we just permanently shut down here and we all die in our homes, become skeletons,
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:12.160]  and we turn all our guns in for us to take force inoculations.
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:13.160]  It's just crazy.
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:16.840]  Mike Adams, what's the latest and what's your perspective on the situation and when
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:22.080]  you think Trump's going to declare that interstate travel ban or if that won't happen?
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:25.640]  I know Austin, Texas just closed all bars and restaurants.
[1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:30.840]  Well, here's the situation as I see it, Alex, and thanks for having me on.
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:35.120]  Social distancing is the only thing that works to stop the spread of this virus.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:38.720]  And you just had the Hof brothers on from Hong Kong, and the reason that this is not
[1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:43.480]  a big problem now in Hong Kong and Taiwan and Singapore is because they've done massive
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:49.200]  testing, contact tracing, and lockdowns that have lasted for many weeks.
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:53.080]  And the United States is not doing that until recently and it's only being done in liberal
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:54.080]  cities.
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:58.800]  So the situation that I'm very, very concerned about, Alex, is that we have liberal cities
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:03.960]  like San Francisco now doing the lockdowns on the social isolation that works while we
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:08.560]  have conservative publishers such as the Gateway Pundit who are really frankly in a state of
[1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:11.640]  denialism about this and saying it's no worse than the flu.
[1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:16.960]  So we're going to have conservative America complacent spreading this and having deaths
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:21.480]  among Trump voters who tend to be more, more elderly anyway.
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:24.280]  Meanwhile, the liberal cities are actually tackling this.
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:26.840]  They're going to go through a lockdown for a few weeks.
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:32.440]  The virus will basically be over after the lockdown because social distancing works and
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:33.960]  they're not going to lose any of their voters.
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:38.840]  So this is, this is a perfect storm for Trump to lose the election.
[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:42.520]  And I have to put the blame on conservative publishers right now.
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:44.280]  That's my honest assessment, Alex.
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:48.160]  Too many conservative publishers are going into a state of denial over this.
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:54.280]  And even, even info wars is not yet up to speed in my opinion on how severe this is
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:59.080]  and what a threat this is to the Trump presidency in the future of America.
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:02.000]  Social distancing is what works and we're not doing it yet.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:06.800]  I mean, I think it's open for discussion about the fact that most people that get it
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:08.600]  just get sick and never go report it.
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:10.760]  So those numbers are not being put in the equation.
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:15.360]  So what we are up to speed on is a full spectrum analysis of everything that's going on.
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:19.760]  See, when you're a guest on info wars, Mike, you are putting forward that information on
[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:20.800]  info wars.
[1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:25.640]  So people are getting that perspective, which you say is reality.
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:27.360]  And so that's what we're doing.
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:31.920]  And so that's why we're having Zach Voorhees thinks it's really bad virus.
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:34.880]  And you know, he's, he's coming on next talk about another, another subject.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:38.720]  So I don't, I think it was fair for you to say you don't support the communist Chinese.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:40.680]  I meant they did a total lockdown.
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:43.760]  I mean, there's, you know, that into the spectrum and the Italian into the spectrum
[1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:45.840]  versus what some people are saying.
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:49.760]  So I think open debate and discussion about this, I mean, I think it's really, really
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:50.760]  healthy.
[1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:55.080]  And I think the leftist cities want to test everybody to create as much fear as possible
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:57.840]  and then find as much death as possible to hype it.
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:59.480]  They're all very happy about it.
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:03.480]  And they also have feces and needles and disease everywhere.
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:07.720]  And they're also the main areas of sanctuary cities where people are coming in and all
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:08.960]  this stuff is being spread.
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:10.400]  I mean, are they the heroes now?
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:12.040]  Are the liberal cities the heroes?
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:14.280]  Well, no, I, of course not.
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.480]  And they're going to suffer high rates of death because of their conditions.
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:24.840]  But when we have people from the conservative side of things saying that this is no worse
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:29.200]  than the flu, and you know, Rush Limbaugh has been saying that for weeks, it is truly
[1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:33.720]  bad misinformation and it, it creates complacency, Alex.
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:36.800]  And so, you know, when you have conservatives who say, Oh, it's no big deal.
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:37.800]  I'm going to get on an airplane.
[1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:38.800]  I'm going to go have a party.
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:39.800]  I'm going to go do this.
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:43.240]  They're going to spread it to other people who are in their social circle.
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:46.560]  And you're going to end up infecting more and more conservatives and killing Trump supporters
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:49.160]  because they're mostly elderly.
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:54.120]  And in the end, this doesn't help the country.
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.920]  Have we ever found out how many people really died in China or there's just no telling?
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:03.960]  Well, there's, there's no telling exactly from, from China because of course their numbers
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:04.960]  are low.
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.160]  And I think that's where your overall out of caution, Mike, let me hold you over.
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:14.080]  I think that's overall where I agree in, in the general, in the main with what you're
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:15.080]  saying.
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:19.160]  And I bet I think it's good to debate and discuss it because we don't know it's man-made.
[1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:20.680]  It has an HIV delivery system.
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:23.760]  It's coming back as we reported both of us six weeks ago.
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:24.760]  That's confirmed now.
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.880]  I think there is cause we really concerned about it.
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:30.280]  I just think other people are going too far the other way because they don't like the
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:32.280]  left using it for a power grab.
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:36.800]  You and I have been saying if Trump doesn't move into that vacuum, he'll be overthrown.
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:39.360]  So I think really we've created a full spectrum analysis.
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:42.240]  Well, I understand that, Alex, I understand your point.
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:46.120]  And again, I appreciate you having me on, but we can't, it can't be both a deadly engineered
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:48.200]  bio weapon that's going to depopulate the planet.
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:51.040]  And then the next week it's the total hoax that's no worse than the flu.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:53.040]  I mean, which is it?
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:54.040]  Which is it?
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:55.720]  I've been consistent on the day one.
[1:26:55.720 --> 1:27:00.000]  When I have guests on, when I have guests on with their perspective, that does not become
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  our organization.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:05.560]  Like CNN gets one view and that's who they have on as guests for one view.
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:10.800]  So does MSNBC, Fox, to a certain extent, we want an absolute free for all here to get
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:11.800]  all the views.
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:12.800]  Does that make sense?
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:15.720]  Well, yeah, but, but again, this is a bio weapon.
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:16.720]  You know it's a bio weapon.
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:18.880]  It's engineered to kill humanity.
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.640]  It's a depopulation weapon.
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:24.920]  If we don't get serious about how to deal with it, then we are going to be depopulated.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.160]  That's the goal is depopulation.
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:32.300]  And the trap for Trump is not doing enough early enough, in my opinion.
[1:27:32.300 --> 1:27:34.400]  And Trump right now, he's kind of taken the middle ground.
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:36.400]  It was great what he announced yesterday.
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:37.640]  That's a great start.
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:39.160]  That's going to help the situation.
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:45.440]  However, in my opinion, he needs to be more aggressive in getting people to stay home.
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:46.440]  We have to stay home.
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:47.720]  We have to flatten the curve.
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:53.160]  If we don't flatten this curve, our hospitals get overrun in about four to six weeks and
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:54.160]  you're going to see it.
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:57.400]  We're all going to see it, especially in the cities like like New York City.
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:58.960]  It's going to be bad.
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:27:59.960]  Mark my words.
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:00.960]  It's going to get bad there.
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:05.760]  Well, hopefully we'll still all be on air able to cover this, you know, you said something
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:06.760]  yesterday.
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:10.360]  Yeah, we have millions of abortions a year, but that's not communicable.
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:13.400]  Well, what is communicable is hysteria.
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:16.600]  And I think, you know, you're prepared out there with your farm and all your stuff and
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:17.600]  you've been smart.
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:20.480]  So I understand you're already in this mindset and I agree, pandemics are going to be the
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:21.480]  globalist tool.
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:23.320]  This is something they've launched.
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:28.760]  But with a limited kill rate, but pushing the hype to kill our economy, that's definitely
[1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:33.600]  a possibility or it could be the very bad end of the spectrum.
[1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:37.200]  I mean, if it's 2% that it kills, it's just devastating.
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:42.240]  And I made calls to eight nurses yesterday that I know, I mean, 12, eight of them answered
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:46.600]  and I've got some information I want to talk to you about on the other side briefly with
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:50.800]  Mike Adams to give us his perspective on the latest developments than Zach Borges on
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:52.680]  what in the world is going on at Google?
[1:28:52.680 --> 1:28:54.040]  Big changes there.
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:55.040]  Stay with us.
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:58.000]  I'm Alex Jones, news wars dot com.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  Hello, Patriots.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:03.040]  My name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle real estate dot com.
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:06.960]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead
[1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:08.440]  my family to freedom.
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:12.840]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:16.400]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:23.920]  estate team is here to help go to black rifle real estate dot com.

[1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:03.920]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities in China that then spread to
[1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:09.720]  Europe and now San Francisco is a ghost city and we see fights and brawls taking place over
[1:30:09.720 --> 1:30:11.160]  toilet paper.
[1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:16.520]  People don't need toilet paper to survive, but people do need high quality water filtration
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:24.360]  and they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA force plus X2 and X3
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:30.400]  bodies, ultimate turmeric formula and of course our high quality silver gargle products and
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:38.000]  super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil and of course iodine as well.

[1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:10.040]  world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:14.920]  Others has done the opposite despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:17.120]  and are waiting for others to come back in.

[1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:47.080]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves and
[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:51.200]  their families with the knowledge that God has given us.

[1:31:56.760 --> 1:31:58.160]  have them in stock.
[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:02.640]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about because there's
[1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:07.680]  so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it, it takes a long time to break down
[1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:10.080]  the product because it's a complex product.
[1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:16.080]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth for your throat and lungs are really thin.
[1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:19.160]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you want it to essential oils.
[1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:20.440]  Not our lung cleanse.
[1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:27.440]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:33.880]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale and it just does so much for me when
[1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:38.080]  I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:42.080]  It's just very, very soothing and it's just one more thing for you and your family to
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:45.760]  have in your arsenal during these insane times.

[1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:02.080]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:09.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:22.520]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here, broadcasting worldwide, finishing up here with Mike Adams
[1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:27.000]  from naturalnews.com, I want to do one personal thing here right now.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.720]  You've seen national news demonizing me massively last week.
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:35.360]  You've seen the false claims that we've said we have a coronavirus cure.
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:38.640]  I never said anything of the sort.
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:43.280]  We've only talked about studies that are out there about what happens with certain types
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:44.880]  of silver up against viruses.
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:45.880]  That's well known.
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:51.800]  The very company that we get our silver from is sales to hospitals, Walmart, I mean they
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:56.800]  have a prescription type, they have a regular type, but that's just the media misrepresenting.
[1:33:56.800 --> 1:33:57.800]  We don't have cures.
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:01.960]  We don't have treatments for any of that.
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:09.520]  But another one of the other big attacks is Alex Jones ordered for drug and alcohol testing.
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:13.560]  I've been ordered despite no criminal record with drugs or alcohol, I was found under the
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:19.360]  legal limit when the police did a DUI test, still took me to jail.
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.040]  That's just how America is now, okay, because they've ordered them, well even if they're
[1:34:24.040 --> 1:34:26.440]  under, just take them to jail.
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:27.440]  So that unfolded.
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:31.000]  Look, the police aren't bad, they're just robots now in order to do what the central
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.960]  control groups tell them.
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:38.560]  But I've been drug tested multiple times because of false accusations.
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:44.640]  And I've been alcohol tested eight times before, almost four-day test, in whole family court
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:45.640]  fights.
[1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:51.080]  Volunteered as well, every time I've been found negative, negative, negative, negative,
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.440]  negative for all these drugs.
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:58.720]  People see me with energy and they see me upset and they think, that guy must be on
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:34:59.720]  drugs.
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:06.040]  Well, it's like a breed of dog, you know, that you read about, that has energy like
[1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:11.400]  a bird dog, versus a breed of dog like a bastard hound that doesn't have energy.
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:15.640]  Or a Jack Russell terrier has a lot of energy, but say a blood hound doesn't, unless he's
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:17.600]  chasing a person.
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:18.600]  It's the same thing.
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:25.000]  I walk around, I see all these zombies everywhere, and it scares me how sluggish folks are.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:26.560]  So it's just crazy.
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:30.040]  People get up in court and they go, look at the energy he's got, he's on cocaine.
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:32.120]  I hate cocaine.
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:36.440]  I've tried it a few times in college and stuff, hate it, horrible.
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:41.600]  I have to take the depressant alcohol, which I've stopped many times for years or months
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:46.480]  different times, because I have so much energy, I like to drink sometimes at night to forget
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:50.360]  about stuff, to turn it down, okay?
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:52.240]  That's how this works.
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:57.000]  So I'm very manic about freedom, folks, and it's normal.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.160]  So let's put on screen.
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:01.920]  The statesmen and others, oh Alex Jones ordered a drug and alcohol testing, but you won't see
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:08.840]  reported as again for the upteens time, negative, negative, negative, negative, negative, negative,
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:15.600]  negative, negative, nothing in me, a 10-panel drug test, testing for everything.
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:22.000]  No amphetamines, no cocaine, no opiates, no methadone, no marijuana, no hallucinogens,
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:28.320]  nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.000]  I've had one cup of coffee today, and I've got to be careful about drinking it or I turn
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.040]  into a huge jerk.
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:38.280]  So again, we've got more serious things to deal with here, but I'm going to, I think
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:41.600]  I'm going to dig up the other drug tests too from over the years, you know, whenever my
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:44.600]  ex-wife asks for it or whenever I go to get sent off of the judge, I never ask for her
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:45.600]  to be tested.
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:48.680]  I think I'm going to frame them on the hallways in the office, because I told her there's
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:53.600]  a whole rumor that I'm a cocaine head, folks, I'm not, I hate cocaine.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:58.840]  I'm naturally have this energy, and it's like people go, oh, he must be controlled or he
[1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:04.320]  must be funded or he must be told what to say, because, you know, his stuff's so accurate.
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:05.520]  I'm smart.
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:06.520]  I'm engaged.
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:07.520]  All right.
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:08.520]  I want to finish up here with Mike.
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:16.160]  Mike, I think it's good for us to have these discussions, and so all I'm saying is in the
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:21.680]  fairness of debate, I don't think when you speak and say, well, infowars, you know, is
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:27.160]  saying that this isn't happening because I have the Hoff brothers on, I think it's interesting
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.480]  to have them on and get their perspective, and that's exactly what I did.
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:36.760]  So I just really think that the college of discussion here is something that's not happening
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:37.760]  anywhere else.
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:41.640]  Every other media outlet has their bottom line and what their worldview is, and that's
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:42.640]  what's stuck to.
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:46.600]  I personally don't think we figured out exactly what's going on here yet, and I think it's
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:47.600]  very healthy to do that.
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:48.600]  What do you think?
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:53.000]  Well, you know, it's your platform, and I respect that, and I'm a fan of the Hoff brothers
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.640]  and their work at the Gateway Pundit over all these years.
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:37:59.920]  They were really instrumental in helping, you know, expose the lies of the left-wing
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:00.920]  media.
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:04.440]  So I'm a fan of their work, but you know me, when I disagree with somebody's numbers,
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:07.160]  I'm just going to say it, and that's what I'm saying right now.
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:11.560]  Not attacking their personalities or their ethics.
[1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:14.240]  I'm just saying that, you know, look, the numbers are wrong.
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:18.160]  Their numbers are just flat out wrong, and I've explained that in my article.
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:21.880]  So they're good people with the best of intentions, bad math.
[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:22.880]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:25.440]  But you know, look, I respect you and your platform.
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:27.200]  I know you respect my work as well.
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:29.400]  I'm happy to come on and give my view.
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:33.400]  I think that it is interesting we have this spectrum.
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:36.520]  So what's going to happen in April, May, and June?
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:41.720]  Are we going to have the, you know, the Joe Hoff version of the world where it's over,
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:44.640]  you know, the Steve Pachinic version, it's over April 15th?
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:48.160]  Or is it the Mike Adams version where this thing is collapsing hospitals in New York
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:53.920]  City and there are probably tens of thousands of deaths, if not hundreds of thousands worldwide
[1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:54.920]  by the summer?
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:57.880]  So I guess we're going to see, I'm happy to come on and contribute.
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:00.320]  I'm never going to, you know, hold back.
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:01.320]  You know me.
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:02.320]  You know that.
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:03.320]  I respect your platform.
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:04.320]  What is your model show, though?
[1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:05.320]  Millions dead in the U.S.?
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:09.480]  If Trump doesn't take action, a couple hundred thousand if he does.
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.280]  And then worldwide, how many hundreds of thousands, or millions, how many?
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:15.480]  The millions have already been averted.
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:19.000]  So in the United States right now, we can choose between tens of thousands of deaths
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.960]  or hundreds of thousands of deaths, depending on what Trump does from here forward.
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:27.440]  There's already very strong social distancing factors in place in many cities like San Francisco
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:28.640]  and the Bay Area.
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:32.680]  So the number of deaths, I should say the number of lives being saved by these decisions is
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:37.120]  huge and Trump's decisions have saved lives to block flights from Europe and block flights
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:40.080]  from China or people from China.
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:44.400]  Those decisions have saved at least 800,000 lives already, according to my models.
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:46.560]  The question is, how many more lives do we save?
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:50.120]  And I guess, you know, from your point of view, how much liberty do we give up in order
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:51.520]  to save those lives?
[1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:52.520]  I get it.
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:53.520]  That's a legitimate question.
[1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:54.520]  There's a spectrum.
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:40:00.000]  You're going to have to choose between, you know, lockdowns and fewer deaths or no lockdowns
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.600]  and a lot more deaths.
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  That's the debate.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:04.480]  So I appreciate you let me be part of it.
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:07.240]  I'll continue to give you what I think.
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:12.240]  Well, Mike, I mean, I think you've done a great job overall, predicting the hysteria
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.400]  and chronicling of the virus is manmade.
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:18.760]  And for me, the biggest issue is the Democrats are trying to blame Trump.
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:22.680]  We predicted that clearly he's gotten ahead of it at least partially.
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:28.160]  So that to me, debating even how how deadly it is, I think overall is a distraction.
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:31.680]  I agree that politically, they're trying to use it to devastate the economy.
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:36.480]  And we need to expose who had the background, who transferred it to him, why the Chai comms
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:37.480]  released it.
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:40.400]  And obviously, it's still hurting people over there.
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:44.080]  They're just claiming they're OK now because they incubated it as you predicted six weeks
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:49.800]  ago, launched it and then the CDC hit it from Trump, told him it was OK.
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:54.660]  As soon as he said it was OK, Fauci flipped and now contradicts Trump on the stand every
[1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:55.960]  time he can.
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:59.480]  You can see the setup just like they've done to him over and over again.
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:03.600]  This is another cool attempt and it just shows how real Trump is.
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.040]  And it's just amazing.
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:07.080]  So Mike, I it is.
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:09.680]  Let me just let me just have this final point.
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:12.320]  I tried to call 12 nurses that I know.
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:15.840]  I went through my Rolodex people I've known for a long time, people that are practicing
[1:41:15.840 --> 1:41:16.840]  nurses.
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:17.840]  One was a man.
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:18.840]  The others are women.
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:23.800]  Eight of them answered and all of them new people in local hospitals, whether it was
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:28.760]  Omaha, Nebraska or Dallas, Texas and some of these places they said had cases we haven't
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:29.760]  heard of in the news.
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:30.760]  I think there's a cover up going on.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:34.120]  They don't want a panic of people that have coronavirus.
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:40.640]  And all the people I've talked to said that the people are fighting for their lives and
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:43.760]  they're almost all of them not even really super old.
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:46.200]  They're like 40 to 60.
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:50.320]  And you know, one guy was on a ski trip to Switzerland.
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:52.720]  He's been in there over a week and a half almost killed him.
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:53.840]  He's turned the corner.
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:58.720]  They say it's excruciatingly painful and they say that it just suddenly hits you and you
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:01.320]  just feel like falling over just like we saw in China.
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:05.760]  So I think that just prima facie talking to people points out that whatever this is,
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:08.440]  if you get it, it's really bad.
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:12.720]  And really a point you made that's really good is that the mortality rate of the virus
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:17.320]  itself may not even be as important as whether we have hospital beds available.
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:22.720]  It's the lack of hospital beds that's going to end up killing more people than would otherwise
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:23.720]  have to die.
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:27.760]  So that's why we have to flatten the curve and spread out the time of hospitalizations
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:30.640]  and not have a peak that overloads the hospitals.
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:31.640]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:32.640]  All right.
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:33.640]  Thank you, Mike Adams.
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:34.640]  NaturalNews.com.
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:35.640]  Thank you.
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:39.040]  Zach Vorheist takes over on the other side of this break.
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.280]  I'll introduce him and then hand it back on to Owen Troyer, who's doing a fabulous job.
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:46.160]  I'm sure Owen has been waiting in the dugout as my relief header here, but he'll probably
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:47.440]  be hosting some of his own show today.
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:51.680]  We've got some other great guests coming up as well on The Warren, 3 p.m. Central, every
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:57.480]  day at band.video.newswords.com or slash show on local stations in your area.
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:03.040]  The winds of change, the waves of change, are here.
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:10.400]  The world has become decadent, the population has become hypnotized, and the globalists
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:13.040]  are moving in for the kill.
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:19.560]  First they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance.
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:24.040]  And once they've done that, once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:30.920]  bioweapons, each more deadly than last, as they hurt us into the bubble, high-tech control
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:39.040]  grid cities, until they finally release the ultimate bioweapon with a 100% kill rate,
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:45.840]  which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years, and the controllers emerge from
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:47.840]  their underground bunkers.
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:51.040]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:54.040]  They admit it, they publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:57.480]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this, so remember who your enemies are.
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:03.680]  Info wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed.
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:10.600]  This is a system-wide problem, and this country is facing a new depression unless Trump and
[1:44:10.600 --> 1:44:17.000]  the American people work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:22.680]  That said, people are calling and saying, we wish you had the supplements in stock.
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:24.200]  We wish that wasn't sold out.
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:26.840]  They've confused that with the food.
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:34.080]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell, we have in stock, and we are only one day behind
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:35.080]  in shipping.
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:38.920]  That means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on a Wednesday, and that's just
[1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:40.520]  as of today.
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:45.240]  Most days we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order that day in the morning.
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:48.040]  A lot of times it ships out that afternoon.
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:55.760]  We have everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense against what's
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:58.160]  going on.
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:04.160]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:09.560]  world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:14.800]  Info wars has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:17.000]  and are waiting for others to come back in.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:24.400]  We have kept all the products that we have in stock massively discounted 20 to 50%.
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:29.000]  The average discount is 40% right now on our best-selling items.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:35.320]  So stock up on things for you and your family during this crisis, bolster your body, bolster
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:41.160]  your defense, be as healthy as you can so that we can all make it through this together.
[1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:47.000]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves and
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:51.080]  their families with the knowledge that God has given us.

[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:11.120]  And we've got to take care of our bodies, we've got to take care of ourselves.

[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:33.840]  artificially introduced into our environment.
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:39.680]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet

[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:47.320]  I'm coming to you from a town outside Austin and I'm about to get in the car and leave
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:53.360]  because the police are masked on the entrance to the town and the other entrance with dozens
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:57.240]  of police cars and command centers and more coming in and they're clearly getting ready
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:47:58.240]  to block roads off.
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:01.840]  We've got confirmation of that all over the rest of the country.
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:04.800]  I'll be back in studio, Lord willing, tomorrow and we'll be taking a lot of calls.
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:09.160]  I suggest the war room open the phones up today immediately for law enforcement and
[1:48:09.160 --> 1:48:13.520]  military to call in with the intel they have because America is on a need to know basis
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:14.840]  and we need to know.
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:18.960]  So I would just suggest we take a lot of calls without a lot of guests on this show the last
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:22.240]  few days and Dr. Francis Boyle is on tomorrow with Key Intel.
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:28.160]  But tomorrow I'm taking calls on my show and I suggest the David Knight show and I suggest
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:31.320]  the war room with whoever is hosting that today.
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:32.320]  I know Owen's riding shotgun.
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:34.280]  I know he'll probably want to host part of his own show today.
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:37.640]  So he's been sitting there in the dugout chomping at the bit.
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:40.600]  But we want to take your calls as well on the intel you're seeing.
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:46.200]  In fact, Drew, as you said that to the crew, guys, can you put on screen the photos of
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:50.640]  the police and command centers, massing on both sides of the road in the town I'm in.
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:53.840]  So I just sent the crew out to get photos of this.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:58.000]  This is what's going on and this is going on all over the country.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Okay.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:00.160]  They got the National Guard ready.
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:01.160]  They got the military ready.
[1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:02.880]  There's a bunch of crazy stuff.
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:03.880]  So it's on.
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:06.880]  Now, Zach Voorhees is a major Google whistleblower.
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:07.880]  We're going to hand the baton to him.
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:09.760]  That'll go about 20 minutes to the next hour.
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:12.720]  And then we've got other guests coming up as well.
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:14.320]  Just please don't forget.
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:18.240]  Just as important as having horrible food and firearms and things like that is having
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:22.800]  things that are good for your body and that boost you and your family's overall health
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:29.440]  and DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 literally is on record regrowing mitochondria and making
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:32.320]  telomeres last longer and just doing incredible things.
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:33.720]  That is a first for me.
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:39.840]  X2, X3, good clean iodine, a booster across the board, research what iodine does for yourself.
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:45.680]  We also sold out of the Tooth whitening toothpaste because it has silver in the name, the great
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:47.560]  patented nano silver.
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:48.800]  Super blue is the original toothpaste.
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:51.040]  It has the patented nano silver and tea tree oil.
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:52.960]  Look what tea tree oil does.
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:55.160]  And of course, iodine.
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:56.160]  So that's still discounted.
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:58.160]  I told you the other toothpaste is going to sell out.
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:01.720]  It'll be a while till we get more in maybe a month, maybe two who knows with the crisis
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:03.240]  in the supply chain breaking down.
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:08.840]  We do have super blue still at infowarstore.com and it's not like the food that takes weeks
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:09.840]  to get delivered.
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:10.840]  It's just got to be packaged.
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:13.040]  No, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:14.040]  They're one day behind.
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:17.400]  So you order today, you get shipped on Thursday.
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:22.120]  This week we were to the day shipping, but infowarstore.com is open and it's so important
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:26.360]  to get these products, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, living defenses back in stock, all
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:29.400]  the rape reviews of that infowarstore.com.
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:37.040]  I handed out over to Owen Schreuer and Zach Voorhees here on the live people's transmission
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:43.200]  info wars, exposing the giant globalist, new world order attack, the manmade bio weapon
[1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:48.120]  and the hysteria mind control weapon that we are now witnessing the third coup attempt
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:50.720]  against the second American revolution.
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:55.280]  We will prevail 1776 worldwide.
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:51:01.280]  Now we're going to get some information from Zach Voorhees today regarding something else
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:06.920]  that is happening right now with Google, but stick around, we're going to do that with
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:07.920]  Zach in a minute.
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:18.440]  Since we're on the subject of coronavirus, let's get Zach's take on the coronavirus
[1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:20.120]  and what he thinks is going on again.
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.200]  We're taking all perspectives here.
[1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:24.400]  Zach Voorhees joined by a butterfly behind him.
[1:51:24.400 --> 1:51:25.400]  Wow.
[1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:27.640]  Look at that monarch butterfly flapping its wings behind you, Zach.
[1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:30.200]  Zach Voorhees, Google whistleblower.
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:32.200]  Thank you for joining us today.
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:38.240]  What is your take from all you're seeing with the coronavirus hysteria and outbreak?
[1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:42.520]  I'm really seeing that there are two narratives that are coming out here.
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:48.480]  One is a doomsday scenario where this is going to last all the way through August and that
[1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:51.440]  there will be millions of people that will die.
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:57.960]  Another narrative that's emerging is that this is really kind of a blend of a manmade
[1:51:57.960 --> 1:52:04.400]  butterfly weapon that's not that dangerous, combined with a mass arrest scenario that's
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:06.800]  going to come down.
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:13.160]  So you're talking about the Q theory that this is Trump-martial law to arrest the D-state,
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:16.080]  which is what the Q people are discussing right now?
[1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:17.080]  Yeah.
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:24.680]  And Q's been leaving a lot of clues in the past about what's going to happen, especially
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:30.440]  in the month of March, and in the past year, when he's been dropping this information,
[1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:32.520]  we said, well, none of this stuff has happened.
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:33.520]  What is he doing?
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:38.920]  And it turns out that his intel looked like it was accurate about the content.
[1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:41.360]  It was just an entire year on.
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:47.960]  And now it looks like we're entering into what I can describe as March madness, where,
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:54.840]  and as you can tell, the people that are getting this coronavirus are celebrities.
[1:52:54.840 --> 1:52:55.840]  Yeah.
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:53:00.080]  That's been a odd thing I've been noticing, and all the CEOs stepping down, all the celebrities
[1:53:00.080 --> 1:53:01.840]  saying they've got it.
[1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:06.800]  Katie Hill, who was known for all her verse, sex, romps, and orgies, she's claiming she
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:08.360]  has it too.
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:10.720]  So there's definitely some mystery there.
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:15.840]  To me, I've been saying it like this Zach, two plus two doesn't equal five.
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:18.560]  So two plus two plus one equals five.
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.160]  We're missing that one.
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:22.080]  And I think that's what we're all kind of debating out.
[1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:25.360]  Is the one, yeah, this is a bio weapon that's going to be really bad.
[1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:29.320]  Is the one, no, this is just media hysteria trying to crash the economy, get trapped
[1:53:29.320 --> 1:53:30.320]  out of office.
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:34.760]  Or is the one, what the QAnon think that this is actually some deep state of rest going
[1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:40.560]  down behind the scenes, but you're out in California, though, there's no, I'm in Costa
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:41.560]  Rica now.
[1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:42.560]  I bugged out.
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:44.800]  Oh, well, okay.
[1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:48.800]  It's good for you actually to be down in Costa Rica.
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:49.800]  You're normally in California.
[1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:51.880]  I'm sure you're talking to people in California, though.
[1:53:51.880 --> 1:53:54.960]  What is it like in California when he is big tech freaking out about this?
[1:53:54.960 --> 1:53:56.800]  Are they sending people home working from home?
[1:53:56.800 --> 1:53:57.800]  What's going on?
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:54:03.360]  Um, everyone's working from home, everyone's losing their job.
[1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:09.160]  I personally know people that are in a really bad situation.
[1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:12.200]  They, they, they are losing their job.
[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:18.080]  And what's happening in California is that there's been a new law that's been put in
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:22.480]  that anyone who can't pay their rent can't be addicted.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.040]  And so we're seeing that I think as a stop gap to prevent a bunch of people getting thrown
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:36.280]  out during the worst possible time when there is supposedly a mass bio weapon that is infecting
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:38.200]  the streets of California.
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:39.760]  And we've got a homeless problem, right?
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:45.240]  We've got 10 cities in the middle of San Francisco in the tenderloin and the mission where I
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:46.240]  live.
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:50.120]  And so, you know, if anyone's going to get this virus, it's going to be these people.
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:53.800]  And then they're going to be, um, you know, doing really bad things, making a mess of
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:56.680]  streets and spreading this virus around.
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:01.480]  And so what I've been hearing is that these homeless people are now being rounded up and
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:05.640]  they're going to be separated from the general population.
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:08.720]  We're already seeing that with encampments being cleaned up.
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:14.840]  Uh, anything that's been abandoned, like tents are being confiscated, uh, and stored.
[1:55:14.840 --> 1:55:16.600]  And I think that that's a good thing.
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:24.840]  Like we need to make sure that the streets of San Francisco are clean as we, you know,
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:29.720]  I noticed that too in Austin, that some of the normal areas that have a lot of homeless
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:33.400]  people get kind of dirty that they had been cleaned up.
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:36.080]  One of the spots, I don't want to be too graphic, but basically you could tell where
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:42.120]  they were relieving themselves and there were some people out there scrubbing it.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:43.200]  So I noticed that too.
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:45.360]  That should have been done a long time ago.
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:51.920]  So it's funny it takes the coronavirus outbreak to get our leaders, our politicians to understand
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:53.640]  what should have been done a long time ago.
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:55:58.560]  It's the logical common sense thing separate from society, at least the ones that don't
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:02.440]  want to be a part of society functioning, you know, the drug addicts, the ones that probably
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:04.760]  seriously need mental help.
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:06.480]  You separate them.
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:12.360]  It's funny it takes this outbreak to get our politicians to realize that that's going on.
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:16.360]  But you know, it really is amazing.
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:21.600]  There's going to be a lot of silver linings to this whole hysteria.
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:30.440]  And so you hope that the fear and the panic doesn't cross the threshold of being above
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:35.000]  and beyond the value of whatever these silver linings are, whether it's, hey, people are
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:36.920]  now prepared for the worst.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:37.920]  That's a good thing.
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.840]  Whether it's, hey, we finally got a solution to deal with the homeless epidemic in California
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:46.200]  and all these other cities.
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:51.920]  I don't like what's being proposed and I got a whole stack of the news.
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:56.000]  I don't like what's being proposed as far as some of the financial relief.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.440]  Now we've lost that guy.
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:02.360]  So let's try to get Zach back on because there's a huge development happening at Google that
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:03.640]  I want to get Zach's take on.
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:06.240]  But I mean, just look at some of the financial stuff.
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:08.960]  You know they're trying to crash the economy folks.
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:13.200]  Third time this month, largest single day point crash stock in history.
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:17.400]  New York unemployment site goes down, tens of thousands lose jobs.
[1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:20.520]  Another problem for the Fed, banks pressured as clients scramble for cash.
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:22.960]  We're talking about the Fed changing the monetary policy for banks.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:24.480]  They don't have cash.
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:28.000]  Tied down world of negative rates coming for U.S. savers.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  You know how mad you're going to be when you look at your savings and see that.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:39.040]  Trump's $850 billion rescue plan, global airlines slash fights, flights asked for 50 bill bailout.
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:40.800]  GDP could plunge 10 percent.
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:42.000]  Casinos want bailout.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.240]  All these people want bailouts.
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:47.280]  It's not good.
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:48.760]  It's all over the news.
[1:57:48.760 --> 1:57:53.160]  It's being announced by politicians from Germany, the United States.
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:55.800]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:57:58.400]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:04.800]  Think the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:06.600]  Humanity is evil.
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:12.480]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:17.600]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:19.280]  control the population.
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:24.800]  Now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying Trump
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:25.800]  isn't doing enough.
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:32.600]  What a sickening, in-your-face declaration of war against humanity by these control
[1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:37.640]  freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:38.640]  dumb us down.
[1:58:38.640 --> 1:58:43.280]  And then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly
[1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.440]  admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[1:58:45.440 --> 1:58:48.480]  It's time to expose the scum.
[1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:51.040]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:56.160]  The globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis, but it's not a hoax.
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:59:02.080]  The virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen.
[1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:08.000]  It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue, but the wicked really run
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:15.360]  for their lives when something real is killing people silently and quietly.
[1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:18.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to pray.
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:20.520]  It's time to seat God's face.
[1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:26.880]  It's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in America and the 400 million abortions in
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:33.120]  Communist China and for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption.
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:38.640]  Or God is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him.
[1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:43.480]  That's right, God is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing
[1:59:43.480 --> 1:59:51.400]  Satan and his armies to have their will with the people.
[1:59:51.400 --> 2:00:06.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:06.440 --> 2:00:11.880]  Zach Voorhees, Google whistleblower is with us.
[2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:15.680]  Zach, big developments happening at Google, a lot of big things I think are happening
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:18.040]  behind the scenes quite frankly.
[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:23.560]  But big developments happening at Google, you notice this, others notice this.
[2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:28.160]  It used to be you search Infowars or Alex Jones, the first three pages were negative
[2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:33.080]  press, hit pieces, lies, fake news and attacks on us.
[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:38.920]  Now all of a sudden what we actually say and our actual website pops up when you put in
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:40.680]  Alex Jones and Infowars.
[2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:41.680]  What happened to Google?
[2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:43.320]  Do you have any insight?
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:47.000]  What is going on behind the scenes at Google that changed these search results that we've
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.080]  all been monitoring?
[2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:54.480]  I think some sort of money deal was done, like let's look at what happened.
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:01:02.880]  Trump went and announced that they were going to work with Google in order to help bring
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:12.120]  information about the most local testing station for Americans and also to use AI to figure
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:16.040]  out whether someone should get tested for this coronavirus.
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:19.640]  Now the AI is really simple, I think.
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:26.160]  If you have any of the symptoms of this virus then you should get tested, like no questions
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:27.160]  asked.
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:34.480]  Possibly even if you don't have the virus you might want to get tested and the idea
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:42.440]  that you should be able to link up to the nearest testing facility is not really a hard
[2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:43.440]  engineering problem.
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:48.280]  In fact, I looked at the technical specs of what they were trying to do and I went, this
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:51.160]  is something that I can do as an engineer.
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:58.400]  I literally worked with Google as part of the duty part and this is something that one
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:03.920]  senior software engineer should be able to achieve over the course of about maybe a week.
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:12.280]  The idea that they're putting 1700 engineers on this problem means that it's not just
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:16.480]  overkill, it's actually more of a payout to Google.
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:22.520]  And I think that what's happening is that the patriots are, they're kind of doing a
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:27.720]  carrot in the stick, hey, we know what you've done, we know that you've censored the president,
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:31.840]  we know that you were censoring words of the Arabic dictionary in order to get justification
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:36.280]  for his presidential removal, that's the stick.
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:42.320]  The carrot is, hey, work with us, we're going to pay you out way more money than this project
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:52.720]  is necessary and in sort of return, you stop with all of the censoring, with all the political
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:53.720]  censoring.
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:54.800]  And what do we see?
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:59.280]  At the same, almost within 24 hours, this was announced.
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:03.120]  We started seeing that the censorship on Google has started to be released.
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:07.920]  So something's happened, something's happened with a backdoor deal that I'm not privy to,
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:12.280]  you're not privy to, and we the American people are not privy to, but we can see that
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:17.280]  something seriously has changed with the Google search algorithm.
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:20.960]  We'll have to see if this trend continues.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:26.360]  Obviously, with the overwhelming majority of search results going against the president
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:30.960]  or against Infowars and Alex Jones, it's, I mean, it shouldn't be something that takes
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:35.440]  time to get there, I mean, it's just coding, it's just kind of a switch, is my understanding,
[2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:37.960]  I'm not the expert, you are.
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:41.800]  So we'll see if anything more changes over time, but you're saying the big takeaways
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:44.360]  were, hey, look, the search results are just changed.
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:48.920]  We confirm that just by searching it every day and you see a different result finally.
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:54.960]  And then also you're saying the overwhelming hiring of 17,000 people, I think is what you
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:58.680]  said, instead of just one who could do this job, those are the big signs that, yes, something's
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:03:59.680]  going on.
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:01.960]  Yes, right.
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:08.560]  And the average pay for one of those engineers is around $200,000, more or less, you know,
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:11.160]  what the stock benefits get calculated in.
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:17.520]  So 1,700 people for, you know, that's a lot of man years, like that's millions of dollars
[2:04:17.520 --> 2:04:19.720]  that are being paid out to Google.
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:24.120]  And so, you know, that's a huge amount of money that's going to them.
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  And so what do we see now with the search results?
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:34.960]  We're seeing that 9-11 truth is starting to, you know, be released.
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:38.800]  And a lot of other searches are starting to, you know, be free now.
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:40.800]  And this is a really welcoming sign.
[2:04:40.800 --> 2:04:41.800]  What about the demo rat?
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:42.800]  Did you see that?
[2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:45.800]  You searched demo rat pops up.
[2:04:45.800 --> 2:04:50.800]  Yeah, I don't think it's popping up anymore for like around 24 hours.
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:51.800]  Yeah.
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:52.800]  How they let that happen.
[2:04:52.800 --> 2:04:53.800]  All right.
[2:04:53.800 --> 2:04:54.800]  Zach Voorhees.
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:04:55.800]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:05:00.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a public service announcement.
[2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:05.760]  Info wars as of today is now suspending storeable food sales.
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:07.760]  We still have storeable food.
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:10.920]  We're able to package all the storeable food and get it to everybody that ordered it.
[2:05:10.920 --> 2:05:12.760]  Most of you have already gotten your food.
[2:05:12.760 --> 2:05:17.120]  But the reason I'm making this announcement is all the other major food suppliers were
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:22.480]  sold out over a month ago as we first reported to you, but they lied to you and they took
[2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:23.480]  your money.
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:26.840]  Well, we know for a fact they're still taking everybody's money.
[2:05:26.840 --> 2:05:32.280]  Even though the food has all been sold out, the basic ingredients for storeable food is
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:33.280]  gone.
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:38.440]  All the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up what's left.
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:43.480]  And so anybody telling you that they have storeable food is lying to you.
[2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:47.640]  The good news is everyone that ordered at infowarstore.com has already gotten it.
[2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:51.360]  Or if you ordered recently, we have the food is being packaged and you will get it.
[2:05:51.360 --> 2:06:06.680]  But as of now, we are suspending all new food sales at infowarstore.com.
[2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:21.760]  All right, I'm opening up the phone lines for the rest of this hour, specifically law enforcement
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:30.080]  or military, that has any information they think is important for the audience today.
[2:06:30.080 --> 2:06:35.680]  I'm seeing police crack down, we're seeing it in Texas National Guard being deployed
[2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:43.360]  all across the United States now, cities going into lockdown, what is going on.
[2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:47.720]  Because here's the, here's the ripple to this.
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:49.560]  Trump is facilitating this.
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:52.160]  Now I'm not saying that in a negative light.
[2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:53.680]  I'm just pointing out the facts.
[2:06:53.680 --> 2:07:00.440]  The president is facilitating this as someone who's anti tyranny, as someone who just instinctually
[2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:06.240]  stands against tyranny, call me arrogant, call me a jackass, call me dumb, call me whatever
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:07.520]  you want.
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:08.520]  That's my instincts.
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:09.520]  That's not going to change.
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:12.200]  As soon as the government, I mean, I won't get in it.
[2:07:12.200 --> 2:07:15.600]  I think you understand what I'm saying here.
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:21.120]  If the measures of life and death, which I don't even think is fair, what was it that
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:27.240]  Benjamin Franklin, I believe said, if you're willing to sacrifice freedom for safety, you
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:28.720]  deserve neither.
[2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:31.920]  That's where I stand.
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:33.320]  I don't want to go into lockdown.
[2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:39.560]  I don't want to create a fear, a dome of fear where people can't even leave their house
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:43.920]  or engage in commerce or travel anymore, because that's what they're trying to go for.
[2:07:43.920 --> 2:07:46.560]  Now the president is facilitating this.
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:51.760]  His measurement might be, I need to do this to stop or curve, as they're saying, the outbreak.
[2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:53.320]  I need to do this because the media is going to attack me.
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:57.840]  I need to do this because there's going to be another win because we had the H1N1 with
[2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:03.360]  the Obama administration and Biden killed tens of thousands, millions infected.
[2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:06.920]  When we get the final numbers on this, it's going to be a small fraction of that, but
[2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:08.240]  yet look at the hysteria.
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:09.360]  That's a win.
[2:08:09.360 --> 2:08:12.200]  Or is there something else going on behind the scenes?
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:16.200]  So law enforcement, military, what are you hearing?
[2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:27.360]  What do you think is important to get to the audience today, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539,
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:29.680]  military and law enforcement will go to the front of the line?
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:30.840]  What are you hearing?
[2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:32.280]  Or even hospital workers?
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:33.280]  That's another little ripple.
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:37.220]  Actually, let me tell a little story here too.
[2:08:37.220 --> 2:08:43.160]  So they're shutting down gyms across America now.
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:46.000]  And I have noticed one pattern in these shutdowns.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:50.280]  They start with the biggest name companies and then it kind of trickles down.
[2:08:50.280 --> 2:08:52.080]  So that may be significant information.
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:55.760]  It could be trivial, but that also could be significant if you're a thinking person,
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:59.240]  if you understand why.
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:07.000]  But there was a weird, I always say, if you want to really know what's going on in the
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:14.400]  world, turn off your TV, turn off all the media and just go out into the world.
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:21.260]  And so my spirit, the force, whatever you want to say, everyone yesterday, they're closing
[2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:22.760]  at 8.
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  And so there was this weird thing.
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  It was kind of like the last day in high school, but it was like everyone was like laughing
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:28.760]  about it.
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:29.920]  Everyone was joking about it.
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:32.480]  It was a moment of camaraderie.
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:33.480]  I guess that's what I'm saying.
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:37.520]  So the virus thing really is bringing people together.
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:39.580]  I think more so than it's panicking people.
[2:09:39.580 --> 2:09:42.320]  There are people that are trying to cause a panic.
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:47.720]  There are people, I think, that are intentionally inflating this because they like to get on
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:50.120]  Twitter and get a bunch of retweets and likes.
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:55.480]  And they think it gives them cloud or popularity somehow.
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:09:59.520]  But if you just turn off your TV, get away from this area, get away from the social
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:04.200]  media, get away from all of that, you wouldn't notice anything, folks.
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:05.200]  You wouldn't notice anything.
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:08.240]  Now, if you're in a hospital, there are things you're noticing.
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:12.560]  If you're in law enforcement or military, there are things you're noticing.
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:16.720]  But to the average American who just goes out in their daily routine, you're not noticing
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:20.080]  anything.
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:27.360]  And so I guess my point is that it was a weird, because this has been such an unnerving experience
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:29.360]  with this coronavirus.
[2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:37.160]  It's been so unnerving, but it was almost calming everybody at the same time just being like,
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:38.360]  why are we panicking about this?
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:39.360]  Really?
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:40.360]  We're going to shut this down?
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:41.360]  Okay, fine.
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:45.840]  This is where we're at now, a bunch of a nation of wussies.
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:46.840]  I don't know.
[2:10:46.840 --> 2:10:48.580]  Maybe you're experiencing the same thing in your local area.
[2:10:48.580 --> 2:10:51.880]  We're just sick of the panic, sick of the hysteria, upset that everything's getting
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:54.840]  shut down.
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:57.120]  But the anger isn't really directed anywhere.
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:58.520]  It's not even an anger.
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:05.400]  It's almost like a relief of angst that, hey, we're all in this hysteria together.
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:07.560]  We're going to be fine.
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:12.240]  All right, so we're going to take your phone calls for the rest of the hour.
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:15.920]  I also have a bunch of news headlines I should probably get to.
[2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:16.920]  It's what you expected.
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:20.320]  They're being shut down, they're calling to stop elections, stopping voting, stopping
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:24.040]  all the supporting events, all the leagues.
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:25.240]  People freaking out, calling police.
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:30.280]  They can't get toilet paper.
[2:11:30.280 --> 2:11:33.840]  You've got generational warfare going on over this coronavirus.
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:40.720]  It was just so weird to me, and quite frankly, I wish we would quit giving airtime to these
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:44.720]  moronic young people that are licking toilets and doing okay, boomer videos.
[2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:45.720]  They're 20 years old.
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:47.760]  They're young, they're dumb, they're indoctrinated.
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:49.840]  They won't be like that in five years.
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:51.120]  Quit giving them this attention.
[2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:55.240]  You're only going to solidify what they're doing because they're going to get so popular
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:56.240]  doing it.
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:00.200]  So they won't even, they'll lose whatever notion they have of a political system of
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:01.200]  beliefs.
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:02.200]  It just becomes all about popularity.
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:05.800]  We have to quit going to these people and making their videos viral and stuff because
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:08.400]  we're the ones doing it.
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:12.600]  All these 20 year olds licking toilets and doing okay, boomer videos, they'll be over
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:14.640]  it in five years.
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:17.720]  Just let them go through their phase.
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:21.720]  And then I've got all the news from all around the world.
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:23.920]  The EU is shutting down borders.
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:24.920]  Wow.
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:26.080]  This is what it takes to shut down borders.
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:27.080]  Another silver lining.
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:29.200]  Mexico is shutting down their border with the United States.
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:31.080]  Canada is shutting down their borders.
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:32.520]  These are all the wide open borders.
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:34.360]  This is what it took the virus to do it.
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:36.080]  That is a silver lining.
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:42.200]  So all of this stuff is coming up, including your phone calls.
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:50.800]  But everybody now is understanding on an individual level, family level, business level, whatever
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:13:01.240]  you want to say, the fragility of our system, or more so the fragility of the individual
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:05.560]  who runs to the grocery store to get 20 rolls of toilet paper because they think the world
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:08.040]  is about to end.
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:12.040]  And so a lot of people are starting to prepare for the worst, which is a good thing.
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:17.480]  I hope I never have to use emergency food that I have the supplies in my house.
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:21.320]  I hope I don't have to go into quarantine and use the supplies of two weeks worth of
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:24.240]  food that I got in case this would happen.
[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:25.680]  Looks like that's inevitable at this point.
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:28.440]  They're shutting everything down.
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:32.680]  But we've been getting our audience prepared for decades.
[2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:37.560]  We have an entire section at infowarestore.com for preparedness, an entire section.
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:42.280]  It's like you go into a store and you've got an entire wing of the store that's all about
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:43.280]  preparedness.
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:46.680]  We have that at infowarestore.com.
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:53.000]  And so the beauty of it is our audience has been prepared for a long time with the survival
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.240]  food that we're almost sold out of now.
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:03.280]  But with all the other stuff, survival accessories, outdoor survival gear, water filters, air
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:04.680]  filters.
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:09.960]  They say the coronavirus is airborne.
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:12.320]  We've got air filters.
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:15.680]  By the way, the air filters, I have two of them in my home.
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:21.520]  If you don't have the Alexa Pure air filter, Alexa Breeze from infowarestore.com in your
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:23.920]  house, I'm telling you, you're nuts.
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:28.880]  Especially if you have cats or dogs or any pet at all, really.
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:35.560]  Even if you have a rare creature like a Salkata tortoise, pets emit odors.
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:37.600]  They stink.
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:39.520]  I'm telling you, you might say, oh, that's crazy.
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:40.520]  That doesn't add up.
[2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:41.760]  Really?
[2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:44.800]  Your air purifier is stopping pet odors?
[2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:46.200]  Yeah, it does.
[2:14:46.200 --> 2:14:52.080]  And quite frankly, when you remove the screener, see, there's multiple levels of filtration
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:54.440]  on the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:56.320]  The crew may be able to pull it up.
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:03.400]  The first filter is just a normal filter that you can take off and remove and clean.
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.880]  You're going to be disgusted, quite frankly, when you have to clean your filter.
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:11.000]  You're going to be like, this is the air in my house.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:12.080]  This is the dust.
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:13.480]  This is the muck.
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:14.480]  This is the buildup.
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:15.840]  That's in your home.
[2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:18.640]  You're breathing that.
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:22.920]  It's like if the sun shines right in through the window and you can see all the floaties
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:26.520]  and all the dust and all that stuff, yeah, you're breathing that.
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.080]  You're cutting down on that with the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter.
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:32.880]  You'll notice the fresher air.
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:36.360]  You'll notice the pet odors are gone.
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:39.080]  Try it for yourself at infowarsstore.com, Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:40.800]  In fact, guys, pull that back up.
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:41.800]  Was that on sale?
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:42.800]  I must have missed this.
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:45.800]  I think we have it even on sale discounted right now.
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:48.640]  Yes, it is.
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:50.480]  Big discount on the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:51.480]  Wow.
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:55.200]  It's 30% off on the Alexa Pure Breeze at infowarsstore.com.
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:58.680]  Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:02.600]  If you've thought about the implication of food related supply chain disruptions and
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:06.760]  are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:08.120]  will ever hear.
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:09.120]  Here's why.
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:13.040]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:18.240]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:21.080]  are just a few days away here in the U.S.
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:26.240]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:29.320]  heirloom seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[2:16:29.320 --> 2:16:34.200]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:36.120]  most important thing you do.
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:41.600]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:43.560]  This could be life-saving.
[2:16:43.560 --> 2:16:46.120]  Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.
[2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:47.920]  Get free bonus seeds.
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:49.560]  Special quarantine reports too.
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:51.960]  Go to survivalseedbank.com.
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:55.160]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:58.200]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:01.200]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:06.040]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected,
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:08.440]  everybody sees your information.
[2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:13.480]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[2:18:56.080 --> 2:18:57.560]  It's all over the news.
[2:18:57.560 --> 2:19:02.000]  It's being announced by politicians from Germany and the United States.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.600]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:07.160]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:13.600]  Look at the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:15.400]  Humanity is evil.
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:21.280]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:26.400]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:28.080]  control the population.
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:33.000]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:34.680]  Trump isn't doing enough.
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:41.400]  Is that a sickening, in-your-face declaration of war against humanity by these control
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:46.440]  freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:51.440]  dumb us down, and then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when
[2:19:51.440 --> 2:19:54.240]  they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[2:19:54.240 --> 2:20:21.360]  It's time to expose the scum.
[2:20:21.360 --> 2:20:31.120]  Alright, as usual, we've got the best callers coming up here.
[2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:33.720]  A lot of military, a lot of law enforcement.
[2:20:33.720 --> 2:20:37.360]  I will be hosting the first hour of the war room today.
[2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:39.920]  Tom Papert will take over from there, but I wanted to let you know I've got another
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:42.240]  great guest coming up, Richard Reeves.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:44.200]  We're hearing all the angles, folks, believe me.
[2:20:44.200 --> 2:20:50.040]  With the coronavirus saying, I've got Intel incoming 24-7 and I'm not putting too much
[2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:55.320]  out there because I like to make everything focused on what we do here at InfoWars.
[2:20:55.320 --> 2:21:00.040]  That's why I'm not tweeting a bunch, that's why I'm not putting stuff out anywhere else.
[2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:04.200]  To me, it's all about focusing, getting people here at InfoWars and our content here, getting
[2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:07.360]  the best guests, getting the best callers, getting the best analysis.
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:12.320]  So that's what we're doing here at infowars.com and band.video.
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:16.480]  And so we're going to have more coming up, more calls, a lot more calls coming up on
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:19.840]  the war room today and other great guests coming up on the war room with some analysis
[2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:22.080]  that you're going to enjoy.
[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:29.640]  But we do have the callers up right now and we're going to go to law enforcement, we're
[2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:36.440]  going to go to military, they will have the priority to find out what they're hearing,
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:43.920]  what they know, what they think the audience needs to know.
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:48.280]  And so where I stand is this.
[2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:51.600]  I'm more afraid of the panic induced by the media and the hysteria.
[2:21:51.600 --> 2:21:54.600]  I'm more afraid of government lockdown and tyranny.
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:22:04.400]  And I think we're owed an explanation why this is different than a normal flu that ever
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:05.400]  comes through.
[2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:06.440]  Why is this different?
[2:22:06.440 --> 2:22:08.120]  Why are we going into lockdown?
[2:22:08.120 --> 2:22:09.440]  What is going on?
[2:22:09.440 --> 2:22:11.640]  It doesn't make sense.
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:17.000]  If you compare and contrast the numbers so far, the coronavirus is on par with any other
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  flu season.
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.280]  They say, oh, this isn't just the flu.
[2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:21.520]  Why not?
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:23.960]  What is it about this that makes it not the flu?
[2:22:23.960 --> 2:22:26.000]  Is it a bioweapon?
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:27.600]  We're not getting that.
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:29.960]  What makes it so, what is it about it?
[2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:30.960]  We don't get that.
[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:32.400]  We're just told it's not the flu.
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:35.800]  So shelter in and panic and shut everything down.
[2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:38.680]  So let's go to local law enforcement military calling in today.
[2:22:38.680 --> 2:22:40.840]  Let's start with Claude in California.
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:43.280]  Go ahead, Claude, you're on info wars.
[2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:44.680]  Hey, Ellen.
[2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:47.360]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[2:22:47.360 --> 2:22:54.960]  This question really deposed to Mike Adams to see if this virus test can detect antibodies
[2:22:54.960 --> 2:22:57.960]  and people who have not been exposed.
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:01.240]  That's the case with certain viruses like hepatitis.
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:04.560]  And it would indicate that somebody's been vaccinated.
[2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:09.640]  And the reason for this question is, I would assume that if this is a biological sports
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:17.600]  attack that there would be a small group of people who would have access to a vaccine.
[2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:20.160]  So that's part one of my question.
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:21.160]  Okay.
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:25.200]  Well, Mike Adams is not on air.
[2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:28.880]  And so I do know that they tested the first vaccine in Seattle.
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:29.880]  Israel claims to have a vaccine.
[2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:33.000]  A guy in Australia claims to have a cure.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:37.800]  So that's just all we'll see in time.
[2:23:37.800 --> 2:23:38.800]  Thanks for the call, Claude.
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:39.800]  Go ahead, John.
[2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:40.800]  Navy vet.
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:41.800]  Go ahead, John.
[2:23:41.800 --> 2:23:42.800]  In Kansas.
[2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:43.800]  Hey, yeah.
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:47.800]  I just wanted to end up saying that, first of all, I love your show.
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:54.400]  I've just recently started watching probably about the last six months and you say some
[2:23:54.400 --> 2:23:57.840]  interesting things and I agree with you on a lot of things.
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:01.400]  And you're right about people not getting out to see what the real world is.
[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:07.560]  I've lived on the streets many times in my lifetime on 65 years old and I'm a vet.
[2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:14.480]  So I had a procedure that was scheduled to be done and they canceled it because of this
[2:24:14.480 --> 2:24:15.480]  virus.
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:23.080]  And so far there's six reported cases in the VA hospital that I go to.
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:24.080]  Yeah.
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:27.920]  And I think the VA just announced the first death in the VA yesterday, too.
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:28.920]  Yeah.
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:30.720]  I don't know about deaths in Kansas.
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:35.240]  Well, I do know the thing that I read last night that there was one death in Kansas so
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:37.080]  far because of it.
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:38.080]  That's it.
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:42.200]  And all the other states I've read have like, I think the most was like 19.
[2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:45.840]  I think that was somewhere, maybe California or wherever.
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:48.400]  I don't remember where it was exactly.
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:53.480]  But I wanted to share some with you, a friend of mine sent me this info is from the friend
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:57.560]  that works for CDC that passed this along to his family and friends.
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:24:59.320]  I'm passing along as well.
[2:24:59.320 --> 2:25:05.360]  The new NCP coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days.
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:10.920]  How can one know if he or she is infected by the time they have fever and are coughed
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:13.120]  and goes to the hospital?
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:16.800]  The lungs is usually 50% fibrosis and it's too late.
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:20.760]  I want experts to provide a simple, simple check that we can do every morning.
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:24.560]  Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds.
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:30.600]  If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness, tightness,
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:31.600]  et cetera.
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:36.240]  Because there's no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection.
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:42.440]  In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:49.360]  Seriously, excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:54.520]  Everyone should ensure your mouth and throat is moist, never dry, take a few sips of water
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:55.520]  every 15 minutes.
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:57.560]  Well, let me just pause you right there, John, because I've got to be honest here.
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:03.760]  I'm not insulting you, but I feel like what the way we're approaching this stuff is so
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:10.240]  – I don't know how to say it – free school, kindergarten, low IQ.
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:12.560]  And you know what it is?
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:16.720]  Americans are so unhealthy and drugged out of their minds, they don't even know when
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:18.160]  they're sick.
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:19.840]  And so this is like basic stuff.
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:21.880]  It's like, okay, can I breathe?
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:23.560]  Do I have any obstruction in breathing?
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:24.560]  Do I have mucus?
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:26.960]  And it's like, oh, I guess there's something wrong.
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:29.560]  It's like, that's common sense.
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:35.160]  And so it's like, oh, wash your hands, oh, cough into your elbow.
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:36.160]  It's like, what?
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:38.040]  Like, this is all basic stuff.
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:43.560]  It really almost is a display of how dumb down Americans have become.
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.160]  Common sense is a thing of the past, man.
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:49.840]  I mean, seriously, kids are not taught common sense.
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:53.640]  You know, it's something that you're either born with or you're not born with, and it's
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:57.160]  stupidity in my opinion, you know, seriously.
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:26:58.160]  It is.
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:03.520]  And that's the other thing, too, is we give out pharmaceutical drugs that treat symptoms.
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:05.360]  They don't deal with the root cause.
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:06.360]  They just treat the symptoms.
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:08.880]  So people who walk around sick, they don't even know it.
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:09.880]  Well, I know.
[2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:14.080]  I've got immune deficiency right now, and I'm not worried about catching this thing
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:15.080]  at all.
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:16.080]  Period.
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:17.080]  I really don't.
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:18.080]  I ride the buses.
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:22.480]  Now, to me, if they were really cracking down on stuff, why wouldn't they end up shutting
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:24.800]  down the buses and the trains and all the other stuff?
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:28.000]  And so, John, that's something I've been saying that I haven't understood either.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.360]  They've been doing all the back end preparation for over a month now, or about a month.
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:37.920]  The front end preparation is, the front end of the preparation is just now happening.
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:40.920]  So it's like a reverse logic situation.
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:42.600]  That doesn't add up.
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:44.080]  Thank you so much for that call, John.
[2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:47.320]  And again, here's the other thing that doesn't add up.
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:52.320]  If you're sick, why would you go to the hospital to get tested?
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:54.780]  They don't give you anything.
[2:27:54.780 --> 2:27:56.280]  They don't give you anything.
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:27:59.320]  They tell you, okay, go home.
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:07.480]  So it's like, you're basically going to spread it if you go to the hospital to get tested.
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:09.240]  But to me, this is weird.
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:14.600]  We're getting really childish the way we're approaching this stuff, like, oh, don't leave
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:15.600]  the house.
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:18.440]  Oh, do you feel like you're coughing?
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:19.440]  Here's how you can check.
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:20.600]  Did you wash your hands?
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:22.800]  Did you cough into your elbow?
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:29.760]  Oh, here's a nice pad on the head and a cookie because you used hand sanitizer before you
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:33.360]  touched the rail at the train station.
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:34.880]  Oh, good for you.
[2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:36.120]  Here's a pad on the head.
[2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:38.560]  Now take a deep breath.
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:41.040]  Was there any obstruction?
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:42.600]  Was that a clean breath of air?
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:46.720]  If not, now follow the next three steps to find out if you may or may not be sick.
[2:28:46.720 --> 2:28:51.040]  It's like in the first Lego movie where they have the checklist of stuff they have to do
[2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:52.720]  every morning and they wake up.
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:53.720]  No thanks.
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:54.720]  I'm an American.
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:55.720]  I'm good.
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:59.720]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:01.640]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:01.640 --> 2:29:03.360]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:08.800]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:09.920]  my life.
[2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:15.160]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:19.760]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:23.480]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:23.480 --> 2:29:28.200]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:28.200 --> 2:29:30.520]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:30.520 --> 2:29:35.720]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:39.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  Get clean.
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.040]  Call now and learn more.
[2:29:42.040 --> 2:29:56.240]  800-506-6740-800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:56.240 --> 2:30:00.760]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about, because there's
[2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:05.760]  so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it, it takes a long time to break down
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:08.160]  the product because it's a complex product.
[2:30:08.160 --> 2:30:14.120]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth through your throat and lungs are really thin.
[2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:17.200]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you want to do essential oils.
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:18.480]  Not our lung cleanse.
[2:30:18.480 --> 2:30:25.480]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:31.880]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale, and it just does so much for me when
[2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:36.080]  I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:40.120]  It's just very, very soothing and it's just one more thing for you and your family to
[2:30:40.120 --> 2:30:43.840]  have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:49.720]  Get your lung cleanse discounted at InfowarsStore.com and get yourself and your family prepared

[2:30:56.040 --> 2:31:01.960]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the
[2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:07.240]  world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:12.680]  Infowars has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[2:31:12.680 --> 2:31:14.880]  and are waiting for others to come back in.
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:22.280]  We have kept all the products that we have in stock massively discounted 20% to 50%.
[2:31:22.280 --> 2:31:26.880]  The average discount is 40% right now on our best-selling items.

[2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:44.840]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves and
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:48.960]  their families with the knowledge that God has given us.
[2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:54.320]  Be sure and visit InfowarsStore.com today and take advantage of these items while we
[2:31:54.320 --> 2:31:56.040]  still have them in stock.
[2:31:56.040 --> 2:32:01.600]  The winds of change, the waves of change are here.
[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:09.040]  The world has become decadent, the population has become hypnotized and the globalists are
[2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:11.560]  moving in for the kill.
[2:32:11.560 --> 2:32:19.040]  First they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance and once they've done
[2:32:19.040 --> 2:32:25.600]  that, once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the bio weapons, each more
[2:32:25.600 --> 2:32:32.920]  deadly than last as they herd us into the bubble, high-tech control grid cities until
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:38.480]  they finally release the ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate which then mutates into
[2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:46.400]  a harmless bug after a few years and the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers.
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:49.600]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[2:32:49.600 --> 2:32:50.600]  They admit it.
[2:32:50.600 --> 2:32:52.560]  They publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:58.800]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this so remember who your enemies are.
[2:32:58.800 --> 2:33:15.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:15.200 --> 2:33:23.800]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:27.560]  There's going to be some major financial blowback to this folks.
[2:33:27.560 --> 2:33:32.560]  People canceling events, conferences, how do you deal with refunds?
[2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:35.080]  Jim's closing, do you refund memberships?
[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:38.880]  I mean like this is all, that seems mundane and that's a small scale thing.
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:44.440]  Then there's like big conferences like WrestleCon 2020, like $100,000 they had to cancel that
[2:33:44.440 --> 2:33:45.440]  thing.
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:46.440]  They're still being charged.
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:47.560]  They're saying no we're not going to pay it.
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:50.560]  They issued a shutdown in Florida.
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:52.040]  College dorms kicking students out.
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:55.440]  They want to refund on their room and board.
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:58.120]  So very complex.
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:34:03.720]  So I mean basically the Trump administration is going to either have to let, it's not
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:07.800]  even really a recession, it's just a unemployment boom.
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:10.760]  If you want to call it that, it is bad for the economy.
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:15.600]  Just let the economy get crushed like this, or they're going to have to release a stimulus
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:19.080]  package and literally they're talking about giving people $1,000 like a month or something
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:21.120]  like Andrew Yang.
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:23.680]  I think that's what they're going to end up doing.
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:26.640]  I don't support it, but then parties like, you know, it's monopoly money anyway with
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:31.720]  the whole Q and a quantitative easing and federal reserve fractional banking.
[2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:33.000]  It's all a joke.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:34.680]  Let's go back out to the phone lines though.
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:39.400]  Oh, by the way, let me just say this too, as they're shutting things down here in Austin
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:45.000]  Texas where the Info Wars world headquarters is, Texas Tribune, Texas hospitals don't have
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.160]  enough beds for coronavirus patients.
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:52.000]  If too many people get sick at once, oh wow, yeah, and if, if 300 million people get cancer
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.480]  at once too, we don't have enough radiation.
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:59.200]  So I mean, oh, and here's the problem folks.
[2:34:59.200 --> 2:35:03.880]  A lot of people have heard mentality.
[2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:07.800]  So if they just see people around them getting sick, they just think they're sick.
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:08.800]  That happens too.
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:13.640]  So a lot of these people are just going to go into panic or in some sort of re reared
[2:35:13.640 --> 2:35:18.640]  preemptive thing going to the hospital, even though they're fine.
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:22.360]  I mean, I don't want to, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm somebody who likes to build up the individual,
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:23.360]  but let's just be honest.
[2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:28.640]  I mean, you've seen the Mark Dice videos on the pier and everything like you, you see
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:32.520]  some of these college age Americans, I mean, it's pathetic folks.
[2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:37.160]  I mean, there's a serious reckoning that needs to happen with Americans here.
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:38.160]  It's time to toughen up.
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:39.400]  It's time to get that grit back.
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:41.600]  It's time to quit being a damn commie.
[2:35:41.600 --> 2:35:45.360]  It's time to not live in fear.
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:47.280]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:53.400]  Steve in Detroit wants to talk about the CDC putting up job postings.
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:58.800]  Again, it was more of a back end cover or covering your back end and then rolling out
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:35:59.800]  the front end.
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:00.800]  Steve in Detroit, go ahead.
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:05.640]  Hey, well, and good afternoon to you and the audience.
[2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:09.720]  I'm going to try to use as much brevity as possible here as to not take time away from
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:10.720]  anybody else.
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:14.840]  But before I get into my theory that I would like to put forward for perusal, I would first
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:18.040]  like to thank you for being the brave man that you are.
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:22.600]  I am not military or law enforcement, but I am a longtime Freemason who has been active
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:28.400]  in my local community for many, many years and they are actively shutting down bus services
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:33.480]  and all types of things here in here in Detroit, where I live.
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:39.920]  But to move forward to my theory here, okay, they put out these job postings for quarantine
[2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:45.920]  management around late November of last year.
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:52.600]  My daughter got sick with a bad flu that they diagnosed as influenza A around December,
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:53.600]  January.
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:58.720]  So my theory that I would like to put forward for you and the listeners would be that I'm
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:06.040]  perhaps maybe they released a less virulent version of this virus in this country around
[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:07.800]  that time.
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:11.120]  And then the Wuhan version came out.
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:17.320]  Perhaps they're waiting for these two viruses to mingle through the population and coalesce
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:19.560]  into something more deadly.
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:26.360]  I mean, that's the theory that I'm putting forward for perusal for the listening audience.
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:31.320]  So the air filter, the Alexa pure air filter, I have one, I can't advocate enough for that.
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:32.320]  I have that.
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:35.840]  I have the Alexa pure gravity said water filter.
[2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:40.080]  People get these things there because they're going to be a necessity, especially if we
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:44.200]  have to shelter in and hunker down for extended periods of time.
[2:37:44.200 --> 2:37:46.080]  But let's not take up too much time.
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:47.360]  Like I said, that was my theory.
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:48.360]  I would like to put forward.
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:52.600]  Well, thank you for the kind word, Steve, and I do think that's kind of a thing we have
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:59.320]  to debate, too, is I mean, how how effective is a bio weapon really?
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:01.880]  I mean, you know, how effective is it really?
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:02.880]  Do they really know?
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:05.440]  I mean, you know, for them, it could even be a mystery, like, well, let's just throw
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:06.960]  it out and see what happens.
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:08.480]  Let's just release it and see what happens.
[2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  Maybe it's really deadly.
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:10.480]  Maybe it's not.
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:11.720]  Maybe they can't defeat human.
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:14.240]  Maybe they just literally can't kill all humans like they want to.
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:17.520]  You know, maybe it's just constant frustration like, oh, we can't even create a bio weapon
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:19.120]  to kill all these people.
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.280]  So but there's no doubt people were getting sick around Christmas time.
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:26.840]  I got really sick in January.
[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:29.600]  I mean, I think for me, it was look, I was at air.
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:30.600]  I was at airports.
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:36.560]  I was running around DC shaking hands and I didn't eat or drink anything for 27 hours
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:37.560]  before I got on an airplane.
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:41.600]  Probably weakened by immune system because I was sitting in a jail cell rotting for 27
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:42.600]  hours.
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:45.000]  So there's a lot of things here that we can.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:49.360]  But the other thing is like, I still want to continue to draw back from all of this because
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:51.040]  it's just more hysteria.
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:54.160]  It's like, it's just more hysteria.
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:38:56.200]  It's what the deep state wants to destroy Trump.
[2:38:56.200 --> 2:39:00.240]  It's what globalist wants to enslave us in fear.
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:01.240]  Thank you for the call.
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:04.080]  Let's go to Chris, a hospital worker in Florida.
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:05.080]  Go ahead, Chris.
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:07.640]  Hey, yo, thanks for taking my call, man.
[2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:13.000]  I just want to say real quick, I have the Alexa water filter and the air filter and
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:17.600]  those are both just fantastic to have whether you're in a bunker situation or you're just
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:18.600]  living day to day life.
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:19.600]  So thank you guys for that.
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:21.480]  I appreciate it.
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:24.080]  We have a local hospital here.
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:28.040]  I'm not going to be too specific because I'm not allowed to say anything, but here we
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:29.040]  go anyway.
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:35.440]  I'm about an hour north of Tampa and we had a person come in who was showing signs of
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:39.880]  the coronavirus, but they were just put into a normal room.
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:43.520]  And we had a, you know, a cluster of a couple dozen people, you know, different departments
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:46.520]  visit them or go near them or interact with them.
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:52.720]  And then as they got more intense symptoms, they were then isolated, you know, a droplet,
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:39:54.560]  you know, precaution, isolation entirely.
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:56.520]  And then they got tested.
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:02.640]  Their test results are still, you know, waiting to get received, but they presumably do have
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:03.640]  it.
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:06.240]  It's kind of like a 99% sure they do definitely have it.
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:11.080]  And we were briefed usually every day in our department by our director, what's going on.
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:15.880]  And when he first told us this, you know, a day ago or so, he said, Oh, well, you know,
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:18.080]  none of us were in contact with this person.
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:19.080]  You don't have to worry.
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:20.080]  Our department is okay.
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:26.560]  But there were about 30 or 40 people in the hospital who were introduced to them.
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:29.960]  And we have a relatively small hospital.
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:34.360]  And but while the information is coming from our director and a lot of the other directors
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:41.360]  in the hospital is some kind of odd mixture of CDC information and then just general bad
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:45.360]  information, you know, saying things like, well, you can't catch it unless you start
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:46.360]  showing the symptoms.
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:49.520]  So don't worry because, you know, they can't pass it to us because they don't have the
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:50.520]  symptoms anymore.
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:54.280]  Even if they're not showing symptoms at all yet, the other workers you're exposed.
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:58.120]  But you know, today we just got told that we do have some people in our department who
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:40:59.120]  were exposed.
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:01.480]  Some of our older people, some are younger people.
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:06.720]  So, you know, that's, it's just kind of a mishmash of people not really knowing what's
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:07.720]  going on.
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:09.760]  And then they tell us you're not allowed to say anything about this because it's a hip
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:10.760]  of violation.
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.160]  You know, you can only tell your family because they're, you know, they're in the realm of
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:15.160]  importance.
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:20.280]  But I know that's all complete BS because it's I'm not giving any specific patient information.
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:25.000]  I'm just reporting on what's going on in our, you know, in our facility.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.760]  So it's, it's all just a mishmash, man, and they're not, they're not giving us real realistic
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:29.760]  information.
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:32.720]  They're saying that I can only stay in the air for 20, 30 minutes and then it goes away
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:33.720]  and blah, blah, blah.
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:34.720]  So it's, it's pretty sad.
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:35.720]  And who knows that stuff?
[2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:40.560]  I mean, that's, that's so insane to act like it's somebody's following a coronavirus
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:42.840]  with a microscope through the air.
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:43.840]  I mean, I'm serious.
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:46.040]  Like, is that even possible?
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:50.680]  I don't, I don't believe, I think that the most reliable source of information we're
[2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:55.240]  going to get on on coronavirus right now is going to be from South Korea, Japan, possibly
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:41:58.760]  India, just because, you know, China is not going to be accurate.
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:00.360]  America is not even trying to test people.
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:02.120]  They don't even want to test people.
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:06.080]  So I really think we're going to have to rely on other nations, trust for the nations.
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:11.120]  I think Japan actually has it very well contained and they're, they're very well organized with
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:17.160]  their, their, their procedures and vast comparison to America, especially China.
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:19.320]  But it's, it's, it's definitely an issue.
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:20.320]  And I believe we do.
[2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:22.000]  Let me just add to this cause I only got 30 seconds left.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.520]  Do you think without the beauty hysteria and all these people even knowing what the coronavirus
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:28.440]  is, do you think anybody's even showing up thinking they have it?
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:31.680]  Whether people are looking for it or it isn't even a big deal?
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:36.880]  We have people coming in and stealing toilet paper from patient rooms and we have four
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:39.520]  other people who are unconfirmed, but most likely have it.
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:40.520]  They're just not talking about it.
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:42.080]  So it's pretty, it's ridiculous.
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:45.760]  I think media definitely is playing into it and it's, it's, it's not helping it.
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:46.760]  It's just getting their views.
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:50.240]  Since the Democrats are so boring, they need to get more views on the media.
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:51.240]  Wow.
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:55.120]  People stealing toilet paper from hospitals now.
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:56.560]  It's all over the news.
[2:42:56.560 --> 2:43:01.000]  That's being announced by politicians from Germany, the United States.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:03.640]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:06.200]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:12.600]  Think the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:14.400]  Humanity is evil.
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:20.280]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the UN statements, all the Ted Turner
[2:43:20.280 --> 2:43:25.400]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:27.080]  control the population.
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:32.000]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:33.680]  Trump isn't doing enough.
[2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:40.720]  What a sickening in your face declaration of war against humanity by these control freaks
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:45.440]  who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:46.840]  dumb us down.
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:51.080]  And then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly
[2:43:51.080 --> 2:43:53.240]  admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:55.160]  It's time to expose the scum.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:44:00.600]  Our constitutions, our health is our most valuable asset.
[2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:04.560]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:08.160]  And we've got to take care of our bodies, we've got to take care of ourselves.
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:15.120]  And all the products at infowarstore.com have been researched deeply and had been developed
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:21.080]  with some of the top experts in the country to maximize what God's given us, their mother
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:27.640]  nature, to help our bodies boost their defense against all the insane things that have been
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:30.800]  artificially introduced into our environment.
[2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:36.640]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:39.720]  paper or flashlights that you really need.

[2:44:54.960 --> 2:45:00.640]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities in China that then spread to
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:01.640]  Europe.
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:06.280]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city and we see fights and brawls taking place over
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:07.720]  toilet paper.
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:13.080]  People don't need toilet paper to survive, but people do need high quality water filtration
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:21.000]  and they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:26.960]  bodies, ultimate turmeric formula and of course our high quality silver gargle products and

[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:06.640]  world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:11.560]  Others has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:13.760]  and are waiting for others to come back in.

[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:11.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:18.960]  And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Owen
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:20.460]  Shroyer.
[2:47:20.460 --> 2:47:28.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:35.280]  There's one way we can answer some questions, and that's just by human intelligence, talking
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:36.280]  to one another.
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:37.280]  What are your experiences?
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:40.880]  That's what we're doing right now.
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:46.960]  We're hearing from people around states what they're hearing, what local law enforcement
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:48.840]  is doing, what hospitals are doing.
[2:47:48.840 --> 2:47:53.640]  I just heard from someone during the break in New York, said, yeah, I knew someone's
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:54.640]  coronavirus.
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:47:55.640]  They had the symptoms.
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:47:56.640]  They went to the hospital.
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:47:59.640]  Send them home, they're out of beds.
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:01.640]  Guess what?
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:04.280]  That's okay.
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:07.560]  We don't have to panic, folks.
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:10.760]  We used to joke like, oh, Owen got the coronavirus.
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:11.760]  Maybe I did.
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:12.760]  I never went to a doctor.
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:14.520]  I never went to a hospital.
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:19.760]  Was it seven days of me being more ill than I've been in 10 years?
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:20.920]  Yeah, but guess what?
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:23.440]  I made it out.
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:25.200]  And that's not an arrogant selfish thing to say.
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:28.440]  The point is, people can survive this.
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:32.720]  Most people can survive this unless you have a pre-existing condition or extremely old
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:36.160]  or have a compromised immune system, you're going to be fine.
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:42.640]  So quit causing the panic, sending the average person who can survive a flu to the hospital
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:45.400]  when we should be reserving those beds for people that really need it.
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:49.320]  But you see, the media causes the panic and the hysteria.
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:50.320]  Somebody coughs at night.
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:51.440]  They think, oh my God, I'm sick.
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:53.040]  I'm dying from the coronavirus.
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:54.640]  Get me to a hospital immediately.
[2:48:54.640 --> 2:48:56.480]  Throw me in a cryogenic chamber.
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:48:58.000]  Hit me with the chemicals.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  Throw me in a microwave.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:02.640]  I just, I'm going to die from coronavirus unless I figure it out immediately.
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:04.760]  No.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:11.880]  And by the way, another aspect of this, pull it up again, guys.
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:20.640]  The coronavirus outbreak has almost to a T happened in sanctuary cities.
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:21.640]  To a T.
[2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:25.400]  Now, that could just be because these are, you know, major metropolitan areas that have
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:32.000]  a lot of commerce and, you know, travel and everything, but worth reporting.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:38.280]  Also before I go back to the phone calls, remember this happened on CNN.
[2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:43.680]  I think it was Super Tuesday or maybe Super Tuesday, part two, where CNN was releasing
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:52.640]  results before the primary was finished.
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:54.400]  And not just because I worked in TV.
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:49:56.840]  You always have set graphics and chyrons and everything.
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:00.560]  And you do before any live show, I did in sports.
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:05.520]  We would for an hour, sometimes longer, if it wasn't working right, run through every
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:09.320]  single graphic we had testing every single.
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:11.640]  The jib guy right here knows exactly what I'm talking about.
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:15.000]  You'd spend about an hour in the truck before the game or the pregame or whatever.
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:19.400]  Just go, just hitting the button so that they pop up, but you don't have the numbers.
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:23.600]  It's like, if a quarterback in a football game hasn't thrown a pass yet, so they just
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:27.320]  run the graphic, it says zero for zero.
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:31.320]  CNN is leaking graphics with the results.
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:36.080]  It'd be like, you know, first quarter and you show Tom Brady's thrown for three touchdowns
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:37.080]  in the game.
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:38.080]  You say, well, that's not right.
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:39.080]  Obviously.
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:43.640]  That's what CNN is going to be doing, and now it's happened again, Illinois news station
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:49.000]  mistakenly airs election results day before primary showing Joe Biden victory.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:55.840]  Now, look, there may be victory graphics that they're testing, but if this had like results
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:04.320]  numbers in it, then that is something, and it did, it did have results numbers in it.
[2:51:04.320 --> 2:51:11.760]  I mean, why somebody's putting that in guys?
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:15.640]  That's somebody's literally putting that in.
[2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:17.560]  I can't even begin to speculate.
[2:51:17.560 --> 2:51:18.960]  That is just total insanity.
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:20.600]  I mean, do you want to talk about fake news?
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:22.320]  You want to talk about election meddling?
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:23.320]  All right.
[2:51:23.320 --> 2:51:25.840]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:29.040]  Let's go to Susan in Louisiana Air Force vet.
[2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:30.520]  Go ahead, Susan.
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:31.520]  Hello.
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:32.520]  Hi.
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:36.400]  Hey, can you hear me okay on this connection?
[2:51:36.400 --> 2:51:38.040]  Yes, you sound good.
[2:51:38.040 --> 2:51:39.040]  Awesome.
[2:51:39.040 --> 2:51:40.040]  Okay.
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:41.040]  Thanks for having me on.
[2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:42.040]  I'm going to try to be brief with this.
[2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:45.160]  I believe I have very strategic information for your audience.
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:52.720]  Since about 2016, I've been looking for a, what I call a 911 level event to happen 2020
[2:51:52.720 --> 2:51:59.200]  to 2021 that would seriously affect the markets and have to do with food because I believe
[2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:06.640]  that I've seen we're on a 10 year pattern that started with 911 with the takeovers and
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:10.880]  there's going to be a four way of these type of takeovers.
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:11.880]  We're at the third one.
[2:52:11.880 --> 2:52:19.400]  I do believe that is leading us toward global government and the first one started with
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:25.920]  911 and the second one had to do about 10 years later with ISIS, the sign of the sword
[2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:30.760]  peace taken from the earth, that was a huge global collapse and so right on schedule we're
[2:52:30.760 --> 2:52:34.760]  at this, it's a little earlier than I thought it would be, but right on schedule here we
[2:52:34.760 --> 2:52:40.960]  are and this could very easily be the narrative control and the population control that's
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:46.920]  being done ahead of the catastrophic food collapse, but I believe we'll dictate the
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:53.640]  next 10 years toward collapse and I believe we're at the stage of barley, wheat, scales,
[2:52:53.640 --> 2:52:58.400]  that's what we're looking at, that's probably why everyone's mass buying up food that knows
[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:00.160]  what's really going on.
[2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:04.720]  I believe unfortunately the farmers hit their year zero.
[2:53:04.720 --> 2:53:10.520]  Last year I noticed the 2019 harvest was terrible and it's because we're having weather
[2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:15.680]  changes that are not going to stop but it's not manmade, it's coming from space, it's
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:20.720]  prophetic, it's the sun, of course they're going to say it's manmade, but basically that's
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:26.240]  where I believe we are, we're at this third level and it perfectly makes sense to me unfortunately,
[2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:30.640]  just wanted people to have a heads up on that, I do believe this means that we're at the
[2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:33.480]  third seal of the apocalypse.
[2:53:33.480 --> 2:53:39.040]  By the way, a lot of that is manmade with the spraying they do in the atmosphere, but
[2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:43.440]  you're obviously talking about much larger things like the sun, volcanoes and stuff like
[2:53:43.440 --> 2:53:44.440]  that.
[2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:47.000]  Grandsons minimum, things like that.
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:59.040]  Thank you so much for the call Susan, and so she's right, but the president, see, this
[2:53:59.040 --> 2:54:03.560]  is why it's so frustrating because we know what's going on here, again, how deadly the
[2:54:03.560 --> 2:54:12.480]  virus is, not whatever, this is the rollout of global government folks, using fear, using
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:21.640]  fear to pose as a security force, where you hand over your freedom, your independence,
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:26.880]  your liberty, your courage to even walk outside your front door in confidence, you hand it
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:34.960]  all over because you're afraid of something you can't see, and that is how arrogant the
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:40.800]  globalists are in making you a slave because it's all about you accepting it, you see that?
[2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:47.520]  It's all about you accepting it and willingly becoming a slave, that's what it is, it's
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:56.160]  making you willingly become a slave, willingly hand over your freedom, willingly cuck yourself
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:54:58.600]  to fear.
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:01.520]  That's how they get away with it, that's how they justify it because they think humans
[2:55:01.520 --> 2:55:05.320]  are weak, and if we give into this, we are.
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:08.520]  Let's go to Annie in California, I didn't even see this, you say you're quarantining
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:20.000]  in San Francisco, Annie, go ahead, did we lose Annie, is Annie there?
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:28.280]  Annie going once, gone, let's go to Dennis, Air Force Vet in Kentucky, go ahead Dennis.
[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:37.000]  Yeah, there's a couple things that I'd like to kind of go over here, now back in January
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:42.720]  when I seen the first flight landing at Air Force Base level four labs, that told me what
[2:55:42.720 --> 2:55:52.360]  I needed to know, and I started getting prepared, so I just wanted to play a what if game on
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:55:55.520]  you here, can you hear me?
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  Yep.
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:56:05.840]  Okay, now the Air Force, we don't take in regular viruses like Ebola or anything natural
[2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:11.680]  occurring, when you see something laying on an Air Force Base level four lab, first thing
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:19.520]  I think is a bioweapon, and then when I see flights landing weeks later, weeks later, then
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:26.880]  you can automatically assume that they found out yes, this is a bioweapon, now they want
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:33.920]  to tell the president exactly what it is, now the problem with bioweapons is it's not
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:42.800]  really a weapon unless you've got a vaccine, now China's numbers could be pretty close
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:50.240]  to being correct, if they vaccine the people they did not want to get it, and then released
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:55.640]  it, that way it spreads through China and it goes over the world.
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:56:59.800]  Well that would be an major operation for the Chai comms to undergo, I'd rather focus
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:03.920]  on what you're saying about the bioweapon here, do you think the president is aware
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:08.120]  of this because they haven't said anything about this, they don't even talk about it,
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:12.920]  bioweapons labs, bioresearch labs, do you think the president is aware of this?
[2:57:12.920 --> 2:57:18.560]  The procedure, you do not admit that there's a bioweapon, the panic that would ensue would
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:21.120]  be worse than the weapon itself.
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:22.120]  Right.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:28.000]  And part of me is like, sorry Dennis we got to go to a break, but thank you for the call,
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:32.360]  part of me is like truth be said made the heavens fall, folks we aren't in Kansas anymore,
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:35.840]  I think America is ready to handle it, I really do.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:41.880]  It's a man made damn bioweapon, it's probably not as thick as they'd like it to be, fear
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:45.320]  is the virus.
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:51.680]  There could no longer be any doubt, the globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis, but
[2:57:51.680 --> 2:57:58.520]  it's not a hoax, the virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before
[2:57:58.520 --> 2:57:59.520]  seen.
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:04.840]  It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue, but the wicked really run
[2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:12.200]  for their lives when something real is killing people silently and quietly.
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:18.720]  Ladies and gentlemen it's time to pray, it's time to seek God's face, it's time to repent
[2:58:18.720 --> 2:58:25.080]  for the 64 million abortions in America and the 400 million abortions in communist China
[2:58:25.080 --> 2:58:30.840]  and for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption or God
[2:58:30.840 --> 2:58:35.480]  is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him.
[2:58:35.480 --> 2:58:40.320]  That's right God is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing
[2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:46.200]  Satan and his armies to have their will with the people.
[2:58:46.200 --> 2:58:52.000]  Global wars has most of our high quality supplements in stock in our warehouse ready
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:56.200]  to ship to you within days of your order.
[2:58:56.200 --> 2:59:01.720]  Don't go to the stores and battle zombies over toilet paper and things that don't matter.
[2:59:01.720 --> 2:59:04.280]  Get things that you and your family need.
[2:59:04.280 --> 2:59:07.920]  I'll tell you how I'm boosting my defense.
[2:59:07.920 --> 2:59:14.920]  DNA Force Plus is incredible with PQQ, CoQ10, look into that for yourself and we have all
[2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:20.400]  the high quality silver products as well in stock but for a limited time and then we've
[2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:26.680]  got the ultimate turmeric formula, bodies, look into what that does with 95% curcuminoid
[2:59:26.680 --> 2:59:32.440]  and the list goes on and on, vaso beats back in stock, oh and by the way we haven't raised
[2:59:32.440 --> 2:59:39.800]  prices to retail during this crisis, we've kept it all at 40% off until it sells out.
[2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:45.400]  Check out all these best sellers and prepare yourself and your family at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:20.560]  Hello and now your host, Owen Shroyer, ladies and gentlemen, there's a frustration sometimes
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:26.800]  here at Infowars because we're like sharpshooters that can shoot like 80% from 3-point range
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:31.320]  no matter how long it is so it's just like swish, swish, swish, half court shot, swish,
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:39.520]  arc from the, I mean, but then sometimes you gotta go hit a layup and so it's like
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:43.320]  you can't even make a layup and it's like of course I can make a layup, it's like I
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:48.160]  don't even want to waste my time showing you I can make a layup but sometimes you gotta
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:50.200]  make the layup.
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:53.320]  What am I talking about?
[3:00:53.320 --> 3:01:02.400]  Obviously the southern border is wide open which just blows this whole panic thing out
[3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:07.160]  of proportion, it blows the whole war on terror panic out of proportion, it blows the whole
[3:01:07.160 --> 3:01:11.600]  coronavirus spread out of proportion, it just blows it all up.
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:18.160]  The border is wide fricking open, a terrorist can walk right across, bring it over a damn
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:25.200]  bio weapon, maybe they already have, so all the panic and hysteria over all this stuff
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:36.120]  that keeps us in fear that we sacrifice our freedoms for, it's all proven to be fake because
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:41.640]  the border is wide open and so we can say, hey, go down to the southern border and show
[3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:45.960]  how it's wide open and it's like, okay, so we send the crew down there and take some
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:52.680]  five minutes to find a hole in the fence at the southern border.
[3:01:52.680 --> 3:02:17.760]  So the crew went down there, we made the layup, here's the report, at band.video, so the
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:23.240]  crew goes down there, there's the border wall and they're scaling it now to find the hole.
[3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:24.640]  We're seeing martial law set ups.
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:28.240]  As you can see we're here at the border wall, over here in Brownsville, it goes all the
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:32.800]  way down until you hit a bow right here, okay.
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:39.560]  So as you can see now we're not so safe as far as the Texas border wall is concerned.
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:42.880]  There was a Border Patrol agent that was just walking by or driving by actually told us
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:45.920]  to kind of turn around and go back around, but as you can see this is about where it
[3:02:45.920 --> 3:02:46.920]  stops.
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:50.960]  If you've got Border Patrol in it, he's actually just right down the way, but looking around
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:51.960]  it wouldn't be that difficult.
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:56.040]  If you've got Border Patrol over there off in the distance, that white truck, other than
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:03:02.440]  that, I mean, they're out here and they're watching, but it's not necessarily that hard
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:06.680]  if you wanted to kind of run right through.
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:10.080]  We just walked back approximately 200 yards from the border where you saw there was an
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:13.640]  opening where there was clearly a gap missing in the fence.
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:16.520]  Actually, there wasn't even a gap, there was just an empty fence.
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:18.200]  There was a Border Patrol agent there.
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:22.440]  The reason why that actually brings up a concern for safety is because here we are 200 yards
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:23.440]  away.
[3:03:23.440 --> 3:03:25.840]  Again, there's an idea school right behind me.
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:28.840]  This is an elementary school or a middle school of some sort.
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:32.640]  It is a school, it does have a fence, however, it is a safety concern knowing that somebody
[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:36.760]  can actually just come across the border right there through the river and then walk 200 yards
[3:03:36.760 --> 3:03:38.040]  to this school.
[3:03:38.040 --> 3:03:42.760]  What's interesting about these idea schools is Bill Gates actually gives schools like this
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:45.680]  funding to upgrade their technology.
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:49.160]  What's also interesting about that is the fact that recently he just stepped down three
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:53.680]  days ago and has actually left the board there at Microsoft.
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:58.080]  Now, recently, we've also found out that one of his employees a couple of years ago is
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:04:03.880]  actually found with 6,000 while staying at his house, 6,000 images of child pornography
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:05.320]  on his computer.
[3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:08.680]  What's also interesting on top of that is the fact that he is now being sued by other
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:12.160]  employees who claim that he forced them to watch child pornography.
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:16.360]  So now that we have all that information, you have Bill Gates stepping down, you have
[3:04:16.360 --> 3:04:22.200]  holes in the border wall, 200 yards from a school such as this, and the coronavirus.
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:23.200]  What does it all mean?
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:24.200]  We don't know.
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:27.480]  But one thing's for sure is we have Donald Trump leading the way and trying to take care
[3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:29.280]  of all this garbage and training the swamp.
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:33.520]  I'm Tim Reem signing off for InfoWars.
[3:04:33.520 --> 3:04:34.840]  So there you go.
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:38.760]  If we were really panicked about a war on terror, we spend trillions in the Middle East, why
[3:04:38.760 --> 3:04:40.240]  don't we shut down the border?
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:45.480]  If we're really panicked over a coronavirus, buying up all the toilet paper in the world,
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:48.640]  why don't we close the southern border where someone carrying it could walk right across?
[3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:51.120]  By the way, it's breaking out in sanctuary cities.
[3:04:51.120 --> 3:04:54.480]  Common sense folks, common sense.
[3:04:54.480 --> 3:05:00.520]  InfoWars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed.
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:07.440]  This is a system-wide problem and this country is facing a new depression unless Trump and
[3:05:07.440 --> 3:05:13.800]  the American people work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation.
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:19.480]  That said, people are calling and saying, we wish you had the supplements in stock.
[3:05:19.480 --> 3:05:21.000]  We wish that wasn't sold out.
[3:05:21.000 --> 3:05:23.680]  They've confused that with the food.
[3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:30.880]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell, we have in stock and we are only one day behind
[3:05:30.880 --> 3:05:31.880]  in shipping.
[3:05:31.880 --> 3:05:35.320]  That means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on a Wednesday.
[3:05:35.320 --> 3:05:37.320]  And that's just as of today.
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:42.080]  These days, we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order that day in the morning.
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:44.880]  A lot of times it ships out that afternoon.
[3:05:44.880 --> 3:05:52.640]  We have everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense against what's
[3:05:52.640 --> 3:06:17.640]  going on.
[3:06:17.640 --> 3:06:29.320]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour here and now it is my turn.
[3:06:29.320 --> 3:06:33.520]  The bloodless coup, the fake epidemic.
[3:06:33.520 --> 3:06:35.880]  That's what I'm talking about.
[3:06:35.880 --> 3:06:41.720]  I've been researching fake epidemics for 30, 35 years now.
[3:06:41.720 --> 3:06:45.520]  I have information.
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:53.880]  Information about fakery and what is being done on top of fakery.
[3:06:53.880 --> 3:06:57.600]  About fake virus tests.
[3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:00.440]  About fake viruses.
[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:03.600]  About fake fear porn.
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:07.360]  About fake science.
[3:07:07.360 --> 3:07:14.480]  About fake CDC and World Health Organization.
[3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:21.800]  So, let's get down to it.
[3:07:21.800 --> 3:07:27.800]  How do you think case numbers are decided around the world for the so-called coronavirus?
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:32.400]  Well, we've got 60 cases here, we've got 50 cases there, 500 here, two just broke out
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:33.400]  there.
[3:07:33.400 --> 3:07:38.880]  And while I was just saying that we have 16 more cases in a nursing home where everybody
[3:07:38.880 --> 3:07:47.720]  was close to dying anyway and we have a 6,000-year-old man who had 500 prior diseases and was treated
[3:07:47.720 --> 3:07:56.080]  with 300 toxic medications, but just before he died he was found positive for the coronavirus
[3:07:56.080 --> 3:08:04.680]  so we're marking him down as the case of the virus and now he just died.
[3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:12.200]  How do you think all of this is being done and engineered to report these case numbers
[3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:20.280]  which of course form the entire basis of the fear operation through diagnostic tests?
[3:08:20.280 --> 3:08:22.880]  Does that not make sense?
[3:08:22.880 --> 3:08:31.840]  You do a test, you say the person is positive meaning infected or negative meaning not infected.
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:35.440]  Before you do no tests at all, you just look at somebody and you say your temperature is
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:38.800]  elevated, you have a cough, you're a case.
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:45.160]  Yeah, but I just have the same flu symptoms I have every year and it's the same, no, no,
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:46.160]  no, no.
[3:08:46.160 --> 3:08:51.120]  In fact, you're not in good shape so we would normally put you in the general ward of the
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:58.840]  hospital here in Italy but you see we can't do that now because we just diagnose you as
[3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:07.240]  coronavirus which means you're horribly contagious so we have to dump you in the ICU and we're
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:13.120]  doing this to so many people that the ICU is overflowing and flooded with several thousand
[3:09:13.120 --> 3:09:18.640]  other cases and we have people from the press in here with videos and they're putting up
[3:09:18.640 --> 3:09:27.920]  stories about the overflowing ICUs, hysteria, hysteria, fear porn, fear porn, fear porn
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:35.760]  and now how many people have actually died according to official statistics in Italy
[3:09:35.760 --> 3:09:40.000]  from the so-called coronavirus?
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:49.960]  Maybe five, maybe two, maybe because they're all old, they all have long-term health conditions
[3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:55.080]  and as confessed by the head of an Italian Health Institute which I posted at No More
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:10:02.080]  Fake News, these people all had such serious prior medical conditions that was obvious
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:07.080]  but that's why they died, had nothing to do with the coronavirus but because of these
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:14.600]  five cases of mortality, 60 million people are locked down in Italy.
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:21.400]  Fake, fake, fake, fake, phony, phony, phony.
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:27.720]  It's a fake epidemic, fake.
[3:10:27.720 --> 3:10:34.080]  Now let's look at the tests, the diagnostic test that is supposed to confirm, now we have
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:40.440]  a confirmed case because tested positive for the coronavirus.
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:41.440]  What does that mean?
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:42.440]  What is this test?
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:49.040]  Well it's called the PCR, that's the widespread test that is being used all over the globe
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:57.200]  where it is available, talk about China and what they're doing later.
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:10:58.200]  What is the PCR?
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:06.360]  It takes a tiny, tiny sample, very, very tiny that could maybe contain a virus tissue sample
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:11.280]  from a patient and amplifies it, blows it up, blows it up, blows it up to the point where
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:17.560]  it could be studied where researchers claim they can now identify it as a particular
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:24.400]  virus or whatever but the thing that they can't do, the thing they claim they can do
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:32.440]  but they're not telling the truth is they say that they can also tell how much of a
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:40.720]  particular virus is actively replicating in the human body, live, real, not in the lab,
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:51.520]  real world, baloney, fake, fake, fake, fake and why is that important?
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:56.840]  Screw in your brains real tight and listen to this folks, why is that important?
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:03.960]  Because in order to say that a human being is sick or is going to get sick at the very
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:10.680]  least you have to show that there are millions and millions and millions of a virus replicating
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:19.920]  actively in the body, otherwise no dice, meaningless, means nothing, ridiculous, go back to, go,
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:30.280]  collect no $200 and the PCR test does not say how much virus is actually actively replicating
[3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:38.440]  in the human body, therefore all those PCR tests are meaningless, useless, deceptive and
[3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:45.400]  therefore rendering all of the case numbers of the coronavirus derived from the test as
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:55.080]  meaningless wherever in the world that test is being done, got it?
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:13:00.120]  So when they say 60 cases confirmed here, five cases confirmed there, 150 confirmed
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:14.200]  there, baloney, baloney, baloney, baloney, completely unproven, completely unproven.
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:20.680]  Let me go even more fundamental than that and here you'll have to actually read a couple
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:24.960]  of articles that I've written on no more fake news because I'm not going to belabor
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:30.920]  you with 15 minutes of detailed information.
[3:13:30.920 --> 3:13:36.600]  Did the Chinese researchers ever discover a new virus in the first place which they
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:43.840]  eventually called COV or COV-19 or COVID-19 or the coronavirus?
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:52.200]  Did they actually ever really do the correct procedures by which researchers say they discovered
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:54.360]  a new virus?
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:14:01.160]  I see no evidence that they did nor do I see any evidence that the CDC did or the World
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:09.480]  Health Organization did or the National Institutes of Health did or anybody did because the best
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:15.600]  and the closest way that you would do procedure to say that you discovered a new virus is
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:23.240]  you would use something called an electron microscope photograph called an EM.
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:28.560]  If they did that at all and I see a few photographs here and there, you would have to do that
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:34.720]  on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, several thousand patients who have been diagnosed with
[3:14:34.720 --> 3:14:42.520]  the new disease to prove that you've actually found a new virus and I see absolutely zero
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:45.800]  evidence that that has been done at all.
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:57.680]  Or even the original discovery of the so-called coronavirus is in heavy, heavy, heavy doubt.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:05.880]  So all of the conversation and discussion and claims about this lab doing this to the
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:10.240]  virus and that lab doing that to the virus and they took the virus here and they sent
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:14.520]  it there and they tweaked it and they weaponized it in here.
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:19.640]  Look at what we found in the genetic sequence and whatever, whatever, whatever.
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:24.720]  I'm undercutting all of that and asking the basic question, did they ever in the first
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:30.200]  place discover a new virus?
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:36.920]  And did they ever come up with a diagnostic test that would correctly indicate that somebody
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:40.720]  is sick or is going to get sick?
[3:15:40.720 --> 3:15:52.200]  And the answer to both those questions at this time is NO, fake, fake, fake, fake.
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:53.200]  See you on the other side.
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:15:54.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:58.440]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:00.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:02.960]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:02.960 --> 3:16:06.240]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:06.240 --> 3:16:08.480]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:09.800]  I can help you too.
[3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:12.800]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:15.040]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:22.880]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:28.240]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:29.240]  the world.
[3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:32.280]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:32.280 --> 3:16:38.240]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:42.040]  As former colony the U.S. had to save the empire.
[3:16:42.040 --> 3:16:43.040]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:44.600]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:51.160]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available
[3:16:51.160 --> 3:16:53.200]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:53.200 --> 3:16:56.240]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:56.920]  There could no longer be any doubt.
[3:17:56.920 --> 3:18:02.040]  The globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis, but it's not a hoax.
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:08.000]  The virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen.
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:13.880]  It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue, but the wicked really run
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:21.240]  for their lives when something real is killing people silently and quietly.
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:23.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to pray.
[3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:26.400]  It's time to seek God's face.
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:32.760]  It's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in America and the 400 million abortions in
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:39.000]  Communist China and for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:44.520]  Or God is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him.
[3:18:44.520 --> 3:18:45.520]  That's right.
[3:18:45.520 --> 3:18:50.880]  God is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing Satan and his
[3:18:50.880 --> 3:18:53.840]  armies to have their will with the people.
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:18:59.720]  It's all over the news. It's being announced by politicians from Germany, the United States.
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:02.360]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:04.920]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:11.320]  Think the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:13.120]  Humanity is evil.
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:19.000]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:24.120]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and
[3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:25.760]  control the population.
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:30.720]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying
[3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:32.400]  Trump isn't doing enough.
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:39.440]  What a sickening in your face declaration of war against humanity by these control freaks
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:44.160]  who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:49.800]  dumb us down and when we resist call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly
[3:19:49.800 --> 3:19:51.960]  admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:57.360]  It's time to expose the scum.
[3:19:57.360 --> 3:20:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:33.360]  And now your host, John Rappaport, John Rappaport here sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour
[3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:36.520]  talking about the diagnostic tests.
[3:20:36.520 --> 3:20:37.520]  Let's go to China.
[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:43.440]  What are they doing there in order to say that there are however many thousands of cases
[3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:45.280]  of the coronavirus and so forth?
[3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:50.880]  Well, a month or two back, they suddenly announced, you know what we're doing in China?
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:57.920]  CT scans, CAT scans, what, yep, of the lungs.
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:21:05.440]  And if we find evidence of pneumonia, that's a case of the coronavirus.
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:08.280]  I mean, who are they kidding?
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:15.400]  Any doctor, any medical student, any medical, pre-medical student in high school would
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:21.480]  be able to immediately reject that idea as being completely insane and irrelevant.
[3:21:21.480 --> 3:21:28.360]  Doing a CAT scan, a CT scan for pneumonia and you're saying that if it comes up positive,
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:33.080]  you're going to diagnose this person with the case of the coronavirus when pneumonia
[3:21:33.080 --> 3:21:39.320]  can be caused by 50 different things, even horrible air pollution that has nothing to
[3:21:39.320 --> 3:21:41.600]  do with the germ whatsoever.
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:46.840]  And gee whiz, as a matter of fact, in Wuhan, China, maybe you've heard of that city, they
[3:21:46.840 --> 3:21:51.920]  have an enormous amount of unprecedented toxic air pollution that they've had there for years
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:53.840]  and years and years.
[3:21:53.840 --> 3:22:00.240]  And when I say unprecedented, I mean a mix of toxic elements together that have never
[3:22:00.240 --> 3:22:07.840]  before been seen at one time together in the history of humanity.
[3:22:07.840 --> 3:22:12.720]  And people are going around pre-coronavirus wearing masks.
[3:22:12.720 --> 3:22:15.000]  Can I see through the haze?
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:19.880]  There were street protests in several Chinese cities last summer.
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:23.120]  Protests against the dictatorship there.
[3:22:23.120 --> 3:22:27.800]  You don't do those things lightly like you would in the United States.
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:34.760]  All kinds of people in those protests, including middle-classers and so on, what are they protesting?
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:42.720]  The horrendous disease causing air quality, that's what they're talking about.
[3:22:42.720 --> 3:22:50.080]  And you also know that in China, studies indicate a good estimate would be 300,000 people in
[3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:58.680]  China die every year from pneumonia, way back before the emergence of the fake coronavirus.
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:04.760]  So now all of these people and more with pneumonia, anybody could be, oh yeah, I can't
[3:23:04.760 --> 3:23:10.400]  scan, sure, let's call it coronavirus.
[3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:13.720]  Absolutely insane.
[3:23:13.720 --> 3:23:20.200]  But the key here, folks, the key kickoff to this whole episode of gigantic fear on the
[3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:25.400]  back of which we're seeing all the lockdowns, the shutdowns, the quarantines, the economic
[3:23:25.400 --> 3:23:34.400]  devastation, the attack on human life was the one thing the Chinese government did about
[3:23:34.400 --> 3:23:40.440]  five minutes after the heads got together and said we're going to call this whole business
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:42.920]  a virus.
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:50.280]  The Chinese locked down three cities and 50 million people overnight, bang.
[3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:59.160]  That was the kickoff because you see, because you see, that gave the pretext for the CDC,
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:03.800]  the World Health Organization, governments around the world to say, oh dear, this is
[3:24:03.800 --> 3:24:06.040]  terribly serious.
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:10.960]  We have to contain the spread of the virus, look what the Chinese did, they're brilliant,
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:11.960]  they're wonderful.
[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:18.520]  Now down to the Chinese, what a model of control to contain the virus, yes, marvelous, we're
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:20.480]  going to have to do the same thing.
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:27.800]  And by the way, this means the lockdown in China is all the evidence anybody could ask
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:33.640]  for as to how dangerous this whole business is of the coronavirus.
[3:24:33.640 --> 3:24:35.720]  And that was the kickoff.
[3:24:35.720 --> 3:24:43.720]  And that led to what we're seeing now in Italy, in cities in the United States, in Australia
[3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:47.960]  and other places.
[3:24:47.960 --> 3:24:53.200]  Lockdown, shutdown, don't go out of your house, except to go to your pharmacy and pick up
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:58.120]  your medical drugs from your neighborhood dealer, jog a couple of blocks.
[3:24:58.120 --> 3:25:05.680]  If you have to work not from home, if you're one of the great unwashed who has to actually
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:11.440]  go outside the house to go to work, and you're not an information worker who can work from
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:19.520]  home, then run very quickly, don't talk to anybody and touch no one.
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:30.080]  New York, San Francisco, mayors, governors, insane lunatics that are aiding and abetting
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:38.280]  this economic devastation and attack on economies, which is right out of the elite Rockefeller
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:47.360]  globalist playbook, of course, wreck economies making nations easier to take over.
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:53.960]  I would say that since about 1987, I've been telling people and writing that the most dangerous
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:26:01.720]  of the cartels long term on this planet is the medical cartel and here we are.
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:05.400]  They know how to stage a fake show.
[3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:08.160]  They understand how to do that.
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:12.880]  They can even box in a president, which they've done.
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:20.720]  Check, double check, outflanked, outdone, outsmarted, checkmate.
[3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:26.440]  The last thing that Trump believes that he could do would be to stand in the eye of the
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:34.280]  storm and say to the medical cartel what he has been saying to all of his opponents since
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:40.280]  he started campaigning for his first term, which is your fake news.
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:49.600]  He is quite convinced that he cannot ascend to that heroic moment and say to the CDC,
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:54.880]  the World Health Organization, the medical authorities on this planet who have wall-to-wall
[3:26:54.880 --> 3:27:01.080]  propaganda built up over 100 years, you're all fake.
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:03.800]  The whole thing is a fake.
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:05.560]  You're attacking economies.
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:11.560]  You're trying to destroy and bring down nations.
[3:27:11.560 --> 3:27:16.640]  His plan so far is to live to fight another day.
[3:27:16.640 --> 3:27:19.240]  Here's $800 billion bailout.
[3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:21.520]  Who do you think that's going to?
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:27.600]  You think that's going to a guy who's got a small retail outlet in New York where nobody
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:32.840]  is showing up and he has to shut down the business and fire his employees?
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:37.200]  Do you think that's going, that money is going to go to a worker who lives from paycheck
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:38.600]  to paycheck?
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:48.960]  Do you think that's going to go to a small business, restaurant that had to shut down?
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:54.920]  That's going to big-time corporations who are already lining up with their hands out
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:27:57.400]  asking for billions and billions.
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:27:58.720]  Of course they are.
[3:27:58.720 --> 3:28:01.480]  They always do.
[3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:06.040]  They're not on our side as it turns out apparently.
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:14.240]  They don't have the balls to join together and stand up and say, fake, fake, fake.
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:16.160]  You're trying to destroy us.
[3:28:16.160 --> 3:28:20.920]  You're trying to take down the economy and we're not going to stand for it.
[3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:25.800]  Even mob bosses have better sense than that.
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:31.160]  You don't think the infamous Chinese triads are meeting now with the Chinese government
[3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:38.080]  and sitting down and saying, okay boys, when are you going to say this thing is over?
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:40.720]  Because we know how it started.
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:43.280]  You said it started.
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:44.480]  That's it.
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:47.480]  So when are you going to say it's over?
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:48.480]  This summer?
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:49.480]  When is it?
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:53.640]  When are we going back to business as usual?
[3:28:53.640 --> 3:28:55.520]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[3:28:55.520 --> 3:29:00.040]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[3:29:00.040 --> 3:29:02.480]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:07.320]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[3:29:07.320 --> 3:29:10.840]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:10.840 --> 3:29:15.360]  We hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:29:15.360 --> 3:29:16.360]  across America.
[3:29:16.360 --> 3:29:20.280]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:29:20.280 --> 3:29:23.920]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:24.920]  healthier I feel.
[3:29:24.920 --> 3:29:27.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:32.760]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[3:29:32.760 --> 3:29:35.240]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:29:54.120 --> 3:30:00.160]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the
[3:30:00.160 --> 3:30:05.360]  world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:10.800]  Info wars has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[3:30:10.800 --> 3:30:13.000]  and are waiting for others to come back in.

[3:32:04.920 --> 3:32:11.320]  We've got to take care of ourselves, and all the products at infowarstore.com have been
[3:32:11.320 --> 3:32:16.960]  researched deeply and have been developed with some of the top experts in the country
[3:32:16.960 --> 3:32:24.080]  to maximize what God's given us through Mother Nature, to help our bodies boost their defense
[3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:29.640]  against all the insane things that have been artificially introduced into our environment.
[3:32:29.640 --> 3:32:35.480]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet
[3:32:35.480 --> 3:32:38.520]  paper or flashlights that you really need.
[3:32:38.520 --> 3:32:44.120]  Sure, it's okay to have plenty of that, but it is high quality supplements, and we've
[3:32:44.120 --> 3:32:45.400]  got the best.
[3:32:45.400 --> 3:32:57.400]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything, 40% at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:57.400 --> 3:33:15.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:15.800 --> 3:33:42.440]  Now, I missed all this incredible fakery, fake virus, fake tests, fake case numbers, fake
[3:33:42.440 --> 3:33:49.000]  fear, which turns out to be real fear when people buy it.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:34:00.280]  If the vaccines come along, as I have mentioned, I don't know, 6,000 times, that's the hammer.
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:07.680]  Now there are two experimental technologies for vaccines in the pipeline.
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:13.680]  One is in a clinical trial right now, humans, good luck.
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:18.320]  Want to describe these very briefly, so if you hear about this, you'll understand something.
[3:34:18.320 --> 3:34:22.760]  One is called DNA vaccines.
[3:34:22.760 --> 3:34:29.520]  They don't put a germ or virus into the vaccine in order to so-called stimulate the immune
[3:34:29.520 --> 3:34:30.520]  system.
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:34.880]  Instead, they put a synthesized gene in there.
[3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:39.400]  So in other words, it's really gene therapy, it's not a vaccine at all.
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:44.000]  They call it a vaccine, they call it DNA vaccines.
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:50.680]  I've quoted this, cited this in articles, New York Times article from 2015 in the spring.
[3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:56.840]  The DNA vaccine will permanently, get this now, permanently alter the genetic makeup
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:35:02.680]  of the person who receives the vaccine, permanently.
[3:35:02.680 --> 3:35:08.600]  And in that New York Times article, they interviewed a distinguished Nobel laureate, Dr. David
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:12.000]  Baltimore, and they asked him what he thought about this very interesting.
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  He said, you could see how some people might be leery of the idea of changing their genetic
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  makeup.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  Do you think?
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  Possible?
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:30.760]  Permanently, in unknown ways, DNA vaccines.
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:32.440]  Keep your eye on that phrase.
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:35.000]  The other one is RNA vaccine.
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:45.240]  Now, that whole idea has the distinct possibility and challenge, as you can find in many mainstream
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:53.360]  sources, that it could provoke what's called an autoimmune reaction.
[3:35:53.360 --> 3:36:01.160]  That basically means the body goes to war against itself, or some vital aspect of itself.
[3:36:01.160 --> 3:36:07.800]  Because the immune system gets confused, gets screwed up, goes out of control, begins treating
[3:36:07.800 --> 3:36:16.320]  part of the body or some aspect of the body as if it were an enemy, an invader.
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:19.600]  That's not good, certainly not.
[3:36:19.600 --> 3:36:23.160]  That would be RNA vaccines.
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:26.640]  Watch those two terms.
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:36.240]  Watch out for any vaccines that may be brought to market and could be mandated for the population
[3:36:36.240 --> 3:36:44.160]  to, quote, prevent fake illness from fake virus.
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:45.400]  I want to tell you a story now.
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:47.600]  I think we have some time here.
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:53.920]  I want you to listen very carefully because this is what's called a prior illustration.
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:55.840]  This is what's called history.
[3:36:55.840 --> 3:37:02.360]  This is what's called, they did this before and look at what they did and why I might
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:08.360]  be talking about fake this and fake that and fake this.
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:14.600]  I want to take you back to the Stone Age called 2009 and the swine flu epidemic, which some
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:15.600]  of you may remember.
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:20.760]  Oh, that was another one that was going to take over the world and destroy half the population.
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:23.200]  The virus, the virus, the virus.
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:24.200]  Yes.
[3:37:24.200 --> 3:37:29.720]  People even then believe me and I've quoted in articles, this is not just a virus, this
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:30.720]  is a bioweapon.
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:32.480]  This has been engineered in a lab.
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:34.560]  This has been tweaked to destroy.
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:38.240]  There's no defense against it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:48.800]  and it turns out to be another dud, dud, fake, phony 2009.
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:52.680]  Where was this one start?
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:54.480]  How did this one come about?
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:57.080]  Well, there was a farm in Mexico.
[3:37:57.080 --> 3:37:58.680]  It's not actually a farm.
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:03.920]  It's a giant, what would you call it, pig factory, about a million pigs.
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:04.920]  Yes.
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:12.920]  And you see at these giant commercial pig farms, they have a funny practice of allowing urine
[3:38:12.920 --> 3:38:19.440]  and pig feces to just run out into the open, into the landscape and form what they actually
[3:38:19.440 --> 3:38:25.120]  call feces lagoons that you can see from outer space.
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:26.720]  They are so large.
[3:38:26.720 --> 3:38:32.080]  And then on top of that incredible toxicity, and you've got workers dealing with this of
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:40.520]  course, and there you see some pigs, you've got foam that they spray, toxic chemical foam
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:43.640]  on top of these feces lagoons.
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:49.760]  And so in this place in LaGoria, Mexico in 2009, workers began to get very sick.
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:51.880]  Who could have imagined that?
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:56.400]  And so they brought in more workers to spray more toxic chemicals, and the workers got
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:39:00.960]  even more sick, and a few of them died, and so all of a sudden the virus hunters came
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:06.040]  in from the CGC and the World Health Organization were looking for the virus.
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:07.200]  This could be a new outbreak.
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:08.600]  We've got to find, oh, here it is.
[3:39:08.600 --> 3:39:09.600]  It's called H1N1.
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:13.200]  It's a new, oh my God, it's a human virus.
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:16.800]  And this could be dangerous and destroy half the world.
[3:39:16.800 --> 3:39:20.320]  Yeah, okay.
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:27.200]  The virus as a cover story, my friends, to protect giant corporations who are committing
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:34.160]  crimes against humanity, nature, blind it up, look at it, understand it.
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:35.760]  This is as old as the hills.
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:43.080]  I've documented it time and time again, going all the way back to HIV, using the virus as
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:51.400]  a cover story to try to scare people and cover up, very explain away the fact of government
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:58.920]  and corporate crimes of a heavy pollution, destruction of life, stolen farmland, et cetera,
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:05.680]  et cetera, inducing starvation, never cleaning up contaminated water supplies, pumping sewage
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:12.400]  directly into the drinking water in the capital of Uganda, on and on and on and on and on.
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:15.600]  Let's call it all a virus.
[3:40:15.600 --> 3:40:19.040]  And that's what they did with swine flu.
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:22.440]  But something happened in that case.
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:25.960]  Something was found out, something was discovered, something was blown.
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:28.400]  Their cover was blown.
[3:40:28.400 --> 3:40:34.640]  Their cover was blown by a star investigative reporter for CBS News, Cheryl Atkisson, who
[3:40:34.640 --> 3:40:41.240]  late in the summer of 2009 discovered that the CDC had secretly stopped counting cases
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:46.400]  of swine flu in America while they were saying there were tens of thousands of them.
[3:40:46.400 --> 3:40:47.400]  What was going on?
[3:40:47.400 --> 3:40:50.200]  And this is what she found out.
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:55.840]  The reason they stopped counting cases was because test samples taken from the most likely
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:41:01.400]  swine flu patients were coming back from testing labs all over the country with no sign of
[3:41:01.400 --> 3:41:04.840]  swine flu or any other kind of flu.
[3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:09.040]  The whole thing was a hoax.
[3:41:09.040 --> 3:41:12.040]  My word.
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:20.720]  She wrote a story that appeared on the CBS News website describing all of this.
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:24.800]  It was vetted by the lawyers there and the editors there and everybody there and they
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:28.960]  published it on the website and her boss said, the heck of a story, fantastic.
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:34.320]  And the next step would have been to put it on the evening news, much bigger deal, CBS
[3:41:34.320 --> 3:41:39.800]  Evening News, CBS affiliate TV news all over the country and they wouldn't do it.
[3:41:39.800 --> 3:41:41.480]  They shut it down.
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:45.720]  Not only did they shut that down, they shut the whole investigation into the CDC down
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:51.160]  and no other major media outlet in the world picked up on Atkisson's story that had been
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:55.960]  published on the CBS News website and ran with it and said, what's going on here?
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:41:58.000]  The whole thing is a hoax.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:01.640]  The whole thing is fake.
[3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:07.160]  No sign of the swine flu virus in all of the test labs.
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:12.400]  Very small percentage qualified.
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:15.680]  Three weeks later, what do I discover?
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:21.240]  And I've interviewed Cheryl about this, I published the interview at No More Fake News,
[3:42:21.240 --> 3:42:23.800]  what she had to say about her story.
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:31.200]  Three weeks after CBS shuts down the investigation on WebMD and really understand this, please,
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:40.960]  the article appears, CDC estimates that at the peak, there were, get this, 22 million
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:48.640]  cases of swine flu in America.
[3:42:48.640 --> 3:43:10.040]  Thank you very much.
[3:43:10.040 --> 3:43:14.360]  The reason I'm making this announcement is all the other major food suppliers were sold
[3:43:14.360 --> 3:43:19.360]  out over a month ago as we first reported to you, but they lied to you and they took
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:20.360]  your money.
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:25.840]  Well, we know for a fact they're still taking everybody's money, even though the food has
[3:43:25.840 --> 3:43:30.160]  all been sold out, the basic ingredients for storeable food is gone.
[3:43:30.160 --> 3:43:35.560]  All the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up what's left and so
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:40.360]  anybody telling you that they have storeable food is lying to you.
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:44.520]  The good news is everyone that ordered at InfoWareStore.com has already gotten it or
[3:43:44.520 --> 3:43:48.240]  if you ordered recently, we have the food is being packaged and you will get it.
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:53.040]  But as of now, we are suspending all new food sales at InfoWareStore.com.
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:59.040]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:04.160]  world, raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[3:44:04.160 --> 3:44:09.680]  InfoWare has done the opposite, despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[3:44:09.680 --> 3:44:11.880]  and are waiting for others to come back in.
[3:44:11.880 --> 3:44:19.280]  We have kept all the products that we have in stock massively discounted 20% to 50%.
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:23.840]  The average discount is 40% right now on our best selling items.
[3:44:23.840 --> 3:44:30.200]  So stock up on things for you and your family during this crisis, bolster your body, bolster
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:36.040]  your defense, be as healthy as you can so we can all make it through this together.
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:41.520]  But it is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves
[3:44:41.520 --> 3:44:45.960]  and their families with the knowledge that God has given us.
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:51.520]  Be sure and visit InfoWareStore.com today and take advantage of these items while we still
[3:44:51.520 --> 3:44:54.040]  have them in stock.
[3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:55.520]  It's all over the news.
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:44:59.920]  It's being announced by politicians from Germany and the United States.
[3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:02.560]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:05.120]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:11.480]  Thank the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[3:45:11.480 --> 3:45:13.280]  Humanity is evil.
[3:45:13.280 --> 3:45:19.160]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner
[3:45:19.160 --> 3:45:24.280]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and
[3:45:24.280 --> 3:45:25.960]  control the population.
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:30.880]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:32.560]  Trump isn't doing enough.
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:39.280]  What a sickening, in-your-face declaration of war against humanity by these control
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:44.320]  freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:49.320]  dumb us down, and then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:52.120]  they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:54.120]  It's time to expose the scum.
[3:45:54.120 --> 3:45:59.640]  The winds of change, the waves of change are here.
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:07.000]  The world has become decadent, the population has become hypnotized, and the globalists
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:09.640]  are moving in for the kill.
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:16.160]  First they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance.
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:20.640]  And once they've done that, once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the
[3:46:20.640 --> 3:46:27.520]  bio weapons each more deadly than last as they hurt us into the bubble high-tech control
[3:46:27.520 --> 3:46:35.640]  grid cities until they finally release the ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:42.440]  which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years and the controllers emerge from
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:44.480]  their underground bunkers.
[3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:47.680]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:48.680]  They admit it.
[3:46:48.680 --> 3:46:50.640]  They publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[3:46:50.640 --> 3:46:56.800]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this, so remember who your enemies are.
[3:46:56.800 --> 3:47:25.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:27.800 --> 3:47:37.040]  Suddenly turns out to be one of the prime targets and plans for this fake epidemic.
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:40.360]  Shut down this, close down that.
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:43.600]  Politicians scrambling one after another.
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:50.840]  Owners of businesses scrambling one after another to fall in line and sound oh so sincere.
[3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:54.760]  We're going along with this, absolutely you bet.
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:59.080]  We're closing down this, we're closing down that, no more of this.
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:03.640]  These casinos are shut down, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:05.600]  And of course it's the bottom of this.
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:11.680]  I don't know, it seems like in memory there was once a thing that was called the First
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:18.800]  Amendment to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, was it a peaceable assembly?
[3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:21.600]  The right to peaceable assembly?
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:32.400]  Oh no, you can't do that, no because you could transmit the virus, the perfect cover.
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:40.400]  Yeah, but we want to go out on the street and protest this BS story about the fake epidemic
[3:48:40.400 --> 3:48:41.400]  and the virus.
[3:48:41.400 --> 3:48:45.720]  Yeah, well it doesn't matter why you want to go out on the street because you see that's
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:51.760]  assembly and you could transmit the virus that you're apparently wanting to protest
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:52.760]  it, no we can't.
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:59.520]  It doesn't work, you see, stay at home, just stay at home, stay at home, isolate.
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:11.240]  These phrases like social distancing, self-isolation, what are they talking about?
[3:49:11.240 --> 3:49:20.320]  They're piggybacking on top of the trend that's already taking place in gigantic quantities.
[3:49:20.320 --> 3:49:25.760]  Social distancing, flashback to, I don't know, a year ago when you're walking down the street
[3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:30.880]  in a city or you're sitting on a bus or a train or a plane, how many people are looking
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:39.160]  at their cell phones?
[3:49:39.160 --> 3:49:41.760]  In that social distancing, you bet.
[3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:48.200]  Now it's piling on top of that and ballooning the trend out of complete proportions by saying,
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:54.800]  yeah, keep doing that but now stay at home while you're doing it.
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:59.600]  Separate people from each other, isolate them from one another.
[3:49:59.600 --> 3:50:04.200]  There you see those of you watching here, picture on the subway, everybody's on the
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:08.720]  cell phones or whatever, okay but now you people all go home.
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:14.160]  Go to your respective houses and stay there against the possibility that sitting there
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:17.320]  in the train, you might start talking to each other and saying, what the hell's going on
[3:50:17.320 --> 3:50:18.320]  here?
[3:50:18.320 --> 3:50:20.960]  And this whole thing seems like a fake to me.
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:28.280]  They're trying to convince us that we're under some kind of incredible attack here.
[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:35.720]  I'm not seeing it, they're just diagnosing people and putting them in ICUs or telling
[3:50:35.720 --> 3:50:39.040]  them to go home and self-isolate.
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:47.480]  This is a whole PSYOP operation and the payoff, at least one of the payoffs, is now obvious
[3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:51.160]  which is wrecking economies.
[3:50:51.160 --> 3:50:57.680]  Oh, I'm the mayor of Ubladi and I'm proud to announce that I'm shutting down everything
[3:50:57.680 --> 3:51:07.320]  that moves because I'm oh so sincere in my support for containment of this highly dangerous
[3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:11.720]  pathogenic virus, yeah, right.
[3:51:11.720 --> 3:51:18.320]  What about all the people, the businesses, the paychecks, the unemployment, the people
[3:51:18.320 --> 3:51:23.440]  starting out at work, the people who are living paychecks, oh well, yes, we're going to have
[3:51:23.440 --> 3:51:25.480]  to figure out something there.
[3:51:25.480 --> 3:51:28.720]  And you, sir, the politician, are you in trouble economically?
[3:51:28.720 --> 3:51:34.640]  Because of course not, I live in a, no, yeah, I don't come into the office anymore, I stay
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:40.400]  at home building a moat with alligators around, but other than that, everything is fine.
[3:51:40.400 --> 3:51:41.840]  I'm good.
[3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:46.840]  I will lead you through this house, sir, how are you going to lead us, sir, by shutting
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:49.160]  down everything that moves.
[3:51:49.160 --> 3:51:53.560]  Obviously, that's what we have to do, yes, there's a headline in New York Times, New
[3:51:53.560 --> 3:51:57.960]  York City Schools, restaurants, and bars are shut down.
[3:51:57.960 --> 3:52:06.520]  Bill de Blasio, yes, indeed, Billy Boy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy Boy, shut down everything
[3:52:06.520 --> 3:52:10.880]  that moves, Billy, just shut down yourself.
[3:52:10.880 --> 3:52:14.720]  That would be something ideal, I think we could all benefit from that.
[3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:19.760]  New York, many people believe is the greatest city in the world.
[3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:27.760]  Many streets, unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable.
[3:52:27.760 --> 3:52:33.160]  I'm standing at the UPS the other day, this is real.
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:40.720]  A woman next to me has a big box, she's sending it from the northern east coast down to Florida.
[3:52:40.720 --> 3:52:41.920]  I said, what's in the box?
[3:52:41.920 --> 3:52:48.840]  She says, toilet paper, really, yeah, she says I'm shipping toilet paper to my whatever
[3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:52.640]  friend needs something down in Florida.
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:52:57.400]  Next guy in line, she's got a big box, what about you?
[3:52:57.400 --> 3:53:03.800]  Pet supplies, sending it to California, ooh, I guess they're out of pet supplies in California.
[3:53:03.800 --> 3:53:11.280]  Oh my God, it's a hottest industry for UPS and FedEx, I'm sure they got booming sales
[3:53:11.280 --> 3:53:19.000]  based on people mailing toilet paper all over the country, if not the world.
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:24.520]  The brainwashing is incredible, absolutely incredible.
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:32.360]  It's a coup, it's a coup and it's a coup, C-O-U-P, understand what's happening, it's a bloodless
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:36.400]  coup that is taking place.
[3:53:36.400 --> 3:53:43.960]  The shifting of power that remains in the hands of the people to the people in charge
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:49.280]  of the people who always want more, more, more, more.
[3:53:49.280 --> 3:53:54.280]  Which is why the central government of the United States was founded on the principle
[3:53:54.280 --> 3:53:59.520]  of limited government because the founders had some experience in a little place called
[3:53:59.520 --> 3:54:06.960]  Europe where for centuries secret treaties, agreements, wars, assassinations and various
[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:14.160]  forms of betrayal were occurring on a daily basis among governments.
[3:54:14.160 --> 3:54:20.760]  We don't want that here, we want to limit the power of central government because we
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:24.080]  know what's going to happen when you expand it.
[3:54:24.080 --> 3:54:34.200]  So now we're looking at an incredibly intense example of that where a president, a mayor,
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:39.480]  a governor can just say, well, state of emergency, folks.
[3:54:39.480 --> 3:54:45.800]  For your own protection and your own safety, we're shutting things down.
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:51.040]  I'm the hero, you're the victim, but let's see it through together.
[3:54:51.040 --> 3:54:55.440]  I'm not affected, but you are, that's the brakes of the game.
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:04.880]  I still love you and you love me and all that, you know, care and share and all this, whatever.
[3:55:04.880 --> 3:55:06.800]  The government is the parent.
[3:55:06.800 --> 3:55:08.680]  The parent will take care of the child.
[3:55:08.680 --> 3:55:12.360]  The child could become ill even though the virus is fake and the whole thing is fake.
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:16.920]  Oh, the child could become ill, so the parent must take care of the child.
[3:55:16.920 --> 3:55:17.920]  What are we going to do?
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:21.840]  We're going to put the child in his room and keep him there.
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:24.840]  Really, yes.
[3:55:24.840 --> 3:55:26.840]  So let's do that to the whole city.
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:28.800]  Well, what does the city do?
[3:55:28.800 --> 3:55:33.200]  The city seems to be saying, well, you're the parent, we're the child, you know best.
[3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:39.560]  We know nothing about viruses or contagion or infection or case numbers or tests or diagnosis
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:44.240]  or any of the lies that you're constantly telling over and over again to pump up this
[3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:50.680]  entirely fake movie that we are suddenly in the middle of, but we are suffering the consequences
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:53.160]  of it.
[3:55:53.160 --> 3:55:59.840]  But if you say as our parent that this is what we ought to do, but I happen to know
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:06.560]  that in many audiences such as this one, there are people who are more awake than that who
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:10.960]  say no, absolutely not.
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:15.560]  This is not the way it's going to go.
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:24.200]  This is not going to be submit, submit child to parent on and on and on and on and on.
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:25.200]  Absolutely not.
[3:56:25.200 --> 3:56:30.640]  This is not going to be the end.
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:33.200]  This is not the end of the story.
[3:56:33.200 --> 3:56:39.480]  This is not where it all crashes as a wall at the end of a blind alley at midnight and
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:45.480]  the whole thing collapses and we say, well, that experiment failed, no.
[3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:50.320]  They have their experiment, the criminals, and we have ours.
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:56:53.880]  Our experiment is something called freedom.
[3:56:53.880 --> 3:56:59.280]  That's the great experiment on this soil and other soils.
[3:56:59.280 --> 3:57:03.800]  What happens when you institute freedom?
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:13.280]  The other experiment is what happens when you try to impose greater and greater control?
[3:57:13.280 --> 3:57:16.180]  That's what has happened.
[3:57:16.180 --> 3:57:18.520]  That is what's afoot.
[3:57:18.520 --> 3:57:20.800]  That's what's in progress.
[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:28.200]  That is what you and I and everybody else are involved with one way or another.
[3:57:28.200 --> 3:57:30.920]  Control freedom.
[3:57:30.920 --> 3:57:40.280]  The impulse and the need to control anything that moves and the impulse for freedom.
[3:57:40.280 --> 3:57:43.320]  Those are the great experiments and the story.
[3:57:43.320 --> 3:57:48.880]  The winds of change, the waves of change are here.
[3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:52.160]  The world has become decadent.
[3:57:52.160 --> 3:57:58.880]  The population has become hypnotized and the globalists are moving in for the kill.
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:06.160]  Once they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance, and once they've done
[3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:12.880]  that, once they've made us obsolete, they begin to release the bio weapons, each more
[3:58:12.880 --> 3:58:20.200]  deadly than last as they hurt us into the bubble high-tech control grid cities until
[3:58:20.200 --> 3:58:25.760]  they finally release the ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate, which then mutates into
[3:58:25.760 --> 3:58:32.280]  a harmless bug after a few years, and the controllers emerge from their underground
[3:58:32.280 --> 3:58:33.280]  bunkers.
[3:58:33.280 --> 3:58:36.920]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[3:58:36.920 --> 3:58:37.920]  They admit it.
[3:58:37.920 --> 3:58:39.880]  They publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[3:58:39.880 --> 3:58:44.360]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this, so remember who your enemies are.
[3:58:44.360 --> 3:58:46.920]  There could no longer be any doubt.
[3:58:46.920 --> 3:58:52.040]  The globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis, but it's not a hoax.
[3:58:52.040 --> 3:58:57.960]  The virus is real, and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen.
[3:58:57.960 --> 3:59:03.880]  It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue, but the wicked really run
[3:59:03.880 --> 3:59:11.240]  for their lives when something real is killing people silently and quietly.
[3:59:11.240 --> 3:59:13.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to pray.
[3:59:13.960 --> 3:59:16.400]  It's time to seek God's face.
[3:59:16.400 --> 3:59:22.760]  It's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in America and the 400 million abortions in
[3:59:22.760 --> 3:59:29.000]  Communist China and for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption.
[3:59:29.000 --> 3:59:34.520]  Or God is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him.
[3:59:34.520 --> 3:59:35.520]  That's right.
[3:59:35.520 --> 3:59:40.880]  God is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people and allowing Satan and his
[3:59:40.880 --> 3:59:51.720]  armies to have their will with the people.
