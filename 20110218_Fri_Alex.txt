[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:30.920]  Texas Alex Jones we're live ladies and gentlemen Friday the 18th day of February
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.920]  2011 Bob Chapman will be joining us coming up also Jesse Trenadu the
[00:36.920 --> 00:41.720]  lawyer who has tirelessly sued the federal government over and over again
[00:41.720 --> 00:46.520]  to get documents relating to Oklahoma City has gotten bombshell information
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.240]  that in triplicate proves that the FBI was on the ground knew about the attack
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.640]  coming the hotel receipts of the head of the FBI anti-terrorism team who
[00:58.640 --> 01:02.280]  claimed that he'd been in Dallas the day of the attack and flown up there that
[01:02.280 --> 01:06.200]  day though there was no flight records and we know the hotel he was staying in
[01:06.200 --> 01:11.080]  that came out years ago but now there's even more information than he's gotten
[01:11.080 --> 01:16.800]  in federal documents that indeed there were phone calls made to the OKC building
[01:16.800 --> 01:23.380]  warning them of the bombing and he's also sued and gotten in one lawsuit one
[01:23.380 --> 01:26.960]  document from the FBI where they blacked out about half of it then years
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.320]  later he sued again separately and got the same document back but with other
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.440]  areas blacked out where he got the whole document and what it tell us Southern
[01:36.440 --> 01:42.160]  Parvy Law Center FBI running Elohim City and the people that were involved with
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.120]  McVeigh this is powerful powerful information in triplicate from every
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.160]  different angle you can imagine new developments today with Jesse Trenadu
[01:52.160 --> 01:56.760]  joining us on this Friday edition coming up in the third hour he'll be on with
[01:56.760 --> 02:03.560]  Bob Chapman in the last 30 minutes I've been covering a lot of Ron Paul
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.440]  developments because obviously he's one CPAC two years in a row he's winning
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.960]  many of the scientific polls showing that he is the number one front-runner to
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.520]  beat Barack Obama and Carl Rove and Fox News have openly declared war on Ron
[02:19.520 --> 02:28.280]  Paul in fact just last night Carl Rove declared war on Ron Paul on the O'Reilly
[02:28.280 --> 02:35.560]  leprechaun factor and so we're gonna be going over that today we're also gonna
[02:35.560 --> 02:40.280]  look at some of the past dirty tricks of Fox News against real patriots real
[02:40.280 --> 02:43.920]  conservatives they're there with their global warming pushing one world
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.560]  government-loving Rupert Murdoch keep your friends close enemies closer Fox
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.720]  News is meant to keep the globalist enemies very close under their tutelage
[02:52.720 --> 02:58.880]  under their control so that is coming up also US budget limits border security
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.240]  resources they've got tens of billions more for naked body scanners and to put
[03:03.240 --> 03:06.840]  telescreens in 9,000 locations like Walmart telling you to spy on other
[03:06.840 --> 03:12.640]  shoppers but they don't have money for the border even though more and more cops
[03:12.640 --> 03:18.600]  military feds are being killed citizens are being killed it is absolute total
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.320]  lawless bedlam riots going on all over Mexico and there's just not money to
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.920]  protect our border because see that's actually in the Constitution that's
[03:26.920 --> 03:30.520]  where the feds are supposed to be is on the stinking border oh but don't worry
[03:30.520 --> 03:36.080]  if you're a citizen coming back in they harass you intensely but if you're an
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.600]  illegal alien come on down also Horowitz of the neocons fear Ron Paul that ties
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.400]  into the latest Carl Rove and attack they're now claiming that he's an anti
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.480]  semi kind of like if you don't like government run healthcare you must not
[03:51.480 --> 03:59.320]  like black people what does that have to do with ending foreign aid to Egypt to
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.960]  100 plus countries like Israel but oh how dare him try to touch the billions
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.400]  and billions of dollars a year that goes to Israel as we go bankrupt how dare
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.000]  Rand Paul call for a 500 billion dollar cut across the board including defense
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.360]  see the globalists don't care that they're bankrupting us in fact they like
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.200]  it because they will then loan us more of our own money back to us they take it
[04:21.200 --> 04:25.480]  and tax money loan it back to us I hear idiots every day on talk radio and in
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.480]  the news saying why we need these federal funds I heard Austin yesterday the city
[04:30.480 --> 04:34.640]  council voted down what their own board recommended blocking the naked body
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.120]  scanners at the city airport and they said well we need the ten million dollars
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.400]  that the feds give us yeah money they take from us on average said about 33
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.240]  cents back to us and I hear these idiots on talk radio going well the city
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.560]  council did the right thing we need a we need that 10 million free dollars free

[06:11.680 --> 06:15.960]  from underneath Americans at home I've turned in this influence on our
[06:15.960 --> 06:20.200]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[06:20.200 --> 06:25.400]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[06:25.400 --> 06:30.000]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-shore cartel
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.400]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[06:34.400 --> 06:38.120]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[06:38.120 --> 06:42.040]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:42.040 --> 06:47.600]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[06:47.600 --> 06:53.720]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars com or

[07:04.320 --> 07:09.200]  June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.120]  perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the
[07:13.120 --> 07:16.800]  rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the
[07:16.800 --> 07:21.120]  news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition

[08:15.200 --> 08:22.480]  day of February 2011 Bob Chapman with economic news popping in also Jesse
[08:22.480 --> 08:27.040]  trying to do with incredible evidence of government involvement in the Oklahoma
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.840]  City bombing the lawyer who's been on their trail for more than a decade now
[08:31.840 --> 08:36.760]  because they murdered his brother will be joining us with incredible new
[08:36.760 --> 08:40.760]  intelligence that he's gotten via for your request and lawsuits getting
[08:40.760 --> 08:45.360]  government documents and will also review the facts at the FBI was in place the
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.720]  day before the bombing and then lied about it we have the hotel receipts the
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.720]  names of the people involved we have it all and the system obviously is not
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.480]  going to like this information today as we continue to expose government
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.400]  sponsored terror I have a lot of important news obviously here that I'm
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.000]  gonna attempt to cover most of right now and then we're gonna go to your phone
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.920]  calls but I'm not opening the phones up yet because I don't like people having
[09:11.920 --> 09:17.240]  to sit on hold while I cover the news so what I'm gonna start doing here is
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.560]  giving the number out five minutes before I'm going to calls taking a raft
[09:22.560 --> 09:26.720]  of calls then closing the phone system then opening it back up again show that
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.520]  people don't basically sit there on hold or what happens is as fast as I take
[09:30.520 --> 09:34.520]  calls more come in and then obviously we don't end up getting getting to
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.440]  everybody okay let me just mention the stacks of news I have here been Ali
[09:40.440 --> 09:46.160]  reportedly in coma after stroke UPI Reuters they're all reporting it as of
[09:46.160 --> 09:54.520]  last night the former Tunisian president Zain el abanadi al bin Ali it's a
[09:54.520 --> 10:02.120]  long name Zain el ab benedin bin Ali excuse me suffered a stroke and was in a
[10:02.120 --> 10:07.960]  coma in Saudi Arabian Hospital of French Journal has reported and it's also
[10:07.960 --> 10:15.200]  being reported that he's in critical condition according to radio France isn't
[10:15.200 --> 10:24.520]  that interesting the dictator of Egypt Hosni Mubarak we're told is going to
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.560]  step down last week and then magically he goes and gives a speech and says I'm
[10:29.560 --> 10:35.040]  not stepping down now I'm stepping down still in September and then everybody
[10:35.040 --> 10:39.480]  goes whoa there's some type of internal fight going on with Hosni Mubarak and
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.600]  his bosses and then magically the next day we hear no he is immediately stepping
[10:44.600 --> 10:51.080]  down and then now we've never seen him again and a week plus later we're still
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.600]  being told he's in a coma somewhere somewhere we don't know where he I mean
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.360]  he could be dead for all we know and then magically the other ousted western
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.680]  back dictator of Tunisia he magically has had a stroke now so they don't blow
[11:05.680 --> 11:12.440]  your head off in broad daylight like they did to John F Kennedy back in 1963 now
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.280]  the globalists just have you disappear and no one ever sees you again and then
[11:17.280 --> 11:22.720]  you're told that you're in a coma I mean does anybody actually buy that we've
[11:22.720 --> 11:27.440]  got a lot of Middle Eastern North Africa and Central Asia news US troops set for
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.120]  longer Afghan stay boy big surprise every year they tell us they'll be staying
[11:32.120 --> 11:35.880]  another two years and then a year later it's another two years that's from the
[11:35.880 --> 11:42.280]  Financial Times of London FBI calls for backdoor to snoop the web Curt Nemo's
[11:42.280 --> 11:47.040]  report on that it's also covered by Ross story testifying to Congress yesterday
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.320]  they've already got the snooping grids in place they just want to legally be
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.640]  able to use it now in court no warrants to spying on anything and everything
[11:55.640 --> 12:01.040]  you're doing on the internet and also tracking good people inside government
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.920]  and corporate America and worldwide that discover globalist crimes they're able
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.840]  to also spy on them and make sure that different government agencies are blocked
[12:10.840 --> 12:14.640]  from ever actually prosecuting any criminals in government kind of like
[12:14.640 --> 12:21.600]  the SEC for 11 years was sent dossier after dossier by insiders detailing exactly
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.200]  what Bernie Madoff was doing with his hundred billion dollar plus theft and
[12:26.200 --> 12:31.200]  the SEC's job was to protect the founder of the Nasdaq stock exchange and to
[12:31.200 --> 12:36.080]  allow that criminality to continue and now we just see open criminality where
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.280]  tens of trillions is missing it's all illegal Congress can't find out where
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.960]  the money went because the Federal Reserve says they're above the law just
[12:43.960 --> 12:50.320]  another illustration of that and talking about how giant massive crimes the old
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.200]  saying is if you're gonna steal steal big because then if you get caught you
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.560]  know it was you're worth it I mean if you're gonna go for the brass ring of
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.320]  theft go all the way but more importantly if you steal big other big
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.480]  thieves are afraid to prosecute you because then it might shed light on
[13:08.480 --> 13:12.840]  what they're doing I mean that goes back to rules they've had in empires for
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.360]  thousands of years we saw it manifest with Napoleon Bonaparte where he was
[13:17.360 --> 13:24.720]  defeated and captured twice but each time the British Empire refused to
[13:24.720 --> 13:29.760]  execute him because it sets a dangerous precedent to have an emperor and that's
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.480]  what he was of his own making killed because what happened if they got
[13:34.480 --> 13:38.200]  captured what happened if they got overthrown they didn't want to set that
[13:38.200 --> 13:45.800]  precedent where they could be executed so they're always basically marooned you
[13:45.800 --> 13:53.680]  know on a prison island and locked down in a palatial you know palatial prison
[13:53.680 --> 14:04.920]  prison facility basically stuck into a type of purgatory now speaking of that
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.200]  an article I want to get to a little bit later in the hour actually several
[14:09.200 --> 14:17.680]  articles illustrates how in a tyranny big hardcore bonafide real out in the open
[14:17.680 --> 14:25.600]  naked brazen hubris filled corruption is not prosecuted in fact it is rewarded
[14:25.600 --> 14:31.240]  but in a tyranny they get away with bloody murder but then things that weren't
[14:31.240 --> 14:40.480]  illegal before are basically prosecuted to set the precedent that the little
[14:40.480 --> 14:44.800]  guys and people that aren't part of the criminal culture can be thrown in the
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.920]  slammer for absolutely no reason and illustrated by that is the San Jose
[14:50.920 --> 14:58.880]  Mercury news from late last year the AP also reported it DA offers deal to
[14:58.880 --> 15:05.440]  high school wrestler in but drag sexual assault case and if you remember you know
[15:05.440 --> 15:11.880]  grabbing the person and pulling them to the ground is a classic well-known 2300
[15:11.880 --> 15:19.040]  year-old wrestling move from Greece it's in all Greco-Roman classical wrestling
[15:19.040 --> 15:25.080]  it's one of the main playbooks it's one of the main plays it's like saying that
[15:25.080 --> 15:30.960]  a pitcher can't throw a fastball it's like saying that a quarterback can't do
[15:30.960 --> 15:38.280]  a handoff and they arrested him and said that they were gonna prosecute him but
[15:38.280 --> 15:42.640]  then offered him a plea deal prosecutors have offered a deal to a
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.680]  California teen wrestler charge with sexual battery for ramming his fingers
[15:46.680 --> 15:52.120]  into the bleep of the high school opponent during a practice match well
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.400]  you reach it round and you and you grab the person and you pull him down I mean
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.120]  TSA does it all the time make sure we don't have bombs but again this is a
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.280]  sport where it's a combat sport where you sign on to it it's a classic 2300
[16:05.280 --> 16:12.200]  year-old move from Greece this is incredible continuing the 17-year-old
[16:12.200 --> 16:16.160]  Clovis youth has been expelled from school and faces trial in Fresno on
[16:16.160 --> 16:21.280]  Thursday and maybe we should look up whatever happened to him now why do I
[16:21.280 --> 16:26.840]  raise that point you do a legal move they try to put you in prison you play
[16:26.840 --> 16:32.120]  chase now and I see them expelling children who play tag or who bring
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.000]  their own balls to school and play dodgeball see first they ban dodgeball
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.320]  then they ban tag now many schools have banned jogging or running on the
[16:41.320 --> 16:47.800]  playground at recess I see articles all the time where you know 10 11-year-olds
[16:47.800 --> 16:53.640]  are are charged under juvenile code for wrestling I mean ladies and gentlemen
[16:53.640 --> 16:59.980]  we fought every day we played football tackle football every day at recess we
[16:59.980 --> 17:04.960]  we would eat our food in the hour-long lunch in about three minutes we'd run
[17:04.960 --> 17:12.200]  in grab it gobble it and run outside to tackle and wrestle and and and people
[17:12.200 --> 17:15.640]  bring their backpacks and pull dodgeballs out I mean it was crazy it was
[17:15.640 --> 17:20.120]  great I feel so good after lunch when I'd go back to class with sweat dripping
[17:20.120 --> 17:25.600]  from my hair it was refreshing you go to jail for that now now if you want to
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.600]  steal 28 trillion and not tell Congress where it went no problem you want to
[17:29.600 --> 17:35.280]  shoot little kids up with syphilis under a US government program in Guatemala you
[17:35.280 --> 17:42.840]  get an award now here's this new one Iowa girl wrestlers some drama some sport
[17:42.840 --> 17:49.240]  and it turns out she's the first girl to qualify for these state finals and this
[17:49.240 --> 17:55.680]  male wrestler said that look I'm nothing against a girl wrestling but I just
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.680]  can't brutalize her plus he was worried about other cases where an example of
[18:00.680 --> 18:08.160]  this is in judo I have friends that are into judo my son took a course in
[18:08.160 --> 18:18.920]  judo and the first move is to grab someone on their uniform on the I mean
[18:18.920 --> 18:21.560]  just like I'm wearing a sports jacket right now it's basically the same but
[18:21.560 --> 18:26.880]  it's white you you grab the person on the chest and you and you grab the fabric
[18:26.880 --> 18:31.160]  I think it's called a ghee I never took judo so I don't know but you grab them
[18:31.160 --> 18:34.800]  by the ghee and then you both try to throw each other that's the first move
[18:34.800 --> 18:41.400]  of judo I know enough to know that well in competition judo now in in in in
[18:41.400 --> 18:46.480]  Peewee judo in some schools offer it you're not allowed to do half the moves
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.640]  on girls oh they're going to be in the event they're they're going to compete
[18:52.640 --> 18:57.760]  against you but you don't do a throw touching their buttocks you don't do a
[18:57.760 --> 19:06.000]  throw grabbing them by the cloth of their judo uniform you just basically let
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.360]  them beat the tar out of you and now since I heard about this last night now
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.360]  they're talking about expelling the youth or banning him from wrestling for
[19:14.360 --> 19:21.960]  the year and he's one of the main contenders to win so I mean I've got a
[19:21.960 --> 19:29.880]  problem I mean attacking a woman in a combat sport
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.200]  putting your hands on them but see all these lines are being blurred like the
[19:34.200 --> 19:37.440]  military making men and women be in the same barracks and take showers together
[19:37.440 --> 19:40.960]  and sit on the toilets next to each other they're just getting rid of our
[19:40.960 --> 19:46.080]  basic humanity and these basic things that are hardwired into us and then when
[19:46.080 --> 19:49.720]  you touch the girl you go to jail it's like you're gonna wrestle her but if you
[19:49.720 --> 19:53.440]  touch her you go to jail you're like well I don't want to do that okay you're
[19:53.440 --> 19:58.600]  out of wrestling see you don't play dodgeball you don't wrestle you go to

[24:09.840 --> 24:14.560]  all right I'm gonna get into Carl Roben the attacks on Ron Paul when we come
[24:14.560 --> 24:20.040]  out of the next break but in this short segment I wanted to finish up with the
[24:20.040 --> 24:25.080]  nanny state criminalizing all normal activity that's never been illegal in
[24:25.080 --> 24:32.800]  fact isn't even illegal on the books but the young man her opponent Joel
[24:32.800 --> 24:40.680]  Northup who refused to wrestle the girl said that he had nothing against her
[24:40.680 --> 24:44.440]  being a wrestler he just morally couldn't be involved in a combat sport
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.360]  against her and said that he was standing up for what he believed was
[24:49.360 --> 24:55.240]  right and I've got the quotes here his coach came out and said it doesn't matter
[24:55.240 --> 24:58.640]  if he thinks this is more on the right thing to do he should do this we can go
[24:58.640 --> 25:01.600]  on and try to win the state championship so it's this it's this
[25:01.600 --> 25:05.360]  message that's standing up for what you think is right is wrong and now the
[25:05.360 --> 25:11.000]  media is spinning it saying he's a sexist well no if he did any legal
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.240]  moves on her he probably get criminally charged see they do these things that
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.640]  seem ridiculous to set the precedent that government can do whatever it wants
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.960]  it's just like the fact that it's been on record that the TSA violates all the
[25:25.960 --> 25:30.480]  OSHA requirements they don't have any of the radiology regulations and laws in
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.640]  place that clinics hospitals dental offices have to follow they don't do
[25:35.640 --> 25:40.640]  meter test of the radiation generating machines they covered up and lied about
[25:40.640 --> 25:44.480]  the level of the radiation they just call the TSA workers and say you have a
[25:44.480 --> 25:48.120]  problem with the radiation from these and if they say yeah they get a pink
[25:48.120 --> 25:53.360]  slip the next week they're creating an army of mindless idiots just like they
[25:53.360 --> 25:58.880]  let the troops use DU when before 1991 the military wouldn't use it knowing
[25:58.880 --> 26:04.400]  that it kills our own troops not just the enemy it has a radioactive half life
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.120]  of more than four billion years and if you get one with the width of it it's
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.200]  going to reduce your lifespan by at least 20 years they just don't care
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.000]  they're setting the precedent to do whatever they want whenever they want
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.760]  and our children are growing up with bag checks metal detectors checkpoints
[26:22.760 --> 26:27.600]  locker searches now they're told to spy on their parents they're not allowed to
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.800]  play dodgeball or tag their prisoners and then if you are on the wrestling team
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.520]  and do a legal move where you grab someone by the gluteus maximus to flip
[26:38.520 --> 26:43.360]  them over you see it in the Olympics every day oh my gosh the police are
[26:43.360 --> 26:49.800]  watching it sexual assault but in most locales even though it's the law when
[26:49.800 --> 26:54.000]  the TSA clearly engages in a misdemeanor squeezing your genitals through your
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.080]  pants there's no misdemeanor when they go in the pants there's no felony charge
[26:59.080 --> 27:03.400]  unless you're talking about the county where San Francisco was based and we
[27:03.400 --> 27:06.960]  had the a few months ago the district attorney on the county attorney on he
[27:06.960 --> 27:11.640]  said yes I have officers in the airport the San Francisco airport and if I see
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.240]  them touching on the outside of the pants we're going to arrest them now we
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.640]  haven't seen that happen yet though I saw several cases in the last two days
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.680]  of TSA being charged with assault because they're on such power trips that
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.120]  they're starting to beat people up and every day now for the last week we're
[27:29.120 --> 27:35.000]  seeing multiple arrest and people pleading guilty TSA just robbing people in
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.960]  mass wedding rings engagement rings a hundred dollar bills given to young
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.560]  children as birthday presents hundreds of thousands stolen 10,000 stolen from
[27:45.560 --> 27:52.200]  an old lady on and on and on and on just robbing people and it's admitted what
[27:52.200 --> 27:55.240]  they do all over the country they move you into a secondary screening room to
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.480]  do a strip search and while they're strip searching you they go in and rob
[27:58.480 --> 28:05.400]  your bags I have had the TSA steal sunglasses from me Eric Mankal Muller
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.720]  has had sunglasses stolen from him they will even if your bag doesn't have locks
[28:09.720 --> 28:13.640]  on it or they're not locked they'll break your bag open they'll rip it open
[28:13.640 --> 28:19.800]  they'll they just don't care it's all about setting that precedent and now
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.720]  they have TSA with Homeland Security with high-powered truck scanners and car
[28:24.720 --> 28:29.360]  scanners in Texas in New York the headline last year out of Fox News in
[28:29.360 --> 28:34.440]  New York 2000 arrest made by National Guard for drugs guns and other other
[28:34.440 --> 28:38.480]  paraphernalia and it showed video on the news of the National Guard out there
[28:38.480 --> 28:44.680]  under TSA training with huge scanners having families drive under giant x-ray
[28:44.680 --> 28:50.080]  machines do you know the power of those we've had radiologist on depending on
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.520]  the system between 10 and 100 times the power of a chest x-ray and I just saw
[28:55.520 --> 29:01.320]  newscast two weeks ago again out of multiple states in Alabama Tennessee
[29:01.320 --> 29:05.960]  again where they just shut down highways and direct people under these
[29:05.960 --> 29:10.280]  scanners and it showed the TSA people at home they'll have a bunch of different
[29:10.280 --> 29:17.520]  agencies out there regular Homeland Security TSA Viper teams Army regular
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.320]  Army Air Force MPs this is in the newspapers and they'll just stand in
[29:22.320 --> 29:27.440]  there for hours right by the big x-ray system with people driving their cars
[29:27.440 --> 29:31.800]  and trucks through it I mean what just because the government waves a magic
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.120]  wand those those government agents aren't cooking because you're the ones out
[29:36.120 --> 29:41.440]  there getting hundreds of exposures per pop the citizens are getting a horrible
[29:41.440 --> 29:46.160]  exposure as well I mean a chest x-rays a big deal 10 to 100 times roughly
[29:46.160 --> 29:49.880]  depending on which machine and hey you've got the answer just laugh at me

[34:22.200 --> 34:26.720]  report I'm about to cover dealing with Carl Rove openly declaring war on Ron
[34:26.720 --> 34:33.160]  Paul here in just a moment but the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[34:33.160 --> 34:42.600]  800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air today now on Tuesday I made the
[34:42.600 --> 34:47.880]  point here on air that Carl Rove and Roger Ailes are the people that are
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.960]  really running Fox News and of course it's admitted that Carl Rove is an
[34:52.960 --> 34:58.960]  advisor to Fox News on the way they present politics and we see the dirty
[34:58.960 --> 35:05.600]  tricks of Carl Rove all over Fox News we see them routinely interspersing old
[35:05.600 --> 35:10.080]  video of people clapping for people that they're pushing when they weren't
[35:10.080 --> 35:16.600]  really getting standing ovations we see them last year putting a microphone in
[35:16.600 --> 35:20.200]  with the Mitt Romney supporters when Ron Paul one seat packet it was announced
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.400]  so they could boo right into the microphone to make it sound like the
[35:23.400 --> 35:28.480]  whole audience was booing we covered it last year this last weekend they did it
[35:28.480 --> 35:31.840]  again when Ron Paul was announced the winner but because they weren't able to
[35:31.840 --> 35:36.040]  pull off the scan with the microphone with the Mitt Romney contingent they
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.440]  just played the video from the year before and they said that that was a
[35:40.440 --> 35:46.660]  mistake but in an article we wrote about this I saw one of the commenters put
[35:46.660 --> 35:52.320]  it very very well oopsie accidentally used Glenn Beck rally footage making it
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.640]  appear that Michelle Bachman had a huge rally oopsie accidentally used Sarah
[35:56.640 --> 36:00.360]  Palin campaign footage making it appear her book signing had an immense
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.120]  response oopsie accidentally used doctored photos of New York Times
[36:04.120 --> 36:08.440]  reporter and the editor with yellowed teeth and they've been caught warping
[36:08.440 --> 36:14.560]  people's faces as well more receded hairlines in large noses and ears
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.000]  protruding out remember that oopsie accidentally made it appear that Ron
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.400]  Paul's choice at CPAC was being booed when he was actually cheered
[36:23.400 --> 36:28.440]  mistakes will happen that's what the commenter said making a joke about it
[36:28.440 --> 36:35.520]  and I remember all of those Fox News instances and more now obviously on the
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.240]  surface Fox News seems better I mean MSNBC is just completely un-American
[36:40.240 --> 36:46.640]  totally anti-second amendment pushing Obamacare pushing eugenics pushing the
[36:46.640 --> 36:50.800]  case for killing granny creating total race pimping division
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.040]  balkanization I hate them they have special documentaries they air where
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.840]  they're talking about how I'm the greatest evil on earth they're they're
[36:59.840 --> 37:07.920]  completely George Soros manipulated so they give you false choices what do you
[37:07.920 --> 37:14.640]  like MSNBC or CNN then no they're bad but Fox is a case of keep your friends
[37:14.640 --> 37:19.240]  close your enemies closer Fox for over a decade has told you there's no world
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.360]  government there's no plan for a global cashless society the central banks
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.920]  aren't robbing you the Federal Reserve isn't private Ron Paul's dangerous Ron
[37:27.920 --> 37:31.760]  Paul's people might want to blow things up we need to taser them remember all
[37:31.760 --> 37:34.840]  that three years ago when Ron Paul had a chance to win the primaries and they
[37:34.840 --> 37:38.600]  kept saying he's a loser he's bad I mean there's a compilation video in the
[37:38.600 --> 37:42.480]  article that Watson wrote a few days ago a 10-minute video just showing dozens
[37:42.480 --> 37:49.040]  and dozens of examples of them lying about him and demonizing now fast
[37:49.040 --> 37:54.080]  forward to 2010 in the Republican primary ran Paul it's demonized by Fox
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.560]  News he's lied about they they put out all this stuff that he's a big liberal
[37:59.560 --> 38:03.520]  then when he beats the Republican establishment candidate they kind of
[38:03.520 --> 38:10.280]  halfway act like they like him so MSNBC comes in and runs the hoax that he's
[38:10.280 --> 38:15.000]  not a doctor that he's kidnapping women that he worships aqua Buddha that back
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.240]  fires on him he goes from six seven points ahead and polls the 15 points
[38:19.240 --> 38:27.640]  ahead so they've gotten so discredited MSNBC and at Fox News that Fox News is
[38:27.640 --> 38:31.200]  said okay we can't beat them join them so we get their confidence let's admit
[38:31.200 --> 38:35.240]  some world government let's you admit some global cashless society control
[38:35.240 --> 38:40.640]  grid let's admit that Google is NSA run but then let's attack people that don't
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.320]  like being spied on without warrants as liberals we played that clip yesterday so
[38:45.320 --> 38:56.960]  you can see their battle plan it's 110% clear now I said on Tuesday watch Carl
[38:56.960 --> 39:07.320]  Rove is going to openly declare war on Ron Paul because they can't have real
[39:07.320 --> 39:12.080]  conservatives real libertarians focusing on the real power structure the big
[39:12.080 --> 39:15.400]  private central bank that's hijacked our nation they want us fighting with
[39:15.400 --> 39:18.240]  each other as liberals and conservatives because if we ever wake up to the
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.200]  outside powers that have hijacked this nation through fraud we will come
[39:22.200 --> 39:26.360]  together and remove those corrupt globalist and then we can have a real
[39:26.360 --> 39:32.560]  debate about the future of this country and so in a seven minute piece we're not
[39:32.560 --> 39:35.320]  going to play all of it because I have to stop the tape every 10 seconds to
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.720]  analyze the lies Carl Rove throws down the gauntlet and he talks about well he
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.120]  does a bunch of things this is why he's a master of deception he comes out and
[39:46.120 --> 39:52.480]  says that it is a tiny minority that doesn't believe that Barack Obama was
[39:52.480 --> 39:56.920]  born in this country really Gallup poll has more than 25% of Democrats
[39:56.920 --> 40:02.120]  questioning it and as high as 60 plus percent and some Gallup polls others are
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.760]  in the low 50s but it's over half of Republicans and if you look at
[40:05.760 --> 40:09.920]  independence it's more than half of independence so anyway you slice it the
[40:09.920 --> 40:13.680]  majority of politically active Americans question Barack Obama and he
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.560]  won't release the birth certificate they now admit that it's a receipt of birth
[40:16.560 --> 40:25.560]  certificate never the original but the first line is he says well it's a tiny
[40:25.560 --> 40:31.880]  minority that question the providence of Barack Obama's birthplace this is very
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.080]  frustrating there's so many lies to cover then he does a mixing of issues
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.480]  knowing that a lot of conservatives don't like 9-11 truthers because they
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.320]  just can't handle the horror of it and I can understand that at a certain level
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.320]  it's very painful to admit and also very scary so he says if you're a birther
[40:47.320 --> 40:52.840]  you're a 9-11 truth so another form of divide and conquer and then he goes on
[40:52.840 --> 40:58.520]  and says you're gonna let the Democrats win if you continue with this birther
[40:58.520 --> 41:03.040]  stuff so you know it's a lie when he says it's a tiny minority that believes
[41:03.040 --> 41:09.480]  that Obama might not have been born in this country we know he gave up a
[41:09.480 --> 41:13.480]  citizenship in Indonesia but we know that's not true we know Carl Rove's
[41:13.480 --> 41:17.640]  running the dirty tricks of showing Ron Paul being booed and it's all fake and
[41:17.640 --> 41:23.360]  they've now had to admit that you know this and and and so if you're conscious
[41:23.360 --> 41:27.000]  and you're watching it you understand Carl Rove has been attacking the Tea
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.400]  Party Carl Rove's been trying to take over the Tea Party Carl Rove is trying
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.040]  to position this for the establishment to ensure that the left flank and the
[41:36.040 --> 41:41.080]  right flank of the globalist is covered and they're worried about Ron Paul and
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.760]  they're lying to you and saying he can't win they're lying and saying he's not
[41:44.760 --> 41:48.480]  really a libertarian or a conservative they're lying and creating that illusion
[41:48.480 --> 41:51.960]  last year when he won CPAC they said well this doesn't really count anymore
[41:51.960 --> 41:55.160]  they always said it was the most important thing previous to that now
[41:55.160 --> 41:58.440]  they say oh it doesn't really matter plus he got booed this year they couldn't
[41:58.440 --> 42:03.000]  stage the booing and so they say well we'll just play the old tape and say
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.120]  he just got booed this is what they think about you and Americans have to make a
[42:08.120 --> 42:13.000]  decision liberals are you gonna attack Fox News from a leftist position that's
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.480]  a fraud and sit there and still cheerleader around the corrupt Democratic
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.120]  Party or you're gonna attack the corrupt controlled media system for what it is
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.640]  crooks on the left and right working together to keep the American people in
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.320]  the dark and conservatives you've got a decision to make the fact that Fox has
[42:32.320 --> 42:36.120]  been forced to more and more cover the New World Order shows that the
[42:36.120 --> 42:42.840]  alternative media has done its job and that if we continue to drive this
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.160]  they're gonna fail now the largest issue here is how Carl Rove runs this hoax
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.680]  that Ron Paul can't win and if you vote for him you waste your vote he's the
[42:52.680 --> 42:57.640]  only guy that can pull in the libertarian vote a lot of liberals who who don't
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.880]  like him on economics or abortion but do want to end the wars he can get them
[43:01.880 --> 43:07.160]  to crossover he can get and this it's shown in scientific polls he's the most
[43:07.160 --> 43:12.920]  popular in most polls or number two in other polls against Mitt Romney he's the
[43:12.920 --> 43:18.040]  guy best suited to go up against Barry Saturo aka Barack Obama but then Rove
[43:18.040 --> 43:23.360]  goes forward with the key and he says we're gonna lose as Republicans if we
[43:23.360 --> 43:30.480]  don't stand up and ostracize the Ron Paul wing of the Republican Party so he's
[43:30.480 --> 43:34.320]  telling you go after him and then he lies and says but they don't have any
[43:34.320 --> 43:39.040]  power no they're scared to death they don't want to have to address this they
[43:39.040 --> 43:41.480]  don't like the fact that their dirty tricks are blowing up in their face
[43:41.480 --> 43:47.920]  they're scared they're weak they're frauds their jokes they engage in the
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.880]  banker bailout takeover with the Democrats their scammers the people that
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.160]  run Fox News Rupert Murdoch are top globalist openly pushing the carbon
[43:57.160 --> 44:02.040]  taxes supporting the assault weapons ban look at their record look at their
[44:02.040 --> 44:06.760]  fruits not their rhetoric and again I don't make it my business to sit here
[44:06.760 --> 44:10.200]  and analyze Fox or even really watch what they're doing but when they're
[44:10.200 --> 44:15.360]  engaged in this type of throwing down the gauntlet they've got to be called out
[44:15.360 --> 44:19.200]  on the carpet for it so I'm gonna try to play a few minutes of this and just
[44:19.200 --> 44:25.040]  write notes and not stop it and then go back and analyze each piece of the lies
[44:25.040 --> 44:31.920]  of Carl Rove on the O'Reilly Factor here it is there is though and you saw it at
[44:31.920 --> 44:37.880]  CPAC last week in Washington DC there is an element of the Republican Party
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.320]  that's far right okay and that really loves this kind of discourse they love
[44:42.320 --> 44:45.400]  the campaign campaign for Liberty types who are there for Ron Paul right they
[44:45.400 --> 44:51.320]  love Ron Paul they loved Christina O'Donnell they love that let's be
[44:51.320 --> 44:56.080]  clear about it that there is a healthy dose an unhealthy amount of people in
[44:56.080 --> 45:00.920]  the in the in that movement who are I can't help it stop it I keep running it
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.400]  I can't help it back it back up to the start he had a Freudian slip there is a
[45:05.400 --> 45:10.400]  healthy dose see he sees his healthy I mean an unhealthy dose and then he goes
[45:10.400 --> 45:14.760]  in to say it's a tiny minority and O'Reilly goes it's 50 plus percent and
[45:14.760 --> 45:21.480]  he goes oh no no I don't believe that poll really he keeps winning the polls
[45:21.480 --> 45:29.680]  scientific and its CPAC see they're there to make sure campaign for Liberty
[45:29.680 --> 45:34.240]  doesn't actually take the states back Ron Paul doesn't even get into birth
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.040]  certificate he gets into all the issues Roe was about to mention that's another
[45:38.040 --> 45:44.240]  lie go ahead and play it again though and you saw it at CPAC last week in
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.960]  Washington DC there is an element of the Republican Party that's far right
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.440]  okay and that really loves this kind of discourse they love the campaign campaign
[45:53.440 --> 45:57.440]  for Liberty types who are there for Ron Paul right they love Ron Paul they loved
[45:57.440 --> 46:02.560]  Christina O'Donnell that they they love that let's be clear about it that there
[46:02.560 --> 46:07.800]  is a healthy dose an unhealthy amount of of people in the in the in the in that
[46:07.800 --> 46:12.760]  movement who are 9-11 deniers I keep running in them they protest me Ron Paul
[46:12.760 --> 46:16.680]  big Ron Paul stickers and so forth they're the birthers that you know look
[46:16.680 --> 46:26.160]  we had people stand up and and and and boo dick Cheney back it up about 10
[46:26.160 --> 46:30.760]  seconds thank you again I've just got it stop it I can't let these lies go by
[46:30.760 --> 46:34.920]  it's just everything's a lie notice and this is all semantics it's why he's a
[46:34.920 --> 46:40.360]  master he says they're 9-11 truthers they're Ron Paul supporters they're
[46:40.360 --> 46:47.360]  birthers well the truth is most of your birthers are not 9-11 truthers so he's
[46:47.360 --> 46:53.160]  now saying you're a 9-11 denier if you are concerned about the providence of
[46:53.160 --> 47:03.440]  where Barack Obama's really from and then he says they booed dick Cheney I mean
[47:03.440 --> 47:07.200]  dick Cheney had a 10% approval rating when he left office he's hated by
[47:07.200 --> 47:14.800]  conservatives but you do have these kind of soft wanting republicans that are
[47:14.800 --> 47:18.720]  just kind of mindless little pasty soft people who just believe whatever Fox
[47:18.720 --> 47:24.000]  tells them and that's the message he's giving to them declare war on Ron Paul
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.480]  declare war on the birthers he's telling you what to think continue I'm Paul
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.240]  stickers and so forth they're the birthers that you know look we had
[47:33.240 --> 47:41.120]  people stand up and and and and boo dick Cheney and Donald call them a war
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.400]  criminal and because again you got a you got a very big exact it's not big at
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.520]  all remember and it was there you know sort of means back in up 10 seconds we
[47:50.520 --> 47:53.960]  didn't cut that little clip out there's a break and whoever recorded this and put
[47:53.960 --> 48:00.120]  it on YouTube but listen to him they're not big at all they're not big at all
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.320]  and how dare them call dick Cheney a war criminal it's on record they lied
[48:04.320 --> 48:08.440]  about WMD's they consciously lied about it's in the Downing Street and
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.200]  White House memos they told the British get ready to attack we're gonna fix the
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.060]  intelligence they lied about everything they're constantly lying Governor
[48:17.060 --> 48:20.520]  Ridge is on record now admitting they issued fake terror alerts for political
[48:20.520 --> 48:25.640]  gain Ari Fleischer admitted that in the press briefing I mean these are these
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.240]  are war criminals they ordered torture of children in front of their parents
[48:29.240 --> 48:34.480]  they tried to sell you on evil America these are evil people that went along
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.480]  and engineered the banker bailout takeover and then passed the baton to
[48:38.480 --> 48:46.360]  Barack Obama continue boo dick Cheney and don't call them a war criminal and
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.160]  because again you got a you got a you got a very big exact it's not big at all
[48:50.160 --> 48:55.200]  remember and a lot of very you know sort of mainstream issues regarding say the
[48:55.200 --> 48:59.760]  Federal Reserve and hard money percentage of a fraction of her time so this
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.040]  poll says 51% of look look look I know this I don't this poll is funny but but
[49:05.040 --> 49:08.840]  I do say this Republicans and better be clear about this we had a problem in the
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.080]  1950s with the John Birch Society and it took Bill Buckley standing up as a
[49:13.080 --> 49:17.480]  strong conservative and taking them on and within our party we got to be very
[49:17.480 --> 49:21.600]  careful about allowing these people who are the birthers in the 9-11 deniers to
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.160]  get too high a profile and say too much without what percentage of Republican
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.720]  voters five and I don't know but it but it's but whatever it is it ought to be
[49:30.720 --> 49:34.600]  less because I'd stop there of our party to say I'm gonna continue to analyze
[49:34.600 --> 49:40.000]  this we got to be careful we got to stop them from saying too much because Carl
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.920]  Rove he waves a magic wand and says forget the poll at 51 54 56 62 I mean
[49:46.920 --> 49:52.440]  they're all about 50% poll after poll after poll of Republicans don't believe
[49:52.440 --> 49:57.960]  in the official story of where Barack Obama was born and we know he gave up
[49:57.960 --> 50:01.520]  a citizenship to be an Indonesian and he won't release the original birth
[50:01.520 --> 50:04.440]  certificate and the governor Abercrombie said he was gonna release it two months
[50:04.440 --> 50:08.320]  ago and now says he can't find it I mean they've got a real problem here but then
[50:08.320 --> 50:12.760]  he goes further and says we got we got to do what we did in the 50s and have
[50:12.760 --> 50:21.560]  people like Bill Buckley come out and attack people like the John Birch

[54:03.360 --> 54:12.000]  see America is starting to wake up I mean I look at the poll numbers and just
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.560]  the liberals I know in Austin for four or five years they've all been buying
[54:15.560 --> 54:20.360]  guns they finally saw the tyranny of government they're finally shattering
[54:20.360 --> 54:23.400]  their paradigm they're understanding that government doesn't want to take
[54:23.400 --> 54:26.480]  care of them they're understanding when they pay high taxes it doesn't create
[54:26.480 --> 54:31.600]  some happy lovey-dovey welfare state that it's not a safety net that it's a
[54:31.600 --> 54:36.440]  fishing net to capture and domesticate us and I want to ask real conservative
[54:36.440 --> 54:41.480]  something would you sign on to abortion because the Republican Party hasn't been
[54:41.480 --> 54:47.200]  serious and hasn't gotten rid of it Ron Paul will he backs the states banning it
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.800]  do you want to sign your name your soul on to lying about WMDs and killing a
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.680]  million Iraqis what about the Army's own reports of the government and the
[54:56.680 --> 55:02.640]  White House memos ordering torture of even children I mean that's how you've
[55:02.640 --> 55:07.400]  given yourself over to the dark side and I'm not on some high and mighty horse
[55:07.400 --> 55:10.760]  here you know like I'm God up on a mountain telling you what's good and
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.040]  what's evil but I know tortures wrong I know when our troops get tortured it's
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.240]  wrong and when somebody else tortures it's wrong and when we torture it's
[55:18.240 --> 55:23.120]  wrong I know America's been captured by these offshore banks and Ron Paul for
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.320]  close to four decades has been fighting it and exposing it and he's a
[55:27.320 --> 55:32.680]  wonderful man who has a perfect voting conservative record a constitutional
[55:32.680 --> 55:39.160]  record and so you have a choice do you pick Carl Rove or do you pick Ron Paul
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.640]  do you pick bellow Riley or do you pick Ron Paul do you pick Alex Jones or do
[55:44.640 --> 55:49.320]  you pick Sean Hannity a guy I have on video and police state three total
[55:49.320 --> 55:52.640]  enslavement saying every child in America needs an implantable micro chip
[55:52.640 --> 55:58.240]  I mean I've paid attention to what these people say and Obama is politically
[55:58.240 --> 56:01.560]  damaged there are a lot of good conservatives and libertarians getting
[56:01.560 --> 56:04.560]  into the state level their states reversing health care everywhere there's
[56:04.560 --> 56:09.080]  some good tea party candidates in there that tried to defeat the Patriot Act Ron
[56:09.080 --> 56:15.400]  Paul's trying to stop it in the Senate but Carl Rove and the globalists are
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.040]  getting concerned I mean just remember a year and a half ago before climate
[56:19.040 --> 56:23.960]  gate came out that we played clips from Fox TV where Fox was putting out
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.920]  videos bragging how they were promoting carbon taxes Fox entertainment and
[56:28.920 --> 56:33.640]  Rupert Murdoch says he believes in it and once this globalist tax that's the
[56:33.640 --> 56:39.000]  tax for the world government it's out in the open we were right Ron Paul was
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.840]  right I was right and we don't deserve any credit for that it was admitted the
[56:44.840 --> 56:50.800]  globalist program of control is admitted and we're now deep into it and so you
[56:50.800 --> 56:56.800]  have these discredited frauds like Carl Rove and the big Republican talk show
[56:56.800 --> 57:01.280]  host out there who for decades had the cook detector test and made fun of
[57:01.280 --> 57:06.400]  people that talked about a global government and the CFR because on the
[57:06.400 --> 57:09.520]  weekend they're playing golf with them they're flying around on $40 million
[57:09.520 --> 57:16.640]  jets with them they're part of the globalist establishment and Fox news is
[57:16.640 --> 57:22.360]  there to control the Liberty movement so that they can manipulate it but the
[57:22.360 --> 57:26.560]  fact that we forced them to start covering real issues shows we're winning
[57:26.560 --> 57:34.000]  this in the 1950s when Bill Buckley the admitted admittedly was in the CIA was
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.480]  brought in to destroy the John Burt society at the time and stop a true
[57:38.480 --> 57:42.840]  conservative movement from saving this country and all these decades later
[57:42.840 --> 57:45.760]  John Burt society said the country was going to be handed over to China that
[57:45.760 --> 57:48.960]  they were going to be built up because they had Pentagon insiders that told
[57:48.960 --> 57:52.600]  them they said our own government was funding the Federal Reserve to fund the
[57:52.600 --> 57:59.080]  Russians that's now all admitted they've now released all the NKVD files and the
[57:59.080 --> 58:06.240]  headline the New York Times was McCarthy was right but McCarthy was used to set up
[58:06.240 --> 58:13.920]  a police state when he was going after janitors and and file clerks but when he
[58:13.920 --> 58:20.000]  found out the Pentagon was funding the communist they destroyed him in a week
[58:20.000 --> 58:26.320]  politically because it's the big bankers that sit offshore they create a
[58:26.320 --> 58:30.480]  communist collectivist system to steal your wealth so government then can
[58:30.480 --> 58:34.800]  control everything and transfer the money to them offshore it's a very simple
[58:34.800 --> 58:38.200]  equation and that's how these people have all made their money and they want
[58:38.200 --> 58:41.120]  to keep the game going
[58:41.120 --> 58:51.520]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com today this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.520 --> 58:55.280]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.280 --> 58:59.040]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.040 --> 59:03.560]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric

[59:07.800 --> 59:12.400]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the

[59:52.880 --> 01:00:00.400]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:26.040]  Alex Jones we already knew this because it was obvious but China is the
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.920]  reported biggest owner of US debt new WikiLeaks documents show they're
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.160]  basically running much of US policy they've teamed up with the big banks to
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.240]  basically take this country over that's coming up we got Bob Chapman joining us
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.920]  yes he trying to do on new bombshell info on the inside job that was okay
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:49.920]  see and we've got the Tunisian dictator in a in absentia or outside his
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.160]  country and exiles the word has had a convenient stroke that's all coming up
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.040]  but I want to take a bunch of your phone calls and interspersed news with all of
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.200]  that in this hour than to gas joining us in the next hour it is Friday the 18th
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.880]  day of February 2011 let's go ahead and talk to Nick in California Nick thanks
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:15.760]  for holding Alex I had a comment and a question on the the websites they were
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:21.280]  shutting down for allegedly child porn maybe they should go shut down the
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.400]  Pentagon gov website and didn't a bunch of Pentagon employees get caught with
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.720]  child porn and yeah tens of thousands but we got to be careful about that
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.920]  because the way that story came out I looked at it they probably work were
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.440]  claiming that tens of thousands had done it when they hadn't by putting it on
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.640]  their networks as a way to incriminate them because they know about the 4 plus
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.560]  trillion stolen out of Pentagon pension funds in the last eight years and nine
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.480]  years and the fact that there's investigations going on but what about
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.800]  Dyncor what about Halliburton admittedly caught kidnapping children and women I
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:00.960]  mean that's Chicago Tribune BBC in the last 12 years and no one ever getting
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.320]  in trouble with that but yeah no they admit these 84,000 websites had no
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.480]  child porn the government just took them over last week and put messages up on
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.800]  the sites that they were child pornographers mm-hmm and and the and
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  didn't Pentagon employees a few months ago get caught with a bunch of child
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.960]  actual child porn they yes they get caught constantly with it on them in
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.480]  Afghanistan and Iraq and everywhere else but there with the one case you
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.800]  mentioned was where tens of thousands reportedly had it on their networks but
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.720]  but I'm saying that's how it could be true but the problem is the globalist
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.240]  operate this way trying to incriminate people so you don't know what's true
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.760]  because they don't prosecute the admitted cases of it and so then they try
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.760]  to like basically freak out a bunch of people who are innocent yes and then my
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.160]  other question was I've never heard you talk about gang stalking which I've
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.480]  been a victim of for about a year now I've only seen like one article on
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.280]  your website I just wanted to see what you had to say about that Nick I
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.640]  appreciate your call there are moves by the government for secret mind control
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.160]  operations that's been declassified back in the 70s MK ultra MK Naomi there are
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.240]  mind control experiments going on at mental health institutions everywhere
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:19.380]  there are cases of government harassment against people but also there's a lot of
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:25.560]  paranoia and schizophrenia I myself have attracted that obviously with some
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.680]  people and you know they'll show up or see me on the street and say you put a
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.200]  chip in my brain I've seen people go to the county commissioners and say my dad
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.680]  put a chip in them you know I mean just crazy stuff and so a lot of this then
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.240]  I've seen videos on YouTube of people video taping out their window and
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.440]  clearly the body language and stuff it's repair man across the street fixing a
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.400]  you know a sewer line and they're digging in the dirt and people are like
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.640]  look they're putting transmitters in the ground I mean I think 90 plus percent of
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:59.240]  it is a bunch of crazy paranoia are there weird cults who've been caught
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.240]  sneaking into people's houses rearranging things harassing people yes it
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.280]  goes on in fact the cult that Charles Manson was running it came out the
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.920]  court cases they called it creepy crawling and basically it's a form of
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.080]  prowling or peeping tommy they would go into Hollywood stars houses when they
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.000]  were gone at work and rearrange things in their house or they would sneak in
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.320]  almost like counting coup and slither around by their bed at night and do
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.640]  things answer to that is have a big dog to attack people have a chihuahua to
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.720]  alert you and have a 357 Magnum and an instant access pistol safe I set find

[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.520]  let's be clear about that the answer to 1984 1776 the answer to oppression is a

[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.480]  funding for border security and adding tens of billions to the TSA to roll out
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:32.680]  in every city and state in the nation we've also got news on the economy coming
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.400]  up at the bottom of the hour I want to hurry through your phone calls right now
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.240]  because those are always interesting and informative but Fox News as we've been
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.040]  covering and pushed it out nationwide now it's a big national story we started
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.280]  exposing it what going back three days ago and as of yesterday Fox News had to
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:58.040]  respond and admit that they had taken CPAC footage of Ron Paul winning last
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.080]  year 2010 with another hoax they ran were they only let Mitt Romney people into
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.080]  one side to fill up the auditorium they put a microphone in the crowd and had
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.080]  them boo Ron Paul they were unable to pull that off this year so they just
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.480]  aired the old video from last year fully knowing what they did they aired it all
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:20.880]  over Fox over and over again got Ron Paul on and said you know are you embarrassed
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.400]  by this they don't like you why'd you win and now we've had Carl Rove on O'Reilly
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.640]  a few nights ago declare war on Ron Paul and say that we've got to have
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.600]  conservatives come out against him we've got to stop him because they know that
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.880]  real Americans who understand the serious issues we're facing and know who
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.840]  the players are and understand the true geopolitical system we're facing are
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.560]  winning the hearts of minds of people in the Tea Party that was created
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.080]  originally three and a half years ago out of the Ron Paul for president
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:58.040]  movement and they know Ron Paul has got probably 20 times the juice he had just
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.280]  three and a half years ago they're worried because if he runs even if he
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.760]  loses he wins by injecting real issues but in case you missed it here they are
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:13.920]  yesterday with the Fox News hosts saying it was a mistake a mistake that they
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.040]  aired old footage itself a hoax from last year over and over again on Fox News
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.120]  here it is during a during a live introduction to Congressman Ron Paul on
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.640]  Tuesday America's newsroom incorrectly aired a clip from the 2010 CPAC event in
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.680]  Washington rather than this year's event it was clearly a mistake we used the
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.600]  wrong videotape there are similarities in the shot between last year's event in
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.960]  this year 2011 screen left 2010 screen right Ron Paul won both years however
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.520]  there were audible booze in 2010 while you heard a lot more cheering this year
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.720]  it's an honest mistake we apologize for the error we look forward to having
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.400]  representative Paul back on our program okay and I hope Ron Paul brings it up
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.320]  whenever he is back on the program but a commenter on one of the stories dealing
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.840]  with this where they're saying it's a mistake said oops accidentally used
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.360]  glenbeck rally footage making it appear that Michelle Bachman had a huge rally
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.640]  oops accidentally used Sarah Palin campaign footage making it appear her
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:21.440]  book signing had an immense response oopsie accidentally used doctored photos
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:27.280]  of an NYT reporter and the editor with yellow teeth with more receding
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.640]  hairlines in large noses and ears protruding out oopsie accidentally made
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.200]  it appear that Ron Paul's choice of CPAC was being booed when he was actually
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.000]  cheered mistakes will happen and Fox got exposed six seven years ago for this
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.400]  that anybody they don't like they take the photo they yellow it they grow the
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.760]  nose to where it was so ridiculous and so clownish that people called them on
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:59.480]  it and caught them and of course MSNBC does this CNN does this I remember they
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.960]  did a 9-11 hit piece almost a two-hour special on history channel about yours
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.760]  truly a few years ago and they would show me speaking to a crowd of about 500 in
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.800]  Austin and then there was an hour lunch recess at the 9-11 event at UT and they
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.400]  cut for me speaking in the speech to the auditorium during lunch with like five
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.600]  people in it they also did unflattering shots of me with my belly hanging out you
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.760]  know from from down below they would take my face and blow expand the video so it
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.800]  wasn't high-def and deform my face and make it look like you know I had yellow
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.040]  skin I was about to die of liver failure this is what they did and then they
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.040]  would cut to crystal clear perfect suits with glistening light in high-rise
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.720]  stainless steel office buildings with popular mechanics there and it would say
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.360]  conspiracy theorist Alex Jones it would cut experts and they would cut to the
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.680]  quote experts in glistening perfect video shot with perfect audio this is
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:04.240]  what they do and it's tricks they use and you should be made aware of it and
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.320]  understand it's an insult against your intelligence when people do things like
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.600]  this John and Michigan thanks for holding her on the air how you doing Alex
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.480]  good yeah I had a question but since you're talking about Fox News and TV
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.000]  fakery and it's worth looking back over the footage in 9-11 just to see the
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.040]  street interviews that Rick Levin thought did he would go out and he was
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.840]  interviewing people off the street and they'd be talking about bombs and then
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.880]  all of a sudden well I'll just it's too crazy just I'll let you watch it but the
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.200]  question I had was since Bruce Ivan's made it back into the news this week I
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.920]  was hoping you could do a quick breakdown of Dr. Philip Zach and the
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.840]  anthrax attacks I heard you break it all down before and what was sort of like an
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.000]  ambush interview on the John Gibson show but if you can just bring us up to date
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.880]  and quickly summarize all the well everything we said because we interviewed
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.640]  the experts has now been admitted the anthrax was the most super weaponized
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.640]  anthrax and I appreciate your call try to answer what was the first question
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.200]  though so I get to that too I just made a comment about like Fox News and TV
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.240]  fakery that's it's worth just going back and watching the live street interviews
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.960]  with Rick Levin doll 911 sure sure let me let me cover that first I don't get
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.200]  into the anthrax and we've posted and written articles about this at info
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.240]  wars.com and prisonpunna.com over the years you would have real reports with
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.800]  bloodied firemen and police saying there were bombs they said get out they blew
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:36.200]  up seven literally hundreds of them and local newscast saying they're gonna blow
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.040]  up building seven the government's gonna blow it up and police get back they're
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.760]  blowing it up we're supposed to ignore all that then it falls perfectly in its
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.000]  own footprint they announced an hour before and then 25 minutes before on
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.320]  CNN and BBC that building seven had fallen in its own footprint and then
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.040]  hadn't even fallen yet I mean it's incredible that right there total inside
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:02.080]  job but there's all these weird reports on ABC CBS you name it with clean-cut
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.120]  guys were in baseball caps walking up in the first 30 minutes after the tower
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.640]  one and two fell giving the same script word for word well yes the towers fell
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.600]  due to fires and the jet fuel and of course then it fell into its own footprint
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.600]  and it was a total collapse and they and they were clearly scripted people you
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.400]  can look at them they're all you know have proper posture they look like you
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:31.000]  know black-op military types and they're there injecting the official story in
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.760]  amongst everybody else running around telling the truth and firemen going there
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.080]  was melted metal in there it had to be bombs incredible never seen nothing like
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.600]  it it was as if they were detonators boom boom boom popping out see those are
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.800]  real people firemen going we got to get out of here there's got to be more bombs
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.600]  any of these buildings could blow up anytime and then building seven blows
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:57.920]  up those are real people blood coming out their noses cuts all over them but
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.800]  then you got clean-cut guys going oh let me give you an official story and then
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.240]  smiling after they say it perfectly pleased with themselves scripting it
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.080]  properly and then FEMA comes out on ABC news the deputy had a FEMA mr. Kennedy
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.120]  and says yeah we were there the night before for a terror drill and then the
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.760]  media says is that true well no I was mistaken now Giuliani messed up and
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.160]  said yeah I was there for a terror drill and he says oh no I was mistaken tells
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.640]  Congress there was no drill and then it gets declassified tripod tube of the
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.400]  World Trade Centers and building seven being attacked so they'd move the command
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:35.760]  center out the night before out to the end of the pier so it'd be safe I mean
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.760]  they ran this whole thing they ran the whole thing right out in front of
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.400]  everybody and I'm supposed to just go oh well that's politically incorrect to
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.680]  talk about it I did just you just just forget all those videos just forget all
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.320]  that forget the NORAD standout forget bin Laden being CIA forget Amaral
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.280]  Lockie being Pentagon just forget them getting the underwear bomber on the plane
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:03.600]  forget them protecting Major Hassan you just forget it all but to answer your
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:09.560]  other question to even maybe I should shoot a special video in the next few
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:17.040]  days because I don't even want to get into the anthrax case without pulling up
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.200]  all the names all the specific facts again it's so big that that it's too
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.800]  powerful and to a hundred percent proven that it was an inside job to even
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:32.280]  cover it without getting all my ducks in a row but to answer your question you
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.200]  can go research this all for yourself they tried to frame three different
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.400]  people for it then the last guy Ivan's they grabbed him they took him to a
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.960]  government facility and they killed him and it was buried in two newspapers that
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.160]  by the way the government had grabbed him when he was throwing fits and
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.200]  threatening to go public and that he died of a Tylenol overdose in government
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.680]  hands and and when the news said that he'd done it and all this he never got a
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.960]  trial because they killed him it the reason you have even more evidence of
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.400]  them killing him is that it was not on the news the nightly news it was just
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:10.720]  buried as if it was a footnote that all the government had grabbed him and put
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.920]  him in a mental institution at a government facility because he was
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:18.640]  saying he didn't do it and then he conveniently died so they tried to frame
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.640]  three other patsies they grabbed the fourth guy they lied and said that the
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.880]  anthrax had been made in a bathtub with a bucket they said it wasn't weaponized
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.360]  then all these university heads came out and said that's Fort Detrick Maryland
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.280]  the most weaponized aim strain it takes hundreds of millions of dollars of
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.400]  equipment to make it no other government on earth can make anthrax this deadly
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:44.880]  first they miniaturize it I mean the list goes on and on and then it did come
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.680]  out in the news who was known to have broken into the facility who had the
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:54.000]  access to it and we even have that guy's name so I probably should recap go back
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.680]  over all my own research triple check it all and then do like a five minute
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:05.040]  video breaking it down and if I have time I'll do it next week a national
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.560]  magazine has asked me to do a video and a write-up on top of their feature story
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.680]  coming out in a couple weeks and so I'm kind of busy doing that right now and
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:18.600]  I'm doing RT today I'm not complaining I just have a lot of stuff to do but I

[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:12.760]  the anthrax case and I didn't even get to the key point why it's being brought
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.320]  back up now obviously in the last three days a Washington Post headline
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:22.280]  anthrax report cast doubt on scientific evidence and FBI case against Bruce
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:27.920]  Ivan's study questions FBI conclusions on anthrax attacks Washington
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.200]  examiner and here's our detailed report report vindicates questions in anthrax
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:38.760]  conspiracy and this goes through all of the videos and articles we wrote in the
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:45.480]  last nine years breaking down that it was an inside job so if you want to find
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.480]  it all here's the article with the video the audio the documents and as you can
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:59.880]  see more than ten bibliographed links in the back of the article where
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.920]  everything we say is documented and now it's all mainstream news confirming
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.320]  in-triplicate everything we said we actually do research we actually know
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.680]  what we're talking about okay this is real we don't just shoot our mouths off
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.520]  here okay so it I haven't even covered this this week because for me it's old
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.440]  news which is a blind spot I've got all this stuff's constantly breaking
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.040]  vindicating everything we talk about and I never even really took my horn and
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:31.120]  say listen to us but they they tried to frame four different people so they
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.960]  want to have murdered Ivan's just like dr. David Kelly we told you eight years
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.880]  ago they murdered him now what is it almost 90% of Brett's believe he was
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.600]  murdered they've had all these top doctors come out and talk about I was
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.880]  murdered again they claim he bled to death but there was no blood with his
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:53.160]  slit wrist at the site you don't bleed to death with no blood they think we're
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:59.480]  children he had two undissolved caplets in his stomach of a pain pill that
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:06.480]  wouldn't have killed him local police that found him said five men in black
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:12.920]  uniforms ran away from the body dr. David Kelly wrote his colleagues saying
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.640]  now that I've gone public about the lies of WMD's I will be found dead in the
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.400]  woods I've been told and they murdered him put him in the woods I mean that's
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.120]  like Princess Diana made a video and a diary that the government sees what is
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.680]  admittedly real saying Prince Charles told me that if I marry this Egyptian
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:38.720]  that I will be killed in a fake car wreck and then I go on British radio and
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:45.440]  TV and they make fun of me and go Alex claims they kill Diana this is how dumb
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:51.240]  they think we are so I'll do a video on it because the anthrax situation is
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.000]  important but I'll have to do it next week report vindicates questions and
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.200]  anthrax conspiracy Steve Watson totally detailed if you want to go pull this up
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.160]  just put it in a search engine report vindicates questions in anthrax
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.160]  conspiracy and put prison planet dot com behind it and it'll pull up the
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:11.840]  article for you and you can get into the National Research Council basically
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:18.120]  saying the entire official story is a fraud and the council has found it's
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.840]  impossible that he could have done this on his own
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.360]  obviously I mean the facilities that that make this there's only one in North
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:32.120]  America and that's Fort Dietrich one place to make this they tried to claim
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:39.080]  Saddam Hussein did it oh man I tell you you know I I'm gonna get into some

[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:07.080]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:11.120]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.520]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:19.040]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:06.800]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.320]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.720]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.440]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.520]  their long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your shrinking
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:26.320]  dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food savings account from e

[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.920]  federal government is seizing tens of thousands of websites a week and they
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:29.080]  seized 84,000 last week with no evidence no nothing they now admit there was no
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:36.000]  child porn on the 84,000 dog grooming websites real estate company websites
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.480]  you name it restaurant websites your customers go there order a pizza or to
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:45.680]  call to get some landscaping done and it says you're a child pornographer
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:51.280]  they're beta testing the takeover of the web and the kill switches and admitting
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.280]  that that's their plan we have got to use the internet while we still have it
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:01.560]  we've got to do two things defend the web and keep it free and open but at the
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.600]  same time recognize their incrementally clamp clamping down on it three weeks
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.960]  ago Google came out and said we're gonna start blocking and shutting down
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.240]  alternative media websites where they're non-searchable like the drudge
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.320]  report info wars.com they said if you're a content farm meaning links and
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.240]  blurbs and comments on things we're actually have a lot of original stuff
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.720]  obviously but the point is that they're gonna start blocking well they announced
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:27.960]  it after they're already doing it they're already blocking us government
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.280]  paid for broadband in Europe and universities and military bases in
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.240]  many areas in the US for years have been blocking info wars.com and
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:42.880]  presentblana.com why do you think that is why do you think Carl Rove saying we've
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:48.280]  got to run Ron Paul out of the Republican Party these birthers these
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.440]  anti-fella reserve people are dangerous because they work for them just like the
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.880]  Democrats the Republicans and the Democrats engineered the end of
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:00.480]  Glass-Steagall and 99 they engineered the bank or takeover in October 2008 and
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.480]  all the subsequent things we've seen where even Diane Feinstein admitted they
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.000]  were getting a thousand to one phone calls against the bank or bailout and
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.640]  what did then Secretary of Treasury Paulson do he went into a closed
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.880]  session into closed meetings and in House and Senate and said there will be
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.040]  martial law if you don't do what you're told now what does the governor in
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:24.840]  Wisconsin said regardless of where you stand on this union busting what has he
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:31.440]  said what has he come out and said he has come out in front of everyone and in
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:37.200]  their face said I'll use the National Guard on you if you don't like it this
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.320]  whole police state grid is for the American people as they begin to take
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.960]  the pension funds as they begin to increase the taxes as they begin to cut
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.440]  spending look I don't like the big ballooned bloated government I don't
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.160]  like the out of control unions in some cases the unions were sold out to the
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.160]  globalist and NAFTA and GATT by 1994 but it is somewhat of a counterbalance
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:02.000]  to the big mega corporation so it's being broken up and that's what Obama
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:09.040]  was was a union buster liberal in Chicago so he plays the part of the
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.040]  savior while the Republicans play the part of the bad guys for unions as they
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.920]  try to bust them up but if we're gonna have 28 trillion and counting given to
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:24.440]  offshore secretive banks a few hundred billion the other unions the and now
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.920]  they're announcing we're gonna cut your pay and make you pay more into your
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.400]  pension fund which you'll never get they've already taken the military's
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.000]  pension funds I get emails all the time well Alex how are you saying that 2.1
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  trillion was stolen by 2001 well because of the associated press reported and it
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.320]  was admitted 2.1 trillion missing from the Pentagon just search it you'll get
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:53.760]  AP it was admitted the last time we saw congressional hearing on it in 2006 the
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.320]  last time it was brought up it was over 4 trillion missing people say well the
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:02.440]  defense budgets only a trillion bucks on budget close to another trillion off
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:07.280]  budget you count intelligence how are they stealing a trillion or more a year
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.160]  because there were all those giant funds for the VA and for the pension funds
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.680]  and the death benefits and what did Bloomberg report last year and I keep
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:21.800]  going back to this because it's so big VA headline signed secret deal with major
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:25.880]  insurance companies to withhold death benefits they take that money out of
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:30.720]  your little military check for the 10 years the 20 years the 25 years met the
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.880]  three years whatever the case says you're in the military and then you die
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.040]  in combat or you die of a heart attack when you're 65 whatever it is and your
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.120]  widow or widower goes to get the money and they're told sorry you don't get
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.520]  jack diddly squat they stole the pension funds already they stole the social
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:51.400]  security already they stole most the private pension funds already and they're
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.000]  saying oh they're in trouble they're underfunded 48 states are about to go
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:02.120]  bankrupt or are already technically insolvent the answer is pay us more
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:06.160]  taxes we'll take over your pension funds Congress says they'll take over the
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.240]  states and receivership the federal government itself and receivership to
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:13.040]  the private Federal Reserve the second biggest owner of the fraudulent debt
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:20.240]  after the communist Chinese we've been positioned into this situation and I'm
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:26.800]  just a normal guy who studied it stating public facts who are the terrorists
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.800]  are they the men in caves that are protected and left alone or are they
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.880]  the big banks who've already stolen the military's death benefits all these
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.200]  people that wrap themselves in the flag and oh support the troops that means
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.400]  feed them into a meat grinder support them by not caring about them I actually
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.920]  care remember Obama a year and a half ago we had the head of the veterans of
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:51.440]  foreign wars on VFW it was in the news Obama got him in a meeting and said we
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:59.840]  want to go ahead and not pay for people at the VA anymore we want to now make
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:06.160]  them go out and buy their own insurance remember that folks the military signed a
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.280]  contract the military they take taxpayer money and put it in the VA funds
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:13.520]  there's plenty of money but they give them horrible care because they're
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.400]  stealing it out the back door now others would say be patriotic sit down and
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.360]  shut up no I will not sit down I will not shut up so what they're the way
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.640]  they're phrasing this now by making it a left-right issue is that as the teachers
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:32.920]  have their funds slashed and sure there's corruption there but as as their
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.160]  pension funds get taken part or all they'll say oh that's that's what
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:40.000]  bankrupted the government that was the problem you could get rid of all the
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.200]  pension funds public and private you get rid of all the government spending the
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.480]  debt is so huge most of it fraudulent they've now tied us to the bankers debt
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.840]  their 1.5 quadrillion and derivatives that they're saying give us all the
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.800]  money give us unlimited new taxes or we will implode the economy as they're
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.480]  already incrementally imploding economy as they held the nation hostage back in
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.520]  October of 2008 saying we will fully destroy the stock market if you don't
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.000]  do it and Congress didn't pass the bill so they have the head of the Federal
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.600]  Reserve the head of the Treasury all the private bankers go out on TV and say
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:18.440]  we're going into a depression that killed confidence and there was a thousand
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.160]  point stock market plunge and then the Congress under financial terrorism with
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.080]  a financial gun to their head ran back and said we'll do whatever you say
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:33.120]  okay you're the boss I mean I wanted to recap that so just like they first in
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.280]  Europe started banning free speech 30 years ago or so by saying white
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.960]  supremacists shouldn't have free speech and the average politically correct
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.800]  person said yeah that sounds reasonable now if you criticize the EU they try to
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.600]  arrest you now if you criticize Muslims calling for a Muslim Europe you get
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.800]  arrested or hold into court see once you get rid of free speech for one group
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:04.200]  everybody loses it and it's the same exact paradigm the same exact system now
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.720]  with this look at these lazy teachers look at these bad people you know they're
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:13.000]  getting their pay cut they deserve it we've got to fix America why look at the
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:20.440]  New Jersey governor look at the Wisconsin governor they're getting tough and it
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.560]  sets that precedent to now frame it that it's the unions that did all of this
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:30.000]  no the unions were the domestication of the population the unions were getting
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.480]  people addicted to government control it's a small part of the equation and so
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.000]  it's now this smoke screen to wire economies imploding to why the taxes
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.360]  are going up and so they play it off against people to then cut all the
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.520]  benefits which are bad enough because we're domesticated and made dependent
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.600]  by them but then if you cut those that's the little bit of government money as
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:42:00.080]  they devalue the dollar at least flowing in to the mom and pop shops at least
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:08.040]  flowing into the society and the culture I'm against it but only after we get
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.960]  rid of the private Federal Reserve that's where the real problem is you
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.800]  don't fix that you don't write off the 1.5 quadrillion fraudulent debt that
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.760]  they've had us fraudulently signed on to it's over is Ted there John okay I'm
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.160]  going to Ted Anderson and then we're going to your phone calls ahead of our
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.880]  guest you'll just be on this for five minutes because I wanted to get into this
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:32.720]  with Ted who's the owner of the Genesis Network and minus resources China
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.080]  flexes muscles with us as biggest creditor WikiLeaks reports CNBC
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.880]  confidential diplomatic cables from US embassies in Beijing and Hong Kong
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.360]  labor China's growing influence on America's largest creditor as the US
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.480]  Federal Reserve grappled with the aftershocks of financial crisis the
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.120]  Chinese like many others suffered huge losses from their investments in
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.160]  American financial firms from Lehman Brothers the primary reserve fund the
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.480]  money market fund that broke the buck the cables obtained by WikiLeaks show the
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:05.200]  escalating Chinese pressure prompting a procession of soothing visits by the US
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.080]  Treasury Department yeah where the Chinese laugh at Hillary and others and
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:12.880]  laugh at Geithner in one striking instance a top Chinese money manager
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.480]  directly asked US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner a favor in June of
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:21.120]  09 the head of China's powerful sovereign wealth fund met with Geithner and
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.120]  requested that he lean on regulators at the US Federal Reserve to step up the
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.360]  approval of a 1.2 billion investment in Morgan Stanley according to cables and
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.280]  it just goes on for page after page how they're now running the SEC regulators
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:41.080]  and the Federal Reserve you we hear owns 900 billion the Chinese 1.1 trillion
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:45.440]  how is that factor in to 1.5 quadrillion a thousand five hundred
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:52.480]  trillion versus a few trillion see China is not really the biggest owner of our
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.480]  debt it's that China owns the real Treasury bills that you could say is
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:01.920]  real debt owed by the federal government via the American people but see we're
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.520]  already signed on to the 1.5 quadrillion and growing no one ever talks
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:12.040]  about that giant 1,500 times size elephant there's an elephant 1,500
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:18.240]  times conservatively bigger than the little two trillion dollar elephant so
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:21.200]  they tell us oh we got to pay our debts oh we got to cut all the state pensions
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.000]  oh we got to take the veterans pensions oh we got to do all this after they get
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.280]  us addicted to it like a third-world country but really we're paying into
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.680]  this on the 1.5 quadrillion owed by the bankers now I know I keep hammering that
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.600]  over and over again because it's so important and it continues another
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.960]  report here is China hoarding gold in anticipation of a global financial
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:47.320]  implosion 10 facts about gold fever in China that may surprise you and I wanted
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.960]  to go over some of this according to the World Gold Council China hasn't
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:59.560]  consumed 579.5 tons of gold during 2010 the United States consumed only 233.3
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.320]  tons China has been importing gold at a feverish pace in fact China imported
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.920]  five times as much gold in 2010 as it did during 2009 that's five times number
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.520]  three the Chinese appetite for gold only seems to be accelerating in 011 the
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.840]  industrial and commercial bank of China sold approximately 15 times a physical
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:21.880]  gold in 010 that was a huge amount but during the month of January alone the
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.160]  bank sold approximately seven tons of physical gold the growth and demand for
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.680]  gold in 2011 is being called explosive by executives at the bank while the
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.760]  globalists try to suppress the price of it the public price is a fraud the
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.480]  government price is a fraud what it's trading for is many times 10% higher than
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:45.280]  what they claim it is paper gold versus real gold Chinese demand for gold is
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.320]  now risen approximately 25% of total global production number five investment
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:53.600]  demand for gold in China's sword by a whopping 70% during 2010 it's being
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.280]  projected that China gold investment demand will grow another 40 to 50%
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.400]  during this year number seven consumers in China and India now account for more
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:05.240]  than half of all global demand for gold jewelry and gold coins number eight
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.680]  Chinese households have purchased almost half the much gold since 2007 as
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.440]  well as the investors in the West combined number nine on the Shanghai gold
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.040]  exchange trading volume soared 43% during the first 10 months of 010 number
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.880]  10 China replaced out of Africa is the number one gold producer in the world
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.120]  back in 2007 China's gold mines produced at an all-time record 340 tons of gold
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.200]  last year they're buying mines up from the US you name it South America
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:37.360]  Australia now why is that important shine we're seeing what the New World
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.200]  Reserve currency is they're claiming it's an str new cashless system backed
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:46.520]  up with taxpayer money and carbon taxes that's only one layer the big move by
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.600]  the Arabs the Europeans the Japanese the Chinese and Americans and many others
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.480]  the real move the clear leader now in moving away from dollar as we see
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.200]  dollar death becoming imminent the end of the dollar the world reserve currency
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:06.800]  is gold you've seen a 400% increase the last 11 years it goes down a little but
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:11.880]  always goes back up more they can no longer suppress it Ted Anderson what
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.960]  does this mean that now every analyst worth their salt confirms gold is now
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:20.480]  becoming the world reserve currency this is the big secret well I mean what
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.600]  it means to me being in the physical side of the market that it's getting
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:27.920]  very very hard to get silver or gold I mean that to be able to supply
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.880]  ourselves I mean there's just not enough gold to go around maybe enough to hit
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.320]  maybe if 3% of the people in the United States decided to buy gold it would be
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:42.360]  gone over in in China if they picked up one and a half percent of the people to
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:45.880]  buy gold there just wouldn't be enough supply to go around and the graph show
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.440]  that they're headed that direction this year that's going to happen in China
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.360]  probably in the next few months and we see it starting to move that way in the
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:56.760]  US it sure is and Alex it's driving the prices up I mean silver is going through
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.640]  the roof today I mean silver hit a high that we haven't seen in 30 years it hit
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.400]  $32.92 we're almost at $33 silver right now and this is what I told people when
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:10.920]  they artificially drove it down a few months ago I said watch next time it
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:14.720]  goes up it's gonna break the previous record from last year it already has
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.680]  today it sure has and gold of course hitting almost $1400 an ounce for a
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:25.000]  $13.93 20 I mean the market is just incredibly strong this thing is an
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.480]  ending and now we're looking at a war in the Middle East and everybody's
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.320]  wondering how much money we have to print in order to finance that fight I
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.120]  mean there's no wonder that you know people are concerned about the United
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.760]  States dollar I mean that printing press is running like crazy and gold is
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.560]  going up as well Ted here's the $64 million issue whether somebody wants
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:46.920]  one silver half dollar or you can get three silver half dollars basically at
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:51.000]  cost and get three of my films free and free shipping that's basically a 70
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.920]  dollar value on top for free people can do the math it's amazing you've got a
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.560]  bunch of Frank sovereigns buffalos but if people want the old price from a
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.720]  month ago and you told me this morning you're running out if they want to
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:08.600]  again get the time machine go back when it was lower something nobody else can
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.520]  offer tell folks the specific coins you've got for the radio special and
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.040]  when the price is going to go up well let me just collect that correct that
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.440]  Ferrari and slip that you just had it isn't silver halves that I'm offering
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.440]  with the videos the real silver dollars and that it's at that's $97 for three
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:30.040]  videos and three silver dollars silver's at $33 an ounce anybody can do the math
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:34.320]  you have to be absolutely out of your mind if you don't take advantage of that
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.520]  offer I mean you're gonna get Alex's videos that helps support Alex you get
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.800]  the so that's not support you to the math that's that's what a three silver
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.680]  dollars at 33 come out to that I mean a silver is what 33 times 3 I mean you're
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.520]  gonna be at $100 this is delivered at 91 I mean there's the 97 there's the math

[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:25.600]  visiting my wife's nice family and I'll sit there and you know tell them six
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.840]  seven years ago hey gold's at $400 an ounce it's gonna go up they're starting
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:35.160]  to duty value the dollar it'll take many years to do it but gold's gonna go up
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.280]  and they just like oh yeah right Alex then I see him a year later hey it's
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:45.440]  700 now you might want to buy hey it's 800 now it's a thousand now it's 1200
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.520]  now it's 1300 now it's 1400 now I remember telling people buy silver I
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.440]  remember telling my dad ten years ago when silver was four and a half five
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:55:02.560]  dollars an ounce dad get into silver get out of the stock market and it just
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.320]  people can't imagine physically holding it they can't imagine that security and
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.920]  people say well of the dollars devaluing why do I want it because you buy it when
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.560]  it's low and then when you cash them in even though the dollars devalued now you
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:21.080]  cash them in at whatever that new value is it stops inflation I don't even get
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:25.280]  it as an investment though it obviously has been a great investment so of course
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.160]  I hyperventilate when I talk about this I know Ted is offering deals because even
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.440]  though he bought this gold and silver over a month ago at one of its latest
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.760]  lows I get the internal might as resources printouts fact I ought to show
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:46.080]  one to you I had before where it says our markup on this is 3% I mean you're
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:53.480]  talking on but remember silver and gold has gone way up so Ted bought it when it
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.520]  was low and his markup was 2 3% on these specials so he can order it and pay for
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.920]  his staff very competitive but when golden silver goes up and he's still
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:13.080]  offering at the old price it's below what it should be 3 silver dollars I mean a
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:17.080]  silver dollar anywhere it's like 33 34 35 dollars do the math that's above 100
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.680]  bucks three of them for 97 with the shipping included that cost about 10
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.600]  bucks for Ted to send it registered so it's insured and then three of my films
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:30.120]  that cost $60 I mean I when I tell you you can't get a better deal than this you
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:37.600]  cannot Ted briefly tell folks the number to call it's 800 686 2237 and I'd say
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.200]  buy from us and support the network and what we do but it's not even really
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:46.960]  supporting the network I mean when you do these things at 3% markup that just
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:50.720]  basically covers your cost doesn't it Ted yeah it does but you know I mean the
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:54.120]  thing is if you get the videos and you pass them out it supports it many gets
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.680]  the word out there I mean that's the fuel that lights the fire that's been
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:02.360]  burning in the bellies of people that want Liberty Alex and your videos carry
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:06.480]  that message loud and clear I don't know how you they can find a better
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.400]  resource for that plus also you get three silver dollars I mean my goodness
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.080]  yeah I should add Ted couldn't do this if I didn't sell in the videos almost at
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.720]  cost but I do that again to get them out that's why I say make copies of my
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:23.040]  films it's about getting the word out and it's about protecting yourself
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:28.840]  storeable food firearms gold and silver Ted I seriously I can't find a deal
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:32.760]  better than your offering I hope people call you well I tell you what Alex when
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:38.840]  it took 24 dimes it takes 24 dimes now to buy one old silver dime and back in
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:43.800]  1965 it took only one you know that you're not winning by owning paper
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:49.320]  currency it's losing purchasing power but they have this illusion where it it
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.240]  goes up in the graph but always dips a little before going back up and so people
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.040]  go well it just went down and the media has all these headlines about gold's
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.240]  dead silver's dead and it always follows the same trend because of dollar
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:04.720]  devaluation and paper devaluation we know what we're talking about go folks
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:10.640]  search the term 10 year gold graph 10 year silver graph or 11 year silver
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:17.680]  graph 11 year gold graph it's going straight up 800 686 2237 they play mine
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:24.240]  games with you folks 800 686 237 is gold the perfect hedge against inflation is
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.400]  it the perfect investment no there's nothing perfect on earth but it is the
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:31.920]  best there's no doubt about that historically and that's what I believe
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.960]  and what I go with and has it proven right you bet your bottom dollar it has
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:46.600]  800 686 2237 thanks to Anderson thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN

[01:59:53.080 --> 02:00:00.720]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.000]  Alex Jones we are now into our number three Bob Chapman's with us for the
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.400]  entire hour I like to sometimes have another guest pop in with Bob because
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:36.360]  his knowledge is so wide similar to the wide spectrum analysis that I engage in
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.360]  so whether for 30 minutes alone take a few calls and then Jesse Trinidad the
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:44.760]  lawyer who continues to sue and get internal documents concerning the
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:50.080]  inside job was that was the okc bombing in 95 he's gonna be joining us with Bob
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.360]  coming up in 30 minutes but Bob's so much happening so much developing Ben
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.520]  Ali the former dictator Tunisia had a convenient stroke just like housing
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:06.200]  mubarak now how obvious is that getting we've got also China now WikiLeaks
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.840]  confirming basically ordering the SEC around on their internal deals in the
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:18.400]  US is that not espionage by the SEC with a foreign power with China through the
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.640]  US government controlling mergers and deals I mean I mean that that's a
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:28.720]  foreign power that's what globalism is I guess running our country well at least
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:36.840]  in part and at least that part because of their almost $900 billion in most
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:44.520]  in treasuries and agencies the agents are these bonds are fanny freddy jenny
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:52.560]  and FHA bonds they have been continually reducing their position they
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:58.040]  reduced it last month by four billion dollars and they continue to pack away
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:07.320]  at it the exchanges that they've made with Greece and Spain and Portugal for
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:19.880]  loans have involved the sale of the US paper they are sticking their nose in
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:24.200]  everywhere that they can because they think they have a hammer and they they
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:31.280]  really do the best thing for the US government to do is say look enough you
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.000]  are in your country will run ours and if you don't like it will just evaluate the
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:44.400]  currency and default in our debt how would you like that well I think that
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.680]  I think that's something they should think about I hadn't heard too much about
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:55.520]  that but that's going on all the time behind the scenes they're pushing and
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:01.560]  pushing and pushing and at the same time they continue to buy dollars with
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:08.160]  young you want as it's pronounced that they create out of thin air just like
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.120]  the Fed does and they continue to purchase those dollars so they can buy
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:18.600]  treasuries so they can keep the value of their currency down and really the
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:25.120]  secret is that sooner or later they're going to have to stop doing that they're
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.400]  gonna have to let their currency float to where it should be upward and that
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:34.320]  means less exports to the United States the exports of the United States will be
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:39.880]  more expensive it also means that I have less inflation in China because the
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.520]  dollars that are coming into China are causing inflation and then they have
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:49.040]  their own internal problems as well which are very very serious every bit as
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:53.720]  bad as what the problems that America has and that varies from province to
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.920]  province some of them are doing fine and some of them upside down and we're
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.600]  also seeing riots in Mexico riots in Saudi Arabia Yemen I mean this is
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.200]  popping up everywhere obviously driven by dollar a devaluation that's
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:15.560]  triggering more commodity increases and prices which is putting pressure on poor
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:21.120]  people well we discussed it three weeks ago and you and I both agreed that this
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:25.640]  is what was going to happen and that is what has happened and we were even
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:31.760]  seeing it in Wisconsin and Ohio and we're gonna continue to see it over the
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:35.600]  next several years hold that thought change hold that thought Bob I want to
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.280]  come back to you we may have to reconnect to you your phone lines usually awesome
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:42.560]  it's breaking up a bit so we'll reconnect with Bob Chapman we're gonna
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.440]  come right back with him and continue that's right he did lay all this out
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:50.600]  three weeks ago he laid it out five years ago but he laid it all out three
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:55.360]  weeks ago that you'd have this Egypt effect we're gonna come back and break
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.880]  all this down then we're gonna take some of your phone calls and get into what's
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:04.760]  happening with Golden Silver hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:08.760]  you about the Silver Lungs Generator now you can produce pure and endless
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:12.960]  colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:17.040]  breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:20.840]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:25.160]  Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:30.400]  silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:34.080]  the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.400]  nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:43.760]  the Silver Lungs Generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are

[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:06.120]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:10.720]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:19.160]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:23.960]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:28.320]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:33.600]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:37.880]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:41.400]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:46.640]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:52.640]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:58.160]  info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:03.560]  planet TV this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:08.000]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.160]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:16.200]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:20.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:24.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:28.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:36.560]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:40.720]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:44.120]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:05.800]  this communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.560]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.200]  MSNBC is reporting that Egypt is okay Iranian warships through the Suez Canal
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:23.200]  Israel calls it a provocation canal officials said only war could have
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:27.000]  blocked request and Israel said in the last three days that they are
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.920]  considering a military strike on Iranian gunboats really small inc
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:38.200]  consequential vessels I guess they're not allowed to traverse the
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:43.240]  international canal and go into the Mediterranean though everybody else is
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:49.080]  again who's really starting the provocation here why is Iran doing
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:52.800]  this are they hoping Israel so brazen they attack them it'll be some type of
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:58.360]  political score points for Iran you know there's a reason the commodities are
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:05.380]  going up it's not just that the dollars being devalued it also factors into the
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:10.360]  Middle East tension now Bob going back years ago I predicted it you predicted
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.860]  Gerald Salente countless others dr. Paul Craig Roberts it doesn't take a brain
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:21.800]  surgeon or a quantum mechanics physicist to know that the dollar is the world
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:26.480]  reserve currency worldwide the dollar is devaluing faster outside the country
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:30.520]  than it is inside the country and that's normally how these inflation
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:36.640]  situations work and that if you got half the people in Egypt and more than half
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.160]  at some of these other countries it varies on $2 a day or less that if
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:46.120]  they're heating oil their gasoline their rice their their wheat their corn
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:50.600]  prices go up exponentially with this big food bubble driven by dollar
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:53.760]  devaluation that they're going to get angry people then say well Alex are you
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:58.880]  saying that the globalist triggered these rebellions or are you saying that
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.320]  they're real no there's real dictators and really angry people and the
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.040]  globalist have set up the IMF World Bank policies on top of it ordering food
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.000]  rations cut as they go up and then they know people are about to revolt
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.800]  tracking the Twitter and the Google they go in because Google admits they can
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.280]  predict future trends almost a hundred percent in mass groups with this the
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:22.080]  herd mentality then they come in and trigger it with their people to try to
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.120]  control the direction it goes Bob Chapman is that an accurate boil down
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:32.200]  totally is and you know we hear so much about harp and we don't know exactly
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:36.440]  what it's doing for the United States government and others as well their
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:41.080]  other versions and so you see floods in Australia that happen you know every
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:46.160]  100 years and now we've got a drought and two sections of China but we have
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:52.600]  ample over ample rain in Argentina and so you put these things together and
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:57.680]  then you get this flight to quality that's being caused by people leaving
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:01.360]  currencies but particularly the dollar buying commodities and particularly
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.920]  gold and silver now today is a good example and yesterday of market rigging
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:14.680]  the government through Morgan pushed down the gold stock yesterday and then
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:19.920]  today they raise much in requirements and gold and silver again because people
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:26.600]  who buy commodities and gold and silver they don't put all the money down they'll
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:33.280]  borrow a certain amount of it could be 80% and so when the margin requirement is
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:41.720]  raised they pay more interest and that tends to mute or neutralize the upward
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:47.000]  movement of gold and silver and anything else that they do it to they also did it
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.240]  to platinum and palladium and they do this all the time in order to rig the
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:58.360]  market and at the same time Morgan is asking their cash clients in their cash
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:04.600]  accounts if they've got any of these gold stocks can we borrow them because we
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:09.520]  want to go short and knock them down well anybody who would lend their stocks
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:14.440]  to them would have to be out of their mind because they'd be knocking their
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:19.560]  own stock down but this shows you how crooked and how desperate these people
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:25.480]  are and this sort of thing goes on all the time but Bob here's the bottom line
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:30.280]  their congressional investigations kicking in dealing with big banks
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:34.400]  manipulating silver and gold if you look at the overall 1011 year graph gold
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.920]  silver is only going straight up so is every other major commodity and it's a
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.640]  losing battle they're able to push it down to have a psychological effect but
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:50.120]  it always retraces the old gains and goes to new highs and now we see China and
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.240]  others accelerating their purchasing to record levels I see a major breakout
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:13:01.480]  coming in the near future what do you see it already happened today a clean
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:08.520]  breakout for silver on a technical basis next stop 37 38 maybe higher and that's
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.960]  going to take gold right along with it and what I told you happened about an
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:19.880]  hour and a half ago on the margin requirements the silver and gold came
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:24.760]  off it's going right back up again and you're right it's a very temporary thing
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:30.120]  these are desperate people doing desperate things you've got the Fed doing
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:35.160]  things that they know will be unsuccessful but they don't what else to do
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:42.960]  they're in a box they can't get out amazing Bob your phone again normally is
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.200]  great it's breaking up a little bit but the information is so powerful we'll
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.720]  try to reconnect during the next break but there's a lot of other things
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:55.680]  happening in the world how obvious does it have to get now that Ben Ali the
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:00.320]  former Tunisian dictator thrown out a month ago ran to Saudi Arabia and had a
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:06.720]  magical stroke the same way that Mubarak ran to Israel then back to back
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.280]  to Egypt and had a stroke I mean this is getting really ridiculous well I
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:18.000]  think in Mubarak's case it might be believable and age-wise it's not
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:24.040]  believable for the gentleman who fled Tunisia but if you've read about his
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:30.520]  wife there's validity to it she was the one she was the one that snatched the
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:35.280]  gold yeah but it's starting to get a little obvious here when Mubarak says
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:38.920]  I'm not gonna step down for a few months and the US says yes you will then
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:42.240]  magically he disappears whenever seen again in here he has a stroke and he does
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:48.720]  step down and now this guy runs off and has a stroke I mean come on now it's all
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:55.800]  phony I just thought I'd made it a life like a light of it considering Mubarak's
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:59.600]  age but what's this new thing where they just have a stroke because it's too
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:05.720]  obvious when they just kill them yeah it could be could very well be we're just
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:13.800]  gonna give you one stroke and you don't have to have any more amazing Bob I
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:17.160]  want to go to some phone calls for you they'll be all over the map but I know
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:22.720]  you can certainly answer them but before we go any further you were getting
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:26.960]  into these rebellions spreading worldwide now in multiple states in the
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:31.040]  US and Mexico all over the Middle East you predicted that where do you see it
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:38.800]  going now I think it will slowly go forward in different places places
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:42.680]  they'll take longer than others some places you're gonna have violence right
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:49.000]  away like you just saw in Bahrain and which is the newest one and in Wisconsin
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:55.520]  and Ohio he had no violence violence is born usually of extraordinary
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:02.160]  frustration or it's a commercial issue which is like food costs too much and I
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:08.240]  can't afford it or I'm gonna lose my job permanently what am I gonna do and those
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:14.760]  are the kind of things there their belly items will call them they get right
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:18.920]  down to the nitty-gritty of survival and I think that's what's gonna kick the
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:24.480]  US forward but there are other nations that have more of those kinds of
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:29.160]  problems they have more poor people and they don't have extended unemployment
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:37.520]  and they also do not have food stamps I mean go to Mexico they don't have those
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:44.160]  things and so the chance for insurrection are far greater in other
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.400]  countries why are the globalist in closing and we're going to call so
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:53.040]  arrogant Bob you've got the big mega banks making record profits consolidating
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:56.680]  the entire economy engaging in crime won't say we're tens of trillions of
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.840]  dollars have gone overtaking nations getting nations they've bought off to
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:05.440]  sign on to their bank or debt the case of Ireland's a great new example where
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:08.240]  it's admitted the people don't own it but the government says hey we're
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:13.160]  signing you on to this debt I mean how far can they go as they become fat as
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.480]  pigs in front of everybody and as everybody else starts losing their job
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:21.840]  or getting their pay cut well what I think will happen is the demonstrations
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:26.720]  and and the riots will come to every country and I've said this over and over
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.480]  nobody's going to be immune it'll be better in some places and others and
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:37.040]  the next step after that is revolution I expect half the countries in the world
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:41.160]  are going to have revolution and I'll tell you why because of your program and
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:47.440]  programs that go all over the world and the internet we are reaching
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:53.880]  millions of people out there in fact the foreigners to us are far more
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:59.920]  interested in what we've got to say and our fellow American citizens I can't
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:04.600]  believe it and I that's borne out by the letters that I get many of which I
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:11.160]  run in the forecaster from foreigners as well as the number of people who were
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:16.280]  subscribing from foreign countries is very high yes a lot of the world is
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.920]  more advanced in the tyranny so they know how right we are historically but
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:24.040]  but we're going to break we're to come back and talk to Tim Anthony James
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:28.640]  Dana Tom and a few others ahead of Jesse trying to do joining us bobble
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:32.320]  ride shotgun but I forgot to mention this coming out of the last break my IT
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:36.760]  guys have a hundred percent confirmed that we are under a massive denial of
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:43.320]  service attack at info wars calm right now but luckily we've got a lot of big
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:48.240]  CDNs and giant servers and we're pretty much under routine attack from this and
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:53.400]  other systems so remember folks don't want you seeing info wars calm in
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.640]  prison planet calm they don't want you getting this information how do you
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:02.680]  counter that you spread the word about info wars calm in prison planet calm in
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:06.360]  this radio show you take the video stream the audio streams from the show
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.200]  you link them to your friends and family we reach new people you don't even
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.680]  have to talk yourself blue in the face direct them to this broadcast and all
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:17.920]  the amazing guests and the information we cover here but know this I've had to
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:21.600]  hire more IT people I've got a full time sit on top of this but it only makes us
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:26.160]  stronger as Nietzsche said that which does not kill us only makes us stronger
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:31.280]  and we aren't becoming stronger you know they say that pain is weakness leaving
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:35.400]  the body and that's certainly happening in our operation it was hack attacks
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.840]  years ago because I could only have individual servers that made me start
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:41.920]  more websites so that when they hacked one that was down for a while and have
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.760]  another turns out that's now the industry leader for folks to start more
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:50.280]  websites and roll them out and make them all big they call it a synergy I didn't
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:54.880]  know that their attacks is the reason you have prison planet calm and all our
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:20:00.360]  other sites I mean it's so it as God says no weapon formed against us will
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:04.200]  prosper hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now

[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:13.480]  all right let's take a few phone calls for Bob Chapman I had a bombshell info
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:19.640]  on Oklahoma City I know Bob will have comments on that with us Tim in Michigan
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:25.800]  you're on the air worldwide. Hey Mr. Jones how you doing today this is Cracker
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:32.400]  Tim from the big Detroit City. Okay buddy what's on your mind? Hey well first off
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:38.920]  this isn't exactly the point that I was going to talk about but they kind of
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:43.600]  just jumped out from some of the stuff that you said so I just thought you can
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:49.160]  research on your own you're talking about you know how the veterans were
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:55.200]  being treated and on the front page of the Macomb Daily which is the county
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:01.720]  paper here you can get it at macombdaily.com it says wounded vets still
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:07.640]  waiting for benefits red tape could mean fewer families are eligible and then
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:12.920]  and then we got a new pandemic did you hear about this it's called
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:20.520]  whooping cough or they call it pertussis and now all of a sudden there's this
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:25.680]  huge article on the hot page. Yeah but I mean you'll notice it's not even that
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:30.200]  many cases and a lot of times they point out it's kids that were vaccinated so it
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:33.880]  means it wasn't even protecting them but they've got this big push going to
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.840]  vaccinate people Tim I appreciate your call Bob on the front of the fact that
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:41.600]  they've already stolen the veterans benefits out the back door that's why
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.720]  they're moving now to try to block as many of their benefits as they can. That's
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:53.520]  correct and they also cheated them on their life insurance policies and it's
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:59.440]  it's abominable what they've done I'm a veteran and I do with a veteran show have
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:05.800]  for about five and eight years and they're active as well and it just you
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.920]  have no idea it just drives me crazy when I hear this stuff and I'm very very
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:14.360]  disappointed that our government has done that. Well that lets us know it's not
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:18.120]  our government when they sign a secret deal 11 years ago to steal the death
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.960]  benefits of vets that have paid for it I mean these are criminal isn't the word
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:29.960]  this is a illegitimate group of scumbag robbers that runs thing I mean we're
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:35.200]  in deep trouble here folks if they'll rob the vets death benefits and they've
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.720]  got the veterans organizations paid off standing down what else will they do what
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:46.600]  else are they doing we don't know about they'll do anything they'll do anything
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:50.160]  let's talk to Anthony in Arizona Anthony you're on the air with Bob Chapman
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:55.440]  hello Alex hey buddy hey what's going on I'm calling from you
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:59.120]  Arizona actually Marine Corps air station you know yes I'm in range you
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.000]  want to do your research on that I would actually want to talk about the
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.600]  federal reserve system and their money market system okay go ahead you're on
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.440]  the air with Bob Chapman okay now with the money market system and the federal
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:17.440]  reserve system our money is pretty much worthless is that agreeable I agree with
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:24.320]  you all right now let's now under article 1 section 10 no stage I'll enter
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:28.280]  into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letters and etc and
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:33.320]  one point says make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:37.800]  debts yes it's unconstitutional and illegal the whole federal reserve system
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:44.960]  is alien to our republic okay so what if a Marine were to let's say sue the
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:51.840]  government saying that his contracts were in fact illegal from the get-go well
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:56.360]  the Bob what do you think will happen with that well I think first of all
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:01.960]  you've got to talk to an attorney who might specialize close to that area I
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:08.600]  certainly can't answer that that's dangerous for yourself and I've been
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:13.880]  there and so I know the rules that you have to operate under as a military
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:20.960]  person and so I would get expert legal advice before I tried anything like that
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:29.120]  I see all right well see the I don't know whether you've had him on Alex but the
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:36.520]  captain who refused to take an order because he said the president wasn't
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:41.840]  an American citizen and he couldn't be president and so they threw him in jail
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:48.040]  and they're gonna court-martial him so you you've got to be on pretty solid
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:52.720]  ground before you do anything to challenge absolutely Anthony thank you
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.080]  for the call interesting points in closing for this segment we're gonna
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:00.280]  come back into some really incredible new information on the Oklahoma City
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:03.680]  front with Jesse trying to do Bob Chapman will ride shotgun with us as we
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:06.880]  examine these important new developments proving that criminal elements in the

[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:02.360]  been able to discover and confirm that elaheem city was a government
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:06.680]  operation with the southern property law center we've interviewed the former
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:11.160]  head of hud jane graham who was in the building and saw mcvay and others
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:14.600]  planning gray sticks of butter with wires saying they were a telephone company
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:19.080]  the day before i mean it just the witnesses go on and on tarence yakey

[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:25.640]  know bandages up to a doctor in front of him and they weren't even in the
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:29.800]  building and lied about it the list goes on and on you have high level fbi
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:33.560]  agents and i'll get into that coming up who said they were in dallas but turned
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:36.440]  out we're in oklahoma city the day before
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:41.000]  you've got now sworn affidavits by people
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:46.200]  involved like terry nickles saying yes mcvay was a government agent i mean all
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:52.520]  of this is happening but now there's a new report out here
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:56.840]  thanks to trinity's research and lawsuits discovering that indeed there
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:35:00.840]  was a call made to the alfred p mara building saying don't be there
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:03.960]  in the days before and that's why a lot of people weren't in the building that
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:08.040]  day like the atf and bob Chapman an expert obviously
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:11.480]  researching this case writing with a shotgun today he'll also have some
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:15.160]  questions or comments but jesse trying to do kind of recap
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:19.560]  the saga and the big bomb shells and let's get into the new one
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:22.840]  well i think it's all been first of all just don't thank you for having me on
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:26.040]  again you bet and it started with the murder of my
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:29.800]  brother uh my brother was picked up for the so-called
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:34.440]  parole violation in southern california sent immediately to oklahoma city
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:38.600]  two days later the federal government said he committed suicide and they tried
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:41.960]  to have his body cremated we fought very hard to get his
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:46.520]  body returned to us his throat was cut uh they said he's hanging himself his
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:49.880]  throat was cut his head was smashed open to three places
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:53.720]  it's been beaten head to toe front to back even the soles of his feet
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:57.880]  have been beaten uh we never had a motive for why they
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:03.880]  killed him and then shortly before he was executed
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.040]  i get a message from tim mcbay that said when i saw your brother's picture
[02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:13.000]  and heard what happened to him i wanted to know that he was killed by the fbi
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.160]  um they mistook him for richard league guffrey
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.600]  uh and guffrey was the person i believe is john doe too
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:24.040]  guffrey about a year after my brother's murder ended up
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.520]  supposedly hanging himself while in the custody of the fbi
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:32.040]  and we had a witness to my brother's murder and uh month before we went to
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:38.120]  trial they found him hanging in his cell while under federal custody but
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:43.240]  to cut to the the core of it that apparently my brother
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:47.560]  matched richard league guffrey in the description that the fbi was circulating
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:51.480]  for john doe too it was a white male five foot nine
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:55.720]  powerful upper bodybuild dark complexed believed to be in canada
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:00.760]  mexico driving 1986 chevrolet pickup truck and a dragon tattoo on his left
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:04.200]  forearm my brother came that was a perfect match
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:07.080]  of my brother he was coming back across the border in san diego
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:12.120]  been down into mexico he was driving his friends 1986 chevrolet pickup truck
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:16.200]  he was five foot nine powerful upper bodybuild dark complexed
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.720]  dragon tattooed left forearm stopped arrested
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:26.040]  sent to Oklahoma and dead two days later but i've once i knew that i started
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:30.520]  to try to find some link between uh guffrey
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:35.400]  it was it even looked like my brother and the oklahoma city bombing and i
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:38.680]  didn't start out to solve yet oklahoma city bombing i started out to
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:43.640]  find out who killed my brother why but everything i did took me to
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:49.160]  oklahoma city in the bomb and fortunately that i've been able to do me a
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:53.320]  favor jesse talk right into your telephone for us i am yes i just speak up
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.680]  for us because some of it's trailing off please continue
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:00.360]  well i started to sue the the government under the federal pre-information act
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:04.520]  to get records and among the first records i got were
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:08.920]  uh a series of teletypes from fbi director louis free
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.560]  to fbi officers in oklahoma and around certain locations around the country
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:18.600]  talking about uh mcbay had called ellim city two days before the bombing
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:23.960]  and had asked for more help and an informant had intercepted that call
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:28.280]  and warned the fb and advised the fbi i had
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:31.800]  a document that showed that a government informant
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.640]  had actually gone to oklahoma city with mcbay and scouted the target
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:41.560]  four months before the bombing and i sued for records involving the cia
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:45.880]  and the cia it shouldn't be involved in the oklahoma city bombing case
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:50.440]  because it is a foreign intelligence service and it's illegal for it to be
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.200]  operating in the united states and for the first time
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:59.480]  i came but they came back and the cia claimed a national security they said
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:03.240]  it would be a grave threat to the national security united states if they
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.880]  released the records and that's one of the exemptions the
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:11.080]  government has that they don't have to turn over anything is that
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:15.640]  it would jeopardize national security but i i think that one in the world
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.800]  is the cia doing uh looking at this white supremacist camp
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:24.440]  in oklahoma city all right now now let's go through some of what you've
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:28.200]  discovered since then it's it's been confirmed even major
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:33.640]  newspapers like the la times reported that uh more than uh 14 video tapes from
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:37.160]  different um buildings were all confiscated when people sued to get
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:39.560]  them yourself included they claim that all the
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:43.960]  tapes were being changed at the same time at the ymca at banks savings and
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:47.160]  loans i mean if you believe that i got a bridge i'll sell you
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.240]  also uh former fbi task force director danie coulson
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:55.320]  had claimed he was in dalis on april 19th 95 and flew up there but there was no
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.840]  record of that then we have the hotel receipt of him at the marion
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:03.480]  the day before being in oklahoma city you add that to the fray
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:07.560]  you've got all these documents you've sued and gotten as best you can tell
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:10.280]  from your research and this new information you're about to cover
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:14.920]  what really happened in oklahoma city well
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:18.200]  i think it's now apparent that it was some kind of
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:23.080]  government operation whether mcbay was actually working for the government
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:28.280]  originally and then went uh rogue on him or whether it was planned all along i
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:32.760]  don't know but the fbi had at least four or five
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:37.240]  informants involved with this operation that you in advance it was going to
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:40.280]  happen and once it happened they did everything in the
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:46.520]  world they could to cover it up the uh
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:50.840]  i'm trying to think of the some of the more crucial things that that involved
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:54.200]  i mean there's just so much evidence it's totally ridiculous and now we see
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:56.760]  all these obama advisors saying they need another
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:00.680]  oklahoma city because it'll help obama like it did clinton
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.120]  and even glenn beck has come out and said he believes they're preparing a new
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:07.880]  oklahoma city to be blamed on the liberty movement were you aware of him
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:10.600]  saying that two months ago i was not aware of that but
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:13.880]  i want to go back you mentioned a very important thing i sued to get the
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:17.480]  surveillance tapes around on the mural building the
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:21.400]  surveillance cameras actually on a building that was destroyed and the
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:26.360]  surveillance cameras tapes from the roads leading up to the building
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:30.440]  i get all the tapes except the one for the mural building but the tapes they
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:36.520]  give me go blank at various times between 854 and 902 when the bomb went off
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:39.720]  so i have six or seven different buildings where
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:44.040]  when a vehicle would be passing specifically the bomb
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:48.360]  truck in a with the rider truck the tape goes blank
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:51.720]  and you know further up the road a little later
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:59.080]  that tape goes blank so in essence 26 tapes that i received go blank at
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:04.680]  various times between 854 and 902 on april 19 1995
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:08.280]  and the government united states says well that's because the tapes were being
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:15.640]  changed so it's savings and loans and and ymca's and businesses
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:19.880]  everywhere they're magically being being changed in that two-minute period
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:23.400]  that's basically what they said but more importantly
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:27.080]  they don't give me the tapes from the mural building and i had been leaked the
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.040]  secret service guideline a timeline that said
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:33.960]  surveillance cameras showed the bomb detonating three minutes
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:38.600]  in six seconds after the suspect accident the vehicle
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:43.880]  now that was the mural building camera tapes uh i've sued against those no one
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:46.600]  has ever seen those outside of the fbi to my knowledge
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:50.200]  and an fbi agent told the washington times and la times
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:53.960]  he's seen them and it shows mcvay with other people
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:43:01.640]  yes and the government the fbi specifically says they can't find
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:04.520]  now the most important evidence you would think
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:08.200]  that would have been exhibit one in a prosecution of tim mcday
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.040]  tape showing him coming up to the driving the truck up to the building
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.720]  setting the timer getting out of the truck walking away and the bomb going
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:19.960]  off they didn't use that tape the reason they didn't use it is because it has
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:23.800]  other people getting out of that truck one or more of whom was probably an
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.240]  informant which is what all the witnesses said anyways
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:30.280]  but they're telling us to forget about that i want to get into the new
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:32.920]  information here in a moment but i wanted to bring bob
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:36.680]  Chapman in who's followed this closely guest hosting with us in this hour
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:39.480]  bob what's your comments on what you're hearing any questions for jesse trying
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:43.480]  to do i think it's pretty cut and cut and
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:50.680]  cut and dried what they've done and uh it's been my opinion that
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:54.840]  the uh... the thing was set up by the united states government
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:59.400]  and mcday uh... was a key matter uh... working with the government
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:05.480]  uh... on this project uh... i would parallel it with nine eleven
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:08.280]  and they burned and they burned their own guy like they always do like lee
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:11.400]  harvey oswald that's right
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.760]  and it's just like when uh... the government's uh...
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:19.160]  takeover from another government uh... the first thing they do is get rid of
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:23.240]  the people who put them into power because they're too dangerous
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:28.120]  but uh... it's pretty obvious now uh... from what this gentleman is telling us
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:32.600]  and what we know from before that uh...
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:36.920]  the united states government did perform this operation
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.920]  and sort of related just like nine eleven everything will come up
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:44.440]  and uh... hopefully these people think that they'll
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:49.320]  they'll outlast it and they'll die before it's discovered
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:53.160]  in total of what they've done just like north was just like tonkin just like
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:57.000]  operation a jacks or operation gladio if our criminal government would blow up
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  school buses and trains in italy in nineteen eighty one
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:04.360]  to blame their political enemies would they do it here i mean that's a no
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:07.240]  brainer and they've been caught with their pants down now the new stuff
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:10.360]  you've gotten in the last few years via lawsuits
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.520]  uh... is depositions with terry nickles confirming what others said mcvay was a
[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:15.720]  government agent
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:18.920]  uh... he's videotaped at a base a year after he's out of the military at a
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:19.800]  demolitions
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.080]  base you've got the driver truck being loaded at camp grouper
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:25.960]  uh... you've got the southern property law center fb i running
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:30.360]  elaheem city the command base uh... and you've got a where you've sued and gotten
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:33.240]  different documents where they black it out then you're able to get at the same
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:36.360]  document other areas blacked out put it together
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:41.320]  but tell folks about the new information dealing with the phone call warning
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:44.040]  that all the witnesses reported on hearing about what the building was more
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:47.720]  than half empty but it wasn't empty at that daycare center they made sure they
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:51.480]  picked something so we could see some bloody dead kids on tv so they could
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:55.400]  demonize the state's rights movement
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:58.840]  what happened is i i sued the fb i to get
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:01.000]  uh...
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.360]  under the previous information act request records
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:07.880]  of the evidence found in terry nichols home in
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.280]  kansas about two thousand five the fb i
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.720]  went to the former home of terry nichols in herrington kansas
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.200]  went into the basement in the crawl space and found a box of explosives
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:23.560]  and i wanted those the box of explosives because i had interviewed
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:28.280]  nichols and he told me the information about those explosives that
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:33.880]  uh... the fingerprints of the fb i informant who gave
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:37.560]  nichols and mcvay the detonators for the bomb speak up i'm sorry speak up sir
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:39.560]  this is too important
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:42.520]  nichols had told me during an interview private interview
[02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:45.480]  that on that box of explosives would be the fingerprints
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:48.680]  of the fb i informant who gave him the detonators
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:52.440]  and that this box contained some more detonators used them that were used to
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:55.960]  the part of which were used to the bomb
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:58.760]  nichols had originally tried to get this information out
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:02.280]  to homeland security because he wanted homeland security to do the fingerprint
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:05.560]  check and announce the names of the people's prints
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.160]  found on that box the fb i found out about it
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:13.400]  and uh... rated the home and got the box but before they
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:17.160]  did that back when mcvay was standing trial in
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:23.560]  oklahoma city for murder uh... an fb i
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.320]  i guess agent or operative for lack of a brother word
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:31.640]  approached nichols and his defense team
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:35.720]  and said we will promise you you will not be executed
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:39.720]  if you agree to three things and they both said well how can you guarantee
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.200]  that i won't be convicted and execute and they said we will not cooperate
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:47.160]  with the state of oklahoma we will not give them witnesses we will not give
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.760]  them evidence and they won't be able to prosecute you
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:54.680]  nichols says what do i have to do the first thing they said to him is
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:59.400]  you have to take credit for a phone call that was made to us
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:02.680]  the day before the bombing warning about the bomb
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:06.280]  and nichols told me he said i never made that call
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:09.640]  i didn't even know about that call and i told him i didn't
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:12.920]  now what that tells me is there's a record of a phone call
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:16.680]  to the fb i warning about the bombing probably from one of their informants
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:19.880]  with mcvay and they can't get rid of that record so they needed to
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:24.920]  establish uh... someone to take responsibility for
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:29.960]  nichols says what's the second thing and they said well we want you to implicate
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.640]  your brother in the box and nichols said i won't do that because he wasn't
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:37.400]  involved nichols says what's the third thing
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:41.880]  and they said where is the box of explosives you took from the home of
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:47.240]  ronnie jimore in uh... arkansas
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:51.080]  and no one would have known about the box of explosives
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:56.120]  other than being buried in that crawlspace or or in fact it has existed
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:02.040]  other than nichols and an fbi informant who was aware of it
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:08.600]  and nichols said thought they wanted evidence against ronnie jimore and this
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:11.000]  is what he's told me that's in the court records
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.800]  they said well i'll give you mr more and they said no that's not what we want
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:20.680]  we want that box of explosives and once these documents i received
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:25.800]  confirm is that meeting took place those offers were made
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.200]  the fbi later learns that the existence of that box of explosives and nichols
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:33.400]  former home gets there ahead of homeland security
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:36.520]  and other law enforcement takes the box
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:43.000]  uh... destroys the blasting camps and dead natives
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.560]  so that they couldn't be anyway linked to what may have been used to the bombing
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:52.520]  but they do do a fingerprint analysis of the box
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:56.600]  and it turns out that mcvay's prints are on the box
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:00.280]  nichols prints are on the box and fingerprints from two other individuals
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:04.600]  they will not identify were on the box of explosives
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:09.080]  and mcvay told and he fits the m o of this nichols and others and sworn
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:12.680]  affidavits now that he was part of a black op team
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:16.040]  basically infiltrating militias counterterrorism
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:19.720]  but then it shifted to they were going to do some type of drill bomb
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:24.760]  or or or test and then they just basically went and then set mcvay up
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:28.040]  uh... which is what they classically do correct
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:32.520]  it has all the earmarks of having been a government operation or it's not
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:35.000]  an operation that's certainly one they knew about
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:39.240]  and we're on top of it almost at the beginning
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.640]  and then months and then months later terence yakey cop of the year

[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:36.920]  into the international forecaster.com's our guest jesse
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:41.560]  trunner do a lawyer his brother was brutally tortured murdered
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:46.680]  by the fbi and custody and his jail cell uh joins us uh bob you've been hearing
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:51.640]  this new incredible information and there it is hanging out in plain view i mean
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:54.600]  if we don't expose these government sponsored terror events
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.840]  they're going to continue to stage them aren't they they certainly are
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:04.200]  and uh whether we deter them uh remains to be seen
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:08.520]  uh it's reflected in what you talk about and i talk about
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.360]  as far as the arrogance and the transparency
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:15.960]  of all of the things that they're doing all of the time ranging
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:22.040]  from wall speak to uh black op events and it
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:26.920]  i think that you know the history of the os s and then the cia
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:31.160]  and in these latter years in the fbi latter years being
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:39.560]  perhaps since 1970 uh the whole spectrum of agencies within government
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:44.360]  has changed tremendously i think aran contra taught us that
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:48.520]  and uh you know everybody gets away with everything
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:51.880]  and the people who have to be eliminated eliminated
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:56.040]  and the public doesn't want to know so why not take all the veterans death
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:00.200]  benefits why not steal the pensions why not bankrupt the country why not
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:03.640]  have the tsa stick their hands down our pants why not have telescreens say and
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:06.680]  spy on your neighbor i mean once you give into evil
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:09.800]  we've had 51 million abortions why not have a hundred million it's just
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:13.720]  skies the limit folks none of us are safe none of our children nothing
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.760]  this must be met head on jessie trying to do in closing
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:19.800]  any other key points you want to add about the investigation
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:22.840]  where all this is going and justice for your murdered brother
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:25.720]  and the other 160 plus people they slaughtered at
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:31.640]  oklahoma city this this question and it has troubled me
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:37.160]  all this time clearly the government do clearly the government was involved
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:40.600]  i don't know whether they intended to stop it they got away
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:46.680]  or they planned and i i i don't know but they knew it was
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:50.840]  going to happen they assisted i don't know if the plan was to stop it with
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:55.080]  cameras running and become heroes and became some respect from american
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:59.240]  people or if they actually intended to kill
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:03.400]  well then we know they killed your brother and terence yakey and a bunch of
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.440]  other medical people that saw the truth i mean
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:09.880]  you know we know i mean i mean there's no doubt they carried the whole
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:14.920]  stinking thing out the blame on the american people it wasn't to be heroes
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:20.360]  well they certainly killed the people after the fact to cover it up
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:25.400]  but before the fact they were they were responsible for the
