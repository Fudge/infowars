[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-up you want answers well so does he
[00:12.720 --> 00:41.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.040 --> 00:46.720]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome thank you for joining us on this worldwide
[00:46.720 --> 00:53.280]  transmission against tyranny it is the 19th day of December 2006 it is a
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.400]  Tuesday I had some guests lined up today but I've decided as I do on a routine
[00:58.400 --> 01:01.880]  basis to go ahead and cancel them because I want to have time to cover the
[01:01.880 --> 01:06.160]  news and some of the important issues that face humanity as we fight the
[01:06.160 --> 01:11.840]  global overlords of the new world order we'll have wide open phones whatever
[01:11.840 --> 01:19.840]  issue whatever story whatever news item you wish you discuss 1-800-259-9231
[01:19.840 --> 01:27.960]  1-800-259-9231 a story here that's been getting a lot of attention was an
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.120]  article written by Jerome Corsi for human events and a clone of it for
[01:34.120 --> 01:40.000]  all that daily North American Union leader says merger just a crisis away
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.480]  leading intellectual force behind effort towards EU style unity looks at
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.000]  future and he says one more 9-11 attack and we'll have our full North American
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.200]  Union that's the same thing that basically General Tommy Franks when he
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.680]  was on the secret payroll as a propagandist for the White House after he
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.600]  got out of the military said oh it's sad but it's what's going to happen it's
[02:04.600 --> 02:09.240]  what the people want an end of the Constitution a military dictatorship
[02:09.240 --> 02:19.400]  after one more attack and I remember on Nightline the Wednesday a week after
[02:19.400 --> 02:29.160]  9-11 what eight nine days after 9-11 UN General McKenzie the former head of UN
[02:29.160 --> 02:33.400]  peacekeeping forces he just gotten out of the UN was on Nightline and he said
[02:33.400 --> 02:40.080]  the answer is a North American continental security perimeter operated and
[02:40.080 --> 02:47.880]  run by I for international UN force I saw it with my own two eyeballs heard it
[02:47.880 --> 02:53.480]  with my own two little ears and now they have pushed North American Union in the
[02:53.480 --> 02:59.200]  name of security Homeland Security took over most of the federal agencies and
[02:59.200 --> 03:07.720]  through SPP which is the US chair of it being Michael Chertoff through that
[03:07.720 --> 03:11.960]  system they claim that getting rid of our borders is what is going to give us
[03:11.960 --> 03:17.920]  security that's why US forces will man the Mexican port facility down on
[03:17.920 --> 03:28.840]  Mexico's west coast Mexico will be given the Kansas City inland port US and
[03:28.840 --> 03:34.680]  Mexican forces will be up in Canada and this is just one way they merge our
[03:34.680 --> 03:44.760]  countries we're already inside the North American Union we're already inside
[03:44.760 --> 03:53.400]  this system and there's still massive denial on the subject so I would suggest
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.600]  to callers I would hope you know we don't screen your calls and you can bring
[03:57.600 --> 04:03.440]  up whatever issue you'd like or news story you'd like but I would suggest that
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.200]  we talk about the North American Union to be merged with the Pan American Union
[04:08.200 --> 04:15.600]  and then merge with the other two Asian and EU unions this is the official
[04:15.600 --> 04:22.520]  public plan but still the general public isn't aware of it it's been in quite a
[04:22.520 --> 04:27.640]  few newspapers on a few national TV shows and on C-SPAN as CFR members brag
[04:27.640 --> 04:34.440]  about the destruction of the country and crow like a bunch of Gamecocks but
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.120]  still on any given day you type North American Union into Google you'll get a
[04:38.120 --> 04:44.560]  handful of mainstream articles there should be hundreds so we'll cover this
[04:44.560 --> 04:49.320]  get into the Democrats wanting to expand the war of course as we said they would
[04:49.320 --> 04:54.800]  and a lot more I'm Alex Jones the websites are info wars dot net Jones
[04:54.800 --> 05:03.240]  report commons info wars dot com the Genesis Communications radio network
[05:03.240 --> 05:10.720]  probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[05:15.560 --> 05:23.320]  well a top bioweapons expert has gone public in the last week saying clearly
[05:23.320 --> 05:28.400]  the anthrax attacks are an inside job launched by our federal government as a
[05:28.400 --> 05:35.280]  pretext for a total police state in America we've had this video surface
[05:35.280 --> 05:38.840]  that clearly in the voice prints been done by a major university professor it's
[05:38.840 --> 05:43.440]  clearly McVeigh years after a year and a half after he supposedly left the
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.760]  military people are asking why is that so important because we always knew he
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.920]  was in a secret military project we knew he was involved with Iraq he's that
[05:50.920 --> 05:54.560]  were in a secret US government project and we know that he was basically a
[05:54.560 --> 06:00.160]  patsy just like Lee Harvey Oswald was a US government agent and was coded in the
[06:00.160 --> 06:05.520]  CIA registry as an agent and that that was a staged event as well this is
[06:05.520 --> 06:09.400]  this is huge news we have Hillary coming out and saying well I wouldn't have
[06:09.400 --> 06:16.840]  voted for the war four years ago but I'm still for the war now that we're there
[06:16.840 --> 06:21.640]  and I wouldn't have changed my vote so weird double-speak there if you can
[06:21.640 --> 06:27.040]  figure that out and she wants 30,000 more troops and she wants to go into she
[06:27.040 --> 06:32.720]  wants to go ahead and go into Iran so this is the type of behavior we're
[06:32.720 --> 06:37.240]  witnessing by the Democrats the armed services committee chairman that's
[06:37.240 --> 06:43.240]  coming in who doesn't know who the Shiites are he thinks they're Al Qaeda when
[06:43.240 --> 06:47.360]  it's the opposite group even if you believe the fairy tale he wants 30,000
[06:47.360 --> 06:53.520]  more troops and Democratic constituency the main line is saying let's just
[06:53.520 --> 06:58.520]  continue the war now as long as Democrats are running it everything's fine and the
[06:58.520 --> 07:03.240]  Iraq study group has done their job there they've depoliticized it they have
[07:03.240 --> 07:07.680]  quote put it into this political process where it can be drug out for year
[07:07.680 --> 07:12.440]  after year while the defense contractors make their profits and there's the
[07:12.440 --> 07:16.440]  story getting a lot of attention where North American Union leader says the
[07:16.440 --> 07:21.240]  merger just a crisis away American University professor Robert pastor who I
[07:21.240 --> 07:27.120]  want to get on the broadcast big CFR member helped write the the document
[07:27.120 --> 07:33.520]  which was basically word-for-word put into law by executive fiat last March and
[07:33.520 --> 07:39.040]  then expanded last December by Bush Paul Martin and Vicente Fox in Waco towards
[07:39.040 --> 07:43.160]  the North American community he says one more big terror attack and that's how
[07:43.160 --> 07:48.120]  we'll get our North American Union selling it that that that no borders
[07:48.120 --> 07:56.320]  equals security so I want to break down that report also the US is planning a
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.640]  Persian Gulf build-up as a warning to Iran this being reported by several big
[08:00.640 --> 08:06.120]  newspapers and the drugs report as well as CBS planning a Gulf build-up but this
[08:06.120 --> 08:13.040]  is the biggest and naval build-up we've ever seen in modern history since the
[08:13.040 --> 08:18.240]  British blockade of the Suez Canal they've got four carrier task force
[08:18.240 --> 08:23.520]  groups there to give you an idea how big this is on the launch of Gulf War one
[08:23.520 --> 08:28.440]  they had three carriers and Gulf War two they had three carriers biggest build-up
[08:28.440 --> 08:36.040]  by the US ever ever and open discussions by the neocons of just going
[08:36.040 --> 08:44.200]  ahead and having the lame duck bush launch an attack unbelievable unbelievable
[08:44.200 --> 08:48.600]  type report Annie war comes out with a headline that I agree with Hillary
[08:48.600 --> 08:55.600]  Clinton war goddess she wants permanent bases in Iraq and threatens war with Iran
[08:55.600 --> 09:02.240]  also report here RFID passports cloned within five minutes is they are designed
[09:02.240 --> 09:06.920]  for identity theft that's why our passport system has gone over to this by
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.520]  law starting January 1st but already this year everybody I've talked to is
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.960]  getting passports have the RFID embedded in them we'll break down that
[09:15.960 --> 09:23.920]  report hockey player fired for not signing a flag for US troops also Litvinenko
[09:23.920 --> 09:31.680]  killers use plutonium worth 10 million to give massive overdose and Litvinenko's
[09:31.680 --> 09:34.760]  father thinks the Russian government killed him Litvinenko on his deathbed
[09:34.760 --> 09:38.120]  said the Russian government killed him but people don't want to listen to what
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.200]  he's saying on his deathbed they think he would just just just lie and say that
[09:43.200 --> 09:50.120]  to to to blame an innocent party that's mental gymnastics there's some evidence
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.320]  the oligarchs could have done it but it's clear Litvinenko and his father
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.560]  think that Putin did it but according to some Putin is this wonderful creature
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.520]  here to help us and Russia's a good friend and and just again Russia's does
[10:03.520 --> 10:08.160]  no wrong it's it's it's all Israel no other evil on earth is ever engaged in
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.000]  not in China not in Russia it's only Israel they are they are the only group
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.840]  that is capable of engaging in sin if you slip on a banana peel if you get
[10:21.840 --> 10:27.760]  lung cancer if you have an automobile accident it's sure to be done by Israel
[10:27.760 --> 10:33.960]  which again neutralizes any real debate and creates a red herring again I'm not
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.840]  defending Israel here I just get tired of everything being Israel instantly again
[10:39.840 --> 10:44.160]  I don't know who killed Litvinenko but more and more evidence leans towards
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.280]  Russia and I know we're told this has been to frame Putin Putin doesn't care
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.160]  he wants people to know he's having them killed he wants intimidation I mean
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.040]  speaking of Russia digressing here for a moment there's big reports out from
[10:59.040 --> 11:04.200]  New York to LA where there are protest video police grabbing people's cameras
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.840]  saying get those cameras they steal people's cameras they do it on video
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.360]  while others tape it they don't care they put people in free speech zones where
[11:14.360 --> 11:20.120]  no one can even see what they're saying or doing or no press can cover them this
[11:20.120 --> 11:23.560]  is done to frustrate protest well the same thing happened over the weekend in
[11:23.560 --> 11:28.800]  Moscow a few thousand people bravely showed up to protest against Putin in
[11:28.800 --> 11:32.680]  his police state and before they could get out of their cars or buses they were
[11:32.680 --> 11:38.200]  arrested by the hundreds and beaten by riot police because quote they didn't
[11:38.200 --> 11:45.320]  have a permit and they wouldn't go to designated free speech zones but but oh
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.120]  our press was oh this shows what a police state Russia is and how bad they are
[11:49.120 --> 11:53.720]  and you're darn right they're bad you see instead of just running over them with
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.320]  tanks or beating them in the streets like they do in China now it's put into a
[11:57.320 --> 12:03.160]  process see it's a process of tyranny oh you didn't get your your permit oh we
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.960]  wouldn't issue you a permit oh and you've got to go down here down this
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.680]  alleyway and sit in a pen where nobody can see you you see that's the new
[12:10.680 --> 12:20.160]  America as well I think that's a extremely important facet to discuss
[12:20.160 --> 12:24.680]  also the Associated Press is falsely suggesting that the National Security
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.880]  Agency can eavesdrop on Americans without a warrant Bush by executive order
[12:29.880 --> 12:36.600]  has said they can do this and by memorandum but they have not yet gotten
[12:36.600 --> 12:39.760]  the law passed in Congress overturning the Fourth Amendment and even if they
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.560]  do that law is no one boy according to the Constitution Bill of Rights and the
[12:44.560 --> 12:53.520]  great body the great mass of case law but again they're creating this illusion
[12:53.520 --> 12:59.000]  now that hey you don't need you don't need a warrant anymore and we've got
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.480]  local sheriffs on television saying we've got Margo Frazier back when she
[13:03.480 --> 13:10.600]  was the jack booted you know buzz-cutted commander here locally saying we don't
[13:10.600 --> 13:14.440]  need warrants anymore I gotta find that tape oh no no no we don't need a warrant
[13:14.440 --> 13:19.000]  you know they searched a whole street bunch of houses had people sitting fire
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.800]  ants kick dogs you know we went out to the interviews when she got on the news
[13:22.800 --> 13:25.640]  they said well you didn't have a warrant she said we don't need warrants
[13:25.640 --> 13:32.720]  anymore because she said so because there was a policy she heard about you
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.560]  people are sick the borders wide open in the illegal aliens don't have to have
[13:37.560 --> 13:39.760]  IDs to get back accounts or housing loans
[13:39.760 --> 13:45.320]  I let's look let's go to your calls I want to start the broadcast early with
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.640]  your calls I love the different directions you take us on it's like
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.600]  spinning the wheel the wildcard and then all before the hour ends I'll get into
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.480]  the North American Union and in detail in some of the latest developments there
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.880]  we'll go to John then Kitty then heavy then David Johnny and others John you're
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.880]  on the air from Tennessee welcome oh Alex how you doing good hey a couple things
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.440]  one I heard on the radio this morning have you heard about the case of David
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.320]  Vance is a contractor in Iraq and he found out that the company was working
[14:18.320 --> 14:22.840]  for the Iraqi company the smuggling weapons to the insurgents and he ended
[14:22.840 --> 14:27.000]  up being kept in the prison that said I was saying is he ended up being arrested
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.080]  basically after blowing the whistle on on weapons being smuggled to the
[14:31.080 --> 14:36.920]  insurgents and and and and who was smuggling them the he worked for an
[14:36.920 --> 14:42.960]  Iraqi security company and it was the company he's an American but the company
[14:42.960 --> 14:47.040]  worked for the rocky and he found out that they were smuggling weapons to the
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.080]  surgeons and also in the New York Times report said that he saw American
[14:51.080 --> 14:56.840]  soldiers who would trade bullets for alcohol and other other things had a
[14:56.840 --> 15:02.080]  weapons repairs and I heard him on being interviewed on the NPR program on point
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.560]  this morning and it was kind of kind of really crazy how some of the like the
[15:06.560 --> 15:09.880]  lawyer that was arguing for the other side was saying well he was in a war
[15:09.880 --> 15:13.460]  zone and so it means he doesn't have any rights and but he got picked up at the
[15:13.460 --> 15:18.040]  US Embassy so someone called in and made the point wasn't the US Embassy
[15:18.040 --> 15:23.440]  American soil and the lawyer didn't said well I'm not sure if that's true or not
[15:23.440 --> 15:29.320]  but he was in a war zone and I did I did I so they took to the gun from thing
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.280]  that Iraq is in terror well that's what they do that's what they do they take a
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.560]  huge story that shows that our government the Israelis the British are
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.240]  busy arming quote the insurgency to keep the war going I haven't seen this new
[15:42.240 --> 15:45.960]  report but it fits him with all the past literally hundreds of reports
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.760]  confirmed of this and then they spin it into oh this just shows how things are
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.680]  how things are crumbling and then and then our government you're saying
[15:54.680 --> 16:00.920]  allowed an American citizen to be hauled off to the the Baghdad Airport there I
[16:00.920 --> 16:04.480]  could I can email you the report but I'm sure I can type his name into Google
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.120]  News and and finally say his name is Robert Vance David Vance and also on
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.360]  point had had a visit a radio archive of his have been being interviewed on the
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.920]  radio this morning also okay what was the final point you're gonna make about
[16:15.920 --> 16:21.200]  this well that was all about this and but also you're asking about the North
[16:21.200 --> 16:24.600]  American Union there's some news here in Tennessee I saw in the newspaper about a
[16:24.600 --> 16:27.520]  month or so ago they're gonna they're trying to bring the toll roads here now
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.120]  using the argument that they're not getting enough money from the from the
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.360]  gasoline tax and that's they're gonna be there their main taxing mechanism okay
[16:36.360 --> 16:41.240]  thank you I'll comment on that when we get back at it you know simultaneously
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.280]  they're announcing that existing roads are gonna be toll roads and then if you
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.480]  read the fine print almost in all cases it's far and owned and we're going into
[16:49.480 --> 16:54.280]  receivership and even a lot of patriots don't want to admit how bad it is we
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.200]  have to admit how bad it is to then set about fixing it we'll be right back
[16:58.200 --> 17:00.760]  stay with us
[17:00.760 --> 17:16.440]  come your master who's war is a bill the big guns is a bill that explains is a
[17:16.440 --> 17:30.240]  bill all the bombs is hide behind walls is hide behind this I just don't want you
[17:30.240 --> 17:38.040]  to know I can see to your man welcome back you that never done nothing yeah the
[17:38.040 --> 17:42.000]  caller mentioned that in Tennessee it's in their paper how great it is and how
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.640]  wonderful it is and whether you live in Austin Texas or Knoxville Tennessee or
[17:47.640 --> 17:52.960]  if you live in Boise Idaho it it doesn't matter Los Angeles California or New
[17:52.960 --> 17:59.720]  York it's the same article there's not as much gas tax money and the roads are
[17:59.720 --> 18:06.800]  falling apart and there's no money and we've got to have a toll road tax on
[18:06.800 --> 18:14.680]  existing roads and on new roads to fund it well number one we have the Texas
[18:14.680 --> 18:18.120]  Department Transportation documents California Department Transportation
[18:18.120 --> 18:22.920]  documents they've all come out that they are making record amounts of money now
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.360]  you don't need their documents to know that if we're using 15 million barrels
[18:26.360 --> 18:31.040]  of oil a decade ago and they're using 22 23 million barrels a day and growing
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.440]  every year and you can read the gross receipts they are just astronomical and
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.000]  the text dot document that came out about a year and a half ago was in the
[18:39.000 --> 18:46.160]  paper locally said that it was text dot internally and it said you know this is
[18:46.160 --> 18:51.800]  for your eyes only not for distribution this is restricted and and they
[18:51.800 --> 18:56.200]  reported on it and it said we've got tons of money we've got huge surpluses
[18:56.200 --> 19:00.720]  why are we doing this and why are we selling off roads that we've just built
[19:00.720 --> 19:06.360]  a road we've already just redone to this company and why is it for such a small
[19:06.360 --> 19:11.800]  sum and now people in the agency is high up that ask questions like that you are
[19:11.800 --> 19:15.000]  just you know but think they should be doing their job but you know having a
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.320]  good service and you don't understand you didn't hear Joseph Sticklitz on the
[19:19.320 --> 19:24.600]  show a month ago did you this is when a country goes into receivership the the
[19:24.600 --> 19:30.120]  assets the infrastructures are handed over for almost nothing remember
[19:30.120 --> 19:37.000]  Sticklitz said they're basically given the foreign corporations see government
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.120]  going back to the fifties to set up the metro systems and cities and counties
[19:43.120 --> 19:48.840]  and states and then federal agencies and water districts began taking the lion
[19:48.840 --> 19:55.920]  share of the tax revenue and they began investing it in the stock market and in
[19:55.920 --> 20:02.120]  and in private companies as well until 75 per plus percent I keep saying 70
[20:02.120 --> 20:06.400]  75 plus percent that's the latest numbers out from Walter Birian and others
[20:06.400 --> 20:11.560]  the former auditor of the Air Force has also gone public and done his own
[20:11.560 --> 20:16.560]  analysis it's found 70 plus percent and and and so what happens is the
[20:16.560 --> 20:20.560]  corporations get key people into office key city managers in key school
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.360]  district managers they then invest the money they then revolving door back and
[20:25.360 --> 20:29.600]  forth between government going up the ladder into higher and higher corporate
[20:29.600 --> 20:33.360]  structures and then they're getting you know million dollar five hundred thousand
[20:33.360 --> 20:37.520]  two million dollar a year salaries and then they'll rotate back in and get a
[20:37.520 --> 20:40.960]  hundred thousand a year in a city and then they'll for a few years and then
[20:40.960 --> 20:44.800]  they'll rotate back in you know that's why a politician will spend twenty
[20:44.800 --> 20:48.800]  million dollars to get into office as a congressman you know to get paid a
[20:48.800 --> 20:55.080]  hundred something thousand a year and so it's a it's an open delayed kick back
[20:55.080 --> 21:00.120]  in that revolving door and so the corporations the global corporations
[21:00.120 --> 21:05.600]  have bought up the entire stock market with your own money and then they like
[21:05.600 --> 21:10.280]  to rip off stockholders every few decades with Enron or global crossing where
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.400]  you'll see them start moving the assets out of a big dummy corporation so
[21:14.400 --> 21:17.760]  because anyone let you stockholders low level stockholders have a piece of the
[21:17.760 --> 21:21.840]  action then they blow that out like the mafia because they are the mafia and then
[21:21.840 --> 21:25.680]  move that into other assets and then if you invest too heavily in that and
[21:25.680 --> 21:32.880]  they'll blow that out it's all about total consolidation and that's what your
[21:32.880 --> 21:37.480]  comprehensive annual financial reports are about and so now they've got 75% of
[21:37.480 --> 21:43.320]  the stock market now they're going to raise taxes to a point and devalue your
[21:43.320 --> 21:47.160]  dollar to a point and blow out some of the places you were still able to invest
[21:47.160 --> 21:55.800]  the the dollar sink of real estate until you're totally destitute that's the
[21:55.800 --> 22:02.240]  goal destroy middle class destroy independent assets so instead of 75%
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.320]  they've got even more and so now they've got all this money and all the all this
[22:06.320 --> 22:10.160]  power with your tax money and so now they just go in with the politicians they
[22:10.160 --> 22:13.960]  own and the politicians they've lobbied and they have the politicians for
[22:13.960 --> 22:20.120]  pennies on the dollar sign over with no liability the roads the water of the
[22:20.120 --> 22:25.400]  lakes management of the borders the police police are going private in
[22:25.400 --> 22:33.040]  some areas they legalize mercenaries domestically total bondage total bondage
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.440]  see it isn't about a free market they're just rounding up the last few pools of
[22:38.440 --> 22:44.240]  capital right now then when they've got you where they want you the one-child
[22:44.240 --> 22:51.040]  policy starts the sterilization starts the extermination starts we're on the
[22:51.040 --> 22:59.120]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[22:59.120 --> 23:12.560]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[23:12.560 --> 23:35.400]  all right I'm gonna go back to hitting heavy David Johnny John others but let
[23:35.400 --> 23:44.520]  me just say this I got some friends that go way back they're nice folks and
[23:44.520 --> 23:48.960]  they're a little cable TV show comes on before my little show on Monday nights
[23:48.960 --> 23:55.600]  right now and I was down at the TV station last night I'm like running
[23:55.600 --> 23:59.640]  around doing so much stuff here in the break I'm actually at a loss for breath
[23:59.640 --> 24:09.040]  how crazy it is here at this office and I'm there and I see the chairman of the
[24:09.040 --> 24:18.880]  Travis County Republican Party sitting there on this TV show and so at the end
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.040]  of the show a lot of times I'll pop on because they come on right before me and
[24:22.040 --> 24:25.800]  so when their show ends mine comes on same channel and so at the end of the
[24:25.800 --> 24:28.880]  show most weeks I'll walk in and talk about you know 60 seconds say something
[24:28.880 --> 24:34.000]  leave oh I saw the chairman of the Republican Party in there so I go in
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.880]  there and I walk up behind him and I start saying you know Bush is really a
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.640]  liberal and we need to get past this left-right paradigm and Bush is for gun
[24:42.640 --> 24:47.600]  control and Bush was used for the assault of his band and the chairman of
[24:47.600 --> 24:52.280]  the Republican Party here in Austin here in Travis County very important
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.000]  chairmanship at the state level politics he just said no he is and it's not
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.520]  true and I said and he's for the North American Union no he's not it's not true
[25:02.520 --> 25:05.560]  and he spent more money than all presidents before him combined no it's
[25:05.560 --> 25:13.400]  not true and I went on to say no it is true and then even the host who I know
[25:13.400 --> 25:20.920]  and his pro gun and knows about the new old order a conservative person started
[25:20.920 --> 25:24.880]  defending and saying well Bush said he'd signed the assault weapons ban but he
[25:24.880 --> 25:31.400]  didn't lobby for it and I've talked about that's the same thing I got when I
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.380]  was in McBride's I don't know four or five months ago six months ago whenever
[25:35.380 --> 25:45.880]  Cheney had shot the lawyer clearly at closer than then 30 feet
[25:45.880 --> 25:55.240]  well well that they claim they shot him at at 90 feet or 30 yards and our
[25:55.240 --> 25:59.240]  evidence show they shot him at at about 30 feet or closer we went out and did a
[25:59.240 --> 26:05.760]  ballistics test you know had a policeman out there an engineer others shot it into
[26:05.760 --> 26:12.760]  a latex dummy boxing dummy and I walk into McBride's to buy the same gauge
[26:12.760 --> 26:19.000]  pop gun shotgun and that Cheney has you know the same boy the same load a
[26:19.000 --> 26:27.000]  cheaper shotgun not you know not a big fancy car of $20,000 one and I'm in
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.320]  there waiting to buy it and I couldn't control myself I bought another gun for
[26:31.320 --> 26:37.960]  myself while I was in there one that wasn't just for the test I did and a
[26:37.960 --> 26:42.640]  guy comes over to me and says one of the people there at McBride's nice gun shop
[26:42.640 --> 26:48.240]  a lot of people in the a lot of salesman he says hey I heard you say Bush's was
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.920]  for the assault was banned you know that's not true and I said yeah it is
[26:52.920 --> 26:56.440]  it's it's true and he said no no I heard him give a speech saying he was for the
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.720]  Second Amendment I said yeah but what definition of the Second Amendment is
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.960]  that and I said unless prescribed by law which then they claim these laws and
[27:04.960 --> 27:10.880]  regulations supersede the Bill of Rights and he's and then a manager walks over
[27:10.880 --> 27:13.840]  and goes hey Alex how you doing fan of the show he goes yeah he's right it's
[27:13.840 --> 27:19.240]  true and the fellow looked like a deer in the headlights and it's the same thing
[27:19.240 --> 27:27.120]  with friends of mine people I know they're just in denial like I thought
[27:27.120 --> 27:30.960]  about getting Jimmy Ritter on the show today maybe we can maybe think I have a
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.800]  cell phone number at my office I know I have it at home I forgot to get it this
[27:33.800 --> 27:37.280]  morning out of the computer maybe we can call around and get Ritter's number I
[27:37.280 --> 27:44.320]  know he listens I'm know if he can get in though the lines are loaded because I
[27:44.320 --> 27:47.360]  want to have a discussion with somebody who's not a bad person and who means
[27:47.360 --> 27:52.360]  well like Jimmy's big into guns big into the Second Amendment and he was there
[27:52.360 --> 27:59.520]  going well Alex he's not really for gun control and I just don't understand it I
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.480]  mean I literally lose sleep at night I literally have trouble going to sleep
[28:02.480 --> 28:06.360]  sometimes even when I'm exhausted and I and you know it's always late at night
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.080]  it's when things are quiet that's when I tend to lose my good attitude that I
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.480]  have and my go-getter attitude and I kind of get sad and I'll you know kind of
[28:14.480 --> 28:17.960]  just sit there on the chair by my bed before I go to sleep and my literally
[28:17.960 --> 28:24.200]  with my head down just literally grieving for my country I mean it's gone
[28:24.200 --> 28:30.120]  folks the North American Union's here Bush is pushing total blanket amnesty the
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.640]  Democrats are sure to vote with him for blanket amnesty they've abolished the
[28:34.640 --> 28:39.320]  Bill of Rights the Constitution habeas corpus it's all admitted the Democrats
[28:39.320 --> 28:46.400]  are all for it now right along with Bush and I can't even get people I've known
[28:46.400 --> 28:52.600]  for 10 12 years who know all about the New World Order to even admit to
[28:52.600 --> 29:02.680]  themselves that Bush is evil and again he's just a puppet and that Republican
[29:02.680 --> 29:06.920]  party chairman in Travis County just nope nope nope nope Bush is a
[29:06.920 --> 29:17.160]  conservative but I'm a pig with wings from Pluto because it just it's it's
[29:17.160 --> 29:23.480]  like when we play the CFR clip on the internet on YouTube and there's there's
[29:23.480 --> 29:26.880]  a message board there's comments under it and there's a bunch of people and
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.120]  they're going oh Dick Cheney's anti Eastern establishment he's anti CFR
[29:31.120 --> 29:34.960]  he's anti New World Order in fact find that clip for me again I want to play
[29:34.960 --> 29:41.280]  that here in a second and then they post under it then they're serious they
[29:41.280 --> 29:47.800]  say you know what either this clip's fake or he's just joking around you know he
[29:47.800 --> 29:54.080]  didn't really mean this no no no he's against David Rockefeller the guys
[29:54.080 --> 30:00.440]  been financed since before he got into Congress by the Rockefeller crime
[30:00.440 --> 30:06.680]  syndicate the guys vacation with him they go to constant luncheons with them
[30:06.680 --> 30:10.360]  they have said their Rockefeller Republicans they're implementing it
[30:10.360 --> 30:14.080]  down the line and then he makes a joke knowing it's probably too late for
[30:14.080 --> 30:21.240]  America this bastard makes a joke about it in these people can't even see it
[30:21.240 --> 30:26.960]  when he's sitting there laughing at him in their face here it is it's good to be
[30:26.960 --> 30:31.360]  back at the council on foreign relations is Pete mentioned there's been a member
[30:31.360 --> 30:35.960]  for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time I never
[30:35.960 --> 30:44.120]  mentioned that when I was campaigning for reelection back home in Wyoming he
[30:44.120 --> 30:52.440]  never mentioned that when he was back in his state campaigning ha ha ha it's so
[30:52.440 --> 31:01.120]  funny it's hilarious the size of the Bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms
[31:01.120 --> 31:08.240]  has tripled in the last six years please don't send me an email saying I'm
[31:08.240 --> 31:12.640]  changing my story I've been saying double for the last five years I looked
[31:12.640 --> 31:17.080]  it up it's now roughly tripled it's a little under tripling you want to get
[31:17.080 --> 31:25.240]  exact the budget these goons are everywhere harassing gun dealers gun
[31:25.240 --> 31:31.040]  shops under covers at the gun shows it's horrible see I'm wedded to the second
[31:31.040 --> 31:38.920]  amendment I'm not wedded to that little pervert George W. Bush who himself is
[31:38.920 --> 31:44.800]  nothing but a puppet I mean I put my life my treasure my name everything on the
[31:44.800 --> 31:54.000]  line trying to defend this country this Republic and there are a lot of so-called
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.680]  conservatives out there a lot of them well meaning who just can't get it and
[31:59.680 --> 32:12.040]  who are not going to get it and who don't want to get it the truth is so
[32:12.040 --> 32:16.040]  scary that they can't deal with it well let me tell you something you should be
[32:16.040 --> 32:20.600]  a lot more afraid of the system we're in and the next steps in this system that
[32:20.600 --> 32:25.160]  they've told us are the next steps you better be and people say oh you got so
[32:25.160 --> 32:30.400]  much courage to do what you're doing courage I would have to have mindless
[32:30.400 --> 32:38.160]  blind courage of an just off the off the off the rails courage to know that we
[32:38.160 --> 32:45.040]  have psychopathic criminal elites who who who are putting poisons in our water
[32:45.040 --> 32:51.600]  and our medications our drugs who are destroying on purpose the fabric of
[32:51.600 --> 32:58.880]  society and saying they're doing it who run giant child and woman and even
[32:58.880 --> 33:05.840]  men for slave labor camps openly it's in major papers and nothing's done
[33:05.840 --> 33:12.720]  individuals who who have debased our currency who have completely bankrupted
[33:12.720 --> 33:17.200]  our nation and our future and then they openly say they're going to set up a
[33:17.200 --> 33:22.720]  tyranny that is very close to a mixture of the Soviet Union and and Nazi
[33:22.720 --> 33:28.680]  principles and it's the very same grandsons of the people that funded Mal
[33:28.680 --> 33:38.360]  and Hitler and Stalin I mean they don't play games these are devils that we're
[33:38.360 --> 33:46.640]  talking about as Paris said I mean I see a an array an enemy army all around us
[33:46.640 --> 33:53.480]  their dark generals laughing at us on television and then I see people who
[33:53.480 --> 33:59.240]  can't even comprehend it when it's in their face people leering at them who
[33:59.240 --> 34:04.120]  have murder in their hearts for you and your family who are openly declared war
[34:04.120 --> 34:13.360]  on you and you don't even know you don't want to know when they've declared war
[34:13.360 --> 34:20.440]  and I'm the extremist I'm the nut job I'm the guy that's crazy I shouldn't get
[34:20.440 --> 34:26.360]  upset I shouldn't be angry I should sit here and calmly report as this country
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.840]  goes down like the SS Titanic and we shouldn't even go to the lifeboats we
[34:31.840 --> 34:35.400]  shouldn't yell we shouldn't scream we shouldn't go to the rooftops and the
[34:35.400 --> 34:43.120]  hilltops and the valleys and warn everybody we should just sit down and
[34:43.120 --> 34:47.800]  shut up and go quietly into the night well you know what I'm never gonna do
[34:47.800 --> 34:56.760]  that and more knows I'm not perfect but I tell you what at least I'm fighting and
[34:56.760 --> 35:04.120]  at least I'm putting in long hours and doing everything I can possibly to defend
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.720]  this Republic
[35:06.720 --> 35:19.560]  it's time for the denial to end it's time for people who have wedded
[35:19.560 --> 35:26.160]  themselves to an evil system to realize they're laughing at you to realize
[35:26.160 --> 35:35.120]  there is no lesser of two evils that's what I'm begging you out there to let
[35:35.120 --> 35:38.520]  burn into your minds and I'm talking to the people who know we're telling the
[35:38.520 --> 35:41.640]  truth of research what we're saying I'm asking you to call in to other talk
[35:41.640 --> 35:48.640]  shows I'm asking you to set up websites I'm asking you to get my films and make
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.320]  copies and aggressively get them out I mean I mean it when I say it and to go
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.480]  on the message boards and to email your email list and to tell them to tune into
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.760]  this radio show today and any other radio show that's telling it like it is
[36:01.760 --> 36:06.120]  because we woke in the people up but we've only woken them up to a threat and
[36:06.120 --> 36:09.440]  that they're being lied to they don't know how how they're being lied to they
[36:09.440 --> 36:14.120]  don't know have any inkling just how bad it is and they're being diverted off
[36:14.120 --> 36:19.240]  into all these other spin controls and into these little rabbit trails and into
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.080]  these steam valves and I just it just makes my blood boil frankly a lot of
[36:24.080 --> 36:30.760]  days it just makes me sick at my stomach just disgust me our bureaucracies our

[42:21.640 --> 42:26.520]  I called because I have a problem and I don't know how to get rid of it I got a
[42:26.520 --> 42:32.400]  visit from a truan officer he told me I have to register my child with the state
[42:32.400 --> 42:37.960]  or the district school when I called there's no state superintendent of
[42:37.960 --> 42:44.960]  schools and I called Charlotte it's a bit and she told me to call the state but
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.960]  there's no there is no way you can because there is no supposed state
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.040]  superintendent okay okay what they do all over the country I don't know New
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.480]  Hampshire law but it's generally the same so I'm not giving you legal advice
[42:58.480 --> 43:04.120]  but I'm telling you generally what the law is in California in Illinois they've
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.480]  openly tried to ban homeschooling first they say oh when you don't have your
[43:08.480 --> 43:13.200]  child in our system you've got a sign of form saying that they're not in our
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.160]  system even of their private school or homeschool total control here's the state
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.200]  saying they're the guardian which which they've now openly announced and so
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.080]  they're giving you permission there's no law in these states they just say it then
[43:26.080 --> 43:29.880]  they openly try to claim you have a have to have a teaching certificate to teach
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.920]  your children there's no law but by fiat they will send CPS they will try to
[43:34.920 --> 43:38.600]  call an abuse they will you know because it's educational neglect you're not
[43:38.600 --> 43:43.000]  socializing them it's all total color of law but they'll trick and bully you so
[43:43.000 --> 43:49.000]  be in America into signing forms waving rights now they're very angry because
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.960]  they want to get your child registered into the system then they can start
[43:52.960 --> 44:00.080]  micromanaging and you need to call the county or that particular school
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.120]  district find out particularly which jurisdiction that that truant officer is
[44:05.120 --> 44:12.200]  under and I mean first off how old's your children 11 okay and how long have
[44:12.200 --> 44:17.520]  they been homeschooled since the beginning he probably went to parochial
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.000]  school for one month when we lived it back in Missouri and when we moved back
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.280]  here so some neighbor probably called you in yes a piece of field what it is
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.760]  yeah a piece of scumbag so so how do you I mean you know a scumbag get it yes
[44:31.760 --> 44:36.200]  so this un-American piece of trash you need to be kicked out of this country
[44:36.200 --> 44:41.080]  think CC because they on sitcoms and dramas and movies they imply it's
[44:41.080 --> 44:45.040]  abusive and Bill Clinton has said it Hillary said it that you're that it's
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.920]  abusive to not have your children in the government training camp see this is
[44:47.920 --> 44:52.080]  land of the coward some of the place and so this cowardly piece of filth called
[44:52.080 --> 44:56.600]  this scum on you and so now they don't have any evidence of abuse but they're
[44:56.600 --> 44:59.760]  gonna try to get into your house now even if you sign the form you're gonna
[44:59.760 --> 45:04.200]  probably have CPS knock if they see any dirt any dog here on the ground any
[45:04.200 --> 45:08.240]  dishes they will then come in force sometimes police will physically put
[45:08.240 --> 45:12.720]  their hands around your neck folks this is standard and squeeze until you sign
[45:12.720 --> 45:16.560]  forms they will then grab your child take them and hop them up on drugs when
[45:16.560 --> 45:20.720]  they cry wanting their mother and you will enter a hell pit stay there I'll
[45:20.720 --> 45:25.160]  try to advise you on the other side and you will see I'm not trying to terrorize
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.160]  you man they're gonna terrorize you there's a good chance it's better to
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.800]  know that the enemy is coming okay the four horsemen are coming the enemy is
[45:32.800 --> 45:38.800]  coming to devour your family you need to you probably need to move

[46:44.200 --> 46:47.800]  statistically have the highest test scores of the cream of the crop sought
[46:47.800 --> 46:53.560]  after by the fortune 500 none of that matters okay and as millions more
[46:53.560 --> 47:01.360]  exodus the the the the the the prison training camps you're going to see a
[47:01.360 --> 47:05.840]  backlash by the government training camps trying to force you back in so this
[47:05.840 --> 47:12.800]  poor lady had a truancy officer show up she the mother 11 year old child went
[47:12.800 --> 47:18.240]  and got the quote booklet from the school it has one page a just a policy
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.000]  for homeschoolers see but it doesn't matter to this scum they will have
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.800]  through color of law with no law the truancy officer will then claim there's
[47:26.800 --> 47:31.680]  truancy and then call in color of law CPS again the total criminality of the
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.560]  state folks in your faith like they say there's a law you got to take vaccines
[47:35.560 --> 47:41.160]  no law they take kids every day in this town where I live for this okay
[47:41.160 --> 47:49.200]  thousands a year just where I live no law no let me explain the ultra evil of

[48:07.640 --> 48:11.320]  to wake the people up and these brainwashed scum who just think their
[48:11.320 --> 48:17.080]  authority is God I'm gonna shut up let's go back back to kitty in New Hampshire
[48:17.080 --> 48:20.880]  kitty I don't know your law there but it's pretty much the same everywhere and
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.440]  you said you went and got their quote law and it's just policies of the school
[48:25.440 --> 48:30.400]  that's he telling you never had them in their system what to do in New Hampshire
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.920]  please continue yeah and one of the things it says that it says that all
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.760]  these things are not required like state assessment test or any other
[48:40.760 --> 48:46.360]  particular assessment and essay use which I'm not even familiar what essay
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.640]  yeah but but but but let me guess the the what did the truancy officer say
[48:50.640 --> 48:55.760]  when he came to your door and knocked on a law-abiding citizens door where he
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.000]  has no business I'm sorry go ahead well he other than the fact that he told me
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.600]  that I have to register my child with a school he handed us this booklet which
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.080]  which which isn't a law so now we know it doesn't say it's the law it says he
[49:11.080 --> 49:18.360]  says policy doesn't it what it yeah it says rules oh and and the one page that
[49:18.360 --> 49:24.360]  they give you it says common practices and under home education law now when I
[49:24.360 --> 49:33.080]  call the school district I was told that evaluation is the law but I have to have
[49:33.080 --> 49:38.760]  it but in the booklet itself it says you don't have to do it yes the one page
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.920]  but see but see the God on the other end has never read their own policies they
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.520]  just tell these dumb cops these stupid CPS workers and they go out and do stuff
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.480]  that isn't even a law they snatch kids every day that haven't had vaccines
[49:53.480 --> 50:00.080]  there's no law you criminal scum suckers what is your major malfunction and they
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.040]  think we're weird cuz we don't like this because we don't like them sticking
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.920]  their fat noses in our business I don't want to get him in the school system
[50:08.920 --> 50:13.000]  Alex and I don't know she would have taken him to court I don't know what to
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.760]  do well did he threaten you what did he say when he was there he said that I
[50:17.760 --> 50:22.480]  have he said that he only came up because this woman had called in and
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.600]  reported him so the only reason that he came up was because she keeps bothering
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.280]  him going well have you done anything yeah we know she's and I bet she doesn't
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.840]  have kids she's the mommy though at a subconscious level she's a jealous of
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.840]  you having children she's some feminist leftist and well and now she wants to be
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.520]  the mommy of your child hey lady you didn't carry him for nine months
[50:46.520 --> 50:55.000]  he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

[53:46.400 --> 53:50.120]  right in there with a video camera got footage of it all busting the window out
[53:50.120 --> 53:54.320]  on his daughter and about midnight we're all down there protesting this is
[53:54.320 --> 53:57.480]  hours later it happened about seven o'clock at night there's about a hundred
[53:57.480 --> 54:01.040]  hours out protesting outside the jail and Mike calls me on the cell phone is
[54:01.040 --> 54:04.760]  one phone call and he goes listen they've been torturing me they're trying to
[54:04.760 --> 54:09.800]  force me to sign a document it it says that I'm guilty of all these crimes and
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.280]  frankly I thought Mike had gone crazy I was ignorant I guess this is about nine
[54:14.280 --> 54:22.160]  years ago was this like 98 97 I thought that I thought Mike was lying and I
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.960]  didn't know Mike to be a liar I just couldn't I was I was naive folks they
[54:26.960 --> 54:29.920]  wouldn't let the big protest upstairs they'd let people individually and so I
[54:29.920 --> 54:34.120]  went in up to the big glass window and I'm talking to the jail guard one of the
[54:34.120 --> 54:38.320]  people there and I said yeah Mike was just telling me that you gave him
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.640]  something called a personal bond but that it can I see one of those and she
[54:42.640 --> 54:51.160]  said sure have one and I turned it over and it said that he had could he that
[54:51.160 --> 54:55.740]  anyone who signed it had committed all these crimes and agreed to a
[54:55.740 --> 55:00.000]  fortification to take we calculated it was like over three thousand dollars in
[55:00.000 --> 55:07.120]  classes and then you're on probation for six months but but then you've got to
[55:07.120 --> 55:14.600]  pay all and then and then go into the system drunk driving robbery family
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.160]  violence I mean it was nine different things and so we covered it on the TV
[55:19.160 --> 55:22.920]  show CBS then had a local newscast we've got somewhere in the archives where they
[55:22.920 --> 55:26.840]  say think you're innocent till proven guilty not in Travis County you're
[55:26.840 --> 55:33.920]  guilty until proven innocent you see in America we're so brainwashed the cops
[55:33.920 --> 55:39.920]  the jailers everybody that they think that's normal oh and I forgot the part
[55:39.920 --> 55:42.160]  about Mike said listen they've been torturing me they're trying to force
[55:42.160 --> 55:45.480]  me to sign documents and some personal reconnaissance bond I won't do it no
[55:45.480 --> 55:51.000]  please and then you it's and then Mike later gets out says they choked him they
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.160]  stopped him they did pressure point then he does a Freedom of Information Act
[55:55.160 --> 56:00.320]  request gets the video and they're so arrogant he chose him on the phone in
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.040]  the hall they hear him and they're all around him three of them and they all
[56:04.040 --> 56:07.400]  start putting their hands around his neck on his body and the tape cuts out
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.880]  and goes black they gave him the whole shift hours of video right there for
[56:11.880 --> 56:18.240]  about three minutes it goes black and so we've got to get that tape and put that
[56:18.240 --> 56:21.680]  on TV again and just show people so literally I'm on the phone and he's
[56:21.680 --> 56:24.080]  saying he's being tortured he's saying they're trying to force me to sign
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.680]  documents and I hear no no not again I mean you know this is this is what's
[56:28.680 --> 56:35.360]  going on in America I didn't believe it later I saw the video they didn't cut it
[56:35.360 --> 56:38.560]  30 seconds before it started they're so arrogant it shows them putting their
[56:38.560 --> 56:41.800]  hands on him and one putting their hands around his neck and then it goes black
[56:41.800 --> 56:50.440]  that is America that's who these people are their enemies of this country and I
[56:50.440 --> 56:56.560]  tired everybody kissing up to them they come take people's kids when there's no
[56:56.560 --> 56:59.800]  law to take a vaccine they come take their kids when there's no law to
[56:59.800 --> 57:03.160]  enroll them in the school system they come and they engage in criminal
[57:03.160 --> 57:11.760]  activities with force of arms in a concerted organized syndicate and I'm
[57:11.760 --> 57:15.240]  tired of kissing up to the whole system it's all criminal individuals may not
[57:15.240 --> 57:19.680]  be criminal within it but the system is completely bankrupt completely
[57:19.680 --> 57:25.000]  reprobate completely evil just like it's been in every other society freedom was
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.120]  an incredibly rare thing folks and it's going down the toilet right now you know
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.480]  it's going down the drain the last bits of freedom are draining down the
[57:34.480 --> 57:54.920]  drain right now and you need to get mad about this I mean
[58:04.480 --> 58:25.520]  I mean dirty Soviets knew it was bad and knew it was evil and knew to hide it and
[58:25.520 --> 58:30.680]  get it sorry it gets me so upset it's just shame on you people in government
[58:30.680 --> 58:34.280]  ought to be ashamed of themselves till all this behavior is extincted but
[58:34.280 --> 58:37.880]  didn't go away it's getting worse kitty in new hamster finished up your story
[58:37.880 --> 58:41.000]  tell me what happened when he came to the door what was said what happened well
[58:41.000 --> 58:46.080]  he told me that I have I had to register him with a school either whether it be
[58:46.080 --> 58:51.000]  the state or the district now when I called Charlotte it's a bit to ask her
[58:51.000 --> 58:56.480]  for advice she said you don't want him in the district you want in the state now
[58:56.480 --> 59:03.840]  the state when I called they're telling me that I have to I have to read her
[59:03.840 --> 59:10.880]  refer back to where I am now this goes back to this John Cook shank who is the
[59:10.880 --> 59:17.760]  true and officer and they are the ones that when I called them yesterday they
[59:17.760 --> 59:24.240]  informed me that my son would have to take an evaluation it is the lot and
[59:24.240 --> 59:27.680]  they were really belligerent about that oh yeah cuz you're hey you're the bad
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.040]  parent they're the real parent they're the state they're God you didn't know
[59:31.040 --> 59:34.480]  that you've been here to be talked about the airport screenings about all of it
[59:34.480 --> 59:39.620]  notice they're encouraged to be rude to us now get us used to it and so but but
[59:39.620 --> 59:45.320]  the book what they gave you said it's not the law right it's just rules and now
[59:45.320 --> 59:49.280]  I'm thinking that the only way I'm gonna get them off my back now is to take them
[59:49.280 --> 59:56.040]  to court well no you don't want to get entangled with these people do you rent
[59:56.040 --> 01:00:02.240]  your house yes I rent an apartment okay can't you just move out of the county
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:08.480]  to a county right next door and even still work at the same place and I could
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:14.360]  but it would be we just moved in here and we have already spent so much money
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.520]  I understand the first thing you do is get together with family whatever and
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.960]  you need to nicely let this neighbor know that that false charges you know
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.720]  claiming some type of neglect or something is is a serious civil penalty
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.520]  it's also a serious criminal penalty and that you're strongly considering a
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.320]  following that if you ever get you know any more of her behavior that's your
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.160]  right to homeschool and I would do it written don't do it with this mindless
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:45.600]  peon to her scumbag face how would I how do I handle this John John officer
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.960]  okay what did he say did he say I'm gonna come back and take your kid if you
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.800]  don't do this no what did he say he handed he handed us all these forms and
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.040]  these pieces of paper and when you could when you read all this paperwork this
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.680]  one page that deals with the homeschooling says I don't have to do
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:10.520]  any of this stuff but now at the same time this other paper that they give you
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:17.760]  they want you to circle whether it goes grades one through five or grade six
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.320]  through 12 and they want you to fill this out and it's got all the child's
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:30.960]  name date of birth address all this and now that and it goes back into all the
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:39.480]  evaluation and it will be done because it is the law well I'll tell you what
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.760]  they do in some of the states like California where there are four
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.480]  things evaluations I don't know the laws change New Hampshire CPS is there and
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.400]  doesn't interrogation trying to slip your kid up and we've got to teach your
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.560]  children folks not to talk people in uniforms we need to let them know
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.200]  statistically are the most dangerous individuals they will ever come in
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.680]  contact with and people with clipboards the system whatever just like you teach
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.000]  your children not to talk to strangers or bandits or you know to if they see a
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.280]  grizzly bear around the other direction stay there my dear it makes me so mad to
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:19.520]  see a woman cornered I just want to oh god I hope you curse every one of these
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:44.760]  people back when this country had log cabin education we had better industry
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.800]  better presidents better leaders many of our presidents were raised at home
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:55.680]  taught at home the system is designed to turn out mindless fad driven cogs it
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.840]  would be better to for your child to have no education than to go to public
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.760]  school and if you're insulted by that out there people who rationalize the
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.880]  schools teach your children how to be drug using permit promiscuous
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.760]  individuals who learn how to be frisk and searched and controlled by police
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:19.000]  period and that's why there's been an exodus from just a few hundred thousand
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.600]  homeschoolers eight nine years ago to I said three million the other day that's
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.320]  the number I saw a few years ago and I got corrected that it's over five million
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.200]  now and I was sent news articles and it's just gonna keep happening and it'll
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.080]  get to a point where you know half the population's got their children out of
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.320]  public schools that's why they want to destroy the economy so you can't afford
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.440]  to not be in their system and they're just trying to ban it your big problems
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.680]  that neighbor she's not gonna stop she'll look for anything God forbid your son
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.520]  you know be out playing and have a scratch on his knee not trying to scare
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.240]  you need to be prepared for her to say that that's abuse start calling on you
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.720]  well tell me about this neighbor I don't want to hear her name on there but tell
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.520]  me about this neighbor and and and and she ever approached you or I guess she
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.640]  approaches your son I would imagine that's what these creeps do tell me well
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:16.600]  she used to be a neighbor she she has a son she's on welfare and she's in the
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.520]  system and managed by CPS oh they're the worst so they think this is part of the
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.200]  system okay yes and they probably give her brownie points and tell her they
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.360]  won't take her kid and give her little goodies she's probably getting kicked
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.000]  backs for every child snatched okay now I see well we tried see we tried to give
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:41.360]  my son the idea of this two sides to the railroad and we wanted him to see what
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.680]  the other side of the railroad looked like and it ended up being that she's
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.840]  because I ended up telling this boy that I thought it was in the best interest
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.360]  for my son if he didn't come over anymore oh you don't want your son with
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:03.920]  this white trash come yes and that was cool or trouble started no it's see it's
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.400]  always and that's how Nazi Germany was that's how America now is it's all
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:15.280]  about vindictiveness and so and so this welfare trash she is total total
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.720]  scum does nothing but watch your television where on all the dramas and
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.760]  sitcoms and saving Amy and all the stuff they tell you on TV homeschooling is
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.000]  illegal that you can see it all over TV they imply it's illegal or that you're
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.560]  all abusive and so she ratted you out well you left that white trash no in a
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.440]  letter this is my I would do this I'm not saying you should do this you do what
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:42.840]  you want you let that white trash know that that if there are any more reports
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:48.600]  any more false reports that that is civil and criminal that you're gonna
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.160]  file suit against her that you need to send her she'll she's so ignorant go to
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.720]  Google print off mainstream news articles about something with some
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.800]  headline you just type in more and more Americans homeschooling circle it and
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:05.120]  say see it's not illegal be very mechanical in the letter no insults
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:09.800]  though I know you would it would be proper to and just say that this is
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.960]  horrible what she's done and then and trying to get you into the system and
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:22.040]  that and that that if there's any more false reports that you're going to

[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.320]  it it's the old frog in the pot of water you turn up slow it boils you were to
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.920]  throw it in scalding water it jump right out and right now it's boiling folks the
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.080]  eyes are rolling back in the head of the frog and I think about the things they
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.000]  do to innocent women like this lady and but man I don't want you to be too
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.920]  paranoid in the system a lot of times they'll come out won't come back out
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.040]  again your big problem is going to be this lady but if she doesn't still live
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.480]  by it that's a lot better and it may just kind of blow over and go away if
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:42.560]  somebody does knock on your door do not answer it get advice from the from the
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.760]  different homeschooling groups that we can put you in contact with if you've
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.520]  got a search if you've got a computer and if not go to the library take five
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.320]  hours if it takes it and it take me two minutes but once you learn how to use
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.920]  this stuff get the new Hampshire laws and have that and if you ever get
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.520]  confronted the problem is the thugs especially the CPS workers don't like
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.360]  to hear they're wrong so a lot of times you show them laws and argue with them
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.440]  it totally freaks them out because they have a lot of guilt and they just go
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.520]  nuts I mean you're being not you know this is like a stick up they're just
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.200]  criminals now it sounds like this truancy officer isn't probably doesn't like
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.600]  abusing people a lot of people in the system are good just because they're
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.240]  five times more likely to be abusive doesn't mean that's still a low number
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:32.120]  of them are but but but the law itself is criminal the law itself well again it
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:38.120]  isn't even a law but but the the the things they do it's all color of law
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.320]  okay I'm gonna go to your calls it's just that I want to be able to warn more
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.800]  people I want more AM and FM affiliates I want more people listening on the
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.360]  internet I want more people listening on shortwave I want more people to get
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:56.480]  terror storm and to make copies of it on DVD aggressively I want you to support
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.400]  us because because everything we do is about fighting the globalist and I just
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:09.240]  have such a desire a burning passion to to to to overturn these people to to
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.480]  punish them and to defend the weak to defend and then the ignorant and when
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.960]  we're all ignorant I'm ignorant I'm learning more every day I didn't know
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.680]  they tortured people and in the Travis County Jail I didn't know they tried to
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.560]  force everybody by threats to sign documents waving all their rights and
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.320]  agreeing to crimes they weren't even arrested for I didn't know that I mean I
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.120]  used to laugh even 10 years ago that fluoride was poisonous till I read all
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.600]  the university studies I didn't know all this it just I can't it's hard to
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.600]  believe how bad it is but you can find I'm going your calls I'm going to have
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:49.240]  Ian David and Johnny and John and Chris right now but but I didn't know just how
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:56.280]  bad it was I mean we live in this every day we don't know and and and the more
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.920]  I find out it's just a lot of people who live overseas or Americans who've lived
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.520]  overseas or travel who've been to dictatorships say that America in many
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:14.920]  respects is worse it's just people don't realize it because it's normalized
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.160]  because we don't communicate folks used to meet you know at the end of the
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.200]  street every night and you know cook cook hamburgers or talk or go on camping
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.400]  trips together church and people didn't watch TV they communicated and if
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.120]  somebody did that people flip out we have been gelded we have been
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.600]  domesticated let's go to heavy in California holding like a real trooper
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.600]  thank you never move quickly go ahead heavy hi Alex prison planet TV member
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.480]  for over a year for the past day I've been wondering whether you're trying to
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.840]  see how awake we are or if you're a shill for the New World Order because I've
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.720]  been irritated by the fact I'm trying to figure out why you posted the Oklahoma
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:05.800]  City Timothy McVeigh story it's clearly not not McVeigh in the picture well I
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:11.040]  disagree with you I mean I'm not a hundred percent sure but I checked with
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.440]  the professor I checked I mean I read over all the doc I mean have you read
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.760]  the accompanying documentation yes and others have to including editors we
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.920]  searched it and there's pretty much nothing and I mean this is serious
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.120]  business I mean we can't look like a national inquire tabloid I mean it
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:33.040]  hurt okay let me give me evidence you you search something I mean we're asking
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.880]  you for evidence more evidence I mean evidence it wasn't him I mean tell me
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.000]  the picture it's clearly not make that McVeigh I mean I can look at WTC 7 and
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.960]  clearly no without anything that it's a controlled demolition just like I can
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.800]  look at this picture it's not McVeigh well I mean your evidence is everybody
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.160]  saying it isn't him actually most people that have emailed us or what I've seen
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:01.120]  posted say number one this is McVeigh years younger than when you first seem
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.240]  on the scene the teeth of the same the eyes of the same the eyebrows of the
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:13.160]  same the voice is the same so and and I mean you're sitting here you know saying
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.200]  first you claim you had evidence you said we've searched it and then our
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.200]  editors what word editors mean it's a serious claim Alex no no you're saying
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:29.080]  edit you said I Google I Google Bill Bean and there's absolutely nothing what
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.800]  does that mean what does it mean I don't know maybe we need more can you give us
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.480]  more because it's a serious accusation I mean it's evidence you know we already
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.680]  know that all this is happening but I mean we can't become the national
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.560]  inquire is what I'm saying yeah kind of like kind of like I was the national
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.000]  inquire when I told you they were building FEMA camps not at all now I
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.920]  always got accused of that or I was a national inquire about North American
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:57.520]  Union or or one day after it passed we got the bill and I said it does affect
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:03.400]  US citizens HR 6166 and then people all over said oh no it doesn't say that I
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.080]  can't find it it says early in the bill it doesn't affect citizens but then I've
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.560]  had a train of legal experts and top scholars on and all these big
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:16.560]  university you know law professor heads breaking down the exact subsections of
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:22.680]  US code where it does say US citizens and and see I mean so and and certainly I
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.040]  do make mistakes we're wrong from time to time if you're looking for somebody
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.640]  who's a hundred percent the last time that happened what was Jesus Christ and
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:37.320]  I'm certainly not Jesus Christ right so so I give you a quote okay from the time
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:43.720]  for decision 1944 government official Sumner Wells he goes on to say quote
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:49.200]  when the right time comes stimulate internal dissension sufficiently to
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.840]  destroy the morale of the people now knowingly or unknowingly we all could
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:01.360]  be contributing to their plan so what I'm saying is you've taught us well Alex
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:08.600]  search dig question sources the truth can be used as propaganda to destroy
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.560]  morale yeah well one could say what you're doing now is is is one of the
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:21.640]  better examples of that Alex I'm a believer yeah well number one I've
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.440]  never asked anybody to believe in me I've always said the opposite I'm not
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.480]  watching it I'm not your leader I don't claim to be pure as a driven snow I
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.400]  don't claim to be some perfect saying I am legitimate what I do is legitimate I
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:40.720]  am doing my best to tell the truth I am doing my best to reach out to people and
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:50.240]  I appreciate your call I've also said many many times here on air that 9-11
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.240]  was probably meant to come out to a certain extent just like JFK they did
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:00.280]  that sloppy so some people in the know would know and I've said many times that
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.240]  if we just sit here and blame George Bush for 9-11 and we act like George Bush
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.320]  and the neocons are the final arbiters and the final people and if we don't
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.960]  expose the fact of European Union owners own this country and are using us as
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.600]  their front their engine to go dominate the world and then we take the blame
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.920]  it's like Rupert Murdoch demonizes us in his newspapers and TV overseas but
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.680]  then builds us up and tells us to go along with the war here domestically
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.480]  that's a clear sign right there everything they do is to destroy the
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.420]  family on their TV shows you know the worst programs all of that look at the
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:40.160]  fruits conversely I'm telling you I mean you hear me talking about Barack
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.200]  Obama and Hillary all day now I say that's a diversion they're all puppets
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:49.480]  we get 8% turnout the local level 50 something percent nationally depending on
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.920]  the year between 50 and 60 percent we need to start focusing locally taking
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.480]  control I tell you to be a leader I tell you to get involved you are not and you
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:04.440]  are not going to hear that from operatives we never spend our time
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.800]  attacking other so-called patriots even people we know our feds because that will
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.800]  just turn into a big diversion it'll actually give them more attention you
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.320]  know the whole people we weren't sure of now we are sure of all the
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.560]  ridiculous stuff they're putting out on 9-11 you know I have to weigh all of that
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.040]  and so the the number one thing you can see in a co-intelliprial operative is
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.440]  all they'll do is tell you they're the only leader don't trust any of these
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.520]  other groups everything's infiltrated everything's watched I'll tell you
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.520]  everything isn't infiltrated they don't have as much power they tell you they're
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.640]  spying on everybody to intimidate you they they can spy they are spying but
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:48.320]  it's all in basic breakdowns and algorithms you know they can't go look up
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.640]  billions of people and what they're doing it's all an intimidation I'm telling
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.240]  you we're going to win this thing I'm telling you we can win I'm telling you
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.680]  we can get the Republic back I'm telling you we don't want to get violent and then
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.800]  Alex is a fed he never says we ought to get violent and these websites talk about
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.240]  all the people they want to kill if they weren't feds they'd be arrested in
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:19.840]  hours another thing feds don't operate for 12 years they don't in almost every
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.040]  case they don't I mean it doesn't matter the North American Union is here are
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.240]  you going to fight it are you going to stay on issue and message look just do
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.800]  yourself something that's easy in a favor okay it isn't true but just decide
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:39.000]  I'm bad okay just just decide I'm bad if that if that'll get you to move on to
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.120]  some real issues see because most of these websites and organizations and
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:50.760]  groups they nanny they don't get out and fight the New World Order they don't go
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.320]  start organizations they don't find ways to reach out to more people they'll
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:01.080]  nanny about how I'm not doing the show right they'll nanny and perseverate on
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:06.360]  how I should do a better job hey I have never claimed to be perfect and I've
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:14.040]  never sat here and said that that I've got all the answers I looked at the
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:23.160]  McVay photos stills I looked at the McVay you know one big thing is if you
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.360]  take the video of McVay and you take the color out because he's so tanned and
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.760]  then when you seen he's all pale from jail you take the picture because we did
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:39.160]  this just because Kevin made a copy of the news article and gave it to me and I
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:43.560]  look cool that looks even more like him that is him you try taking the color
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:49.040]  photos we've got try making a Xerox copy of them off a color print out or do a
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.680]  black and white print and then you really see it what a lot of people to see is
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:57.880]  at the top of the heads covered they see the skin is super tanned I mean he's got
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:04.800]  very dark skin he's got a you know a very deep tan
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.880]  you look at that you look at the nose you look at the teeth you look at the
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:18.840]  eyes you look at everything and it is a spitting image of McVay and then a major
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:25.800]  university professor did the voice test and said that it is a quote high match
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:35.920]  and that a very a very unusual voice again very unusual voice that has some
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:42.200]  type of speech impediment now it won't be the first time and it won't be the
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.200]  last I don't think it's a baloney story but it won't be the first time and it
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:52.640]  won't be the last if it is that I've been taken we get up here and we we admit
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.040]  to that in fact let me just give you some ammunition against me while we do this
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.440]  don't worry folks a new order somebody I'll probably kill me I'll probably go
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.400]  to prison you know and you can dance around and say I'm bad when that
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.240]  happened you know it'll feel good because you can't pull down the new world
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:11.880]  order you think so just go ahead and go after Alex Jones
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:20.600]  here I'm gonna give you some ammunition Sam Danner I'll remember that guy and I
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.800]  should have known the sources that was coming from some of the biggest operatives
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:30.160]  out there on the globe total baloney but the guy sounded so
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.640]  incredible you know that mean the greatest minds out there and cloak and
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.240]  dagger on the enemy side get fooled I mean that this stuff is hard you try
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.600]  doing this three hours a day on air three hours of preparation you try then
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.720]  trying to make films do TV shows the radio I did in radio interviews this
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.640]  morning I'll be on Lars Larsen tonight I'll have to fight to see my family I

[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.000]  measures I think you do a masterful job your treasure on those issues of I'm on
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.800]  the left I voted for workers org right in because I agree with you about the
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.720]  Democrats and Republicans both being a party of war but and I'd be even
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:53.240]  advocated on three national radio programs your terror storm everybody
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:59.240]  get that on on Google but I have a serious disagreement I would ask some
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:05.960]  people to check out a website called the watch dot pair PA IR dot com forward
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.720]  slash JBS watch dot pair dot com forward slash JBS and it's got a well
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:17.560]  documented bibliography of how the John Birch Society is a intimately tied
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:24.600]  in with the NSA the CIA the FBI through its Western goals spy organization
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:30.800]  that evaded a lot of the prohibitions against buying to funnel a lot of the
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.520]  spying operations for the National Security Agency the FBI CIA and its
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.680]  connections to Reinheld Galen the Nazi spy master who was brought into the CIA
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:48.280]  and Western intelligence after the Second World War a Western gold under Larry
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.040]  McDonald actually set up the Western branch of that and collaborated with
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:57.040]  this Nazi other ultra-right fascist groups like the World Anti-communist
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:02.280]  League and others who specialize in the kind of assassination that death squads
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.640]  that Oliver North was involved in are also interlocked with that and many
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:11.040]  people like HL Hunt this ultra-rightist who was many researchers say was
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:15.280]  implicated in the Kennedy assassination was a major flunder of the John Birch
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.080]  Society but this this article which is put out by a Christian in the last part
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:24.120]  of it I don't agree with it because it in some ways it actually picks up some of
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.160]  the John Birch Society ideas but it documents all of these fascist connections
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.440]  of the John Birch Society and I think that in some ways you've been influenced
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.920]  by some of this and on those issues I think you're going to be brought right
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:43.200]  back into the neocon camp all right what's the website again John it's a
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:51.560]  watch dot pair pa ir dot com forward slash JBS and I think it would open a
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:56.040]  lot of eyes about the John Birch Society's connections even to the CFR the
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:04.480]  other way John I I appreciate your call waging war on corruption Alex Jones on
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:17.800]  the GCN radio network Big Brother mainstream media government cover-up you
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:25.280]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now

[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:45.480]  the third and final hour I want to get more into the North American Union on
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.040]  the top CFR members that wrote up the current plan being implemented said hey
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.280]  and one more terror attack we're going to be fully in the North American Union
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.960]  that's what it's all going to be about a North American police state capturing us
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:05.560]  as a slave to carry out their global war against any sovereign nation or people
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.720]  I will get into that in some other reports here about the warmongering
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:16.480]  Democrats but right now let's go back to your calls let's go ahead and talk to
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:22.240]  Chris in Florida than Dave Maggie and others welcome Chris thank Alex I first
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.400]  after disagree with you even though I'm just that's not the reason they called
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:31.120]  up I don't don't go off and curse child protective services or anybody I mean
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.160]  they're hateful enough and all you got to do all you do when you when you just
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.680]  return that hate is you you complete their circuit just short-circuit their
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:45.200]  anger follow Jesus advice love and bless your enemy well you're probably right I
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.000]  just said I wish God would do something to them I'm just I was crying out to God
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.800]  about these pieces of filth they call it incredible pain I'm tired of them
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:02.160]  right just give it to God and that's right and I want to give some legal
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.760]  information I normally wouldn't do unless I felt like somebody like you would
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.280]  want to follow up on it possibly or someone wants to fight a ticket a
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:15.040]  code violation anything that you'd have to pay with with cash I understand you
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.960]  got another ticket and this is what I used I mentioned it once before they
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:26.520]  tell me the law well what I what I do is I offer them lawful money and I use
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:32.120]  only two different laws I use a title 12 of the US code section 152 that defines
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.760]  lawful money as a golden silver coin to the United States and I also use the
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:44.520]  uniform commercial code section 3-603 which when they refuse the lawful
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.200]  money which is a gold or silver coin to the United States that does work
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.560]  sometimes but now they're so criminal they will still just disregard it but a
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:57.440]  lot of people try to pay their debts now with pennies or they make
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.360]  banks take their their payments and pennies and it's devastating and it
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:05.560]  makes them really mad but it's a great thing to do oh that's I never I never
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.800]  thought about that but yeah I've tried it the state attorney had no argument
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:14.480]  against me they simply said the uniform commercial code doesn't apply and I
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.720]  asked how but they had no response and yeah they don't have a law so then you
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.080]  try to pay their non-law under a law and then they say the law doesn't count I
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.920]  know it's lawlessness folks wait they try to act under the the juror I'm sorry
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:35.000]  the de facto government instead of the juror it's by fiat right and then for
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.800]  calling the talk shows I call in the talk shows and you can call them these
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:44.080]  talk show host coward don't be afraid of it tell the audience that you can't
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.640]  trust a coward because they'll always tell you out and the talk show host will
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.920]  normally be quiet because he thinks that you're about to hang up but you can just
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:56.200]  keep going on usually you you tell the talk show host if they were really
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.240]  anti-war the one that pretend to be they would talk about certain issues the
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.880]  depleted uranium's a great one you know the anthrax how the treats are being
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.200]  the anthrax vaccines are the back if you really support the troops you talk
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:11.600]  about how they're at the pay for themselves to be flown back when their
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.880]  legs are blown off yes there's so many different issues the North American
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.600]  Union if you were anti-globalism you talk about the the North American Union
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.680]  instead of pretending like you know no such thing is happening yeah that's
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.800]  what the national hosts are still it's the it's the mainline neocons won't even
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:35.640]  talk about it well I'm surprised even Glenn Beck did I know that amazed me but
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:44.320]  yeah yeah yeah I just can't imagine that you know he's not he's not for the
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:48.320]  other guys but I just can't so thank you and often the Watson brothers for all
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.960]  your articles I use those a lot for notes I make a brief outline before I
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.520]  call and talk shows and record them to confront them if they cut you off hold
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.080]  them through their words when you call them back later thank you for the call
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:06.640]  I really appreciate it lots of calls tons of news straight ahead stay with
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:20.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-up you want answers well so does
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:27.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:33.680]  Alex Jones in the wheel here never know what interesting direction our
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:40.040]  callers will take us 1-800-259-9231 and I will run through more than news we got
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:45.800]  about 51 minutes left in this transmission against tyranny 1-800-259-9231
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.400]  let's go ahead and talk to David and Canada than Maggie Kevin Dillon and
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:55.040]  others welcome David thank you Alex how you doing today pretty good I hope you
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.560]  did I'm a first-time caller to your show but I want to tell you I greatly
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.920]  admire your honor courage honesty and integrity which are unfortunately rare
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.280]  commodities with people today up here in Canada I've been following the North
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:10.680]  American Union with particular interest and I'll tell you the media up here
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.560]  does not cover it at all like there was no as bad as you say your media is I'd
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:19.760]  say there's been 10 times the coverage in the Canadian press I've probably seen
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:25.280]  80-90 and I've probably missed most of them articles in your papers saying the
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:29.640]  end of Canada well it's interesting you say that because I know when they had
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:34.600]  the meetings up in Banff with all the big wigs including our Minister of
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.960]  Homeland Security Stockwell Day and including most the members of the
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.520]  of the media I mean that is a big editors to keep it quiet yeah yeah and it
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.800]  was funny because the Craig and Canyon which is just like a local Banff
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.400]  newspaper was the one who broke it they covered it for one day and that was it
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.480]  there was nothing in the Globe and Mail nothing in the now for those who forgot
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.600]  about that a few months ago tell them you have the North American Union with the
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.800]  leaders of the three countries of the other State Department's meeting and
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.840]  hundreds of top CEOs telling them how to set it up because again it's all a big
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:07.600]  orgy of feeding they set up a new government design it for taxation
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:13.640]  grids tell folks about it well it was it was incredible too because our former
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.440]  Premier Peter Lockheed who I used to have a tremendous amount of respect for
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.000]  was one of the co-chairs along with George Schultz and somebody else from
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.400]  Mexico again it was what what's really struck me was again that that day the
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.040]  story was sort of touched on briefly for one day and then it was just buried and
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:38.280]  actually confronted the CBC bureau chief for Ottawa on the radio about it and he
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.960]  hummed it hard about how it was a secret agreement we really don't know much
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.680]  about it you're right we should be really looking into it a little bit more
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.000]  and oh boy ought to send me that audio clip yeah well I don't have a copy of
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.200]  it but but I guess and and so I you know again I want to thank you because you've
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.600]  really opened my eyes to a lot of the way the media basically shapes our
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:05.320]  opinions as opposed to informs us and you know and and and I guess the only
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:08.840]  thing I can throw out which I would not only throw out to you but I would throw
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.040]  out to your listeners as well as is the idea it's kind of a physics
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.720]  premise called Boyle's law which is that water under a hundred degrees
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.200]  doesn't really do much but once it reaches that kind of critical mass
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.440]  becomes an unstoppable force and and I think all of us I have your videos I'm
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.920]  definitely talking it up with people and a lot of the time when I talked to
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.320]  people about many of these issues and try to inform them about 9-11 about North
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.640]  American Union about the way we're moving toward a police state they they
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.240]  don't really read it doesn't register at all I'm I'm quite amazed sometimes that
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:50.560]  people who I consider very intelligent very very educated you know strong
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.680]  engineering and scientific backgrounds you confront them with things that and
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.880]  that was one of the things that woke me up with the speed of the collapse of the
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.240]  world trade centers it didn't make sense at all and when when I sort of read a
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:05.080]  little bit about the physics behind it that totally shifted my opinion to
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.760]  everything and it was subsequent to that that I kind of stumbled across your
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.400]  site but but I think we just need to keep talking to people and keep planting
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:17.320]  the seeds and keep you know chatting with them about it not necessarily in a
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.480]  confrontational way because you don't necessarily want to close that door
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:24.560]  forever but you want to keep just going back to them and telling them you know
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.360]  I agree we need to we need to spend our time reaching out to others instead of
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.160]  nitpicking who our leader is in the fight against the New World Order and
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.480]  who's the best and who you know you be the leaders folks get out there take
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.000]  action absolutely absolutely and and I think the day will come one of the
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.040]  things I noticed about the media today when I compare it to like 30 40 years
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:50.720]  ago you know 60s that kind of time frame is there was a lot more ability for
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:54.760]  music and some of the popular culture mediums to kind of boil to the surface
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:57.960]  I'm thinking Bob Dylan and some of those yeah that's why they are punished the
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.920]  Dixie chicks was to set a precedent hey you'd be you know that's why they fired
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.000]  that hockey player for not worshiping and signing the flag for the troops if
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.240]  you're saying you're gonna support the war you're fired you're going to go
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.520]  along with this this is how it is yeah and and I'm I'm hoping that artists out
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.280]  there I I I for play a lot of music myself and one of the things that I'm
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.120]  trying to do is you know get up there and sing about these issues and because
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.080]  again people be more receptive to hearing things sometimes in a different
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.160]  medium than they will in a verbal discussion right and I don't know I
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.360]  know that you mentioned at one point there were a number of artists who sent
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:39.440]  you music that talk about different aspects of I mean it's all over the web
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:45.520]  listen I got a jump I appreciate your great call but look you know we keep
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.600]  saying people aren't waking up but then you look at the statistics 80 plus
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:56.440]  percent don't have a good view of the Congress 70 plus percent are against the
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.280]  war including 70 percent of the troops 90 plus percent are against all these
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:06.440]  trans-Texas corridors and land grabs 99 percent are against the Supreme Court
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:12.560]  ruling 90 plus percent are against the North American Union in polls I do
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.960]  radio interviews every single day and it's a rarity now that people calling
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.880]  and disagree with me I mean last time I was on the big you know neocon Lars
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.240]  Larson show on hundreds of stations I'm back on it today so I use that as an
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:34.360]  example be back on the night schedule and he took I don't know eight nine
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:41.200]  calls and I think you know one of the people disagree with me I mean that's
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.440]  because the folks are off the reservation they're not buying into this
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:47.880]  phony conservative bills they're not buying into the phony liberal bills they
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.040]  know it's just two flavors of the same Kool-Aid filled with cyanide basically
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:46:00.360]  psychologically intellectually and so again I'll say it I am not here to lead
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.480]  everyone or to have all the answers or to know all the answers I got a pretty
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.360]  good handle on what's going on we've had an effect I know we can win I know we
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:14.320]  can take action and I just want you all to take to get involved and then a lot
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.320]  of other folks they get involved behind me no do not get involved behind me and
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:22.440]  watch who else you get involved with it's better just have lots of you out
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.120]  there taking action and getting involved and it's an it's an idea it's a way of
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:36.680]  life that's unstoppable ideas as V says are bulletproof and it's true they
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.320]  cannot stop an idea and their strawman attacks and everything they do are
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.040]  failing let's go ahead and talk to Maggie in Texas thanks for holding
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:54.880]  hello Alex as you probably noticed the Austin newspapers and TV are currently
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:00.480]  full of stories about this family with five us autistic children who are
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:06.080]  getting a home makeover from one of those reality shows and the media is
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:13.280]  giving a warm fuzzy spin to this very tragic story so I would like to say
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.720]  three things first what do you make of this five children out of six autistic
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.920]  in one family secondly I already knew about the family I had heard about them
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:29.440]  and there was an extremely good article about a year ago in USA Today which I
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.200]  have located including a revealing photo gallery would you like me to send that
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:39.800]  to you and third would you consider having perhaps one of these parents on
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.680]  your show after the assignment dies down yes I I heard an inkling of this
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.400]  frankly I'm not too focused on local news and I know you're not and I should
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.760]  be I just can't stay focused on all of it why don't you give us a little bit of
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:02.080]  background on it and then I'll comment on why autism is up well over 10,000
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:06.400]  percent but but let's go ahead right now and and fill me and others in who
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.720]  aren't aware yes okay I have just refreshed my memory on this via the
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:17.440]  internet myself I first ran across something about this family probably a
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.040]  year or so ago surfing the web because I'm I'm interested somewhat in autism
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.360]  myself following to there being an autistic child in the family and what I
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:34.760]  found was there they have five they have six children's their name is O'Donnell
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:42.080]  and there they have six children between the ages of maybe 14 and two or
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.720]  something like that and in other words a very big range age range and all but one
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:53.640]  of them have been diagnosed with some form of autism okay and so now they've
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.640]  made a TV show out of it isn't it cute no well what happened is it's not well
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.080]  that's peripheral it's not really peripheral but they are getting they
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:09.520]  were chosen for this makeover yeah and so of course there's plenty of isn't it
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:18.560]  cute I'm sure but the focus is on the house however I I refreshed my memory on
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:25.400]  the internet and I found that about a year ago I guess it was March 05 and
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:32.160]  our a writer a USA Today writer named Sharon Jason who actually was with the
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.920]  statesman previously had written a very much more detailed article describing
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.560]  the family I would say with some depth and compassion and there's even a photo
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.000]  gallery included in this story which is online and it shows the kids and I
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.920]  recognize the postures of these kids because I've been around autism plenty
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:58.000]  you know the the arched feet walking on tiptoe this kind of thing and that is the
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:05.240]  story they had the first child was stopped talking at one and a half years
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.040]  it's always 18 it's always 18 months yeah that's that's exactly what it says
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:16.600]  and then they had they were told it was not hereditary and they went ahead and
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:21.760]  had three more children in a very in a relatively short time and let me guess
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.200]  they went and got their vaccines like good parents well now it doesn't say
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.720]  that and that would be something to dig out but it's always 18 months listen I
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.480]  appreciate your call let me comment on this I was gonna say hereditary not that
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:37.920]  I thought it was that but it could be but it's still vaccine related this is
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:44.160]  what happens well I'll I'll give you the medical facts on the other side and I
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:53.360]  appreciate your call Maggie then we'll talk to Kevin Dillon and others 1-800-2599-231-800-2599-231
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.200]  I'm Alex Jones the wartime broadcaster on the front lines engaging the global
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.360]  crime syndicate at point-blank range in a laugh and ditch effort to save the
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.000]  Republic and our families
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:37.040]  you're on personal Jesus I'm one to hear your prayers someone who cares welcome
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:44.280]  back your calls here in a moment that let me break this down there is a gene
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:55.360]  that is missing or altered in a small percentage of humans that allows more
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:06.960]  mercury that is digested to pass through the intestines I forget if it's the
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:11.640]  large the small you can go look it all up it's mainstream news and so you
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:17.840]  normally build up mercury and so it is from eating fish eating foods it's in
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.840]  the environment and so you have a much higher statistical chance if you're
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:30.720]  missing that gene to naturally from what's in the environment to to for the
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.880]  mercury to make it through and to get into your bloodstream and to build up
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:37.960]  and cause brain damage which is even more devastating when the brain is
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:43.200]  developing in the first four and a half to five years and so statistically the
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:50.280]  children that get vaccines who also don't have that gene get even higher
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:54.400]  level because they're not just getting it from the food now they're also getting
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:59.920]  it from the vaccines but that makes up a small percentage of all the autistic
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:05.200]  children and the numbers are I keep saying from 24 years ago this number's
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.840]  about two years old I need to pull up the new ones I've seen reports saying
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:12.800]  it's far worse now but statistics are always a few years behind but new ones
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:21.880]  are coming out 24 years ago 1 in 25,000 had autism it was unknown it was
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:26.400]  incredibly rare now every major public school in this country has entire
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:35.720]  classrooms just for the autistic children we've gone from one 24 years ago in
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:40.680]  1 in 25,000 to 1 in 168 that's the number from came out two years ago that
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:44.680]  were from two years before so that'd be two years ago two years it'd be 2002
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:50.160]  numbers okay and the press reports are saying the preliminary data they're
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.320]  crunching right now this is this is a CDC and universities is it's going to be
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:03.080]  1 in 75 or 1 in 80 something I'm going from memory here so it's just
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:07.800]  unbelievable by the way it just came out that a lot of the psychotropic drugs
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.960]  not just a schizophrenic drug for schizophrenia are causing diabetes as
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:17.280]  I said it's a cocktail as I was reading reports the plumber he's down the
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.240]  finals are out these are major universities these are drug company
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.240]  studies as well that a lot of these psychotropic totally burn out different
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:31.000]  glands in the body you throw a bunch of sugar on top of that and it pushes it
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.560]  over the edge so that's why what is it 1 in 3 now have some form of
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.880]  diabetes I couldn't believe that number and they're trending you said they
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.480]  reported what earlier this year that they're saying half the population by the
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.720]  end of the decade it's coming and then this isn't over reporting this is
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:54.160]  people getting their legs sawed off folks I mean I'm sure you've heard that
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.000]  you've seen on the news I mean it's just all getting insane everybody'll just be
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.400]  dropping dead around as soon and it'll just be well everything's fine just take
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:10.800]  more pills eat your rotten the radiated beef he it's a whole bunch of things
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:16.960]  doing this but I mean I go to the park to walk my dogs and with my family and
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.240]  and there might be 10 families out there and you almost always see an
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.680]  autistic child you walk on the green belt you see autistic children everywhere
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.680]  you go to the mall you see them everywhere you go to church you see them
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:36.720]  everywhere and I mean now it's going to be 1 in 75 and it was just keep getting
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.440]  work and then they tell you oh there's no connection to mercury doing it but
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.840]  we've taken the mercury out of the vaccines then the associated press
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:48.680]  reports no they went from 50 times safe levels the 250 times safe levels in most
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:54.960]  the major vaccines they just made small run lots available if your doctor happens
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:02.920]  to order them so you can get some vaccines without mercury the marital and
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.440]  then there's a big lawsuit with all these thousands of families with their
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.840]  kids with autism because they're not stupid most autism I mean I've been in a
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:15.160]  hot tub at a hotel on vacation I've been on the hiking bike trail I mean I've
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:19.600]  talked to hundreds of I've talked to pediatricians it's 18 months third
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.360]  round of shots a lot of times the child's gone before they get him home in the
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:29.160]  car and a lot of times the child's having a seizure they take them back to the
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.800]  doctor the doctor calls CPS of the child's grab because they claim they
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.760]  shook them and the government sick folks they do this and then they've got an
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.520]  added little caveat on top of it and sudden death the infant syndrome a lot
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.320]  of times it's the first round of shots they die within hours of that little
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.920]  baby goes to sleep don't ever wake up you go ahead and take your shots don't
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:56.440]  listen to this nut you know because I read all the surveys of the documents and
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:03.480]  I'm evil we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:26.960]  radio network
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:30.920]  yeah if you look at when they there's been whole studies done on this when they
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.800]  started vaccinating children with a larger and larger group of shots you
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.400]  know before it was just one or two then it was five ten right at birth they
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.000]  started having children die right then or they would have them die at the second
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.480]  round of shots at six months to eight months and they'd have the baby go home
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:54.960]  and die and then the American Medical Association comes out and says oh yeah
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.600]  it's the it's the baby bedding doing this it's the and I know the parents are
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.640]  really beating them to death and so they sent a whole bunch of what was hundreds
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.720]  of parents went to prison then it later all came out that that it was a genetic
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.680]  disorder causing it it all just started right with the vaccines but again
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:18.760]  everything's fine your government loves you so not only do they murder your
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:23.240]  child because you believe the system and are totally gullible and of course the
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:28.040]  doctors don't know they just believe the system the nurses just a nation of
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:32.040]  basically the new-old order that's why their symbol is the all-seeing eye on a
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:38.120]  pyramid it's a pyramidal power structure with compartmentalized need to know
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:45.320]  information with an eye at the top it can see everybody else is blind but that
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:48.920]  eye at the top it's got all the information it sees the plan but you can
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.960]  look at what they're doing and see the plan the question is will you have the
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:58.320]  nerve to admit how horrible it is when you actually behold it it's kind of like
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:01.640]  having a grim reaper at two inches away from me and all you see some black
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:05.840]  fabric you need to step back a little and you can see it's the grim reaper boys
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:13.000]  and girls and I've seen it I've seen what it is and it it makes me sad it makes me
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.760]  nauseated it makes me angry and I just want you to share in my anger and I
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.760]  want to take action against these people because the world's never going to be a
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:25.720]  perfect place but Lord knows if you if good people don't stand up things get
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:31.440]  real bad there's no limit to how bad they get as Thomas Jefferson said the
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:35.560]  exact amount of tyranny you will live under is the amount you put up with
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:39.200]  that's the way it is there's always going to be some new evil group that's
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.560]  going to take it even further than the last who's going to supplant the last
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.480]  ruthless group it's it is survival of the most evil and that's who gets into
[01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:52.200]  control and then you got a bunch of naive people who are just blind to the
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:58.520]  attack blind to the fact that we're under attack you see the New World Order
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:03.000]  isn't about manufacturing cars it isn't about you having a nice vacation it
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.160]  isn't about happy families it isn't about milk and honey it's about control
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:15.800]  and dominance of thought of ideas of raw materials of societies let's go ahead
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:21.800]  and take calls let's talk to Kevin in Boston thanks for holding you're on the
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:27.080]  year worldwide thank you for taking my call Alex I wanted to touch on a
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:31.320]  couple of things I don't think I'll take more than say a minute and a half as far
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:34.760]  as any Alex Jones errors Colin if you can remember as he I've been listening
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:39.200]  faithfully pretty much the last like six years and the only error I can recall at
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:44.800]  all was the Anton LeVe carry on the stage hoax which was you know you have you
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:49.640]  posted it at the hoax and corrected it within hours of the initial thing coming
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:54.640]  out and that's pretty much it you normally report carefully on your own
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:00.400]  things but you take the time to do careful analysis on what people say on
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:04.840]  your show when they call in as far as what this color was talking about with
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:10.160]  the Timothy McVeigh video all that your article is asking is that they that this
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:14.600]  is enough to reopen the investigation I think that's certainly true alternative
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.000]  new sources as I say yours what I find is the most neutral wide open and unbiased
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.400]  I can get on your call and never screened not like anywhere else it's the
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.560]  best source that I've been able to find it's not left it's not right other
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:32.920]  sources I do have some sorts of bias I read rents daily it's a true free speech
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.080]  zone he's been on your show he's great but some stuff absolutely true but he's
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:42.680]  a wide open free speech area where some of the stuff speculative and can be
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:45.920]  out there and he doesn't try to restrict it to be true it's it's open for
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.720]  speculation of some folks that you've taken issue with that I listened to
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:54.640]  Lenny Bloom over in a cloak and dagger and his Tom Hennigan and those folks you
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.600]  know rents can be accused sometimes fairly run fairly being anti-semitic
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:04.360]  cloak and dagger certainly takes a anti-catholic Vatican anti-vatican stance
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.240]  I'm Catholic but I still listen to what their viewpoint is what they have to say
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.480]  they're more speculative true they'll report rumors and therefore their
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.000]  vulnerable and which has been proven to disinfo and miss info they are openly
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.400]  pro-french new world order with Patrick Fitzgerald investigation type stuff is
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:24.400]  gonna and he's gonna fix everything he's gonna indict everybody and then it
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:29.800]  doesn't happen they've also attacked you as being you know sympathetic and to
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.160]  pro-vatican bias perhaps just because your friends with no gifts and they have
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.920]  a problem with that or something I don't know but they do reveal some good
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:42.080]  info such as the fact that Barack Obama's wife is a lobbyist for the
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:45.960]  South National Bank which is part of investigations related to the funding of
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:51.400]  all some of this covert lack of activity on some other type things I've seen a
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:55.400]  John McCain John McCain the puppet of the Phoenix Arizona mobster network
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:00.600]  Kemper Marley was the mobster that they call him anti-corruption he's part of
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:05.320]  the Keating five absolutely part of the Sam Brompton
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:11.000]  corruption al Capone yeah and and you know Kemper Marley had a guy go to
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.120]  jail Jim Hensley and when he got you know he was defended Marley himself
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:18.800]  avoided that prosecution because he was defended by William Rehnquist who goes
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:22.920]  on to become Supreme Court Justice Don Bowles let me briefly go back to the
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:28.920]  McVay thing you see I what we're so busy here that that that we don't even have
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:33.640]  time to do the best job well you know we could and we have the time I was online
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.440]  and looking at pictures of McVay on the army with this deep tan a little bit
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:45.360]  beefier and we went in and today I pulled the photos up total spitting image
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.400]  with this this this video we've got more so than comparing him to the you know
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.360]  goblin in jail cell for two years so we're gonna be posting that with the
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:59.200]  video as well and up on the site on prisonplanet.com and jonesreport.com
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:04.760]  in the next few hours wait till you see these photos next to it the evidence
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.280]  that has caused reason for reopening of that investigation more evidence has
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.600]  come forward we're just reporting on an actual news publication is reported on
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.080]  it the final point I wanted to make is that you were talking about your site
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:24.160]  is nonviolent and I want to advocate that in non-reactionary they want to
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.600]  provoke us into being wild but at the same time I would ask the people not to
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.880]  necessarily join anything not to post anything but to just look at the site
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:38.560]  awrm.org and read through it okay listen I got to move on to other
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:45.000]  callers I appreciate your call but still this is inward-looking I would have to
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:54.560]  say half the reportage going on in the alternative media is about ourselves and
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:05:00.360]  by that I mean nitpicking everyone attacking everyone we don't do it here
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:06.240]  people attack us all the time and we don't respond a lot of times mainstream
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:11.280]  media attacks people like why aren't you responding because I just that's not
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:16.120]  what the broadcast is about we're looking at the new world order we're
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:21.080]  fighting the big admitted systems that are in front of us and most the people
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:26.480]  attacking and running around are just egomaniacs most of them aren't coming
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.440]  to tell pro or disinfo operatives they're just egomaniacs and they hate
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:36.680]  everybody else and it's all about their ego okay but there are disinfo groups
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.400]  out there you saw them lose their funding in the last three months for the
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:43.760]  election that's a pretty funny they all rose like coal sores at the end of that
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:49.680]  announced all their hiatuses are leaving the country and the rest of it you can
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:55.880]  always tell them and it's pretty easy you know it's not very hard and all
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:06:00.560]  mainly all they do is attack other people and tell you you can't trust
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:05.320]  anybody and tell you we're all under surveillance and they're unstoppable and
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:10.520]  they're invincible and and we've got to do all this and everybody's bad but me
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:15.120]  me me me when the truth is we got a nation of people that are starting to
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:20.440]  wake up that are good people that love God and love their country and they just
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.040]  want to get you instead of fighting the new world order instead of organizing and
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:29.240]  meeting and having organizations and groups and rallies and putting out
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:35.200]  media materials they want you just constantly knitting and nitpicking and
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:42.840]  and you know doing all of this and that's why other radio networks don't go
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:48.800]  anywhere other patriot networks in the past if they ever figured out not to do
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:56.880]  it they'd shoot up like a rocket which I wish they would you know you mean a lot
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:00.440]  of it is seen as a business thing you know other people make films other
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:07.280]  people write books other people have radio networks and the lies and I don't
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:10.400]  have time to go listen to it even read it all I just scan it occasionally and
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:15.480]  it's so ridiculous and it's kind of good though because it's gotten so ridiculous
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:22.440]  that it's just over the top you know it's like Mark Twain said rumors of my
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:27.960]  demise have been greatly exaggerated reports of my demise I mean every week
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:33.160]  it's that Genesis isn't going to be here next week and and that we're you know
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:39.080]  this and that and I think that shows people who we're talking about right
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:45.440]  there these purely destructive business reasons probably it could be
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:50.680]  something else or some evidence to that but in the process of destroying those
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:54.720]  people I would shut down a venue that has some good people on it they're not
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:59.720]  all controlled and it would probably give them more attention than they've ever
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:04.320]  gotten I mean I sometimes I don't like to talk about how big we've gotten
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:09.320]  because because I frankly don't want the attention I don't want the spotlight on
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:14.600]  me but I mean the new older knows no doubt I don't like walking point I
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:19.440]  frankly don't like the attention though it was a time ten years ago I did to an
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:23.840]  extent six seven years ago now I absolutely can't stand it people tell
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:29.080]  me how great I am I see a overweight bleached out burnout person who works
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:39.080]  all the time who's who lives on adrenaline who's very sad and it just kind
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:42.080]  of disgust me because I don't have a very big view of myself and I'm just like
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:46.600]  please stop telling me how good I am please for God's sakes just man the
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:52.800]  guns with me help me fight the new older please please please it's for my
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:58.520]  family it's for your family I mean I can't believe stuff the Patriot community
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:03.920]  lets people get away with either I mean just unbelievable stuff on the radio
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:09.920]  stuff that's just off the charts bad but in a sick level a lot of these people
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:14.400]  out there who sought leadership positions even in minion level they like
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:19.280]  infighting they like they like you know that type of stuff it's its
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:27.280]  entertainment to them and again because I show people their true face I'm the
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:34.160]  bad man I'm the bad man well if I need to be the bad man that's fine I don't
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:43.280]  care but but so let's just say I'm bad and Lord knows I am folks we're all
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:49.400]  pretty darn bad and so let's just let's just not argue the subject just come
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:52.680]  like with the government I go okay let's say jet fuel did bring down tower one
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.360]  and two we know that didn't happen but sake argument fine well I'm kind of like
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:00.480]  tower one and two let's just say I'm bad okay now can we please look at
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:05.200]  building seven over here will you please stop spending half your time out there
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.040]  nitpicking and knitting around and will you please help me here at the front
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:16.080]  lines fight the New World Order okay you don't want to fight next to me then you
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:24.560]  at least go fight you see you've been engineered to lose we've been built to
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:33.720]  be a bunch of knitting cowards and knitting is the word
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:42.480]  knitting is the word and if people don't like to hear me say land of the coward
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.440]  home of the slaves I'll just say it more because if we're ever going to get
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:49.720]  back to being land of the free home of the brave we have to admit how
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:11:03.000]  disgustingly pathetic we've gotten I want my soul literally cries out burns with
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.360]  the desire to protect these innocent women and children that is my instinct
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:19.120]  I is what a man a warrior is and all I want to do is protect the weak and I
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:27.280]  feel violent towards the strong that abused the weak I like taking bullies
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:31.800]  and knocking them down to size I like seeing bad cops lose their job I like
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:35.000]  seeing congressman go to prison but I'll tell you I'd like to see David
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.840]  Rockefeller go to prison I'd like to see Lord Rothschild go to prison I'd like
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:45.280]  to see that that that that blasphemous whore of the New World Order Queen
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:51.280]  Elizabeth and I look at the six systems that serve these people and these these
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:56.240]  these selfish husk of humanity these cowards these hordes of cowards that
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.200]  serve evil and I just I just I just hate your guts but I don't fight you
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:10.360]  because I hate you I fight you because I love the innocent and I love beauty and
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:18.080]  I see the magic in life and I know life is precious and short and I know I mean
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:23.360]  look at us we're on this planet orbiting a yellow dwarf sun way out in the
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:28.800]  hinterland on the edge of the galaxy looking into the galaxy with hundreds of
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:32.560]  billions of galaxies that have been photographed around us we're here one
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:40.320]  time big deep blue oceans filled with life trees forest clouds sunsets all of
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:46.400]  it and all I want is people to be able to live and work the land and work in
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:49.880]  factories and be happy and have good lives it's like that song there's
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.600]  another kid that'll never get to go to school never get to you know have
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:58.080]  friends never get to be cool can you queue up that song I want to play that
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:05.800]  right now just the first few minutes of it I mean man has got enough problems
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:10.760]  without an elite that tries to foster and push every weakness in us because it
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:16.000]  makes us easier to manage when we're a bunch of brain cattle and I see a bunch
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:23.760]  of wannabe macho men that think it's tough to have arm wrestling contest with
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.200]  other patriots and other people and who think it's cute to run around talking
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:32.120]  about how they're holier than now and I've got the nerve to tell me what I
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:36.840]  should do when I know without a shadow of it out I work harder than any of them
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:42.920]  and when I frankly woke up almost every one of them look at the fruit this is
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:46.880]  bored and let me tell you this tree is sickly but compared to what you've done
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:51.200]  compared to most of what you've done I brought in more fruit than a thousand of
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:56.960]  you combined out there and the fruit's good it's about recognizing the attack
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:11.200]  we're under what we face we'll come back with that song and this is a healthy
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:16.480]  discussion today because it isn't about me it's about all of us getting our
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:22.880]  heads screwed on straight it's like people who sit around and there's
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:26.000]  just some big job to do complaining about the right way to do it and a lot of
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.240]  people just have a fight with each other because it's easier to throw a fit and
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:36.640]  run off and not start digging into the job and getting it done I mean I want to
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.400]  puke every time I get a phone call or an email or a letter telling me what
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:47.040]  better I need to do what more I need to do knit picking people have never done
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:53.960]  nothing you're gonna be in a world of hurt a lot worse than it is now if you
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:15:00.640]  don't become a leader and get involved right now put your shoulder to the
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:27.960]  wheel final segment final call straight ahead
[01:59:43.580 --> 02:16:50.560]  I feel a woman in the night with her baby in her hand, there's a no-screen light,
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:58.360]  you're near a garbage can, but now she puts the kid away, she's gonna get a hit,
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:28.240]  she hates the lights and likes to jump in it, there's one more kid and I never go to school, never get to fall in love, never get to see, never get to go to school, never get to be cool, the government ships in the smack, the cocaine, all of that, what a joke, increases drug use just like prohibition, they
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:33.360]  know what they're doing, what a joke, you contribute to the drug war, you contribute to
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:40.720]  most the misery in this society, you got to be ashamed of yourselves, let's go ahead
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:53.040]  and talk to Dylan in Texas, Dylan you're on the air go ahead, I was just gonna say I went to a couple things really quick here I went to a 9-11 truth meeting here in
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:57.280]  Houston last night, they're probably about 20 people obviously the goal is to get that
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:06.840]  number up a lot, but we were just talking about places to go for information, your name came up quite a bit and I was just gonna tell you someone threw up there, well he's one of those UFO guys and I just want you to know that I
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:17.560]  definitely corrected him on that, I just am amazed at me where people get this stuff from, because the enemy's attacking me brother, and the power of the enemy's attack is people then parrot it, yeah exactly and then they
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:33.320]  like well okay, we're just sourced for that, one thing I wanted to ask you, this is like a, I'm not trying to be nitpicky here, I just have a serious question that I think you've probably thought about too, so we're almost out of time, go ahead and ask it, okay good, people like, I've seen Morgan Reynolds and David Taylor at the end of the thing and I think they've
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:47.540]  given some valuable information, but why, like I've seen like three minutes segments where they're out of cable news channels and they'll bring up the fake plane thing, or the planes were weird and I just think there's so much evidence to prove it's in such a way, yeah they didn't do that, they didn't do that until now, and they didn't do that when I
[02:18:47.540 --> 02:19:16.540]  interviewed him for Terror Storm almost a year ago, well six and eight months ago for one, over a year and a half, no a year and a quarter ago for the other, yep that's, hey have discernment sir, yeah I appreciate it, I apologize to Tom and Jeff and others, you'll have to call me back tomorrow, that was a good broadcast today, talked about some things that are important, some things that needed to be discussed, and I shall return tonight,
